McKillip. It was first published in hardcover by Atheneum in 1982, with a paperback edition issued by Berkley Books in August 1984. Summary The semi-autobiographical coming of age story of Frances Stuart, a sensitive, imaginative child and \\"army brat\\" whose life is disrupted by her family's moves from Arizona to Germany and England. As a second grader in a nun-taught parochial school she is instill with dread of sin and retribution, and as she grows she continues to be tormented by self-judgment and discomfort in regard to her sexuality. The former she unloads in writing on an invented \\"shadow sister,\\" while the latter she symbolizes as a \\"Stagman\\" who appears to her when she experiences unwelcome erotic feelings. These fixations continue to trouble her as a college student in Los Angeles and as she strikes out on her own, finding her own voice as a writer in the Pacific Northwest and ultimately a writers' colony in New England. Reception Barbara A. Bannon in Publishers Weekly, noting McKillip's status as \\"[a]n author of outstanding books for younger readers,\\" calls this, \\"her first novel for adults, a real spellbinder.\\" She observes the story's \\"sensitive, balladlike prose\\" and calls the section on the protagonist as a college woman in California \\"the story's high point.\\"Bannon, Barbara A. Review in Publishers Weekly v. 221, iss. 4, January 22, 1982, p. 60.

In its unassertive intimacy and fragility--and despite its rare literary grace--\\"Stepping From the Shadows\\" seems a small publishing miracle, whose appearance on the spring list means that an editor loved it, not that anyone thought it would make a dime.\\"Champlin, Charles. \\"Pleasant Reflection on Coming of Age.\\" Review in the Los Angeles Times, March 26, 1982, p.

The serial novel was left incomplete due to the fact that “there are no extant copies of the May 1862 issues, which probably contain the final chapters.” A book version, edited by Floyd Miller, was published by Beacon Press in 1970, and later a corrected edition, edited by Jerome McGann, was published by Harvard University Press of Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2017. Blake; or The Huts of America has been stated by Katie L. Chilies as chronicling various permeations of a diasporic, Black nation- state, exemplified by the transnational odyssey of its protagonist, Henry Blake, through the American South, Canada, and Cuba. She has also stated that Delaney's writing takes an anthropological approach in the ways it highlights Black American southern dialect, national identity, and geography through Blake's interviews of enslaved persons located on the plantations passed through along his insurrectional journey.  Plot = Part 1 = The story begins on the Franks Plantation in Natchez, Mississippi. Maggie, the illegitimate daughter of Colonel Stephen Franks and wife to Henry Blake, is sold off—a decision determined by both her relationship with Mistress Franks and rejection of Colonel Franks sexual overtures. Henry, a slave to Colonel Franks and husband to Maggie, is galvanized into action when informed of this tragic incident. Despite the religious pleas from Maggie's parents, Henry embarks on a subversive mission through the antebellum south. Through exposition, it is revealed that Henry was not born into slavery but free in the West Indies to well-off tobacco planters. Blake's fortune takes a drastic turn when he conflates a slave vessel with that of a battleship and is consequently kidnapped to America and sold to Colonel Franks. Henry meets Maggie on the Franks Plantation; they soon marry and start a family. On his revolutionary quest through plantations in the antebellum south, Henry interviews the enslaved persons he meets, documenting their experiences and circumstances; and procuring information about interviewees’ participation in major U.S events such as the American Revolutionary War as well as organized anti-slavery, insurrectional stratagems. Successfully avoiding the ploys of slave catchers, Blake is able to spread his vision of radical revolt amongst the enslaved individuals he meets, eventually guiding a group of escapees to Canada. = Part 2 = Set in Cuba, Part two of Blake; or The Huts of America chronicles Henry's successful retrieval of his wife Maggie as well as his encountering an estranged cousin, Placido (after the Cuban poet Gabriel de la Concepción Valdés), and his joining a slave vessel headed to continental Africa with the hopes of leading an uprising on its return to Cuba, which is not successful. Instead, those Africans brought back to Cuba support Blake and Placido's establishment of the Oppressed Men and Women of Cuba: a secret society designed to eliminate Spanish colonial powers off the island. The serial novel is cut short shortly thereafter this point due to a lack of existent copies of the Weekly Anglo-African Magazine for May 1862, which is believed to have concluded the novel. In a 2017 corrected edition of the novel editor and historian Jerome McGann wrote an ending for the novel based on the 1843 events in La Escalera. In this ending, many of those involved in the fictional uprising are captured and killed, while a few others are speculated to return to continental Africa.  Publication and Editing  Part 1, or chapters 1-23, Blake was published by the Anglo African Magazine in 1859. Due to Delaney's travel and scholarship abroad in both West Africa and Britain, installments ceased until the Weekly Anglo-African continued publication of 24 additional chapters in 1862; The final six chapters of Delany's work are believed by scholars to have been in the May issues of the WAA, but there are no existing copies of them to date. Floyd Miller edited and collated the existing chapters from the work's earlier publications into a Book version. This version was published in by Beacon Press of Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Jerome McGann edited and produced a corrected edition that was published by Harvard University Press of Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2017.  Contemporary Response  Delany's novel was largely left alone in the years following its last serial installment in the WAA (1862). It was not until 1940, roughly 80 years after its last serial installment, that attention to Blake began to surface. This newfound curiosity for Blake continued to grow in the 50s and 60s, partially informed by its ideological influence on the types of Black revolutionary thought seen in the Black Power and Pan-Africanism Movements. Following the release of the book version of Blake; or The Huts of America, published by Beacon Press (Boston 1970) and edited by Floyd Miller, there began a surge of scholarship dedicated to Delany's work and Delaney himself as well as on the Anglo African Magazine (AAM) and the Weekly Anglo- African (WAA). However, due to the various textual errors and under-developed historical and contextual insights found in Miller's edition, some of that resulting scholarship has been said to be often informed by misunderstandings of the work. In 1998, novelist Samuel R. Delany (no relation) praised Blake as a strong example \\"of what is often referred to as proto-science fiction...about as close to an sf-style alternate history novel as you can get.\\" McGann's corrected edition of the novel in 2017 (Cambridge 2017) has been credited as having ushered in a new wave of continued scholarly debate regarding various thematic dimensions of Delany's work, some of which include: intratexuality, emigration, transatlantic revolution and collective authorship.

There are multiple varieties of each kingdom that express social motility that provides a unique evolutionary advantages that other species do not possess. This has made them lethal killers such as African trypanosomiasis, or Myxobacteria. These evolutionary advantages have proven to increase survival rate among socially motile bacteria whether it be the ability to evade predators or communication within a swarm to form spores for long term hibernation in times of low nutrients or toxic environments.  Communication  Bacterial cells are able to communicate with one another through the use of chemical messengers. These chemical messengers are passed from one cell to the next to control factors such as virulence, growth and nutrient conditions, etc. As first discovered in plants, diffusible signal factors (DSFs) have been found in bacteria such as Burkholderia cenocepacia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When individual cells are stimulated by DSF, it causes them to release their own DSF to spread the signal further and also to generate a response to the DSF often seen as growth, movement, or sporulation in unfavorable growth conditions. Via these chemical messengers, swarms of bacteria are able to increase the rate of survival compared to single cell bacteria on their own.  Benefits  = Predation = Traveling in groups, often referred to as swarms, is beneficial to the organism. For instance, when Myxobacteria swarms and feeds on prey, all individual cells release hydrolytic enzymes. This abundance of metabolic enzymes allows the swarm to easily degrade and engulf the prey. Interactions between separate species of organisms in a given environment is very common. Production of toxins, usually in the form of antibodies, allows for cells to ward off other organisms from infringing on their niche. Similar to the combined release of degrading enzymes, antibodies allow for a colony of bacteria to fight off surrounding organisms in the same habitat. = Survival = Increased survival rates are seen in motile bacteria. This can be attributed to factors such as Chemotaxis, bacteria's ability to sense and migrate towards nutrients. The Chemotaxis mechanism can be amplified by social motility to alert all cells in the cluster of bacteria to move towards nutrients. The same is true of any toxic substances and the avoidance of that toxic environment by motile bacteria.  Examples  Pseudomonas aeruginosa. = Swarming = Swarming motility is the coordinated movement of bacteria along a solid/semisolid surface. Swarming motility can usually be observed in a laboratory setting, depending on the conditions of media nutrient concentration, and the viscosity of the surface of the media. More information on swarming motility can be found here. = Gliding = Example of Social Motility of Myxococcus xanthus. Mechanisms that drive gliding motility are still unknown. However, despite lacking flagella, pili, and fimbriae, bacteria such as Myxococcus xanthus are able to move across surfaces in a gliding motion. Close studies of the myxococcus xanthus has proposed ideas of how the bacteria are able to move across surfaces. Inner membrane protein complexes, such as AgmU, propel the organism forward as these protein complexes function similar to the flagella complex of other motile organisms. These protein complexes, powered by a proton motive force, rotate within the membrane allowing cells to glide over surfaces. = Twitching = Built for use by many in the bacterial world, Twitching Motility is an important tool that bacteria use to move across moist surfaces. Twitching Motility uses a type IV pili that extends, tethers to a surface, and then pulls the bacteria forward. This allows for quicker growth across biofilms and fruiting bodies. Type IV pili is run by over forty genes that regulate this type of motility. Myxococcus xanthus ability to use gliding motility to move is very similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching motility.[1] Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very motile bacteria species but it has some drawbacks, in one experiment a team of researchers discovered that if they put pressure on colonies that exhibited the quickest motility it led to decreased production of biofilm formation but drastically increased rates of motility. They then compared their quickest strain to wild type species to see if there is a need for higher rates of motility in the environment but none came close. Overall increasing speeds did not increase the chance for survival in the long run.

As Israeli legal academic Yaniv Roznai's 2017 book Unconstitutional Constitutional Amendments: The Limits of Amendment Powers demonstrates, the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine has been adopted by various courts and legal scholars in various countries throughout history. While this doctrine has generally applied specifically to constitutional amendments, there have been moves and proposals to also apply this doctrine to original parts of a constitution.  Concept  In 1893, Michigan jurist Thomas M. Cooley endorsed the idea of implicit limits on the United States constitutional amendment power. Akhil Amar argues that an amendment that abolishes free speech would be unconstitutional. Richard George Wright argues that an amendment that entrenched white supremacy and reintroduced segregation would be unconstitutional. The idea of an unconstitutional constitutional amendment has been around for over a century—with it being embraced by former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas M. Cooley in 1893 and US law professor Arthur Machen in 1910 (in Machen's case, in arguing that the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution might be unconstitutional). This theory is based on the idea that there is a difference between amending a particular constitution (in other words, the constitution- amending power or the secondary constituent power) and revising it to such an extent that it is essentially a new constitution (in other words, the constitution-making power or the primary constituent power)—with proponents of this idea viewing the former as being acceptable while viewing the latter as being unacceptable (even if the existing constitution doesn't actually explicitly prohibit doing the latter through its amendment process) unless the people actually adopt a new constitution using their constitution-making power. Thomas M. Cooley insisted that amendments \\"cannot be revolutionary; they must be harmonious with the body of the instrument\\".http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/915/1/Roznai_Unconstitutional- constitutional-amendments.pdf Elaborating on this point, Cooley argued that \\"an amendment converting a democratic republican government into an aristocracy or a monarchy would not be an amendment, but rather a revolution\\" that would require the creation and adoption of a new constitution even if the text of the existing constitution didn't actually prohibit such an amendment. In a 1991 law review article, United States law professor Richard George Wright argues that if a constitutional amendment leaves a constitution in such a state that it is a \\"smoldering, meaningless wreckage\\" and extremely internally inconsistent and incoherent, then such an amendment should indeed be declared unconstitutional. Wright compares this to a scenario of a body rejecting a tissue transplant due to this transplant being extremely incompatible with the body to which it is grafted—thus triggering an immune response on the part of the body. In Wright's analogy, the constitution is the body and the amendment is a tissue transplant and while both can peacefully coexist separately, they cannot peacefully coexist together. While Wright rejects the idea that certain specific hypothetical amendments are unconstitutional (such as an amendment that abolishes one or more US states), Wright does agree with Yale law professor Akhil Amar's view that a hypothetical constitutional amendment that completely abolishes freedom of speech would be unconstitutional because such an amendment would also undermine many other US constitutional provisions and thus \\"leave standing only a disjointed, unworkably insufficient, fragmentary constitutional structure.\\" Such an amendment would not only conflict with the provisions of the US Constitution's First Amendment—such an override being in fact not unheard of—but also with an innumerable multitude of other US constitutional provisions. Wright also agrees with US law professor Walter F. Murphy's view that a constitutional amendment that legally enshrines white supremacy, limits the franchise to whites, requires both US state governments and the US federal governments to segregate public institutions, and authorizes other legal disabilities that clearly offend and even deny the human dignity of non-whites would be unconstitutional because--in spite of such an amendment's compatibility with the pre-Civil War US Constitution--such an amendment \\"conflicts fundamentally and irreconcilably with virtually all conceptions of the commonly cited constitutional value of equality.\\" In a 2015 article, Yaniv Roznai argues that the more that the expression of the secondary constituent power (as in, the constitution-amending power) resembles the expression of a democratic primary constituent power, the less that it should be bound by limitations (whether explicit or implicit), and vice versa--with the less that the secondary constituent power resembles the primary constituent power and the more that the secondary constituent power resembles an ordinary legislative power, the more that it should be bound by limitations (whether explicit or implicit). A variation of this argument was also endorsed in 2013 by Carlos Bernal-Pulido. Meanwhile, in a 2018 review of Yaniv Roznai's 2017 book about unconstitutional constitutional amendments, Joel Colón-Rios argued that the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine should only apply in jurisdictions where the constitution-making process was indeed both strongly democratic and strongly inclusive--something that Colón-Rios pointed out is not actually true for the processes by which many currently existing constitutions were made and ratified. In addition, Colón-Rios speculated as to whether the distinction between the primary constituent power and the secondary constituent power can actually be sustained at all in cases where the secondary constituent power is as democratic (as in, a genuine expression of the people's will) or even more democratic than the primary constituent power is--for instance, if an expression of the secondary constituent power involves the convocation of a democratic and inclusive constituent assembly or constitutional convention whereas an expression of the primary constituent power doesn't. In the same article, Colón-Rios wondered whether jurisdictions with constitutions that lack a legal mechanism to resurrect the primary constituent power should categorically reject the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine since the use and invocation of this doctrine in these jurisdictions would mean that certain constitutional principles there would only be capable of being changed or altered through revolution. In a 2018 review of Roznai's book, Adrienne Stone argues that there is a sound case that an amendment that transforms a constitution into some entity other than a constitution--for instance, by eliminating the rule of law--would be unconstitutional. Otherwise, according to Stone, the concept of a constitution would lack any meaningful sense. However, Stone is much more critical of Roznai's claim that constitutional changes that alter a constitution's identity (while allowing it to remain a constitution--simply a different constitution from what it was when it was first created) are unconstitutional. After all, Stone argues that a particular constitution's extreme malleability (and thus a particular constitution's rejection of the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine) can itself be considered a part of this constitution's identity. Stone also argues that the question of whether a constitutional amendment is indeed unconstitutional should not only be decided based on whether the constitution-amending process was democratic, inclusive, and deliberative, but also on whether the constitution-making process was as democratic, inclusive, and deliberative as the constitution- amending process was. Stone uses her home country of Australia as an example where the constitution-amending process was more democratic and thus a better representation of the people's will than the constitution-making process was since at the time that Australia's constitution was written back in the 1890s, Australian Aborigines and women were both excluded from the Australian constitution-making process--whereas both of these groups are full participants in any 21st century Australian constitution-amending process. Stone argues that, in cases where the constitution-amending process is more democratic and inclusive--and thus more legitimate--than the constitution- making process is, it would indeed be permissible to enact even transformational constitutional changes through the constitution-amending process (as opposed to through a new constitution-making process). National views about this theory The Indian Supreme Court building. Several decades ago, the Indian Supreme Court adopted the unconstitutional constitutional amendment theory. =Countries that have adopted this theory= India In the 1960s and 1970s, the Indian Supreme Court articulated the basic structure doctrine—as in, the idea that a constitutional amendment that violates the basic structure of the Indian Constitution should be declared unconstitutional.https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1404&context;=auilr This was a significant reversal from 1951—when the Indian Supreme Court declared that the constitutional amendment power was unlimited.https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1685&context;=yjil Honduras In 2015, the Honduran Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a part of the original 1982 Honduran Constitution that created a one-term limit for Honduran Presidents and also created protective provisions punishing attempts to alter this presidential term limit. This case was novel in the sense that a part of an original constitution rather than a constitutional amendment was declared unconstitutional. =Countries that have rejected this theory= Finland The Finnish Parliament enjoys parliamentary sovereignty: its acts do not undergo judicial review, and cannot be stricken down by any court, so the constitutionality of a constitutional amendment is a purely political question. A supermajority can immediately enact an emergency constitutional amendment. In 1973, President Urho Kekkonen requested a four- year term extension by means of an emergency constitutional amendment, in order to avoid arranging presidential elections. He succeeded in persuading the opposition National Coalition Party and Swedish People's Party to vote for the amendment, and got his extension. In response, dissidents formed the new Constitutional Right Party, which campaigned in the 1975 Finnish parliamentary election with the theme that Kekkonen's amendment was an \\"unconstitutional constitutional amendment.\\" However, they won only one seat, not being able to change the outcome.  Potential future applications  Erwin Chemerinsky called on the US Supreme Court to use the 5th Amendment to make the allocation of Electoral College votes among US states exclusively based on population. The US Senate's side of the Capitol Building in Washington, DC. Michael Dorf speculated about the possibility of the US Supreme Court declaring the unequal apportionment in the US Senate to be unconstitutional. In a 2016 op-ed, published just a month after the 2016 US presidential election, US law professor Erwin Chemerinsky argued that the United States Supreme Court should declare the unequal allocation of electoral college votes to be unconstitutional due to it being (in his opinion) contrary to the equal protection principles that the US Supreme Court has found in the Fifth Amendment. Chemerinsky argues that a part of the United States Constitution can be unconstitutional if it conflicts with some principle(s) in a subsequent US constitutional amendment (specifically as this amendment is interpreted by the courts). At around the same time that Chemerinsky published his op-ed, in an article in the Huffington Post, US law professor Leon Friedman made an argument similar to Chemerinsky's. (To avoid any confusion here, what Chemerinsky and Friedman are advocating in these articles of theirs is having the US Supreme Court reinterpret existing amendments to the US Constitution as opposed to having the US Supreme Court add new amendments to the US Constitution; the US Supreme Court is allowed to do the former but not the latter.) In a 2018 blog post, US law professor Michael Dorf points out that it is possible (as opposed to plausible) for the United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) to utilize the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine to strike down the unequal apportionment in the United States Senate (which violates the one person, one vote principle); in the very same article, however, Dorf also expresses extreme skepticism that the US Supreme Court (or even a single justice on the US Supreme Court) would actually embrace the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine—at least anytime soon. In a 2019 article of theirs, Yaniv Roznai and Tamar Hostovsky Brandes embraced the argument that was previously proposed by Rosalind Dixon and David Landau and thus argued that since the constitutional replacement process can also be abused, it would be permissible and legitimate for courts to strike down constitutional replacements that are not fully democratic or inclusive. In other words, Yoznai and Hostovsky Brandes argue that the more the constitutional replacement process resembles the secondary constituent power (as opposed to the primary constituent power), the more legitimate it would be for the judiciary to strike down any constitution that was produced through a constitutional replacement process.  Criticism  The US Supreme Court building. Mike Rappaport argues that the adoption of the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine would give the Court way too much power and undermine democracy and popular sovereignty. United States law professor Mike Rappaport criticizes the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine and argues that the adoption of this doctrine in the US would undermine popular sovereignty because nine unelected US Supreme Court Justices with life tenure would give themselves the power to overturn the will of a huge majority of the American people. Rappaport points out that having the US Supreme Court adopt this doctrine might not always result in outcomes that liberal living constitutionalists are actually going to like (for instance, Rappaport argues that the US Supreme Court could use this doctrine to strike down a new constitutional amendment that will overturn the 2010 Citizens United ruling due to a belief that this new amendment conflicts with the First Amendment and the idea of free speech that the First Amendment embodies) and also argues that such a move on the part of the US Supreme Court would obstruct the US constitutional amendment process even further because people might hesitate to put effort into passing a new constitutional amendment if they thought that the US Supreme Court could strike down the amendment and declare it unconstitutional. Rappaport is also critical of the tendency in the US to use the judiciary to achieve various constitutional changes outside of the Article V constitutional amendment process because this reduces the incentive to actually pass and ratify new US constitutional amendments since achieving constitutional change through the courts is astronomically easier than going through the extremely long and cumbersome Article V constitutional amendment process (as convincing five or more Justices on the US Supreme Court to agree with one's position is astronomically easier than getting two-thirds of the US Congress and three-fourths of US state legislatures to agree with one's position). Meanwhile, Conall Towe criticizes the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine for violating two canons of construction: specifically the lex specialis canon and the expressio unius est exclusio alterius canon. The lex specialis canon states that specific language should trump general language whenever possible--with Towe citing a statement by Professor Oran Doyle that \\"it is not permissible to over-write one clear provision in favour of an amorphous spirit that has no particular textual foundation\\". Specifically, Towe uses an argument that George Washington Williams previously used back in 1928--as in, \\"if the constituent power is all-powerful, and the constituent power is expressed via the text of the constitution[,] then it is difficult to see how implicit unamendability on the basis of constituent power theory can avoid [the] charge [that] it simultaneously disregards the constitution under the pretence of upholding it.\\" Meanwhile, the expressio unius est exclusio alterius canon states that the specific inclusion of one thing in a legal text or document excludes other things that were not mentioned in it. While Towe argues that a literal reading of the constitutional text can be ignored in cases where it will produce an absurd outcome--a move that is in fact permitted by the absurdity doctrine-- Towe rejects the idea that carefully crafted unlimited amendment powers are absurd. Towe also wonders why exactly any constitutional provisions were made explicitly unamendable if implicit unamendability is so obvious; after all, if implicit unamendability was indeed so obvious, then there would be no need to make any constitutional provisions explicitly unamendable. In contrast, if certain provisions were made explicitly unamendable, Towe wonders why exactly the draftsmen of a particular constitution would not have made explicitly unamendable all of the constitutional provisions that they indeed wanted to be unamendable. On a separate note, Conall Towe also criticizes Yaniv Roznai's conceptual framework in regards to primary constituent power and secondary constituent power for violating Occam's Razor, which states that the simplest explanations possible for various phenomena should be preferred. Professor Oran Doyle has also previously criticized Yaniv Roznai's conception of the people as primary constituent power and the people as secondary constituent power as separate entities for violating Occam's Razor--with Doyle arguing that constituent power should be best thought of as a capacity rather than as an entity.  Responses to criticism  In response to criticism that the unconstitutional constitutional amendment theory blocks constitutional change, US law professor David Landau pointed out that this theory has ways to get around it. Specifically, Landau argues that political actors can engage in wholesale constitutional replacement in response to a judicial ruling that declares a particular constitutional amendment to be unconstitutional and also argues that political actors can \\"exert influence over the court[s] through appointments and other devices[]\\" in order to have the courts deliver rulings in these political actors' favor. Thus Landau, along with Australian law professor Rosalind Dixon, argues that a \\"speed bump\\" is the more proper comparison for the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine and that while the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine can delay change --perhaps with the hope of allowing a new political configuration to emerge in the meantime--it cannot permanently prevent constitutional change because political actors have workarounds (specifically those mentioned earlier in this paragraph) to achieve constitutional change even in the face of an initially hostile judiciary.

It was originally built for the National Orchestra of Lyon and is their residence hall. It is also one of the first buildings in France to be built with Prestressed concrete. Acoustics The building was built without an acoustic study which resulted in the volume being too low for symphonic purposes, with a reflective concave back wall. The stage had no lateral walls, which resulted in the musicians struggling to hear one another. The wall was eventually treated to prevent strong echoes. Eventually a Phillips acoustic enhancement system was fitted to help with sound coverage and reverberation. The Organ In 1878 the renowned French organ builder, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, was commissioned to build a concert organ for the Trocadéro concert hall, under the supervision of renowned organist and composer Alexandre Guilmant. Because of the time constraints of the contract he did not have time to build one from scratch and had to use an uncompleted three-manual organ originally intended for the Church of Notre Dame in Auteuil, a district in the northwestern area of Paris, as the basis for the new instrument. The organ moved to the Palais de Chaillot when then the Trocadéro was demolished and was ultimately bought by the government of Lyon for the Auditorium.

A. ampullaceum became one of the first few fungi along with Anopodium epile and Podospora dagonerii, to be placed in the new genus Anopodium due to their unique spores that did not suit the description of the spores of the Podospora genus, which P. dagonerii had previously belonged to. The genus Anopodium deviates from other members of the Sordariomycetes class by two spore characteristics; firstly the pedicels of its spore in the apical position, and secondly due to its immature spores having spherical bodies with cylindrical apical regions. As of 1998 all three of these species are now considered to be one species, using the name A. ampullaceum. History Anopodium ampullaceum was first discovered in 1964 by N. Lundqvist in Sweden. A. ampullaceum was first discovered on blue hare dung, then lemming dung both in Sweden and was later discovered on rabbit dung in Oise, France. Lundqvist originally believed A. ampullaceum to be a member of the genus Podospora. Upon further investigation of the A. ampullaceum spores Lundqvist concluded that A. ampullaceum along with the two other closely related species he was examining, Anopodium epile and Podospora dagonerii, all belong in the newly formed genus Anopodium. These fungi spores begin as cylindrical or vermiform type hyaline and are non-septate, for this reason they can not be considered as Podospora spores. Lundqvist also believed that these 3 fungal species have evolved independently from a species closely related to the family Lasiosphaeria. Much later on in 1998 M.J. Richardson studied these three fungal species in-depth gathering samples from various regions of Sweden and France. Upon examination of the spores characteristics such as spore length and width and ampullate hair presence, Richardson concluded that these three species can all be considered the same species with the correct name being Anopodium ampullaceum. Related Species Anopodium ampullaceum is most closely related to and similar in morphology to A. epile. A. ampullaceum and A. epile differ most in the presence or absence of ampullate hairs of the top region of the perithecium, their spore lengths and widths, and their pedicel shape of the spores. Despite these variation A. ampullaceum and A. epile are still considered to be the same species under the name A. ampullaceum. Appearance Anopodium ampullaceum is most commonly characterized by its spores pedicels that face upwards toward the apex of its ascus. Its spores are polar with both an apical and basal side. The A. ampullaceum perithecia where spores are discharged is a non-stromatic, membrane enclosed structure, that is light in colour with a dark neck, and is covered in hair. The A. ampullaceum has a filiform paraphyses. The ascus is uni-tunicated with an invagination on the apical side and an apical ring that is barely visible. A. ampullaceum spores begin their cycle as a single cell with a spherical body and a cylindrical apical end. In the next stage of its cycle the spore becomes a two celled structure with the lower cell swelling into an ellipsoid shape and a dark brown upper cell. The pedicels of the spores have gelatinous bodies, and ampullate hairs on the neck. The ampullate hairs of the pedicels were considered as determinants of A. ampullaceum identification, but after further examination of various samples it was decided that the presence of ampullate hairs was far too variable to be a marker of the fungal species. Ecology Anopodium ampullaceum is commonly found in hare and rabbit dung, as it was initially discovered on Blue hare and lemming dung in Sweden. Prior to the merging of the A. ampullaceum fungi with A. epile and P. dagonerii, A. ampullaceum seemed to be restricted to leporid hare dung. By its modern name A. ampullaceum has been found in dung samples from Sweden, France and the United Kingdom.

Background The author previously served as a ghost writer for books credited to famous people and wrote articles about music for publications. Contents The book uses content about Whitehouse held at the NVLA archives at Essex University, which occupies 300 files. Jonathan Sale of The Daily Telegraph described some of the contents as \\"richly humorous\\". According to Sale, the comments written by the editor were \\"droll\\". Karl Miller of the Irish Times described the style of the comments as \\"a smart, media-wise, Jack the Lad commentary that knows enough to recognise it’s right to ask: was she right?\\" The editor argued that the changes Whitehouse advocated for would have negatively affected British culture, but he also believed that some of her points may have had merits. Martin Fletcher of The Independent wrote \\"From a liberal perspective, it's not the singularity of her opinions that unsettle, but rather the issues she got right\\". Reception The Daily Telegraph ranked the book four of five stars, giving praise for the \\"relentlessly jaunty tone\\" in Thomopson's commentary.

From 1941 to 1945 Peden served in the Royal Canadian Air Force as a bomber pilot, completing the majority of his tour of duty with No. 214 Squadron RAF, part of RAF Bomber Command. Following the War he returned to Canada and became a lawyer in Winnipeg. Peden has authored three books. He is best known for his 1979 memoir A Thousand Shall Fall, which former director of the Canadian Army Historical Section, C. P. Stacey, called \\"the best book any Canadian has written about his war experiences, and one of the best books about the war that has been written anywhere.\\"See Note 10 for full quotation.  Early life  David Murray Peden was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on 19 October 1923 to William Peden (1893-1972) and Elsie Pearl Baldwin (1890-1987), and was the third of five children. Peden spent most of his youth in Portage la Prairie, where he attended Portage Collegiate Institute. He completed his secondary school at Gordon Bell High School in Winnipeg. Peden's father was Scottish-born and worked as a railroad clerk in Manitoba. The Pedens are descendants of the 17th century Scottish Covenanter Alexander Peden (1626-1686).  World War II  = Enlistment, training in Canada: October 1941 – November 1942 = The Winnipeg Civic Auditorium, where Peden heard Billy Bishop speak in May 1941. Prior to his 18th birthday, Peden had become intent on joining the Royal Canadian Air Force. In the spring of 1941, aged 17, Peden attended a recruitment rally in the Winnipeg Auditorium at which Air Marshal Billy Bishop spoke. The rally enforced his enthusiasm to join upon turning 18. On the morning of Monday, 20 October 1941, the day after his 18th birthday, Peden visited the Lindsay Building where he enlisted in the RCAF, being given the rank of Aircraftsman Second Class and the service number R134578, and was ordered to report to No. 3 Manning Depot, Edmonton, on 6 November 1941. After a month in Edmonton, Peden was sent to No. 7 SFTS at RCAF Station Fort Macleod. Following training at Macleod, Peden was posted to No. 4 ITS, located at the Edmonton Normal School, reporting on 1 March 1942. On 23 April, Peden was assigned to flight school at No. 5 EFTS at RCAF Station High River. At High River, the new pilot learned to fly in de Havilland Tiger Moths, and on 16 May 1942, he made his first solo flight. After roughly 60 hours of flying time, Peden was given the option to transfer either to No. 7 SFTS in Macleod again, or to No. 10 SFTS at RCAF Station Dauphin. As the latter was a short train trip to his home in Winnipeg, he elected to go to Dauphin, leaving High River on 3 July. At Dauphin Peden trained extensively in Cessna Cranes. This training included formation flying. On 16 October 1942 he made his final flight at Dauphin, at which point his total flying time was approximately 225 hours. Peden left the station on 24 October, and while on leave at home, he received his commission in the mail on Monday, 26 October. On 7 November 1942, Peden reported to No. 1 \\"Y\\" Depot in Halifax. In the afternoon on the 20th, he was ordered to pack, and was subsequently boarded on the ship S.S. Cavina. The crossing took 17 days, and the ship docked in Avonmouth. Upon disembarkment, Peden took the train to No. 3 Personnel Receiving Centre, RCAF in Bournemouth. = Training in England: November 1942 – September 1943 = Peden was sent to the Personnel Receiving Centre in Bournemouth where he was issued with battledress, identification, and clothing coupons. Along with ten other Canadian airmen, he billeted in the Burley Court Hotel. On 22 December he was granted seven days' leave, and subsequently traveled to Glasgow to spend Christmas with his aunt. On 29 January 1943, Peden was assigned to a fill-in posting for 12 days with the 14th Army Tank Regiment (Calgary Regiment), stationed in Worthing. After returning on 10 February, on the 26th he was posted to No. 6 EFTS at RAF Sywell. During this period, Peden and three other airmen billeted with a family in Northampton. While at Sywell, Peden continued his training in Tiger Moths, and in March was certified to fly with a bombaimer. On 23 March he was assigned to No. 20 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit at RAF Kidlington. The course at Kidlington included ground school, solo flying in Oxfords, cross-country flights to practise navigation, night flying, and beam approach training. On 18 May 1943 Peden reported to No. 12 Operational Training Unit at RAF Chipping Warden to begin his bomber training in Vickers Wellingtons. Peden noted his first impressions of the Wellington, saying, \\"[o]ur very first glimpse of the Wellington IIIs, squatting heavily in the dispersals ringing the drome at Chipping Warden, made us sharply aware of the nearer presence of the God of War. For the Wellingtons looked very much like what they were, battle-tested operational heavy bombers [...].\\"Murray Peden, A Thousand Shall Fall (Stittsville: Canada's Wings, 1979), 166. On the 29th he was assigned a crew, which included P/O J. B. Waters, Sgt. \\"Stan\\" Stanley, Sgt. Eddie Jarvis, and Sgt. Sam Mather. On 4 June Peden's crew transferred to RAF Edgehill to begin their flying training. The crew first flew together in a Wellington on 5 June, and on the 8th they first flew without an instructor in the plane. After 27 hours of flying time, the crew returned to RAF Chipping Warden. On 24/25 July, Peden's crew flew their first sortie over the Continent. This exercise was a leaflet drop at Montargis, France. By the beginning of August 1943, Peden had flown a total of 449 hours, and just under 84 in Wellingtons. The crew was ordered to report to No. 1657 Heavy Conversion Unit at RAF Stradishall on 5 August. The first two weeks of their time at Stradishall was spent in a ground course learning about the Short Stirling, the plane they would be flying. The crew also acquired an additional two members: flight engineer Bill Bailey and mid-upper gunner Bert Lester. On 22 August Peden first flew the Stirling, and did his first solo flight the next day. His last training flight came on 19 September, at which time he had accumulated 68 hours in the Stirling. Two days later, on 21 September, Peden and his crew were posted to No. 214 (FMS) Squadron, based out of RAF Chedburgh. = Operational tour: September 1943 - September 1944 = alt=Peden and his crew arrived at RAF Chedburgh late in the afternoon of 22 September, ready to begin the operational tour. At the time of his arrival, 214 was flying Short Stirlings. The night of his arrival Peden was assigned to fly as a co-pilot in a bombing raid on Hanover. Peden described his thoughts upon hearing of the target, saying, \\"I felt a tremour. Hanover struck me as a pretty deep penetration for my maiden effort into the fatherland.\\"Peden, A Thousand Shall Fall, 243. Following the sortie he explained his feeling of relief, stating, \\"[w]e had been flying for five hours and 25 minutes, and I had never experienced a sensation of relief quite as intoxicatingly satisfying as what I felt as I climbed out the rear doors and stepped onto the lovely, wonderful, marvelous, fabulous, solid old concrete of that good old dispersal.\\"Peden, A Thousand Shall Fall, 246. The following night Peden flew again as a co-pilot, this time in a raid on Mannheim. On the night of 25/26 September, Peden flew his first operational sortie with his own crew. This sortie was a \\"gardening\\" operation in the Frisians. Again on 2/3 October Peden's crew flew a gardening sortie, this time around Anholt Island. On 3/4 October the crew flew their first major bombing operation with Kassel as the target. The night of 8/9 October saw the crew fly a raid on Bremen. After this sixth sortie, on 15 October Peden and his crew were granted leave. At this time he returned to Glasgow to visit family again. On the morning of 9 November 1943, Peden and crew were transferred to No. 161 Squadron at RAF Tempsford for temporary service. No. 161 Squadron, along with No. 138 Squadron, were highly secretive units working in conjunction with Special Air Service and Special Operations Executive to deliver material to the French Resistance. The day of his arrival at Tempsford, Peden was notified that he would be flying as co-pilot that night. Before the evening's sortie, King George and Queen Elizabeth visited the station to inspect the crews that would fly that night, and later joined them for afternoon tea in the officers' mess. The next night Peden again flew as a co-pilot. After a practice drop at Henlow on 12/13 November, Peden subsequently flew supply drops with his own crew on 15 and 18 November. They later flew in a mining raid on the Le Havre harbour on the night of 22/23 November, and then had an aborted sortie on 11 December. A 214 Squadron Boeing B-17, August 1944 Peden and crew rejoined 214 Squadron, which had been posted to RAF Downham Market, on 13 December, and on the 18th was granted leave. On 4 January 1944 Peden flew a raid on the Bristillerie V-1 launching site in the Pas-de-Calais. This was his 13th operation, and the final one he would fly in a Stirling. After a short repose, on 17 January, 214 Squadron was transferred to RAF Sculthorpe where it would become part of the new No. 100 Group RAF, a radar countermeasures unit. The squadron would now fly the American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, and would be trained on it by members of the United States Army Air Forces. Through February and March the airmen of 214 acclimatized themselves to the B-17, and from 4 to 12 April, Peden's crew flew exercises with the Bomber Development Unit at RAF Newmarket. On the night of 24/25 April, after nearly 15 weeks off operations, Peden flew a sortie on Karlsruhe. In this first sortie as part of 100 Group, the crew undertook its new supporting duty of disrupting VHF communication between German controllers and pilots. The crew flew again on 8/9 May, this time to Haine-Sainte-Pierre. On 16 May 214 Squadron transferred to RAF Oulton, where the officers took their living quarters near Blickling Hall. During their time at Oulton, the men of 214 Squadron met Margaret Lockwood and James Mason, who were filming The Wicked Lady at Blicking Hall. Peden flew next on 19/20 May on a sortie to Le Mans. On the night of 5 June, the night before the Invasion of Normandy, Peden's crew was selected to fly a patrol along the French coast in support of 15 Lancasters that would bomb coastal batteries. Unaware that this was the morning of the Invasion, Peden described what he saw on his return flight to England, saying, ::We left the French coast behind, continuing our descent, and headed back towards England. It was not yet daylight, but the darkness had begun to soften. Suddenly we saw a sight that brought a lump into my throat. A tremendous, awesome aerial armada was passing us in extended formation a mile or two on our left side – not bombers, but C-47s: an airborne army. They were going in. We were coming out. For a long minute I watched them sailing silently onward to their date with destiny.Peden, A Thousand Shall Fall, 372. Peden's most harrowing sortie came on 21/22 August. The target this night was the Nordstern synthetic oil plant at Gelsenkirchen. En route to the target, Peden's B-17 was attacked by cannon fire from a Messerschmitt Me 410, setting on fire the starboard-inner engine, and then was attacked a few minutes later by a Junkers Ju 88. Roughly 10 minutes from the target, Peden reversed course to return to England. After crash landing at RAF Woodbridge, Peden and his crew quickly fled from their plane before it was hit by a Lancaster that had also come in for a crash landing. For their actions returning the plane home that night, Peden, Waters, and Walker all received the Distinguished Flying Cross. Following Gelsenkirchen, Peden's next sortie, which was also his 20th, was to Paris on the night of 14/15 July. Subsequent sorties included Châlons-sur-Marne (22/23 July), Stuttgart (28/29 July), unknown (7/8 August), Overflakkee (13/14 August), Kiel (16/17 August), screening (17/18 August), and Heligoland (25/26 August). Peden's 30th and final sortie was a raid on Königsberg the night of 29/30 August. On 7 September the Wing Commander informed Peden that his tour was finished. = Teaching, homecoming: September 1944 – August 1945 = On 9 September 1944, Peden began his career as an instructor at 1699 Heavy Conversion Unit at RAF Oulton. It was the responsibility of this unit to supply pilots to No. 214 Squadron and No. 223 Squadron. That December he took the six-day Bomber Command Tactics course at RAF Ingham. On 30 May 1945, 22 days after VE Day, Peden and his crew flew once more over Germany to observe the bombing damage. During this trip Peden detoured over Gelsenkirchen, at which time Stan Stanley urinated out the opening in the side of the B-17 onto the Nordstern plant below. On 27 June Peden was transferred to RAF Linton-on-Ouse, where he stayed for six days, after which time he was posted to RAF Dishforth. Around 14 July Peden attended a special investiture ceremony for Canadians held at Buckingham Palace. There the King presented the pilot with his DFC. After another week at Dishforth, Peden took the train to Liverpool and on 22 July embarked for Canada on the HMT Stratheden. The ship arrived in Wolfe's Cove on 31 July, and on 1 August Peden boarded a westbound train. In the early morning of 3 August 1945 Peden arrived at Winnipeg Union Station where he was met by his father.  Post-war  The \\"Peden\\" Tiger Moth at Nanton Following the War Peden entered United College, University of Manitoba, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1948. On 29 April 1949 he married his classmate Jean Douglas Barker (1927-2018), with whom he had three children. In September 1948 Peden entered law school at the University of Manitoba. He graduated Bachelor of Laws in 1952 and was admitted to the Manitoba Bar that same year. Peden's legal career began as a Crown Attorney, Province of Manitoba (1952–55), and subsequently included private practice (1955–57), General Counsel, Greater Winnipeg Transit Commission (1957–60), Corporate Council, Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg (1960–61), Assistant Deputy Minister, Municipal Affairs (1961–64), and Deputy Minister, Public Utilities (1964–68). Peden was made Queen's Counsel in December 1964. In 1968 he became the first Chairman of the Manitoba Securities Commission, a position he held until his retirement in 1988 at age 65. Peden has also served as Director, Atlantic Council of Canada (1981–90), Governor, Manitoba Branch, Canadian Corps of Commissioners (1985–86), Director, Wartime Pilots and Observers Association, and is a life member of the Winnipeg Trap and Skeet Club.Elizabeth Lumley ed., Canadian Who's Who. Volume XXXI, 1996. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1996) p. 965. For many years Peden has been a supporter of the Bomber Command Museum of Canada, located in Nanton, Alberta, near RCAF Station High River. In 2008 the museum acquired de Havilland Tiger Moth 1405 and restored the plane to its wartime appearance. As a tribute to Peden and a token of gratitude for his support, the museum elected to finish the plane in the livery of Tiger Moth 4080, the plane Peden made his first solo flight in on 16 May 1942 at High River. In response to the museum's proposal, Peden responded, \\"This is a tribute I will never forget, I assure you; and I am absolutely delighted that you are inclined to make this gesture. Apart from the great distinction you thus confer on me, your actions, to my mind, mark a deeply satisfying recognition of the wartime service of so many other young men at No. 5 EFTS, High River, and I find that richly rewarding indeed.\\"  Writing  In the mid-1970s Peden took up writing. His first book, Fall of an Arrow, was published in 1978, and was one of the earliest book-length accounts of the development and cancellation of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow project. In the book, Peden argued against the Diefenbaker government's decision to cancel the Arrow project, although he suggested that had the government of the time been Liberal, it too would have likely cancelled the plane. He described the decision as \\"among the most serious mistakes made by a Canadian politician in peacetime, and it was based upon a culpably restricted assessment of some of the most important factors in the situation.\\"Murray Peden, Fall of an Arrow (Stittsville: Canada's Wings, 1978) p. 133. Further, he argued that after the cancellation of the project, rather than scrapping the completed planes, the government should have transferred them to the RCAF for testing and research. This would have been the same course of action taken by the US Air Force after the cancellation of the North American F-107.Peden, Fall of an Arrow, 131. Peden's second book, and the work for which he remains best-known, was the memoir A Thousand Shall Fall: A Pilot in 214, published in 1979. The book recounts the author's military service, from his enlistment in Winnipeg in 1941, through his service with Bomber Command in England, his return home, to post-War reunions with fellow pilots. Peden's account depicts the gamut of wartime experiences, including humorous episodes from leaves, terror while in combat, and the desolation after learning of friends’ deaths. A Thousand Shall Fall received widespread praise. Reviewing the book in 1984, C. P. Stacey, former director of the Canadian Army Historical Section, said: ::[it] is, within the limits of my knowledge, the best book any Canadian has written about his war experiences, and one of the best books about the war that has been written anywhere. […] A Thousand Shall Fall seems to me to have in it the stuff of a genuine Canadian classic. Canadians will be reading it, I hope, many years from now, when most of the 'award-winning' books of our day have passed into oblivion.Stacey, C. P. \\"A Thousand Shall Fall by Murray Peden, and: 242 Squadron: The Canadian Years – Being the Story of the RAF’s ‘all Canadian Fighter Squadron’ by Hugh Halliday (review).\\" The Canadian Historical Review, Volume 64, Number 2, June 1983, pp. 216. In a letter to the author dated 29 November 1979, former Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Arthur Harris wrote: ::I have just finished reading your book – in fact I found it hard to put down. I consider it not only the best and most true-to-life “war” book I’ve read about this War, but the best about all the wars of my lifetime – from the Boer War onwards. [...] at times it made me so sad that I found it hard to retain the moisture within my eyes.Murray Peden, A Thousand Shall Fall: The True Story of a Canadian Bomber Pilot in World War II (Toronto: Stoddart, 2000) Appendix, p. 484. A Thousand Shall Fall was first published by Canada's Wings in 1979, with a second edition in 1982. A new edition was released by Stoddart Publishing in 1988 with a reprint in 2000. In 2002 Stoddart ceased operations. Norman Shannon wrote of the situation, “[w]hen Stoddart Publishers succumbed to financial pressures among other things, history buffs mourned the loss of a classic book on WWII aviation, assuming that the most personal yet comprehensive account of Canadian airmen in WWII would be lost.”Shannon, Norman. “A Thousand Shall Fall… rises again with a new publishing house.” Esprit de Corps, Volume 11 Number 3, p.21. In 2004, however, Dundurn Press acquired the title and released a new printing. The book remain in print today. Peden's final book was Hearken to the Evidence, published in 1983. This final work was a humorous account of his legal career. = Bibliography = * Fall of an Arrow. Stittsville, Ontario: Canada's Wings, 1978. * A Thousand Shall Fall: A Pilot for 214.

Plot The book opens in 1870 on the wild border between Texas and Indian Territory, where 10-year-old girl has been released after four years of captivity. Kiowa raiders had killed her family and taken her hostage. The girl is entrusted to 71-year-old Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, who is ordered to return her to Castroville, Texas, where her aunt and uncle live. Captain Kidd makes his living as a news reader, traveling between towns and charging a dime a head to read aloud from newspapers. Initially, Cpt. Kidd is at a loss as to how to deal with the girl's semi-wild state. She has been captive so long that she would prefer to stay with the Kiowa, and views her return to distant relatives as a kind of second kidnapping. She speaks no English, and one of Cpt. Kidd's early triumphs in their relationship is merely learning her name: Johanna. As they journey south, the Captain continues to read the news when they reach new towns, earning enough to sustain their forward progress. Cpt. Kidd is careful to avoid local stories, particularly about the rivalry between Edmund J. Davis and Andrew Jackson Hamilton because he knows it will only provoke arguments in his audience. Likewise, he is also careful on the road, taking great pains not to call attention to himself or Johanna. In Dallas, Cpt. Kidd is approached after his reading by a man named Almay, who had been following Kidd and Johanna since Wichita Springs. Almay is accompanied by two Caddo men, and he offers to buy Johanna. Knowing that Almay would only brutalize Johanna, Cpt. Kidd sets up a meeting for the next morning, and then flees during the night with Johanna. Almay and his Caddo henchmen eventually catch up with the Captain and Johanna. With Johanna's help, the Captain survives the gun fight, and eventually, they make their way to the suburb of Castroville where her aunt and uncle live. When Cpt. Kidd realizes that the couple are abusing Johanna, he kidnaps her for the last time, and raises her as his own daughter.

It was known as one of England’s prettiest racecourses. The course was designed by journalist and National Hunt fan, Frederick Page, as a left-handed, mainly flat steeplechase course of one and a half miles. It had eight fences, including two ditches and a water jump. There was also a one- mile hurdle course. There was a slight rise on the far side of the course and a run-in of 400 yards. The course was situated at Brook Farm on the Barton Court Estate, near to the village railway station, and was established by Roland Cave-Brown-Cave, a local man who had married the widowed daughter of the estate's owners. He built the nearby hotel, which still exists. The first meeting was held on Thursday 10 May 1900. Meetings were held annually, with the main races being the Herefordshire Open Hunters Steeplechase and Colwall Stewards Hurdle. The Park Hotel, built by Cave-Brown-Cave nearby Cave-Brown- Cave was reputedly not very good in business, and by 1915 the course was in financial trouble. As a result, the estate, including the racecourse, was auctioned off and bought by J. Scott Bowden. Racing continued throughout the First World War, with four meetings a year on Mondays in March, April, May and October. In the 1920s, the course continued to hold minor jump meetings and by the 1930s, it sold annual memberships and two Tote buildings had been built. The course proved popular with day trippers from South Wales, and hosted famous horses including the future Grand National winner Tipperary Tim who won his first race there, and African Sister, who would win the Champion Hurdle. The course also welcomed top riders like Ernie Piggott and Geoffrey Scudamore of the famous racing family. During the Second World War, Bowden sold the land, under threat of compulsory purchase, to military contractors Dowsett McKay. It became a military vehicle park for the duration of the war and afterwards the new owners chose not to continue racing. The final meeting at the course was therefore the one held on Thursday 25 May 1939. This was not the end of all racing at the course, however. Pony racing took place for five days in 1949 and the North Ledbury Hunt held point-to-point meetings there between 1960 and 1963. Nowadays, the area where the racecourse was is arable farmland and there is little visual trace of its existence, except for the concrete base of one of the stands and a short stretch of running rail. One of the Tote buildings is now a lunchroom on a local estate.

In the score program note, she wrote, \\"Aiōn is inspired by the abstract metaphor of being able to move freely in time, of being able to explore time as a place/space that you inhabit rather than experiencing it as a one-directional journey through a single dimension. Disorienting at first, you realize that time extends in all directions simultaneously and that whenever you feel like it, you can access any moment, even simultaneously. As you learn to control the journey, you find that the experience becomes different by taking different perspectives - you can see every moment at once, focus on just some of them, or go there to experience them. You are constantly zooming in and out, both in dimension and perspective. Some moments you want to visit more than others, noticing as you revisit the same moment, how your perception of it changes.\\" The piece has duration of approximately 37 minutes and is cast in three movements: #Morphosis #Transcension #Entropia =Instrumentation= The work is scored for an orchestra consisting of two flutes, alto flute, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, two trombones, tuba, three percussionists, and strings.

As Thorvaldsdóttir's trademark becomings and spacious soundscapes are more about atmosphere than Rite of Spring-like rhythmic intensity, there was a disjunct between the dancing and playing; if anything the stunning video work projected on the birchwood walls of the concert hall, all rocks and water, related more obviously to the music.

While the CDC guideline was intended to inform primary care physicians on new prescription initiation, in many cases it was misapplied beyond this narrow scope and used to inform opioid tapering practices among patients taking long-term prescription opioids for chronic pain. Voluntary patient-centered opioid tapering has shown success with engagement and reduction of moderate and high-dose opioid doses over the course of months. Principles of patient-centered opioid tapering include: patient consent to taper, patient ability to control the pace of the taper, and pause the taper if desired. Recent published national study protocols ascribe to these principles. Some healthcare providers have expressed concern about negative consequences of rapid forced tapering including suicidality. Human Rights Watch has called the negative consequences of forced prescription opioid tapering in chronic pain to be a “human rights issue.\\" In April 2019, the Federal Drug Administration issued a drug safety communication warning against sudden discontinuation of opioid pain medicines and requires label changes to guide prescribers on gradual, individualized tapering. In October 2019, U.S. Health and Human Services published the HHS Guide for Clinicians on the Appropriate Dosage Reduction or Discontinuation of Long-Term Opioid Analgesics. The document calls for a patient-centered approach, cautions against a blanket assumption that less opioids is always best, and provides an implementation guide for opioid tapering for patients for whom reduction is best.  Benefits  Some studies show pain improves with tapering of long terms opioids, though these are generally data from studies conducted in inpatient settings or in intensive and interdisciplinary programs that are largely inaccessible to the vast majority of patients taking opioids. One community-based opioid tapering study reported that on average pain remained constant among a group of patients tapering long-term opioids, but the study was voluntary and those not wishing to taper either did not enroll or dropped out of the study. The authors cautioned against generalizing their findings to patients who do not wish to taper opioids. Authors of a VA review on \\"Benefits and Harms of Long-term Opioid Dose Reduction or Discontinuation in Patients with Chronic Pain\\" recently concluded that: \\"... evidence is inadequate to fully weigh the balance of the benefits and harms of long-term opioid therapy against the benefits and harms of tapering, primarily due to limited information on tapering harms.\\"  Iatrogenic harms  Some healthcare providers have expressed grave concern about iatrogenic consequences from rapid forced tapering, and poor tapering practices, including suicidality and patient suicides. Data suggest that opioid dose variability—either increases or decreases in dose—confers risk for opioid overdose. Retrospective evidence suggests that rapid tapers are associated with increased emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Cautions have been raised for conducting opioid tapering in patients with mental health conditions such as major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as opioid tapering may destabilize these vulnerable patients and expose them to new health risks.

Sudan responded by stating that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties stipulates that a State that is not a party to a treaty is not bound by that treaty’s provisions.

Eritrea, in its speech, touched upon the Eritrean–Ethiopian border conflict. It called Ethiopia's occupation of Eritrean lands illegal, and denounced the United Nation's silence on the issue. Ethiopia responded by stating that Eritrea itself was guilty of occupying the sovereign lands of other states, including occupations in Sudan, Yemen, Djibouti and Ethiopia. The delegation further stated that Ethiopia had been ready to initiate demarcation talks with Eritrea, but that Eritrea had continued to refuse based on their claims that Ethiopia was occupying their land. Finally, it stated that the Ethiopian-Eritrean Boundary Commission had no mandate to transfer territory between the two parties, and that it was up to the parties to reach a final agreement. It claimed that Eritrea was refusing on the pretext that Ethiopia was occupying Eritrean land, and that this refusal allowed Eritrea to create a pretext for further aggression. Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. The UAE, in its speech, demanded the return of the occupied islands of the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa, which were disputed between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. It also asked Member States to urge Iran to engage in the peaceful initiatives of the United Arab Emirates in order to resolve the issue, either by bi-lateral negotiations or by referral to the International Court of Justice. Iran responded by rejecting the UAE's remarks calling them unacceptable claims against Iranian territorial integrity. It further stated that the Islands were eternal parts of Iranian territory, and consequently fell under its sovereignty. Eritrea Eritrea used its Right of Reply to respond to Ethiopia's Right of Reply. It accused that Ethiopia of making several unfounded accusations that contributed nothing to the peace and security of the region. It continued by stating that the Boundary Commission had already demarcated the border and that Ethiopia was in defiance of the Commission's ruling by continuing to occupy Eritrean territory. Finally, it stated that Ethiopia's disdain for international law was the reason that the conflict could not end, and that Ethiopia had to face up to its obligations if it was at all interested in the peace and stability of the region. United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates used its Right of Reply to respond to the Islamic Republic of Iran's Right of Reply. It expressed its regret that Iran had rejected numerous peace initiatives that had attempted to resolve the issue peacefully, while further rejecting Iran's occupation of the islands. Finally, it once again called upon the international community to support the Emirati position to attempt to bring about a comprehensive and just settlement. Cuba Cuba used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Sweden in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. Sweden, in its speech, called upon the international community to uphold human rights as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. One of the rights specifically mentioned was the freedom of expression, and how it must be protected even in the era of information technology. It further touched upon the situation in various countries, including Cuba, and stated that the harassment and jailing of journalists and bloggers had to be stopped. Finally, it called on the international community to addresses the issue of the violation of freedom of expression. Cuba responded by criticizing Sweden by bringing up its own human rights violations. From allowing the Central Intelligence Agency to spy on its own citizens, to the situation of prostitution in Sweden and of the assaults, including sexual abuse, against women and girls. It finished by accusing Sweden of trying to mislead the General Assembly by pointing fingers. Egypt Egypt also used its Right of Reply to respond to the statements made by Sweden.

It rejected the unfounded accusations made by the Sweden, further stating that the Chinese Government had always protected the economic, social and cultural rights of its all of its citizens. It also mentioned some of Sweden's own incidents of human rights violations, calling the situation sombre. Finally, it mentioned Sweden's double standard of accusing other states of human rights violations, when it has not mentioning the human rights situation in its own country. Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran used its Right of Reply to the statements made by both Sweden and Ireland in their General Debate speeches before the Assembly. It stated that Sweden and Ireland were upholding double standards, as they were attacking Iran for its supposed human rights violations, while ignoring their own record of human rights violations. It also stated the two countries should stop abusing the rostrum of United Nations to level politically motivated, distorted and false accusations against others.\\" = 29 September 2010 = Morning Session * – Minister for Foreign Affairs Wilfred Elrington * – Minister of External Affairs S.

Ethiopia, in its speech, stated that, in regards to security in the Horn of Africa region, that Eritrea had played a destructive role since its independence. The delegation further added that it was unfortunate that the Security Council was not taking necessary steps in order to get Eritrea to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1907, accusing Eritrea of being the \\"principal architect of the complicated situation in Somalia\\" through its support of Al-Shabaab. Eritrea responded by accusing Ethiopia of using its speech to divert attention from its refusal to withdraw its troops from southern Eritrean territories, and of its failed attempt to support the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia. The Delegation continued by stating that Ethiopia was using Eritrea as a scapegoat for the problems it had created Somalia. It further pointed out that it was Ethiopia’s campaign in Somalia in 2006 that contributed to the rise of the Al-Shabaab, and not Eritrean support as Ethiopia claimed. Finally, it stated that Ethiopia had created one of the biggest humanitarian crises African had ever seen and that Ethiopia had significantly contributed to the destabilization of the Somalia. Eritrea finished by calling on Ethiopia to end its occupation of Eritrean territories in order to ensure stability in the region. Ethiopia Ethiopia used its Right of Reply to respond to Eritrea's Right of Reply. It reiterated that Eritrea was destabilizing the Horn of Africa, and that their sponsorship of various terrorist groups in the region had played a role. The Delegation further stated that despite Eritrea's role in the destabilization of the region, and the passage of UNSC Resolution 1907, that the international community had failed to take tangible measures to stop Eritrea. Ethiopia then accused the Eritrean regime of waging a campaign to deflect attention from itself by bringing up the border dispute between the two states, and making Eritrea out to be an \\"underdog.\\" Finally, it finished by calling upon the international community to exert more pressure on Eritrea to comply with UNSC Resolution 1907. Pakistan Pakistan used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by India in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. India, in its speech, stated that, Jammu and Kashmir was is an integral part of India, and that it had been the target of Pakistan-sponsored militancy and terrorism. India called upon Pakistan to fulfill its commitment to not to allow territory under its control to be used for terrorism directed against India. India finished by stating that Pakistan could not impart lessons on democracy and human rights to the international community as long as it continued to allow terrorism against India to remain unchecked. Pakistan responded by stating that Jammu and Kashmir is not an integral part of India, but rather, an internationally recognized disputed territory that is still being considered by the United Nations. It also mentioned that the United Nations had adopted more than a dozen resolutions calling for the settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute through a free and fair plebiscite. Pakistan then reminded India that its first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had said in a speech on 2 January 1952 that \\"Kashmir is not the property of either India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people. When Kashmir acceded to India, we made it clear to the leaders of the Kashmiri people that we would ultimately abide by the verdict of their plebiscite.\\" Pakistan stated that India had continued to violate several United Nations resolutions, and failed to fulfill the commitments made by its leaders. Pakistan then stated that India had used their speech to distract the international community from their human rights violations of Kashmiris in Indian-administered Kashmir. It brought up statements by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch which both had called on the Indian authorities to take steps to ensure respect for the right to life of Kashmiri demonstrators, as well as to respect the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. Finally, Pakistan accused India of maligning Pakistan on the issue of terrorism in order to conceal the state terrorism it had been using to stifle Kashmiri voices demanding the right to self-determination. Azerbaijan Azerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Armenia in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. Armenia, in its speech, stated that Azerbaijan was a threat to regional peace and security through its continued denial of the right to self-determination by the people of Nagorno- Karabakh by rejecting the 1991 independence referendum. Armenia continued by accusing Azerbaijan of attempting to cleanse the people of Nagorno-Karabakh from their ancestral home via a brutal war. Azerbaijan was then accused of undermining the peace process by misleading the international community by distorting of the nature of the conflict, by undermining the Minsk Group by rejecting its proposed principles and by rejecting proposals to come to an agreement on the non-use of force or threat of force. Armenia finished by condemning Azerbaijan's destruction of thousands of cultural and religious heritage objects in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Azerbaijan responded by accusing Armenia of outrageous racist ideology, as well as by pointing out its annexationist intentions and unwillingness to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict in accordance with international law. It further accused Armenia of unleashing the war, attacking Azerbaijan, occupying its ancestral territories, carrying out ethnic cleansing and establishing a subordinate separatist entity on captured Azerbaijani territory along ethnic lines. Azerbaijan also called into the question the legitimacy of the 1991 referendum, claiming that it was not recognized by the Security Council and the General Assembly. Finally, it called on Armenia to realize that in order for peace to be achieved, there was no alternative but to put a prompt end to its illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territory. Armenia Armenia used its Right of Reply to respond to Azerbaijan's Right of Reply. It replied by stating that claims of any military expansionism by Armenia made by Azerbaijan were totally misleading; asserting that Armenia had never started any aggression whatsoever. Armenia continued by pinning the full blame of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on Azerbaijan, accusing them of starting a full- scale war against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, thus forcing them to take up arms in order to protect their lives and homes. Finally, it finished by stating that Armenia had fully complied with the various Security Council resolutions concerning the conflict, whereas Azerbaijan had not, and was attempting to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. Republic of Korea The Republic of Korea (ROK) used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. The DPRK, in its speech, stated that, its efforts towards peaceful development were being constantly threatened and undermined. It then commented on the situation regarding the Cheonan incident, and how sabre-rattling and arms build-ups by the United States and the ROK were leading the Korean peninsula to brink of war. It further rejected the findings of the international team that was assembled to investigate the sinking, citing the ROK's refusal to allow a team from the DPRK to investigate the incident for scientific and objective verification. Finally, the DPRK castigated the ROK, accusing them of rejecting reunification efforts by creating tension on the Korean peninsula by waging war exercises with outside forces and by stepping up an atmosphere of war against their fellow countrymen. The ROK responded by stating the findings of the joint investigation group on the sinking of the Cheonanwere the result of a thorough, objective and scientific investigation, and that its findings were endorsed by the international community in a presidential statement adopted by the Security Council on 9 July 2010 which stated that the \\"Security Council underscores the importance of preventing further such attacks or hostilities against the Republic of Korea or in the region.\\" It continued by stating the DPRK's attack constituted a grave violation of the Armistice Agreement and the principles of the United Nations Charter. Finally, it refuted the DPRK's claims that it was a nuclear-weapon state, citing reports of the eighth Non- Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. Eritrea Eritrea used its Right of Reply to respond to Ethiopia's Right of Reply. It stated that the key to resolving the problems between Eritrea and Ethiopia was the withdrawal of Ethiopian soldiers and institutions from Eritrean sovereign territories. It then mentioned that the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission had already delimited and demarcated the border, and that Ethiopia’s dishonoring of the Commission's agreement by refusing to withdrawal its soldiers was irresponsible and shameful. Finally, it reminded the General Assembly that Ethiopia continues to be the only constant factor throughout the political crisis in Somalia, and that Ethiopia’s continued meddling in the affairs of Somalia was dangerous to Somalis and to the rest of the region. India India used its Right of Reply to respond to Pakistan's Right of Reply. India responded by stating that in its speech, Pakistan had made various baseless and false allegations against India. It continued by reminding Pakistan that it should concentrate on addressing the enormous challenges confronting it, such as terrorism, extremism and sectarianism, rather than making unsolicited remarks about the internal affairs of other states in an attempt to divert attention. Finally, it finished by stating that the Indian Constitution guaranteed the fundamental rights of all Indians, including those in Jammu and Kashmir, and that, contrary to claims made by Pakistan, free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir had been regularly held allowing people in the region to exercised their right to franchise in order to elect their representatives. Azerbaijan Azerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to Armenia's Right of Reply. It stated the United Nations should only be resorted to by Member States in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Organization and not misused for political advantage. It then accused Armenia of using the Organization to advocate for a culture of impunity and promote dangerous ideas of racial, ethnic and religious superiority. It further asserted that it considered Armenia's behavior an open challenge to the conflict settlement process and a threat to international and regional peace and security. Finally, it asked for the international communities help to persuade Armenia to cease its destructive policies, respect the generally accepted norms and principles of international law and negotiate in good faith with a view to achieving a durable solution to the conflict. Democratic People’s Republic of Korea The DPRK used its Right of Reply to respond to ROK's Right of Reply. It stated the ROK, in regards to the sinking of the Cheonan incident, was attempting to bring to the attention of the General Assembly an issue which not even the Security Council had prepared an appropriate judgement. It continued by reiterating that the DPRK had nothing to do with the sinking, and that the evidence presented by the ROK in the Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group was not scientifically based or objective, and that it did nothing more but to raise conclusive doubts. It then mentioned that the ROK had rejected its offer to dispatch its own inspection group in order to verify the investigation's results objectively and scientifically, instead insisting that the international community should only accept the ROK's investigation results. It then stated that if the ROK had nothing to hide, then there was no reason for them not to accept the DPRK's inspection group to verify the investigation results, and that as long as the ROK refused to accept the inspection group, suspicion would continue to grow. Finally, it stated that it did not need the ROK, or any country, to recognize or accept the status of the DPRK as a nuclear State, and that their nuclear program was no created in order to intimidate, but rather as a means to deter attacks from the outside. Ethiopia Ethiopia used its Right of Reply to touch upon the situation with Eritrea. It stated that both Ethiopia and Eritrea had expressed their views on the topic, and that they both had been throwing accusations and allegations at each other for almost a decade, to no avail. It continued by talking about the situation in Somalia and called upon members of the Assembly to refer to the outcome of the Summit on Somalia convened by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, which imposed sanction on Eritrea, and not Ethiopia. It then talked about how the African Union and the international community had both sanctioned Eritrea, stating that it would be unlikely that they had got it all wrong and that Eritrea had got it right. With regards to demarcation, Ethiopia stated that the only way forward was through dialogue. Pakistan Pakistan used to Right of Reply to respond to India's Right of Reply. It started by stating that India's arguments regarding elections in Indian- administered Kashmir had been rejected by both the people of the region, as well as by the international community. It then stated that Pakistan did not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and that the Jammu and Kashmir issue was not an internal Indian matter. It continued by stating that due to the fact that Pakistan was a stakeholder in the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, it retained the right to raise this issue in all international forums, saying it would continue to support the people of Jammu and Kashmir morally, politically and diplomatically. Pakistan then continued by stating that despite decades of repression and human rights violations at the hands of Indian forces, the people of Jammu and Kashmir refused to accept any solution other than the exercise of their right to self-determination. It then stated that the issue of Jammu and Kashmir should not be used as a tool of State politics. Finally, it finished by stating that Pakistan remained committed to a peaceful resolution of all issues with India, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Armenia Armenia used to Right of Reply to respond to its situation with Azerbaijan.

India India used to Right of Reply to reject all untenable and unsolicited remarks from Pakistan. Viet Nam Viet Nam used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Sweden in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. Sweden, in its speech, stated that the harassment and jailing of journalists and bloggers in various countries, including Viet Nam, had to stop. It also called upon the international community to address the issue of the violation of freedom of expression in the digital age. Viet Nam responded by stating that it was open to all comments concerning the country, as long as these comments were constructive and well-informed. It continued by stating that Sweden's comments about the jailing and harassment of journalists in Viet Nam, however, were uninformed, misinformed and ungrounded.

Scharr was the first woman in St. Louis to earn her commercial flight license and worked as a flight instructor at Lambert Field. Scharr was recruited in 1942 to join the Women's Axillary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) and later flew planes as a WASP. Scharr was also the first woman to fly a P-39 Bell Aircobra. After World War II, Scharr was commissioned as a major in the Air Force and also worked as a teacher. Adela Riek Scharr  Biography  Scharr was born and raised in St. Louis. She earned her bachelor's degree from Harris Teachers College (now Harris-Stowe State College) in 1929. While she was at college, she began to become interesting in flying. She started teaching in elementary schools in St. Louis after college. In 1934, she earned her master's degree in education from the University of Missouri at Columbia. Scharr started flying in 1935. In 1938, she was working as a flight instructor at Lambert Field, where she met her husband, Harold N. Scharr. The couple married in 1939 and she was forced to quit teaching after she married. In 1940, Scharr became the first woman to earn her commercial license at Lambert Field. After she was forced out of teaching public school, she went on to teach at the Civilian Pilot Training Program at St. Louis University. In 1941, Scharr was part of a \\"Powder Puff Squadron\\" to repel enemy aircraft that people felt might be able to make their way inland. Scharr joined the Women's Axillary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) in 1942. By the time she was invited to join, she had 1,429 of flight time. She worked with Nancy Love and was part of the first squadron sent to Romulus Army Air Base where newly built aircraft were both inspected and refueled. Love put her in charge of WAFS at the Romulus initially, though later, Love removed Scharr from Romulus and Scharr reported to the 2nd Ferrying Group in Wilmington. When the WAFS became the WASP, she continued to fly and ferry military planes. She was asked to join the WASP in 1943 and made up the first group of women who joined. She was the first woman to fly a P-39 Bell Aircobra. Scharr flew the P-39 from Montreal to Los Angeles and had been prepared to fly by watching a short film and reading the instruction booklet for the plane. In 1948, she became an officer of the Ninety-Nines. Scharr received a commission from the Air Force in 1949, where she joined as a major. She also returned to teaching around the same time, after the law forbidding married women from teaching was lifted. In 1961, she flew a C-135 jet for the Air Force to prove that women could fly that type of aircraft. Scharr retired from the Air Force Reserves in August of 1967. She retired from teaching in St. Louis in 1972. Scharr died on March 11, 1998 after a long illness.

It is commonly known by the name Common Fiber Vase because of its circular and overlapping cap. As well, it has also been called the Earthfan fungus. History and taxonomy This fungus was first described by Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart. Habitat and ecology Throughout North America and Europe Thelephora terrestris can be found in soil. It is commonly found in sandy soils under pine trees, on roots and twigs. As this ectomycorrhizal fungi forms a symbiotic relationship with the pinus species, it forms mycorrihizae. It is commonly found in pine forests as well as plant nursery soils world wide. This fungi is known to get water and nutrients from far away and being capable of growing in both low; fertile and high fertile soils. After a disturbance such as a forest fire, will re-establish quickly and is considered stress tolerant, as well it is a dominant mycorrhizal fungus. Outside of the pinus species, it is also capable of forming mycorrizha with other trees such as alder, birch, oak, beech, and poplar. Thelephora terrestris virus 1 (TtV1), which is a mycovirus, can infect this fungi. Growth and morphology Thelephora terrestris is present year round, though is mostly seen July to December. As the fruiting body forms, it starts off lighter in colour then turns to a darker shade of brown as it ages. A stalk may not be present, if there is one, it is usually very short. Sometimes the fungi is grown in large colonies. The shape is described as a fan and can grow up to 6cm wide. It has been described to have a moldy earth like smell. The hyphae of mycorrhizal forms walls that becomes thicker as it ages, while in earlier stages may be spiney. When mating, the hyphae forms clamp connections The spores are purple- brown colour, ellipsoid or angular shape. Physiology The full life cycle can be reproduced and studied in a laboratory, both ectomycorrhizal form and mushroom form. Due to the mycotoxins that the fungi produces, it protects pinus trees from root pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi.

The Icelandic book editions  The first book edition appeared in August 1901, mentioning Valdimar Ásmundsson as \\"translator\\" for the first time. The book was published by Nokkrir Prentarar, which simply means \\"various printers\\" in Icelandic. Nokkrir Prentarar published only one other book, and it is unclear who the actual publishers were; possibly, Ásmundsson himself participated in the enterprise.De Roos researched the backgrounds of Nokkrir Prentarar in an unpublished research dossier, dated 27 September 2014. Part 1 of Makt Myrkranna consist of pages 5–167 (ca. 37,200 words) concerning the visit of Thomas Harker (as Jonathan Harker is renamed here) at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, while Part 2 consists of pages 168-210 (ca. 9,120 words) concerning the rest of of the story. An episode published in Fjallkonan of 13 October 1900, dealing with Harker's fixation on the blonde vampire girl, was omitted from the 1901 book and its subsequent republications, but was included by De Roos in his English translation. In 1950, Makt myrkranna was republished by Bókaútgáfan Högni, Reykjavik, in very narrow print. The text showed small deviations from the 1901 edition.See notes 3, 15, 125, 284, 296 and 334 in the annotated translation by Hans Corneel de Roos, Powers of Darknes (New York: Overlook Press/Abrams, 2017) The third edition was published in October 2011 by Bókafélagið, Reykjavik, based on the Högni edition. Editor was Ásgeir Jónsson, who also wrote an important afterword. The first edition by now is extremely rare; only two dozen copies are known, most of them held by academic and national libraries.  Reception of Makt myrkranna in Iceland  In Iceland, Makt myrkranna received only one contemporary review - and it was negative. in 1906, Benedikt Björnsson (1879-1941) wrote. > Without doubt, for the largest part it is worthless rubbish and sometimes > even worse than worthless, completely devoid of poetry and beauty and far > removed from any psychological truth. \\"Fjallkonan\\" presented various kinds > of garbage, including a long story, \\"Powers of Darkness\\". That story would > have been better left unwritten, and I cannot see that such nonsense has > enriched our literature.From \\"Nokkur orð um bókmentir vorar,\\" in Skírnir, 1 > December 1906: 344 and 346. Translated from the Icelandic by Hans Corneel de > Roos. Quoted from De Roos, Hans Corneel. Introduction to Powers of Darkness. > New York: Overlook, 2017: 21. Björnsson was of a younger generation than Valdimar and feared that the translation of \\"cheap\\" sensational fiction from abroad might replace Iceland's own literary production, including his own. Ásmundsson, on the other hand, promoting the liberalization of trade relations with England, hoped to connect his readers with the newest literary trends from the UK and attract more subscribers to his newspaper Despite the lack of positive reviews, Makt myrkanna became a household name in Iceland after Dracula with Bela Lugosi (1931) had been shown in a Reykjavik cinema in 1932; it became the generic name for a whole series of vampire movies.De Roos, Hans Corneel. Introduction to Powers of Darkness. New York: Overlook, 2017: 22. The Icelandic Nobel Prize Laureate Halldór Laxness (1902-1998) was heavily impressed by the Icelandic edition of Dracula: \\"And do not forget Makt Myrkranna (Bram Stoker) with the famous un-dead Count Dracula in the Carpathians, who was not less popular than today; one of the best pens of the country was engaged to translate the novel: Valdimar Ásmundsson.\\"From Í túninu heima, part I, Reykjavík: Helgafell, 1975: 208. In an excerpt from Og árin líða (1984), published in Lesbók Morgunblaðsins of 7 January 1984: 4-7, Halldór called Makt Myrktranna \\"one of the best Icelandic novels imported from abroad.\\" Translation from the Icelandic by Hans Corneel de Roos. Quoted from De Roos, Hans Corneel. Introduction to Powers of Darkness. New York: Overlook, 2017: 23. Halldór's own novel Kristnihald undir Jökli (1968) was largely based on Makt myrkranna. The buzz around the English translation by de Roos has also sparked new interest in the novel in Iceland. Reception of Makt myrkranna outside of Iceland Makt myrkranna only received international attention in 1986, when literary specialist Richard Dalby published a translation of the foreword to Makt myrkranna (Powers of Darkness), taken from the 1901 book edition by publisher Nokkrir Prentarar.) Dalby believed this book to be the first foreign translation of Bram Stoker's vampire novel, which had been released in London on 26 May 1897. In fact, as pointed out by Prof. Jenő Farkas in 2010, the first translation of Dracula was into Hungarian by the writer and newspaper publisher Jenő Rákosi, who serialized a translation of Dracula in the Budapest newspaper Budapesti Hírlap (79 parts, starting on 1 January 1898), later that year published in book form. Dalby characterised the Icelandic text as a \\"excessively abridged\\" version of the English original, only notable because a new, extended preface by Bram Stoker had been added. Without further examination, this assessment was adopted by most English-speaking Dracula experts, and \\"Stoker's Icelandic foreword,\\" mentioning the crimes by Jack the Ripper, started playing a major role in academic Dracula exegesis. Only In January 2014, the Dutch literary researcher Hans Corneel de Roos unearthed the original text of Makt myrkranna as originally serialized in Fjallkonan (Lady of the Mountain). The serialization started on 13 January 1900 on p. 4, opening with the preface, signed \\"B.S.\\" and dated \\"August 1898.\\" The last installment appeared on 20 March 1901. Fjallkonan (Lady of the Mountains) had been founded in 1884 and since January 1886 was owned by Valdimar Ásmundsson, who also acted as publisher and editor-in-chief. He was married to Bríet Bjarnhéðinsdóttir, who played an important role in the early women's movement in Iceland. She was the publisher and editor-in chief of Kvennablaðið (Women's Magazine) and Barnablaðið (Children's magazine). They had two children, Laufey and Héðinn.Valdimar Ásmundsson was a self-taught man, but he was recognized in Iceland as an expert on the sagas, and praised as the „best pen in the whole of Iceland in the beginning of the twentieth century\\" by later Nobel laureate Halldor Laxness, De Roos discovered that the Icelandic version was no (abridged) translation of Dracula at all, but featured a modified plot. Harker's adventures in Transylvania were described in an extended Part I, in the journal format known from Dracula, while Part II, set in Hungary, Transylvania, Whitby and London, read like a sketch-like cauda, with only 9,100 words. New characters had been added, such as a mute and deaf housekeeper woman, two detectives (Barrington and Tellet), a dark-eyed Countess Ida Varkony, Prince Koromezzo, the ravenous Mme. Saint-Amand, the hunchback violinist Giuseppe Leonardi, Lucy's uncle Morton and Arthur's sister Mary. Harker's host was named \\"Count Drakulitz,\\" who engaged in financing and organizing an international conspiracy aiming at overthrowing Western democracy, and vented Social-Darwinist ideas; he also acted as the high priest of a clan of ape-like followers, sacrificing half-nude girls during gruesome rituals in a secret temple underneath the castle. All in all, the Icelandic text showed to be less sentimental and more to the point than Dracula, with a heightened erotic stance. De Roos announced these findings in February 2014 in Letter of Castle Dracula, before starting to work on a complete translation from Icelandic to English.  Differences between Dracula and Markt myrkranna Already in his first essay of February 2014, de Roos summarized the content of Markt myrkranna and described the main differences with Dracula:All differences quoted from De Roos, \\"Makt myrkranna: Mother Of All Dracula Modifications?\\" (4 Febr. 2014) and his introduction to Powers of Darkness (Febr. 2017). * In Dracula, Harker soon feels repulsed by the Count's \\"brides.\\" In Markt myrkranna, he is continuously attracted to her and disobeys the Count's instructions to meet her secretly at various occasions. This and other elements add to an erotic atmosphere almost absent from Dracula. * In Dracula, the Counts lives alone at his castle. In the Icelandic version, he has a deaf and mute housekeeper woman who cooks and serves Harker's meals, and he has a clan of followers. He also has a family: a father, an uncle, a niece thrice removed, three wives who have died. * In Dracula, the emphasis is on the Count's vampire nature, which forces him to drink the blood of his victims. Apart from a single scene in which Harker cuts himself while shaving, the Count from Markt myrkranna focuses on his elitist political goals; during the sacrificial rituals, he does not drink the blood of the murdered girl. * In Markt myrkranna, it is Mina, together with Harker's employer Hawkins and the detectives Tellet and Barrington, who conducts investigations in Transylvania and visits Castle Dracula. Mina is never attacked by Dracula, and Van Helsing's crew does not travel to Eastern Europe to eliminate the Count. Instead, the story ends while the Count is still in London. *In Dracula, the Carfax house is located in Purfleet, Essex, far away from the London smog - although Stoker originally envisioned the Count to live in Plastow. In Markt myrkranna, Carfax is set in the East of London. * In the Whitby and London sections of Dracula, the Count hardly appears in public; he is an invisible threat lurking in the shadows. In the Nordic versions, the vampire has pleasant chats with Mina and Lucy at the Whitby graveyard, openly visits Lucy when she is sick, and hosts a grand party with international guests at his Carfax estate. * In Dracula, the police never play an active role, while in the Nordic versions, they investigate the death of Lucy and her mother and two detectives join the ranks of Dracula's enemies. In the Swedish variants, the Hungarian Secret Police also play an active role. Despite these significant differences, the Nordic versions are clearly based on Stoker's 1897 narrative and - unlike later movie adaptations - include all of its main characters. The shortened ending and the Count's public appearance as an elegant socialite seem to anticipate the adaptations made for the 1931 Dracula film with Bela Lugosi. Remarkable is that Ásmundsson removed Dracula's favorable mentioning of the Viking berserkers as bloodthirsty warriors, although Makt myrkranna added various elements from the Icelandic sagas.First noted by De Roos in his annotation of Powers of Darkness (2017), note 308. Notes on references to Icelandic sagas added by Ásmundsson can be found throughout his detailed annotation. Likewise, Ásmundsson removed the vampire's power to shape-shift into an animal, even though Dracula's shape-shifting ability came from Icelandic folklore; Stoker had been inspired by The Book of Were-Wolves by Sabine Baring-Gould, who had lived in Iceland for a time. Some of the names are different than in Dracula: Lucy Westenra is renamed \\"Lusía Western,\\" Mina is named \\"Vilma,\\" from her full name \\"Wilhelmina,\\" Jonathan is \\"Tómas,\\" and the Count is named \\"Draculitz\\".In the English translation by De Roos: Lucia, Wilma and Thomas respectively. For the name of the Count, De Roos opted to return to \\"Dracula,\\" like in the 1950 and 2011 Icelandic book editions of Makt myrkranna.  Similarities with Stoker's preparatory notes for Dracula  Already in his first essay on Makt myrkranna, De Roos noted a number of parallels between the Icelandic plot and Stoker's preparatory notes for Dracula. Some of these early ideas, such as an evening party with the Count entering as the last guest, the use of a \\"secret room – coloured like blood,\\" the appearance of a silent housekeeper woman, or the active role of a police inspector, did not appear in the published version of Dracula. If Ásmundsson had not invented such ideas by himself, he only could have learned about them if Stoker had shared his early ideas for the plot with him. In his blog entry of 15 February 2017, Jason Colavito questioned whether these similarities actually evidenced that Stoker provided an early draft as a basis for an Icelandic (read: Swedish) adaptation. x The Icelandic preface The translation of the Icelandic preface by Joel H. Emerson, published by Richard Dalby in 1986 and again in 1993, over the years has caught the attention of several Dracula scholars, especially as it seemed to suggest a link with the Ripper murders.The Icelandic text speaks of \\"Jakob kviðristara,\\" which literally means \\"Jacob the Disemboweller.\\" To translate it this way is not correct, however; Ásmundsson obviously referred to Jack the Ripper.Davison, Carol Margaret: \\"Blood Brothers: Dracula and Jack the Ripper in Bram Stoker's Dracula,\\" in Sucking Through the Century 1897-1997 [sic], Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1997:147-172; In the translation by Joel H. Emerson, the preface reads: > AUTHOR'S PREFACE The reader of this story will very soon understand how the > events outlined in these pages have been gradually drawn together to make a > logical whole. Apart from excising minor details which I considered > unnecessary, I have let the people involved relate their experiences in > their own way; but, for obvious reasons, I have changed the names of the > people and places concerned. In all other respects I leave the manuscript > unaltered, in deference to the wishes of those who have considered it their > duty to present it before the eyes of the public. I am quite convinced that > there is no doubt whatever that the events here described really took place, > however unbelievable and incomprehensible they might appear at first sight. > And I am further convinced that they must always remain to some extent > incomprehensible, although continuing research in psychology and natural > sciences may, in years to come, give logical explanations of such strange > happenings which, at present, neither scientists nor the secret police can > understand. I state again that this mysterious tragedy which is here > described is completely true in all its external respects, though naturally > I have reached a different conclusion on certain points than those involved > in the story. But the events are incontrovertible, and so many people know > of them that they cannot be denied. This series of crimes has not yet passed > from the memory -- a series of crimes which appear to have originated from > the same source, and which at the same time created as much repugnance in > people everywhere as the murders of Jack the Ripper, which came into the > story a little later. Various people's minds will go back to the remarkable > group of foreigners who for many seasons together played a dazzling part in > the life of the aristocracy here in London; and some will remember that one > of them disappeared suddenly without apparent reason, leaving no trace. All > the people who have willingly -- or unwillingly -- played a part in this > remarkable story are known generally and well respected. Both Jonathan > Harker and his wife (who is a woman of character) and Dr. Seward are my > friends and have been so for many years, and I have never doubted that they > were telling the truth; and the highly respected scientist, who appears here > under a pseudonym, will also be too famous all over the educated world for > his real name, which I have not desired to specify, to be hidden from people > -- least of all those who have from experience learnt to value and respect > his genius and accomplishments, though they adhere to his views on life no > more than I. But in our times it ought to be clear to all serious-thinking > men that \\"there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in > your philosophy.\\" London, ____ Street August 1898, B. S A second translation was commissioned by Robert Eighteen-Bisang in 2014 and created by Silvia Sigurdson from Canada. Relating to Jack the Ripper, her text reads: > Many people remember the strange series of crimes that comes into the story > a little later – crimes which, at the time, appeared to be supernatural and > seemed to originate from the same source and cause as much revulsion as the > infamous murders of Jack the Ripper! The Emerson/Dalby rendering suggests that Jack the Ripper will actually play a role in the Icelandic story. And as Makt myrkranna was believed to be an abridged translation of Dracula, some readers started looking for (concealed) appearances of the Ripper in the original text of Dracula, and other links between Bram Stoker and the Whitechapel murders of 1888. De Roos's essay of February 2014 established that Emerson's translation was incorrect: the Icelandic text indicated that the Ripper Murders \\"happened a little later\\", that is, later than \\"[t]his series of crimes [that] has not yet passed from the memory.\\" As the Count in his conversations with Harker later mentions \\"these murdered women, these people found in sacks in the Thames,\\" De Roos suspect that \\"[t]his series of crimes [that] has not yet passed from the memory\\" refers to the unsolved Thames Torso Murders of 1887-89, that started somewhat earlier than the Whitechapel homicide spree. In his introduction to Powers of Darkness (2017), De Roos addressed a number of other errors in the Emerson/Dalby translation. One of the most obvious errors is that he translated Harker's surname, given as \\"Tómas\\" in both the Icelandic preface and the novel itself, with \\"Jonathan.\\" The translation by Sylvia Sigurdson is not correct either, as she translates the relative clause (in Icelandic: \\"sem komu litlu seinna til sögunnar\\") the same way as Emerson did. Moreover, she misplaces it, so that the meaning of the Icelandic sentence is reversed. One of the most obvious \\"liberties\\" in both translations is that Harker's surname, given as \\"Tómas\\" in both the Icelandic preface and the novel itself, is translated as \\"Jonathan.\\" In 2014, the Icelandic book collector John Moore, Dublin, claimed to have made a longhand transcript of Stoker's English original manuscript for the Icelandic preface. Moore purported to have copied it from the 1897 Donaldson typsecript for Dracula in the 1980s, while he visited book collector John K. McLaughlin, California, at that time the owner of the manuscript. When Mclaughlin had the manuscript auctioned at Christie's, New York on 17 April 2002, this alleged preface had disappeared. In his essay \\"Bram Stoker's Original Preface Revealed?\\" De Roos demonstrated that the text presented by Moore was identical with the Sigurdson translation (with only three tiny differences) and thus showed the same translation errors and omissions; it would be impossible that Ásmundsson would have translated the text as presented by Moore to Icelandic and that Sigurdson, more than a century later, would have translated it back, returning the allegedly original English text. Publication of the annotated translation; possible scenarios how Dracula may have come to Iceland The annotated translation of Makt myrkranna by De Roos was published as Powers of Darkness -The Lost Version of Dracula on 7 February 2017, with a preface by Dacre Stoker and an afterword by John Browning. The book attracted international attention; the announcement in Literary Hub was clicked 30,000 times in the first days. It quoted de Roos with the following words: \\"Although Dracula received positive reviews in most newspapers of the day...the original novel can be tedious and meandering....Powers of Darkness, by contrast, is written in a concise, punchy style; each scene adds to the progress of the plot.\\" In his 2014 essay, De Roos had offered different scenarios how Dracula may have come to Iceland. In his book introduction \\"Makt Myrkranna - The Forgotten Book,\\" he discussed these possible scenarios again:The four following scenarios were already contained in De Roos's essay of 4 February 2014. # Ásmundsson could have worked from the 1897 Constable edition, and - with Stoker's permission - could have changed the story of Dracula as he translated it into Icelandic. Stoker then would have provided a matching preface.As De Roos already noticed in his 2014 essay, the preface mentions a series of crimes, that abhorred the public; in Dracula, no such series of crimes is mentioned. The Icelandic preface also mentions the Secret Police, and a group of foreigners that would have played a dazzling role in London's high society: In Dracula, no corresponding scenes can be found. See De Roos, Hans Corneel (4 Febr. 2017). \\"Makt Myrkranna – Mother of All Dracula Modifications?\\": 7ff. # Stoker may have provided an early or alternative draft for Dracula, plus a preface that matched its content. Possibly, this draft would contain passages rejected by Otto Kyllman, Stoker's editor at Constable.Especially, Stoker could have authored a more provocative version of Dracula, considered too risqué for prudish Britain, and had used far-away Iceland to publish it and establish a copyright in it.See De Roos, Hans Corneel (4 February 2017). \\"Makt Myrkranna – Mother of All Dracula Modifications?\\":13, esp. footnote 36. # Alternatively, Stoker could have sent Ásmundsson an early or alternative draft, which the Icelandic editor modified, with or without Stoker's permission.See De Roos, Hans Corneel (4 February 2017). \\"Makt Myrkranna – Mother of All Dracula Modifications?\\":12ff # Ásmundsson, working from a Dracula copy obtained from England, could have created a pirate version, without ever informing Stoker;See De Roos, Hans Corneel (4 February 2017). \\"Makt Myrkranna – Mother of All Dracula Modifications?\\":13. Iceland joined the Berne Convention only in 1947.See De Roos, Introduction to Powers of Darkness: 39, esp. footnote 46.  Newspaper reviews  The dazzling possibility that Stoker might have \\"parked\\" a lost alternative draft of his epochal vampire novel in Iceland, where it survived for more than a century without being noticed by English-speaking readers, sparked a stream of previews, reviews and commentaries. Although most of these comments expressed a positive opinion on De Roos's book, a few also contained misunderstandings. In her article \\"Dracula in Iceland,\\" Frída Ìsberg refers to the blonde vampire girl as \\"Josephine.\\" In fact, in Powers of Darkness, De Roos explains that elements of the girl's life - or rather that of her great- grandmother - seem to be inspired by the biography of Joséphine de Beauharnais.The girl herself, however, remains nameless.See De Roos (7 February 2017) Introduction to Powers of Parkness: 25, and notes 36,89, 129, 132 137 and 141 in his annotation. According to the Count, the girl believes to be identical with her own great-grandmother at shown in the big portrait on the gallery. See Powers of Darkness: 99, and note 129 in the annotation She aptly notes, though, that Seward's patient has been eliminated from the story, and that In Makt myrkranna, Dracula displays strong Nietzschean tendencies as he speaks of his contempt for Christianity for venerating the weak instead of the strong, and declares his intention is make the entire world \\"bow before the strong ones\\". In The Guardian, Colin Fleming noted that in Dracula, Stoker worked in subtle sexual references to serve as metaphors for \\"...deeper, dark concepts: the idea of an antichrist, the blood-sucking serving as a compelling, hellish inversion of communion. Makt Myrkranna, conversely, could have had the subtitle Lust in a Cape\\". The Canadian novelist Michael Melgaard in a review described Makt Myrkranna as being more of a \\"slow burn\\" as Harker takes much time to realize that he is locked up; in Dracula, by contrast, he realizes almost immediately that he is a prisoner: > The extended [Transylvanian] episode is, with respect to the original, a > much more fleshed-out and intense experience. In Dracula, Harker almost > immediately realizes he's been trapped. The renamed Thomas Harker of Powers > of Darkness is slower to grasp the gravity of his situation. Though uneasy, > he finds many excuses for the Count's behaviour – perhaps the Count is > merely an eccentric; perhaps he's worried about theft? This Harker is > perhaps a bit more dimwitted than the other, but his inability to see what's > going on builds a level of tension the original never attains. Rather than > the empty prison of the original, the Castle Dracula of Powers of Darkness > is filled with the undead and other horrors described in grisly detail: a > ruined chapel described in Dracula as having \\"evidently been used as a > graveyard,\\" becomes a room full of half-decomposed bodies and mysterious > occult markings. Harker stumbles around secret passages, weathers attacks > from unknown assailants and is stalked unendingly by Dracula's bride. It's > Castle Dracula in full house-of-horrors form. The Count himself is more > alive, as a character. He brings Harker into a kind of confidence, seemingly > happy to have someone living to talk with. He speaks of love and jealousy > and the choices he made that caused bitterness to overwhelm him. It's an > origin story, of sorts, for the Count, and one that makes him a more > sympathetic character – which makes him all the more frightening. The Swedish connection The most consequential of all comments De Roos received was a message sent by Swedish fantasy fiction specialist Rickard Berghorn, who claimed that Makt myrkranna must be based on an earlier serialization in the Swedish newspaper Dagen (The Day) under the title Mörkrets makter (equally meaning Powers of Darkness), from 10 June 1899 to 7 February 1900.Email from Berghorn to De Roos, 17 February 2017. In an interview with De Roos, Berghorn stated that Mörkrets makter was much longer than the ca. 160,000 words of Stoker's English Dracula, and - unlike Makt myrkranna - upheld the epistolary style known from Dracula throughout the novel. Checking these claims against scans he obtained directly from Stockholm, De Roos established that there must have existed two different Swedish variants.Various emails from De Roos to Berghorn and others, 11–13 March 2017 It soon turned out that the second serialization of Mörkrets makter, in the tabloid Aftonbladets Halfvecko-Upplaga (Evening Paper's Half- Weekly), from 16 August 1899 – 31 March 1900, as first obtained by De Roos, had been shortened to ca. 107,000 words, while dropping the diary style after Part I. Dagen, the sister paper Aftonbladet, and the Aftonbladets Halfvecko- Upplaga were owned by the same publishing company with the same editor, Harald Sohlman;Emails from De Roos to Rickard Berghorn, Dacre Stoker and others, 3 March 2017. Dagen was a daily Stockholm newspaper while Aftonbladets Halfvecko-Upplaga was a tabloid published twice a week for rural areas. Berghorn's message en the ensuing correspondence forced de Roos to change the focus of his research. To the Icelandic journalist Anna Margrét Björnsson, he told: > No one saw it coming. Neither my research colleagues nor my publisher nor my > friend Simone Berni from Italy, who is a specialist for the early > translations of Dracula. For more than a hundred years, Makt Myrkranna, the > Icelandic adaptation of Dracula, has not been known outside of Iceland, > except for the preface apparently authored by Bram Stoker himself. > Evidently, those in Iceland who were familiar with Valdimar Ásmundsson's > modifications, did not recognize their significance for Dracula Studies in > the UK or in the US. And the other way round, English-speaking researchers > never cared to try and read the Icelandic text. I had to learn Icelandic, > only to get to the gist of the matter. Now it turns out that the same has > been happening in Sweden. Several Swedish experts already were familiar with > an early version of Dracula, that has been serialized in the Swedish > newspapers Dagen and Aftonbladet from 10 June 1899 on. But no one ever paid > attention to it, until Rickard Berghorn read about my English translation of > Makt myrkranna and realized that this – still older – Swedish version bore > an identical title. Mörkrets makter, as is the title of the Swedish > serialization, means exactly the same as Makt myrkranna: Powers of Darkness. > That is how he made the link between the Swedish and the Icelandic version. > First he assumed that Makt myrkranna would be a straight translation of the > Swedish publication, but then he found out that the Swedish text is more > complete and contains scenes neither described in Dracula nor in Makt > myrkranna. And the madman Renfield is still in the story, among others.  The anonymous Swedish editor/translator  Directly under the title, both the Dagen and the Halfvecko-Upplaga variants present the story as a \\"novel by Bram Stoker,\\" then explicate that it is a \\"Swedish adaptation by A-e.\\" To understand how Dracula came to Sweden and what role Stoker actually played in the creation of the Swedish variants, identifying \\"A-e\\" is a crucial step. As a \\"first guess,\\" De Roos in his correspondence with Berghorn suggested that \\"A-e\\" might stand for \\"Aftonbladets editor,\\" that is, Harald Sohlman.Email from De Roos to Berghorn, 3 March 2017 Berghorn objected that the Swedish word for \\"editor\\" is redaktör. A few weeks later, De Roos followed up with an interview in Vampirisme.com, in which he proposed Anders Albert Andersson- Edenberg (1834-1913), a senior journalist and drama translator who cooperated with Harald Sohlman within the framework of Publicistklubben, the Swedish Publicists' Association; he frequently used the pseunonym \\"A.-E.\\" During the course of 2017, De Roos published around two dozen similarities between Mörkrets makter and articles Andersson-Edenberg had previously published in Svenska Familj Journalen. In Spring 2018, De Roos summarized his findings on Andersson-Edenberg in the online magazine Vamped.org.  Who wrote Mörkrets makter? The \\"early draft\\" thesis  In his 2014 essay, De Roos was the first to demonstrate the parallels between Makt myrkranna and Stoker's early notes. But the Dutch author also was the first to question whether Makt myrkranna (and thus the Swedish variants from which it turned out to be derived) actually was authored by Stoker. In this 2014 text and in his introduction to the annotated translation, he extensively discussed the chance that Ásmunddson had radically modified Dracula, possibly even without Stoker's consent. But as the Icelandic preface showed traces of a translation from another language, these essays finally supported the idea that at least the preface had been supplied by Stoker, while Ásmundsson may have had a hand in modifying and shortening the narrative. Even after the link with Mörkrets makter had become evident, De Roos writes, the Icelandic prefaces continues to contain some riddles, now regarding the role of the Swedish translator/editor: How could \\"A-e\\" have learned about the Thames Torso Murders, that were hardly mentioned in the Swedish press? Why did \\"A-e\\" single Van Helsing out as a \\"real person,\\" just as Stoker had done in his interview with Jane Stoddart? Why would \\"A-e\\" have used a Hamlet quote - a stage play Stoker knew by heart?De Roos, Hans Corneel, updated introduction \\"Makt Myrkranna—non c'è due senza tre\\" (Makt Myrkranna—A triplet comes seldom alone) in the Italian translation of Powers of Darkness. Milan: Carbonio Editore, 2019:21-56. The annotation was equally updated. Written in April 2017, last updated 9 October 2018. = David Skal's support for the \\"early draft\\" thesis = Echoing De Roos's discovery of parallels between Makt myrkranna and Stoker's early notes, Stoker biographer David J. Skal mentioned that Stoker's notes list the character of a police inspector. As no such police inspector is featured in Dracula, Ásmundsson could have only learned about him from using an early draft of Dracula as his source, Skal claimed. Similarly, he believed the Count's deaf and mute housekeeper to be taken from such a draft. By now, the discovery of the link between Makt myrkranna and Mörkrets makter has rendered Skal's suspicions about Ásmundsson's role obsolete. But as Makt myrkranna was based on the Swedish Halfvecko text, in turn derived from the Dagen serialization, these parallels now apply to all three Nordic variants, and raise the question whether \\"A-e\\" (instead of Ásmundsson) was familiar with Stoker's early ideas for the plot, or even had received an early draft from England. = The relationship with Dracula's Guest = In his analysis of December 2017, Berghorn pointed to the short story Dracula's Guest (published posthumously in 1914), claiming that Dracula's Guest originally was a chapter from Dracula, but was removed from the final draft. Although this theory is disputed, Berghorn adopted the idea that Mörkrets makter was based upon an abandoned early draft of Dracula. Especially, he believed that the mysterious blond vampire girl from Mörkrets makter/Makt myrkranna is based on the Countess Dolingen of Gratz, and on the blonde vampire bride from Dracula. He further argues that the ornate, flowery style of Dracula's Guest, written in 1892, resembles more closely the style of Mörkrets makter than that of Dracula. He concludes that Mörkrets makter was based upon a draft Stoker may have written in the early 1890s. The argument of a \\"flowery style,\\" however, might well apply to the rather verbose Dagen version, but does not fit the shortened Halfvecko-Upplaga variant. = The \\"early draft\\" thesis and chronological arguments = Berghhorn further proposed that \\"A-e\\" modified Stoker's text as he or she translated it, and noted that Stoker picked the names for his main characters already between 1890–92; the same names, with minimal variations, appear in Mörkrets makter. Berghorn also noted that in the account of the black mass and human sacrifice performed by Draculitz in Mörkrets makter, the scene is described as being lit by flames similar to the flickering lights of a cinematograph, the first film projector only invented in 1895 and not used commercially until 1896. On chronological grounds, Berghorn felt that the reference to a cinematograph was added in by \\"A-e\\" rather being based upon an early draft by Stoker from the early 1890s. Along the same lines, he concluded that several topical political references in Mörkrets makter such as the anti- Semitic riots in France caused by the Dreyfus affair; the Franco-Russian alliance, which was signed in 1894; and the 1898 \\"Orlean\\" conspiracy\\" for a royalist coup de etat in France must have been the work of \\"A-e\\". Other elements of Mörkrets makter, according to Berghorn, must have been come from Stoker himself, such as the highly favorable references to William Ewart Gladstone, who was Stoker's political hero. As to how an early draft of Dracula might have ended up in Sweden, Berghorn presented his \\"very strong working hypothesis\\" that the writer Anne Charlotte Leffler and her mathematician brother Gösta Mittag-Leffler, both of whom were friends of the Stoker family, had \\"something to do with it.\\" To further support his theory, Berghorn copied the parallels with Stoker's early notes, as first worded by De Roos, to his own his essay of November 2017, adding a further example regarding Lucy's brooch. = Dracula's connection with the London East End = In his book contribution \\"Dracula and the Psychic World of the East End of London,\\" Clive Bloom noted that the Dracula of Makt myrkranna is more closely associated with the East End of London than he is in Dracula, which he argued was meant to link the Count to Jack the Ripper, and to the East End. In the Victorian era, the East End was a center of poverty, disease and crime, especially prostitution. Given the preexisting popular image of the East End as a place of crime and sexual depravity, the \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders of 1888 with five prostitutes gruesomely murdered caught the public's imagination as a symbol of \\"sexual danger\\" associated with London and above all the East End. Bloom also noted that the popular descriptions of the exotic \\"Oriental\\" Ashkenazi Jewish prostitutes from Eastern Europe, whose \\"voluptuousness\\" and dark looks made them popular with johns on the East End, matched the descriptions of the Count's female followers in both Makt myrkranna and Dracula. Bloom further argued that the description of the eroticism of Lucy after she is turned into a vampire by Dracula in both Dracula and even more so in Makt Myrkranna closely resembled the descriptions of the eroticism of the stereotype of the exotic \\"Oriental\\" Jewish prostitute found in contemporary Victorian accounts. Still unaware of the \\"Swedish connection\\" at the time he wrote his book contribution, Bloom argued that the way in which Makt Myrkranna echoed British fears and fascination with the \\"frontier\\" of the East End supports the \\"early draft\\" theory. In his eyes, it was unlikely that an Icelander like Ásmundsson would have been as interested in the East End as Stoker was.  Newest developments: parts of the Swedish preface plagiarized from the memoirs of a pastor  In May 2018, De Roos set out to create an English and German translation of the Swedish preface, which - unlike the Icelandic preface - continued after the Hamlet quote. He discovered that especially the last part, omitted from Makt myrkranna, was almost literally copied from the memoirs of a Lutheran pastor, Bernhard Wadstörm. This part of his memoirs thad been released in March 1899, three months before the preface to Mörkrets makter appeared in Dagen. Furthermore, De Roos identified various elements in the main text of Mörkrets makter that seemed to be inspired by Wadström's memoirs, such as the appearance of a \\"White Lady\\" and the viewing of a fiery sky from a gallery placed on the top floor. As De Roos deems it highly improbable that Bram Stoker himself would have inserted these elements from a Swedish publication, or would have consented to such a plagiarism, he raises severe doubts whether Bram Stoker ever was aware of the Swedish serializations. Based on this discovery and the similarities with Andersson- Edenberg's articles in Svensk Familj Journalen, he now is open to the possibility that Mörkrets makter was a piracy production, with its own literary qualities. As Mörkrets makter and Makt myrkranna change Lucy's surname from \\"Westenra\\" to \\"Western,\\" just like in the announcements of the first American serialization of Dracula in the newspaper Chicago Inter Ocean (7 May-4 June 1899), in May 2017 De Roos suggested that \\"A-e\\" may have seen the American newspaper text or even may have used it as a source text for creating his/her own adaptation, instead of a copy of the British Constable edition. In a conference presentation in October 2018, De Roos outlined the possible links between the Hungarian, the Swedish and the US newspaper serializations, based on an analysis of growing international press cooperation in the 1890s.De Roos, Hans Corneel.\\"Early Serializations and Translations of Dracula, and the Internationalization Of The Press 1890-1900.

In 2017, Rickard Berghorn's Aleph Bokförlag published the full (Swedish) text. Publication and reception history; the relationship with the Icelandic variant Makt myrkranna As an international discussion about Mörkrets makter only started in Spring 2017, many observations applying to the Swedish version of Dracula were initially made with regard to Makt myrkranna, the Icelandic (shortened) translation of one of the Swedish variants. In 1986, literary specialist Richard Dalby published a translation of the foreword to Makt myrkranna (Powers of Darkness) from the 1901 book edition by Nokkrir Prentarar. He described the Icelandic text as a \\"strongly abridged\\" version of the English original, only notable because a new, extended preface by Bram Stoker had been added. Without further examination, this assessment was adopted by most English-speaking Dracula experts, and \\"Stoker's Icelandic foreword,\\" mentioning the crimes by Jack the Ripper, started playing a major role in academic Dracula exegesis. In January 2014, the Dutch literary researcher Hans Corneel de Roos unearthed the original text of Makt myrkranna as serialized in the Reykjavik newspaper Fjallkonan, from 13 January 1900 on. Fjallkonan was published and edited by Valdimar Ásmundsson, who was mentioned as \\"translator\\" in the 1901 book edition. De Roos discovered that the Icelandic version was no (abridged) translation of Dracula at all, but featured a modified plot. Harker's adventures in Transylvania were described in an extended Part I, in the journal format known from Dracula, while Part II, set in Whitby and London, read like a sketch-like cauda, with only 9,100 words. New characters had been added, such as a mute and deaf housekeeper woman, two detectives (Barrington and Tellet), a dark-eyed Countess Ida Varkony, Prince Koromezzo, the ravenous Mme. Saint-Amand, the hunchback violinist Giuseppe Leonardi, Lucy's uncle Morton and Arthur's sister Mary. Harker's host was named \\"Count Drakulitz,\\" who was financing and organizing an international conspiracy aiming at overthrowing Western democracy and vented Social-Darwinist ideas; he also acted as the high priest of a clan of ape-like followers, sacrificing half-nude girls during gruesome rituals in a secret temple underneath the castle. All in all, the Icelandic text showed to be less sentimental and more eritically charged than Dracula. De Roos announced these findings in February 2014 in Letter of Castle Dracula; his complete annotated translation was published on 7 February 2017. The book attracted international attention, and ten days later, De Roos was contacted by Swedish fantasy fiction specialist Rickard Berghorn, who claimed that Makt myrkranna must be based on an earlier serialization in the Swedish newspaper Dagen (The Day) under the title Mörkrets makter (equally meaning Powers of Darkness), from 10 June 1899 to 7 February 1900.Email from Berghorn to De Roos, 17 February 2017. In his interview with De Roos, Berghorn stated that Mörkrets makter was much longer than the ca. 160,000 words of Stoker's English Dracula, and - unlike Makt myrkranna - upheld the epistolary style known from Dracula throughout the novel. Checking these claims against scans he obtained directly from Stockholm, De Roos established that there must have existed two different Swedish variants.Various emails from De Roos to Berghorn and others, 11-13 March 2017 It soon turned out that the second serialization of Mörkrets makter, in the tabloid Aftonbladets Halfvecko-Upplaga (Evening Paper's Half- Weekly), from 16 August 1899 – 31 March 1900, as first obtained by De Roos, had been shortened to ca. 107,000 words, while dropping the diary style after Part I. Dagen, the sister paper Aftonbladet, and the Aftonbladets Halfvecko- Upplaga were owned by the same publishing company with the same editor, Harald Sohlman;Emails from De Roos to Rickard Berghorn, Dacre Stoker and others, 3 March 2017. Dagen was a daily Stockholm newspaper while Aftonbladets Halfvecko-Upplaga was a tabloid published twice a week for rural areas. As the structure of the Icelandic version corresponded to that of the abridged Halfvecko-Upplaga variant (same chapter titles, only two parts, no epistolary format in Part II), De Roos concluded that Ásmundsson must have used the latter as his source text, replacing various cultural references with hints to Icelandic sagas, and shortening the text even further, to ca. 47,000 words. Berghorn claims that the extended Dagen version was no success and that as a result, the Halfvecko-Upplaga version was cut short after the Transylvan part; Editor-in-chief Harald Sohlman may have wanted the space in the newspaper set aside for other, hopefully more profitable serializations; the plans to turn the serialization into a book were shelved. Only in 1916, the Dagen variant was reprinted in the Swedish magazine Tip-Top (no. 40-52 1916, no. 1-52 1917, no. 1-4 1918). After that, it was largely forgotten. During a lecture in 1997, Icelandic literary scholar Guðni Elísson discussed the possibility that Makt myrkranna had been derived from a Scandinavian source. But as this idea was never published, and Swedish experts familiar with Mörkrets makter failed to bring the Swedish version of Dracula to the attention of an international audience, it was only the English translation of Makt myrkranna that triggered an interest in Mörkrets makter outside Sweden. References to London's East End In his book contribution \\"Dracula and the Psychic World of the East End of London,\\" Clive Bloom noted that the Dracula of Makt myrkranna is more closely associated with the East End of London than he is in Dracula, which he argued was meant to link the Count to Jack the Ripper, and to the East End. In the Victorian era, the East End was a center of poverty, disease and crime, especially prostitution. There were about 80,000 prostitutes working in the East End. Child prostitution was especially common with girls as young as ten working as prostitutes. The 1885 article \\"Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\\" by W.T. Stead about child prostitution in London had an enormous impact on public opinion at the time with over a million and half unauthorised copies of the article circulating. Stead's article with its account of \\"gentlemen\\" buying underage prostitutes popularised the image of the sexually predatory upper class male. Given the preexisting popular image of the East End as a place of crime and sexual depravity, the \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders of 1888 with five prostitutes gruesomely murdered caught the public's imagination as a symbol of \\"sexual danger\\" associated with London and above all the East End. Bloom also noted that the popular descriptions of the exotic \\"Oriental\\" Ashkenazi Jewish prostitutes from Eastern Europe, whose \\"voluptuousness\\" and dark looks made them popular with johns on the East End, matched the descriptions of the Count's female followers in both Makt myrkranna and Dracula. Bloom further argued that the description of the eroticism of Lucy after she is turned into a vampire by Dracula in both Dracula and even more so in Makt Myrkranna closely resembled the descriptions of the eroticism of the stereotype of the exotic \\"Oriental\\" Jewish prostitute found in contemporary Victorian accounts. The Swedish Count Draculitz as a Social Darwinist Already in his 2014 essay, De Roos noted that in Makt myrkranna, the Count strongly expressed elitist and Social-Darwinist opinions. While discussing his family portraits at the gallery with Harker, he explains how the strong have the right to rule over the weaker and exploit them. In his analysis of November 2017, Berghorn elaborates on this observation, explaining that the völkisch movement had emerged as a major force in Germany by the 1890s and already some of the völkisch leaders were advocating killing the mentally and physically disabled as their very existence threatened the purity of the Herrenvolk (\\"master race\\"). Putting such Social Darwinist and racist language into the mouth of Count Dracula was a way of caricaturing the popularity of Social Darwinism with elites in both Europe and the United States in the 1890s. Before he goes insane, Dr. Seward thinks after reading a newspaper about the state of the world: > \\"By the way, the telegram section of the newspaper announces several strange > news – lunatic behavior and deadly riots, organized by anti-Semites, in both > Russia and Galicia as well as southern France – plundered stores, slain > people – general insecurity of life and property – and the most fabulous > tall tales about \\"ritual murders,\\" abducted children and other unspeakable > crimes, all of which is ascribed in earnestness to the poor Jews, while > influential newspapers are instigating an all-encompassing extermination war > against the \\"Israelites.\\" You would think this is in the midst of the Dark > Ages!...Now, once again, it seems that a so-called \\"Orlean\\" conspiracy is > tracked down – while at the same time the free Republicans in France are > celebrating with exaltation the exponent of slavery and despotism in the > East...It is a strange time in which we live, that is sure and true.--- > Sometimes it seems to me as if all the insane fantasies, all the crazy > ideas, the whole world of crazed and scattered notions, into which I, as a > madhouse doctor, for years have been forced to enter in the care of my poor > patients, now begin to take shape and form and gain practice in the course > of the world's major events and tendency\\". Passages such as this, Berghorn believes, reflect the widespread mood of pessimism in fin de siècle Europe as the 19th century closed and the 20th century began, as many in Europe believed that civilization was rotten to the core, and all that was left for European civilization now was the apocalypse. The anonymous Swedish editor/translator Directly under the title, both the Dagen and the Halfvecko-Upplaga variants present the story as a \\"novel by Bram Stoker,\\" then explicate that it is a \\"Swedish adaptation by A-e.\\" To understand how Dracula came to Sweden and what role Stoker actually played in the creation of the Swedish variants, identifying \\"A-e\\" is a crucial step. As a \\"first guess,\\" De Roos in his correspondence with Berghorn suggested that \\"A-e\\" might stand for \\"Aftonbladets editor,\\" that is, Harald Sohlman.Email from De Roos to Berghorn, 3 March 2017 Berghorn objected that the Swedish word for \\"editor\\" is redaktör. A few weeks later, De Roos followed up with an interview in Vampirisme.com, in which he proposed Anders Albert Andersson- Edenberg (1834-1913), a senior journalist and drama translator. In 1870, Andersson-Edenberg had been one of the co-founders of Publicistklubben, the Swedish Publicists' Association, in which also Sohlman was an active member. Both were involved in the organization of the Fourth International Press Congress in Stockholm in June 1897, and both contributed to a publication celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Association in May 1899, just one month before the serialization of Mörkrets makter started in Dagen. De Roos suspects that Andersson-Edenberg also had known Harald's father, August Sohlman, who had died during a tragic sailing accident in 1874. For a translation of the play Mellan drabbningarne by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson (1832-1910), the Norwegian author who won the 1903 Nobel Prize Winner in Literature, Andersson-Edenberg used the pseudonym “A.E.” For numerous articles in the monthly magazine Svenska Familj-Journalen, he frequently used the pseunonym \\"A.-E.\\" During the course of 2017, De Roos published around two dozen similarities between Mörkrets makter and articles Andersson-Edenberg had previously published in Svenska Familj Journalen. In Spring 2018, De Roos summarized his findings on Andersson-Edenberg in the online magazine Vamped.org. Who wrote Mörkrets makter? Already in February 2014, De Roos addressed the question to what extent the Icelandic preface and narrative were actually written by Bram Stoker himself, or modified by Ásmundsson, or even completely created by the latter. These questions still remain, now with regard to the Swedish publications: we do not know for sure to what extent Stoker authored and provided the Swedish versions himself, to what extent the Swedish editor changed the story, or even authored it completely, losely based on the English book. In his analysis of December 2017, Berghorn points to the short story Dracula's Guest (published posthumously in 1914), claiming that Dracula's Guest originally was a chapter from Dracula, but was removed from the final draft. Although this theory is disputed, Berghorn maintains hat Mörkrets makter was based upon an abandoned early draft of Dracula. Especially, he believes that the mysterious blond vampire girl from Mörkrets makter/Makt myrkranna is based on the Countess Dolingen of Gratz, and on the blonde vampire bride from Dracula. He further argues that the ornate, flowery style of Dracula's Guest, written in 1892, resembles more closely the style of Mörkrets makter than that of Dracula. He concludes that Mörkrets makter was based upon a draft Stoker may have written in the early 1890s, and sent to Sweden The argument of a \\"flowery style,\\" however, might well apply to the rather verbose Dagen version, but does not fit the shortened Halfvecko-Upplaga variant. Berghhorn further proposes that \\"A-e\\" modified Stoker's text as he or she translated it, and notes that Stoker picked the names for his main characters already between 1890–92; the same names, with minimal variations, appear in Mörkrets makter. Berghorn also notes that in the account of the black mass and human sacrifice performed by Draculitz in Mörkrets makter, the scene is described as being lit by flames similar to the flickering lights of a cinematograph, the first film projector only invented in 1895 and not used commercially until 1896.

Other elements of Mörkrets makter, according to Berghorn, must have been come from Stoker himself, such as the highly favorable references to William Ewart Gladstone, who was Stoker's political hero. As to how an early draft of Dracula might have ended up in Sweden, Berghorn presents his \\"very strong working hypothesis\\" that the writer Anne Charlotte Leffler and her mathematician brother Gösta Mittag-Leffler, both of whom were friends of the Stoker family, had \\"something to do with it\\". As further support for his thesis, Berghorn mention several similarities between the Swedish plot and Stoker's preparatory notes for Dracula, already discussed by De Roos in 2014, and criticized by Jason Colavita. Still unaware of the \\"Swedish connection\\" at the time he wrote his book contribution, Clive Bloom argued that the way in which Makt Myrkranna echoed British fears and fascination with the \\"frontier\\" of the East End supports the \\"first draft theory.\\" In his eyes, it was unlikely that an Icelander like Ásmundsson would have been as interested in the East End as Stoker was.

Keynote presentation at the Children of The Night International Dracula Conference, Brașov, Romania, October 2018.  Upcoming English translation of the Dagen serialization; Drafts of Dracula  In a post of 22 December 2019 on his Weird Webzine Facebook page, Rickard Berghorn announced that an English translation of the (longer) Dagen serialization is upcoming and has been accepted by a well-known publishing house. According to information supplied by Swedish literature scholar Martin Andersson, Berghorn will address anglicisms in passages that did not appear in Stoker's Dracula, thus suggesting that an (other) English text must have been the basis of the Swedish version. In Drafts of Dracula, Robert Eighteen-Bisang and Elizabeth Miller also refer to this planned translation. Moreover, they point to the parallels between Stoker's notes and the Nordic versions, as originally discovered by De Roos, and state: \\"The appearance of three events from the “Historiae Personae” on page eight of the Notes defies coincidence. However, there is no proof - such as the use of the name “Cotford” or any of seven characters who are named before they disappear from the Notes, or having Morris come to rescue with a maxim gun - that the author of the Swedish text had any contact with Bram Stoker.\\" The debate on the origins of Mörkrets makter continues.

The forests are special habitats that are likely to be home to rare species, including some that are unknown at present. The first 26 exceptional forests were granted that status in 2002. As of 2018 there were 256 territories with that classification. They are all on public land, since the Ministry has no legal tools to enforce protection of forests on private lands. Types of exceptional forest ecosystem Forêt rare de la Montagne-à-Fourneau The Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife groups exceptional forest ecosystems into three categories: old-growth forests, refuge forests and rare forest ecosystems. As of 2001 more than 600 EFE sites had been identified south of the 52nd parallel, covering almost . Old growth forests have not experienced any major anthropogenic disturbance. The dominant trees in the canopy have reached a very advanced stage of maturity, which is unusual in southern Quebec. The forests hold a mixture of young, mature and senescent trees, and debris on the forest floor includes the decaying remains of large trees. These forests are examples of natural forest ecosystems, and contain exceptional and sometimes unique flora. The study of the natural dynamics of these forests can help improve forestry practices that rely on natural development of stands of trees. Refuge forests are home to significant numbers of plant species that are or may be designated as threatened or vulnerable, including a species of extreme rarity (e.g. known to be found in less than five places in Quebec) or a forest with a remarkable population of threatened or vulnerable species. Candidates for refuge forest status are assessed through a detailed review of information held by the Quebec Ministry of the Environment on the location of species, importance of populations, nature of their habitats and their provincial priority rank on the ministry's official list of species. This type of ecosystem is found mainly in southern Quebec. Threatened or vulnerable species are mainly at risk from habitat loss. Preservation of the refuge forests is essential to their survival, and to preserving biodiversity. The Nature Conservancy (1988) suggests a forest may be considered rare based on two different viewpoints. One is that it has an unusual composition of species or structure of forest cover, which may be threatened by human activities. An example could be mixed northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and white oak (Quercus alba). There are only a few small forests of this type recognized in Quebec. The other type of rare forest is composed of flora that would not normally be found in its bioclimatic subdomain. These are mainly isolated ecosystems in an unusual subdomain in the north. Administration The steps for classifying a forest ecosystem as exceptional include presentation of a proposal, scientific validation, temporary protection, consultation within the ministry, with municipalities, aboriginal communities and rights holders, followed by the ministerial decision. The process may take several years. In the interim, the Forest Sector and Forest Quebec provide administrative protection. Once a forest ecosystem has been classified as exceptional forest ecosystems under section 24.4 of the Forest Act it is under the administrative responsibility of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife of Quebec. Some activities may be authorized in such forests, including research, education, recreation and tourism, and work related to mining rights. Other rights may be maintained after a forest has been designated exceptional, but special permissions must be obtained.

His humble beginnings among the streets and masses have been attributed to his success and relevance in the local politics of Makati City. He is an avid motorcycle rider and the founder of a community-based group named \\"Tropang Kid\\". Since its formation in 1994, the riding club has established itself as a growing organization in Makati City composed of volunteers who travel around in motorbikes as companions of the District Representative and as social service carriers. He graduated from Adamson University with the degree of Political Science.  Political career  In the 2019 Philippine Midterm Elections, Peña won against former Philippine Vice-President Jejomar C. Binay in a close race for a Congressional seat in the 1st District of Makati City, a locality where several Binay family members have served as mayors since 1986. He started his career in politics when he volunteered as a youth leader before being elected as Chairman of Barangay Valenzuela, Makati City. He later became President of the Association of Barangay Captains (ABC) and City Councilor from 2008 to 2010. In the May 2010 elections, he was elected as vice-mayor where he ran as an independent candidate. He was re-elected in 2013 under the Liberal Party (LP). Peña was sworn in as acting mayor of Makati City at the old city hall building after the Office of the Ombudsman suspended Mayor Jejomar Erwin \\"Junjun\\" Binay Jr. and 14 individuals over irregularities on building contracts. He became the first city mayor of Makati who not affliated with the Binay family since 1986 and its cityhood in 1995.

The mountains are in Morogoro region, east of Tanzania's capital Dodoma. The mountains are named for the Kaguru people. The Ukaguru Mountains are part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, and are home to a biodiverse community of flora and fauna with large numbers of endemic species. Geography The Ukaguru Mountains are plateau, covering an area of 1258.8 km².N. D. Burgess et al. (2007). \\"The biological importance of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and Kenya\\".

The Nguru Mountains lie to the northeast. The Kiboriani Mountains, a western outlier of the Ukagurus, and East African Plateau lie to the west. Climate The Ukaguru Mountains lie in the rain shadow of the taller Uluguru Mountains to the southeast, which block the moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean which provide most of the rainfall in the Eastern Arc Mountains.BirdLife International (2019) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Ukaguru Mountains.

Most of the rainfall occurs in the November-to-May wet season, although mist and light rain occur at higher elevations during the dry season months. Rainfall is higher on the southern and eastern slopes, and lower in the mountains' rain shadow to the north and west. Temperatures are cooler and rainfall is higher at higher elevations.\\"Eastern Arc forests\\". World Wildlife Fund ecoregion profile. Accessed 10 September 2019. Geology The Ukaguru Mountains, along with the others in the Eastern Arc, are made up of ancient crystalline Precambrian rocks that were uplifted over millions of years along fault lines. The most recent period of uplift started 30 million years ago, but the fault system and uplift process may be far older. Soils derived from these ancient rocks are not as fertile as the younger volcanic soils of mountains to the north and west.\\"Eastern Arc forests\\". World Wildlife Fund ecoregion profile. Accessed 10 September 2019. Flora and fauna About thirty million years ago, the area was covered by extensive rainforest. During a cooler and drier period some ten million years ago, the lowland forests were converted to savanna, leaving the mountain ranges as \\"islands\\" where the tropical forests continued to flourish. The long-term persistence of a humid climate and the isolation of each mountain range has led to a great deal of endemism, and a very diverse flora and fauna. The Ukaguru and other Eastern Arc mountains have extremely high biodiversity with numerous endemic species (more than 25 percent of the vertebrate species).Newmark, W. D., 2002, Conserving Biodiversity in East African Forests, a Study of the Eastern Arc Mountains. Ecological Studies 155.

At the bottom, devils and witches. Above, women and children are being interrogated and are given testimony. A prisoner drives a flock of imprisoned witches and wizards. Around the bonfire where the convicted burn, witches are seen carrying children on brooms, goats and debris, while demons in animal debris tumble into the air.German copper engraving from 1670. Sweden was a country with few witch trials compared to other countries in Europe. In Sweden, hundreds of people were executed for witchcraft between 1492 and 1704. Most of these cases (circa 280) occurred during a short but intense period; the eight years between 1668 and 1676, when the witch hysteria called \\"The Great Noise\\" took place, causing a large number of witch trials in the country. It is this infamous period of intensive witch hunt that is most well-known and explored and given attention.  The first wave: Swedish witch trials before 1668  In the Middle Ages, sorcery was not considered a serious crime. Sorcery was criminalized in Sweden–Finland in the County Law of 1350, which stated death penalty for sorcery only if it had been combined with murder (maleficium),Ankarloo, Bengt & Henningsen, Gustav (ed.), Skrifter. Bd 13, Häxornas Europa 1400-1700: historiska och antropologiska studier. Stockholm: Nerenius & Santérus, 1987 but there are no confirmed case of anyone who was actually executed for sorcery in Sweden during the Middle Ages. There are a few sorcery cases where the outcome is unknown (but was probably fines), such as a case from Arboga city's notebook in 1471, when Karin and Birgitta Andersdotter were accused of witchcraft. Another one, the case of Eric Clauesson from 1492, who was executed for consorting with the Pagan god Odin (viewed by the Christian church as a demon), could be categorized as a witch trial, but also as a heresy trial. This law was valid until 1608. =Until 1608= In the 16th-century, the law was beginning to be interpreted more strictly. During the period from the Swedish Reformation in 1527 to 1596, there were about 100 witch trials in Sweden, which may have resulted in ten deaths in total. These trials mainly took place in Småland and Götaland. In 1550, Lasses Birgitta of Öland became the first woman in Sweden confirmed to have been executed for witchcraft. In 1551, king Gustav Vasa ordered those suspected of the murder of his secretary Clemens Hansson by use of poison and sorcery to be arrested, prosecuted, imprisoned and tortured, but it appears his demands were not met. One of these women was offered by the court to swear herself free by a so-called tolvmannaed (literary:\\"Twelve Ment's Oath'). However, the trial did not take place until 1563, when Hansson's heirs brought it to the king's high council. The woman was then offered to go through the previously proposed oath, with the condition that if she could not, she would be sentenced as guilty, this meant she would be sentenced to pay fines \\"by Sweden's law\\". In 1571, the priests of the country were ordered to pay attention to all signs of witchcraft in the communities, and the following year a provision was introduced to exclude those who engaged in witchcraft from the congregation. Several such cases are said to take place in Värmland during this time. In 1575, two women were executed in Fryksdalen, and later in 1607-1610 a series of additional cases were brought up, which was submitted to King Charles IX of Sweden, where torture occurred in several of them. Bishop Abraham Angermannus' visitation journey through the country in 1596–97, in effect the final stage of the Reformation, intended to root out anything not in accordance with Protestant practices, resulted in a wave of about 140 witch trials, especially in Götaland; however, they rarely led to the death penalty but rather to fines, pillorying, whippings and other disciplinarian punishments. In 1597, three women in Hälsingland were accused of flying over \\"mountains and valleys\\" to Blåkulla where they had intercourse with Satan, which were among the earliest cases were women in Sweden were accused of having attended a witches' Sabbath. Notable cases were those with Brita Pipare and Geske in the capital of Stockholm, which also included descriptions of witchcraft of the kind it was by then becoming the modern one on the continent. However, the old Swedish sorcery law was not made to deal with witchcraft cases in the manner they were performed in the nearby Germany, and death sentences could not be issued in these cases because the law did not allow for death penalty for consorting with the Devil, which illustrate the difficulty for authorities to deal with this new phenomenon. King Charles IX however, being a Protestant reformer with knowledge of the words of the Bible, where sorcery was condemned by death, was personally in favor of being strict toward sorcery. In 1607, Charles IX condemned a woman to be burned after she was accused of sucking all the power and blood of her son through a magician. The magician was also prosecuted on orders from the king, but there are no known documents to prove how he was prosecuted. It is also the only known accusation of vampirism in the Swedish witch processes. =1608-1668= In 1608, Sweden was given a modern Witchcraft Act. It replaced the old law, were sorcery was only punishable if combined with murder, and introduced the death penalty for all forms of sorcery, based on the Bible's writings: \\"Thou shalt not let a sorceress live.\\" This law was the beginning of the real witch hunt in Sweden, and the period of the 1610s did see the first Swedish witch hunt. In 1611, a woman called Karin of Öckleqvarna was subjected to the water test, by royal command, the result of her prosecution is however lost. The same year, the famous case of Elin i Horsnäs took place, in which the deadly outcome was likely affected by the new laws, as she had been accused but acquitted before. During the 1610s, the first real witch hunt in Sweden resulting in death sentences took place in the Duchy of Östergötland on the order of Princess Maria Elizabeth of Sweden.Ankarloo, Bengt, Satans raseri: en sannfärdig berättelse om det stora häxoväsendet i Sverige och omgivande länder, Ordfront, Stockholm, 2007 Lussi from Svarttorp in Hällestad confessed that she had attended the Witche's Sabbath in Blåkulla and had sex with Satan, and seven women were executed in the Finspång witch trial of 1617. There were likely several more who were accused and convicted during the witch hunt of the 1610s, but the number of cases and executions are badly documented as most of the contemporary documentation has been lost. In 1619, two \\"witches\\" were imprisoned in Gävle for having intercourse with Satan in Blåkulla. Other lesser-known early trials where several were convicted at the same time, including those in Ramsele 1634, Norrköping 1617, northern Värmland 1603–07 and Vassunda 1603. Because of the large number of accused people in northern Värmland, it seems to have come close to the same amount of trials as in Östergötland, but because the court ruling is lacking, the consequences of these trials are basically unknown. However in a preserved document, it is stated that a man named Mats in Olaby was sentenced according to the law of Uppland and Västerås to be burned. In 1633, \\"Olof Fets' wife\\" was sentenced to be beheaded and burned in Örebro by Svea Court of Appeal because she confessed that she had been in Blåkulla once and had intercourse with Satan. The first wave of trials in Sweden, which occurred between 1590s and the 1610s (which was also the most intensive time period in Europe), stopped in the 1620s, and for the following forty years, death penalty for witchcraft was a rare sentence in Sweden. These first witch-trials were few compared to the large hysteria that would come to be in the 1660s- and 70s. In 1635 the parliament, whose task it was to confirm the death sentences handed down by the local courts, expressed a relief that there had been very few cases of witch trials reported to them for a period of several years past. While the witch trials became more common in Sweden in the first half of the 17th-century, they seldom resulted in death sentences. Prior to 1668, the most common outcome for someone accused for sorcery in Sweden was for the accused to be released or given a penalty other than death penalty. For example, out of the 14 people (3 men and 11 women) who were charged for sorcery (3 for witchcraft, 7 for harming humans or animals) in the province of Dalarna during 1631-1667, the wast majority received a mild punishment such as banishment or fines. 16 witchcraft trials (5 against men, 11 against women), were held in 1630–1671 according to Frykdal's books of upper district law, most of whom did not result in a death penalty. Indeed, the most serious trial in Dalarna before 1668 is considered to be the case of Håll Karin in 1663, which resulted in banishment from the area instead of death penalty. Witch trials hardly occurred during Queen Christina's reign. In 1648 the high profiled case of Olof Månsson was commuted from a death sentence to a disciplinarian punishment. In the winter of 1649 the queen ordered the witch trial in the Swedish province of Bremen-Verden in Germany be stopped so it wouldn't develop into a mass trial. However, while rare, the death penalty did occur in witchcraft trials during this time. In 1650, two old women from Umeå had admitted that they had traveled to Blåkulla and used magic tricks to milk other cows and were sentenced to death according to the1608 law. When the High Court, which gave the sentence for decapitation and later being burned at a bonfire, referred the case to Christina, she approved the death sentence. In 1653, a woman from Lit in Jämtland was also sentenced to death for killing cattle with magic. It is considered the last death sentence for witchcraft in Sweden before 1668. Between 1596 and 1668, a little under a hundred executions for witchcraft are estimated to have occurred in Sweden.  The \\"Great noise\\" of 1668–1676  The largest and most famous Swedish witch hunt took off in 1668 during the reign of Charles XI, when the hysteria called Det stora oväsendet (literary: \\"the Great Noise\\") resulted in almost three hundred executions (more than any period prior), during the eight years until 1676, when they were stopped. They took place mainly on Northern Sweden and in the former Danish province of Bohuslän. The witch hunt started when Lars Elvius, church pastor in Älvdalen in Dalarna, interrogates the little shepherd girl Gertrud Svensdotter, who pointed out Märet Jonsdotter for having abducted her to the Witches' Sabbath of Satan in Blockula. This expanded in to a large trial in Mora in Dalarna in 1668, where 17 people were sentenced to death for having abducted children to Satan. The children who were supposed victims and witnesses were punished as well (not for having wittnessed, but of having been to Satan and participated in the Sabbath, albeit by being kidnapped) - in Mora, 148 children were sentenced with being whipped or running the gauntlet. The witch trial of Mora attracted attention and caused a hysteria in the country. The witch hunt of 1668-1676 was endemic to its nature: it spread as rumours by way of mouth from parish to parish rather than being confined to one place. The phenomena of witches abducting children to the Witches' Sabbath of Satan of Blockula, where they were exposed to sexual abuse and forced to sell their souls, caused widespread panic among the parents of the nation, and parents of several parishes, alarmed by the rumours among their children, started to demand that the authorities issue investigations in their parishes. In this way, witch trials spread from parish to parish, when more and more parents demanded that their childrens' stories be investigated. Eventually, the witch panic spreading around the provinces and the growing number of local witch trials caused the government to form a central national Witchcraft Commission in an attempt to take control of the situation. The rules of the Witchcraft Commission was issued by the king in 1673 and 1674. The 1673 regulation stated that only those accused who confessed willingly and who had played a leading role were legal to execute. The revised rules of 1674 stated that people could be executed even if they had not confessed, but that torture were, from that point on, legal to use to make them confess (torture had been commonly used before but without legal permission). The Commission was divided into two departments under the supervision of Governor Carl Larsson Sparre, who preserved to right to confirm all sentences before they could legally be carried out. All the condemned were executed by decapitation, after which their remains were burned at the stake. The worst phase occurred in 1675, when about 110 were executed in Ångermanland and Gästrikland. In the Torsåker witch trials in Ångermanland, 71 people; of which 65 women (every fifth woman in Torsåkers parish), 2 men and 4 boys, were beheaded and then burned on the stake on June 1, 1675. According to some sources, 9 people were executed already on March 28 and the remaining 62 on June 1, 1675 on a mountain in the border area between Torsåkers, Dals and Ytterlännäs parishes. In June 1675 the hysteria reached the capital of Stockholm in the form of the migrating child wittness Gävle Boy, who arrived to the capital from the provincial town of Gävle after having testified in his own mothers witch trial. Eight women were executed during the witch trials of the Katarina parish in Stockholm in 1676: Anna Sippel, Britta Sippel, Anna Måndotter, Anna Persdotter Lärka, Maria Jöransdotter, Margareta Matsdotter, Anna Simonsdotter Hack and Malin Matsdotter, the last one of whom was, uniquely, burned alive. The witch trials of the Katarina parish in Stockholm were, however, to be the end of the whole Swedish witch hunt. During the proceedings in Stockholm, several members of the Witchcraft Commission, notably Eric Noraeus and Urban Hiärne, had a growing concern over the rights of those accused and the testimonies used to condemn them, particularly as the testimonies were given by children who were merely asked to confirm their former statement rather than to repeat them. On 11 September 1676, one of the child witnesses admitted to have lied in court. This confession was followed by the complete breakdown of all the child witnesses before court, who admitted to having lied and who were instead charged with perjury. As a consequence, the Witchcraft Commission immediately order a stop of the witch hunt nationwide, and started to issue investigation in how the witch hysteria could be effectively stopped. In 1677, the Witchcraft Commission and the government ordered the clergy nationwide to stop all witch panic by conducting a prayer of gratitude in their pulpits, thanking God that the witches had now been banned forever from the Kingdom. When some of the clergymen protested and insisted that the witches had indeed been guilty and the sorcery real, they were lectured by the Witchcraft Commission and forced to comply. By that act, the great witch hunt known as the Great Noise of 1668-1676 was ended in Sweden and the Witchcraft Commission was dissolved. The end While the Witchcraft Act of 1608 was still legally in force, the Svea Court of Appeal was reluctant to confirm death sentences for witchcraft reported to them by local courts after 1676. While witchcraft cases occasionally appeared in the late 17th- and early 18th-century, they were few and isolated, and guilty verdicts of local courts were normally commuted to lesser punishment or repealed altogether by the high courts. It is dubious whether the 1693 trial against the Sami shaman Lars Nilsson should be categorized as a witch trial. Similar to Eric Clauesson two centuries prior, he was in actuality executed for Paganism or idolatry, having worshipped a Pagan god. However, the Christian church regarded Pagan gods to be demons and worshipping them to be Satanism, which enabled an execution for witchcraft. This case was a part of the Christianization of the Sami people. The death sentences of a witch trial in Vendel in 1687 were all repealed by the Svea Court of Appeal, and the witch trials of Malung in 1708 and Leksand in 1714 both ended in acquittals. In 1711 a Baron Lütsow, and in 1718 the Uppsala student Daniel Salthenius were both sentenced to death for having made a Deal with the Devil, but in both cases the sentenced was commuted to imprisonment. On 15 June 1704, Anna Eriksdotter was decapitated as the last person executed for witchcraft in Sweden. In 1724, the Södra Ny witch trial of Värmland resulted in several people sentenced guilty of witchcraft, but they were not executed, but instead sentenced to be whipped and banished from their parish. This witch trial was first handled by the local court. When the high court was made aware of it, they took control over it in order to stop it. They restricted themselves to sentence only those who had themselves confessed. The court referred to them as fools, who confessed themselves guilty because of insane dreams influenced by stories about the Great Noise fifty years prior. The last witch trial in Sweden took place in Åhl in Dalarna in 1757, were several people were subjected to torture and forced to confess. This trial was conducted by the local church by approval of the local governor. However, while formally legal, as the Witchcraft Act had never been abolished, witch trials were in practice considered a defunct phenomena in Sweden by this point. When countess Cathérine Charlotte De la Gardie, who visited the province of the witch trial, informed the authorities in the capital that a witch trial was taking place in the province, the central authorities immediately ordered the trial to be stopped, and the accused were freed and given monetary compensation for the torture they had been forced to endure. In 1779, the death penalty for witchcraft was finally abolished.

He's best known for having followed and helped Fabrizio Ruffo and the Sanfedisti army to restore the Kingdom of Naples and the Bourbon dynasty, after the short-lived Parthenopean Republic (1799). In 1836, after a few decades, he published his memoirs of that period, titled Memorie storiche sulla vita del cardinale Fabrizio Ruffo.http://www.ilredattore.it/index.php?option=com_k2&view;=item&id;=3313:l-abate- sacchinelli-con-il-cardinale-ruffo-per-la-santa-fede&Itemid;=953 The first page of the memoirs written by abbot Domenico Sacchinelli  Life  Domenico Sacchinelli was born in Pizzoni, Calabria (Italy), from Francesco Sacchinelli and Serafina Conciatore,Govanni Pititto, Archivio Storico della Calabria - Nuova Serie - Anno I.

Nonetheless, when he was just 18 years old, he decided to leave his hometown in order to get a job as a scribe in the city of Catanzaro, inside the Cassa sacra; this was an institution founded by king Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies to recover from the earthquake occurred in 1783.Maria Lombardo, L'abate Sacchinelli, con il cardinale Ruffo per la Santa Fede - 14/7/2015. Ne \\"Il retadattore.it (pubblicazione on line) Fonte In this new position, thanks to the rigid education he had been given, he proved to be highly skilled and professional in his job, and because of this he was highly respected by his superior, the auditor and government inspector Carlo Pedicini, who wanted Sacchinelli to work for him in his new seat in Monteleone. There he could continue his education and in 1794 he was ordained as priest,Tino Puntillo, Bagnara 1799-1815 - Patrioti e briganti durante l'occupazione francese. Anno I, numero 1.Pag. 25.

The Sanfedisti Army in 1799, led by Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo and protected by Saint Anthony The activities carried out inside the diocese and his intellectual skills (reported by his superiors) managed to bring him closer to Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, who was then in Calabria, busy in recruiting militias, which would form the Christian Royal Army, (, later known as Army of Holy Faith ). Ruffo wanted him to join the espedition, hiring him as undersecretary (), with a wage of twenty ducats per monthGiovanni Maresca, Carteggio del Cardinale Fabrizio Ruffo, con Lord Acton e la regina Maria Carolina. ASPN, Anno VIII, Fasc. II, (1983) pag. 289. This episode was crucial in Sacchinelli's life, who switched from being a humble priest in a small town to being involved in battles which led to the fall of the Parthenopean Republic (1799) and to the Restoration of the Bourbon kings. In this period, he was close to Cardinal Ruffo, sharing all the most delicate moments and decision; later in his life, he wrote a memoir on Ruffo's life. After the restoration, he continued to collaborate with Ruffo, travelling between Rome, Naples, Palermo and Paris and following, as a secretary, Ruffo's affairs. In this period, he was also promoted abbot, but the exact date is unknown. He's also remembered in history as an abbot, but he probably didn't belong to any religious order, and he may instead have been a \\"secular abbot\\". On August 1823, he had the privilege to join the Conclave, where new Pope Leo XII was elected, following also in this situation the Cardinal Ruffo, who wanted Sacchinelli to accompany him as a conclavist.Mario Casaburi, Fabrizio Ruffo: l'uomo, il cardinale, il condottiero, l'economista, il politico.

She is credited with helping pioneer the popularization of the woodturning field and the application of color in wood art. She is noted as being one of the few women in the craft field, when she first began turning during the 1970s. Early life Merryll Saylan was born in 1936 in the Pelham Parkway area of The Bronx borough of New York City. She moved to and lived in Los Angeles in her youth, where she had an early musical education in piano and viola. She attended UCLA right after graduating high school, where she met her first husband, but would drop out. She ended up attending UCLA once again, after first taking some classes at Santa Monica City College. Woodturning Saylan began woodturning in the mid-1970s. On her earliest works, Saylan recalled, \\"When I first started I had been making sculpture, but to pay my studio rent, started turning bowls. I also made turned and constructed furniture.\\" In 1982, a house's workshop space in Berkeley, California, caught the attention of Saylan and her partner, Edward Saylan. The two, with the help of fellow artist friends, would remodel the house over the next three decades or so. Saylan came from a background in modern and contemporary design. During her second tenure attending UCLA for her undergraduate studies, she chose design as her major. During her time in college, she tended to her three children after classes. She was one of the first women in the woodturning field; in an interview with the American Association of Woodturners (AAW), she stated, \\"It was definitely a guy's game in the beginning. I remember reading that in one of the earliest newsletters.\\" From the early 1980s on, Saylan helped pioneer the application of color in wood art. Additionally, her combining of materials, as well as the surface texturing in her works, helped make her pieces more unique during an era of wood art in which furniture-making was the norm and the natural look of the wood was a primary concern. The Seattle Post- Intelligencer commented that her Jelly Donut (1979) work \\"incorporates one segment of red resin, as if a prosthetic body part,\\" for example. She completed her M.A. in studio art at CSUN. In 1986, she became a member of the newly established AAW and would serve as president of its board from 1995 to 1996. At the request of Art in Embassies, Saylan visited Fiji in February 2004, where she presented her work and held workshops for students and local art organizations. The U.S. Department of State noted that Saylan's visit prompted attention from the Fijian media and was \\"covered extensively by a few national papers as well as a nationally televised channel.\\" Saylan's life and work are documented in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Several of her works are exhibited in museums across the United States; the Mint Museum of Craft + Design in Charlotte, North Carolina houses her Jelly Donut, as well as her Untitled (1998) piece. In 2016, Saylan was noted by the AAW to reside and continue to work in Berkeley, California. In 2018, however, Saylan put her Berkeley home up for sale and moved to Colorado to live closer to her son and grandchildren.

Life  His father was baron Ottavio Serena, a historian and politician of the early years of the Kingdom of Italy, while his mother was Maria Priore. In his youth, he studied law in Rome and, after graduation, he went to war, serving as Ufficiale di artiglieria during World War I, until he was appointed Segretario con funzioni di Capo-gabinetto del Sottosegretario di Stato inside the Italian ministry Ministero Approvvigionamenti e Consumi. From February 1921 to February 1926, he was part of the Inter-Allied Commission for War Reparations in Bulgaria (), and in this period he lived in Sofia; there he was promoted to Capo Servizio, Segretario Generale, Delegato d'Italia and Presidente della Commissione. In the last years of his life, he returned to Italy, where he died on 6 March 1938 at the age of 63.  Works  Nicola Serena di Lapigio wrote articles for many Italian and local newspapers, namely Tribuna, Rassegna Nazionale, Le Vie d'Italia and Rassegna Pugliese, where he was appointed co-director from 1909 to 1913. On the pages of this last newspaper, he published literary essays and reviews. In 1907, he published his work Cesaria (B. Lux, Roma), followed in 1909 by the collection of novels Piccole anime e piccole cose, printed in Milan by poublisher Casa Editrice Cogliati; the preface was written by Antonio Fogazzaro. After a period of stagnation, his passion for writing appeared again in the 1930s, when he published a new collection of novels titled Vecchi racconti. =Panorami garganici= In 1934, he published what is probably his masterpiece, the collection of travel memoirs Panorami garganici, which comprised both new and already published novels. The book, divided into nine chapters and including many pictures of Italian region Gargano, contributed to raise awareness on this area, which was then practically uninhabited. Serena di Lapigio had a strong passion for Italian region Apulia (lo Sperone d'Italia), which he knew very well, from Isole Tremiti, then a prison, to Monte Sant'Angelo, from the coast of San Menaio, to Foresta Umbra. In his writings, he merged his sensitivity to the nature of Gargano with the objectivity of the research of history. His prose is both elegant and clear.

This allowed him to win a scholarship and become an enrolled student there from 1906 to 1907. He then transferred to the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School, Weimar, where he studied from 1909 to 1913. World War I marked a turning point in his career. At the age of twenty-six, he was recalled from studies in Italy, inducted, and posted to the western front. He fought until 1918, mostly at the front lines, was badly wounded, and reposted after a stay in the hospital. His experiences left him embittered and suffering from what is now called PTSD.Heinrich Stegemann 1880–1945, Bilder vom Krieg.

In 1936, the Fine Arts Division of the Reich Chamber of Culture closed what would be the DKB's final exhibition, which he was directing. The following year, forty-three of his works were classified as \\"degenerate art\\" and confiscated. Three were shown at the Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich.

The most conservative sources estimate he wrote 2,600 books. Early life Lafuente Estefanía was born in Toledo in 1903. His father, Federico Lafuente López-Elías, was a lawyer and also an author. He studied industrial engineering and worked in Spain, Angola, South America, and the United States, where he traveled between 1928 and 1931. During the Spanish Civil War he would become an artillery general in the Republican army. Upon their defeat, he refused to go into exile, and during the subsequent repression he was incarcerated several times and nearly executed. According to Lafuente's son, Federico Lafuente Beorlegui (see Spanish naming customs), during the war Lafuente Estefanía met humor novelist and playwright Enrique Jardiel Poncela, who advised him to write stories that would amuse people, as he believed it to be \\"the only way to live off writing\\". Once released from prison in the early 40s, Lafuente began writing mass-market paperbacks, initially for a small publisher in Vigo. His political allegiances and his imprisonment had made him an outcast under the fascist regime, closing him all doors to any jobs in his own trade: thus mass-market literature became his lifesaver. His first books were romances, which he published under his wife's name, María Luisa Beorlegui. In 1943 he published his first western, La mascota de la pradera. He would continue to cultivate this genre until his death. Work In 1947 and 1948, Lafuente Estefanía and several other western authors, many of them liberal professionals like him now forced to resort to pulp literature for survival, were attracted toward Spanish publisher Bruguera. Among them were Silver Kane (pen name of lawyer Francisco González Ledesma) or Keith Luger (Miguel Oliveros Touan). At the time, Bruguera was building an empire of popular literature spanning the whole Hispanic world, cemented on mass-market paperbacks and comic-books; Francisco Ibáñez, of Mortadelo y Filemón fame, and M.L. Estefanía became Bruguera's star names. According to Silver Kane, Bruguera's guidelines were very strict; novels had to be catchy from page one, and there was heavy censorship. It was frequent to turn in a completed manuscript (around a hundred pages) every week. Given these limitations, Silver Kane said he was often surprised by how good the novels were. Lafuente Estefanía's novels became the readers' favorites. They had a deep impact in the pop culture of Spain, Latin America and the Southern United States in the 50s and 60s. First printings of 30,000 copies were frequent. In the golden years of the format (late 50s and early 60s) printings reached 100,000 copies. Lafuente's creative process often involved adapting popular dramas into typical Far West settings and stock characters. He was also unique among other Spanish western authors in that he had visited the American west he was writing about. Eventually, Lafuente Estefanía's sons, Francisco and Federico, would join the family business by churning out novels under their father's name. Death and legacy Lafuente Estefanía died on August 7, 1984 in Madrid. His sons and later a grandson continued to write novels under the same name, still published by Ediciones B (Bruguera's rebranded name after its acquisition by Grupo Zeta). Adding all hands behind it, the house name \\"M.L. Estefanía\\" is estimated to have sold fifty million books as of 2007. In an interview in 2008, Federico Lafuente Beorlegui, last surviving son of Marcial, explained he continued to write one novel a week, now released under the family's own imprint, Cíes. According to him, the Latino population of the U.S. are currently the biggest consumers of Spanish westerns.

Founded in 2018 by Frank Reig and Paul Suhey, it first started with a small pilot program in New York, later growing its fleet size in New York and expanding into Washington, D.C. History Revel was founded in 2018 by Frank Reig who serves as CEO and Paul Suhey who serves as COO. In July 2018 it started with a 10-month pilot in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens with 68 scooters, eventually replacing them with 1,000 new scooters in the space of one week in May 2019. On August 16, 2019, Revel expanded to Washington, D.C. with a pilot program of 400 mopeds compared with a total of 5,600 other bikes and scooters from other sharing companies. Their first crash was reported the same weekend. As of June 2019, Revel has about 40 employees in New York, all full-time with insurance and benefits. In Washington they employ a further 30 employees. The mopeds it uses are not owned by the company; rather, outside companies buy the mopeds and lease them to Revel. Vehicles thumb Revel's mopeds are manufactured by a Chinese company called NIU and sell for between $3000 and $5000 retail. They weigh about , are powered by 2 lithium-ion batteries, and have a range of with a top speed of . The batteries are replaced by Revel employees when they need to be recharged. They are equipped with two helmets which Revel says are cleaned every two or three days. All Revel mopeds are registered with the DMV and have license plates. Driving requirements Drivers must be 21 or older, have a valid license, and pay a $19 fee for the verification. The company provides a free half-hour rider instructor course but has faced criticisms for its untrained riders and the small number of available lessons compared to the number of new riders. The mopeds are driven and parked on the street, unlike other scooter or bike-sharing companies whose bikes take up space on the sidewalks. Revel does not permit its mopeds for use on major highways and bridges. Safety incidents and legal challenges Its first personal injury lawsuit came in July 2019 after a driver hit a biker, severely breaking the latter's ankle which required surgery. Police claim the biker pulled in front of the Revel driver who was turning left, causing a collision. The biker's lawyer, however, states that police did not take a statement from his client and it was the Revel driver who collided with the biker as he was attempting a left turn. The suit claims that Revel is liable for \\"failure to assure its users ... had sufficient knowledge and skill to operate the moped; failed to ascertain previous experience in operating the moped\\", noting that the lessons offered by Revel were backlogged. On August 9, 2019, a Revel rider was hit by a car from a rideshare company. Police say the rider ran a red light, while witnesses say the car was speeding as it passed through the intersection. The first crash involving a Revel bike in Washington, D.C. occurred on August 18, 2019, the same weekend as their debut. A driver hit a pothole and fell off his moped which landed on top of him, breaking his collarbone. The company responded saying \\"Safety is our number one priority. This is why we verify riders have a safe driving history as part of our registration process, why we require all riders to use the helmets we provide on each Revel, and why we offer free lessons.\\" On August 31, 2019, two boys on a Revel in Washington, D.C. moped opened fire on an Uber car, leaving the driver with injuries from the shattered glass. On July 18, 2020, CBS New York reporter Nina Kapur was killed while riding as a passenger on a moped in New York City. Less than two weeks later, on July 27, a 32-year-old man was also killed in New York while riding a moped. He was wearing a helmet, but Kapur was not wearing one. Following their deaths, Revel temporarily suspended operations in New York.

The mall was founded in 1996.  History  Galaxy Mall 1 (former called Mal Galaxy) built in 1994. Two years later, the construction was completed and opened. At the time, the shopping center was managed by PT. Sinar Galaxy. The main tenants at that time were Hero Supermarket, Timezone, Keris Department Store, McDonald's and Galaxy 21. Galaxy Mall also has Techno Zone (computer and handphone center) to date, on the 2nd floor, the food court of the archipelago and internationally (now Food Galaxy) in 3rd floor. In 2005, Galaxy Mall developed, expanded and added one extension, namely Galaxy Extension Mall (now Galaxy Mall 2) with the main tenants Sogo Department Store and Celebrity Fitness, completed and opened in 2006. In the same year, Hero Supermarket at Galaxy Existing Mall (the old Galaxy Mall building which opened in 1996), is now occupied by an international supermarket, which is 99 Ranch Market. In 2010, the name of the shopping center changed to Galaxy Mall because many residents in Surabaya mentioned the name and in the same year, the Galaxy 21 cinema was transformed into the Galaxy XXI cinema. In 2011, the first Centro Department Store in Surabaya was opened. In 2013, McDonald's at Galaxy Mall 1, 2nd floor was closed and is now occupied by Erafone Megastore. While McDonald's at Galaxy Mall 1, 2nd floor moved its location to Jalan Manyar Kertoarjo, precisely at the former Pertamina gas station. In 2016, construction of Galaxy Mall 3 has begun. On July 10, 2018, an elevated bridge was installed connecting Galaxy Mall 1 and 2 with Galaxy Mall 3. Furthermore, this bridge also functions as a crossing bridge for people equipped with their own elevators, and will also be integrated with rapid transportation, namely the monorail implemented by the city government Surabaya. On April 19, 2019, Galaxy Mall 3 was completed and opened with H&M;, Uniqlo and Burger King as one of its main tenants. = Controversy = After Galaxy Mall 3 construction was finished in 2019, rumors circulated that the next Galaxy Mall will also have a 4th stage. Galaxy Mall 4, according to rumors, will be built in an area currently occupied by sports facilities owned by the Indonesian National Sports Committee (KONI) of East Java. According to news circulating as well, the current location of the KONI facility will be moved to vacant land in Puri Galaxy housing on Jalan Arief Rahman Hakim, which is quite strategic because it is close to the campus of the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology and Hang Tuah University.

It is located on the side of Meiyuan Hill. Palaeontological interest started in 2004 when a farmer accidentally found bones that were later identified as mammalian fossils. Excavations started in 2006 by paleontologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has yielded many stone tools and over 30 human fossils, and animal bones including those of Ailuropoda, Arctonyx, Bubalus, Sinomegaceros, Stegodon, giant tapir, and giant pandas. The most notable fossils are that of a Homo erectus (dubbed Dongzhi Man) described in 2014, and that of a 300,000-year-old archaic human discovered in 2019. Stone tool Hualong Cave shows the lifestyle of humans in the Paleolithic Age. Bone tools were used for cutting animals but not for hunting. More than 100 stone tools have been discovered. These stone tools were made from siliceous rocks. Scrapers were the most abundant tools. Animal fossil More than 40 species of mammalian fossils have been discovered from Hualong Cave. The majority of them are even-toed ungulates. Only few rodents can be identified. Important specimens include Ailuropoda, Arctonyx, Bubalus, Sinomegaceros, stegodon, giant tapir, and giant pandas. The occurrence of Sinomegaceros in the cave is remarked as the most southern in China. Human fossil =Dongzhi Man= Popularized as Dongzhi Man, a human fossil described in 2014 from Hualong Cave is considered as among the most well-preserved Homo erectus specimens. It was discovered discovered in 2006 along with stone artifacts and animal fossils during the first excavation. It consisted of two skull fragments and one separated (lower molar) teeth. The skull fragments were believed to be from the same individual. It is different from other fossils of the same species including Peking Man found in China. The teeth surfaces (enamel-dentine junctions) are much simpler and the cusps are sharper. =Archaic Homo sapiens= In 2019 a discovery of 16 human fossils was announced which were estimated to be about 300,000 (275,000–331,000) years old. The fossil assemblage included 8 cranial elements, seven isolated teeth, three femoral diaphyseal pieces, and major portions of an adolescent skull (designated HLD 6, HLD for Hualongdong). They were identified as archaic Homo sapiens. HLD 6 is remarkable as it was analyzed to be that of an adolescent person aged 13-15. It has large brain size of 1150 cc.

Formerly known as Forterus Inc., it is headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, and operates as a subsidiary of AAC Holdings. The company delivers addiction treatment services in residential and outpatient facilities, as well as providing drug testing and diagnostic laboratory services.  History  American Addiction Centers was founded in 2007 by Michael Cartwright (currently CEO) as Forterus Inc. In October 2014, the company went from privately held to public, becoming the first publicly traded addiction treatment provider in the U.S. As of 2019, it remains the only public company in the U.S. addiction treatment industry. In December 2014, American Addiction Centers made its first acquisition as a public company, taking over Recovery First Inc., a Florida-based substance abuse and rehab services company. By 2015, American Addiction Centers ran 8 facilities in 6 states after acquiring several sites in California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Mississippi. Among the company’s acquisitions in 2015 were also two digital marketing firms focused on publishing online content on substance abuse – Referral Solutions Group and Taj Media. In 2015, the company launched a Behavioral Health Academic Scholarship Program, providing scholarship funds to college students pursuing careers in addiction-related fields. By 2018, American Addiction Centers was operating 12 residential treatment centers and 18 outpatient facilities, and reported a revenue of almost $296 million. In 2019, AAC received three warnings from the New York Stock Exchange, risking being delisted. The third warning was issued after AAC stock traded below $1 for at least 30 trading days.  Controversy  In 2018, a California jury issued a verdict against AAC, awarding $7 million to the family of a patient who committed suicide in a AAC facility and died 20 hours after his arrival. According to an investigation by Mother Jones, centers managed by AAC often leave patients unattended, which led to some patient deaths and lawsuits. AAC denies it and claims that their death rate is the lowest in the industry.

History In the 1870s the local vestry board, which performed local government functions, used a 19th century vestry hall at 21 Paradise Road for their meetings. After the area became a metropolitan borough in 1890, civic leaders decided this arrangement was inadequate for their needs and that they would procure a purpose-built town hall: the site chosen for the building was occupied by the Castle Hotel in Richmond, which was purchased by Sir John Whittaker Ellis, the local Member of Parliament, and donated by him in 1888. The foundation stone for new building was laid, which was built by Lansdowne & Company, was laid in 1891: it was designed by W J Ancell in Elizabethan Renaissance style and officially opened by the Duke of York on 10 June 1893. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with six bays facing onto Whittaker Street; the central section featured an arched entrance flanked by Doric order pilasters on the ground floor; there was an oriel window above the doorway with niches on either side; there were three smaller windows above the entrance on the second floor; a turret was installed at the north west corner of the building at roof level and a projecting clock, made by the Leeds firm of William Potts & Sons, was installed on the Hill Street frontage. The principal rooms were the council chamber and the mayor's parlour on the first floor. A bust of Sir John Whittaker Ellis by Francis Williamson was unveiled by Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck on the staircase of the building in 1895. The council chamber was completely gutted and other parts of the building badly damaged by a fire-bomb on 29 November 1940 during the Blitz; following a complete restoration to the designs of Gordon Jeeves, the building was reopened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 16 December 1952. The building continued to serve as the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Richmond for much of the 20th century but ceased to be the local seat of government when the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames was formed in 1965. Instead York House in Twickenham performed that role for the new borough. The old town hall was refurbished as part of scheme to redevelop the riverside area to the designs of Quinlan Terry in 1988. Although some of the building's ground floor was subsequently leased for retail use, most of the former town hall was retained to accommodate the Central Reference Library and the Museum of Richmond which was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 October 1988. A section of the building was also converted into an art gallery (the Riverside Gallery) and the Local Studies Collection moved into the building in 2000.

Biography =Provenance and early years= Kurt Pinthus was born in Erfurt. He grew up in Magdeburg and Erfurt. Louis Pinthus (1852–1912), his father, was a Jewish businessman. Bertha Rosenthal (1864–1934), his mother, was unmarried. Kurt attended the \\"Königliche Gymnasium\\" (as it was known at that time), one of the two church-sponsored secondary schools in Erfurt. In 1905 he embarked on his university career, studying successively at Freiburg, Berlin, Geneva and Leipzig: his focus was on History, History of literature and Philosophy. It was from Leipzig that he received his doctorate in 1910, supervised by Albert Köster (1862–1924). His other teachers during this period included the economic historian Karl Lamprecht (1856–1915), the literary historian Georg Witkowski (1863–1939), the literary expressionist Franz Werfel (1890–1945) and the expressionist poet and dramatist Walter Hasenclever (1890–1940), with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. =War= In 1912 he took a job as a literary editor with the newly founded Kurt Wolff publishing house which brought him into contact with several literary stars of the age, including Franz Kafka, Georg Heym and Else Lasker-Schüler. In 1915 he was conscripted in connection with the war and sent to join then \\"Kasernendienst\\" in Magdeburg. Following an accident at the barracks to which he had been assigned he operated a \\"damages office\\" on behalf of the injured. The First World War was followed by economic collapse and a succession of revolutionary uprisings in the ports and cities. With thousands of other disillusioned and unemployed former soldiers, Pinthus participated in the Soldiers' Soviet movement. During 1919/20 he compiled and published Menschheitsdämmerung (\\"The Twilight of humanity\\"), an anthology of expressionist poetry from 23 poets (of whom six had been killed during the war). The book was originally produced with a small print run by a small publishing firm in 1919, but following a favourable reception was re-published with a larger print-run in 1920 by Rowohlt. The compilation caught the mood of the times and became a standard literary work, acknowledged by commnetator as a chronicle of the development of expressionist literature. =Berlin= Like his friends Walter Hasenclever and Oskar Kokoschka, in the early summer of 1919 Kurt Pinthus moved to Berlin where he was involved in the postwar refounding of the Rowohlt Publishing Firm. He worked briefly during 1920/21 as a dramaturge at Max Reinhardt's strikingly modernised privately funded and directed theatre in Berlin. The more enduring career that Pinthus built in Berlin during the 1920s was as a critic of stage, literature and film. His contributions appeared regularly in a range of German and international publications, most particularly in \\"Das Tage-Buch\\", \\"Die literarische Welt\\" and the newly (in 1922) founded \\"8 Uhr- Abendblatt)\\". In 1925 he was recruited by Funk-Stunde AG Berlin the first and during this time largest radio broadcaster in Germany, to present a series of literary programmes. His first programme concerned the respected novelist- dramatist Franz Werfel. The series quickly became very popular, and Pinthus continued to work with the broadcaster for eight years, till 1933. As it developed an administrative infrastructure, he became a member of the organisation's literary commission in 1929. It was also in 1929 that he began to lecture regularly at the prestigious Lessing Academy. Pinthus was hugely productive and also, it appears, happy and fulfilled during thin period, attending virtually every new play, film and viriety show, a frequent presence at social events, and always surrounded by friends. That ended in 1933. =Hitler years= During the first part of 1933 the Hitler government lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Antisemitism was transformed from a shrill set of populist slogans into a core element of government strategy. The government produced its first \\"black list\\" on 16 May 1933. Kurt Pinthus was included on it, and received a \\"Berufsverbot\\" (professional ban) which prevented him from public writing, other than for expressly Jewish newspapers and magazines. For several more years, despite the urgent warnings and offers of help from Walter Hasenclever, he persisted with his determination to pursue his career in Nazi Germany under the auspices of the \\"Jüdischer Kulturbund\\" (\\"Jewish Arts and Culture Association\\"), though his letters to friends indicate that he was becoming ever more lonely and depressed. In 1937, belatedly following the examples and promptings of friends, he fled to the United States of America. =America= He found a first foothold at The New School for Social Research in New York City, where he was employed as a lecturer between 1938 and 1940. Due to the number of Jewish exiles from Nazi Germany who had already gravitated to the city he found himself with a ready made netwrok of contacts in the literary arts world. Despite having found employment relatively quickly, he nevertheless regularly met with \\"severe financial problems\\" for several years. Between October 1941 and the end of 1947 he also held a post as academic consultant in respect of the Theatre Collection at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.. As part of his work he authored numerous treatises while at the Library of Congress. Returning to New York, between 1947 and 1961 Kurt Pinthus taught Theatre History at the Columbia University where he accepted a permanent professorship. Already in 1957, however (by which time he had passed his seventieth birthday) he was making regular trips back to Europe. In 1967 he returrned to Germany. Magdeburg and Erfurt, the cities in which he had grown up, had ended up after 1945 administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone, relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), but the version of Germany in which he now made his home was the US backed German Federal Republic (West Germany). Kurt Pinthus settled at Marbach, known to literary scholars as the birthtown of Friedrich Schiller, and located along the river between Mannheim and Stuttgart. =Last years= Marbach was and remains home to the German [national] Literature Archive, which operates under the auspices of the German Schiller Society, and it was here that Kurt Pinthus worked during his final years. On 27 April 1971 Pinthus marked his eighty-fifth birthday by formally transferring his very considerable personal library to the German Schiller Society. He had he had acquired most of his collection during the 1920s and 1930s and succeeded in shipping it to New York between December 1937 and May 1938. Reflecting his work as a literary reviewer during the \\"Weimar years\\", it includes numerous first editions of volumes that had become very rare thanks to their inclusion in the Nazi book burnings.

Edouard Bard - 2010  Biography  After studying geological engineering (ENSG) in Nancy, Édouard Bard began his research at the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA) in Gif-sur-Yvette (doctoral thesis in 1987) and continued at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in New York as a postdoctoral fellow in 1988 and as an associate researcher in 1989. Back in France, he first joined the CEA as a researcher, then began teaching as a professor at the University of Aix-Marseille in 1991 and at the Collège de France in 2001.Collège de France He is currently Deputy Director of the European Centre for Research and Education in Environmental Geosciences (CEREGE)CEREGE. at the Arbois Technopole in Aix-en-Provence and coordinates the EQUIPEX ASTER-CEREGE,EQUIPEX ASTER-CEREGEAixMICADAS. project. Édouard Bard is the author of more than 200 articles in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, as well as some thirty popular articles (some available for downloadArticles de vulgarisation disponibles au téléchargement) and books intended for the general public, including L'Homme et le climat, Découvertes Gallimard, 2005L'Homme et le climat. and director-author of L'Homme face au climat, Odile Jacob, 2006L'Homme face au climat. and L'Océan, le climat et nous: un équilibre fragile ?, Le Pommier & Universcience, 2011.L'Océan, le climat et nous : un équilibre fragile ? In 2011 and 2012, he was scientific curator of the exhibition \\"L'océan, le climat et nous\\" at the Cité des sciences et de l'industrie de la Villette in Paris. Since 2004, Édouard Bard has organized numerous symposia and symposia at the Collège de France on climate and ocean change, some of which are widely open to the general public and politicians, such as \\"L'Homme face au climat\\" in 2004, \\"Closing the Fourth International Polar Year\\" in 2009 in partnership with the Senate,Vidéos « Clôture de la quatrième année polaire internationale » \\"Arctic : the major scientific challenges\\" in 2012 in partnership with the Arctic Workshop,Vidéos «Arctique : les grands enjeux scientifiques» \\"Climate, energy and society: the Collège de France and COP21\\" in 2015 with the participation of the President of the Republic, François Hollande.Vidéos «Climat, énergie et société : le Collège de France et la COP21» In 2007, he was vice-president of Group 1 of the Grenelle de l'Environnement on the fight against climate change and energy management,Rapport du groupe 1 du Grenelle de l’Environnement and participated in the French government delegations in Ilulissat in Greenland and Bali in Indonesia for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP13). In 2009, he was a member of the Commission du Grand Emprunt national (Programme des investissements d'avenir) chaired by Alain Juppé and Michel Rocard, former prime ministers.Rapport de la Commission du Grand Emprunt national From 2010 to 2013, he was a member of the Scientific Council of OPECST.  Scientific contributions  Édouard Bard's scientific work is at the interface of climatology, oceanography and geology. Its main objective is to understand the natural functioning of the ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-biosphere system on time scales ranging from a few centuries to several million years. Better documenting these changes, accurately dating them, understanding their mechanisms and modelling them are important tasks in projects to predict future climate change. For his research, Édouard Bard uses analytical chemistry techniques to determine the magnitude and chronology of climate variations. New quantitative methods have allowed him to reconstruct past environments from various archives such as marine and lake sediments, corals, stalagmites and polar ice. The common thread is the desire to study the same climatic phenomena, such as glaciations, using complementary and often innovative geochemical techniques. To study the climate of the past, he uses \\"time machines\\" - sophisticated mass spectrometers to measure radioactive isotopes and date climate variations recorded in geological archives. Another feature of his research is a back and forth between studies of past and recent periods, as well as current environments. Since variations in the climate system involve mechanisms with very different time constants, it is indeed crucial to have a long-term perspective in order to be able to distinguish the effects of climate forcings according to their geological, astronomical and anthropogenic origins.

A design used in the Appalachian region has ten circular saws on a twenty-foot shaft which is carried by an MD 500 helicopter, typically using a rigid boom of about 80 feet long on a gimbal mount, so that the saw can swing below the aircraft. The saw blades are powered by a 28-horsepower engine and the assembly weighs 830 pounds. This design is used to prune trees for customers such as American Electric Power. Another design, with a single, horizontal, 47-inch, circular saw blade, is used to cut the tops off trees which are at risk of falling across power lines.  Operation  The aerial saw is not used only to make new paths for transmission or power lines, but also for maintaining the paths initially cut by the aerial saws. The aerial saw is suspended from a helicopter able to support the swinging weight of the saw. Once the saw is attached to the helicopter, it is turned on and precisely piloted alongside potentially troublesome tree branches. Normally, more than one pass by the branches is needed to ensure adequate coverage. The branches are then picked up by a ground crew and disposed of properly.  Design  The design of the aerial saw is fairly simple. It involves ten two-foot diameter circular saw blades (normally seen in Table saws) mounted on a vertical shaft which is around twenty feet long. Those ten circular saw blades are driven by a 28 horsepower engine. The engine is able to run all ten blades at speeds up to four-thousand revolutions per minute (RPM). The shaft is then attached to a ninety-foot aluminum boom (or beam) then attached to the helicopter where the pilot can remotely control the saw.  Safety & Regulations  The aerial saw is inherently dangerous due to its construction and size. This danger allows for the quick removal of tree branches that are a potential hazard. This danger is kept in line with very strict protocols and precautions. In order for one of these saws to be used in a residential area, a safety buffer must be in place prior to work. The operation must be monitored and certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for each business to use. This certification, as well as the required insurance coverage, is earned only through safe operation of the power saw.  History  Prior to 1986, the side trimming of trees for electric utilities was done by climbing crews or workers armed with mechanical trimmers. Then in 1985, Aerial Solutions Inc. (ASI) pioneered the use of helicopters for side trimming of paths for more than 20 utility, pipeline companies, and governmental agencies throughout the United States. American Electric Power (AEP) began using the aerial saw to clear out paths for transmission lines in 1986. These transmission lines were first established in Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, where the terrain is known to be very mountainous and difficult to access with hand power tools.

His son, Peter Maverick (1780–1871), also became a well-known printmaker, and his other students included Francis Kearney. Maverick is variously reported as being born in England, Cheshire, Connecticut, and New York City. The most concrete evidence, however, makes it clear that he was born in New York City, as the son of Andrew Maverick, who was himself baptized in Boston, and made freeman of New York City on July 17, 1753. The younger Maverick married twice: to Ann Reynolds on July 4, 1772, in New York City, and to Rebecca Reynolds on June 1, 1788, in New York City. In August 1775 he was Ensign in Captain M. Minthorn's company of Colonel John Jay's second regiment of the New York Militia, and on July 23, 1788, represented the Engravers in the New York Federal Procession. He was also a Scottish Rite Mason as a member of both Holland Lodge and Holland Mark Lodge in New York City. Maverick was probably originally a silversmith in New York City, and advertised in New York and Newark papers as being in the engraving, seal-sinking, and copper-plate engraving business. He engraved bookplates, broadsides and occasional portraits, as well as banknotes. He had a workshop at 65 Liberty Street in New York City. His work is collected in the Newark Public Library and Yale University Art Gallery. Maverick's date and place of death are also variously reported as either 1807 or 1811, in either New York City or Newark, New Jersey. There is clear evidence, however, that he died on December 12, 1811, in New York City. (The contemporary Newark Centinel of Freedom, 1811, cited by William Dunlap, reports both his birth and death in New York City, with dates specified in this article.)

He conspired against Benstrup, but proved an unworthy successor as Fabrikmester. In later life he achieved notability in translating Lutheran texts from English and German, into Danish. Personal Born in Aarhus on 1 May 1704, Diderich de Thurah moved to Ribe when his father, Laurids Thura, became bishop of Ribe in 1713. He and his younger brother, Lauritz de Thurah, met King Frederik IV when the monarch was visiting Ribe and chose the two boys for military service. In 1719, he went to Copenhagen as a military cadet, a landkadet in Danish, to receive an education at the Military Cadet Academy (Landkadetakademiet). His older brother, Albert, became a priest and poet.Kornerup in Gyldendal The painting Project Runeberg - Catalogue page 654 - 655 of \\"Diderich de Thurah in his office on Nyholm\\" is attributed to O.H. de Lode. Naval career In 1723, Diderich de Thurah received an immediate commission into the Royal Danish navy after presenting a fine carved model in amber of the ship- of-the-line Anne Sophie to the king. He chose to specialise in ship construction, and in April 1724, he was sent on an extended study tour to England together with another Danish officer, Lieutenant Bragenæs. Lieutenant Lauritz Bragenæs died in 1729, less than two years after the study tour was completed. There was some discussion over his salary which was still that of a cadet, and he could not make his travel expenses stretch. He received his lieutenant's salary from 1 January 1725, but continued to plead that lack of funds led to him missing out on several learning opportunities. By 1726, the Danish admiralty was complaining about the lack of written reports with which it could gauge the two lieutenants' industry and the scientific advances he had been sent to learn. They were ordered to justify themselves. In late 1726, a book of plans for a 72-gun ship-of-the-line was produced, and the two lieutenants sought a further year to profit from their studies. In November 1727, they were recalled to Copenhagen. In 1728, Bragenæs and Thurah worked up designs for a 56-gun ship based on English principles – such a ship had to have good sailing qualities and sufficient storage for provisions for longer voyages. In October 1729, together with the experienced shipbuilders Benstrup and Judichær, they critically examined a ship designed by senior lieutenant Krag while that ship was still on the stocks. Benstrup was not happy with Thurah's professional abilities, and relationships soured. Thurah was responsible in 1731 for the purchase of timber for shipbuilding, which necessitated a visit to Holland. Promoted in 1732 and 1734 to the rank of senior lieutenant,Kaptajnløjtnant - see Ranks and insignia of NATO navies' officers he became head of naval shipbuilding, fabrikmester in 1734. Further promoted to captain and then commander (in 1738), Thurah continued to have problems with his finances, requiring a gift from royal funds to settle with his creditors. He was reprimanded for exceeding his authority in the shipyard by removing Turesen from the supervision of the building of the ships JyllandRecord card for Jylland and Dannebrog, and ordered to curb his animosity and attend more professionally to his duties. Although he retained the title of fabrikmester until 1758, his designs were not acceptable for ships of the fleet, and the Frenchman Laurent Barbé was appointed as chief ship designer. From 1758, he was replaced as fabrikmester and given the post of head of customs. A charge of abuse of authority was laid against Thurah in 1764 by a ship owner in Aalborg, when the latter's ship De To Sønner was arrested, a charge vigorously contested by Thurah. =Thurah's ships= Very few ships are credited to Deiderich de Thurah by the Royal Danish Naval Museum:Royal Danish Naval Museum - database *Dannebroge (1739) ship-of-the- line *Fyen (1736) ship-of-the-line (Because of poor sailing qualities, this ship was decommissioned and sold to the Danish Asiatic Company in 1745.)Record card for Fyen (1736) *Langeland (1736) brig *Møen (1736) brig *Windhunden (1754) yacht or kongebaadRecord card for Windhunden (1754)Launch date was either 1754 (Skibregister) or 1753 (Royal Danish Naval Museum records).

A carving in amber of the Judichaer designed ship-of-the-line Dronning Anne Sophie was presented to the monarch in 1723 and was on display in the king's art collection. In 1729 and 1730, additional to his shipyard duties, he was art tutor to the 7-year-old crown prince (the future Frederick V of Denmark).Caveat: The source Bjerg in Gyldendal names the crown prince as the future Christian VI, but the dates are wrong. Frederik IV died in 1730 and the young crown prince was his grandson - see List of Danish monarchs On leaving the navy, until his death in 1788, Thurah was busy for many years with literary work and translations, particularly in relation to religious art and tracts. Amongst the pieces he translated from English were works by James Blair, Thomas Newton, William Sherlock and Lady Pakington. In this later career, he proved more successful than in his earlier life as a naval officer. Burial Thurah died in Copenhagen on 1 March 1788 and was buried in St. Peter's Church, the German-speaking Lutheran church.

It is for two to five players (four best)Illig, Roland. Kaschlan at www.roland-illig.de. Retrieved 20 Sep 2019. and may be played with a Skat pack of 32 French- or German-suited playing cards or a standard 52-card French pack.  Origin  The origin of Kaschlan is not certain but it seems to have surfaced in German East Prussia. In 1882, Frischbier describes Kaschlan as \\"a popular family game in which the Kaschlan, Kaschlansche or Kaschlanka, Polish kasztelanka, (Queen of Diamonds), is the highest card.\\" Thus the name, both of the game and its top trump, comes from the Polish kasztelan which means \\"castellan\\" and its resemblance to Durak suggests that it may have been originally Polish or Russian. Nevertheless, by the mid-19th century, it was a popular Prussian card game, especially among children and women, and was well known enough to lend its name to Prussian idioms. For example, der Magen spielt mit dem Darm Kaschlan meant, literally, \\"my stomach's playing Kaschlan with my bowels\\" i.e. \\"my tummy's rumbling\\" or \\"I'm hungry\\". Näs' on Muul spiele Kaschlan (in Danzig: Kurrhahn, \\"turkey\\" or \\"irascible person\\") meant \\"[his/her] nose and mouth are playing Kaschlan\\" and referred to old people who had lost their teeth and so their nose and chin were so close that they appeared to move together. The game is not recorded in German gaming compendia and, by 1873, was described as \\"no longer common\\" in Danzig, West Prussia, but was still \\"a well known game of chance\\" in East Prussia in 1888. Nevertheless, references to it continue to appear during the early 20th century. Frischbier records that there was often a lot of cheating to avoid becoming the \\"Kaschlan\\", a nickname for the loser. Playing cards marketed inter alia for Kasztelanskie were still being produced in Poland in 1972.KZWP. Vintage playing card pack.  Cards  The game is played with a normal Skat pack of 32 French-suited cards. If German playing cards are used, the Obers replace the Queens and the Unters the Jacks, as normal. The Queen of Diamonds, the Kaschlan, is the commanding card and the only permanent trump. Apart from that, cards rank in their natural order: A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7. Historically it is recorded that the game was also played with a 52-card pack.  Rules  The game is like a simple variant of multi-player, cut- throat Durak. The following rules are based on Illig: = Aim = The aim is to shed one's hand cards as quickly as possible. The last player left holding any cards is the loser. = Preparations = The dealer shuffles the pack, offers it to rearhand (to his right) to cut and then deals 5 cards to each player. The rest of the cards form the stock or talon and are placed in the middle of the table. The dealer turns the top card to indicate which suit is trumps. Players pick up their cards and play begins. = Play = Forehand (to the dealer's left) now becomes the 'attacker' or 'giver' (Geber) and the player to his left becomes the 'defender' or 'taker' (Nehmer). The attacker places one or more cards of the same rank (e.g. Tens or Kings) in front of the defender. Either way, the attacker may not play more cards than the defender holds in his hand. The attacker then replenishes his hand from the talon, so that he has five cards. If another player also has cards of same rank as the card or cards on the table, he may reinforce the attacker by playing it and replenishing his hand likewise. By this point there will be up to 4 cards on the table. The defender now attempts to capture all these cards individually, placing the captured cards on a common wastepile to one side. A plain-suit card (i.e. non-trump) may be beaten by a higher card of the same suit or by a trump card. A trump card may only be beaten by a higher trump. Example (without trumps): the attacker places the 8 and 8 in front of the defender. If he now has fewer than 5 cards in his hand, he makes it up to 5 from the stock. Another player has the 8 in his hand and reinforces the attack by laying it next to the other Eights. If the defender has K J A 8 and A, he may place the 8 with the other Eights. He can then beat the 8 with the K, the 8 with the J and his 8 with the A. He is unable to beat the 8 and must therefore pick it up. The attacker now lays down more cards. Only when the defender has beaten all the cards played, may he replenish his hand from the stock, so that he has five cards again, and take over the role of attacker; whereupon the player to his left becomes the new defender. If the defender has to pick up a card because he cannot beat it. the attacker lays further cards down. = Going out = When a player is able to shed all his hand cards, he goes out and takes no further part in the game. If he was the attacker, the player before him becomes the new attacker and the defender stays the same. If he was the defender and succeeded in beating all the cards played, the next player in turn becomes the defender and the attacker stays the same. In unlikely event that both attacker and defender shed all their cards, the player after the defender becomes the new attacker. The last player to hold any cards loses the game and is ribbed as the Kaschlan.  Variants  In the 52-card game, if the attacker plays two or more cards of the same rank, he may add another card of his choice, called a 'coachman' (Kutscher). There may therefore be up to 5 cards on the table for the defender to try and beat, including the coachman. In another variant, if the defender is unable to beat all the cards, the role of attacker rotates rather than remaining the same.  References   Literature  * _ (1888).

Pounamu or greenstone are terms for several types of hard and durable stone found in southern New Zealand. They are highly valued in New Zealand, and carvings made from pounamu play an important role in Māori culture. Geologically, pounamu are usually nephrite jade, bowenite, or serpentinite. The Māori classification of pounamu is by colour and appearance. The main classes are , , , and . The first three are nephrite jade, while is a form of bowenite. * pounamu takes its name from a native freshwater fish (Galaxias maculatus) and is pearly- white or grey-green in colour and varies from translucent to opaque. * pounamu is highly translucent and has a vivid shade of green. It is named after the clearness of the sky and is the rarest variety of pounamu. * pounamu comes in many shades, often with flecks or inclusions, and is named after the leaves of the native kawakawa tree (Macropiper excelsum). It is the most common variety of pounamu. * Tangiwai pounamu is clear like glass but in a wide range of shades. The name comes from the word for the tears that come from great sorrow. In modern usage almost always refers to nephrite jade. Pounamu is generally found in rivers in specific parts of the South Island as nondescript boulders and stones.  Significance to Māori  A wide range of objects Pounamu plays a very important role in Māori culture and is a (treasure). It is and has been an important part of trade between the South Island (tribe) and other . Adze blades made from pounamu was desired for carving of wood, and even with the arrival of metal tools pounamu tools were used. These were often reworked into and other when they were no longer useful for carving wood. After the arrival of to South Island in the middle of the 18th-century production of pounamu increased. Pounamu crafting and trade was important to the economy of . ; signs of wear indicate longevity of active possession due to the hard nature of the stone. Large pounamu boulder () Pounamu increase in (prestige) as they pass from one generation to another. The most prized are those with known histories going back many generations. These are believed to have their own and were often given as gifts to seal important agreements. Pounamu include tools such as (adzes), (chisels), (gouges), (knives), scrapers, awls, hammer stones, and drill points. Hunting tools include (fishing hooks) and lures, spear points, and (leg rings for fastening captive birds); weapons such as (short handled clubs); and ornaments such as pendants (, and ), ear pendants ( and ), and cloak pins. Functional pounamu tools were widely worn for both practical and ornamental reasons, and continued to be worn as purely ornamental pendants () even after they were no longer used as tools. Pounamu is found only in the South Island of New Zealand, known in Māori as ('The [land of] Greenstone Water') or ('The Place of Greenstone'). In 1997 the Crown handed back the ownership of all naturally occurring pounamu to the South Island (or Kai Tahu),\\"Pounamu Management Plan\\", Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu\\"Ngāi Tahu and pounamu\\", Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand as part of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement. Geological formation and location Pounamu has been formed in New Zealand in four main locations; the West Coast, Fiordland, western Southland and the Nelson district. It is typically recovered from rivers and beaches where it has been transported to after being eroded from the mountains. The group of rocks where pounamu comes from are called ophiolites. Ophiolites are slices of the deep ocean crust and part of the mantle. When these deep mantle rocks (serpentinite) and crustal rock (mafic igneous rocks) are heated up (metamorphosed) together, pounamu can be formed at their contact. The Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt has been metamorphosed in western Southland and pounamu from this belt is found along the eastern and northern edge of Fiordland. The Anita Bay Dunite near Milford Sound is a small but highly prized source of pounamu. In the Southern Alps, the Pounamu Ultramafic Belt in the Haast Schist occurs as isolated pods which are eroded and found on West Coast rivers and beaches.  Modern use  Jewellery and other decorative items made from gold and pounamu were particularly fashionable in New Zealand in the Victorian and Edwardian years in the late 19th and early 20th century. It continues to be popular among New Zealanders and is often given as gifts. In 2011, the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key presented the President of the United States Barack Obama a (a type of Māori weapon) created from pounamu carved by New Zealand artist Aden Hoglund. An exhibition curated by Te Papa in 2007 called showcased 200 pounamu items from their collections and linked New Zealand and China through both the geographical location of nephrite and also the high level of artistry achieved in ancient China and then thousands of years later amongst Māori. The exhibition marked 40 years of diplomatic relations between countries when it toured to five venues in China in 2013. In the 2016 animated movie Moana the central premise is to return the stolen heart of Te Fiti which is manifest in a pounamu stone amulet. Fossicking for Pounamu is a cultural activity in New Zealand and allowed on designated areas of the West Coast of the South Island () and is limited to what can be carried unaided; fossicking elsewhere in the tribal area is illegal, while nephrite jade can be sourced legally and freely from Marlborough and Nelson. In 2009 David Anthony Saxton and his son Morgan David Saxton were sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for stealing greenstone, with a helicopter, from the southern West Coast.

It was formed in 1919 by the union of the Billiards Association (founded in 1885) and the Billiards Control Club (founded in 1908). The B&SCC; lost control of both the amateur and professional games in the early 1970s, following a dispute with professional players over challenge matches for the World Billiards Championship, and dissatisfaction from snooker associations outside the UK about the balance of voting power in the organisation, with a large proportion of votes being held in a small number of English areas. Following the loss of its government funding, the B&SCC; went into voluntary liquidation in 1992 and its assets were later acquired by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.  The Billiard Association  On 31 January 1885, a meeting took place at The Sportsman's offices to consider revising the rules of billiards, chaired by a Mr. A. H. Collins-Orme and attended by the majority of the prominent professional billiards players. This followed an article written by journalist Alf Burnett criticising the existing rules. Burnett and Peter Jennings contacted the players with a view to getting together to rewrite the rules. Collins-Orme proposed that an association be created. This was agreed, and \\"The Billiard Association of Great Britain and Ireland, India and the Colonies\\" (known as the Billiard Association) was formed. Ten players were tasked with authoring a new set of rules for English billiards. They were John Roberts Jr. (Chairman), Joseph Bennett, Fred Bennett, George Collins, William Cook, John Roberts Sr., Billy Mitchell, John North, W. J. Peall, John Roberts Sr., Joe Sala and Tom Taylor. The group met weekly in a dining area at the Royal Aquarium, and finished writing the rules on 21 September 1886. The rules were published soon after that. Sydenham Dixon, a staff member at The Sportsman was the driving force behind the formation of the Billiards Association, and the newspaper retained a strong influence over the association's affairs. The influence of the paper over the Association later led to prominent player John Roberts Jr. (who became the Billiards Champion in 1886 when Cook failed to respond to Roberts' challenge for the title) refusing to recognise the Association's authority. The Association came to be recognised as the governing body for billiards, and organised amateur and professional championships. They also produced templates for standard sizes, which tables had to conform to if made on them were to be recognised in official records. The March 1885 match between John Roberts Jr. and Cook, which Roberts won 3,000-2,980 was the first to be held under the rules of the Association. An amateur championship under the \\"all in\\" rules, with no restrictions on the number of consecutive scoring shots that could be played, was organised by the Association in 1892, when Sam Christey beat Sidney Fry 1,500–928. The competition was restricted to players from Great Britain before 1917, which was the first year that champions from other Commonwealth countries were allowed to enter. From 1926, only English and Welsh players were allowed to participate, and the event was renamed the English Amateur Championship. The first snooker competition organised by the Billiard Association was the English Amateur Championship of 1916, which was played to benefit the British Sportsmen's Motor Ambulance Fund.  Billiards Control Council and amalgamation The Billiards Association's control over the professional game of billiards was challenged by the Billiards Control Council (BCC), formed in 1908, which issued a different set of rules. The key differences in the BCC's version were that a player could not make more than two miss shots successively, and a simpler explanation of penalties. The professional players changed their allegiance to the newer Control Council, and the professional championships were played under BCC rules, whilst most amateurs continued to play under Billiards Association rules. The two organisations decided that it was in their mutual interest to amalgamate, and formed the Billiards Association and Control Club, later renamed the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&CC;), in 1919.References *For \\"challenged by the Billiards Control Council (BCC)\\", * For \\"different set of rules ...\\", * For \\"changed their allegiance..\\" * For \\"1908\\", \\"..in 1919\\", Willie Smith defeated Claude Falkiner 16,000-14,500 to win the first BA&CC; title, in May 1920. There were many variations of the rules of snooker at the time, and the new Association codified the rules of snooker in 1919. The new rules included the concept of a in the event of points being level at the end of a frame, and having a instead of playing from when there was no clear shot at the after a . Professional billiard player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis had noticed the increasing popularity of snooker in the mid-1920's, and Davis and Birmingham billiard equipment manager Bill Camkin persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The final of the first snooker world championship in 1927 was held at Camkin's Hall, and Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis 20–11 (although Davis had reached the winning margin at 16–7 before \\"dead frames\\" were played to take the total to the agreed 31 frames) in the final. In 1935, the Women's Billiards Association (WBA) affiliated to the BA&CC; and on 10 June 1936, the Billiards Association and Control Council agreed to take over management of the WBA. Lord Lonsdale, president of the BA&CC;, also became president of the WBA.  Loss of control of the professional game  Leslie Driffield, a member of the BA&CC; Council, was present at a meeting where he the Council nominated him as the challenger to Rex Williams for the professional Billiards Championship. Williams declined to play Driffield within the five months time limit that the BA&CC; Council had set, which expired on 7 July 1970, and forfeited the title, which was then contested between Driffield and Jack Karnehm in June 1971. On 1 October 1970, the Professional Billiard Players Association, which had been reestablished in 1968 Williams and seven other players, disaffiliated from the BA&CC.; The Professional Billiard Players Association changed its name to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association on 12 December 1970, and declared itself the governing body for the professional game, recognising Williams as champion. Driffield and Karnehm were, at first, the only two professionals to recognise the BA&CC; as continuing to have authority over the game.References   From 1972, the WPBSA organised the World Snooker Championship. The BA&CC; had its own premises for the first time in 1970, when it opened offices and a match room, based in Haringey. Vera Selby and Alf Nolan were among the players who took part in exhibition matches at the official opening.Newcastle Evening Chronicle – Tuesday 29 September 1970 p. 13 On 21 January 1971 the Billiards Association and Control Council changed its name to the Billiards and Snooker Control Council (B&SCC;).  Loss of control of the international amateur game  The B&SCC; had a proportional representation system of delegate voting that meant that the representatives from just two English counties, Lancashire and Yorkshire, could outvote the rest of the world. A World Billiards and Snooker Council (WB&SC;) was established in 1971, following a meeting of a number of national associations at a hotel in Malta during the IBSF World Billiards Championship. The associations were dissatisfied that the B&SCC; was controlling both the UK and international games. Player and journalist Clive Everton served as the first secretary, and his office served as the first office of the WB&SC.; In 1973, the WB&SC; renamed itself as the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF) and began to control non-professional billiards and snooker championships.  Decline  From 1967 to 1989 the B&SCC; had received Sports Council grants, but this was, according to Everton, stopped \\"on the grounds of limited efficiency\\", and at the beginning of the 1990s, the B&SCC; was struggling financially as a result of the removal of this funding. The London and Home Counties Billiards and Snooker Association cut links with the B&SCC; in 1990, to start a new English Billiards and Snooker Federation. In 1992, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) was expected to take over the B&SCC;, but following a vote of the B&SCC; members approving this, the WPBSA discovered that the B&SCC; had undeclared contingent liabilities of £100,000 and cancelled the planned takeover. The B&SCC; then went into voluntary liquidation. The WPBSA took over the running of tournaments that had been organised by the B&SCC;, and paid the prize money originally announced. It also bought the B&SCC;'s trophies and other assets from the liquidator and ran the amateur game whilst looking to support the establishment of successor bodies to the B&SCC.;  Successor organisations  =International= The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association is responsible for governing professional billiards and snooker, whilst the International Billiards and Snooker Federation governs the amateur game. =England= The English Partnership for Snooker and Billiards has been the governing body for non-professional snooker in England since June 2019, when a resolution was passed by the English Association of Snooker and Billiards, the previous governing body, to transfer its assets and operations to the EPSB.

During its 46 years of existence, it has repeatedly changed its structural and service subordination, passing from the Ministry of National Defense through the Ministry of Public Security to the Ministry of the Interior, and vice versa, to remain under the Ministry of Interior since 1972. Border Protection Troops soldiers were subject to the same rules and regulations as those of other soldiers of the Polish People's Republic. As a result of political transformation and the setup of the Third Polish Republic, the Border Protection Troops were disbanded on May 16, 1991, and the Border Guard was created in their place as a preventive-type police formation established to protect Poland's borders.Rozporządzenie Rady Ministrów z dnia 24 stycznia 2019 r. w sprawie wykonywania niektórych uprawnień przez funkcjonariuszy Straży Granicznej History =Foundations= On May 17, 1945, the commander of the 2nd Army of the Polish People's Army received the order of the Supreme Commander of the Polish Army No.00264, ordering them to populate the eastern bank of the Odra and Bystrzyca with five infantry divisions - 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12.[Kazimierz Kaczmarek: Druga Armia Wojska Polskiego. Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej, 1978 p. 648] Parallel to this, another decision of the Supreme Commander of the Polish People's Army moved divisions 7, 8 and 10 further west, to the Odra and Lusatian Neisse lines. All work related to the regrouping and occupation of the state border was scheduled for June 10, 1945. This day became a celebration of the Border Protection Troops official establishment. In total, eleven infantry divisions and one armored corps were deployed on the state border.Henryk Dominiczak: Granice państwa i ich ochrona na przestrzeni dziejów 966-1966. Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Bellona, 1997, pp-336-337 Securing the borders with regular armies lasted until November 1945, until the Border Protection Troops were organized. Until now, the internal structure of the division was the basis in organizing border service. Each division protected a section of the border of about long, further subdivided to each protected by a regiment which in turn divided to guarded by a battalion and further divided to of border guarded by a company. =1945-1948= Location of the Border Protection Troops units in 1945 Location of the Border Protection Troops units in October 1946 Border protection by linear units was treated as a transient condition.

On September 27, 1945, the Department Border Protection Troops Inspectorate was formed. Until February 14, 1946 it was subordinate to the First Deputy Minister of National Defense, Division General Vsevolod Strażewski, and from October 30, 1945 to the Second Deputy Minister of National Defense, general Karol Świerczewski.Grzegorz Goryński.

The Main Inspectorate of Border Protection organized the protection of state borders and managed specialist services related to border protection. In this respect, he was subject to the departments of the border service of military districts, and through them the border protection departments. Communication between OW's border service departments and border protection units was secured by independent communications campaigns formed in military districts. BPT departments were created at the level of military districts: BPT I category department at the Command of the Silesian Military District, three BPT II category departments at the Kraków, Pomeranian and Warsaw Military District commands, two BPT III category departments at the Command of the Lublin and Poznan Military Districts. Also formed: eleven BPT branch commands with service sub-units, fifty-three episode commands, two hundred and forty-nine watchtowers, seventeen independent communications companies, Independent Dog Training Center. The BPT department and departments at military districts did not in the strict sense of the word mean the command authorities of the field organizational units, which were the branches and subordinate section commands, watchtowers and transitional checkpoints. These were supervisory and control institutions. The order of September 13 appointed 17 independent communications companies with 99 full-time employees in each. The same order obliged the head of the BPT Department to create a Service Dog Training Center in Ostróda with 82 military positions. The organizational order of the BPT Department of September 29, 1945 divided the state borders into sections of branches, commands and watchtowers. This order also specified the deployment of troops. According to preliminary assumptions, 1st branch was to be located in Żagań, 2nd in Rzepin, 3rd in Stargard, 4th in Gdańsk, 5th in Węgorzewo, 6th in Sokółka, 7th in Włodawa, 8th in Przemyśl, 9th in Nowy Sącz, 10th in Koźle and 11th in Bolkowice. On average, there were 321.6 km per unit, 66.7 km per command, and 14.4 km per border station. Sections 4 and 9 received the longest sections. Based on the order No.0304 of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army of October 28, 1945, heads of BPT departments at the command of military districts organized on November 15, 1945 to fifty-one border control points () to control traffic at border crossings, including 27 road, 19 rail, 4 sea and 1 air. The hurriedly-organized BPT organizational structure had many disadvantages, and so the earliest attention was paid to the improper dislocation of branches and subunits. Formed in the Żagań region, the 1st Department of the BPT was stationed in Sulików for half a year, from April 1946 to move to Lubań Śląski, and the 4th Department formed in Gdańsk to October 1946, stationed in Słupsk, was transferred to Koszalin. The 9th Branch formed in Nowy Sącz was moved to Kraków, and the 5th Branch from Olsztyn to Kętrzyn. The newly formed 12 Division, residing in Sopot until autumn 1946, was moved to Gdańsk. The Border Protection Inspectorate department and border protection units were reorganized in September 1946. BPT departments in military districts and communication companies for servicing departments were dissolved, subordinating border protection units directly to the BPT Department. Border protection departments were given regional names. The Department formed the Political and Educational Department, the Communications Node and support services. The full-time status of the BPT Department after the reorganization was 96 military and 17 contract employees. On October 1, 1946, the BPT Department assumed the command of protection border units. Supplies remained within military districts. A new 12 BPT branches were established. This branch took over from the 4th Division three section commands - in Lębork, Sopot and Elbląg. The 3rd Division of the OP in Szczecin gave the 4th Division the command of the section in Międzyzdroje, keeping for itself the regions of the Baltic Sea in the vicinity of Świnoujście and the Szczecin Lagoon.Henryk Dominiczak: Zarys historii Wojsk Ochrony Pogranicza 1945-1985. Warszawa: Wojskowa drukarnia w Łodzi, 1985. pp. 60-61 On the southeastern border, the 8th Division in Przemyśl took over the command of the section from the 9th Division 38 and 39. New names have been established for former and reformed BPT branches, mainly originating from their headquarters. =1948-1950= Soldiers at the border post No.158 on the border with the German Democratic Republic, near Pieńsk, Lusatian BPT Brigade In 1948 the Chief Inspectorate of Border Protection was formed on the basis of the Border Protection Troops Department.Zenon Jackiewicz: Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza : (1945-1991) : krótki informator historyczny. Kętrzyn: Centrum Szkolenia Straży Granicznej, 1998, p.12 It was subordinated to the Second Deputy Minister of National Defense, General Stanisław Popławski. It consisted of a staff with departments: operational, combat training, organizational and record keeping, border traffic and border conflicts, special communications. In addition, the inspectorate included: Political and Educational Board, Department VII (special), Personnel Department, Quartermaster Inspection Department, Engineering and Sapper Service, Armaments Inspector, Health Department, Communications Node, Prosecutor's Office and Secret Office.Zenon Jackiewicz: Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza : (1945-1991) : krótki informator historyczny. Kętrzyn: Centrum Szkolenia Straży Granicznej, 1998, pp. 12-14 The same order changed the names of the Border Protection Troops branches and subunits: BPT branches were renamed border guard brigades, episode commands into independent border protection battalions, BPT Krosno Command to Krosno independent border protection battalion. The Chief Inspectorate of Border Protection Troops covered twelve border protection brigades, one independent battalion of the Border Protection Troops Training Center and GPK in Okęcie. The supplies of the inspectorate and BPT units were still under the control of the 3rd Deputy Minister of National Defense and military districts.ibid. Maritime unit of the Border Protection Troops in Miłów in the 50s By order of the Minister of National Defense No.205 of December 4, 1948, on January 1, 1949, the Border Protection Troops was subordinated to the Ministry of Public Security.Henryk Dominiczak: Zarys historii Wojsk Ochrony Pogranicza 1945-1985.

Kętrzyn: Centrum Szkolenia Straży Granicznej, 1998, pp. 12-14 This coincided with the deterioration of international relations, and in the country with the beginning of the fight against right-wing nationalist deviation. BPT was included in the ideological fight. Migration and smuggling began to be treated as espionage or diversionary penetration of the borderland by foreign intelligence agents. Imposing such a view of threats by the management of the Ministry of Public Security resulted in far-reaching organizational and structural changes in the BPT. By November 10, 1948, the last border section was filled in the pressure headland. BPT watchtowers were built in Wetlina, Ustrzyki Górne, Stuposiany, Dwernik and Hulsk.Henryk Dominiczak: Zarys historii Wojsk Ochrony Pogranicza 1945-1985. Warszawa: Wojskowa drukarnia w Łodzi, 1985. pp. 65-69 On January 1, 1949, there were 2,673 officer positions at the BPT. 2070 of them were planted. Deficiencies reached about 23%. Officers of peasant (40.6%) and workers (37.5%) were the largest group of soldiers. 79% of the soldiers were conscripts of the Polish People's Army, 16% of the pre-war Polish Army, while the remaining 5% were citizens of the USSR and officers of the Soviet Armed Forces. In September 1949, port security battalions were formed, changing the system of border protection in their area and including fishing traffic under constant control. During this period, sections of the border protected by the OP brigades were corrected and corresponded to the borders of Voivodeships, and sections of independent OP battalions to the borders of the poviats. This was to improve cooperation between the Home Army troops and powiat and voivodeship party organs, Public Security Service and public administration.Grzegorz Goryński.

The Memorial was designed by the Czech architect František Lydie Gahura.  History  Thomas Bata Memorial is the most impressive architectural work of František Lydie Gahura, it is a modern paraphrase of the constructions of high gothic style period: the supporting system and colourful stained glass and the reinforced concrete skeleton and glass. The building process started in 1932 and the monument was open with ceremony on the day of the first anniversary of Tomas Bata death that is on 12th July 1933. Based on the proposals by František Lydie Gahura the monument was meant to be an entrance gate to a complex of four buildings of the learning institute. Between 1936-1939 only the Learning Institute I. and II. were built. In 1954 the monument was rebuilt (academic architect J. Staša) and turned into the House of Arts. Later to be used as an art gallery and philharmonic orchestra in Zlín. The memorial unfortunetly lost its architectural qualities.  Architecture  Thomas Bata Memorial is the most valuable monument of the Zlín functionalism. The idea for the monument is simple - an empty prism placed on a visible spot above the town on the central axis of the ascending park space, made up of several modules of the Zlín 6.15 x 6.15 m frame and clad only with cathedral glass. Inside is Junkers F 13 aircraft in which Tomáš Baťa died in 1932. Gahura reduced the monument to three basic materials of Zlín architecture – concrete, steel and glass. Building’s composition express the unique attributes of Tomáš Baťa: generosity, clarity, aspiration, optimism, simplicity and honesty.

It is the headquarters of Durham County Council. History In the first half of the 20th century Durham County Council was based at the Shire Hall in Durham. After deciding the Shire Hall was inadequate for their needs, county leaders chose to procure a new county headquarters: the site selected had previously been open land forming part of the Aykley Heads Estate which centred around an 18th century mansion that had been built and occupied by the Dixon-Johnson family. Work on the new building began in 1960: it was designed by Sir Basil Spence in the Brutalist style, was built by John Laing & Son at a cost of £2.75 million and was officially opened by the Duke of Edinburgh on 14 October 1963. The design for the seven-storey building involved continuous bands of glazing with exposed concrete beams above and below: a large mosaic mural depicting local scenes was designed by Clayton and Gelson and installed on the face of the building. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber; a memorial to county council staff who had died in the First and Second World Wars was recovered from the Shire Hall and installed outside the new council chamber. Works of art in the building include a painting, long and high, by Norman Cornish, depicting a miners' gala, which is located in the entrance hall. In March 2019, the County Council approved a proposal to move to a smaller facility on the Sands car park at Freeman's Place in the centre of Durham. The works, which are being carried out by Kier Group at a cost of £50 million, are scheduled to be completed in late 2021. The county council also announced plans to move the county archives from County Hall to a new history centre at Mount Oswald.

It was founded in 1816 as a Bergschule (mining school) to train mining officials and mining foremen (Steiger) and, in the 20th century, grew into an engineering college and later a university. It has borne the name of the polymath and mining pioneer Georgius Agricola since 1995. Today, the institution offers 14 bachelor's and master's degree courses in the fields of geological resources and process engineering, mechanical engineering, materials sciences, electrical engineering and information technology as well as industrial engineering. During the 2017/2018 winter semester, there were roughly 2,500 students enrolled on courses at THGA, of which around 55% had registered for a part-time degree. One of the main areas of focus of THGA is research into post-mining.  History  THGA main building The origins of the present-day university date back to 1816, when the Prussian mining authority set up the “Märkische Bergschule” (mining school) in Bochum with the aim of training foreman and other mining officials for their new roles in the up-and-coming mining industry in the Ruhr Valley region.Kretschmann/Düppe: 1816–2016. Die Geschichte der Technischen Hochschule Georg Agricola. p 18. In 1864, the newly founded Westphalian Mining Trade Fund, Westfälische Berggewerkschaftskasse (WBK), became the responsible body for the school.Kretschmann/Düppe: 1816–2016. Die Geschichte der Technischen Hochschule Georg Agricola. p 36 f. Under the leadership of Hugo Schultz, the Bochum mining school experienced a dramatic upsurge from 1868 onwards: the number of students doubled to more than 100 by the end of the century, such that new school premises were opened in 1899, which included the laboratories of the WBK research facilities.Kretschmann/Düppe: 1816–2016. Die Geschichte der Technischen Hochschule Georg Agricola. p 60 f. Alongside the training of foreman, the mining school took on other duties such as preparing mine drawings and undertaking academic surveys, resulting in the opening of Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum (German Mining Museum, Bochum) in 1930 on the basis of scientific and technical collections from the college.Kretschmann/Düppe: 1816–2016. Die Geschichte der Technischen Hochschule Georg Agricola. p 94 ff. Following World War II, the college's profile changed as a result of the coal crisis which took hold in 1958. Whereas the need for qualified miners fell, the demand for higher qualifications increased. Consequently, the mining school initially became the Ingenieurschule für Bergwesen (Engineering School for Mining) in 1963, followed by a conversion to the Fachhochschule Bergbau (University of Mining) in 1971. In 1995, the university was renamed the Technische Fachhochschule Georg Agricola. A new presidential constitution was passed in 2006 and, one year later, all Diplom courses were converted into the bachelor's/master's system in accordance with the Bologna Process. Plans devised by the then regional parliament of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia to merge the university with the state-run FH Bochum (Bochum University of Applied Sciences) were scrapped after student protests in 2012.Kretschmann/Düppe: 1816–2016. Die Geschichte der Technischen Hochschule Georg Agricola. p 166 f. With the support of the RAG-Stiftung, the Research Institute of Post-Mining was set up and new degree courses introduced. To mark the 200th anniversary in April 2016, the institution was once again renamed Technische Hochschule Georg Agricola.  Organisational structure  Since 1 January 1990, the university's governing body has been DMT-Gesellschaft für Lehre und Bildung mbh (DMT-LB), which also maintains the adjacent German Mining Museum in conjunction with the city of Bochum. DMT-LB emerged in 1990 as one of two subsidiaries of the association Deutsche Montan Technologie für Rohstoff, Energie und Umwelt e. V. (DMT e. V.), which, in turn, arose from the merger of Westfälische Berggewerkschaftskasse with a series of similar organisations, the aim being to consolidate the educational and research activities of the entire German coal mining industry.Kretschmann/Düppe: 1816–2016. Die Geschichte der Technischen Hochschule Georg Agricola. p 160. THGA is led by a six-strong executive committee, which includes not only the President, Jürgen Kretschmann, but also a vice president responsible for the budget and administration and three vice presidents for each of the faculties. The Research Institute of Post-Mining is also represented by a vice president.  Faculties and degree courses  THGA Students THGA is split into three faculties, which currently offer eight bachelor's and six master's degree courses in total. Teaching and learning are designed to be of practical relevance, with some 80 per cent of dissertations exploring topics relevant to a company. The majority of courses are also available on a part-time basis. Since 2018, it has also been possible to graduate from the master's programmes with the title “European Engineer” (Eur Ing).

Research Institute of Post-Mining  FZN laboratory The Research Institute of Post-Mining (FZN) was set up in 2015 with financial assistance from RAG-Stiftung and state/EU grants. As the only research institute of its kind anywhere in the world, it carries out research into the so-called perpetual obligations associated with coal mining (pit water management, the renovation of disused collieries), the conversion of former mining sites for commercial/recreational use and the development potential of former mining areas. This also includes the development of cutting-edge systems to monitor the consequences of mining using special deep-water probes and remote sensing data. The interdisciplinary team comprises experts from the fields of mining, geology, geotechnology, hydrogeology, electrical engineering/information technology and mine surveying. It is intended to make the combined knowledge from the areas of mining and post-mining available in a dedicated database. Students can enrol on the world's only Geo-Engineering and Post-Mining master's programme, which offers a combination of natural sciences and technology. The programme's curriculum covers not only rock mechanics and economic geology, but hydrology, surveying and legal issues too. The Head of the Research Institute is Professor Christian Melchers (last updated: 2019). The Institute also has a special professorship for “Geo-Monitoring in Mining and Post-Mining” endowed by the RAG-Stiftung. This post has been held by Professor Tobias Rudolph since May 2019.  Projects and partnerships  THGA is engaged in numerous collaborative projects with partners outside academia. It supports, for instance, initiatives to encourage young people to become the first members of their family to go to university. As part of its “third mission”, THGA launched a special study programme in 2016 for people from refugee backgrounds. (https://www.thga.de/die-th/zentrale- einrichtungen/international-office/fluechtlingsinitiative/) This programme combines language acquisition, specialist qualifications and integration. The programme is supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the RAG-Stiftung and runs in close cooperation with regional job centres. In 2017, a Competence Empowerment Centre (CEC) was set up for the purpose of vocational training and integration. In 2017, people with a refugee background accounted for 5.2 per cent of THGA, making the institution unique within Germany. A further component of the “third mission” is the Dual Career Network Ruhr (DCN Ruhr), of which THGA is the founder member. This network helps partners of newly appointed academics to get their careers off the ground in the region. The DCN is coordinated by the Mercator Research Center Ruhr (MERCUR). Since 2017, THGA has been involved in the “Karrierewege FH-Professur” (“Career paths for professorships at universities of applied sciences”) throughout the region. Over a three-year grant period, participants are given the opportunity to combine real-world professional experience outside academia with teaching and research experience within a university of applied sciences. They work at both a programme-leading institution and an external company. In the Hidden Champions3 project, master craftspeople, technicians and similar specialists at SMEs are trained as skilled professionals and executives in part-time degree courses running alongside their day jobs. THGA is involved in Netzwerk UniverCity Bochum, which seeks to strengthen the affinity of the local population with the city's scientific institutions. The network comprises the nine universities in the city of Bochum, the academic support body (AKAFÖ), the Chamber of Industry and Commerce for the central Ruhr Valley (IHK Mittleres Ruhrgebiet), Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum (German Mining Museum) and Bochum Marketing GmbH.

He is Director of Research Emeritus at the CNRS and a member of the French Academy of Sciences.  Biography  Jean-Claude Duplessy, a former student of the Ecole Normale Supérieure (Ulm), a physics graduate, is a geochemist. His work has contributed to a better understanding of how the ocean has functioned over the recent history of the Earth. He is a recognized pioneer in rebuilding ocean dynamics through the use of carbon isotopes and foraminiferous shell oxygen in marine sediments.Duplessy J.C.,,et al., « Carbon-13 records of benthic foraminifera in the last interglacial ocean: implications for the carbon cycle and the global deep water circulation », Quaternary Research, 1984, 21, p. 225-243Duplessy J.C., et al., « Response of global deep-water circulation to earth's climatic change 135,000-107,000 years ago. », Nature, 1985, 316, p. 500-507 He was one of the first to see the importance of a high quality chronology for a reliable interpretation of measurements related to climate variations in the Earth's past.  Scientific work  He began his research just as the foundations of isotopic geochemistry were beginning to be well established through the work of Harold Urey and Cesare Emiliani in Chicago. The analysis of stable isotopes and natural radioactive elements makes it possible to approach the study of major biogeochemical cycles in an original way and to reconstruct changes in the Earth's climate and environment by applying current principles.Labeyrie L.D., et al., « Changes in the oceanic 13C/12C ratio during the last 140,000 years : high latitude surface water records », Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 1985, 50, p. 217-240 Jean-Claude Duplessy initially focused on the concretions of the caves and demonstrated that they were good recorders of the hydrological cycle and air temperature at the time they were formed. He obtained the first reconstructions of air temperatures and climatic conditions in the south of France for the last millennia and for the previous interglacial periodDuplessy J.C., Let al., « Continental climatic variations between 130,000 and 90,000 years B.P », Nature, 1970, 226, p. 631-633 Recently, this type of study has been resumed in Europe due to the development of new dating methods and the study of stalagmites seems open to a great future. Duplessy turned to the ocean because of its role as a climate regulator and its major impact on biogeochemical cycles, particularly the carbon cycle. His doctoral thesis work has focused on the geochemistry of stable carbon isotopes in the sea.Duplessy J.C., La géochimie des isotopes stables du carbone dans la mer, Université de Paris VI, Thèse de doctorat ès Sciences Physiques, 21 juin 1972 He showed how the distribution of the stable heavy carbon isotope, carbon-13, was governed by biological fractionations related to chlorophyll assimilation by phytoplankton, then by ocean circulation and finally, to a lesser extent, by gas exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere. All these phenomena, which dominate the carbon cycle in the ocean, are now being taken into account to study the fate of carbon dioxide emitted by human activities. Duplessy led numerous oceanographic campaigns and showed that variations in the isotopic composition of fossil foraminifera present in the sediments of the various oceans made it possible to reconstruct changes in the isotopic composition of the ocean and ocean circulation on a large scale, which opened a new scientific field, paleo-oceanography.Duplessy J.C., et al., « Differential isotopic fractionation in benthic foraminifera and paleotemperatures reassessed », Science, 1970, 168, p. 250-251 This has grown to the point where there is now an international journal devoted to this discipline, of which he was one of the first associate editors. He established the first reconstructions of the deep ocean circulation during the height of the last ice age and during the last interglacial period. This has led him to highlight a disruption in the functioning of the ocean: the North Atlantic deep water disappears under glacial conditions, accompanied by a general slowdown in large-scale ocean circulation, the intensity of the Gulf Stream and the heat flux transported by the Atlantic Ocean to the coasts of Western Europe.Labeyrie L.D., et al., « Variations in the mode of formation and temperature of oceanic deep waters over the last 125,000 years », Nature, 1987, 327, p. 477-482 The deep waters of the world ocean are formed by convection and diving of dense surface waters during winter periods. To understand the causes of changes in deep ocean circulation, it was necessary to develop a method to reconstruct not only the temperature (which was already known), but also the salinity of surface waters in the past. Duplessy has developed a method based on fractionations that affect stable oxygen isotopes during the water cycle. This has allowed him to reconstruct the salinity of the Atlantic Ocean during the last glacial maximum with sufficient accuracy for major modelling groups to use this data to simulate global ocean circulation using general ocean circulation models.Duplessy J. C. et a, « Surface salinity reconstruction of the North Atlantic Ocean during the last glacial maximum », Oceanologica Acta, 1991, 14, p. 311-324 These results have provided the basis for understanding ocean circulation in glacial climates and the role that the ocean can play in disrupting climate, as outlined in a book written for the general public entitled \\"When the ocean gets angry \\".Duplessy J. C., Quand l'océan se fâche, Histoire naturelle du climat, Paris, Editions Odile Jacob, 1996 He is also the co-author of \\"Gros temps sur la planète \\",Duplessy Jean-Claude, Morel Pierre, Gros temps sur la planète, Paris, éditions Odile Jacob, 1990 \\"Paléoclimatologie : Tome 1,Jean-Claude Duplessy et Gilles ramstein, Paléoclimatologie : Tome 1, Trouver, dater et interpréter les indices, Paris, 2 décembre 2013 and Tome 2 \\"Paléoclimatologie : Tome 2, Emboiter les pièces du puzzle : comprendre et modéliser un système complexe \\".Jean-Claude Duplessy et Gilles Ramstein, Paléoclimatologie : Tome 2, Emboiter les pièces du puzzle : comprendre et modéliser un système complexe, Paris, 2 décembre 2013 Chronology plays an essential role in understanding the evolution of climates and the links with astronomical theory initiated by Dr. Milankovitch and developed by André Berger in Louvain-La-Neuve and John Imbrie at Brown University. Duplessy launched the first accelerator mass spectrometry laboratory, one of the objectives of which is the fine measurement of carbon-14 to date marine sediments.Duplessy J.C., et al., « Direct dating of the oxygen-isotope record of the last deglaciation by14C accelerator mass spectrometry », Nature, 1986, 320, p. 350-352 With his collaborators, he was able to provide the first evidence of a ten-degree change in seawater temperature in times compatible with human life. These results were confirmed and further refined by the study of drilling in Greenland ice. Today, rapid climatic variations are recognized as a major feature of climate change.Bard E., et al., « Retreat velocity of the North Atlantic Polar front during the last deglaciation determined by means of 14C accelerator mass spectrometry », Nature, 1987, 328, p. 791-794 While developing this research and a group of marine paleoclimatology, he has endeavoured to bring to light in France the study of biogeochemical cycles within the surface envelopes of our planet. With the support of the CNRS, he launched the program to study the flow of matter in the ocean. This programme would bring together the actions of biologists, chemists and geochemists by highlighting the fundamental role of the coupling between biology and geochemistry, which led to the now recognized notion of biogeochemistry. This effort led the French teams to initiate, with their American and European colleagues, the International Joint Global Ocean Flux Study program to quantify carbon fluxes in the ocean and the role of plankton-produced particulate matter transfer in supplying the deep ocean environment with carbon, food and energy.thejointglobaloceanfluxstudy.4.1b8ae20512db692f2a680009040.html « »The joint global ocean flux study By the late 1980s, it had become clear that understanding living conditions on the Earth's surface required studying the couplings between the geosphere and living things. At the request of COFUSI (Comité français des unions scientifiques internationales), Duplessy chaired the French scientific committee of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. He federated research on the physical, chemical and biological mechanisms that govern the evolution of our environment. This research program initiated the study of the variability of the coupled geosphere-biosphere system, giving high priority to palaeoclimatic and palaeo-environmental reconstructions over geological time. These studies have thus made it possible to highlight phenomena as unexpected as the great variability of the carbon cycle in relation to changes in vegetation. These themes will become increasingly important in the coming years in the study of human-induced climate change, as the future evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations can only be realistically simulated if the interactions between the biosphere and biogeochemical cycles are well understood, so that they can be taken into account in models simulating the behaviour of the \\"Earth\\" system. The last interglacial period of 120,000 years, often taken as an analogue of a significantly warmer climate than today, reflects major changes in global ocean temperature and circulation that have contributed to destabilizing the West Antarctic ice cap.Duplessy, J.C., et al., « The deep ocean during the last interglacial period », Science, 2007, 316, p. 89-91  Honours and Awards  * Jean-Claude Duplessy was one of the lead authors of the \\"paleoclimatology\\" chapter of the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was published in 2007. * His mission was to coordinate the activities of some twenty scientists from the international community with the objective of showing how the study of ancient climates makes it possible to better understand the mechanisms that could come into play in a world whose climate is disrupted by greenhouse gas and dust emissions.

The device is 16 channel step frequency receiver and a low-frequency waveform receiver that can measure electron density. The PWS uses the two long antenna in a V-shape on the spacecraft, which are also used by another instrument on the spacecraft. The instrument recorded data about the Solar system's gas giants, and about the outer reaches of the Heliosphere, and beyond. In the 2010s the PWS was used to play the \\"sounds of interstellar space\\" as the spacecraft can sample the local interstellar medium after they departed the Sun's heliosphere. The heliosphere is a region essentially under the influence of the Sun's solar wind, rather than the local interstellar environment, and is another way of understanding the Solar system in comparison to the objects gravitationally bound (e.g in orbit) around Earth's Sun. The PWS instrument plan was introduced in 1974 during the development of the Voyager program. It was hoped it would help increase understanding of wave particle interactions and record data on the magnetospheres of planets like Jupiter and Saturn. The instruments went on to record radio waves at Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

The IVA software interacts over multiple channels, including email and SMS text messages, and in multiple languages. Conversica is a pioneer in providing AI-driven lead engagement software for marketing and sales organizations. Conversica is headquartered in Silicon Valley, (Foster City, California).  History  2007: The company was founded by Ben Brigham in Bellingham, Washington as AutoFerret.com. The company initially produced a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) product, targeted at automotive dealerships. This soon expanded to lead generation, and then lead validation and qualification. The AI for which Conversica is known today was born out of a need to follow-up on and filter out low-quality leads, and in time it was clear that this was where the real value of the product lay. The focus of the company shifted toward this automated lead engagement technology. 2010: The Company started commercially selling AVA, the first Automated Virtual Assistant for sales, and the company name is changed to AVA.ai®. Early customers for AVA are automotive dealerships. and subsequent history of the company has been iteration and refinement of the AI-lead interaction. As the company moved away from generating leads themselves, and providing the CRM themselves, it became necessary to integrate with existing CRMs and Marketing Automation platforms, such as DealerSocket, VinSolutions and Salesforce. 2013: Company raises $16m Series A funding, lead by Kennet Partners, names Mark Bradley as CEO of AVA.ai.

Aghanashini is a village to be found at the mouth of the river. The river Aghanashini originates at 'Shankara Honda' in the Sirsi town of Uttara Karnataka. It is one of the virgin rivers of the world. The water from this river flows unobstructed through the western ghats range and then joins the Arabian Sea.Ashwini Kumar Bhat calls Aghanashini a unique river — untamed, untouched. It is unique because ‘it still flows on the same course as it was thousands of years ago due to the absence of any dams to change its flow’. He calls it untamed as there are no industries along its path. Nobody had even documented it from its origin to its point of joining the sea. The team wanted to document the river from four perspectives: Its origin and history; environment and rich biodiversity along the river and its valley; human dependency on the river, both upstream and downstream; cultures and rituals that developed over time around the river. They claim, “We have carried out an extensive study and a lot of discussions with resource persons to arrive at a set of stories via which we would be telling the story of the river - from its origin till it meets the sea. The stories chosen are unique ones, some of which are found nowhere else in the world and some of which are being told for the first time.” It’s a crowd-funded film. It was a one-and-a-half year’s project and starting in November 2015 and completing in April 2017, the team invited public support and received Rs 3, 53,001. They closed the campaign on January 22, 2017. The film is being screened today at the Moving Waters’ Film Festival at Goethe Institute. Its trailers are already uploaded on YouTube. In an appeal, Ashwini Kumar Bhat had explained why they were doing this project. “Our aim is to create a powerful video documentary that would combine spectacular visuals and a gripping narrative to give an idea of how pristine the river is and how beautiful and fragile its basin is.” That was not all. The danger lurking on the side, which may devastatingly come true is the river-linking project. There are talks of diverting a part of Aghanashini, which can prove to be an ecological disaster. Aghanashini runs to a total length of 124 km, but the volume of water it carries is said to be comparable to Kali and Sharavathi. The river-linking project has already been described as “an idea with flaws” and unless people are alerted and they protest to save their rivers, there is no stopping the impending disaster. Making a documentary is one of the best ways to reach out. The documentary Aghanashini does just that. The team says, “With the help of this documentary we want to bring out the importance of the river to that region and the role it plays in the lives of so many families and traditions that depend directly on the river. With the help of this documentary, we aim to connect the general audience to the importance of saving a river ecosystem and showcase how fragile the bond is between the river and the people around it. We see this documentary as an amalgamation of conservation material and an aesthetic storytelling, bringing together to make a long lasting impact on the viewer, some of whom may be policy makers and decision makers. There are several more features to enjoy in the documentary like the ‘moonbow’ that the team shot at Unchalli Falls. I remember the Forest Officer Manjunath, who supervised our shooting there for the film Allama by TS Nagabharana, passionately talking about the river, its breathtaking falls and why it is necessary to protect the area surrounding the falls. The unit tracked 2 km down the steep forest and Manjunath would not allow anybody to even touch a branch. Dhananjaya, who played Allama, said it was an unforgettable experience of his life to be a part of the Unchalli Falls. For cameraman Bhaskar it was an ecstatic moment. When we saw the final shots of the falls, the general comment was that we had the real falls whereas Bahubali had to depend on VFX. Thanks to Ashwini Kumar Bhat and Landscape Wizards, a documentary on Aghanashini is something to look forward to with bated breath. Jayanth Kaikini would be thankful.

It premiered on September 30, 2019, and concluded on March 28, 2020.  Plot  This asadora follows the life and career of Kimiko Kawahara (played as an adult by Erika Toda) pioneering the way for women in the male- dominated field of ceramics in Japan after World War II. The story centres around Shiga Prefecture and the pottery town of Shigaraki. In 1947, 9-year-old Kimiko (played as a child by Yukawa Kawashima) came to Shigaraki from Osaka with her father Joji (played by Kazuki Kitamura), mother Matsu (played by Tomita Tomoko), and two sisters. Joji was fleeing from debt collectors due to a business failure as a result of the war. As they settle into life in rural Shiga, Kimiko, who is very curious, is inspired by the pottery work in Shigaraki. However, initially Kimiko goes to school, takes care of her sisters and helps her mother with the housework. Joji found work in the transport industry, but the Kawahara family was still poor. Because of this, Joji brings a young man named Soichiro Kusama (played by Ryuta Sato) to board in the household. Kimiko finds inspiration from Kusama, who in turn praises her drawing work. Eventually, the debt collectors trace Joji to Shigaraki... As an adult, Kimiko marries another ceramicist and has one son (that later died of leukemia) but continues to pursue her dreams of working in ceramics and seeks to create her own unique style.

NGF cells represent approximately 10% of the total hippocampal inhibitory interneuron population. In terms of morphology, they are comparatively small and have an unusually high presynaptic bouton density. Almost all NGF neurons express neuropeptide Y (NPY) and are commonly positive for other signalling and non-signalling peptides, including reelin, α-actinin 2, COUP-TFII, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). However, populations of NGF cells which do not express NPY have been reported in both cortical layer I and the striatum. Developmentally, in the cortex, all NGF cells are derived from caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) but NGF cells of the hippocampus have their origins within both the CGE and the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Functionally, NGF cells are GABAergic and their function in the mature brain is inhibition. However, they are suspected to signal more through volume transmission as opposed to the typical chemical synapse. One study found that approximately 78% of neurogliaform cell boutons did not form classical synapses and also indicated that their synaptic boutons are at a larger than usual distance from their target dendrites. Taken together, this and other observations has led to the consensus that NGF cells are likely not involved primarily with “point to point” synaptic transmission but release GABA in a target independent, cloud-like manner to generate a non specific form of inhibitory control (volume transmission).

It is co-produced by Ronnie Screwvala and Ashi Dua under their production banner RSVP Movies and Flying Unicorn Entertainment respectively. The film features an ensemble cast including Mrunal Thakur, Avinash Tiwary, Janhvi Kapoor, Raghuvir Yadav, Sobhita Dhulipala, Vijay Varma and Pavail Gulati. It was released on Netflix on January 1, 2020. Ghost Stories is the third of three anthology films from Johar, Banerjee, Akhtar and Kashyap, being preceded by Bombay Talkies in 2013 and Lust Stories in 2018, the latter also being released on Netflix.  Synopsis  = Story 1 - directed by Zoya Akhtar = Sameera (Janhvi Kapoor), a young nurse, arrives to take care of an ailing bedridden old lady, Mrs. Malik (Surekha Sikri) in a desolate house. The former is needy, clutching at a reluctant lover Guddu (Vijay Varma); the latter, a stunner in her time. The son is supposed to be taking care of the old mother for the duration between the change of nurses, but he is not around. Mrs. Malik tells Sameera that her son is sleeping in the next room, but no one is there. Later, it is found out that the son never turned up and she died due to starvation three days back. = Story 2 - directed by Anurag Kashyap = Set in what feels like 90's Britain with a heavily desaturated look that borders on monochrome, the story revolves around a paranoid, pregnant woman Neha (Sobhita Dhulipala) who babysits her late sister's kid, Ansh (Zachary Braz). The obsessive affection of a kid and paranoia of a childless young woman assumes terrifying proportions. Neha at one point loses sight of what is real and what is her nightmare. A curse of the past triggers her into meltdown and another miscarriage. What we don't know is whether the child- Ansh was involved in making that happen. = Story 3 - directed by Dibakar Banerjee = A man (Sukant Goel) arrives in a small town, Bees-ghara to find it empty, except for a boy and girl. He's told that everyone has been eaten by the girl's father, who is the councilman of Sau-ghara, the big town. At first, the man refuses to believe the person, and when he tries to go out, is met with a zombie woman who attacks him. The boy rescues him, and back in the safe house, he decides to save the children and alert the local authorities. When he gets out and enters a school, he sees the principal behaving strangely. The principal suddenly runs away. The children explain that some people, in order to save themselves from getting eaten, started eating others too as the creatures do not eat those who also eat human flesh. As the man watches, the school principal screams and convulses on the ground. The girl's father, who resembles a hairy bear-like creature enters their room. The creature, who has poor vision, is unable to detect the presence of the man and the children until the girl, overcome with love for her father, goes near him, only to be killed and eaten by him. The other two, stunned, don't move for a day, and the monster leaves. The boy has an idea that they take the blood from the girl's remains and cover their faces with it so that the zombies will believe that they too are zombies and let them go. The entire place is under surveillance by the girl's father and upon seeing the pair, he checks them personally. He grows suspicious of the boy, who in reaction, eats some of the flesh of the girl. The monster turns to the man, who holds himself, but gets scared and starts running, resulting in him being chased by the zombies. On the way, he falls into a trap. He is thrown the girl's hand, so that he can demonstrate he is one of them. The man refuses to do so, and screams as the girl's father pounces on him, only to wake up from what is supposedly a dream. The man is then confused as he wakes up in the same trap he fell into, and runs towards Bees-ghara. Finding the place deserted and burning, he assumes the worst and cries that he failed to save the children. At the same time, a car comes, full of people who resembled the earlier zombies. The man is taken by them and they tell him that they are people of Sau-ghara and that nobody lives in Bees-ghara after they burned it down because it was a very inferior place. = Story 4 - directed by Karan Johar = Ira (Mrunal Thakur) agrees to have an arranged marriage with the handsome and wealthy Dhruv (Avinash Tiwary) who dwells in a house his grandmother built. On the first night after her wedding, she sees her husband seemingly talking to the grandmother who died 20 years ago. Each night after that, the grandmother comes to bid good night to Dhruv, who seems to be the only one who can see her. In spite of being an adult, he enjoys playing peek-a-boo with the dead grandmother. Ira questions the maid Shanti (Heeba Shah), and learns that when Dhruv was playing peek-a-boo with her, he accidentally pushed her down the stairs. The grandmother was severely incapacitated and in terrible pain. Despite this, she would make it a point to visit Dhruv each night to wish him a good night. The conversation ends before Ira can learn the circumstances of the grandmother's passing. One night Ira gets tired of Dhruv's attachment to his dead grandmother and storms into her room, still preserved as a shrine her, and screams at the grandmother to leave them alone. The next day, at breakfast, Shanti helps Ira stir her oatmeal. Midway through breakfast, Ira starts having severe stomach cramps and is helped to her bed by Shanti. As Ira lies writhing in pain, Shanti completes their earlier conversation, telling Ira that the grandmother had begged Shanti to put an end to her pain. Being the obedient maid that she is, she mixed castor seeds into her breakfast; thereby, poisoning her to death. The viewer is led to understand that Shanti did the same for Ira. Ira wakes up into a brightly lit room and sees the grandmother hovering over her. Confused, Ira asks how it is that she can now see her. She lets Ira know that this is because Ira is now in her world, implying that Ira is dead. Ira then turns her head to see other human forms while the grandmother tells her that those are the others who, like Ira, did not believe in her presence.

Early career He did his secondary studies in Djerba and then went to France to continue his studies in management in 1985, at a time when Jews were particularly threatened: one of his nephews aged 5 died in an anti-Semitic shooting in Djerba. Having dual French and Tunisian nationality, he first manages franchise Franprix supermarkets in Ile-de-France before embarking on tourism. In the 1990s, he founded the tour operator Royal First Travel which specializes in Tunisia. He is also a member of the Ghriba Pilgrimage Commission, manages a four-star hotel in Djerba for ten years and is involved in the Tunisian Hotel Federation. Political career  In 2011, he made a passage through the Party of the Future. On 5 November 2018, during a cabinet reshuffle, the head of the Tunisian government, Youssef Chahed, appointed him to head the Ministry of Tourism to replace Selma Elloumi. The appointment of a Jewish minister is a first since 1957 and the nominations of Albert Bessis and André Barouch. It is the end of 2018 the only Arab country to count a Jewish minister. His appointment creates a controversy and protests occur in the days following it. Hundreds of demonstrators denounce the supposed \\"pro-Zionist positions\\" of René Trablesi. The Tunisian Minority Support Association denounces a campaign of defamation against the new minister. His appointment is, however, welcomed by Tunisian actors and specialists in tourism, who appreciate the arrival of a professional in the sector. On 12 November, MPs put their trust in all the proposed ministers, including Trabelsi, who won 127 votes to 25 and one abstention. In January 2019, another controversy affected him, rumors accusing him of giving a television interview to I24news, an Israeli channel, during which he discusses the Palestinian situation and the possibility of normalization with Israel. He denies this information that the interview, conducted at the request of the Palestinian ambassador in Tunis, was conducted by a Tunisian team for SCOPAL, a British information platform. From September 2019, he sits on the Executive Board of the World Tourism Organization on behalf of Tunisia. Private life René Trabelsi is the son of Perez Trabelsi, chairman of the Jewish Ghriba Committee and leader of the Jewish community in Djerba. Father of three children, he lives between Paris, Djerba and Tunis.

He is well known for being arrested at the 2019 Moscow protests and then falsely accused of assaulting a police officer, despite videographic evidence proving his innocence. He was then sentenced to 3.5 years in prison. This has led to widespread public backlash, from teachers to priests, and has resulted in the Russian courts commuting his prison sentence and granting him parole. Biography Ustinov moved to Moscow after attending school. He graduated in 2017 from Konstantin Raikin's The Higher School of Performing Arts. After graduation, he served with the Russian National Guard and policed the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He has starred in the television series Morozov and has come to star in Fyodor Bondarchuk's film Attraction (2017).  2019 Moscow protests  Ustinov was standing at Pushkin Square in August 2019 as he was surrounded and beaten by riot police amidst the 2019 Moscow protests. The protests were held in response to the rejection of many independent candidates by the Moscow City Election Commission (MCEC) in the 2019 election at Moscow City Duma and were the largest held in Russia after the 2011–2013 Russian protests. He was arrested and held on numerous charges in relation to the mass protests. The Tverskoy District Court found him guilty of dislocating a riot police's shoulder and sentenced him to 3.5 years in prison. However, the court did not review the videos showing Ustinov not participating in the protests nor attacking the police. This ruling rallied a massive backlash from the public, including the city's theatre community, entertainment industry professionals, and the Russian Orthodox Church. The protest campaign to the ruling included director Andrey Zvyagintsev, former presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak, and actors Danila Kozlovsky, Sergey Bezrukov, Maksim Vitorgan and Yelizaveta Boyarskaya. Actor Konstantin Raikin of the Satirikon Theater called it a \\"misunderstanding that could have a tragic end.\\" The Memorial human rights group declared Ustinov a political prisoner. On September 18, 2019, a queue to picket was held outside the Presidential Administration Office. In Russia, only a single person can demonstrate without prior permission. On September 20, 2019, Ustinov was released pending trial, citing his previous military service and personal recommendation from Konstantin Raikin. The prosecutors also changed their stance amidst escalting protests, saying that while they do not dispute Ustinov's guiltiness, they admit that the sentence is too harsh. They had originally asked for six years of prison time. The court also agreed to review video at the later trial. His case was later commuted to a one-year suspended sentence, granting him parole, by an appeal court.
