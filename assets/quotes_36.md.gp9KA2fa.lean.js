According to official lists, Horbaczewski was the third highest scoring Polish fighter ace, with 16.5 confirmed kills (16 individual and one shared) and one probable kill. He was awarded several decorations, among others Virtuti Militari IV class (posthumously) and V class, four times Polish Cross of Valour, Distinguished Service Order (posthumously) and Distinguished Flying Cross (twice). Biography Horbaczewski was born in Kiev, but grew up in Brest. At school, he completed a gliding course. In 1938 he entered cadet flying school in Dƒôblin, from which he graduated in 1939. During the Invasion of Poland in 1939 he was made a Podporucznik (2nd Lieutenant) but he saw no combat. He was evacuated through Romania, Yugoslavia and Greece to France. Still without a combat assignment he was then evacuated in June 1940 to Britain. After training on RAF aircraft, on 21 August 1941 he was posted to the Polish No. 303 Squadron, flying the Spitfire Mk.V. He probably shot down his first aircraft, a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, on 6 November over France. His first confirmed kill was a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 on 4 April 1942. He shot down a Bf 109 on 16 April and a Fw 190 on 19 August. In February 1943 he volunteered for the Polish Fighting Team, also known as the \\"Skalski's Circus\\", attached to the Desert Air Force. Fighting from March 1943 in the Tunisia Campaign, the flight were attached to No. 145 Squadron RAF. On 28 March he shot down a Junkers Ju 88, then four Bf 109's (on 2 April, 6 April, and two on 22 April). On 6 April his Spitfire Mk.IX was hit and started burning, but as he prepared to jump the wind extinguished the fire and he managed to land on an airfield. Remaining in Africa after the Flight was disbanded he was transferred to No. 601 Squadron, prior to becoming a flight commander in No. 43 Squadron RAF. He commanded the flight from May 1943 then in August he became a Squadron Leader (being one of three Poles commanding British squadrons). He fought with No. 43 squadron over Malta, Sicily and Italy. On 4 September he shot down a Fw 190 and on 16 September two more. In October he handed over command and returned to Britain. On 16 February 1944 Horbaczewski took command of the Polish No. 315 Squadron, flying the new P-51 Mustang Mk. III. On 12 June 1944 he shot down a Fw 190, and on 30 July one Bf 109 individually and one with his wing man (counted as 0.5 'share'). During this period, he also shot down four V-1 flying bombs. =Death= On 18 August 1944 Horbaczewski led his squadron of 12 aircraft over France on a 'Rodeo' mission, despite being ill with flu. The squadron, using the element of surprise, attacked a group of 60 Fw 190s of Jagdgeschwaders 2 and 26 over an airfield near Beauvais. Horbaczewski quickly shot down three Focke-Wulfs, but went missing during the dogfight. In 1947, the wreck of his Mustang with his body was found crashed near Velennes (Oise).Paul Hamlin, Coolham Airfield Remembered, Private Pressing, Sussex (1996) Exact circumstances are unclear; he was probably shot down in combat by an aircraft of II./JG 26. The squadron was credited with shooting down 16 aircraft in this encounter, with their only loss being the squadron leader (according to German documents, eight Fw 190 of JG 26 and four of JG 2 were destroyed).

Early life Murdoch with Belle and Sebastian in 2010 at the Wang Theatre in Boston Murdoch's parents made him take piano lessons during his childhood, and he claims not to have enjoyed them at the time but now \\"appreciates this decision vastly\\". Apart from early musical activities at secondary school (at age 12 he formed a band with fellow pupils, in which he played piano), Murdoch first became publicly involved in music as a radio DJ for Subcity Radio at the University of Glasgow. Whilst at university at the end of the 1980s, he became ill with myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue syndrome, and was unable to work for seven years. Murdoch said that the isolation of these years is what led to his becoming a songwriter: \\"That was a big desert at the time, a kind of vacuum in my life. From that, these songs started coming out, these melodies where I could express what I was feeling.\\" By early 1995 Murdoch had largely recovered from his illness and began to look for fellow musicians to form a band, which became Belle & Sebastian. Murdoch's struggle with chronic fatigue syndrome is the subject of the song \\"Nobody's Empire\\" on Belle & Sebastian's album Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance. Influence of religion This was also when he began living above a church hall and working as its caretaker, a position he maintained until 2003. In 2004 Murdoch told The Guardian, \\"I'm not actually a Christian with a capital C. I'm still asking questions. But I had this time when I found myself singing all these old hymns in my kitchen and I couldn't work out why I was doing it. Then one Sunday morning I got up, looked at my watch, and thought, 'I wonder if I could make it to a church service?' It was so welcoming. It just felt like you were coming home. Twelve years later, I've never left\\". Murdoch's interest in faith has been perceptible in his lyrics. Belle and Sebastian's first album included lines about \\"reading the Gospel to yourself,\\" and on the second Murdoch sang of \\"the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever.\\" Religious references became more confident and direct on later albums, including \\"If You Find Yourself Caught in Love\\" (which continues \\"say a prayer to the man above\\"; this line becomes a refrain) on the album Dear Catastrophe Waitress and the two-part \\"Act of the Apostle\\" on The Life Pursuit. Of \\"If You Find Yourself Caught in Love,\\" Murdoch told Gross, \\"At the time I was writing it I thought, well, should I be so overt? Because I've often couched any religious overtones within characters in the past, but this is a bit more out there. And then I just thought, come on, you've been doing this for years, why not? Why not just be a bit more straightforward?\\" Sexually ambiguous lyrics in Belle & Sebastian's music have prompted Murdoch to confirm his heterosexuality in the press, calling himself \\"straight to the point of boring myself\\". Personal life Murdoch ran the Glasgow Marathon in 1986, and finished with a time of three hours. Murdoch is a vegetarian.The 2008 World's Sexiest Vegetarians Are‚Ä¶, peta2.com; accessed 15 June 2015. He married longtime girlfriend Marisa Privitera on 26 November 2007 in New York City. Privitera is on the cover of Belle and Sebastian's DVD Fans Only and LP The Life Pursuit. Their eldest son, Denny, was born in May 2013. Second son Nico was born in November 2016. Murdoch was diagnosed with colour blindness at an early age and does not drink. \\"I like a Scotch whisky but I'm allergic to alcohol, would you believe, which is a tragedy in itself,\\" he has said. \\"It's only in the last couple of years. I got eczema and one of the things I had to do to get rid of it was give up alcohol.\\" In 2009 Murdoch contributed the song \\"Another Saturday\\" to the AIDS benefit album Dark Was the Night, produced by the Red Hot Organization. He was one of the most notable protesters attending a 5 December 2009 march in Glasgow supporting governmental intervention to combat climate change, prior to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 in Copenhagen. In 2010 Murdoch published his first memoir, The Celestial Caf√©. In 2012‚Äì2013 he wrote and directed the musical feature film God Help the Girl, released internationally and online in 2014.

Personal life  Sonnac was born to a noble family in the French region of Rouergue. No date of birth survives for the Grand Master. He was described by Matthew Paris as \\"a discreet and circumspect man, who was also skilled and experienced in the affairs of war\\". De Sonnac was an established member of the order before his election as Grand Master. He was the Preceptor of Aquitaine in France for the Templars and arrived in the Holy Land around autumn of 1247, finding \\"the remnants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in a precarious state. Grand Master Armand de P√©rigord had been taken prisoner at the Battle of La Forbie in 1244, and after negotiations for his release failed two years later, De Sonnac was proposed as a replacement. Before his first year in the East was out, he was the order's new leader.  Military record  = The Seventh Crusade = De Sonnac's tenure was a particularly violent one. By 1247, the Christians had lost power bases in Tiberias, Mount Tabor, Belvoir and Ascalon. This prompted a fresh campaign from King Louis IX of France, who landed at Limassol, Cyprus on 17 September 1248. De Sonnac sailed from Acre to meet him and make preparations. Shortly after, the new Grand Master received an Emir from the Sultan, offering the crusaders a peace deal. De Sonnac related this to the French King, who ordered him to cease any negotiations without gaining Royal permission first. This ensured the new campaign would be concluded with violence, not diplomacy. = The Siege Of Damietta = On 5 June 1249, the French crusader army, combined with de Sonnac and his Templar knights, attempted to land in Egypt. They targeted Damietta, just as the Fifth Crusade had years earlier. Fighting on the Egyptian beaches was heavy and the King fought in waist-high water alongside the troops. After a prolonged battle, the Muslims were forced to retreat, leaving the city almost undefended. The next day the de Sonnac wrote to Robert of Sandford, telling how on the morning after the battle, Damietta had been seized with only one crusader casualty. At the end of November, de Sonnac and King Louis began their march to Cairo, via Mansurah. = Battle of Al Mansurah = De Sonnac's next engagement was at the Battle of Mansurah, for the city containing the area's defensive force, the last obstacle to central Egypt. The Muslims had been protected by the swollen Nile, but on 8 February 1250, a local Bedouin showed them where they could cross. De Sonnac, Robert of Artois, the King's brother and William II Longespee, leader of the English troops, launched an assault on the Muslim force without the main Frankish army. Taken by surprise, the Egyptians quickly retreated from the riverbank into the city and the Count foolishly gave chase, outnumbered and with no back-up from the bulk of the French forces. Jean de Joinville claimed that the Count meant to follow on his own and that the rest of the raiding party did so as to not look cowardly. The Templars \\"thought that they would be dishonored if they allowed the Count to go before them\\".John of Joinville However, another source, Matthew Paris, reported that de Sonnac was forced into the assault by the Count. Robert was \\"bellowing and swearing disgracefully as is the French custom\\",Matthew Paris and blaming the Templars and other religious orders for causing the real downfall of the Kingdom. Disgusted, de Sonnac returned to his men and prepared to chase down the numerically superior enemy. Whatever the fact, the three commanders charged into Mansurah with tired men and no reinforcements and were quickly drawn into heavy fighting. Completely surrounded, \\"like an island in the sea\\", de Sonnac refused to surrender and his Templars fought to the last man. Earl Longespee was killed in the fighting, and the Count either fell in combat or drowned fleeing to safety. De Sonnac's escape from the city would make him a famous warrior, when many had considered him more suited to diplomacy. With heavy wounds, only one eye and two remaining knights of the original 280, he fought through the Egyptian army and out of the city, where he found the main Frankish army. He refused to rest and after receiving medical attention he returned and helped repulse a Muslim raiding party. = Battle of Fariskur = The Christian forces camped outside the city and were under constant attack. A major assault was launched by the Muslims on 6 April and de Sonnac joined the Frankish charge to meet the enemy. He fought along the riverbank until he was finally overwhelmed by the attackers. Blinded fully by a second injury to the head, he was hacked down and killed by Muslim troops. His death and the capture of Louis IX marked an end to the seventh crusade. He was succeeded as Grand Master by Renaud de Vichiers.  Chronicler  De Sonnac was the first Grand Master to formally record the intricacies of the Templar hierarchy. He added this to existing archives, codified them and stored them in a safe place so that the order would have accurate records in future years. It is certainly ironic that, for a man responsible for creating the order's most in-depth records, there is no indication of when he was born.http://www.templiers.org/guillaumesonnac- eng.php  In fiction  Guillaume de Sonnac is a prominent character in Crusades, a graphic novel by Izu, Alex Nikolavitch, and Zhang Xiaoyu, published by Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, in which he is show as a power hungry plotter.

Personal details  Gilbert Horal was born an Aragonese (from the Kingdom of Aragon in modern-day Spain), and entered the Templars at a young age. He stayed in the provinces of Provence and Aragon, where he took part in the battles of the Reconquista on the Iberian Peninsula, and became Grand Master of the province until 1190. Then he became the Grand Preceptor of France, and in 1193, after the death of Robert de Sabl√©, he became Grand Master of the Order. In 1194, Pope Celestine III gave the Templars more privileges. Horal was known for wanting peace between the Christians and the Muslims, though some disagreed and thought that this showed treason and collusion with the enemy. During his leadership, the quarrel between the Templars and Hospitaliers increased. The arbitration of Pope Innocent III was in favour of the Hospitaliers because the Pope could not forgive the Templars for making the agreements that they had with Malek-Adel, brother of Saladin. Another of Gilbert Horal's accomplishments was that he took the time to organize and consolidate the possessions of the Templars in France and Apulia. In Spain, the Templars took an active part in the Reconquista, and in 1196 were given the fortress of Alfambra by Alfonso II of Aragon as a reward for their efforts in the battles.

It was similar in size, capacity, and cost with Apple's iPod Mini which debuted earlier the same year. This was Rio's second player to use a miniature hard disk for storage, after the Rio Nitrus, which was first to market with a 1.5 GB drive in late 2003. History Rio Avalon unreleased model The Carbon was announced on August 2, 2004. The first 500 Carbons were produced as a Limited Edition with a unique serial number (1-500) that was laser engraved into the polished steel (back) side of the player. The initial Carbon was silver with a 5 GB drive and retailed US $249.99, same as the iPod Mini with 4 GB. An off-white version called the Carbon Pearl was next, with a 5GB drive at first and then a 6 GB drive later as the price of Microdrives fell. This was followed by the 2.5 GB ce2100 (black) and ce2110 (light green) which offered reduced features and cost. An 8 GB model with a colour screen was planned, code-named Avalon, but was never produced due to the demise of Rio in August 2005. Rio officially exited the portable music player market in August 2005 and is no longer providing firmware updates for the players. The last officially released version of the firmware (1.95) supports subscription-based and purchased PlaysForSure licenses. A previously unreleased version of Rio Carbon firmware, called \\"The Developer's Cut\\", was released in January 2006 by enthusiasts, and offers several new and updated features. Features The Carbon features a microphone and a bidirectional wheel, which is used for scrolling and adjusting volume, along with a 5-way navigation pad. It is small in size (82 x 61 x 13 millimeters) and weigh 3.2 ounces, and is powered by a non-removable rechargeable lithium ion battery that has up to 20 hours of playback time. The wheel is notched. Either the 5-way navigation pad or the scroll wheel and the menu button can be used independently to navigate through menus or they can be used together. The two have different behaviors, and are therefore complementary, not redundant. Since the wheel is used for navigation as well as volume control, one must leave the menu to adjust the volume. The Carbon can play MP3 and WMA audio files as well as Audible.com audiobook files. It is Microsoft Windows, Linux and Macintosh compatible, since it is usable as a USB mass storage device. It is also PlaysForSure compatible. Other features include: * 5 GB of storage on a 1\\" microdrive * 5-band equalizer with several presets * Built-in microphone for voice recording * USB mass storage device compatible, allowing for simple drag-and-dropping of files * Built-in rechargeable battery offers up to 20 hours music playback * Charge from the USB port or the included power adapter * Windows and Mac compatible (the player itself is Linux compatible as well, but not the included software) * Includes Rio Music Manager software to manage the digital music library * Can carry non-audio files like a USB flash drive Included software Included with the purchase of the Rio Carbon and Rio Karma is Rio Music Manager, which can be used to transfer music to the Carbon. It only allows transfer of music files that are totally compatible with the player. Carbonising The Carbon, at the time of its release, had the unique distinction of costing less than one of its own components, its hard disk drive. This distinction led to an activity known by the slang term \\"carbonising,\\" whereby customers purchase a Rio Carbon, only to dismantle it and sell the disk drive for a net profit. ce2100/2110 The Rio ce2100 is a relative of the Carbon that features a 2.5 GB hard drive. The ce2100 (sometimes mistakenly referred to as the ce2500), does not have a microphone, but retains the microphone hole since it shares the same case as the Carbon. The ce2100 comes in black. The green version has model number ce2110, the only difference being the color of the plastic piece on the front and its limited retail availability (Target and FYE stores only). The ce2100 is also compatible with the \\"Developer's Cut\\" firmware update. Firmware *Version 3.04 supports both MTP and MSC connections. CF Modding The Rio Carbon, along with all of Rio's Microdrive-based players, can be modified to run on Compact Flash cards instead of hard disk. This requires a partial disassembly of the unit, removing the Microdrive, replacing it with a compatible CF card, and then formatting the memory and loading the device firmware. Compatible CF cards must be 8GB or less, and must have TrueATA/TrueIDE mode capability. This mod will increase speed and responsiveness of the player, along with making it more durable and increasing battery life. The 8GB limit is due to the 24-bit addressing in the firmware.

Coral Gables High School and South Dade High School were rivals throughout much of the school's history. History Miami Palmetto was built in 1958. It serves a culturally and socioeconomically diverse population. Miami Palmetto is the home school for the residents of Pinecrest, Palmetto Bay, West Perrine, and Palmetto Estates. The school enjoys strong support from the municipal governments of the two primary areas zoned to Palmetto Senior, the Village of Pinecrest and the Village of Palmetto Bay. Both provide noteworthy cash or in- kind donations and have active Educational Advisory Compact agreements that facilitate working with MDCPS. Pinecrest gives $10,000 to the school every year, and Palmetto Bay in 2015 sponsored a community-wide 5K Color Run fundraiser benefit. An active PTSA also contributes substantial resources (funding, programming, volunteer manpower). The school is slated for a $29 million renovation, with groundbreaking anticipated in fall 2016. Palmetto for years was a three year high school, but after the 1997 addition it expanded to be a four-year high school. In the school's history a few scandals have surfaced, one in which lacrosse players shared racist remarks through a group chat to later be counseled, and an incident where a student stabbed a classmate and her teacher with scissors. Miami Palmetto is currently participating in a pilot program of AP Capstone. School trends =Academics= The diverse curriculum offers a choice of twenty-eight AP courses, and students have the highest pass rate for AP exams in the county.

History Some of Asimov's science fiction short stories and novels predict that this suspicion will become strongest and most widespread in respect of \\"mechanical men\\" that most-closely resemble human beings (see android), but it is also present on a lower level against robots that are plainly electromechanical automatons. The \\"Frankenstein Complex\\" is similar in many respects to Masahiro Mori's uncanny valley hypothesis.MacDorman, K. F. & Entezari, S. O. (2015). Individual differences predict sensitivity to the uncanny valley. Interaction Studies, 16(2), 141‚Äì172. MacDorman, K. F. & Ishiguro, H. (2006a). The uncanny advantage of using androids in cognitive science research. Interaction Studies, 7(3), 297-337. Mori, M. (1970/2012). The uncanny valley (K. F. MacDorman & N. Kageki, Trans.). IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, 19(2), 98‚Äì100. The name, \\"Frankenstein Complex\\", is derived from the name of Victor Frankenstein in the novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley in about the year 1818. In Shelley's story, Frankenstein created an intelligent, somewhat superhuman being, but he finds that his creation is horrifying to behold and abandons it. This ultimately leads to Victor's death at the conclusion of a vendetta between himself and his creation. In much of his fiction, Dr. Asimov depicts the general attitude of the public towards robots as negative, with ordinary people fearing that robots will either replace them or dominate them, although dominance would not be allowed under the specifications of the Three Laws of Robotics, the first of which is: : \\"A robot may not harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\\" However, Asimov's fictitious earthly public is not fully persuaded by this, and remains largely suspicious and fearful of robots. I, Robots short story \\"Little Lost Robot\\" is about this \\"fear of robots\\". In Asimov's robot novels, the Frankenstein Complex is a major problem for roboticists and robot manufacturers. They do all they can to reassure the public that robots are harmless, even though this sometimes involves hiding the truth because they think that the public would misunderstand it. The fear by the public and the response of the manufacturers is an example of the theme of paternalism, the dread of paternalism, and the conflicts that arise from it in Asimov's fiction. The same theme occurs in many later works of fiction featuring robots, although it is rarely referred to as such. Examples of human hostility towards robots have occurred in real life; for example, in an area in which self-driving cars were being tested, the residents vandalized those vehicles. See also *Frankenstein argument - an argument against engineered intelligent beings (but not specifically robots) *Uncanny valley - a hypothesis that posits a gap in emotional response to things created to resemble humans that fall short of perfect mimicry.

He was an adopted son of Cao Cao, a warlord who rose to power in the late Eastern Han dynasty and laid the foundation for Wei. After Cao Cao's death and the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Zhen served under Cao Pi and Cao Rui, the first two emperors of Wei. He is best known for leading a successful defence of Wei from the first two of a series of invasions by Wei's rival state, Shu Han, between 228 and 229. Family background There are two accounts of Cao Zhen's origins. The first, from the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi) and Wei Shu (È≠èÊõ∏; by Wang Chen), claimed that Cao Zhen was a distant younger relative of Cao Cao,(ÊõπÁúüÂ≠óÂ≠ê‰∏πÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÊóèÂ≠ê‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 9. a warlord who rose to power in the late Eastern Han dynasty and controlled the Han central government. Cao Zhen's father, Cao Shao (ÊõπÈÇµ), was a close aide to Cao Cao and was known for his intelligence and loyalty. Around 190, when Cao Cao was raising an army to join the Guandong Coalition, he sent Cao Shao to recruit soldiers from the various commanderies. Huang Wan (ÈªÉÁê¨), the Inspector of Yu Province at the time, plotted to assassinate Cao Cao. Cao Shao sacrificed his life to save Cao Cao.(Â§™Á•ñËµ∑ÂÖµÔºåÁúüÁà∂ÈÇµÂãüÂæíË°ÜÔºåÁÇ∫Â∑ûÈÉ°ÊâÄÊÆ∫„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 9.(È≠èÊõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÈÇµ‰ª•Âø†ÁØ§ÊúâÊâçÊô∫ÔºåÁÇ∫Â§™Á•ñÊâÄË¶™‰ø°„ÄÇÂàùÂπ≥‰∏≠ÔºåÂ§™Á•ñËààÁæ©ÂÖµÔºåÈÇµÂãüÂæíË°ÜÔºåÂæûÂ§™Á•ñÂë®Êóã„ÄÇÊôÇË±´Â∑ûÂà∫Âè≤ÈªÉÁê¨Ê¨≤ÂÆ≥Â§™Á•ñÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÈÅø‰πãËÄåÈÇµÁç®ÈÅáÂÆ≥„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 9. The second account, from the Weilue, mentioned that Cao Zhen's original family name was Qin (Áß¶), and that he was adopted into the Cao family. In this account, Cao Zhen's father was one Qin Bonan (Áß¶‰ºØÂçó), who was a close friend of Cao Cao. Around 195, when Cao Cao was being attacked by soldiers under a rival warlord Yuan Shu, he took shelter in Qin Bonan's house. When the soldiers showed up and asked him where Cao Cao was, Qin Bonan claimed that he was Cao Cao and was killed by the soldiers. Out of gratitude to Qin Bonan for saving his life, Cao Cao adopted his children and allowed them to bear his family name.(È≠èÁï•Êõ∞ÔºöÁúüÊú¨ÂßìÁß¶ÔºåÈ§äÊõπÊ∞è„ÄÇÊàñ‰∫ëÂÖ∂Áà∂‰ºØÂçóÂ§ôËàáÂ§™Á•ñÂñÑ„ÄÇËààÂπ≥Êú´ÔºåË¢ÅË°ìÈÉ®Èª®ËàáÂ§™Á•ñÊîªÂä´ÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÂá∫ÔºåÁÇ∫ÂØáÊâÄËøΩÔºåËµ∞ÂÖ•Áß¶Ê∞èÔºå‰ºØÂçóÈñãÈñÄÂèó‰πã„ÄÇÂØáÂïèÂ§™Á•ñÊâÄÂú®ÔºåËçÖ‰∫ëÔºö„ÄåÊàëÊòØ‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅÇÂÆ≥‰πã„ÄÇÁî±Ê≠§Â§™Á•ñÊÄùÂÖ∂ÂäüÔºåÊïÖËÆäÂÖ∂Âßì„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 9. Service under Cao Cao In any case, Cao Cao took pity on Cao Zhen, adopted him and allowed him to live with one of his own sons, Cao Pi. One day, while Cao Zhen was out hunting, he encountered a ferocious tiger which started chasing him. Cao Zhen turned back and killed the tiger with a single arrow shot.(Â§™Á•ñÂìÄÁúüÂ∞ëÂ≠§ÔºåÊî∂È§äËàáË´∏Â≠êÂêåÔºå‰ΩøËàáÊñáÂ∏ùÂÖ±Ê≠¢„ÄÇÂ∏∏ÁçµÔºåÁÇ∫ËôéÊâÄÈÄêÔºåÈ°ßÂ∞ÑËôéÔºåÊáâËÅ≤ËÄåÂÄí„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 9. Cao Cao was so impressed with Cao Zhen's bravery that he appointed his adopted son as an officer in the elite \\"Tiger and Leopard Cavalry\\" (ËôéË±πÈ®é) of his army. Cao Zhen scored his first victory in battle when he defeated bandits in Lingqiu County (Èùà‰∏òÁ∏£; east of present-day Lingqiu County, Shanxi).

Cao Zhen fought in Hanzhong Commandery against Cao Cao's rival Liu Bei, who had launched a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery from Cao Cao. When Liu Bei sent Wu Lan (Âê≥Ëò≠), one of his officers, to lead troops to garrison at Xiabian County (‰∏ãËæØÁ∏£; northwest of present-day Cheng County, Gansu), Cao Cao ordered his cousin Cao Hong to lead an army to attack the enemy.

When Cao Zhen returned to Chang'an, Cao Cao appointed him as Commandant of the Central Army (‰∏≠È†òËªç). At the time, as his general Xiahou Yuan had been killed in action against Liu Bei's forces at the Battle of Mount Dingjun, Cao Cao was worried that Liu Bei would press on the attack at Yangping Pass (ÈôΩÂπ≥Èóú; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi). He commissioned Cao Zhen as Army Protector Who Attacks Shu (ÂæÅËúÄË≠∑Ëªç) and ordered him and Xu Huang to lead troops to attack Gao Xiang, an officer under Liu Bei, at Yangping Pass. Cao Zhen and Xu Huang defeated Gao Xiang and drove him back. In 219, after a prolonged war against Liu Bei, Cao Cao eventually decided to give up defending Hanzhong Commandery so he withdrew all his forces. During the retreat, he sent Cao Zhen to Wudu Commandery (Ê≠¶ÈÉΩÈÉ°; around present-day Cheng County, Gansu) to meet up with Cao Hong and relay his order for them to retreat to Chencang (Èô≥ÂÄâ; east of present- day Baoji, Shaanxi).(ÂæûËá≥Èï∑ÂÆâÔºåÈ†ò‰∏≠È†òËªç„ÄÇÊòØÊôÇÔºåÂ§è‰æØÊ∑µÊ≤íÊñºÈôΩÂπ≥ÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÊÜÇ‰πã„ÄÇ‰ª•ÁúüÁÇ∫ÂæÅËúÄË≠∑ËªçÔºåÁù£ÂæêÊôÉÁ≠âÁ†¥ÂäâÂÇôÂà•Â∞áÈ´òË©≥ÊñºÈôΩÂπ≥„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñËá™Ëá≥Êº¢‰∏≠ÔºåÊãîÂá∫Ë´∏ËªçÔºå‰ΩøÁúüËá≥Ê≠¶ÈÉΩËøéÊõπÊ¥™Á≠âÈÇÑÂ±ØÈô≥ÂÄâ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 9.

Cao Pi appointed Cao Zhen as General Who Guards the West (ÈéÆË•øÂ∞áËªç) and ordered him to supervise military operations in Yong and Liang provinces in western China.

The Wei forces attacked and besieged Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ; present-day Jiangling County, Hubei), which was defended by the Wu general Zhu Ran and some 5,000 soldiers. The Wei forces managed to defeat Wu reinforcements led by Sun Sheng (Â≠´Áõõ), Pan Zhang and Yang Can (Ê•äÁ≤≤), who were trying to help Zhu Ran. During the siege, Cao Zhen ordered his troops to dig tunnels, pile up earth to form small mounds, and build watchtowers to rain arrows on the defenders in Jiangling. Zhu Ran and his men managed to hold their ground and even found a small opportunity to counterattack and destroy two Wei camps.

At the same time, he also ordered Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi to lead a detachment of troops to Ji Valley (ÁÆïË∞∑) and pretend to be preparing to attack Mei County (ÈÉøÁ∏£; southeast of present-day Fufeng County, Shaanxi), so as to draw the Wei forces' attention away from Mount Qi.

When the Wei imperial court received news of the invasion, Cao Rui ordered Cao Zhen to lead Wei forces to resist the invaders. At Ji Valley, Cao Zhen easily defeated Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi, who had been given command of the weaker soldiers in the Shu army.

As Cao Zhen foresaw, Zhuge Liang indeed led Shu forces to attack Chencang in the spring of 229. However, as Hao Zhao and the Wei defenders were well-prepared, they managed to hold their ground against the second Shu invasion. Zhuge Liang ordered a retreat after failing to breach Chencang's walls. As a reward for Cao Zhen's contributions, Cao Rui increased the number of taxable households in his marquisate, bringing it up to a total of 2,900.(Áúü‰ª•‰∫ÆÊá≤ÊñºÁ•ÅÂ±±ÔºåÂæåÂá∫ÂøÖÂæûÈô≥ÂÄâÔºå‰πÉ‰ΩøÂ∞áËªçÈÉùÊò≠„ÄÅÁéãÁîüÂÆàÈô≥ÂÄâÔºåÊ≤ªÂÖ∂Âüé„ÄÇÊòéÂπ¥Êò•Ôºå‰∫ÆÊûúÂúçÈô≥ÂÄâÔºåÂ∑≤ÊúâÂÇôËÄå‰∏çËÉΩÂÖã„ÄÇÂ¢ûÈÇëÔºåÂπ∂Ââç‰∫åÂçÉ‰πùÁôæÊà∂„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 9. =Aborted campaign against Shu= In 230, Cao Rui summoned Cao Zhen to the imperial capital Luoyang, where he promoted him to Grand Marshal (Â§ßÂè∏È¶¨) and awarded him the ceremonial privileges of carrying a sword and wearing shoes into the imperial court, as well as not having to walk in briskly during imperial court sessions.([Â§™Âíå]ÂõõÂπ¥ÔºåÊúùÊ¥õÈôΩÔºåÈÅ∑Â§ßÂè∏È¶¨ÔºåË≥úÂäíÂ±•‰∏äÊÆøÔºåÂÖ•Êúù‰∏çË∂®„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 9.

The rendezvous point for Cao Zhen and Sima Yi's armies was at Nanzheng County (ÂçóÈÑ≠Á∏£; in present-day Hanzhong, Shaanxi).

In his younger days, he served under his foster father Cao Cao along with Cao Zun (ÊõπÈÅµ), a distant relative of his, and Zhu Zan (Êú±ËÆö), who was from the same hometown as him. Both Cao Zun and Zhu Zan died early. Cao Zhen took pity on their families so he requested permission from Cao Rui to give away parts of his marquisate to Cao Zun and Zhu Zan's sons. Cao Rui issued an imperial decree to praise Cao Zhen for his kindness, and award secondary marquis titles to Cao Zun and Zhu Zan's sons and give them each 100 taxable households.(ÁúüÂ∞ëËàáÂÆó‰∫∫ÊõπÈÅµ„ÄÅÈÑâ‰∫∫Êú±ËÆö‰∏¶‰∫ãÂ§™Á•ñ„ÄÇÈÅµ„ÄÅËÆöÊó©‰∫°ÔºåÁúüÊÑç‰πãÔºå‰πûÂàÜÊâÄÈ£üÈÇëÂ∞ÅÈÅµ„ÄÅËÆöÂ≠ê„ÄÇË©îÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§ßÂè∏È¶¨ÊúâÂèîÂêëÊí´Â≠§‰πã‰ªÅÔºåÁØ§ÊôèÂπ≥‰πÜË¶Å‰πãÂàÜ„ÄÇÂêõÂ≠êÊàê‰∫∫‰πãÁæôÔºåËÅΩÂàÜÁúüÈÇëË≥úÈÅµ„ÄÅËÆöÂ≠êÁàµÈóúÂÖß‰æØÔºåÂêÑÁôæÊà∂„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 9.

In 239, before Cao Rui died, he appointed Cao Shuang and Sima Yi as regents for his underage adopted son, Cao Fang, who succeeded him as the third emperor of Wei. In 249, Sima Yi staged a coup d'√©tat against Cao Shuang and successfully seized power from him. After the coup d'√©tat, Cao Shuang and his brothers were convicted of treason and executed along with their entire families.Zizhi Tongjian vol. 75. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Cao Zhen appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical figures and events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He makes a late first appearance in Chapter 84 when he accompanies Cao Pi on a campaign against Eastern Wu. Cao Zhen starts to play a more important role from Chapter 91 onwards when the Shu regent Zhuge Liang launches the Northern Expeditions against Wei. His contributions in the series of battles against Shu are largely downplayed because the author, Luo Guanzhong, wanted to accentuate Sima Yi's resourcefulness and effectively portray him as Zhuge Liang's nemesis. Luo Guanzhong even attributed Cao Zhen's death to his failure to heed Sima Yi's forewarning of a Shu offensive. In Chapter 100, Sima Yi warns Cao Zhen that Shu forces will, within the next ten days, launch an attack on Mount Qi (Á•ÅÂ±±; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu), a strategic location which would allow further incursions into the Wei heartland. After Cao Zhen refuses to believe Sima Yi, the two make a bet and each of them leads half of the Wei army to guard the valleys to the east and west of Mount Qi. Cao Zhen prepares for battle halfheartedly as he thinks that he is right. Seven days later, when his scouts report that a small number of Shu soldiers are approaching the valley, Cao Zhen sends his subordinate Qin Liang (Áß¶ËâØ) to lead 5,000 men to survey the terrain. As Qin Liang and his men travel deeper into the valley, they fall into an ambush by Shu forces led by Liao Hua and Guan Xing and are completely destroyed. The Shu forces then disguise themselves by wearing the Wei soldiers' armour and uniform and infiltrate Cao Zhen's camp. In the meantime, Sima Yi encounters and defeats Shu forces led by Wei Yan. When he learns that no enemy forces have been spotted at Cao Zhen's side, he immediately leads his troops to Cao Zhen's camp. By then, the Shu infiltrators have launched a surprise attack within Cao Zhen's camp. Sima Yi shows up in time, drives back the Shu forces, and saves Cao Zhen. Cao Zhen feels so ashamed of himself that he falls sick. Zhuge Liang writes a letter to Cao Zhen to taunt and insult him. Cao Zhen becomes so angry after reading the letter that he coughs blood and dies that night in his camp. Sima Yi sends his dead body back to Luoyang, where he receives a proper burial.

In 249, he assisted his father Sima Yi in overthrowing the emperor Cao Fang's regent Cao Shuang, allowing the Sima family to become paramount authority in the state, and he inherited his father's authority after his father's death in 251. He maintained a tight grip on the political scene and, when the emperor, Cao Fang, considered action against him in 254, had him deposed and replaced with his cousin, Cao Mao. This tight grip eventually allowed him to, at the time of his death in 255 after just having quelled a rebellion, transition his power to his younger brother, Sima Zhao, whose son Sima Yan eventually usurped the throne and established the Jin dynasty. After Sima Yan became emperor, he, recognising Sima Shi's role in his own imperial status, posthumously honoured his uncle as Emperor Jing of Jin (ÊôØÂ∏ù), with the temple name Shizong (‰∏ñÂÆó). Early life Sima Shi was born in 208. He was Sima Yi's oldest son, born of Sima Yi's wife, Zhang Chunhua (ÂºµÊò•ËèØ). When he was young, he was known for the elegance in his conduct and his intelligence, earning him a reputation equal to that of Xiahou Xuan and He Yan, with He Yan having gone as far as to once state: \\"The only person who could have the great achievements under the heaven is probably Sima Ziyuan.\\" As his father was an important Wei official, Sima Shi himself climbed up the ranks of officials fairly rapidly. Between the years of 237 and 239, Sima Shi was appointed as Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary (Êï£È®éÂ∏∏‰æç), and received some promotions to the post of Military Protector of the Palace (‰∏≠Ë≠∑Ëªç). Career up to 251 =Incident at the Gaoping Tombs= When Sima Yi started planning a coup d'√©tat against Cao Shuang; according to the Jin Shu, Sima Yi confided only in Sima Shi, excluding even Shi's younger brother Sima Zhao from the discussion (although Sima Guang found this unlikely and, in his Zizhi Tongjian, opined that Sima Yi planned the coup with both Sima Shi and Sima Zhao). Sima Shi put together a group of 3,000 loyal men without knowledge by Cao Shuang or his associates, and when Sima Yi set to carry out his plans in 249, Sima Shi was able to quickly summon the men to carry out the coup. Once Sima Yi overthrew Cao Shuang and became the sole regent for the emperor, Cao Fang, he rewarded his son with the title Marquess of Changpingxiang, a large fief of 1,000 households, and shortly thereafter, the rank of General of the Guards (Ë°õÂ∞áËªç). Sima Shi became his father's assistant, although there was no particular record of his accomplishments during these years. After Sima Yi died in 251, he took over his father's positions without significant opposition‚Äîafter his father had, earlier that year, suppressed a failed rebellion by Wang Ling (ÁéãÊ∑©) and massacred the clans of Wang and his associates. As paramount authority =During Cao Fang's reign= Early regency Sima Shi would go on to rule the government effectively and impartially, ordering that all officials recommend talents to him, that they define the hierarchical ranks, take care of the impoverished and the orphaned, and deal with the delayed personnel affairs. Shortly after his father's death, the emperor appointed him to the position of General-in-Chief Who Pacifies the Army (Êí´ËªçÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç). In late 251, Deng Ai, the Grand Administrator of Chengyang, submitted a memorial to the court in which he stated that the Xiongnu under Liu Bao were growing too powerful, and therefore proposed a method of giving the Xiongnu under Liu Bao titles and awards, so as to divide and weaken them, and to further settle them somewhere further away from the Chinese citizens and to reeducate them on Chinese cultural traditions, a proposal to which Sima Shi agreed to. At around the start of 252, Sima Shi was further promoted to the position of General-in-Chief (Â§ßÂ∞áËªç), while also being bestowed upon a post as Palace Attendant (‰æç‰∏≠), effectively giving him all control of the armies stationed both in and outside the palace. He was also given authority over the Imperial Secretariat (ÈåÑÂ∞öÊõ∏‰∫ã). It was once proposed to him to alter the existing constitutions, to which he responded: \\"A poet used to praise those who ‚Äòabide by the principles of the Heavenly Lord and appear as if they know nothing themselves‚Äô. The institutions and rules devised by ancestors of the Three Dynasties should be complied with. If there is no war, there should be no reforms in haste.\\" Battle of Hefei Sima Shi was a capable politician and administrator, but he also quickly wanted to prove his military reputation. Towards the end of 252, he launched a major attack against Eastern Wu, whose founding emperor, Sun Quan, had recently died and whose current emperor, Sun Liang, was under the regency of Zhuge Ke. Zhuge Ke was able to deal Sima Shi's forces, headed by Sima Zhao, a major blow at the Battle of Dongxing, but Sima Shi maintained himself well by making humble admissions of faults to the public and promoting the generals who tried to stop his campaign. In 253, after Sima Shi defeated Zhuge Ke in a major battle, his reputation was established, while Zhuge Ke's own was undermined (due to Zhuge Ke's failure to admit fault), and Zhuge Ke soon fell while Sima Shi's power was affirmed. Deposing Cao Fang In 254, Sima Shi made a violent move to consolidate his power, at Cao Fang's expense. Cao Fang had aligned himself with the minister Li Feng (ÊùéË±ê), and Sima Shi had growing suspicions that they were plotting against him. He summoned and interrogated Li Feng, and when Li refused to disclose his conversations with the emperor, Sima Shi beat him to death with a sword handle and then accused Li Feng and his friends Xiahou Xuan (Â§è‰æØÁéÑ) and Zhang Ji (ÂºµÁ∑ù) of treason, and had them and their families summarily executed. Cao Fang was further forced to depose his wife Empress Zhang, who was Zhang Ji's daughter. These moves further terrorised the officials into submission. Cao Fang was very angry about the deaths of Li Feng and Zhang Ji, and later in 254, his associates submitted a plan to him‚Äîthat when Sima Shi's brother Sima Zhao would arrive at the palace for an official visit before heading to his defense post at Chang'an, to kill Sima Zhao and seize his troops, and to then use those troops to attack Sima Shi. Cao Fang was apprehensive and paralysed, and did not implement the plan, but news was still leaked to Sima Shi. Sima Shi then forced Cao Fang to step down, although Sima Shi spared his life and gave him his old title of Prince of Qi. When Sima Shi notified Cao Fang's stepmother, Empress Dowager Guo, that he intended to make Cao Pi's brother Cao Ju, the Prince of Pengcheng, emperor, she managed to persuade him that such a succession would be improper‚Äîthat since Cao Ju was the uncle of her husband, Cao Rui, such a succession would leave Cao Rui effectively sonless with no heir. Sima Shi was forced to agree with her, and he made, as she suggested, Cao Mao emperor instead. Cao Mao, although 14 years old at the time, was known for his intelligence, and Empress Dowager Guo might have believed that he, alone of the princes and dukes, might have had a chance of counteracting the Simas. =During Cao Mao's reign= Second Rebellion at Shouchun and death Despite Empress Dowager Guo's intentions and Cao Mao's own intelligence, they made very little impact in trying to stem the tide of the Simas' growing power. In reaction to the removal of Cao Fang, the general Guanqiu Jian, in 255, as the commander in the important eastern city of Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; in present-day Lu'an, Anhui), along with another general Wen Qin (ÊñáÊ¨Ω), raised a rebellion against the Simas, but were quickly crushed by Sima Shi's army. Guanqiu Jian was killed, and his clan was slaughtered. Wen Qin and his sons fled to Eastern Wu. The campaign had its tolls on Sima Shi, however. He was ill with an eye disorder at the time that Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin's rebellion started, and had just had an eye surgery. He was initially therefore reluctant to lead the forces himself and wanted his uncle, Sima Fu, to lead the forces against Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin. At the urging of Wang Su, Fu Gu (ÂÇÖÂòè), and Zhong Hui, he led the troops himself, which was important in the victory against Guanqiu Jian, but during one of the raids made by Wen Qin's son Wen Yang (ÊñáÈ¥¶), Sima Shi, in his anxiety, aggravated the eye that he had just had the operation in‚Äîcausing his eye to pop out‚Äîand his conditions soon deteriorated greatly. Less than a month after he put down the rebellion, he died while at Xuchang (Ë®±Êòå; in present-day Xuchang, Henan), with his brother Sima Zhao in attendance to succeed him.

Wentworth was founded in 1904 and offers career-focused education through its 19 bachelor's degree programs as well as master's degrees. History Wentworth's quad In 1903, Boston businessman Arioch Wentworth left the bulk of his estate, estimated at $7 million, for the purpose of founding an industrial school within the city. Accordingly, a board of seven directors incorporated Wentworth Institute on April 5, 1904, as a school \\"to furnish education in the mechanical arts\\". The directors spent several years investigating the educational needs of the community, increased the endowment ($3.5 million at the time), and reached a settlement with Wentworth's daughter, who had contested his will. The campus was established in Boston's Back Bay Fens, and Arthur L. Williston was hired as the first principal of the college. On September 25, 1911, Wentworth opened its doors as a technical school to 242 students. The school quickly gained enrollment and by 1919, it had 1,800 students in day and evening programs and 45 teachers. In 1953, Wentworth named its first president, H. Russell Beatty. Wentworth became a degree-granting institution in 1957 and began awarding its first baccalaureate-level degrees in 1970. Wentworth began a transition from a commuter college to a residential college in the 1960s, with the addition of several residence halls. In 1972, the Institute admitted its first female students. By 2005, women represented 21% of the academic population. In 1975, cooperative education programs were introduced at Wentworth. In 1973, Wentworth instructors unionized to join the American Federation of Teachers and on October 28, 1977, the teachers of Wentworth went on strike.Clifford, Joseph P. A Century of Honesty, Energy, Economy, System: Wentworth Institute of Technology, 1904‚Äì2004. Boston: Wentworth Institute of Technology, 2003. Print. Until 1977, the college's lower and upper divisions operated as two separate schools, when they merged and the Wentworth Institute of Technology was created. With admissions numbers growing, Wentworth expanded by acquiring the former Ira Allen School building from the city of Boston in 1980, and the former Boston Trade High School in 1983. Major renovations to the third floor of Annex Hall were constructed in 1989 at a cost of $1 million to add architectural studios and facilities, and Wentworth gained accreditation from the National Architectural Accrediting Board in 1991. In 1993, Wentworth introduced a pair of five-year engineering programs to the curriculum: electromechanical engineering, and environmental engineering. In 2002, these programs received initial accreditation from the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). In 2001 and 2005 Wentworth opened new residence halls with 473 and 360 beds respectively, ending Wentworth's status as a majority commuter school. On June 8, 2005, Zorica Pantic was announced as Wentworth's fourth president. She assumed office on August 1, 2005, as the first female engineer to head an institute of technology. Her inaugural ceremony was held on April 5, 2006. President Pantic, announced on February 20, 2017 that she would be stepping down from the role of President on May 31, 2019. In November 2009, Wentworth became a master's degree-granting institution, with the creation and accreditation of its Master of Architecture program. Since then, several other master's programs have been added to the curriculum. Wentworth received approval for ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù status from the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education in July 2017. As required by the Code of the Massachusetts Regulations, the Institute has established graduate programs in four ‚Äúdistinct professional fields of study‚Äù and has demonstrated that it has ‚Äúfaculty, facilities, and resources necessary to support sound graduate programs.‚Äù Despite being accredited as a university, school officials announced that the school's name would remain \\"Wentworth Institute of Technology.\\" https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/07/28/wenworth-earns- university-status-will-keep-its-focus/tuik5wXOTeirioG8mor0uJ/story.html Academics Wentworth has academic departments dedicated to applied mathematics, architecture, biomedical engineering, civil engineering, computer science and computer networking, construction management, cybersecurity, electrical engineering, humanities and social sciences, industrial design, interior design, management, mechanical engineering and technology, and sciences. Wentworth offers bachelor's degrees in 18 engineering, technology, design and management majors. As a fundamental part of Wentworth education, the Institute requires students to complete two cooperative education semesters in work placements. =Accelerate= Accelerate is Wentworth's Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center. Incorporated in May 2012, Accelerate hosts a series of programs and workshops with the goal of nurturing a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students. In its first four years, more than 3,500 Wentworth students participated in Accelerate and established 650 product ideas as part of interdisciplinary teams. Students received mentoring from more than 100 alumni and professionals and 42 Accelerate teams were funded for a total of $167,000. Campus Wentworth's Douglas D. Schumann Library & Learning Commons The Wentworth campus is located in the Fenway neighborhood of Boston. It consists primarily of 15 buildings for administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, laboratories, library, and athletic facilities. Students enrolled for full-time study may live in one of nine residence halls near the main campus buildings. The main buildings are on Huntington Avenue, and are served by two stations of the MBTA Green Line E branch. In the Fall of 2016, the newly renovated Douglas D. Schumann Library & Learning Commons opened, a modern learning space which aims to forward student collaboration. The library is named for Wentworth alum Douglass Schumann, whose $5 million gift kick-started the renovation. The facility includes a number of private rooms that can be booked by students or faculty for meetings, project collaboration or study. The Institute's collaborating neighbors include the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, Northeastern University, the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, and the Museum of Fine Arts. Wentworth is a member of the Colleges of the Fenway consortium, and shares many facilities and activities with nearby institutions. The campus is adjacent to the Mission Hill section of Boston's Roxbury neighborhood, which is popular for off-campus housing, for dining out, and for community service volunteering. =Center for Community and Learning Partnerships= The Center for Community and Learning Partnerships supports neighborhood concerns while enhancing the educational and professional environment at Wentworth. It is the hub for community service, service learning, and college access and success initiatives at the Institute. Projects and programs facilitated through the Center during the 2007‚Äì08 academic year engaged more than 1,800 students who contributed 116,000 hours to community-based work and service. According to the Independent Sector and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a volunteer hour in Massachusetts was valued at $25.47 in 2007. Based on this figure, Wentworth's service efforts had an estimated economic impact of approximately $3 million for the 2007‚Äì08 academic year. Wentworth's civic engagement work garnered national recognition in 2008, earning the Elective Classification for Campus and Community Engagement from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Student life The interior of a Wentworth apartment at 525 Huntington Avenue Students studying inside the Ira Allen building on campus =Enrollment= The majority of Wentworth students are US citizens or permanent residents with a smaller population of international students. Most students choose on-campus housing, which creates a large, diverse residential community. A larger portion of the student body has historically been composed of male students. To balance this, the Institute has placed an emphasis on female applicants and has a number of programs and areas dedicated to women. Resources for women include the Women's Center (a designated female lounge), the Woman to Woman Program, and the establishment of the Society of Women Engineers on campus. More women entering fields such as architecture and engineering has led to more female applicants and female enrollment has recently increased. Total enrollment (2018): 4,516 total (4,341 undergraduate and 175 graduate students) *Men: 79% *Women: 21%  Athletics  Students workout in the Schumann Fitness Center Wentworth's athletics programs include 17 varsity, two club, and six intramural sports, emphasizing both men's and women's sports. The athletic program competes as a Division III member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and holds memberships in the Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC), the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC), and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Since 1989, the Leopards have captured 24 conference championships in Men's Volleyball, Baseball, Men's Basketball, Hockey, Golf, Men's Soccer, Men's Tennis, Men's Cross Country, and Women's Soccer. Wentworth has earned an invitation to the NCAA Division III Tournament 9 times (Men's Basketball: 1997 and 2007; Hockey: 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004; Men's Volleyball: 2016, 2017; Women's Soccer 2016) in the last 20 years. Wentworth received ECAC Tournament bids in baseball, men's basketball, hockey, lacrosse, men's soccer and women's soccer within the last 12 years. A multi-purpose athletic field, a gift from Myles Sweeney '28 and his wife, Eugenia, opened in 1996. Sweeney Field is in front of the main building of the Institute - Wentworth Hall. Since 1996, the men's and women's soccer teams have enjoyed a combined home record of 81-27-2 (75% won). Individual student-athletes have garnered numerous all-league, rookie of the year, and player of the year honors throughout Wentworth's history, with 11 Academic All-America honorees including the Division III softball Academic All-America in 2015.

History After Acorn withdrew from the desktop computer industry in 1998, Castle Technology acquired the rights to produce the A7000, A7000+ and RISC PC using the Acorn brand. In 2001, development started on the Iyonix PC (codenamed Tungsten) as a set-top unit (STU) in secret by engineers at Pace's Shipley campus along with a 32-bit version of RISC OS 4 (known as RISC OS 5). When management discovered the project the campus was closed. Castle Technology acquired the proposed designs and the original engineers from Pace to further develop the Tungsten into a desktop computer. Robert Sprowson, the original hardware designer, declined to join Castle Technology and so Peter Wild was recruited. The Iyonix PC was released six months later. Although it was well received, it was not designed for long-term production and therefore used some components that were near obsolete when it was released. A problem for the Iyonix PC was that it used leaded components which were outlawed with the adoption of Directive 2002/95/EC in February 2003 by the European Union. However, by this time Castle Technology was financially troubled and could not afforded to re- engineer the Iyonix PC without the leaded components. The remaining Iyonix stock were passed to Iyonix Limited which stopped distribution on 30 September 2008. In 2004, Castle Technology acquired Tematic to further development of RISC OS in embedded systems. In December 2005, Castle Technology moved its main office to the former premises of its software development division, following the migration of Tematic to a neighbouring premises in Signet Court, Cambridge.

Media activism additionally educates the audience to be producers of their own media. Media activism to be expanded to facilitate action through media production and involvement. Case studies Social Media has become a primary organizing tool for political and social movements globally. They serve to strengthen already existing networks of political and social relationships among activists offline. Media activism among youth can be linked to the way youth protest and create communities online over specific issues and social connections.Wolf, Linda (2001). Global Uprising: Confronting the Tyrannies of the 21st Century : Stories from a New Generation of Activists. New Society Publ. =China= China has strong censorship laws in place, where the press freedoms are not considered free, rather oppressive. Youth in China have worked towards stronger press freedoms online and a dedication to utilizing the principles of media activism. Intensive civic conversation occurs online in China. Youth satirized the government through what came to be known as \\"the River Crab critique,\\" in turn spurring civic conversation on the internet. Media Activists in China used their online presence and freedom to alter images, such as Marilyn Monroe, to have the face of Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong. This image was coined as Maorilyn Maoroe, which in the image is juxtaposed next to a homophone for profanity. \\"Maorilyn Maoroe\\" was an opponent to the societal River Crab, which is a pun on \\"harmonious,\\" a principle that Chinese censorship was created to promote, but has failed to do so.R.L.G.. \\"Chinese censorship: F«é K√® Y√≥u, River Crab.\\" The Economist, 7 June 2011. Web. 14 May 2013. In China, youth and other media activists have discovered and utilized new methods to indirectly criticize the political and societal environments, going around the government censorship. Social media is among the newest method of critique. Activists use \\"microblogs\\" to critique the government.Mead, Walter. \\"Social Media Endangers and Empowers China‚Äôs Activists.\\" The American Interest, 5 Mar. 2013. Web. 3 May 2013. Blogging can therefore be seen as a media activist approach to civic participation within the bounds of government censorship. = North Africa & The Middle East = Arab Spring Protesters in Egypt celebrate in Tahrir Square after President Mubarak announced his resignation. The 2011 Arab Spring uprisings made extensive use of social media activism within the countries of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. These nations concentrated on the ability of the society to operate social media and begin organizing a grassroots initiative for a globalized form of democracy. Arab youth population are described as \\"opening\\" societies through social media in places where governments are otherwise repressive. Egyptian protesters utilized social media to reduce the difficulties and cost associated with organizing rallies and a readily-mobilized political force. This facilitation of assembly through social media allowed the creation of new gateways for civic engagement where Egypt had suppressed such opportunities under emergency power for the last 30 years. This facilitation of assembly through social media allowed the creation of new gateways for civic engagement where Egypt had suppressed such opportunities under emergency power for the last 30 years. This uprising led to violent conflict within each of the nations, and can thus media and media activism can be viewed as a fundamental contributor to the nation's new national identity under a new rule. = Philippines = The Philippines was once said to have the freest press in Southeast Asia, after the ousting of Ferdinand Marcos, due to the subsequent rapid expansion of newspapers, radio stations, and programming throughout the country. This has changed over the years, especially after events such as the Maguindanao massacre, where 34 journalists were killed in a single event. Competing interests within traditional media also complicate the landscape of journalistic transparency‚Äîa number of the country's largest newspapers are owned by a few select families who compete in both business and politics. In response, local organizations have turned to alternative forms of information dissemination. For example, indigenous groups in the Philippines have developed their online media presence in order to build international awareness of local issues‚Äîsuch as land grabbing‚Äîsince local corporations and political powers and influence over the mainstream media.  Mary Jane Veloso  In 2010, Mary Jane Veloso, an overseas Filipino domestic worker, was arrested and convicted in Indonesia for attempting to smuggle 5.7lb of heroin. She was placed on death row and was initially set to be executed. Human rights organizations claimed that Veloso was used by her recruiters as a drug mule and should be given the opportunity to defend herself in court. Through a joint effort of legal advocacy and online media activism, Veloso's execution was delayed. The petition on Change.org to support her was one of the fastest-growing and most signed online petitions from the region. = United States = Media activism has a long history in the United States including the revolutionary pamphleteers of the Revolutionary War, the abolitionist press in the decades leading up to the Civil War and the socialist press during the years of the labor movement such as The Appeal to Reason which supported the presidential candidate Eugene Debs. Occupy Wall Street Protestors as a part of the occupy wall street movement The Occupy Wall Street movement, which began during the fall of 2011, is another instance were social media largely contributed to the efforts of the initiative. It was a people powered movement beginning September 17, 2011 in Liberty Square in Manhattans financial district. As Occupy Wall Street sprang up in parks and under tents, one of the main issues the protesters pushed was economic inequality. Then with the winter pressing forward the police swept the protesters away. All across the country the crowds began to thin and enthusiasm diminished, and eventually the movement all but dissolved. The catch phrase that became well known by the occupants was \\"We are the 99 percent.‚Äù The 99 percent were referred to as the lower- income people that are struggling to make a change. This was in contrast to the 1% who were well off financially and were in control of social, political and economic levers of powers. From here it spread to cities all over the United State, and globally. The movement came about because of the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Its main goal was to fight against the unequal income gap and the corrupting influence of money. Although many people believed that the movement disappeared, it has instead evolved into a variety of different causes. One of Occupies largest unrecognized victories is the drive for a higher minimum wage. The occupy protests helped to motivate workers in the fast food industry in New York City to walk off their jobs in November, 2012, triggering national movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This march in New York helped lead the way for tens of thousands of workers who marched in hundreds of cities asking for better paying conditions. Occupy Wall Street protesters capitalized on the tools of social media to spread awareness about the movement, to inform participants about organized meetings, rallies, and events, and to ultimately generate national news and mainstream media attention. Social media handles like Facebook and Twitter were used to bring people from all over to one place for an agreed upon cause. It started off with the small number of people who had the idea. Once the events, rallies and protests began, it gained the attention from mass media. This ultimately created a huge platform for the change these participants yearned for.  Black Lives Matter  Black Lives Matter, a campaign against violence and systemic racism towards African Americans, has been influenced strongly by Social Media Activism with leaders, hashtags, and policy proposals brought forward because of Social Media. The hashtag #blacklivesmatter was created in 2013 by Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi after the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the murder in Florida of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin. Garza wrote a Facebook post titled \\"A Love Note to Black People\\" in which she said: \\"Our Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.‚Äù Once the hashtag was formed, it has been a rallying cry for various organizing efforts across the country centered on Black lives. It is a movement that brings the African American community together. It is a campaign that does not promote violence but instead unity. There can be both negative or positive views on the movement due to the way the media affects people. This movement began in 2013 when people started hash tagging #BLM, #BlackLivesMatter, and #equality on Twitter, Facebook, and many social media platforms. In response to the visible violent acts against Black communities more than 50 organizations from across the country have come together to fight this unfairness based on color. Today this is still an issue, and in some peoples' opinion media does not have a positive effect on BLM. It causes people to riot and build more hatred for each other instead of the whole concept of unity. Sometimes the media, which has fake news can take things out of context, in result people will have an upsetting reaction. African Americans use Twitter at a higher rate than their white counterparts with 22 percent of online blacks using the service in 2014 compared to 16 percent of online whites. Hashtags such as #OscarsSoWhite, #handsupdontshoot, and #icantbreathe have sprung up as offshoots in the social movement and have helped create a subculture on the website that some have called ‚ÄúBlack Twitter‚Äù. Jelani Cobb, professor of Journalism at Columbia University, has argued that that ‚ÄúBlack Twitter‚Äù has been as vital to Black Lives Matter as television was for the Civil Rights Movement. Citizen reporting on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook help drive the coverage of traditional media on stories of violence, discrimination, and harassment. ALS Ice Bucket Challenge The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge was a form of media activism that swept through online communities to bring awareness to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, a fatal disease which causes damage to a person's motor functions through the break down of nerve cells. The challenge involves pouring a bucket of cold water over a person's head, and donating to the ALS Association. It began in July 2014, when Chris Kennedy first challenged his sister, Jeanette Senerchia, to participate in the challenge. Senerchia was inspired to partake in order to support her husband who had previously been diagnosed with the disease. Soon the challenge became widespread across mainstream media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The challenge picked up a mass following due to the amount of lives touched by the disease and the desire to see progress in the fight against ALS. The accumulation of donations made by supporters of the cause resulted in as much as $115 million being donated to the ALS Association in an effort to find a cure and bring awareness to the cause. Kony 2012 Joseph Kony was the leader of Uganda's Lords Resistance Army (LRA) in 2012. He was accused of abducting over 60,000 Ugandan children, turning the boys into brainwashed killing machines and the young girls into sex slaves. He killed anyone who stood in his way. In 2012, an American charity named \\"Invisible Children\\" took Kony's actions and turned them into a short film, posting it on YouTube. It was the fastest growing viral video of all time, receiving over 100 million views in the span of 6 days. Kony had been wanted by the International Criminal Court since 2005 for crimes against humanity. After gaining so much attention from social media sites like YouTube and Twitter, the U.S. finally declares the LRA a terrorist group in 2008. They even sent 100 of their own troops to support Uganda in tracking Kony and taking him down. Hundreds of thousands of people tweeted with the hashtag \\"#stopkony\\". The Kony video resulted in never before seen international efforts to end Africa's longest lasting issue. The video incorporated people form all over the world who probably had no idea this problem was occurring otherwise. It proved that if people knew about an issue and were given the opportunity to help, they in fact would. Social justice campaigns have been using new media strategies to communicate to the public. Things like online distribution, podcasts and the new cultural norm of social media have been fused with the traditional rallies, protests and lobbying efforts and have created a new type of change that is somewhat convenient for its followers. These new social platforms have made it possible for the public to be both the consumer and producer of media, making their efforts for change reach numbers of people at never before seen speed, like the Kony video. =Venezuela= Today nearly 32 percent of Venezuelan internet-users utilize social media on regular basis.Golinger, Eva. \\"Internet Revolution in Venezuela  venezuelanalysis.com\\". venezuelanalysis.com  Venezuela News, Views, and Analysis. Retrieved 26 Mar. 2013 Most recently, social media has been used politically to achieve success during elections, including the 2012 re-election campaign of President Hugo Ch√°vez and the 2013 presidential campaign between Nicol√°s Maduro and Henrique Capriles Radonski.

Digital communication is relied on heavily to conserve the Rotuman culture. The communication aspects of digital media are of great benefit. The use of digital media allows the Rotuman people to remain in touch and conserve their culture.  Frameworks for the use of media in political movements  Scholars have attempted to create theoretical frameworks to illustrate the use of media within social movements and activism. One example is the four-stage model for political movements using social media created by Rodrigo Sandoval-Almazan and J. Roman Gil-Garcia. 1. Triggering event 2. Media response 3. Viral organization 4. Physical response Limitations of social media activism have also been pointed out by scholars. Some critics argue that media activism and internet activism still require the coverage of traditional mass media outlets in order to gain significant traction. Social movements, especially ones rooted in online social media, also require a critical mass of participants in order to sustain the presence on social media platforms. A study of the protests and media activism sparked by the 2009 Iranian presidential election also suggests that digital creations and media have to be emotionally moving in order to in order to spur civic engagement and mobilization of citizens.  Representation of Indigenous groups  Media activism has also provided an opportunity for Indigenous peoples to address issues of local government inadequacy. Through the usage of media technology and online communication, Indigenous groups are able to reach out further than their specific localities and build solidarity with other national minorities who face similar issues. Indigenous groups in the Philippines have been able to use online media to debunk stereotypes propagated in national media and to communicate their causes and claims with an international audience. Media activism also allows indigenous groups to mobilize external support from international allies, especially when local conditions become too dangerous to mobilize locally, due cases of political harassment or extrajudicial killings. Agents of media in terms of activism, are a doubled edged sword which indicate the historic importance, while also laying stepping stones for its significance in the future. Similarly, indigenous life writing is a phenomenon which not only signifies its historic importance but also lays the foundation for the future white settler conception of colonialism and a medium to secure land rights for the indigenous. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people use social media at higher rates than non-Indigenous Australians. As a form of activism, they use social media and especially memes, to challenge dominant views of Australian history. In a comprehensive study of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social media use, Bronwyn Carlson and Ryan Frazer found that many people experience unpleasant interactions like trolling and racism, but still value social media: ‚ÄúFor many, it had become an invaluable tool in the realisation of their hopes and dreams; it helped them ‚Äòfind‚Äô and share their identities and produce intimate communities of mutual trust, respect, care and kindness.‚Äù Social media is an important tool for developing activists‚Äô collective identities. Suppression In light of the benefits of media activism, there are those who oppose the usage of it as an organizing tool. One caveat of technology is that those in power can use the internet to track down and target activists. Dominant elites, or those challenged by media activism, have tried to push back by filtering the internet, blocking specific websites, decreasing the connection speeds, and tracking users who view political information. States such as North Korea, Venezuela, and China have attempted to curtail media activism through a variety of tactics. The Chinese state engages in media censorship in the name of national harmony, although the Council on Foreign Relations argues that suppression of online activism is to protect authorities' political or economic interests. In North Korea, the state curtails virtually all forms of digital communication, but a few transnational citizen-journalists have used technology like cell phones and thumb drives to communicate accurate news to citizens and abroad.  Criticisms of Media Activism  Although media activism is a form of activism it is not a form of high risk activism, more a form of organization through communication. Slacktivism is a term coined to emphasize on the lack of action media activism enrolls, through engaging in the talk of social issues but not reacting. Critics argue that media activism does not seem to be the most efficient engine in taking action towards social regimes, however many recognize it as a powerful tool of communication to connect like minded populations.

The term was coined by W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley in 1949 as a principle of New Criticism which is often paired with their study of The Intentional Fallacy. Concept The concept of affective fallacy is an answer to the idea of impressionistic criticism, which argues that the reader's response to a poem is the ultimate indication of its value. It is the antithesis of affective criticism, which is the practice of evaluating the effect that a literary work has on its reader or audience. The concept was presented after the authors had presented their paper on The Intentional Fallacy. First defined in an article published in The Sewanee Review in 1946,https://www.jstor.org/stable/27537676?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents the concept of an affective fallacy was most clearly articulated in The Verbal Icon, Wimsatt's collection of essays published in 1954. Wimsatt used the term to refer to all forms of criticism that understood a text's effect upon the reader to be the primary route to analyzing the importance and success of that text. This definition of the fallacy, if strictly followed, touches on or wholly includes nearly all of the major modes of literary criticism, from Ovid's docere delictendo (to teach by delighting), Aristotle's catharsis, and Longinus's concept of \\"transport\\" to late-nineteenth century belles-lettres and the contemporary Chicago Critics. For Wimsatt, the fallacy led to a number of potential errors, most of them related to emotional relativism. A view of literature based on its putative emotional effects will always be vulnerable to mystification and subjectivity; Wimsatt singles out the belletristic tradition exemplified by critics such as Arthur Quiller-Couch and George Saintsbury as an instance of a type of criticism that relies on subjective impressions and is thus unrepeatable and unreliable. For Wimsatt, as for all the New Critics, such impressionistic approaches pose both practical and theoretical problems. In practical terms, it makes reliable comparisons of different critics difficult, if not irrelevant. In this light, the affective fallacy ran afoul of the New Critics' desire to place literary criticism on a more objective and principled basis. On the theoretical plane, the critical approach denoted as affective fallacy was fundamentally unsound because it denied the iconicity of the literary text. New Critical theorists stressed the unique nature of poetic language, and they asserted that‚Äîin view of this uniqueness‚Äîthe role of the critic is to study and elucidate the thematic and stylistic \\"language\\" of each text on its own terms, without primary reference to an outside context, whether of history, biography, or reader-response. In practice, Wimsatt and the other New Critics were less stringent in their application of the theory than in their theoretical pronouncements. Wimsatt admitted the appropriateness of commenting on emotional effects as an entry into a text, as long as those effects were not made the focus of analysis. Reception As with many concepts of New Criticism, the concept of the affective fallacy was both controversial and, though widely influential, never accepted wholly by any great number of critics. The first critiques of the concept came, naturally enough, from those academic schools against whom the New Critics were ranged in the 1940s and 1950s, principally the historical scholars and the remaining belletristic critics. Early commentary deplored the use of the word \\"fallacy\\" itself, which seemed to many critics unduly combative. More sympathetic critics, while still objecting to Wimsatt's tone, accepted as valuable and necessary his attempt to place criticism on a more objective basis. However, the extremism of Wimsatt's approach was ultimately judged untenable by a number of critics. Just as New Historicism repudiated the New Critics' rejection of historical context, so reader-response criticism arose partly from dissatisfaction with the concept of the text as icon. Reader-response critics denied that a text could have a quantifiable significance outside its being read and experienced by particular readers at particular moments. These critics rejected the idea of text as icon, focusing instead on the ramifications of the interaction between text and reader. While the term remains current as a warning against unsophisticated use of emotional response in analyzing texts, the theory underlying the term has been thoroughly eclipsed by more recent developments in criticism. Wimsatt and Beardsley \\"The Affective Fallacy is a confusion between the poem and its results (what it is and what it does), a special case of epistemological skepticism [ ... which ...] begins by trying to derive the standard of criticism from the psychological effects of the poem and ends in impressionism and relativism [with the result that] the poem itself, as an object of specifically critical judgment, tends to disappear.\\" \\"The report of some readers ... that a poem or story induces in them vivid images, intense feelings, or heightened consciousness, is neither anything which can be refuted nor anything which it is possible for the objective critic to take into account.\\" Wimsatt and Beardsley on an ideal, objective criticism: \\"It will not talk of tears, prickles or other physiological symptoms, of feeling angry, joyful, hot, cold, or intense, or of vaguer states of emotional disturbance, but of shades of distinction and relation between objects of emotion.\\" \\"The critic is not a contributor to statistical countable reports about the poem, but a teacher or explicator of meanings. His readers, if they are alert, will not be content to take what he says as testimony, but will scrutinize it as teaching.\\" References Sources *Barry, Peter (2009).

The island has many summer cottages, mainly owned by inhabitants from Oslo (Norway's capital). This is due to the close proximity to the capital. The island is connected to the mainland, at a beautiful place called Vikene, by a ferry, going to and fro as the need arises. There is a hotel on the island with a spa (after recent refurbishment), which is heavily dependent on corporate customers. Climate In the summer the temperature is usually in the mid 20s (Celsius), and the water temperature can exceed 20 degrees Celsius in July/ August. The winters can be harsh, especially for the deer living on the island year round. Geography The island stretches north to south for about 6 km.

The bodies of seven missing young people aged 19 to 22 were discovered partially buried in the Belanglo State Forest, south-west of the New South Wales town of Berrima. Five of the victims were foreign backpackers (three German, two British) and two were Australian travellers from Melbourne. Milat was convicted of the murders on 27 July 1996 and was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences, as well as 18 years without parole. He died in prison on 27 October 2019, having never confessed to the murders for which he was convicted. Murders = Background = Up until the mid-1990s, hitchhiking in Australia was viewed as an adventurous and inexpensive, if not completely safe, means of travel. Encouraged in the 1980s by successful tourism campaigns such as Shrimp on the barbie and articles in travel publications such as Lonely Planet, backpackers on limited budgets sought ways to travel cheaply, such as purchasing used cars or using buses. However, unsolved Australian missing-person cases such as that of Trudie Adams (1978), Tony Jones (1982), Naoko Onda (1987) and Anna Rosa Liva (1991) led to those who still hitchhiked to begin to travel in pairs for safety. By the time of the first Belanglo State Forest discoveries, several other backpackers had also disappeared. One case involved a young Victorian couple from Frankston, Deborah Everist (19) and James Gibson (19), who had been missing since leaving Sydney for ConFest, near Albury, on 30 December 1989. Another related to Simone Schmidl (21), from Germany, who had been missing since leaving Sydney for Melbourne on 20 January 1991. Similarly, a German couple, Gabor Neugebauer (21) and Anja Habschied (20), had disappeared after leaving a Kings Cross hostel for Mildura on 26 December 1991. Another involved missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke (21) and Joanne Walters (22), who were last seen in Kings Cross on 18 April 1992. =First and second victims= A sign at the entrance to the Belanglo State Forest On 19 September 1992, two runners discovered a concealed corpse while orienteering in Belanglo. The following morning, police discovered a second body from the first. Police quickly confirmed, via dental records, that the bodies were those of Clarke and Walters. Walters had been stabbed 14 times; four times in the chest, once in the neck, and nine times in the back which would have paralysed her. Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head at the burial site, and police believe she had been used as target practice. After a thorough search of the forest, investigators ruled out the possibility of further discoveries within Belanglo State Forest. =Third and fourth victims= In October 1993, a local man searching for firewood discovered bones in a particularly remote section of the forest. He returned with police to the scene where two bodies were quickly discovered and later identified as Gibson and Everist. Gibson's skeleton, found in a foetal position, showed eight stab wounds. A large knife had cut through his upper spine causing paralysis, and stab wounds to his back and chest would have punctured his heart and lungs. Everist had been savagely beaten; her skull was fractured in two places, her jaw was broken and there were knife marks on her forehead. She had been stabbed once in the back. The presence of Gibson's body in Belanglo puzzled investigators as his camera had previously been discovered on 31 December 1989, and his backpack later on 13 March 1990, by the side of the road at Galston Gorge, in the northern Sydney suburbs, over to the north. =Fifth, sixth and seventh victims= On 1 November 1993, a skeleton was found in a clearing along a fire trail in the forest during a police sweep. It was later identified as that of Schmidl, and bore at least eight stab wounds: two had severed her spine and others would have punctured her heart and lungs. Clothing found at the scene was not Schmidl's, but matched that of another missing backpacker, Habschied. The bodies of Habschied and Neugebauer were then found on a nearby fire trail, on 4 November 1993, in shallow graves apart. Habschied had been decapitated, and despite an extensive search, her skull was never found. Neugebauer had been shot in the head six times. There was evidence that some of the victims did not die instantly from their injuries. =Search for the serial killer= In response to the finds, on 14 October 1993, Task Force Air, containing more than 20 detectives and analysts, was set up by the NSW Police. On 5 November 1993, the NSW government increased the reward in relation to the Belanglo serial killings to $500,000. Public warnings were also given, particularly aimed at international backpackers, to avoid hitchhiking along the Hume Highway. After developing their profile of the killer, the police faced an enormous volume of data from numerous sources. Investigators applied link analysis technology to Roads and Traffic Authority vehicle records, gym memberships, gun licensing, and internal police records. As a result, the list of suspects was progressively narrowed to a short list of 230, then to an even shorter list of 32. There were similar aspects to all the murders.. Each of the bodies had been dumped in remote bush-land and covered by a pyramid of sticks and ferns. Forensic study determined that each had suffered multiple stab wounds to the torso, and many showed signs of sexual assault. The killer, probably a local with a 4WD, had evidently restrained and spent considerable time with the victims both during and after the murders, as campsites were discovered close to the location of each body. Matching .22 bullets, shell casings, and cartridge boxes from two weapons also linked the crime scenes. Speculation arose that the crimes were the work of several killers, given that most of the victims had been attacked while as pairs, had been killed in different ways, and buried separately. On 13 November 1993, police received a call from Paul Onions (24) in the U.K. On 25 January 1990, Onions had been backpacking in Australia and, while hitchhiking from Liverpool station towards Mildura, had accepted a ride south out of Casula from a man known only as \\"Bill\\". South of the town of Mittagong, and less than 1 km from Belanglo State Forest, Bill stopped and pulled out a revolver and some ropes stating it was a robbery, at which point Onions managed to flee while Bill pursued and shot at him. Onions flagged down Joanne Berry, a passing motorist, and together they sped off and described the assailant and his vehicle to the Bowral police. On 13 April 1994, detectives re-found the note regarding Onions' call and sought the original report from Bowral police, but it was missing. Fortunately, a constable had recorded details in her notebook. Onions' statement was corroborated by Berry, who had also contacted the investigation team, along with the girlfriend of a man who worked with Ivan Milat, who thought he should be questioned over the case.  Arrest and trial  On 26 February 1994, police surveillance of the Milat house at Cinnabar Street, Eagle Vale commenced. Police learnt that Milat had recently sold his silver Nissan Patrol four-wheel drive shortly after the discovery of the bodies of Clarke and Walters. Police also confirmed that Milat had not been working on any of the days of the attacks and acquaintances also told police about Milat's obsession with weapons. Milat's brother, Bill, who often had his identity used by his brother for work or vehicle registrations, was questioned by investigators. When the connection between the Belanglo murders and Onions' experience was made, Onions flew to Australia to help with the investigation. On 5 May 1994, Onions positively identified Milat as the man who had picked him up and attempted to assault him. Milat was arrested at his home on 22 May 1994 on robbery and weapon charges related to the Onions attack after 50 police officers surrounded the premises, including heavily armed officers from the Tactical Operations Unit. The search of Milat's home revealed various weapons, including a .22-calibre Ansch√ºtz Model 1441/42 rifle and parts of a .22 calibre Ruger 10/22 rifle that matched the type used in the murders, a Browning pistol, and a Bowie knife. Also uncovered was foreign currency, clothing, a tent, sleeping bags, camping equipment and cameras belonging to several of his victims. Homes belonging to his mother and five of his brothers were also searched at the same time by over 300 police, uncovering a total of 24 weapons, 250 kg of ammunition, and several more items belonging to the victims. Milat appeared in court on 23 May, but he did not enter a plea. On 31 May, Milat was also charged with the seven backpacker murders. On 28 June, Milat sacked his defence lawyer, Marsden, and sought legal aid to pay for his defence. Meanwhile, brothers Richard and Walter were tried in relation to weapons, drugs and stolen items found on their properties. A committal hearing for Milat regarding the murders began on 24 October and lasted until 12 December, during which over 200 witnesses appeared. Based on the evidence, at the beginning of February 1995, Milat was remanded in custody until June that same year. On 26 March 1996, the trial opened at the NSW Supreme Court and was prosecuted by Mark Tedeschi. His defence argued that, in spite of the evidence, there was no non-circumstantial proof Milat was guilty and attempted to shift the blame to other members of his family, particularly Richard. 145 witnesses took the stand, including members of the Milat family who endeavoured to provide alibis, and, on 18 June, Milat himself. On 27 July 1996, after 18 weeks of testimony, a jury found Milat guilty of the murders. He was given a life sentence on each count without the possibility of parole. He was also convicted of the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Onions, for which he received six years' jail each. Other developments Police maintain that Milat could have been involved in more attacks or murders than the seven for which he was convicted. Based on MO similarities, examples include Keren Rowland (20, disappeared 26 February 1971, found in the Fairbairn Pine Plantation in May 1971), Peter Letcher (18, missing November 1987, found in the Jenolan State Forest in 1988), and Dianne Pennacchio (29, disappeared 6 September 1991, found in the Tallaganda State Forest in November 1991). Further, given the possibility of an accomplice, the murder cases were kept open. On 18 July 2005, Milat's former lawyer, Marsden, made a deathbed statement in which he claimed that Milat had been assisted by his sister, Shirley Soire (1946‚Äì2003), in the killings of the two British backpackers. In 2001, Milat was ordered to give evidence at an inquest into the disappearances in the Newcastle area of three other female backpackers (Leanne Goodall, 20, disappeared 30 December 1978; Robyn Hickie, 18, disappeared 7 April 1979; Amanda Robinson, 14, disappeared 21 April 1979). A related cold case is that of Gordana Kotevski (16) who disappeared in 1994. Although Milat was working in the area at the time of the crimes, no case has been brought against him due to a lack of evidence. Similar inquiries were launched in 2003, in relation to the disappearance of two nurses and again in 2005, relating to the disappearance of hitchhiker Annette Briffa, but no charges were laid. In 2010, in a media interview, Onions described how he accepted, but did not use, a $200,000 reward granted for his part in the conviction of Milat.  In popular culture  On 8 November 2004, Milat gave a televised interview on Australian Story, in which he denied that any of his family had been implicated in the seven murders. The 2005 Australian film Wolf Creek is based on the backpacker murders of two British females. A sequel, Wolf Creek 2, based on backpacker murders of two Germans, was released in 2013. In March 2017, the case was covered by Felon True Crime, and in March 2019, Casefile True Crime Podcast began airing a five-part series on the Belanglo crimes.

She is a member of the International Psychoanalytical Association, and often speaks at its congresses. She began as a professor at Wellesley College in 1973, a year later she began at the University of California, Santa Cruz until 1986. She then went on to spend many years as a professor in the departments of sociology and clinical psychology at the University of California, Berkeley until her retirement in 2005. Later, she began her career teaching psychiatry at Harvard Medical School/Cambridge Health Alliance. Chodorow is often described as a leader in feminist thought, especially in the realms of psychoanalysis and psychology. Chodorow has written a number of influential books in contemporary feminist writing, including The Reproduction of Mothering: Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Gender (1978);\\"Nancy (Julia) Chodorow.\\" Contemporary Authors Online.

Biography  = Personal life = Born on January 20, 1944, in New York, New York to a Jewish family. Her parents were Marvin Chodorow and Leah (Turitz) Chodorow. Her father was a professor of applied physics.Unger, Rhoda K. (March 1, 2009). \\"Psychology in the United States\\". Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia.

In 1977, they separated. = Education = Chodorow graduated from Radcliffe College in 1966. There she studied under Beatrice and W.M. Whiting. Chodorow's work focused on personality and cultural anthropology now classified as pre-feminist work. She focused on the study of personality through a Freudian lens. In 1975, she received her Ph.D. in sociology from Brandeis University.Chodorow biography at Radcliffe College Magazine website Under the instruction of Philip Slater, Chodorow was influenced to focus her studies on the unconscious phenomena of psychoanalysis. Following her Ph.D., Chodorow received clinical training at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute from 1985 to 1993.  Influences  = Sigmund Freud = Chodorow's most profound influence stems from Freudian psychoanalysis. She incorporates Freudian analysis with a feminist perspective to understand the mother-child relationship. Chodorow uses the Freudian model of female development to reveal that a girl's gender development is related to her closeness with her mother. Therefore, the girl is pursuing a privilege that a boy has already achieved. The boy has already received this attention, because he is more valued by the mother, as an object since he is a source of her own Oedipal gratification. However, the boy has both the need and the ability to detach himself from his mother. The female solves her inner conflict by converting her envy of male privilege into heterosexual desire. Using Freudian psychoanalytic theory, Chodorow explains that the Oedipus complex symbolically separates the male child from his mother, but young girls continue to identify with their mother. Chodorow notes that Freud's theory of the Oedipal conflict and the Oedipal revolution is due to chance; the father must be in the right place at the right time. Chodorow's analysis led to the hypothesis that a female's desire for men is a direct result of her strong desire for her mother. Additionally, Chodorow uses Sigmund Freud's theory to explain that the differences between men and women are largely due to capitalism and the absent father. Chodorow acknowledges the ways in which the economy changed in 2003, and the psychological impact this had on both sexes in regards to shared parenting. The development of shared parenting has challenged the traditional mothering role, resulting in a paradigm where mother and children have insufficient time for each other. Chodorow also argues that Freudian theory suppresses women. Nonetheless, the theory provides grounds for how people become gendered, how femininity and masculinity develops, and how sexism via sexual inequality is reproduced. Furthermore, Freud explains how nature becomes culture resulting in a second nature. Chodorow argues that this explains that the formation and organization of gender occur, not only through social institutions, but also through transformations in the consciousness and the psyche. Chodorow draws on Freud's idea of intraspsychic structures to understand the developmental differences between girls and boys. Freud explains that there are three parts to an individual: the id, the ego, and the super-ego. These parts produce rigid boundaries in the internal workings of our brains and impact our interactions in society. Chodorow uses this intrapsychic structure to explain that the internal workings of males and females are structurally different. Therefore, developmental differences are not inherent, rather these differences are produced through socialization. = Karen Horney = Chodorow also draws influence from Karen Horney, a 20th-century psychoanalyst who challenged Freudian ideas, ultimately leading to the foundation of feminist psychology. Horney argued against Freud's idea that females are defective or limited, and rather argued an that women possess positive feminine qualities and self valuation. = Philip Slater = Nancy Chodorow studied under the sociologist Philip Slater while she was earning her PhD at Brandeis University in 1975. Slater encouraged her to study unconscious phenomena in order to deepen her understanding of personality. Chodorow refers to Slater's book, Glory of Hera, as one of the most influential books in regards to a man's immense fear of women and its manifestation in culture. Concepts = The Reproduction of Mothering (1978) = Chodorow views mothering as a dual structure, where motherhood is partly fixed by childhood experience and the social structure of kinship. She explains that the process of a woman becoming a mother goes beyond biology and instinct alone. Chodorow argues in her book, The Reproduction of Mothering (1978; 2nd ed., 1999), that gender differences are compromised from formations of the Oedipal complex. She begins with Freud's assertion that the individual is born bisexual and that the child's mother is its first sexual object. Chodorow, drawing on the work of Karen Horney and Melanie Klein, notes that the child forms its ego in reaction to the dominating figure of the mother. The male child forms this sense of independent agency easily, identifying with the agency and freedom of the father, and emulating his possessive interest in the mother/wife. This task is not as simple for the female child. The mother identifies with her more strongly, and the daughter attempts to make the father her new love object. The female child is then is stymied in her ego formation by the intense bond with the mother. Where male children typically experience love as a dyadic relationship, daughters are caught in a libidinal triangle where the ego is pulled between love for the father, the love of the mother, and concern and worry over the relationship of the father to the mother. The strong bond between the mother and the infant, not only shapes her identity, but allows the child to acknowledge that the father is a separate being. Except, in circumstances where the father provides a similar form of primary care as the mother. This separation of the father and child can result in the child developing an ambivalence with the father. Therefore, the child is confused by the failure to recognize the mother's separateness. Consequently, children are more obedient to their father, but not because he is considered the authority figure or because of his strictness, but rather because of the child's initial relationship to the father.  Quote  \\"The mother is the early caregiver and primary source of identification for all children... A daughter continues to identify with the mother.\\" Sociologically, Chodorow explains that the strong bond between mother and daughter inhibits the daughter from forming her own identity. The first bonding beings in infancy with the mother. This initial bond is true for both sexes, except, boys breakaway at an early age to identify with their fathers. Thus, maintaining the mother-daughter relationship and identity. = Gender Personality = For Chodorow, the contrast between the dyadic and triadic first love experiences explains the social construction of gender roles. This is through the universal degradation of women in culture, cross-cultural patterns in male behavior, and marital strain in Western society after Second Wave feminism. In marriage, the woman takes less of an interest in sex and more in the children. Her ambivalence towards sex eventually drives the male away. She devotes her energies to the children once she does reach sexual maturity. Furthermore, Chodorow examines the psychological development of adult females and males. Chodorow argues that the psyches of men and women are structured differently because of dissimilar childhood experiences. The justification for why women tend to be more empathic is because women's ego boundaries are less fixed. Chodorow hypothesizes that if women are perceived by society as primarily and exclusively as mothers, then any liberation of women will continue to be experienced as traumatic by society. Chodorow argues that masculinity learned in the absence of an ongoing personal relationship with the father and without an available masculine role model, boys are taught more consciously how to be masculine. Boys' development of masculinity is used as a tool that would be used against them by the father. Therefore, masculine identity is due to gender role development. On the other hand, femininity is less consciously instilled in girls rather it is embedded in the ongoing relationship to the mother. Thus, female identification is predominantly parental.  Quote  ‚ÄúMasculinity is defined as much negatively as positively.‚Äù Chodorow argues that the production of feminine identification is a rational process. In comparison, the production of male identification is defined by rejection rather than acceptance. = Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory (1991) = In her book, Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory, Chodorow expands on the finding that a man's suppression and denial of his need for love, often leads to an inability to tolerate others who can express their desire for love. Women, on the other hand, have not suppressed these needs, and thus may be willing to deal with their lover or husband being somewhat emotionally unresponsive, in exchange for some amount of caring and love. Since this desire for love cannot be silenced through repression, men will simultaneously protect themselves against the threat of invasion by women, while still being in a heterosexual relationship. Chodorow suggests that if the father figure could become more visible and participatory in family life, then the emotional ambiguities in both sexes would be rectified. Chodorow further synthesizes the female closeness with the mother quiets the sex drive toward men, because their inner emotional lives are far more satisfied. On the other hand, she suggests that the intense sex drive of men is a result of repression, and thus men fall in love much more romantically. She argues that this idea may be the basis for male aggression toward women. Additionally, Chodorow focuses on the ways in which society values women for \\"being,\\" but men for \\"action.\\" More specifically, women are often viewed as objects, but men are rather viewed as subjects. She suggests that this idea has deeper implications, as women tend to be very relationship-oriented. Chodorow ties this idea back to Freudian theory by arguing that men pay a price for the rushed detachment from their mother, and the resulting repression of their feminine selves.  Critical Responses  Chodorow has received some criticism by sociologists for lacking empirical evidence and for her individualistic approach to social theory. Other sociologists argue that she lacks emphasis on the impact of social reality in her theories, and does not understand the idea of social determinism. Conversely, Lacanian psychoanalytic feminists argue that she is too empirical and socially deterministic. They further argue against her view of the unconscious as a sociological phenomena rather than an indisputable level of analysis.

His early work was in botany, and he helped to introduce the work of Carolus Linnaeus into England. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1741 and vice president in 1772. He was knighted in 1786. In 1746, he showed that the capacity of the Leyden jar could be increased by coating it inside and out with lead foil. In the same, year he proposed that the two types of electricity--vitreous and resinous-- posited by DuFay were actually a surplus (a positive charge) and a deficiency (a negative charge) of a single fluid which he called electrical ether, and that the quantity of electrical charge was conserved. He acknowledged that the same theory had been independently developed at the same time by Benjamin Franklin--the two men later became allies in both scientific and political matters. On 14 August 1747 he made an experiment to conduct electricity through a 6,732 foot long wire at Shooter's Hill in London. At another experiment he made, the wire was 12,276 feet. Previous experiments in France had only tried shorter distances.The Electric Telegraph, in The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science, and Art, Volume 34 (April 1855), p. 467, originally from The North British Review.The Electric Telegraph, The North British Review, vol. 22 (Feb. 1855), p. 290.

It is the largest commune in the Allier department, although the department's pr√©fecture is located in the smaller town of Moulins. Its inhabitants are known as Montlu√ßonnais. The town is in the traditional province of Bourbonnais and was part of the mediaeval duchy of Bourbon. Geography Montlu√ßon is located in the northwest of the Allier department near the frontier of the Centre-Val de Loire and Nouvelle-Aquitaine regions. Montlu√ßon is linked with surrounding regions and towns via four main road axes, plus the highway A71 from Orl√©ans to Clermont-Ferrand; through a railway linking in the North Vierzon then Paris (3-5h). Formerly the canal de Berry linked Montlu√ßon towards the north. Montlu√ßon is south of Bourges, from Paris, from Clermont-Ferrand, (3h) from Lyon, (2h) from Limoges and from the Atlantic coast. Montlu√ßon is close to the M√©ridienne verte (an architectural project marking the Paris meridian) and to the Greenwich meridian. Montlu√ßon is also close to the geographic centre of Metropolitan France. History =Early history= Montlu√ßon was built in the Middle Ages. The first mention of a place called Monte Lucii (Mont de Lucius) dates from the eleventh century. Guillaume, son of Archambaud IV of Bourbon, built the castle in a defensible position on a small rocky hill on a bend in the Cher River. The town, which formed part of the duchy of Bourbon, was taken by the English in 1171, and by Philip Augustus in 1181; the English were finally driven out in the 14th century. In the 14th century, Louis II de Bourbon re-built the castle and walls. Montlu√ßon and other Bourbon lands reverted to the French crown in 1529, and Henry IV further improved the defenses. Montlu√ßon became the administrative seat of the area in 1791, then entered the industrial era thanks to the presence of coalpits distant in Commentry, the Canal de Berry in 1830 and the railway in 1864. These transport links allowed the import of ore and export of coal, wood and manufactured goods. The population grew from 5000 inhabitants in 1830 to 50 000 in 1950. =World War II= During the Second World War, the Germans occupied the Dunlop tyre plant (even though Montlu√ßon was in the free zone) to exploit the research laboratory to synthesize rubber, since natural rubber could not be imported by the Nazis. The manufacturing of tyres for Luftwaffe aircraft was also of interest for the Nazis. For this reason, the Allies bombed the site on 12‚Äì16 September 1943, as well as part of the nearby town Saint-Victor, causing 36 deaths and injuring more than 250 civilians. A notable act of resistance occurred in the city on January 6, 1943 when a mob of citizens overran guards supervising a massive deportation of men to Germany in accordance with the Service de Travail Obligatoire (Obligatory Work Service) plan that sent able Frenchmen to fill vacancies in German factories during the war. All the men who were to be deported managed to escape into the countryside, evading the forced industrial service awaiting them in the Reich.John F. Sweets, Choices in Vichy France, (Oxford: Oxford University Press: 1994): 25. =Post-World War II= Since 1945, traditional industry (blast furnaces and glassware) has declined. Today Montlu√ßon has chemical industries, tyre manufacture (Dunlop), and electronics (Sagem), and more recently a technopole at La Loue was established for high-tech companies. New Zealand-born Australian Nancy Wake, the most decorated woman of World War II, led her small army of resistance fighters in the countryside around Montlu√ßon. On March 11, 2013 Nancy Wake's ashes were scattered in a small wood outside Montlu√ßon. The ceremony was followed by a civic reception in the town. Wake died in August 2011, aged 98. Population Transportation =Air= There is a small airport from Montlu√ßon (Montlu√ßon - Gu√©ret Airport) with flights mainly for Paris, and a smaller aerodrome in Montlu√ßon itself (Montlu√ßon - Dom√©rat Aerodrome). The nearest international airports are Clermont-Ferrand Airport and Limoges Airport. =Road= Montlu√ßon is linked to French and European road networks, by three major routes: * the highway A71 from Orl√©ans to Clermont-Ferrand. * the national route to Clermont-Ferrand (E11) and to Bourges/Vierzon * the E62/RN145 joining Limoges to Moulins =Rail = Montlu√ßon-Ville railway station The Gare de Montlu√ßon-Ville railway station is served by three main passenger rail lines. * 'Montlu√ßon - Bourges - Vierzon - Paris' (fastest travel time to Paris: 3h08) * 'Montlu√ßon - Gannat - Clermont Ferrand' * 'Montlu√ßon - Gu√©ret - Saint-Sulpice-Lauri√®re - Limoges' (on the Lyon-Bordeaux line) =City buses= Montlu√ßon's local buses are run by Maelis. Sights The upper town, on the right bank of the Cher, consists of steep, narrow, winding streets, and preserves several buildings of the 15th and 16th centuries. The lower town, traversed by the Cher, is the industrial zone. The church of Notre-Dame dates from the fourteenth century, the church of St Pierre partly from the 12th. The town hall, with a library, occupies the site of an old Ursuline convent, and two other convents are used as a college and hospital. Overlooking the town is the castle rebuilt by Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, and taken by Henry IV during the French Wars of Religion; it serves as a barracks. =Monuments= * The Dukes of the Bourbon castle in Montlu√ßon, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries * Church of Notre-Dame, XVe * Church of Saint-Pierre, XIIe * Church of Saint-Paul, XIXe * Church of Sainte-Th√©r√®se, XXe * Church of Saint-Martin, XXe * Church of Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc, built in 1966 * Temple de l'Eglise R√©form√©e de France, (1888) * Tour des forges (or 'tour fondue'), XIIe si√®cle * Crown, XIIe * Maison des Douze ap√¥tres du XIIe * Museum of popular musiques * Town Hall, XIXe * Ancienne chapelle Saint-Louis * Passage du doyenn√© * Castle la Louvi√®re * Castle de Bien-Assis *Canal de Berry: locks, canal bridge =Culture= * Mus√©e des Musiques Populaires * Th√©√¢tre Municipal Gabrielle Robinne International relations =Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities= Montlu√ßon is twinned with: * Antsirabe, Madagascar * Guimar√£es, Portugal * Hagen, Germany * Igualada, Spain * Leszno, Poland Miscellaneous Administration: Montlu√ßon is a sub-prefecture and has courts, a board of trade arbitration, a chamber of commerce and several schools (general public, private, commercial).

It is however of much greater extent than the actual valley of the river, lying between the Cumbrian Mountains (more usually referred to as the Lake District), and the northern part of the Pennine Range. It lies entirely within the county of Cumbria. The river has its source in the peat bogs below Hugh Seat, in the dale of Mallerstang. At first it determinedly sets off South (as Hellgill Beck) before turning back North for the rest of its course - except just before its outlet into the sea which it enters from the East. The Eden passes through the market towns of Kirkby Stephen and Appleby-in-Westmorland, once the county capital of that area. It then bypasses, but remains close to, Penrith where it receives the waters of Ullswater via the River Eamont, its major tributary. Via some ancient villages and fine bridges it reaches and passes through Carlisle, the major city in this whole area. It then enters the sea where, together with the River Esk, coming down from the North, it forms the Solway Firth which divides Scotland from England on the Atlantic side of the country.

Lees escaped her attacker, but Falconio was never found, and in 2005 Murdoch was convicted of his murder. Lees was the chief crown witness in the subsequent murder trial of Bradley John Murdoch conducted in Darwin. She later wrote a 2006 book, and this was made into a television film, about her experiences. Early life Lees was born on 25 September 1973, and lived her first 11 years with her mother Jenny (who had separated from her father). Her mother then remarried Vincent, who already had a son named Sam, and the new family of four lived in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. During high school and later studies, she had several part-time jobs as a barmaid, and bacon packer, before securing a job at her local Thomas Cook travel agency. Lees first met Falconio in a nightclub in Huddersfield in 1996 and began living with him the following year in Brighton, England where Falconio was studying at Brighton University. She then transferred her job to a local Cook agency, before the couple took short trips to Italy, Greece and Jamaica. From 1998, the couple had planned a trip to Thailand, Singapore, and Australia (though recent news of the Backpacker Murders, Port Arthur killings, and Childers Palace Backpackers Hostel fire there had made their families anxious). On 15 November 2000, the couple departed, travelling through Nepal, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia (where Lees' traveller's cheques and return ticket were stolen). By 16 January 2001, they had arrived in Sydney on a working holiday visa, and Lees then job-hunted, finally securing work at the Dymocks bookstore on George Street. After five months, in which the couple had enjoyed Sydney's nightclub scene, Falconio purchased a car for the next stage of their travel plan, a road trip from Sydney to Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin and Brisbane. Falconio murder Falconio and Lees were travelling at night along the Stuart Highway near Barrow Creek (between Alice Springs and Tennant Creek) in the Northern Territory, outback Australia, on 14 July 2001, when a man in another vehicle flagged them down, and told them that he had noticed that their camper van had engine trouble. After Falconio went to the rear of the vehicle with the man to investigate, Lees heard a shot. The man then threatened Lees with a gun, and tied her up, but she escaped while he was distracted (apparently while moving Falconio's body). She hid for five hours in nearby bushes before running out onto the road and flagging down a truck driver who took her to safety. In the aftermath of attack, Lees was both supported and suspected by the media (as had happened in the Chamberlain case). Expert testimony presented at the trial indicated that Bradley Murdoch was the man captured in the CCTV footage at the service station. Lees identified Murdoch from police photographs shown to her in November 2002 by Northern Territory Police and finally face-to-face during the trial on 18 October 2005. This, combined with the DNA match on Lees' T-shirt, formed the case for Murdoch being charged with the murder. DNA testing procedure and this DNA result greatly assisted in the conviction of Murdoch. Murdoch was found guilty by a jury in a unanimous verdict. Media coverage Lees agreed to an interview with Martin Bashir, which was later televised in Australia, for which she was paid ¬£50,000. She later testified in court that she had agreed to this interview to raise awareness of the case in Australia, as she felt the public profile of the case had diminished. Lees wrote No Turning Back, a book about her life. She went to the UK for the launch of the book in October 2006 and a serialisation appeared in The Times newspaper on 2 and 3 October. A lengthy interview with Lees was aired on Andrew Denton's show, Enough Rope on 9 October 2006.Enough Rope with Andrew Denton - episode 124: Joanne Lees (09/10/2006) The same day, Lees was interviewed on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 by John Humphrys. On 10 October 2006, Lees was interviewed by BBC News 24. In July 2011, Lees was interviewed by Australia's Woman's Day in the lead-up to the tenth anniversary of the murder of Peter Falconio. She stated that she was still single and living a solitary life, and had worked at a travel agency and as a social worker with disabled people. She had also studied sociology at Sheffield University.

He will be 74 when eligible for parole in 2032. Murdoch is being held in Darwin Correctional Centre in Darwin, Northern Territory.Falconi murderer moved to Alice Springs Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 25 August 2007 He has lodged two appeals against his conviction; both of which were unsuccessful. The High Court of Australia refused special leave to appeal on 21 June 2007. He is forbidden to talk to the press.  Early life  Murdoch was born on 19 February 1958 in Geraldton, Western Australia, an unexpected third son (the others were aged 11 and 14) to parents Colin Murdoch (a mechanic) and Nancy Murdoch (a hairdresser). The family lived in nearby Northampton, before moving to Perth when he was 12 years old. Murdoch had problems adjusting to city life, and soon became involved with a biker gang. At 15 years old, he left high school and moved back to Geraldton where he started becoming involved in biker gang criminal activities. He also had his own trucking business, but declared bankruptcy in 1983. In 1980, he had met his partner Dianne, whom he married in July 1984 ‚Äì they had a son, but they were separated by 1986 due to domestic violence. He was then employed as a truck driver (and illicit-drug smuggler), and admitted in court to smuggling large amounts of cannabis. He also began to display white supremacist tendencies (particularly in the wake of the 1992 Mabo decision), alongside a racist tattoo. By 1998, after release from prison, he was living in Derby, running drugs, and driving road trains, before resettling in Broome and running drugs to Sedan.  Previous criminal charges  * In 1980, aged 21, Murdoch received a suspended sentence after being convicted of causing death by dangerous driving, after hitting and killing a motorcyclist. * In November 1995, Murdoch started a 21-month imprisonment for the 20 August 1995 drunken incident of shooting at people who were celebrating at an indigenous Australian rules football grand-final match in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia. He was released after 15 months. * In 2003, he was charged with seven counts of abduction and rape, but was acquitted of these charges.  Peter Falconio trial and incarceration  A Toyota Land Cruiser pick-up/ute with canopy similar to the one used by Bradley Murdoch Shortly after his acquittal for unrelated rape and abduction charges, Murdoch was arrested in 2003 and charged with the murder of Peter Falconio on a remote part of the Stuart Highway near Barrow Creek on 14 July 2001. The case was heard before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in Darwin, and began on 17 October 2005. Murdoch pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering Peter Falconio and assaulting and attempting to kidnap his girlfriend Joanne Lees. Murdoch was convicted on 13 December 2005 for Falconio's murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 28 years. He was also convicted of other assault-related charges on Joanne Lees. On 12 December 2006, he appealed against his life sentence in the Supreme Court, claiming the evidence of Lees was tainted because she had seen a photograph of him on the internet before she was interviewed by police, as well as an article linking him to the murder.Evidence questioned in Murdoch appeal Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 12 December 2006 The appeal was dismissed on 10 January 2007.Falconio killer loses appeal , Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 10 January 2007. In mid-August 2007, some sections of the Australian media speculated that Murdoch might soon reveal the whereabouts of Falconio's remains. Specifically, the press mentioned that Murdoch did not enjoy the conditions of the Berrimah Prison, on the outskirts of Darwin and might reveal the location of Falconio's body in exchange for a transfer to a prison in Western Australia, given that all avenues of appeal had been exhausted.Will outback's big murder secret be revealed? - National - theage.com.au An appeal to the High Court was unsuccessful.

It is located on the Stuart Highway, about 280 km north of Alice Springs, about halfway from there to Tennant Creek. The main feature of the town is the roadhouse/hotel. A number of mining companies are currently exploring in the area, although none of the current residents are involved in the mining industry. History =Indigenous people= The Barrow Creek area is the traditional home of the Kaytetye Aboriginal people. Humans have lived in Australia, and perhaps this area, for at least 40,000 years. =European settlement= With the arrival of Europeans in the latter part of the 19th century, settlers competed with the Kaytetye for land and resources. Cultural misunderstandings on land and property rights resulted in mutual killings. John McDouall Stuart passed through the area in 1860. He named a creek near the current town after John Henry Barrow, a preacher, journalist and politician who was born in England in 1817 and migrated to South Australia in 1853. At the time of first European habitation of the site, he was the Treasurer of South Australia. =Barrow Creek Telegraph Repeater Station= Barrow Creek was chosen as a site for an Overland Telegraph morse repeater station by John Ross in September 1871. The station was officially opened on 16 August 1872 by Charles Todd. It was one of 15 such repeater stations on a network traversing Australia and linking to Europe, providing essential communication services. A manned repeater station in newer buildings remained in operation until at least the 1970s. There was also a post office and telephone exchange servicing local cattle stations. The original Telegraph Station has been preserved and is now a monument to the troubles which beset the early days of the Territory. =Arrival of graziers in the area= In 1873, 5,000 sheep were overlanded from Adelaide by Alfred Giles for distribution to Telegraph Stations along the line. During 1877 and 1878 Alfred Giles and Arthur Giles overlanded stock for W. J. Browne to the Katherine River. On the 1878 journey Frank Withall, a young Englishman, was included on the suggestion of Browne to gather some colonial experience. Alfred Giles later started Springvale, Delamere and the Newcastle Waters runs. =Second World War= During the Second World War Barrow Creek was used by the Australian Army as a staging camp for convoys of troops and supplies, which was known as No. 5 Australian Personnel Staging Camp. It was the first overnight stop on the northern trip from Alice Springs to Birdum. =Water limits Barrow Creek population= Barrow Creek has always had a problem with both quantity and quality of groundwater supplies. This problem was already recognized in the 1870s, and only 20 years after the Telegraph Station was built there is evidence of plans to shift it about 40 kilometres further north to the crossing at Taylor Creek because of better groundwater supplies. There is still a bore at that locality called New Barrow Bore. Today, the only good water at Barrow Creek is rainwater and that is limited due to the arid climate. Crime =1870 killing= During 1870 some 3,000 sheep from the Lake Hope area in South Australia were overlanded to the Northern Territory, for the men working on the line at Roper River, by Ralph and John Milner. Near Wauchope Creek 900 sheep died after eating poisonous herbs. John Milner was killed by the Aborigines and Ralph arrived at the Roper River with only 1,000 sheep. =1874 Barrow Creek outrage and aftermath= On 22 February 1874, a group of Kaytetye men attacked the Overland Telegraph repeater station at Barrow Creek, whose staff were relaxing outside the compound, immediately killing linesman John Frank, mortally wounding Canadian telegraphist and stationmaster James Lawrence Stapleton (died on the following day) and injuring several others. A monument was erected at Barrow Creek to their memory (the spelling \\"Franks\\" is almost certainly incorrect). Contemporary press reports described the incident as the \\"Barrow's Creek outrage\\". On orders from Adelaide, police trooper Samuel Gason recruited a group of volunteers to apprehend the perpetrators. Several Aborigines were killed in two separate battles over the two months that followed, with Gason reporting that some of the dead had been identified as having taken part in the 'outrage'. Anthropologist Ted Strehlow reported in 1932 that Alex Ross, who'd visited the area in 1875, doubted whether the real culprits had been found. \\"Well of course nobody ever knew,\\" Ross was quoted as saying.Barry Hill, Broken Song, Knopf Book 2002 p.155. =1928 Coniston Massacre= Barrow Creek was central to the last major Aboriginal massacre in the Northern Territory. In the 1920s Mounted Constable William George Murray was in charge of the local police station and also the Chief Protector of Aborigines in the area. When an old dingo trapper, Fred Brooks, was killed by Aborigines on Coniston Station, Murray led a posse which killed an estimated 70 Aborigines in a series of bloody reprisals. When Murray was called to Darwin to explain his actions he was greeted as a conquering hero. When asked why he had taken no prisoners he expressed the racist attitudes which prevailed at the time by telling the Darwin court \\"What use is a wounded black feller a hundred miles from civilisation?\\" He was exonerated of all charges. =2001 Peter Falconio disappearance= Barrow Creek has recently become famous for being the closest town to the location of where Peter Falconio went missing, presumed murdered by Bradley John Murdoch, and Joanne Lees was abducted. The scene of the crime was 13 kilometres to the north of Barrow Creek. No body has ever been found. Tourist spots =The graves= The graves are marked by a wall around the graves and headstones. They are well looked after. In a small graveyard at the front are remains of two telegraph station workers killed in a surprise attack by Aboriginals in 1874. =The pub= The old pub was built in 1926 by Joe Kilgariff, uncle of Northern Territory senator Bernie Kilgariff, and it still has the original old bar, underground cellar and tin ceilings. There is accommodation outside and rooms inside and a caravan park. On the wall in the kitchen of the building is a cartoon of two Australian comic icons, Bluey and Curley, drawn by the artist John Gurneyhttp://www.oldcmp.net/bluey.html when he passed through during the Second World War. The hotel is a popular stop for travellers along the highway and contains a tremendous collection of memorabilia and items of interest which have been gathered over the years. The current publican of 25 years, Lesley Pilton, initiated what he terms the \\"Barrow Creek Bank\\" - travellers post on the wall a signed banknote of their native country, \\"to be used in a later journey in case they need a beer\\". =Telegraph Station= For many years the Telegraph Station was the home of Tom Roberts, a linesman from Charters Towers who lived in the building and repaired breakdowns of the line. Now deceased, a corner of the hotel is devoted to his memory.  Popular culture  Part of the Graham Masterton novel ‚Äò‚ÄôLords of the Air‚Äô‚Äô is set in Barrow Creek.  Climate  Current =Population= The population of Barrow Creek at the moment is 4 people who work at the roadhouse and nearby Aboriginal camp caretaker yard. There are two Aboriginal communities - the Tara community which is 12 km northeast and Pmatajunata at Stirling Station which is about 35 km from Barrow Creek. There are about 120 people there and 80 people at Tara. =Mining= *On 19 March 2001 Glengarry Resources NL were issued with an exploration licence for Tantalite in Barrow Creek. *On 17 November 2003 Barrow Creek Central Land Council agreed to allow Newmont Gold Exploration Pty Ltd and Normandy NFM Limited to use an area north-west of Barrow Creek for exploration and mining for a period of 20 years. *On 26 May 2005 BHP Billiton commenced drilling at Barrow Creek to explore and develop nickel sulphide deposits.

It is located off the State route of Mexico-Morelia-Guadalajara, about 12 km (7.5 mi) south of Mil Cumbres at an elevation of 2896 m (9501 ft) above mean sea level. Seasonal temperatures vary from 40‚Äì79 ¬∞F (4‚Äì26 ¬∞C) July to February and 60‚Äì89 ¬∞F (16‚Äì32 ¬∞C) March to June with relatively low humidity. There are almost no mosquitoes, snakes or other pests. History El Caracol is said to be one of the oldest villages in the region dating as far back to the mid-15th century. There are few records of its history, only tales of the native people that passed them on from generation to generation. Folk tales tell of a very painful separation caused by two priests. One decided to relocate the village because the terrain where it was located would not allow it to grow, and most of the people followed the priest to a valley now known as San Antonio Villalongin. The rivalry started when San Antonio's priest wanted to take all the church's belongings (saints and a three-ton gold-plated bell). There are accounts of trying to drag the four foot San Isidro Labrador statue out the temple and the statue would not fit out the door. After the unsuccessful robbery the evil priest walked up the mountain to La Cruz del Toro and cursed the town. In the late-1970s and 1980s, El Caracol was a major lumbermill center with up to 34 lumberyards, cabinetry, and bedboard making shops, producing thousands of woodcrafting products and distributing them throughout the Mexican Republic. The population of the village grew close to 5,000. The primary, tele-secondary schools, and a bigger temple were built to accommodate the increasing population. El Caracol has been a stepping stone. In the 1950s and 1960s people from the surrounding villages migrated to El Caracol, while the natives moved to Mexico City. Similarly in the 1980s and 1990s people from El Caracol started migrating to Morelia and the United States - especially to Los Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL; and Atlanta, GA - and people from surrounding villages such as La Palma, San Juan, El Astillero and others moved to El Caracol. Now there are only about 2,700 people left in the village, most of whom are under 15 or over 45 years old. A few left to Morelia to continue their studies and the majority are working in the United States. Traditions Traditional village ceremonies include a re-enactment of the Birth, Last Supper and the Passion of Christ. Another big tradition is the migration on July 16 the day of La Virgen Del Carmen.

The Sierra de la Plata (\\"Silver Mountains\\") was a mythical source of silver in the interior of South America. The legend began in the early 16th century when castaways from the Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s expedition heard indigenous stories of a mountain of silver in an inland region ruled by the so-called White King. The first European to lead an expedition in search of it was the castaway Aleixo Garcia, who crossed nearly the entire continent to reach the Andean altiplano. On his way back to the coast, Garcia died in an ambush by indigenous tribespeople in Paraguay, but survivors brought precious metals back to corroborate their story. The legend inspired other expeditions, all of which ended in failure. The R√≠o de la Plata (literally \\"Silver River\\") and the modern country of Argentina (from the Latin argentum, \\"silver\\") both take their names from the myth. The legend of the Sierra de la Plata may have been based on the Cerro Rico de Potos√≠ in Bolivia, which was discovered by a Spanish expedition traveling from Peru in 1545.  Origins of the Legend  = Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s = Map from the Miller Atlas (1519) showing the coast of Brazil and the mouths of the Amazon River and the R√≠o de la Plata. The legend of the White King and the Sierra de la Plata began with the expeditions of Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s along the coast of South America. On his first voyage in 1512,L√≥pez de G√≥mara, Francisco. Historia General de las Indias. Medina del Campo: 1553; Zaragoza: 1555. Sol√≠s followed the coast of Brazil until he came across an enormous estuary, the R√≠o de la Plata, which Amerigo Vespucci had named the River JordanGarc√≠a Mata, Rafael. \\"Hab√≠a un R√≠o Jordan al sur del Nuevo Mundo... y era el R√≠o de la Plata\\". La Naci√≥n [Buenos Aires, Argentina] 6 May 2001. on his 1501-02 expedition and the local inhabitants called Paranaguazu (\\"river like the sea\\" or \\"great water\\"). Sol√≠s decided to call it the Mar Dulce (\\"Freshwater Sea\\") due to its great size. After exploring the area and guessing it could be a strait connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific, Sol√≠s returned to Spain to stake his claim as conqueror and governor of the region. In 1516, he returned with the title of Captain General, but when Sol√≠s and his party landed on the eastern bank of the R√≠o de la Plata, they were attacked and killed by Guaran√≠s. Seeing this, the crew remaining on the ships decided to weigh anchor and return to Spain. = Aleixo Garcia = On their way back to Europe, one of the Sol√≠s expedition's vessels shipwrecked off the coast of Santa Catarina Island in what is now Brazil, leaving eighteen men stranded. One of them, the Portuguese explorer Aleixo Garcia, became friendly with the local Tup√≠-Guaran√≠s, and through them learned of a great mountain of shining metals far into the mainland. Garcia left Santa Catarina along with other castaways and a large indigenous party to search for the Sierra de la Plata, crossing most of South America before reaching the Andean altiplano. This was supposedly the home of the White King, whose throne was entirely decorated with silver. After taking a few valuable pieces, the explorers headed back to the Brazilian coast, but along the way, Aleixo Garcia and the other Europeans were killed in a Payagu√° ambush. The few Tup√≠-Guaran√≠s who managed to escape told their story, showing off the silver pieces they had gotten from the realms of the White King.  Search for Sierra de la Plata  = Sebastian Cabot = R√≠o de la Plata Basin In 1526, the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot left Spain with the goal of reaching the Molucca Islands in Indonesia by way of the Straits of Magellan. During a stopover in Pernambuco in northern Brazil, he first heard the story about a land rich in precious metals far inland, which could be reached via an enormous estuary further south. The estuary ended up being called the R√≠o de la Plata for its role as the supposed natural gateway to the treasure. The legend captivated Cabot, so he abandoned his mission and decided to find the Sierra de la Plata, assuming that the royal authorities would be indulgent if he found enough silver. On Santa Catarina, the castaways Melchor Rodr√≠guez and Enrique Morales confirmed the stories, telling Cabot about Aleixo Garcia's expedition and showing him the metals that had been brought back. Cabot headed toward R√≠o de la Plata, where he disembarked to repair two ships that had been damaged in a storm. There, the expedition met former cabin boy Francisco del Puerto, the sole survivor of Sol√≠s's landing party. Del Puerto, who was living with the Guaran√≠s, also verified the legend and offered his services as guide and interpreter. After entering the R√≠o de la Plata, the expedition divided in two: Cabot would continue up the Paran√° River and Ant√≥n de Grajeda would travel up the Uruguay River. In 1527, at the confluence of the Paran√° and Carcara√±√° Rivers, Cabot established the fort of Sancti Spiritu, the first European settlement in the R√≠o de la Plata basin, and a future base for expeditions to the land of the White King. The party was suffering from hunger and sickness, and since they could not travel by land, they continued north upriver until they landed at an island they named A√±o Nuevo (\\"New Year\\"). There, they traded colored glass with the Timb√∫s for food, but Cabot, thinking he had been shortchanged, ordered his men to kill them, burn their homes, and take their food. In February 1529, they reached an indigenous town they called Santa Ana, where they were treated hospitably, fed well, and told rumors of other \\"white men\\" who were coming up the river behind them. Cabot, however, stuck to his plan and continued up the Paraguay River until strong currents prevented him from going further. There, he had a brigantine sent ahead under the command of Miguel de Rifos. Near the confluence of the Pilcomayo River, Rifos decided to disembark with a few men after being welcomed by some indigenous people on the shore. The Europeans headed through the forest to the village, where they were unexpectedly ambushed. Supposedly, it was a trap arranged by the local chief and Del Puerto, who wanted a larger share of the plunder. Those who had stayed in the brigantine managed to escape, and when they returned to Cabot, he decided to head back to Sancti Spiritu. On the way, he came across Diego Garc√≠a, the \\"other white man\\" he had been told about. Garc√≠a, like Cabot, had been commissioned to travel to the Moluccas, but had deserted when he heard the tales of the White King. After a brief dispute, the two captains decided to join forces to find the Sierra de la Plata, with Cabot in charge of the unified fleet. At Sancti Spiritu, Captain Francisco C√©sar was chosen to explore the local region together with another fifteen soldiers. Three months later C√©sar returned with half of his men and a rumor that nearby was a great city full of riches that from then on would be known as the Ciudad de los C√©sares (\\"City of the Caesars\\"). The Sebastian Cabot expedition ended in failure when Cabot and Diego Garc√≠a made their next attempt to find the Sierra de la Plata. The local indigenous people took advantage of their absence to attack and destroy Fort Sancti Spiritu, killing many of his men. Low on morale, food, and supplies, Cabot and his crew were finally forced to give up their goal and return to Europe. = Pedro de Mendoza = Santa Mar√≠a de los Buenos Ayres, shortly after its foundation in 1536. In 1534, King Charles I authorized Pedro de Mendoza to \\"conquer and populate the lands and provinces around the Sol√≠s River, which some call the Plate\\". With fourteen ships and some 1,200 men, it was at the time the largest and most important expedition that had left Europe for America.Pigna, Felipe. \\"Fundaciones de Ciudades\\". El Historiador In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the port of Santa Mar√≠a de los Buenos Ayres, which was probably located in what is now the Parque Lezama in Buenos Aires. Resources were in short supply to support such a population, and after the Spaniards mistreated the local Querand√≠s, they stopped supplying food to the settlement. Mendoza decided to send out two fleets in search of food: the first, led by his nephew Gonzalo de Mendoza, headed toward Brazil, and the second, led by Juan de Ayolas, went up the River Paran√° with three ships and 270 men. Meanwhile, Mendoza ordered his brother Diego to take 300 soldiers and 30 cavalrymen to fight the Querand√≠s. The battle was a failure. Diego de Mendoza was killed, and the Querand√≠s began a long-lasting siege of Buenos Aires. Cut off from supplies, the settlers began to eat their horses and their dead. Finally, the Querand√≠s withdrew, and in a few days, the Juan de Ayolas expedition returned with the news that they had managed to build a fort called Corpus Christi upriver near the modern-day town of Gaboto and had encountered some indigenous people who talked about the Sierra de la Plata. Pedro de Mendoza decided to travel to the fort with Ayolas and some 400 men. During the voyage, some 200 men died of sickness and hunger, and once they reached Corpus Christi, Mendoza consulted Cabot's map to find that they were still far from their destination. These major setbacks, along with the syphilis he had contracted, convinced Mendoza to return to Europe after a short stop in Buenos Aires. Pedro de Mendoza died on the open sea on June 23, 1537. Juan de Ayolas, who had left Corpus Christi on October 14, 1536 with a fleet of three brigantines and 170 soldiers, inherited his title of adelantado. Meanwhile, Buenos Aires had overcome its famine thanks to provisions Gonzalo de Mendoza brought from Brazil, and was left under the provisional command of Captain Francisco Ruiz Gal√°n, who ordered the first planting of corn with the goal of making the fort self-sustainable. = Juan de Ayolas = The Pilcomayo river at Tarija, Bolivia. Before Pedro de Mendoza left Buenos Aires, having no news of the Ayolas expedition, he sent Juan de Salazar Espinosa upriver in search of him. On August 15, 1537, Espinosa established the fort of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n (today Asunci√≥n, Paraguay) at the junction of the rivers Paraguay and Pilcomayo. Meanwhile, Juan de Ayolas was further up the river Paraguay in Payagua territory, where he met one of Aleixo Garcia's former companions, who told him how difficult the journey had been, due to all the gold and silver that weighed them down. Hearing this story, Ayolas decided to found the port of Candelaria on the spot (close to present-day Corumb√°) and commissioned Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala as provisional Lieutenant Governor until he returned from an overland expedition with 130 soldiers. After a short time, with no news of Ayola, Irala decided to abandon his post and return downriver to the fort of Asunci√≥n. However, the Juan de Ayolas expedition had successfully reached a mountainous area where precious metals were mined. On his return trip, his party suffered losses from skirmishes with indigenous people, and before he reached the Paraguay River, he ordered his men to bury most of the treasure they carried. When he returned, he was disappointed to find the port of Candelaria abandoned, so he accepted the invitation of the Payaguas to rest in their village. On his way there, a fight broke out between the Spaniards and the local people, and almost the entire expedition was killed, including Juan de Ayolas. After this, Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala became the expedition's new leader, and he took up the goal of conquering the Sierra de la Plata and the lands of the White King. Irala decided to convert Asunci√≥n into the headquarters of the conquest, and ordered the colonists at Buenos Aires to tear down their buildings and move to Asunci√≥n. However, their newly planted corn was yielding a good crop, and they refused to move. Six months later, Irala disembarked at Buenos Aires to carry out the order. The first settlement at Buenos Aires was finally destroyed and abandoned in 1541. = √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca = Iguaz√∫ Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil. While Irala was preparing his expedition to the Sierra de la Plata, Spain had chosen √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca as the official successor to Pedro de Mendoza's title of adelantado. Known for his long residence among the Indians of modern-day Texas and northern Mexico, Cabeza de Vaca decided to cross Paraguay on foot rather than travel by boat up the R√≠o de la Plata. In October 1541, his expedition left Santa Catalina, crossing jungles, mountains, and rivers to reach Asunci√≥n. In January 1542, they passed Iguaz√∫ Falls and on March 11, 1542, they reached Asunci√≥n, where they met Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala. Cabeza de Vaca clashed with the colonists at Asunci√≥n, calling the village a \\"Moorish paradise,\\" as each colonist had taken multiple indigenous women as wives. Soon, Cabeza de Vaca began to prepare an expedition to the lands of the White King. First, he sent Irala up the Paraguay River to see if it led to the Sierra de la Plata. He reached La Gaiba Lake in the Pantanal region, where he founded the Puerto de los Reyes. In September 1543, Cabeza de Vaca led his own expedition through the forest, but sickness and clashes with his officers, mostly Irala's men, convinced him to abandon his search and return to Asunci√≥n. With his authority undermined and disliked by the colonists, the Captain General was soon overthrown. On April 25, 1544, Irala's men entered Cabeza de Vaca's house and took him prisoner. Eleven months later, he was sent to Spain on a ship under the command of Gonzalo de Mendoza. During the voyage, a violent storm broke out, which the superstitious sailors interpreted as divine punishment, so they decided to free all of their prisoners. In Spain, Cabeza de Vaca denounced the colonists' actions to the court, but the case was never resolved, and he never returned to the Americas. = Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala = View of modern-day Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. With his authority confirmed, Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala organized an expedition of 300 Spanish men and 3,000 indigenous men in search of the Sierra de la Plata. After a few battles with indigenous peoples, Irala's men reached a tribe of Macas√≠s, who immediately began speaking to them in Spanish. They told them their lord was Pedro Anzures, and therefore they were out of their jurisdiction. Irala sent a party to speak with the governor of Peru, Pedro de la Gasca, who only ordered the expedition to go no further under pain of death, so they had no choice but to return to Asunci√≥n. Irala organized several other expeditions to legendary locations like the \\"Land of Riches\\", the \\"Lake of El Dorado\\", and \\"Paititi\\". All of these expeditions ended in failure, with great cost in human lives and materials. Meanwhile, the king named Juan de Sanabria as the new adelantado in the region, but he died during preparations and was replaced by his son Diego, who ended up staying in Europe even though several of his ships had already sailed. Finally, the crown decided to formalize Irala's de facto power, so as Irala was preparing his next expedition, a royal emissary arrived in Asunci√≥n, informing Irala that he had been named governor of the Governorate of New Andalusia (also known as the Governorate of the R√≠o de la Plata and Paraguay) with express orders not to lead any more expeditions. With Buenos Aires destroyed and the Sierra de la Plata under another jurisdiction, Paraguay experienced a long period of isolation under Irala, who finally died in October 1556 at the age of 70.  Cerro Rico de Potos√≠  The Sierra de la Plata legend likely corresponds to the Cerro Rico de Potos√≠ in Bolivia, and the White King to the Inca Huayna C√°pac. When Aleixo Garcia explored the region and discovered precious metals in the early 16th century, Spain had barely begun colonizing the coasts of Panama and Colombia, and Portugal had barely begun colonizing the coast of Brazil. Neither of the two crowns knew about the existence of the Inca Empire until Francisco Pizarro encountered it in 1528, traveling from the Pacific coast. King Charles I tried to solve conflicts between conquistadors by dividing South America into several governorates: New Castile, under Francisco Pizarro, which reached from the Santiago River, Ecuador to Pisco, Peru; New Toledo, under Diego de Almagro, from Pisco to Taltal, Chile; and New Andalusia, under Pedro de Mendoza, two hundred leagues south. Of these three, it was Almagro's men who first found the Cerro Rico de Potos√≠, leaving New Andalusia without any claim to the Sierra de la Plata.

Michael Straczynski, who participated in a number of Internet venues to discuss elements of his work with his fans, including the rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 Usenet newsgroup, where he continued to communicate as late as March 2007.Straczynski's first fan-archived post, to GEnie, is from November 1991, and clearly references earlier discussions now lost to time. (See \\"Babylon 5 is the name of a particular place where our story takes place.\\" by J. Michael Straczynski, November 20, 1991. Archived at JMSNews.com, accessed September 3, 2007.) The first Google Groups-archived USENET post is from 1993 () This flow of information and feedback had a substantial impact on Babylon 5, as well as Straczynski's other shows and his fan base. This interaction pre-dated the coining of the term \\"blog\\", but is functionally similar. Internet usage =Forums = Babylon 5 was one of the first shows to employ Internet marketing to create publicity among online readers far in advance of the airing of the pilot episode. Straczynski participated in online communities on Usenet (in the rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated newsgroup), and the GEnie and Compuserve systems before the web came together as it exists today. Straczynski had long participated in many online forums since the 1980s, and is widely credited as being the first notable artist and celebrity to interact with fans online, even before the advent of the world wide web. This free interaction with his fans was not without its problems. A third- season episode (\\"Passing Through Gethsemane\\") was originally developed a year earlier in 1994 but had to be \\"scuttled\\" because a fan posted a story idea on GEnie that matched the plot of the episode. The story was not put back into the production pipeline until Straczynski could obtain a signed legal release from the fan. The moderated Usenet group was created as a consequence, specifically to filter out story ideas. Straczynski also asked fans not to engage in fan-fiction while the show was in production, and most fans complied with this request. On rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated, Straczynski regularly discussed with fans the process of creating and producing the show, the meaning of the work, and the development of the plot. He confirmed or denied fan theories and interpretations of the show, and answered questions ‚Äì though often cryptically. In November 1995, Straczynski temporarily left the newsgroup due to an increasing number of flames, but returned in December when a process was put in place to filter the threads that reached him. =Fan sites= Babylon 5 also inspired a number of fan sites. One of the first was The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5. It was noticed by The Washington Post and acknowledged by Straczynski in a Season 5 DVD commentary. Its root URL at the time, Hyperion, was used on the show as the name of a heavy cruiser. It also received early news from the show's copyright holders. =Internet marketing= In 1995, Warner Bros. started the Official Babylon 5 web site which was hosted on the now defunct Pathfinder portal. In September 1995 they hired a fan, Troy Rutter, to take over the site and move it not only to its own domain name at www.babylon5.com, but also to oversee the \\"Keyword B5\\" area on America Online. The fans continued to play an important role in the development of the series and the online support campaign is credited with helping persuade former PTEN station owners to carry the fourth season of the show in 1996. Over the course of the series, Warner Bros. encouraged the use of pictures and images on fan web sites, and eventually created a home-page community called AcmeCity where users could create a homepage using logos and graphics without fear of lawsuits. Also during this time, Warner Bros. executive Jim Moloshok created and distributed electronic trading cards to help advertise the series. A contest was conducted in conjunction with Sound Source Interactive called the Mystery Alien Sweepstakes, with the grand-prize to portray an alien on the show. Fan influences *The Babylon 5 pilot, The Gathering, originally featured music by former Police drummer Stewart Copeland. After B5 was greenlighted Straczynski solicited suggestions on GEnie for a replacement composer. After some suggested Tangerine Dream member Christopher Franke, that musician was eventually hired.GEnie SFRT thread archive of JMS posts only . Accessed September 3, 2007. *Straczynski hired John E. Hudgens, a fan of the show, and later the Babylon 5 section sysop on GEnie, to create promotional music videos for the show after seeing the original one Hudgens did on his own. They collaborated on a total of eight, and Straczynski would often use one as his introduction at convention appearances. Straczynski commissioned the fifth one (Welcome to the Third Age) to be his pitch reel to sell the show to TNT. *The spatial location of the B5 station itself is stated as ‚ÄúGrid Epsilon coordinates: 470/18/22.‚Äù This came about because Straczynski was touched by an outpouring of support from the GEnie Science Fiction and Fantasy RoundTable (SFRT) community in regards to a potential letter-writing campaign that turned out not to be needed after all. He was still grateful, however, and asked how he could show his appreciation. An SFRT participant suggested placing the station at the 3D spatial coordinates corresponding to the GEnie Page (#470, for original SFRT), CATegory (#18, for Non-Trek SFTV Series), and TOPic (#22, for Babylon 5) of what was then the only official B5 Topic on GEnie (the strange capitalization of CATegory and TOPic is because GEnie was command line-based and allowed commands to be abbreviated to three letters). Straczynski agreed and added that info to the series bible used by episode writers. The ‚ÄúGrid Epsilon‚Äù part was his own touch, based on the first two letters (which were usually both capitalized) of GEnie itself (since it was originally a GE (General Electric) property).GEnie SFRT thread archive of JMS posts only (posts from others removed). Accessed March 25, 2008. *B5 fans on GEnie referred to themselves as \\"Grid Epsilon Irregulars\\". *A fictional chemical substance called Quantium-40 was mentioned after Straczynski conducted a contest online to name the substance. *A Fresh Aire Restaurant waiter was named David after David Strauss, who came up with the name Quantium-40. Another character was named after a fan who helped raise money when one of the actors had not been paid for his conference attendance. *Babylon 5 fans on the Internet have popularized the \`<*>\` symbol (\\"the ASCII Jumpgate\\") as a sort of \\"secret handshake\\" to recognize each other online. In 1994, a birthday card for Straczynski was sent around the U.S. to many of the avid posters on the rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon-5 newsgroup. While the card was being circulated, clues were given on the newsgroup, denoted by the symbol \`<*>\`, and the jumpgate symbol continued to be used thereafter, even appearing on fan-produced jewelry.

","title":"Political statement"},{"id":"1921594","text":"Ken Uston (January 12, 1935 ‚Äì September 19, 1987) was an American blackjack player, strategist and author, credited with popularizing the concept of team play at blackjack. During the early to mid-1970s he gained widespread notoriety for perfecting techniques to do team card counting in numerous casinos worldwide, earning millions of dollars from the casinos, with some bets as high as $12,000 on a single hand. He was banned from casinos around the world and would adopt various costumes in order to conceal his identity and still be able to play. He filed a high-profile lawsuit against these casinos and successfully received a ruling from the New Jersey courts that absent a valid New Jersey Casino Commission regulation excluding card counters, casinos could not ban someone simply for counting cards at blackjack. In response, many casinos changed their systems, increasing the number of decks in games or changing rules to increase the house edge. In the early 1980s, Uston also authored several popular books on video games and personal computers. He was the subject of a 1981 segment on 60 Minutes and in 2005, he was the subject of the History Channel documentary, \\"The Blackjack Man\\". History Uston was born Kenneth Senzo Usui in New York City, the oldest of three children born to Elsie Lubitz, a native of Austria and Senzo Usui, a Japanese immigrant and businessman. At the age of 16, Uston was accepted to and henceforth began attending Yale University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Shortly after graduating from Yale, he earned an MBA from Harvard University. He became district manager of the Southern New England Telephone Co., then a senior management consultant with Cresap, McCormick & Paget in San Francisco, where he relocated with his wife and two daughters. After several years in consulting, he became corporate planning manager for American Cement in Los Angeles before returning to San Francisco where he became a Senior Vice-President at the Pacific Stock Exchange. On weekends, beginning in his years at Cresap, he read Thorp's Beat the Dealer and began to spend time in the casinos, becoming what the Cleveland Plain Dealer called \\"a genius card-counter\\". Uston was also a talented musician, proficient on the bass as well as the piano. He was frequently asked to play in several San Francisco jazz clubs. =Blackjack= In a 1983 Blackjack Forum interview, Uston related that he became fascinated by blackjack and its inherent strategies after meeting professional gambler Al Francesco in a poker game. Francesco had recently launched the first \\"big player\\" type of blackjack card counting team, and he recruited Uston to be one of his main team players. Their system was that members of the team would play at different tables around a casino, counting cards. When a count became extremely positive, they would flag the \\"big player\\" member of the team who would come in and place large bets. This technique would prevent the increased bet spread from being noticed by the pit bosses. On his first five-day run, the team won $44,100, of which Uston's share was $2,100. After two months of being a counter, Uston was promoted to \\"Big Player\\". Although Al Francesco and other team members have recounted in subsequent Blackjack Forum interviews that Uston made very little money for their team, Uston co-authored with Roger Rapoport a book entitled The Big Player in which he shared credit for many of his card-counting successes with his fellow team members, including noted Blackjack master- strategist Bill Erb. Soon after the publication of Uston's book, it is reported that Al Francesco's team found itself effectively barred from playing in Las Vegas. In 1978, the year legal gambling began in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Uston moved to the area and formed a profitable blackjack team of his own (discussed at length in a 2005 Blackjack Forum interview with team member Darryl Purpose). As with most other casinos around the globe, Uston was soon barred from playing at those locations within Atlantic City as well. After he was barred in January 1979 by Resorts International, he filed a lawsuit, claiming that casinos did not have the right to bar skilled players. In Uston v. Resorts International Hotel Inc., 445 A.2d 370 (N.J. 1982),Summary of Uston v. Resorts International Hotel, Inc. the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that Atlantic City casinos did not have the authority to decide whether card counters could be barred absent a valid New Jersey Casino Commission regulation excluding card counters. To date, New Jersey casinos‚Äîby statute‚Äîare not allowed to bar them. In response to Uston's legal victory, Atlantic City casinos began adding decks, moving up shuffle points, and taking other measures to decrease a skilled player's potential advantage. After his numerous casino barrings‚Äînow on his own and without a team‚ÄîUston adopted a wide variety of physical disguises in order to continue to play blackjack. He was also known for his aggressive approach along with his flamboyant playing style. In an article in Blackjack Forum, Arnold Snyder describes playing with Ken Uston at Circus Circus Las Vegas near the end of Uston's life. He states that Uston was disguised as a worker from Hoover Dam and got away with spreading his bets from table minimum to table maximum on a single-deck game. Since this took place at a time when card counting was well understood by casino executives and managers, and since the primary clue by which casinos detect card counting is a card counter's \\"bet spread\\" pattern, most card counters would also consider Uston a genius of disguise, and/or \\"card counting camouflage\\". After The Big Player, Uston wrote Million Dollar Blackjack. This book includes details about professional gamblers' techniques for gaining an advantage at the game. Uston also authored a companion piece, Ken Uston on Blackjack. =Video games and computers= In an interview published in Video Games, Uston revealed he got hooked on the games Pong and then Breakout. In 1979 Space Invaders became his video game of choice and, after his blackjack team made $350,000 in Atlantic City, they rented a house in California and bought a Space Invaders machine. The game appealed to him in part because of the trick of counting one's shots to get the maximum number of points for the spaceship at the top of the screen. In 1981, Uston began frequenting the Easy Street Pub near the Playboy Casino in Atlantic City. It was there he began a competition with some other regulars for having the high score on the bar's Pac-Man arcade game. He realized the game had patterns and, in order to gain an advantage, he began experimenting and writing them down on diagrams of the maze he had created, but he was unable to go beyond a certain level. On a trip back to San Francisco, he came across two Chinese-American boys by the names of \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Raymond\\" who taught him how to go further in the game. People had been telling Uston he should write a book about Pac-Man, but he had felt he didn't have enough knowledge. After receiving lessons from the two boys, Uston decided to go ahead with the book, titled Mastering Pac-Man, and wrote it in four days. It appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list. Uston wrote several more books about video games and home computers during the 1980s. He also licensed his name to Coleco for the ColecoVision game, Ken Uston's Blackjack/Poker. In 1983, Screenplay published software titled for the Apple II series, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, and IBM PC to assist in the learning and practice of Uston's relatively complex, yet highly accurate card- counting techniques. He was also credited with the idea for the 1984 game Puzzle Panic. =Death= On the morning of September 19, 1987, Ken Uston, age 52, was found dead in his rented apartment in Paris. The cause of death was listed as heart failure.Obituary from Blackjack Forum Magazine ‚Äì 1 December 1987 Bibliography =Blackjack= *The Big Player, 1977 () *One Third of a Shoe *Million Dollar Blackjack, 1981, Carol Publishing Group.

Heald, 544 U.S. 460 (2005), was a court case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in a 5‚Äì4 decision that ruled that laws in New York and Michigan that permitted in-state wineries to ship wine directly to consumers but prohibited out-of-state wineries from doing the same were unconstitutional. The case was unusual because the arguments centered on the rarely-invoked Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1933, which ended Prohibition in the United States. Background Granholm v. Heald was the conclusion of an eight-year fight by small wineries against such laws. Although direct shipments to consumers constituted only about 2% of wine sales in the United States, whose total sales were $21.6 billion in 2003), direct sales were thought to be an opportunity for growth. Laws varied from state to state, but typically, a winery could distribute wine only by selling it to a wholesaler in the state. Retailers were then required to purchase from the wholesalers. That made the large wholesalers very powerful in the wine industry since if wholesalers in New York decided not to purchase wine from a particular winery, that winery would be completely shut out of the New York market. Arguments The court case, which was a consolidation of two separate lawsuits, pitted the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine, inferred from the Constitution's Article I, against Section 2 of the Twentt-First Amendment, which reads: :The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited. The Commerce Clause of Article 1 of the Constitution grants Congress the power: :To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. In turn, the Dormant Commerce Clause (DCC) has been inferred from the Commerce Clause. The DCC is a doctrine that had evolved over many decisions of the US Supreme Court that states do not have the power to enact anticompetitive laws that discriminate against sellers in other states without the permission of Congress. Eleanor Heald, a wine collector, and eleven other plaintiffs, argued that Michigan's Liquor Control Code violated the DCC by making it a misdemeanor for an out-of-state winery to ship wine directly to a Michigan resident but did not prohibit direct shipping by in- state wineries. The same argument was made in a separate case against the government of New York State by Juanita Swedenburg and other owners of out-of- state wineries. In both cases, the state governments of Michigan and New York had argued that Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment granted them carte blanche to regulate liquor. One of their justifications for the laws was that by regulating out-of-state wineries that way, they might be able to hinder the shipment of alcohol to underage minors, which would serve a valid state purpose. The government of New York had won in the federal Second Circuit Court, and the government of Michigan had lost in the Sixth Circuit. The cases were consolidated and heard together by the US Supreme Court. In a 5‚Äì4 decision, the Supreme Court decided the states' laws were unconstitutional. The context of the Twenty-First Amendment was to return to the status quo that had existed before Prohibition. The Court made it clear that states have the power to regulate alcohol however they wished, including banning alcoholic beverages entirely within the state. Before Prohibition, the states did not have the power to violate the Dormant Commerce Clause, and the Twenty-First Amendment was not intended to grant them that power. Aftermath Michigan's liquor control board announced that it would recommend to the state government to ban all direct wine sales to consumers, which would join the 15 other states that currently ban all such sales. New York Governor George Pataki unveiled a bill that would limit each winery's direct sales to consumers to two cases per month per consumer. As a Wall Street Journal editorial noted, two cases per month is a relatively-large amount of wine for a consumer, but the measure was intended to reduce competition for New York alcohol distributors. New York State enacted a bill in 2006 that allows direct shipment of wine to consumers on a reciprocal basis. New York residents can purchase wine that is shipped from a state that grants New York wineries the same rights. Since the ruling, many more states have allowed direct shipping from wineries. According to the Wine Institute, a public policy advocacy association of California wineries, 37 states permitted at least some form of direct shipping from wineries to consumers, as of July 2010. Different states have enacted different regulations. An editorial article on the commercial wine selling web site Appelation America states that many of the conditions in those regulations are so complex or so expensive that they discourage wineries from complying. In March 2011, a bill was introduced in the US House of Representatives that would explicitly allow states to regulate alcohol products from outside of the state differently from those produced within the state.

In a 14-season career, he batted .245 with 271 home runs and 919 RBIs in 1800 games. Brunansky averaged 24 home runs per 162 games. He finished his career with 1543 hits in 6289 at bats, 69 stolen bases, and 306 doubles. Professional career After being drafted in the 1st round (14th pick) of the 1978 amateur draft by the California Angels organization after his senior year at West Covina High School in California, Brunansky spent the next four years working his way up the Angels' minor league system before appearing in 11 games in 1981 after making his major league debut on 19 April. On May 11, 1982, he was traded by the Angels, along with pitcher Mike Walters, to the Minnesota Twins for pitcher Doug Corbett and infielder Rob Wilfong. The 21-year-old Brunansky was then inserted into the Twins' line up where he saw time at all three outfield positions and slugged his way to the first of his 8 consecutive seasons in which he hit at least 20 home runs. Following the 1982 season, Brunansky became a fixture in right field for the Twins starting there through the 1987 season. In 1982, Brunansky became the only Twin in franchise history to hit a grand slam, inside-the-park home run. He accomplished this in a July 19 home game at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in the 3rd inning off the Brewers' Jerry Augustine. Ironically, all four runs were considered unearned because of two Brewers' fielding errors earlier in the inning. Only 40 major league players have hit a grand slam, inside-the-park home run since 1950. He was the Twins sole All-Star representative in 1985 and was a starter for the World Champion 1987 Minnesota Twins during what was arguably his best overall season (hitting .259, with 32 HR, 85 RBI and 83 Runs). Brunansky helped the Twins upset the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series by hitting .412 with 2 home runs and 9 RBI in the 5-game series. He then had a somewhat invisibile World Series, only hitting .200 with one RBI. Just months after playing each other in the World Series, the Twins shocked both their fans and Tom Brunansky by trading him on 22 April 1988 to the St. Louis Cardinals for second baseman Tom Herr. Although the move was meant to strengthen the top of the order, Herr spent one lackluster season with the Twins in which he complained about being in Minnesota, while Brunansky continued his home run hitting ways for six more seasons. On May 4, 1990, he was traded by the Cardinals to the Red Sox for closer Lee Smith. Brunansky played three seasons for the Red Sox, and is best remembered by Boston fans for his diving catch of an Ozzie Guill√©n line drive in the ninth inning of the season ending game that preserved the Red Sox victory, sending them to the 1990 ALCS. However, Brunansky hit .083, and the team as a whole hit a pitiful .183, as the Oakland A's swept the Sox in 4 games (before being swept themselves by the Cincinnati Reds in the 1990 World Series). At the end of the 1992 season, he became a free agent and signed with the Milwaukee Brewers on 28 January, 1993. Brunansky struggled with the Brewers, batting just .183 with six home runs over 80 games that season. He played only 16 games the following season before being traded back to the Red Sox on June 16, 1994, for Dave Valle. He put up decent power numbers in Boston, hitting 10 doubles and 10 home runs in 48 games, but the strike-shortened 1994 season would be his last in the majors. Retirement Following retirement, Brunansky was hired in 2004 as the coach for the Poway High School baseball team in Poway, California. In July 2010 after finishing his sixth season at Poway, Brunansky accepted a job as the hitting coach for the Twins' Rookie League team, the Gulf Coast League Twins. At the end of the season, he was promoted to be the hitting coach for the Twins' AA League team, the New Britain Rock Cats. On November 1, 2011, Brunansky was again promoted to become the hitting coach for the Rochester Red Wings where he would help the team to their best season since 2008, finishing 72-72. On October 22, 2012, Brunansky was promoted to be the Twins' hitting coach. He was fired after the 2016 season. On May 9, 2012, the Boston Red Sox honored Brunansky for his diving catch that helped the Red Sox clinch the AL East in 1990.

Kappes (born August 22, 1951) was the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (DDCIA), until his resignation on April 14, 2010. He had served in the CIA since 1981, with a two-year hiatus. A career clandestine operations professional, Kappes supervised the extraordinary rendition program, a non-judicial system of rendering persons suspected of terrorism to secret locations where most of them were interrogated. Kappes also helped persuade Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi to abandon his nuclear weapons program in 2003.Mayer, Jane (2009), \\"The Secret History\\", The New Yorker, June 22, 2009, pg 54. In 2009, Kappes was convicted in absentia by an Italian court for his headquarters-based role in the rendition and torture of an Egyptian citizen who was kidnapped from Italian soil by the CIA. Education and military service Kappes earned a Bachelor of Science degree in pre-medicine from Ohio University and a Master of Science degree in pathology from Ohio State University. He served as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1976 to 1981. CIA career (1981‚Äì2004) Kappes joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1981 and has held a variety of operational assignments in Europe, Middle East and managerial positions at CIA Headquarters. Kappes has been station chief in New Delhi, Frankfurt, Kuwait City and Moscow from 1996 to 1999. He also served in Pakistan.Mayer, Op. cit. Kappes served as Chief of the Near East and South Asia Division from 1999 to 2000. Kappes served as Associate Deputy Director of Operations for Counterintelligence from 2000 to 2002, then as associate deputy director (ADDO) under Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) James Pavitt till 2004. =Libya negotiations= Towards the end of his tenure with the CIA, he worked with President George W. Bush in negotiations with Libya that ended that country's weapons-of-mass-destruction (WMD) programs. In a joint diplomatic mission with the United Kingdom's MI6 head of counter terrorism Sir Mark Allen, the pair engaged with Libya's secret service head (Moussa Koussa, who later defected to the UK), which resulted in an end of support for terrorist activity by Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi‚Äôs Libya, and a resultant end of international sanctions against Libya. =Deputy Director of Operations= Kappes was named Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) for the CIA in June 2004 and took office in August 2004 while the appointment of Porter Goss as the next Director of Central Intelligence was still pending in the Senate. Kappes succeeded James Pavitt, who resigned in June 2004. Both Kappes and Pavitt (and others) oversaw the CIA‚Äôs Directorate for Operations during the controversial Iraq WMD reporting. He served in that position until he resigned in November 2004. John E. McLaughlin, the then-Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, announced his departure the same week Kappes quit, thus exacerbating the rumored management problems for Goss. =Dramatic departure in 2004= It had been widely reported in the press that Kappes quit the Agency rather than carry out a request by Goss to reassign Michael Sulick, his then deputy.Mark Mazzetti, 'A Storied Operative Returns to the C.I.A.', New York Times, May 30, 2006 It is also reported that this incident occurred because Goss's chief of staff admonished the then assistant Deputy Director for Counterintelligence, Mary Margaret Graham ‚Äì who later worked for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Negroponte ‚Äì about leaking personnel information. According to some news reports, Sulick had engaged in a shouting match with Goss's chief of staff. For a brief period in between his appointments at the CIA, Kappes worked in the private security industry. In April 2005, ArmorGroup, a British security firm, named him vice president in charge of global strategy, and named him Chief Operating Officer (COO) in November 2005. Second CIA tour (2006‚Äì2010) Kappes was named as the next DDCIA by Negroponte in May 2006. Kappes was believed to be the preferred choice for Director of the CIA in the incoming Obama administration by Senators Jay Rockefeller, the outgoing chairman, and Dianne Feinstein, the incoming chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Instead, Leon Panetta was appointed to the position in February 2009, and Kappes was retained as DDCIA, the latter a condition set by Feinstein in exchange for her support for the former. Mayer, Op. ct. =Convicted of kidnapping, extraordinary rendition and torture= On November 4, 2009, in a landmark ruling, Italian judge Oscar Magi convicted 22 American CIA operatives of kidnapping Muslim cleric Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, known as Abu Omar, from the streets of Milan in 2003. Most of the top CIA officers had left the agency, with the exception of Kappes, who at the time was the assistant director of the CIA's clandestine branch. =Role in hiding detainee death= Per official reports, Kappes was responsible for the alteration of records regarding the death of a detainee at the 'Salt Pit', a secret CIA interrogation operation in Afghanistan. A detainee froze to death, after having been showered with water, and left outside overnight. Kappes made certain that the death was retained 'off the books'. According to two former officials who read a CIA inspector general's report on the incident, Kappes coached the base chief‚Äîwhose identity is being withheld at the request of the CIA‚Äîon how to respond to the agency's investigators. They would report it as an accident. =Sudden retirement, no explanation= On April 14, 2010, CIA Director Leon E. Panetta reported that Kappes would be retiring in May. The odd timing of the retirement, and lack of Presidential thanks for his years of service, led many to comment that this was a departure in disgrace.

By 1847, he had built about one-third of the railways in Britain, and by time of his death in 1870 he had built one in every twenty miles of railway in the world. This included three-quarters of the lines in France, major lines in many other European countries and in Canada, Australia, South America and India. He also built the structures associated with those railways, including docks, bridges, viaducts, stations, tunnels and drainage works. As well as railway engineering, Brassey was active in the development of steamships, mines, locomotive factories, marine telegraphy, and water supply and sewage systems. He built part of the London sewerage system, still in operation today, and was a major shareholder in Brunel's The Great Eastern, the only ship large enough at the time to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable across the North Atlantic, in 1864. He left a fortune of over ¬£5 million,http://www.royprecious.co.uk/460144/portrait-of-thomas- brassey-c1830-english-school/ equivalent to about ¬£600 million in 2020.https://www.in2013dollars.com/uk/inflation/1870?amount=1  Background  The Brassey family traced themselves back to a Norman ancestor from the town of Br√©cey in Lower Normandy who crossed to England with William the Conqueror in 1066. Initially their home was at Bulkeley, near Malpas in Cheshire, where they lived for nearly 600 years. At some time, and certainly by 1663, the family moved to Manor Farm in Buerton, a small settlement in the parish of Aldford, south of Chester. Thomas Brassey was the eldest son of John Brassey, a prosperous farmer, and his wife Elizabeth.  Early years  Thomas Brassey in 1830 Thomas Brassey was educated at home until the age of 12, when he was sent to The King's School in Chester. Aged 16, he became an articled apprentice to a land surveyor and agent, William Lawton. Lawton was the agent of Francis Richard Price of Overton, Flintshire. During the time Brassey was an apprentice he helped to survey the new Shrewsbury to Holyhead road (this is now the A5), assisting the surveyor of the road. While he was engaged in this work he met the engineer for the road, Thomas Telford. When his apprenticeship ended at the age of 21, Brassey was taken into partnership by Lawton, forming the firm of \\"Lawton and Brassey\\". Brassey moved to Birkenhead where their business was established. Birkenhead at that time was a very small place; in 1818 it consisted of only four houses. The business flourished and grew, extending into areas beyond land surveying. At the Birkenhead site a brickworks and lime kilns were built. The business either owned or managed sand and stone quarries in Wirral. Amongst other ventures, the firm supplied the bricks for building the custom house for the port which was developing in the town. Many of the bricks needed for the growing city of Liverpool were supplied by the brickworks and Brassey devised new methods of transporting his materials, including a system similar to the modern method of palletting, and using a gravity train to take materials from the quarry to the port. When Lawton died, Brassey became sole manager of the company and sole agent and representative for Francis Price. It was during these years that he gained the basic experience for his future career.; ; ; Haynes, pp. 57‚Äì58.  Early contracts in Britain  Brassey's first experiences of civil engineering were the construction of of the New Chester Road at Bromborough,Haynes, p. 58. and the building of a bridge at Saughall Massie, on the Wirral. During that time he met George Stephenson, who needed stone to build the Sankey Viaduct on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Stephenson and Brassey visited a quarry in Storeton, a village near Birkenhead, following which Stephenson advised Brassey to become involved in building railways. Brassey's first venture into railways was to submit a tender for building the Dutton Viaduct on the Grand Junction Railway, but he lost the contract to William Mackenzie, who had submitted a lower bid. In 1835 Brassey submitted a tender for building the Penkridge Viaduct, further south on the same railway, between Stafford and Wolverhampton, together with of track. The tender was accepted, the work was successfully completed, and the viaduct opened in 1837. Initially the engineer for the line was George Stephenson, but he was replaced by Joseph Locke, Stephenson's pupil and assistant. During this time Brassey moved to Stafford. Penkridge Viaduct still stands and carries trains on the West Coast Main Line., On completion of the Grand Junction Railway, Locke moved on to design part of the London and Southampton Railway and encouraged Brassey to submit a tender, which was accepted. Brassey undertook work on the section of the railway between Basingstoke and Winchester, and on other parts of the line. The following year Brassey won contracts to build the Chester and Crewe Railway with Robert Stephenson as engineer and, with Locke as the engineer, the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway and the Sheffield and Manchester Railway.  Early contracts in France  Opening ceremony of the Rouen and Le Havre Railway in 1844 Following the success of the early railways in Britain, the French were encouraged to develop a railway network, in the first place to link with the railway system in Britain. To this end the Paris and Rouen Railway Company was established, and Locke was appointed as its engineer. He considered that the tenders submitted by French contractors were too expensive, and suggested that British contractors should be invited to tender. In the event only two British contractors took the offer seriously, Brassey and William Mackenzie. Instead of trying to outbid each other they tendered jointly, and their tender was accepted in 1841. This set a pattern for Brassey, who from then on worked in partnership with other contractors in most of his ventures. Between 1841 and 1844 Brassey and Mackenzie won contracts to build four French railways, with a total mileage of , the longest of which was the Orl√©ans and Bordeaux Railway. Following the French revolution of 1848 there was a financial crisis in the country and investment in the railways almost ceased. This meant that Brassey had to seek foreign contracts elsewhere. Barentin Viaduct after rebuilding = The collapse of the Barentin Viaduct = In January 1846, during the building of the long Rouen and Le Havre line, one of the few major structural disasters of Brassey's career occurred, the collapse of the Barentin Viaduct. The viaduct was built of brick at a cost of about ¬£50,000 and was high. The reason for the collapse was never established, but a possible cause was the nature of the lime used to make the mortar. The contract stipulated that this had to be obtained locally, and the collapse occurred after a few days of heavy rain. Brassey rebuilt the viaduct at his own expense, this time using lime of his own choice. The rebuilt viaduct still stands and is in use today.; ; Haynes, pp. 59‚Äì60.  \\"Railway mania\\"  During the time Brassey was building the early French railways, Britain was experiencing what was known as the \\"railway mania\\", when there was massive investment in the railways. Large numbers of lines were being built, but not all of them were built to Brassey's high standards. Brassey was involved in this expansion but was careful to choose his contracts and investors so that he could maintain his standards. During the one year of 1845 he agreed no less than nine contracts in England, Scotland and Wales, with a mileage totalling over . In 1844 Brassey and Locke began building the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway of , which was considered to be one of their greatest lines. It passed through the Lune Valley and then over Shap Fell. Its summit was high and the line had steep gradients, the maximum being 1 in 75. To the south the line linked by way of the Preston‚ÄìLancaster line to the Grand Junction Railway. Two important contracts undertaken in 1845 were the Trent Valley Railway of and the Chester and Holyhead line of . The former line joined the London and Birmingham Railway at Rugby to the Grand Junction Railway south of Stafford providing a line from London to Scotland which bypassed Birmingham. The latter line provided a link between London and the ferries sailing from Holyhead to Ireland and included Robert Stephenson's tubular Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait. Also in 1845 Brassey received contracts for the Caledonian Railway which linked the railway at Carlisle with Glasgow and Edinburgh, covering a total distance of and passing over Beattock Summit. His engineer on this project was George Heald. That same year he also began contracts for other railways in Scotland, and in 1846 he started building parts of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway between Hull and Liverpool, across the Pennines. A contract for the Great Northern Railway was agreed in 1847, with William Cubitt as engineer-in-chief, although much of the work was done by William's son Joseph, who was the resident engineer. Brassey was the sole contractor for the line of . A particular problem was met in the marshy country of The Fens in providing a firm foundation for the railway and associated structures. Brassey was assisted in solving the problem by one of his agents, Stephen Ballard. Rafts or platforms were made of layers of faggot- wood and peat sods. As these sank, they dispersed the water and so a firm foundation was made., This line is still in use and forms part of the East Coast Main Line. Also in 1847 Brassey began to build the North Staffordshire Railway. By this time the \\"railway mania\\" was coming to an end and contracts in Britain were becoming increasingly more difficult to find. By the end of the \\"railway mania\\", Brassey had built one-third of all the railways in Britain.  Expansion in Europe  Following the end of the \\"railway mania\\" and the drying up of contracts in France, Brassey could have retired as a rich man. Instead he decided to expand his interests, initially in other European countries. His first venture in Spain was the Barcelona and Matar√≥ Railway of in 1848. In 1850 he undertook his first contract in the Italian States, a short railway of , the Prato and Pistoia Railway. This was to lead to bigger contracts in Italy, the next being the Turin‚ÄìNovara line of in 1853, followed by the Central Italian Railway of . In Norway, with Sir Morton Peto and Edward Betts, Brassey built the Oslo to Bergen Railway of which passes through inhospitable terrain and rises to nearly . In 1852 he resumed work in France with the Mantes and Caen Railway of and, in 1854, the Caen and Cherbourg Railway of . The Dutch were relatively slow to start building railways but in 1852 with Locke as engineer, Brassey built the Dutch Rhenish Railway of . Meanwhile, he continued to build lines in England, including the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway of , the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway of , the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway of and the North Devon Railway from Minehead to Barnstaple of .  The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada  Victoria Bridge under construction In 1852 Brassey took out the largest contract of his career, which was to build the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. This line passed from Quebec, along the valley of the Saint Lawrence River, and then to the north of Lake Ontario to Toronto. The line totalled in length. The consulting engineer for the project was Robert Stephenson and the company's engineer for the whole undertaking was Alexander Ross. Brassey worked in partnership with Peto, Betts and Sir William Jackson. The line crossed the river at Montreal by the Victoria Bridge. This was a tubular bridge designed by Robert Stephenson and was the longest bridge in the world at the time, measuring some . The bridge opened in 1859 and the formal opening ceremony was carried out the following year by the Prince of Wales.; The construction of the line caused considerable problems. The main problem was the raising of the necessary finance and at one stage Brassey travelled to Canada to appeal personally for assistance. Other difficulties arose from the severity of the Canadian winter, the waterways being frozen for around six months each year, and resistance from Canadian businessmen. The line was an engineering success but a financial failure, with the contractors losing ¬£1 million. =The Canada Works= The contract for the Grand Trunk Railway included all the materials required for building the bridge and the railway, including the rolling stock. To manufacture the metallic components, Brassey built a new factory in Birkenhead which he called The Canada Works. A suitable site was found by George Harrison, Brassey's brother-in-law, and the factory was built with a quay alongside to take ocean-going ships. The works was managed by George Harrison with a Mr. Alexander and William Heap as assistants. The machine shop was in length and included a blacksmiths' shop with 40 furnaces, anvils and steam hammers, a coppersmiths' shop, and fabrication, woodwork and pattern shops. There was also a well-stocked library and a reading room for all the workforce. The fitting shop was designed to manufacture 40 locomotives a year and a total of 300 were produced in the next eight years. The first locomotive, given its trial in May 1854, was named Lady Elgin, after the wife of the Governor General of Canada of the time, the Earl of Elgin. For the bridge hundreds of thousands of components were required and all were manufactured in Birkenhead or in other English factories to Brassey's specifications. These were all stamped and coded, loaded into ships to be taken to Quebec and then by rail to the site of the bridge for assembly. The central tube of the bridge contained over 10,000 pieces of iron, perforated by holes for half a million rivets, and when it was assembled every piece and hole was true.  The Grand Crimean Central Railway  Navvies working on the railway in 1854 Brassey played a part in helping the British forces to success in the Crimean War. The Black Sea port of Sevastopol was held by the Russians. The British government, in alliance with the French and the Turks, sent an army of 30,000 to Balaclava, another port in a neighbouring bay of the Black Sea, from which to attack Sevastopol. Sevastopol was besieged in September 1854 by the British and allied forces. It was hoped that the siege would be short but with the coming of winter the conditions were appalling and it was proving difficult to transport clothing, food, medical supplies and weaponry from Balaclava to the front. When news of the problem arrived in Britain, Brassey joined with Peto and Betts in offering to build a railway at cost to transport these necessary supplies. They shipped out the equipment and materials for building the railway, which had been intended for other undertakings, together with an army of navvies to carry out the work. Within seven weeks, in severe winter conditions, the railway from Balaclava to the troops besieging Sevastopol was completed. It then became possible to move supplies easily to the front and Sevastopol was finally taken in September 1855.  Worldwide expansion  Brassey Steam Engine on the Warsaw‚ÄìTerespol Railway, 1866 In addition to building more railways in Britain and in other European countries, Brassey undertook contracts in other continents. In South America his railways totalled , in Australia , and in India and Nepal . In 1866 there was a great economic slump, caused by the collapse of the bank of Overend, Gurney and Company, and many of Brassey's colleagues and competitors became insolvent. However, despite setbacks, Brassey survived the crisis and drove ahead with the projects he already had in hand. These included the Lemberg (now Lviv) and Czernowicz (now Chernivtsi) Railway in Galicia (part of Austrian Empire) which continued to be constructed despite the Austro-Prussian War which was taking place in the locality. From 1867 Brassey's health was beginning to decline, but he continued to negotiate further contracts, including the Czernowicz and Suczawa Railway in the Austrian Empire. In 1868 he suffered a mild stroke but he continued to work and in April 1869 he embarked on an extensive tour of over in Eastern Europe. By the time of his death he had built one mile in every twenty miles of railway in the world.  Non-railway contracts  Victoria Dock showing the hydraulic lift Brassey's works were not limited to railways and associated structures. In addition to his factories in Birkenhead, he built an engineering works in France to supply materials for his contracts there. He built a number of drainage systems, and a waterworks at Calcutta. Brassey built docks at Greenock, Birkenhead, Barrow- in-Furness and London. His London docks were the Victoria Docks which had a water area of over . The contract for this was agreed in 1852 in partnership with Peto and Betts and the docks were opened in 1857. Also included in the contract were warehouses and wine vaults totalling an area of about . The dockside machinery was worked by hydraulic power supplied by William Armstrong. The dock had links to Brassey's London, Tilbury and Southend Railway and thereby to the entire British rail system. In 1861 Brassey built part of the London sewerage system for Joseph Bazalgette. This was a stretch of the Metropolitan Mid Level Sewer of which started at Kensal Green, passed under Bayswater Road, Oxford Street and Clerkenwell to the River Lea. It was one of the earliest ventures to use steam cranes. The undertaking was considered to have been one of Brassey's most difficult. The sewer is still in operation today. He also worked with Bazalgette to build the Victoria Embankment on the north bank of the River Thames from Westminster Bridge to Blackfriars Bridge. Brassey gave financial help to Brunel to build his ship The Leviathan, which was later called The Great Eastern and which in 1854 was six times larger than any other vessel in the world. Brassey was a major shareholder in the ship and after Brunel's death, he, together with Gooch and Barber, bought the ship for the purpose of laying the first Transatlantic telegraph cable across the North Atlantic in 1864. Brassey had other ideas which were ahead of his time. He tried to interest the governments of the United Kingdom and Europe in the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel but this came to nothing. He also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Dari√©n (now the Isthmus of Panama) but this idea similarly had no success.  Working methods  Victoria Bridge and the names of the partners In most of Brassey's contracts he worked in partnership with other contractors, in particular with Peto and Betts. The planning of the details of the projects was done by the engineers. Sometimes there would be a consulting engineer and below him another engineer who was in charge of the day-to-day activities. During his career Brassey worked with many engineers, the most illustrious being Robert Stephenson, Joseph Locke and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The day-to- day work was overseen by agents, who managed and controlled the activities of the subcontractors. The actual work was done by labourers, in those days known as navvies, supervised by gangers (or foremen). In the early days the navvies were mainly English and many of them had formerly worked on building the canals. They were later joined by men from Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The number of Irish workers particularly increased following the potato famine. Brassey paid his navvies and gangers a wage and provided food, clothing, shelter and, in some projects, a lending library. On overseas contracts local labour would be used if it were available, but the work was often done or supplemented by British workers. The agent on the site had overall responsibility for a project. He had to be a man of great capability, working for a fee plus a percentage of the profits, with penalties for late finishing and inducements to complete the work early. Brassey had considerable skill in choosing good men to work in this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price he would make a suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents. Despite this he had neither an office nor office staff, dealing with all the correspondence himself. Much of the detail of his works were held in his memory. He travelled with a personal valet and later had a cashier. But all his letters were written by him; it is recorded that on one occasion after the rest of his party had gone to bed, 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight.; Although he won a large number of contracts, his bids were not always successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six others had been unsuccessful. Brassey was given a number of honours to celebrate his achievements, including the French L√©gion d'honneur, the Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and the Austrian Iron Crown (the first time this had been awarded to a foreigner). Marriage and children In 1831 he married Maria Harrison, the second daughter of Joseph Harrison, a forwarding and shipping agent with whom he had come into contact during his early days in Birkenhead. Maria gave Thomas considerable support and encouragement throughout his career. She encouraged him to bid for the contract for Dutton Viaduct and, when that was unsuccessful, to apply for the next available contract. Thomas' work led to frequent moves of home in their early years; from Birkenhead to Stafford, Kingston upon Thames, Winchester and then Fareham. On each occasion Maria supervised the packing of their possessions and the removal. The Harrison children had been taught to speak French, while Thomas himself was unable to do so. Therefore, when the opportunity arose to apply for the French contracts, Maria was willing to act as interpreter and encouraged Thomas to bid for them. This resulted in moves to Vernon in Normandy, then to Rouen, on to Paris and back again to Rouen. Thomas refused to learn French and Maria acted as interpreter for all his French undertakings. Maria organised the education of their three sons. In time the family established a more-or-less permanent base in Lowndes Square, Belgravia, London. They had three surviving sons, who all gained distinction in their own right: *Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey (1836-1918), eldest son, a Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Plymouth Devonport in Devon (1865) and for Hastings in Sussex (1868‚Äì86) who served as Governor of Victoria. He was elevated to the peerage in 1886 as Baron Brassey, \\"of Bulkeley in the County Palatine of Chester\\", and in 1911 was created Viscount Hythe, \\"of Hythe in the County of Kent\\" and Earl Brassey. His only son Thomas Brassey, 2nd Earl Brassey (1863-1919) died childless when all the titles became extinct. *Henry Arthur Brassey (1840-1891), DL, of Preston Hall, Aylesford, Kent and of Bath House, Piccadilly, London, a Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Sandwich in Kent. He was the father of Henry Brassey, 1st Baron Brassey of Apethorpe, a Conservative politician, who was elevated to the House of Lords in 1938. *Colonel Albert Brassey (1844-1918), a rower, soldier and Conservative Member of Parliament for Banbury 1895-1906. *a fourth son who died in infancy.  Later years  In 1870 Brassey was told that he had cancer but he continued to visit his working sites. One of his last visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, only a few miles from his first railway contract at Penkridge. In the late summer of 1870 he took to his bed at his home in St Leonards-on-Sea. There he was visited by members of his work force, not only his engineers and agents, but also his navvies, many of whom had walked for days to come and pay their respects. When Brassey's business friend, Edward Betts, became insolvent in 1867, Brassey bought Betts' estate at Preston Hall, Aylesford in Kent on behalf of his second son, Henry.Preston Hall History, Weston Homes PLC, 25 January 2015. Retrieved 5 December 2017. In 1870 Brassey purchased Heythrop Park, a baroque house situated in an estate of northeast of Oxford as a wedding present for his third son, Albert.; On 8 December 1870 Thomas Brassey died from a brain haemorrhage in Victoria Hotel, St Leonards and was buried in the churchyard of St Laurence's Church, Catsfield, Sussex where a memorial stone has been erected. His estate was valued at ¬£5,200,000 which consisted of \\"under ¬£3,200,000 in UK\\" and \\"over ¬£2,000,000\\" in a trust fund. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes him as \\"one of the wealthiest of the self-made Victorians\\".  Thomas Brassey, the man  It is not easy to be objective about the nature of Thomas Brassey's character because the earliest biography by Helps was commissioned by the Brassey family and the latest, rather short, biography was written by his great-great- grandson, Tom Stacey. There is virtually no remaining material of value to a biographer available today. There is no private correspondence, there are no diaries and none of his personal reminiscences. Judging by his achievements alone, he must have been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them. Walker, in his 1969 biography, tried to make an accurate assessment of Brassey using Helps and other sources. He found it difficult to discover anyone who had a bad word to say about him, either during his life or since. Brassey expected a high standard of work from his employees; Cooke states that his \\"standards of quality were fastidious in the extreme\\". There can be no doubt about some of his qualities. He was exceptionally hardworking, and had an excellent memory and ability to perform mental arithmetic. He was a good judge of men, which enabled him to select the best people to be his agents. He was scrupulously fair with his subcontractors and kind to his navvies, supporting them financially at their times of need. He would at times undertake contracts of little benefit to himself to provide work for his navvies. The only faults which his eldest son could identify were a tendency to praise traits and actions of other people he would condemn in his own family, and an inability to refuse a request. No criticism of him could be found from the engineers with whom he worked, his business associates, his agents or his navvies. He paid his men fairly and generously. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states \\"His greatest achievement was to raise the status of the civil engineering contractor to the eminence already attained in the mid-nineteenth century by the engineer\\".Brooke, David 'Brassey, Thomas (1805‚Äì1870)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, October 2006 , accessed 29 January 2007. Walker regards him as \\"one of the giants of the nineteenth century\\".  Commemorations  Bust of Thomas Brassey, Chester Cathedral Brassey Tribute Stones, Bulkeley None of his three sons became involved in their father's work and the business was wound up by administrators. The sons created a memorial to their parents in St Erasmus' Chapel in Chester cathedral. This consists of a backcloth to the altar inscribed to their parents' memory, and a bust of their father to the north of the altar.Haynes, p. 64. The memorial is by Sir Arthur Blomfield and the bust by M. Wagmiller. There is also a bust of Thomas in Chester's Grosvenor Museum and plaques to his memory in Chester station. Streets named after him in Chester are Brassey Street and Thomas Brassey Close (which is off Lightfoot Street). In November 2005, Penkridge celebrated the bicentenary of Brassey's birth and a special commemorative train was run from Chester to Holyhead. In January 2007, children from Overchurch Junior School in Upton, Wirral celebrated the life of Brassey. In April 2007 a plaque was placed on Brassey's first bridge at Saughall Massie. In the village of Bulkeley, near Malpas, Cheshire, is a tree called the 'Brassey Oak' on land once owned by the Brassey family. This was planted to celebrate Thomas' 40th birthday in 1845. It was surrounded by four inscribed sandstone pillars tied together by iron rails but due to the growth of the tree these burst and the stones fell. They were recovered and in 2007 were replaced in a more accessible place with an information board. In 2019 a blue plaque was installed by Conservation Areas Wirral on the remaining structure of his Canada Works building in Beaufort Road, now part of the Wirral Waters area in Birkenhead.

Most of the western portion of SR 90 is the Marina Freeway, a short freeway in southwestern Los Angeles and the nearby suburbs, linking Marina del Rey to the rest of Greater Los Angeles. SR 90 begins at Lincoln Boulevard (State Route 1) near Marina del Rey as the Marina Expressway. It then goes past a few intersections before becoming the Marina Freeway. It then continues eastward approximately along the border between the Del Rey and Westchester neighborhoods of the city of Los Angeles before terminating in Slauson Avenue in southern Culver City to just past Culver Boulevard. The eastern portion of SR 90 runs along Imperial Highway between Beach Boulevard (State Route 39) in La Habra and State Route 91 in Anaheim Hills, also passing through Brea and Yorba Linda. A stretch in Yorba Linda between Yorba Linda Boulevard and Orangethorpe Avenue was relinquished to the city in 2002 and built to freeway standards. The city renamed it the Richard M. Nixon Freeway in honor of the 37th President of the United States, Richard Nixon, who was born in Yorba Linda less than half a mile away from the road. Route description The west segment of SR 90 begins at Lincoln Boulevard (State Route 1) in the Del Rey district of Los Angeles. It heads east along the Marina Expressway, past several intersections, and becomes the Marina Freeway after crossing Ballona Creek. After two interchanges - with Centinela Avenue and Interstate 405 - SR 90 and the freeway end at Slauson Avenue. The east segment begins at the intersection of Imperial Highway and Beach Boulevard (State Route 39) in La Habra. It heads east and southeast on Imperial Highway, ending at State Route 91 about after crossing the Santa Ana River from Yorba Linda into Anaheim. A portion of the road in Yorba Linda is built to freeway standards; it is now known as the Richard M. Nixon Parkway after the city accepted maintenance in 2002. However, the same state law that authorized relinquishment required the city to \\"maintain signs directing motorists to the continuation of Route 90\\". SR 90 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History Legislative Route 221 (the Slauson Freeway, now the Marina Freeway) was defined in 1947 to run from pre-1964 Legislative Route 60 (now State Route 1) east to pre-1964 Legislative Route 165 (now Interstate 110). A 1959 extension took it east to pre-1964 Legislative Route 170 (now Interstate 605).California Highways: Pre-1964 Legislative Route 221 To the east, Legislative Route 176 (the Yorba Linda Freeway, now also the Marina Freeway) was defined in 1939 from pre-1964 Legislative Route 62 (now State Route 39) east and southeast to pre-1964 Legislative Route 43 (now State Route 91). A 1959 extension took it west to pre-1964 Legislative Route 174 (later State Route 42) near Norwalk.California Highways: Pre-1964 Legislative Route 176 A sign at Esperanza Rd. / Orangethorpe Ave. In the 1964 renumbering, LR 221 was assigned State Route 90, but LR 176 all became part of State Route 42, along with the connecting LR 174 to the west. The piece of LR 176 between I-605 and SR 39 was reassigned to SR 90 in 1965, and the rest east to SR 91 became part of SR 90 in 1968 (at the same time as SR 42 became Interstate 105). Originally planned as the Slauson Freeway, Route 90 was slated to extend across southern Los Angeles County and northern Orange County, ending at the Riverside Freeway in eastern Anaheim. However, by the 1960s, community opposition had reduced it to what is effectively a minor spur of I-405 to Marina Del Rey (derisively dubbed the \\"Slauson Cutoff\\" by comedian Johnny Carson). It was renamed the Richard M. Nixon Freeway for a brief period in the early 1970s, but after Nixon's resignation in the wake of the Watergate scandal, its name was changed to the current appellation. From I-405 west to Centinela Avenue, the Marina Freeway is 8 lanes wide, before it quickly narrows to 4 lanes at the Culver Boulevard exit. The freeway ends approximately west of Culver Boulevard, and continues as an expressway. There has been talk of extending the Marina Expressway slightly west of Lincoln Boulevard (Route 1) to Admiralty Way (approximately ) to accommodate ongoing expansion of the Marina Del Rey area. Strong opposition to this makes actualization of this plan uncertain. There were once plans to connect the two sections via the Slauson Freeway and Yorba Linda Freeway, mostly parallel to Slauson Avenue, but this was never built. The full route was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959. In 2002 the City of Yorba Linda assumed responsibility for Imperial Highway to complete various construction projects within city limits when the State Assembly passed AB 887; it lost its state route designation in the process and is now called the Richard M. Nixon Parkway within the city. By 2005, construction on the western end of the Marina Freeway began, to extend the freeway terminus from Culver Boulevard to approximately west of Culver Boulevard by building a full interchange at Culver. The freeway extension was completed in early 2007. The freeway extension also allows Route 90 drivers to avoid a traffic signal at Alla Road (just west of Culver Boulevard.). After the end of the freeway, a pair of frontage roads operating as an expressway continues as Route 90 up to Route 1 (Lincoln Boulevard). Signalized intersections occur at Mindanao Way and Lincoln Boulevard, which is the end of the expressway in Marina del Rey. The reason for the extension is to relieve traffic congestion on surface streets.

Built in 1985 as the Market Post Tower, it was designed to provide a mix of office and retail space. When first built, the building was controversial due to its gold- colored glass exterior, which produced high light and heat reflection. In its early years, the owners struggled financially with the property and were forced to put it up for sale in 1987. While the intended tenants did not materialize, the building proved popular with telecom carriers as an Internet exchange center, with MAE-West on the 13th floor, one of the oldest and most well known Internet exchanges. Many carriers maintain collocation space in the building to support their interconnections through MAE-West (so-called \\"public peering\\") as well as direct interconnections (\\"private peering\\"). Tower 55 remains mixed-use, comprising office, telecom, and retail space, but it is perhaps most well known for its use by internet network service, peering, and colocation providers. The building was purchased in 2000 by The Carlyle Group, which further enhanced the building's network infrastructure, and now advertises it as a \\"multi-tenant carrier neutral telecom facility.\\" CoreSite, a Denver-based wholesale provider of data centers, colocation and peering, currently handles tenant leases within the building. San Jose's first public nude sculpture was located at the Market Post Building, but this was removed during building renovations in 2012.

He saw Christ as a divine teacher, but held reason to be sovereign over religion. He questioned the morality of religions, while defending Christianity on rational grounds. Despite little schooling, Chubb was well up on the religious controversies. His The True Gospel of Jesus Christ, Asserted sets out to distinguish the teaching of Jesus from that of the Evangelists. Chubb's views on free will and determinism, expressed in A Collection of Tracts on Various Subjects (1730), were extensively criticised by Jonathan Edwards in Freedom of the Will (1754).See Thuesen, ed., The Works of Jonathan Edwards, Vol. 26, p. 324. Works One of Chubb's published tracts, The Previous Question with Regard to Religion, went through four editions, three in 1725. His tracts were collected in a quarto volume in 1730 and attracted wide notice. (A second, two-volume edition in 1754 included 35 tracts.) Chubb was encouraged to write further tracts. A disciple of Samuel Clarke, he gradually moved from Arianism into a modified Deism. In 1731 he published a Discourse concerning Reason... [showing that] reason is, or else that it ought to be, a sufficient guide in matters of Religion. Some \\"reflections\\" upon \\"moral and positive duty\\" were added, as suggested by Clarke's Exposition of the Catechism. In 1732 The Sufficiency of Reason further considered... was appended to an \\"enquiry\\" against a recent sermon by Samuel Croxall arguing that to celebrate Charles I's martyrdom was inconsistent with celebrating William III's arrival. In 1734 came four tracts of his attacking the common theory of inspiration, arguing that the resurrection of Christ was no proof of his divine mission and criticising the story of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac. The whole argument showed increasing scepticism, and the assertion about Abraham led to some controversy. He returned to the question in 1735, in some \\"Observations\\" on Thomas Rundle's nomination to the Diocese of Gloucester, Rundle having been accused of disbelieving the story. Three tracts were added that continued the former discussion. In 1738 Chubb published The True Gospel of Jesus Christ asserted, which provoked various attacks, including one from Ebenezer Hewlett. It was followed by The True Gospel of Jesus vindicated, and An Enquiry into the Ground and Foundation of Religion, wherein it is shown that Religion is founded on Nature. He persisted in stating that true Christianity consisted of a belief that morality alone could make men acceptable to God, that repentance for sin would secure God's mercy, and that there would be future retribution. His Enquiry into the Ground and Foundation of Religion (1740) includes a controversy with Henry Stebbing. Chubb argues against interpreting literally the command to give all to the poor, noting that Stebbing himself was a pluralist with two livings, a preachership and an archdeaconry, and due to be chancellor of the Diocese of Salisbury, so that he could hardly interpret the command literally to himself. Chubb's 1741 Discourse on Miracles states that they could at most afford a \\"probable proof\\" of a revelation. In 1743 his Enquiry concerning Redemption is a defence of himself against some sneers by William Warburton. \\"The Ground and Foundation of Morality considered\\" (1745) is an attack on Thomas Rutherforth's theory of self-love. The last work that Chubb published himself was Four Dissertations (1746), attacking some Old Testament passages with a freedom that gave wide offence. Views on prayer Joseph Waligore states in a 2012 article, \\"The Piety of the English Deists\\", that Chubb discussed prayer more than any other deist. Chubb's longest writing on the subject was a 30-page pamphlet, \\"An Enquiry Concerning Prayer\\", where he began by insisting that prayer was a duty God required for achieving a closer relationship with him. The purpose of prayer was to render someone > \\"a suitable and proper object of God's special care and love. For as prayer > is an address or application of a dependent being to his supreme governour, > and original benefactor.... It naturally draws forth our souls in filial > fear, in hope and trust, in love, delight, and joy in God; and creates in us > a just concern to please him, and to approve ourselves in his sight; and > consequently to put on that purity and piety, humility and charity which is > the spirit and practice of true Christianity.\\"Thomas Chubb, \\"An Enquiry > Concerning Prayer\\", in A Collection of Tracts on Various Subjects, 2nd ed., > 2 vols. (London: 1754), 1:277-289, as cited in Waligore, p. 191. Chubb said we should pray often and > \\"it is when we forget God, when God is not in all our thoughts, that we do > amiss; then our minds and lives are corrupted and defiled.\\" He also discussed whom we should pray to. First he said we should not pray to dead human souls, as we have no reason to think they hear our prayers or have any power to help us. Then he discussed whether we should pray to angels. Unlike Morgan ‚Äì who thought we should pray to both God and angels ‚Äì Chubb thought we probably should not pray to angels. He said even though they were \\"ministering spirits\\", we could not be sure they heard our prayers, and they might not be at liberty to help us without God's direct guidance. He spent a final ten pages wondering whether we should pray to Jesus or just to God the Father, concluding we should pray to God the Father \\"in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ\\". Chubb was sure that God heard all our petitions, but he did not think God answered them all in the way we wished. God answered only if they were for lawful things and people prayed earnestly \\"with a modest resignation to God's will\\".[vi] Chubb thought that God sometimes gave us harmful things we had prayed for, but then God acted \\"in displeasure\\". In another tract, he was more pessimistic about God's positive response rate to our prayers. He cited evidence that God did not often answer our prayers: over the previous 200 years, millions of sincere, fervent prayers had petitioned God for the defeat of the Antichrist, but the Roman Catholic hierarchy or other interests ostensibly bent on defeating God's kingdom still existed.Thomas Chubb, The True Gospel of Jesus Christ Vindicated (London, 1739), pp. 68‚Äì70, as cited in Waligore, p. 191.

Of all the ancient world religions, only Judaism survives and flourishes, at least, as much as it can. In Bethlehem, PA, a child named Jesus, but referred to as HERO, is born and forced to flee with his family to the small Jewish section of Brooklyn. Jesus grows up and begins to preach and teach the principles of Christianity to the people of New York City, teaching people to love their enemies and care for each other. I.C.O.N. realizes HERO is a threat, and the Chief of police Devlin (a derivative of the Devil or Satan), with the help of chief Rabbi Kai (Caiaphas), conspire to end HERO's revolutionary teachings. The Opera is narrated by \\"Agent Hunter\\", a former I.C.O.N. agent who met HERO and was soon thrown into prison for joining him against I.C.O.N. The opera also features Petrov (Peter), Maggie (Mary Magdalene), and Jude (Judas Iscariot) the latter who conspires with Kai and Devlin to betray HERO. The storyline progresses through several stories about Jesus' miracles and sermons, using references from the Bible's four gospels, continues through Jesus' execution, at the hands of I.C.O.N's angry mob, and eventually ending with his resurrection.

His column is nationally syndicated by Creators Syndicate. He is also a frequent contributor during Fox News Channel's election coverage. His political views are generally conservative. Barone has said he is not religious, although he is sympathetic to and respectful of social conservatives. His commentary has been concerned with the topic of immigration. Perhaps partly as a result of being a descendant of Italian immigrants, Barone takes an optimistic view of contemporary immigration into the US. He says that Hispanic immigration has parallels to the Italian experience and that, given the right circumstances, current and future Hispanic and other immigrants can become Americanized and assimilated, just as the Italians were. * Columnist, Townhall.com, 2001‚Äìpresent * Senior political analyst, Washington Examiner, 2009‚Äìpresent * Senior writer, U.S. News & World Report, Washington, 1989‚Äì1996, 1998‚Äìdeparture * Senior staff editor, Reader's Digest, Washington, 1996‚Äì1998 * editorial writer and columnist, The Washington Post, 1981‚Äì1988 * Vice president, Peter D.

He was a pitcher in Major League Baseball for seventeen years and racked up 164 wins. All but one of those wins came with the Chicago White Sox. A knuckleball specialist, he threw left-handed and batted right-handed, stood tall and was listed at . He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Career overview In 1960, Wood was signed out of Belmont High School by the Boston Red Sox. He pitched on-and-off for them for a few seasons before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in late September 1964. After two seasons with Pittsburgh, he was traded to the White Sox after the 1966 season.Pirates peddle Wood to Sox When he arrived, knuckleball specialist Hoyt Wilhelm advised him to use his knuckleball exclusively. Taking Wilhelm's advice, Wood's career took off, first as a relief pitcher, and then as a starting pitcher. With the White Sox, Wood became well known as a durable workhorse, and one of the last pitchers to consistently throw well over 300 innings in a season. As a relief pitcher in 1968, Wood set the major league record (since broken) of 88 games pitched in a season. He converted to a starting pitcher in 1971, and continued to display unusual durability. During the years 1971-74, Wood averaged 45 games started and 347 innings pitched, winning a total of 90 games, while losing 69. He led the American League in games started in each year from 1972 through 1975, and he was the league leader in both wins and innings pitched in 1972 and 1973. Wood finished second in the voting for the American League Cy Young Award, losing a close vote to Gaylord Perry. Wood's resilience, which was attributed to the less stressful nature of the knuckleball delivery, led to some unusual feats of endurance. On May 28, 1973, while pitching for the White Sox against the Cleveland Indians, Wood pitched the remainder of a 21-inning carryover game that had been suspended two nights earlier, allowing only two hits in five innings to earn the victory. He then started the regularly scheduled game and pitched a four- hit complete game shutout, earning two wins in the same night. Later that season, on July 20, Wood started both ends of a doubleheader, making him the last pitcher to do so.Great Baseball Feats, Facts and Figures, 2008 Edition, p. 136, David Nemec and Scott Flatow, A Signet Book, Penguin Group, New York, He lost both of those games. The knuckleball is also difficult to control, and in 1977, Wood tied a record by hitting three consecutive batters in the first inning. Wood's 1976 campaign was cut short on May 9 when a line-drive single hit by Ron LeFlore fractured his left kneecap in the sixth inning of a 4-2 White Sox victory over the Detroit Tigers at Tiger Stadium.Rogers, Thomas. \\"Wilbur Wood Out for Year With Broken Knee,\\" The New York Times, Monday, May 10, 1976. Retrieved July 27, 2018 He had surgery the next day, but the outlook was bleak. Many predicted that he would never pitch again, but after considerable rehabilitation, he did some pitching for two more seasons with the White Sox. However, he showed few signs of his former mastery. He retired in 1978, moving back to his native New England. Career statistics In a seventeen-year major league career, Wood compiled a 164-156 record with a 3.24 ERA in 661 games played. He had 1,411 strikeouts in 2,684 innings pitched. He compiled 24 shutouts and 114 complete games in 297 games started. He was also the last pitcher in American League history to win and lose 20 or more games in the same season (24-20 in 1973). Wood was a below average hitting pitcher. He posted a .084 batting average (27-for-322) with only two extra-base hits (both doubles) and just 13 RBI. He was better than average defensively, recording a .977 fielding percentage which was 26 points higher than the league average at his position.

Jacob Hacker describes him as the \\"dean of welfare state scholars.\\" Over the past decade his research has moved towards family demographic issues. A synthesis of his work was published as Families in the 21st Century (Stockholm, SNS, 2016). Esping-Andersen is professor emeritus at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona (Spain), and member of the Scientific Committee of the Juan March Institute and of the Board of Trustees and the Scientific Council at the IMDEA Social Sciences Institute, both in Madrid (Spain). He is a member of the American Academy of Social Sciences and the British Academy. He was awarded an honoris doctor causa from the University of Copenhagen in 2012. He is now a research professor at Bocconi University in Milan. Major works His major, most influential and highly cited book titled The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism was published in 1990 and it laid out three main types of welfare states, in which modern developed capitalist nations cluster: *Liberal *Corporatist-Statist *Social Democratic It is important to note that these categories have little to do with the contemporary labels of American politics, and rather have much more to do with general political theory. The traditional examples of the three types of welfare states are the United States (liberal), Germany (corporatist-statist) and Sweden (social democratic). Other sociologists and political scientists went on to apply his theoretical analysis to the real world. One such example is a book entitled Real Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, written by Robert E. Goodin, Bruce Headey, Ruud Muffels, and Henk-Jan Dirven. While some critics claim Esping-Andersen's categories are becoming outdated, many political scientists are attracted by its intuitive simplicity. In the past decade, his research has moved to demographic issues and in particular to the consequences of women's changing roles. He has, most notably, developed a multiple equilibrium framework for the understanding of changing family behaviour. See in particular his 'Families in the 21st Century and Esping-Andersen and Billari (2015) 'Retheorizing family demographic change'. Population and Development Review (2015)''' Criticism The evolving nature of welfare states often makes it difficult to categorize. Arguably, many welfare states have components from some or all typologies, making them more akin to points on a continuum rather than rigid typologies, a fact Esping-Andersen acknowledges in his writings. According to French sociologist, Georges Menahem, Esping-Andersen's \\"decommodification index\\" aggregates both qualitative and quantitative variables for ‚Äùsets of dimensions‚Äù which fluid, and pertain to three very different areas. Similarly, Menahem has concerns regarding the validity of the index, and its potential for replication. In 1996, the Italian Social Scientist Maurizio Ferrera, further developed Esping-Andersen's Worlds of Welfare by identifying a fourth subtype of the welfare state model, the Southern European Model of Welfare. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/095892879600600102  Bibliography  = Books =     Esping-Andersen, Gosta Families in the 21st Century (Stockholm, 2016).

An earlier study, the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission, was conducted by the colonial authorities in British India in 1893‚Äì94. The reports systematically contradicted claims made by the U.S. Treasury Department that smoking marijuana results in insanity, deteriorates physical and mental health, assists in criminal behavior and juvenile delinquency, is physically addictive, and is a \\"gateway\\" drug to more dangerous drugs. The report was prepared by the New York Academy of Medicine, on behalf of a commission appointed in 1939 by New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act. Released in 1944, the report infuriated Harry Anslinger, who was campaigning against marijuana. Anslinger condemned it as unscientific.HARRY J. ANSLINGER: The Murderers THE STORY OF THE NARCOTIC GANGS, 1962 Anslinger went on an offensive against what he saw as a \\"degenerate Hollywood\\" that was promoting marijuana use. After high-profile arrests of actors like Robert Mitchum, Hollywood gave Anslinger full control over the script of any film that mentioned marijuana. Sociological conclusions After more than five years of research the members of the committee drew up a catalog of 13 salient points with the conclusions they reached.The LaGuardia Report ‚Äì Conclusions # Marihuana is used extensively in the Borough of Manhattan but the problem is not as acute as it is reported to be in other sections of the United States. # The introduction of marihuana into this area is recent as compared to other localities. # The cost of marihuana is low and therefore within the purchasing power of most persons. # The distribution and use of marihuana is centered in Harlem. # The majority of marihuana smokers are Blacks and Latin-Americans. # The consensus among marihuana smokers is that the use of the drug creates a definite feeling of adequacy. # The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to addiction in the medical sense of the word. # The sale and distribution of marihuana is not under the control of any single organized group. # The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine or heroin or cocaine addiction and no effort is made to create a market for these narcotics by stimulating the practice of marihuana smoking. # Marihuana is not the determining factor in the commission of major crimes. # Marihuana smoking is not widespread among school children. # Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice of smoking marihuana. # The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded. Therefore, according to the LaGuardia Report, the gateway drug theory is without foundation (points 7 and 9). Consequences Published in 1944, the report offended Harry Anslinger, who branded it as \\"unscientific\\". Harry Anslinger denounced Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, the New York Academy of Medicine and the doctors who had worked for more than five years on the research. Anslinger said that they should not conduct more experiments or studies on marijuana without his personal permission. Anslinger interrupted, between 1944 and 1945, each current research on derivatives of cannabis, and according to some personally commissioned the American Medical Association to prepare a position which would reflect the one of the government.Jack Herer. 1985. The Emperor Wears No Clothes. Ah Ha Publishing, Van Nuys, CA. The study conducted by AMA between 1944 and 1945 on Anslinger's personal request, having as objective to disprove the statements of the LaGuardia Report, leveraged again on racism, asserting that \\"of the experimental group, thirty-four men were black, and only one was white\\", and \\"those who smoked marijuana, became disrespectful of white soldiers and officers during military segregation\\".\\"Army Study of Marijuana\\", Newsweek, January 15, 1945 Only in 1972, the same institutional source that spread the series of scientifically unfounded rumors about the dangers of cannabis admitted that \\"these stories were largely false\\" and that \\"with careful consideration of the documentation there is no confirmation of the existence of a causal relationship between marijuana use and the possible use of heroin\\".National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, \\"Marihuana.

The term \\"sweater girl\\" was made popular in the 1940s and 1950s to describe Hollywood actresses like Lana Turner, Jayne Mansfield, and Jane Russell, who adopted the popular fashion of wearing tight, form-fitting sweaters that emphasized the woman's bustline. The sweater girl trend was not confined to Hollywood and was viewed with alarm by some. In 1949 a Pittsburgh police superintendent even singled out the sweater girl as a symptom of the moral decline of postwar youth:  Fashion influence  Patti Page, 1955. New, soft fabrics like cashmere and angora were being used to make sweaters. The conical shape bra, sometimes called a bullet bra, raises and separates her breasts. In its original form, the look was often tied to the promotion of new bra technology. Interest in the bullet bra revived after Madonna wore a cone bra during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour.Madonna on the Blond Ambition World Tour The bra was designed by Jean Paul Gaultier who was inspired by the vintage Perma-Lift bullet bra of the 1940s. By that time, the style was regarded as erotic and provocative. The bullet bra has also become popular with burlesque and rockabilly enthusiasts, both of which draw inspiration from the 1950s.  Popular culture  Lana Turner's appearance in the 1937 film They Won't Forget in a tight-fitting knit top is sometimes considered the first case of the \\"sweater girl\\", as Hollywood publicists sought for a catchy phrase to describe the impact she made on the screen.

It was put together several months after the release of the band's 1969 eponymous debut, during which they continued to tour heavily and recorded Time and a Word during gaps between shows. Yes continued to follow their early musical direction of performing original material and cover versions of songs by pop, jazz, and folk artists. A small orchestra of brass and string session musicians was used on most of the album's songs. Guitarist Peter Banks did not support the idea of adding an orchestra to the album, resulting in increased tensions between himself and the rest of the group. During their UK tour in April 1970 and before the album's release, Banks was fired from Yes and was replaced by Steve Howe. The UK album cover was considered inappropriate for the American market, so a new photograph of the band was used, putting Howe on the cover of an album on which he did not perform. Time and a Word received mixed reviews from critics, but became the band's first release to enter the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 45; however, it did not chart in the United States. In 2003, the album was remastered with several previously unreleased tracks.  Background and recording  After the release of their debut album Yes in July 1969 for Atlantic Records, Yes resumed extensive touring across the UK. The line-up of the group at this time included lead vocalist Jon Anderson, guitarist Peter Banks, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Bill Bruford, and organist Tony Kaye. Towards the end of 1969, they booked time at Advision Studios in London during gaps between shows to record Time and a Word. In a November 1969 interview during a tour of Switzerland, Bruford talked about the album, saying Anderson was \\"pouring out new numbers for us to play ... Usually he writes a tune and we listen to the tape and take it from there\\". At Advision, Yes were joined by producer Tony Colton, a friend of Anderson's who was also the singer of the rock band Heads Hands & Feet. Phil Carson, the European managing director of Atlantic and a fan of the band, brought in audio engineer Eddy Offord to assist Colton in the album's production because of his skills and hard work. Offord would become a key figure in the band's history in the 1970s as their producer and live sound mixer. The group continued to follow their early musical direction of performing original material and rearranged cover versions of songs by pop, jazz, and folk artists. They followed the same format as Yes; an album of eight tracks with two covers. A discussion amongst Squire, Anderson, and Colton during the writing process led the decision of incorporating orchestral arrangements into some of their new songs. Anderson wished to use an orchestra as their new ideas needed \\"some additional ... sounds\\". He observed that Banks and Kaye had not worked together to create a strong sound that their new arrangements required. To attempt to solve this, the group discussed using a Mellotron and tested one out, but the idea fell through. Instead, a brass section of session players and a string section formed of students from the Royal College of Music were hired to perform arrangements written and conducted by Tony Cox. Time and a Word was met with \\"Yes-style controversy\\", as described by band biographer and reporter Chris Welch. Banks became the most outspoken member over his issues surrounding the album which began the strain on his relationship with the rest of the group. He did not support the idea of an orchestra and thought it merely followed what rock bands Deep Purple and the Nice had already done. He argued it merely played parts originally written for the guitar or organ, leaving his active participation to the album a minimum or his guitar buried into the album's mix. Banks also disagreed with the decision to have Colton produce the album and claimed that Colton lacked the experience and personally disliked Banks and his playing. Colton's ability was also questioned by Squire, who recalled one incident during the mixing of \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\\", by which time Banks's replacement Steve Howe had joined and attended; Colton mixed the song using \\"a crappy pair of cans that did not reproduce bass\\", rather than using the studio's monitoring equipment. Colton asked for more bass, but Squire and Howe noticed the bass levels on the monitors were already high. In 1995, Offord said that he too thought Colton had not been the right person to produce the band at that time. The album's six original tracks are credited to Anderson with either Squire or David Foster, Anderson's former bandmate in The Warriors. Banks said he made contributions to the writing of the album, but his name was not included in the credits. It did not bother him at first, but it caused some discontent years later when he missed out on royalties. Time and a Word marked a development in Anderson's lyric content, who began to move from simple love themes to topics of greater scale, described by band biographer Dan Hedges as \\"life, oneness and the future\\".  Songs  \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\\", the album's first cover song, was written by American artist Richie Havens. It opens with an orchestral theme taken from the soundtrack to the 1958 Western film The Big Country by Jerome Moross. Anderson wrote \\"The Prophet\\" telling the story of a man, followed by many, who tells others to find and believe in themselves and not follow \\"like sheep\\". The song borrows a theme from \\"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\\" from The Planets suite by English composer Gustav Holst and shows Anderson incorporating other themes from classical music, to which he listened regularly. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was particularly well-received by future Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin, who requested the band perform the song in concert during the 90125 tour in 1984. The song \\"Time and a Word\\" saw the band searching for an anthem-type song. Anderson, who was still musically naive, presented its basic theme to the group on a guitar, using only two or three chords, leaving the other band members trying to discern what he was playing. The song was recorded with Foster on acoustic guitar. Again Banks didn't agree and claimed it was not meant to be part of the final mix, having been intended only as a guide track. On the final version, Banks played his parts over Foster's. Yes also recorded \\"Dear Father\\" at Advision Studios, but decided not to include the track on the album. Cover The sleeve for the album's original UK pressing was designed and photographed by Laurence Sackman and co- ordinated by Graphreaks. The front cover features an artistic black-and-white Dada-esque chequered design featuring a nude woman, while the back cover included photographs of each member in front of a wind machine, distorting their faces. The front cover art was deemed inappropriate by the American record distributors, so Atlantic Records arranged for photographer Barrie Wentzell of Wardour Street, London to take a new photo of the band for use on the US printing. By the time the photograph was taken, Steve Howe had replaced Peter Banks as Yes' guitarist, so Howe appears on the American version of the album cover. However, the back of the US record sleeve is identical to the UK version, so it includes a picture of Banks. Howe has said that the original album cover was rejected because it was sexist, but that he was angry at Atlantic Records for continually printing and selling an album with his photo on the cover even though he did not play on the record. Release and reception Yes premiered most of Time and a Word during their two solo concerts at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 21 and 22 March 1970. For the second half, they played songs from the album with a twenty-piece orchestra led by Tony Cox. Anderson later considered the shows a failure, due to a lack of rehearsal time and a poor sound system. To record the orchestra, microphones were left dangling above the players using coat hangers. Banks thought the experiment was a \\"daft idea\\". Nevertheless, Chris Welch wrote a positive review in Melody Maker noting that despite the amplification problems, the \\"musical break-through\\" reaction from the audience suggested to him that the group had \\"arrived\\". The shows were the last in which Yes performed with an orchestra, until the 2001 Symphonic Tour to support their nineteenth studio album Magnification, which also featured orchestral arrangements. Tensions within the band increased, and just after the album's recording was completed in early 1970, Banks was asked to leave. Steve Howe would join the line-up, as a replacement, that June. Following the UK release of Time and a Word in July 1970, the album became the group's first to enter the UK Albums Chart, with a peak at number 45. Its US release followed in November 1970. Two singles were released: \\"Time and a Word\\" in March 1970 and \\"Sweet Dreams\\" in June 1970. The album sold no more copies than did the debut album Yes, which led management at Atlantic to consider dropping the band from the label. Carson managed to convince them to withdraw the notice, by which time the band had recruited Howe and secured Brian Lane as their new manager. The album received a mixed reception. It received an enthusiastic review by Roy Carr in New Musical Express in August 1970, which hailed it as one of the best releases of the year. To the reviewer, its material was \\"mentally exhilirating\\", and \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\\" set the standard and mood of the remaining seven tracks. Cox's arrangements were praised, which blended well with the group's ability \\"to perform intricate and highly complex ensemble passages with meticulous dexterity and precision\\". The review credited the band's instrumental strength from Squire's \\"identifiable\\" bass playing, which created a \\"formidable\\" rhythm section when paired with Bruford's \\"expertise\\" drumming.

The Convention sets out the obligations of Parties‚Äîthat is States that have agreed to be bound by the Convention‚Äîto carry out an environmental impact assessment of certain activities at an early stage of planning. It also lays down the general obligation of States to notify and consult each other on all major projects under consideration that are likely to have a significant adverse environmental impact across boundaries. As of April 2014, the treaty had been ratified by 44 states and the European Union.  Amendments  The Convention has been amended twice. The first amendment was adopted in Sofia in 2001; it has entered into force 26 August 2014. It opens the Convention to accession upon approval by United Nations Member States that are not members of the UNECE. The second amendment was adopted in Cavtat, Croatia, in 2004; as for the September 2016, it is not in force yet. Once in force it will: allow, as appropriate, affected Parties to participate in scoping; require reviews of compliance; revise the Convention's Appendix I (list of activities); and make other minor changes.  Procedure  The Convention involves a Party (or Parties) of origin (States where an activity is planned) and an affected Party (or Parties) (States whose territory may be significantly adversely affected by the activity). The Convention's main procedural steps are: * application of the Convention by the Party of origin (Art. 2.2, 2.5/App. I+III) * notification of the affected Party by the Party of origin (Art. 3.1) * confirmation of participation by the affected Party (Art. 3.3) * transmittal of information from the affected Party to the Party of origin (Art. 3.6) * public participation in tha affected Party (Art. 3.8) * preparation of EIA documentation (Art. 4/App. II) * distribution of the EIA documentation for the purpose of participation of authorities and public of the affected Party (Art. 4.2) * consultation between the concerned Parties (Art. 5) * final decision by the Party of origin (Art. 6.1) * transmittal of final decision documentation to the affected Party (Art. 6.2) * post-project analysis (Art. 7.1/App. V)  Inquiry commissions  Article 3(7) of the Convention offers a procedure by which parties can solve differences by scientific, non-judicial means. The first case in which an inquiry commission was established under article 3(7) was that of the Bystroe Canal, at the request of Romania in 2004. A case which involved countries far apart on the globe was raised by Micronesia, which claimed that the Czech coal-fired plant at Prunerov was significantly affecting its climate due to global warming.  Related issues  The Convention was also instrumental in the creation of Strategic Environmental Assessment and has been supplemented by a Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment.

Inishbofin has around 180 inhabitants and is a popular tourist destination. Name The island's English name Inishbofin is derived from the Irish name Inis B√≥ Finne ('Island of the White Cow'). There are several legends concerning the origins of the island's name. According to one legend, the island was actually a floating place until some fishermen landed on it in a fog. By bringing fire onto the island, they dispelled the magic, fixing it in place. They then saw an old woman driving a white cow, which turned into a rock when the woman struck it with a stick. The Irish name has also been anglicised as 'Innisboffin' and 'Boffin' or 'Bophin' island. Geology and topography Islands off County Mayo-County Galway Inishbofin lies around off the Connemara coast opposite of Ballinakill Harbour and Cleggan Bay. It is separated by a narrow channel from Inishark (Shark island). It is about long and wide. The highest point is in the Westquarter and rises to . Much of the island is a Special Area of Conservation (due to the presence of corn crakes and seals). The island has no trees or forests whatsoever. Any wood was cut down and used as heating fuel. Because of the salt-enriched air, trees were never able to re-establish themselves. History It is not known when Inishbofin was first settled. There is no evidence of a Mesolithic, and only circumstantial evidence of a significant Neolithic presence. Although there are pre-historic field systems, their age has not been definitely established and could be anywhere between Bronze Age and early Medieval. Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments, found in significant numbers on the Connemara mainland, are conspicuous by their absence. Definite traces of human settlement are available only from the Iron Age onwards, such as the remains of promontory ring forts like 'Dun Mor'. Around 665, Saint Colm√°n founded a monastery on Inishbofin. According to some accounts, Guairim of Inisbofin was the ruler of the island when Colm√°n came here. The Annals of the Four Masters report the monastery's Abbots until the early 10th century (see below). The island belonged to the O'Flahertys until 1380, when the O'Malleys captured it. In the 16th century, according to local tradition, a Spanish pirate or Barbary corsair named Alonzo Bosco built a stronghold on Port Island, where the Cromwellian fort stands today. According to the tales he raided the Irish coast and shipping in the area. \\"Don\\" Bosco was supposed to have been an ally of Gr√°inne O'Malley, chieftain of the O'Malley clan and 'Ireland's pirate queen'. One story had them stretching a defensive iron chain across Inishbofin's harbour entrance to make it impassable to enemy ships. Across the harbour entrance from Port Island sits 'D√∫n Gr√°inne', the fort where Gr√°inne O'Malley supposedly lived. Eventually, Elizabethean forces took the island. In 1609, both Inishbofin and Inishark were the property of the Earl (or Marquis) of Clanricard (alternatively spelled Clanricarde or Clanrickard). The Marquis was of the de Burgo (Burke) family. Inishbofin harbour, Port Island with Cromwell's Barracks and the light on Gun Rock, with Inis Goirt in the background. In the years of war following the Irish rebellion of 1641, the island was an important staging posts for arms deliveries to the Irish Catholic rebels and their allies, the Royalists, from the Duke of Lorraine. The Royalists were supporters of King Charles I of England in the English Civil War against the Parliamentarians. In August 1649, the Parliamentarian forces under Oliver Cromwell had landed in Ireland and over the next few years conquered it. In early 1653, Cromwellian warships threatened to bombard the island and Inishbofin surrendered on 14 February to Sir John Reynolds. It was thus one of the last Royalist strongholds to fall to Cromwell's army. According to some accounts, after Galway had fallen in 1652, Rory O'Moore, one of the initiators of the 1641 rebellion fled to Inishbofin, where he lived in a cave. After taking the island, the Parliamentary forces turned Inishbofin into a prison for Catholic priests arrested elsewhere in Ireland. Most of the star fort commanding the harbour dates from this period. It is known today as \\"Cromwell's Barracks\\" and was used, aside from its role as a prison, to protect the harbour against pirates and Dutch raiders (with whom the Protectorate was at war). At the time, a considerable fishery and whaling activity was based on the island. In 1690, the fort was garrisoned during the Williamite War in Ireland by Jacobites, supporters of King James II of England. Commanded by one Colonel O'Riordan, they surrendered to King William's forces soon after the fall of Galway in 1691. In 1779, a British ship carrying officers and new recruits of the 84th Regiment of Foot and the King's Orange Rangers, diverted from their planned course from Newfoundland to New York City during the American War of Independence, was blown off course and wrecked at Inishbofin (Royal Oak Cove). 56 of the soldiers died, many of the survivors deserted and were hunted down by troops from Westport. Around 1830, Inishbofin passed from the possession of the Clanricards to the Browne family of Westport, descendants of the O'Malleys. In 1837, the island was in the Barony of Murrisk, County of Mayo, and Province of Connaught. It belonged to Howe Browne, 2nd Marquess of Sligo. Circa 1855, George Browne sold the island to Henry William Wilberforce. Cyril Allies, an English Catholic, bought it from Wilberforce in 1876, after having held it in mortgage since 1859. It was eventually acquired by the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (later known as the Land Commission). The exact date is not known, but negotiations were \\"well advanced\\" by 1910. As of 1 February 1873, Inishbofin (as in the Civil Parish of Inishbofin which included Inishark as well) was no longer legally part of County Mayo but had become a part of County Galway. this was a consequence of a severe localised famine in the winter of 1872/3 which necessitated relief be organised via the nearer Poor Law Union based in Clifden Workhouse rather than the previously responsible Poor Law Union based around Louisburgh Workhouse and in view of the particular concentration of distress in West Connemara and Inishbofin/Inishark. = Demographics = The table below reports data on Inishbofin's population taken from Discover the Islands of Ireland (Alex Ritsema, Collins Press, 1999) and the Census of Ireland. Censuses in Ireland before 1841 are not considered complete and/or reliable. Dumhach Beach in the east of Inishbofin The island's population has shrunk dramatically since pre-famine times. In 1837, 1462 people lived on Inishbofin. By 1881, the number was down to 959. In 1990, there were around 200 inhabitants, the 2011 Census found just 160 inhabitants. Today, tourism is the island's main industry. There are three hotels and a hostel on the island. Inishbofin offers scuba diving, walking trails, cycling, horse riding, sailing, paddle boarding, kayaking, snorkelling, shore and sea angling. Transport Inishbofin can be reached by ferry from the pier in Cleggan. There is also a helipad, and an airstrip has been built on the island. However, despite the Inishbofin and Cleggan airfields costing almost EUR10 million to build and continuing to cost hundreds of thousands annually to maintain, neither airstrip is licensed for use and general aviation pilots are forbidden to land on them.https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/taxpayers-foot-bill- for-10m-airstrips-lying-idle-for-a-decade-895268.html Culture and sports The island features a football pitch and a community centre with an indoor sports hall. It also houses a small island library which provides a reference and local studies collection with information on the history and heritage of the area. Inishbofin hosted the 2008 All-Ireland Islands Football Tournament, and again in September 2017. The current Galway Senior Men's Football team goalkeeper, Ruairi Lavelle, hails from Inishbofin. Another islander, Michael Day, also made his debut in midfield for the Senior team in 2017.

It is named after a knee-shaped water-filled rock hole at the base of Uluru, and is located in the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. Its people are traditional owners and joint managers of the park with Parks Australia. At the 2011 census, Mutitjulu had a population of 296, of which 218 (71.2%) were Aboriginal. The majority of the Anangu (people) are Pitjantjatjara but there are also associated Yankunytjatjara, Luritja and Ngaanyatjarra people with the languages spoken being Pitjantjatjara, Luritja and Yankunytjatjara. Arrernte people also have a traditional relationship with Uluru. Tourism Mutitjulu community run a number of guided tours for tourists visiting Uluru, who show tourists certain sites, and share Tjukurpa the story of Uluru, as well as of its inhabitants. These tours are called Anangu Tours, from the Pitjantjatjara word Anangu which means \\"people\\". Access to the community is controlled by Anangu, who do not allow visitors to go to Mutitjulu community without permission. The community reserves the right to forbid visitors from entering their land. The people of Mutitjulu are also the traditional owners of Uluru, and have an art exhibition there where they sell paintings and other artefacts. Economy Much of the economy of Mutitjulu comes from tourism at Uluru and nearby Yulara, a small proportion of which is funnelled back to the local economy. Despite this, Mutitjulu is not wealthier than most other Indigenous Australian communities. Art centre Maruku Arts & Crafts is a large and successful Aboriginal Australian-owned and -operated enterprise, run by Anangu (people of the Western and Central Deserts of Australia) since about 1990. It has a warehouse based in Mutitjulu, a retail gallery at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Cultural Centre, as well as a market stall in Yulara town square. Its artwork consists mainly of paintings and woodcarvings. With about 900 artists in the collective, it provides an important source of income living in remote communities across central Australia. It seeks to \\"keep culture strong and alive, for future generations of artists, and [to] make culture accessible in an authentic way to those that seek a more in-depth understanding\\". Maruku is one of ten Indigenous-owned and -governed enterprises that go to make up the APY Art Centre Collective, established in 2013. Education The community has a school which services students from Year 1 to Year 7, and a high school, Nyangatjatjara College. The cultural traditions of Mutitjulu dictate that once reaching adolescence, children must be taught only with peers of the same sex. Nyangatjatjara College is a boarding school, and hosts the young men and young women of the community separately in consecutive semesters. As with housing and health, Anglo- European education standards at Mutitjulu, are far lower than the Australian average. Language Languages spoken are Pitjantjatjara, Luritja and Yankunytjatjara. Communication between the languages, however, is not difficult as most residents speak several languages and these Aboriginal languages are closely related, all being mutually intelligibly varieties of the Western Desert Language. Efforts are made to preserve traditional customs, including traditional languages, but some English is spoken by most residents. The level of English literacy by Mutitjulu residents is higher than in many Indigenous Australian communities primarily due to the regular exposure to tourists at Uluru. Relationship to Uluru Many stories have been told by Indigenous Australians from all around Central Australia about Uluru. Some of these stories are recreated in paintings and artwork, and many relate to the dreamtime. Uluru is seen as having an explanation for why we are humans, and the stories help to describe much of the surrounding flora and fauna. =Climbing of Uluru= The local Indigenous community from 1990 requested that visitors respect the sacred status of Uluru by not climbing the rock, with signs posted to this effect in late 1989. In 2017 the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park board decided unanimously to ban the activity, from October 26, 2019. =Ownership of Uluru= The Anangu consider themselves caretakers rather than owners of Uluru. For many years, Uluru was controlled by non- Aboriginal Australians, with motels placed close by. Traditional owners who had been forced out of the national park returned and settled at Mutitjulu, and worked towards restoring their land rights. Tourist facilities have been moved about 24 km north to Yulara, just outside the national park boundary. Title handback Title to the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park was returned to the traditional owners on 26 October 1985.

Portuguese in Persian Gulf in the 16th and 17th centuries. Main cities, ports and routes. Sohar (, also Romanized as Su·∏•ƒÅr) is the capital and largest city of the Al Batinah North Governorate in Oman. An ancient capital of the country that once served as an important Islamic port town, Suhar has also been credited as the mythical birthplace of Sinbad the Sailor. According to the 2010 census, Suhar's population was 140,006, making it Oman's fifth most-populated settlement. Described as an industrial town, the development of the Sohar Industrial Port during the 2000s has transformed it into a major Omani industrial hub.  History  As the largest town in the region, it has been argued that Suhar is identified with the ancient town called 'Omanah' () mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History. This settlement is believed to have given Oman its name. According to Al-Tabari, in 893 or 894, during the Abbasid era, there was a dispute about who should rule Oman amongst local factions. A faction that approached the Abbasids was the Bani Sama, who were based in Al-Buraimi or Tawam, before moving to Sohar. Bani Sama also referred to themselves as the Wajihid Dynasty, and assumed leadership over the region. The present-day town of al-Buraimi is part of a historical region that Tabari referred to as 'Tawam', which nowadays also includes the adjacent UAE city of Al Ain. By the 10th century, Sohar was one of the richest ports of the Persian Gulf. It was praised by Ibn Hawqal and al- Muqadsasƒ´, who called it \\"flourishing, populous, beautiful, pleasant and delightful\\" and compared it favourably with the ports of China. Aloes, wood, bamboo, sandalwood and spices were brought from India and frankincense from Dhofar. The city was sacked by the Buwayhids in 971 and its trade went into decline. It also suffered from attacks by the merchants of Kish across the gulf. By the 13th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Hormuz. It was still an international port until at least the 16th century.Dionisius A. Agius, Seafaring in the Arabian Gulf and Oman: People of the Dhow (Routledge, 2005), pp. 76‚Äì77. = Portuguese = In the early 16th century , Sohar was conquered by the Portuguese empire , to control the entrances of the Persian Gulf and trade in the Region.It was part of a web of fortress that the Portuguese had in the region , from Bahrain to Hormuz. It was drawn in the 17th century as it appears in the Ant√≥nio Bocarro Book of fortress.  Industry  Suhar is currently experiencing significant investment and economic shifts making it the focus of attention of many local and international investors and businessmen. This change is due to a series of investment projects and economic giant in Suhar industrial area where Port of Sohar is located. Established in 2002, the port has a strategic importance due to its nearness to the Strait of Hormuz. It is operated by Suhar Industrial Port Company (SIPC) and it is considered a world class port. With current investments exceeding $12 billion, it is one of the world‚Äôs largest port development projects. The Omani government has paid special attention to the city of Suhar, and placed it in the priorities of the future plan of the Omani economy in 2020. The goal of the Omani government is to make Suhar a business and industrial hub and help the Omani economy diversify away from oil. In order for the Omani economy to achieve this economic diversification, the Omani government is investing in a number of projects in the industrial area of Suhar. For example, it is investing more than $5 billion in the steel industry in which Oman aims to be one of the Gulf Cooperation Council's leading producers. In addition to the steel industry, there is also the industry of aluminium in Suhar industrial area. Sohar Aluminium Company was established in 2004 and it is considered one of the leading projects that play a major role in the sultanate‚Äôs economic diversification strategy.  Education  Suhar has four high educational institutes: * Sohar University ‚Äì a private university in association with the University of Queensland. * Sohar College of Applied Sciences ‚Äì a government owned college. * Oman Medical College ‚Äì a private university in association with West Virginia University School of Medicine. * International Maritime College Oman Suhar also has a number of international schools such as: * Al Batinah International School (owned by Sohar Aluminium & ORPIC) ‚Äì only IB SCHOOL http://abisoman.com/ * Sohar International School(S.I.S) * Indian School Sohar * Pakistan School Sohar *Bengladesh School Sohar  Climate  Suhar has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh) with very hot summers and mild winters. Precipitation is low; more than half of the year's total rainfall falls in February, and summers are almost completely dry.  Parks  Suhar has four main parks. The first is Suhar Park, located in Al Humbar. The second is the Silver Jubilee Park which is located in Sallan. The third is the Entertainment Park in Sanaiyyah. The fourth is in falaj alqabail.

Design work on the prototype space gun began as early as 1985 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and became operational in December 1992. It is the largest gas gun in the world. Design and operation Rather than a single straight barrel, the SHARP gun uses an L-shape design with two separate sections; the long steel combustion section & pump tube section is connected to the long launch tube (or barrel) at a right angle. 100-ton rail-mounted sleds sit at both ends of the pump tube to absorb recoil energy from firing and a smaller 10-ton sled is mounted on a perpendicular set of tracks at the aft-end of the launch-tube near the junction point. The firing sequence begins with the ignition of a methane gas mixture in the combustion section behind the piston at the far end of the pump tube. The resultant explosion rapidly drives the 1-ton steel piston down the pump tube and further compresses the pre-pressurized hydrogen gas that fills the other end of the pump tube. As the piston accelerates toward the junction point, it rapidly compresses the hydrogen gas in the pump tube to a pressure of . The small projectile, meanwhile, rests in the adjacent depressurized launch tube. As the hydrogen gas reaches maximum pressure, a coupling holding the projectile in place is destroyed and the hydrogen drives the projectile down a 4-in diameter barrel at extremely high velocities until it bursts through a thin plastic sheet covering the end of the gun. All recoil forces are absorbed by the rail- mounted sleds as they are propelled outwards along their tracks. Tests and cancellation Headed by John Hunter, the SHARP gun fired projectiles using expanding hydrogen and achieved velocities of or Mach 8.8 for projectiles. Had the project continued, there were plans to elevate the tube and begin space launch trials potentially reaching speeds of up to , or about Mach 21. The tests were designed as a precursor to the \\"Jules Verne Launcher,\\" an even larger light-gas gun with a barrel length designed in the early 1990s for first-stage satellite launch. This was to cost $1 billion, but funding was not forthcoming and the project was eventually canceled in 1995. However, the SHARP gun continued to be used for high-speed tests in other areas of research, such as scramjet development. The concept of ballistic escape velocity is well proven. The largest challenge is maintaining such high velocities, because air resistance and aerothermal heating will significantly slow down any such object.

After a period of driving when a turbocharger has been working hard, it is important to let the engine run at idle speed for a period, allowing the compressor assembly to cool from the lower gas temperatures in both the exhaust and intake tracts. At the same time the lubricating oil from the engine is able to circulate properly so the turbine won't burn the lubricating oil that would otherwise be trapped within the charger with the turbine rotating at high speed. With regard to modern automotive turbochargers, the need for a turbo timer can be eliminated by simply ensuring the car does not produce any 'boost' (during driving) for several minutes prior to the ignition being shut off. Most turbo timers are based on digital electronics. Turbo timers can usually be disabled by an external switch, this is normally done using the handbrake switch, or using an automatic one.

Rejection of \\"Aryan invasion\\" Shaffer is known for his studies on the Indus Valley Civilization. According to him, there is no archaeological indication of an Aryan migration into northwestern India during or after the decline of the Harappan city culture. Instead, Shaffer has argued for \\"a series of cultural changes reflecting indigenous cultural developments.\\" According to Shaffer, linguistic change has mistakenly been attributed to migrations of people. Shaffer gives two possible alternative explanations for the similarities between Sanskrit and western languages. The first is a linguistic relationship with a \\"Zagrosian family of language linking Elamite and Dravidian on the Iranian Plateau,\\" as proposed by McAlpin; according to Shaffer \\"linguistic similarities may have diffused west from the plateau as a result of the extensive trading networks linking cultures in the plateau with those in Mesopotamia and beyond,\\" while also linking with the Kelteminar culture in Central Asia. Yet, Shaffer also notes that the Harappan culture was not extensively tied to this network in the third century BCE, leaving the possibility that \\"membership in a basic linguistic family - Zagrosian - may account for some of the linguistic similarities of later periods.\\" The second possibility is that \\"such linguistic similarities are a result of post-second millennium B.C. contacts with the west.\\" According to Shaffer, \\"[o]nce codified, it was advantageous for the emerging hereditary social elites to stabilize such linguistic traits with the validity of the explanations offered in the literature enhancing their social position.\\" Publications * *Prehistoric Baluchistan: With Excavation Report on Said Qala Tepe. *A Honaki Phase Site on the Lower Verde River, Arizona.  * Notes References Sources External links * Curriculum vitae * Faculty webpage Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:American anthropologists Category:American archaeologists Category:Arizona State University alumni Category:People associated with the Indus Valley Civilisation Category:Indigenous Aryanism ","title":"Jim G.

Despite gaining popularity around the time of the Bay Area hyphy movement, The Frontline are not associated as hyphy artists. Their lyrics are more socially conscious than most Bay Area rappers. One of the issues that has been brought up in multiple songs is being positive role models for youths. While they are not opposed to gangster rap and rapping about previous transgressions, Lock and Left don't consistently make records about violence and do not romanticize it. Their hometown, Richmond, CA has one of the top homicide rates not only in CA, but in the United States. Neither rapper smokes or drinks alcohol, nor glorifies it in their songs. While promoting their second album, Lock & Left, on Bay Area radio station 106.1 KMEL, they discussed the downside to drugs and alcohol abuse. Much of their work has been produced by E-A-SKI. Lock and Left are both UC Berkeley Graduates (LEFT recently earned a PhD in African Diaspora Studies) https://twitter.com/leftsentthis.

Its main 5,102-seat arena which is known as Westoba Place is the home of the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Western Hockey League and the annual Royal Manitoba Winter Fair. History The original structure was built in 1973 and was known as the Keystone Centre. It was a joint venture between the City of Brandon, the Government of Manitoba, and the Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba, which organizes the Royal Fair each March. The Keystone Agricultural and Recreation Centre Inc., a non-profit corporation formed by the three parties, owns and operates the complex and grounds. The Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba contributed the original land and assets. The City of Brandon and the Province of Manitoba have agreed to cover any operating deficits of the Keystone Centre. The Keystone Centre was established through an agreement between the City of Brandon and the Province of Manitoba that saw the two parties share equally in any deficit of the Keystone. The Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba contributed the land and assets of the day, and the three parties formed the Leadership of the Corporation. A ten member board of Directors consisting of two representatives from the City of Brandon, two from the Province of Manitoba and two from the Provincial Exhibition, in addition to four members at large from the community appointed by the Leadership Group. The Corporation employs a general manager and staff who carry out the management and operation of the facility. There have been several expansions to the Keystone Centre. In 1982 approximately 30,000 square feet of space was added with the development of the Manitoba Room, Pioneer Lounge, and Amphitheatre. In 1992, in response to ever-growing needs in the community, a major expansion was completed which added 165,000 square feet of new tradeshow and recreation space. Today the Keystone Centre sits on approximately 90 acres in Brandon‚Äôs busiest commercial district and offers 540,000 square feet of multi-use all under one roof. As a significant contributor to the quality of life in Westman, the Keystone Centre plays an important role in the area of social and economic impact. Boasting over 1,500 event days annually, the Keystone Centre hosts a diverse array of activities providing a large component of the social, recreational, cultural and agricultural fabric of the area, and is one of Brandon‚Äôs largest economic catalysts. The Canad Inns hotel replaced the Manex Arena, the former home of the Wheat Kings. The complex underwent through an interior redesign in the summer of 2007. The Keystone Centre also features an exhibition hall for trade shows and agricultural events, two smaller hockey arenas, and the Brandon Curling Club. On May 1, 2007, Westman Communications Group purchased the naming rights to the main arena and viewing lounge. Westman Communications Group ended their naming rights to the main arena in October, 2017, and signage was removed in January, 2018. On February 2, 2018, Westoba Credit Union purchased the naming rights to the main arena and viewing lounge. Events The Westoba Place hosted the 2010 Memorial Cup. Other major events held at the Keystone Centre include the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships (co-hosted with Winnipeg), the 1995 Ford Men's and Women's World Curling Championships, the 1982 Labatt Brier, the 1993 and 2002 Scott Tournament of Hearts, the 1997 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, and the 1994 Air Canada Cup. On October 13, 2017, Curling Canada announced that the 2019 Tim Hortons Brier will take place at the Keystone Centre from March 2nd to 10th. The Western Canadian Junior \\"B\\" Hockey Championship, the Keystone Cup, is named after the Keystone Centre as it was the alternate site used by the original tournament in 1983 that took place in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.

The building shared the same parking lot with the Town 'N' Country Mall, Moose Jaw's only indoor shopping centre. Designed by Saskatchewan architect Joseph Pettick and Vancouver structural engineer J.L. Miller, the Civic Centre won the Massey Medal for architecture, a precursor to Canada's Governor General's Medals in Architecture. The innovative cable structure roof that gave the building its unique shape, was an ingenious and cost effective solution that allowed such a large building to be constructed on a modest budget, while maintaining an unobstructed view of the arena surface from all seats. At the time it was built it was the largest cable structure in Canada. It earned the nickname of \\"The Crushed Can\\" because of its unusual shape. The impetus for the building was a fire that destroyed the old arena rink on Ross Street in the fall of 1955. City Council then appointed a group of citizens to oversee plans for a new building. The building was officially opened as The Moose Jaw Community Centre on September 19, 1959, with a gala event hosted by Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas, and featuring a performance by Louis Armstrong & His All-Stars. Alt URL After initial tenders in the range of one million dollars, the length of the building was shortened, and the final cost was a mere $525,000.00. The building opened on budget and debt free. Current replacement cost of the building would be in the tens of millions of dollars. Mosaic Place, completed in 2011, served as a replacement for the Moose Jaw Civic Centre. The City mothballed the Civic Centre in September 2011, and demolition was a possibility. Six private developers approached the city with plans to redevelop the building, and in April 2012 an agreement of sale was reached with Civic Centre Plaza Inc.

In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, pp. 44‚Äì45 Construction and career Tingey, named for Thomas Tingey, was laid down on 8 August 1918 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 24 April 1919; sponsored by Miss Mary Velora Arringdale; and commissioned on 25 July 1919, Commander Alfred W. Brown in command. After fitting out, the destroyer proceeded to the west coast and joined Division 31, Squadron 2, Flotilla 10, at San Diego, California late in December. For the next two and a half years, the destroyer operated out of San Diego with the Pacific Fleet. During most of that period, however, she had only 50 percent of her normal complement. Consequently, though she did conduct operations and patrols along the western coast of Mexico, she remained in a quasi-reserve status throughout her brief period of commissioned service. She made but one organizational change during her active career and that came in the latter part of 1921 when she was reassigned to Division 29, Squadron 10. In 1922, the anti-militarist feeling prevalent following World War I combined with the government's policy of financial retrenchment to cause the deactivation of a substantial portion of the Navy's recently expanded destroyer fleet; Tingey, therefore, was placed out of commission on 24 May 1922, berthed at San Diego, and remained there for the remainder of her career. After 14 years of inactivity, Tingey's name was struck from the Navy list on 19 May 1936. She was sold to the Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation, of New York City, on 29 September 1936 and was scrapped in December. See also *See for other ships of this name.

It competed with similar designs, the North American XB-45 and Martin XB-48, all of which saw little use after the successful development of the Boeing XB-47. Development In 1944, the War Department was aware of aviation advances in Germany and issued a requirement for a range of designs for medium bombers weighing from to more than . Other designs resulting from this competition, sometimes named the class of '45, included the North American XB-45 and the Martin XB-48. Procurement began with a letter contract (cost-plus-fixed-fee) on 17 January 1945 with mockup inspection and approval in early February. Orders for three prototypes followed on 27 February 1945 with certain changes recommended by the board. Serials 45-59582 to 59584 were assigned. Budgetary concerns also led to the contract being changed to a fixed-price type. In the fall of 1945, Convair found it was competing with itself when the USAAF became interested in an unorthodox forward-swept wing jet attack design, the XA-44-CO that the company had also been working on. With the end of World War II severely curtailing budgets, the company considered canceling the XB-46 in favor of the other project as there was insufficient funding for both. Company officials argued that it made more sense to allow them to complete the XB-46 prototype as a stripped-down testbed omitting armament and other equipment and for the AAF to allow them to proceed with two XA-44 airframes in lieu of the other two XB-46s on contract. In June 1946, the AAF agreed to the substitution but that project was ultimately cancelled in December 1946 before the prototypes were completed. The B-46 would be completed with only the equipment necessary to prove its airworthiness and handling characteristics. The XB-46 had a long streamlined oval torpedo-shaped fuselage, long narrow straight shoulder-mounted wings with four Chevrolet-built J35-C3 axial-flow eleven stage turbojets of static thrust paired in an integral nacelle under each wing. The fuselage turned out to be a problem, as it distorted under flight loads. The pilots sat in tandem in a pressurized fighter-style cockpit under a single Plexiglas teardrop canopy with the bombardier-navigator-radio operator in a transparent Plexiglas nose section. XB-46 aileron and spoiler detail The straight wing had an aspect ratio of 11.6, and was equipped with Fowler flaps which extended over 90 percent of the span, in four sections. The flaps extended via electrical actuators, and had very small ailerons. Each wing had five spoilers made of perforated magnesium alloy. The engine air intakes were flat oval inlets, with a duct curving downward in a flat ‚ÄúS‚Äù to the engines, which were mounted behind the leading edge of the wing. The unusual flight control system utilized a system of pneumatic piping to transmit the pilots control inputs and actuate various systems, rather than the more typical hydraulic, manual or electrical control lines and systems of most aircraft of the era. Production versions were to be equipped with a pair of .50 caliber Browning M2 machine guns in a tail turret designed by Emerson Electric Company and provision was made for an APG-27 remote control optics and sighting system, but no weaponry was fitted into the prototype. Likewise, production aircraft were intended to be built with the General Electric J47 engines with static thrust rather than the J35s used on the prototype. Testing The XB-46's first flight occurred 2 April 1947 after a month of taxi testing, and lasted ninety minutes as the bomber departed the Convair plant in San Diego, California for Muroc Army Airfield in the high desert. The pilot praised its handling qualities. Basic flight testing took place for five months, and by September 1947 it was concluded after 127 hours aloft on 64 flights by both the Convair company and AAF test pilots. Stability and control were excellent but there were engineering problems with engine de-icing, the cabin air system, and vertical oscillations caused by harmonic resonance between the wing and spoilers. There was also concern regarding the ability of the three man crew to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency, since the exit plan relied on the pneumatic system to hold the main door open against the airstream. The aircraft was accepted on 7 November and delivered on 12 November 1947. Cancellation The B-46 program was cancelled in August 1947, even before flight testing had been completed, because it was already obsolete. The North American B-45 Tornado already had production orders, and even it would be eclipsed by the Boeing B-47 Stratojet's superior performance. Furthermore, the bulky radar fire- control system which was not installed in the XB-46 prototype would have undoubtedly forced an expensive redesign of the slender fuselage. Subsequent testing investigated excessive noise, tail vibration, and stability and control issues, and was conducted at Palm Beach Air Force Base, Florida between August 1948 and August 1949. After 44 additional flight hours, the XB-46 was taken out of service, since the cost of support and maintenance, coupled with a lack of spare parts, had become prohibitive. After sitting idle for a year, it was flown to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in July 1950, where its pneumatic system was tested under the coldest conditions in the large climatic facility there. Most jet aircraft of this period used hydraulic or electrical systems, so the pneumatic control system of this aircraft offered a unique opportunity for investigation. When this testing program was concluded in November 1950, the Air Force no longer had need for the XB-46, a fact acknowledged in the press as early as August,Fort Walton Beach, Florida, \\"XB-46 Bomber to Undergo Tests in Climatic Hangar\\", Playground News, Thursday 3 August 1950, Volume 5, Number 27, page 3. and on 13 January 1951 the nose section was sent to the U.S. Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, although it appears that the airframe section has not survived in the collection. The rest of the airframe was scrapped on 28 February 1952.

UOB Plaza One was one of the three tallest in the city, sharing the title with the OUB Centre and Republic Plaza, but it is now the second tallest since the construction of Tanjong Pagar Centre in 2016. UOB Plaza Two is a shorter and older building with construction completed in 1973 and was later renovated in 1995 with a similar facade as UOB Plaza One. Both buildings are connected by a podium supported by four columns. The podium houses the banking hall of the United Overseas Bank's main branch. The building was opened by then Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 6 August 1995 which was 60 years after the founding of the United Overseas Bank. Overview The UOB Plaza is a 280.1 m tall 66-floor high-rise, three-story underground building built at Raffles Place, Singapore's Central Business District, along the Singapore River. It is a box-shaped post-modernism building which was designed by Kenzo Tange, a renowned Japanese architect, and was constructed by Nishimatsu Construction and Lum Chang JV. It was completed in 1992. Built as the head office of the United Overseas Bank, one of Singapore's leading banks, the building was also one of the country's tallest skyscrapers along with the adjoining OUB Center and Republic Plaza until it was succeeded by the Tanjong Pagar Centre. There are two buildings that make up the Plaza, which are divided into the high-rise \\"Plaza 1 (UOB Plaza One)\\" and the low-rise \\"Plaza (UOB Plaza Two)\\". Among them, \\"Plaza 2\\" was built in 1973 before it was remodeled in 1995. The materials, colors, shapes and overall image of the building closely resembles the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, which was completed in Shinjuku, Tokyo in 1990 which was also designed by Kenzo Tange. UOB Plaza Two UOB Plaza Two is a building with 38 floors and was completed in 1973 with the building reconstructed again in 1995. The building was formerly called the Bonham Building and housed the former United Chinese Bank (now the United Overseas Bank) before it changed to the current name in 1965. Architecture The towers have an octagonal base and consists of rotated cubic volumes, which is a distinctive stylistic expression of Kenzo Tange's works in the 1990s. The cubic volumes on the octagonal base, they rotate on a 45 degree plane of reference and diminish in volume towards the top of UOB Plaza One. A six-storey podium links the two buildings together and skillfully accommodates the reconstructed UOB Building (now UOB Plaza 2). This place is a large airy atrium linking Raffles Place to Singapore River without entering the building. The banking hall has full height glass walls to see through the Singapore River from the financial district. The change in lighting brings out the geometric qualities of the building's architecture, highlighting the buildings with shafts of light and shadow. The external curtain wall system of the building represents a significant and innovative contribution of the evolution of building facades over time. The \\"performance wall\\" envelope of the towers is a composite of white and grey granite and insulated grey glass units. The atrium is also known as a \\"city room\\" and above it has a large office space and a large skylight, which gives the place natural lighting. A double storey sky lobby could be found on the 37th and 38th floors, which provide panoramic views of the city. It is also used for workers to transfer lifts from the lower floors to the higher floors. However, the sky lobby has been closed to the public due to security reasons after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

MacProject was one of the first major business tools for the Macintosh which enabled users to calculate the \\"critical path\\" to completion and estimate costs in money and time. If a project deadline was missed or if available resources changed, MacProject recalculated everything automatically. MacProject was written by Debra Willrett at Solosoft, and was published and distributed by Apple Computer to promote the original Macintosh personal computer. It was developed from an earlier application written by Debra Willrett for Apple's Lisa computer, LisaProject. This was the first graphical user interface (GUI) for project management. There were many other project management applications on the market at the time, but LisaProject was the first to simplify the process by allowing the user to interactively draw their project on the computer in the form of a PERT chart. Constraints could be entered for each task, and the relationships between tasks would show which ones had to be completed before a task could begin. Given the task constraints and relationships, a \\"critical path\\", schedule and budget could be calculated dynamically using heuristic methods. One of the early proponents of MacProject was James Halcomb, a well known expert in the use of the Critical Path Method. Having supervised hand- drawn network diagrams for countless complex projects, Halcomb immediately recognized the promise of the WYSIWYG graphical interface and computerized calculation of the critical path. Using a Lisa computer housed in a case designed to fit under an airplane seat, Mr. Halcomb traveled the United States demonstrating this new technology in his CPM courses. In consultation with the software's developers he authored the book Planning Big with MacProject, which introduced a generation of Mac users to PERT and CPM. In December 1987, an updated version of MacProject, called MacProject II, was introduced as a part of Claris's move to update its suite of Mac office applications. In 1991, Microsoft Project was ported to the Macintosh from Microsoft Windows and became MacProject's main competitor. However, after the release of version 3.0 of Microsoft Project in 1993, Microsoft terminated support of the Macintosh release. MacProject 1.0 is not Y2K-compliant as it cannot schedule tasks past 1999.

It formerly shared the title of \\"tallest building\\" with the OUB Centre and UOB Plaza One, until the completion of Tanjong Pagar Centre in 2016. At a height of 280 meters, it was officially opened on 18 January 1998 and incorporates earthquake proof features despite the city being relatively far from earthquake zones. Republic Plaza houses the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the largest bank in Japan, and its various subsidiaries on almost 15 floors; the Honorary Consulate of Mali on the 32nd floor and the Honorary Consulate of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on the 58th floor of the building. Designed by Kisho Kurokawa, the building was constructed by Shimizu Corporation. The building is owned and operated by City Developments Limited. Architecture A simple square form with chamfered corners at the base was adopted for the design of the tower, with the main entrance at D'Almeida Street. The tower tapers as it rises, forming some triangular elements, to reduce buffeting due to strong winds and improve wind loading. As with many other towers, it consists of a central core containing basic functions such as emergency stairways and elevator shafts, wrapped around by lettable office space. Other items particular to the building: *The tower is turned 45 degrees from the axis of the ground floor level to maintain sea views from the upper floors. *The building has 15 double-decker vertical lifts. *The tower was designed to reflect a subtle Oriental influence. *The main lobby is four storeys high, finished in polished granite and ceramics. *The lobby is framed by concrete-filled tubular steel columns. *The exterior fa√ßade transitions from granite with strip windows to tinted wall glass, smoothly inclining from an octagonal base to a square top. *The tower rose rapidly despite building complications which included an MRT line beside the site, historically important buildings nearby, as well as natural boulders and abandoned piles underground. *The tower was built on a caisson with more than 900 mini piles. *The construction was completed in just under two years using the fast track process. *A total of 8,600 tons of structural steel and 31,000 cubic metres of concrete was used. *After nightfall, only the glass top is visible when it is lit from within. *Office Lettable Area: *Retail Lettable Area: See also * List of tallest buildings in Singapore References Category:Office buildings completed in 1995 Category:City Developments Limited Category:Raffles Place Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Singapore Category:Downtown Core (Singapore) Category:Kisho Kurokawa buildings Category:Shimizu Corporation ","title":"Republic Plaza (Singapore)"},{"id":"1922122","text":"A cascade tax or cascading tax is a turnover tax that is applied at every stage in the supply chain, without any deduction for the tax paid at earlier stages.

Eichner (March 23, 1937February 10, 1988) was an American post- Keynesian economist who challenged the neoclassical price mechanism and asserted that prices are not set through supply and demand but rather through mark-up pricing. Eichner is one of the founders of the post-Keynesian school of economics and was a professor at Rutgers University at the time of his death. Eichner's writings and advocacy of thought, differed with the theories of John Maynard Keynes, who was an advocate of government intervention in the free market and proponent of public spending to increase employment. Eichner argued that investment was the key to economic expansion. He was considered an advocate of the concept that government incomes policy should prevent inflationary wage and price settlements in connection to the customary fiscal and monetary means of regulating the economy. He is noted for his book The Megacorp and Oligopoly (1976), Toward a new economics: essays in post- Keynesian and institutionalist theory (1985). His Macrodynamics of Advanced Market Economies (1987) contains chapters on dynamics and growth, investment, finance and income distribution. Life and work Eichner was born in Washington, D.C., in the United States. He received his doctorate in economics from Columbia University. He taught at Columbia from 1962 until 1971. Later he taught at SUNY Purchase (1971‚Äì1980), and then joined the Rutgers University faculty. Some books edited by Eichner include A Guide to Post-Keynesian Economics, Why Economics Is Not Yet a Science, and The Macrodynamics of Advanced Market Economies. Eichner testified before Congressional and other legislative committees Historian of culture and of economics Together with Eli Ginzberg, a professor of economics at Columbia, Eichner authored an economic history of African Americans, The Troublesome Presence: The American Democracy and the Negro, published in 1964. These co-authors wrote that... ‚Äúof the several million persons who reached Great Britain‚Äôs North American colonies before 1776, it is conservatively estimated that close to 80 percent arrived under some form of servitude.‚Äù The science of economics? Some mainstream economists have argued that assumptions about the character of economic reality in the neoclassical economic paradigm are fundamentally flawed. Points arguably making a convincing case that the mathematical theories used by neoclassical economists cannot be viewed as scientific have consistently been made by trained economists. Alfred Eichner in Why Economics Is Not Yet a Science offers the following commentary on the discipline of economics as a social system: ....'The refusal to abandon the myth of the market as a self-regulating system is not the result of a conspiracy on the part of the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù in economics. It is not even a choice that any individual economist is necessarily aware of making. Rather it is the way economics operates as a social system‚Äîincluding the way new members of the establishment are selected‚Äîretaining its place within the larger society by perpetuating a set of ideas which have been found useful by that society, however dysfunctional the same set of ideas may be from a scientific understanding of how the economic system works. In other words, economics is unwilling to adhere to the epistemological principles which distinguish scientific from other types of intellectual activity because this might jeopardize the position of economists within the larger society as the defender of the dominant faith. This situation in which economists find themselves is therefore not unlike that of many natural scientists who, when faced with mounting evidence in support of first, the Copernican theory of the universe and then, later, the Darwinian theory of evolution, had to decide whether undermining the revelatory basis of Judeo-Christian ethics was not too great a price to pay for being able to reveal the truth.'http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Retrieved Aug-25-09 Lead Author: Robert Nadeau.

The company made domestic appliances and personal care products. Originally a German consumer electronic company, Grundig GmbH was founded in 1945 by Max Grundig and eventually headquartered in Nuremberg. It grew to become one of the leading radio, TV, recorder and other electronics goods manufacturers of Europe in the following decades of the 20 century. In the 1970s, Philips began acquiring Grundig AG's shares, leading to complete control in 1993. In 1998, Philips divested Grundig. In 2007, Ko√ß Holding bought Grundig and put the brand under its home appliances subsidiary Arcelik A.≈û. Ko√ß is a publicly- listed conglomerate with more than 80,000 employees. History Radio kit Heinzelmann (1945) Grundig melody boy 400 radio Grundig TK42 tape recorder Grundig began in 1945 with the establishment of a store named F√ºrth, Grundig & Wurzer (RVF), which sold radios and was headquartered in F√ºrth, northern Bavaria. After the Second World War, Max Grundig recognized the need for radios in Germany, and in 1947 produced a kit, while a factory and administration centre were built at F√ºrth. In 1951, the first television sets were manufactured at the new facility. At the time Grundig was the largest radio manufacturer in Europe. Divisions in Nuremberg, Frankfurt and Karlsruhe were established. In 2013, Grundig launched its home appliances (white goods) product range, becoming one of the mainstream manufacturers in Europe. Parent Arcelik A.≈û., has more than 27,000 employees worldwide. Grundig has manufacturing plants in several European cities that deliver Grundig products to more than 65 countries around the world. =1940s= Grundig started as a typical German company in 1945. Its early notability was due to Grundig radio. Max Grundig, a radio dealer, built a machine called \\"Heinzelmann,\\" which was a radio that did not use thermionic valves. The first of the same was named the 'Weltklang'. =1950s= Based on Heinzelmann success, Grundig started a factory. This allowed the company to start Grundig TV. This was created for the first German television channel which started in 1952. The company then developed a portable tape recorder and The Grundig Television Receiver 210. =1960s= A plant was opened in 1960 to manufacture tape recorders in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the first production by Grundig outside Germany. The managing director of the plant, Thomas Niedermayer, was kidnapped and later killed by the Provisional IRA in December 1973. The factory was closed with the loss of around 1000 jobs in 1980. =1970s= In 1972, Grundig GmbH became Grundig AG. After this Philips began to gradually accumulate shares in the company over the years, and assumed complete economic control in 1993. Grundig pulled out of this partnership in 1998 owing to unsatisfactory performance and the decline in Philips consumer electronics presence around the world. Grundig Colour TV with remote 1981 =1980s= Germany's first colour television projector was started by Grundig in 1981. The next year, the second generation electronic notepad was developed and marketed. Philips increased its stake in the company and Max Grundig no longer controlled business management in 1984. Grundig Fine Arts Digital Audio Tape-recorder DAT 9009 (1987-1990)hifiengine.com, 2006-2020, Grundig FineArts, retrieved 19 May 2020. =1990s= In 1991, Grundig entered the telephony equipment market starting with its cordless telephone. In 1993, the Grundig TV was based on a 16:9 picture format for signal transmission. In 1995 and 1996, the company included 3-D sound systems, TVs, satellite receivers and other initiatives that included interactive user guidance. However, Philips ended its stake in the company by 1997-8. =2000s= At the end of June 2000 the company relocated its headquarters in F√ºrth to Nuremberg-Langwasser. Grundig had a turnover of ‚Ç¨1.281 billion the following year. In autumn 2002, Grundig's banks did not extend the company's lines of credit, leaving the company with an April 2003 deadline to announce insolvency. Grundig AG declared bankruptcy in 2003. In 2004 Britain's Alba plc and the Turkish Ko√ß's Beko jointly took over Grundig Home InterMedia System, Grundig's consumer electronics division. In 2007 Alba sold its half of the business to Ko√ß for US$50.3 million, although it retained the license to use the Grundig brand in the UK until 2010, and in Australasia until 2012. In 2007 Grundig Mobile announced the U900 Linux-based mobile phone. At the end of 2007 Turkey's Ko√ß Holding, took full ownership of Grundig Multimedia, the parent company of Grundig Intermedia GmbH in Nuremberg. =2010s= The company continued on to entertainment electronics, electrical and home appliances.

History Raymond James was founded in 1962 when St. Petersburg broker, Robert James, formed Robert A. James Investments. In 1964, it merged with Raymond & Associates, founded by Edward Raymond in 1963, to form Raymond James & Associates. Robert James' son, Tom James, joined in 1966 and assumed leadership of the firm in 1970. The firm planned to go public in 1969, but market conditions delayed its plan until 1983. Tom turned over the CEO's post to Paul Reilly in 2010, and his title as Chairman of the Board to Paul Reilly in 2016. He remains on the leadership team as Chairman Emeritus. In 2012, the firm purchased the Canadian assets of Allied Irish Bank. In April 2012, they merged with Morgan Keegan & Company, creating one of the country's largest full-service wealth management and investment banking firms not headquartered in New York. As of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, the firm had delivered 123 consecutive quarters of profitability. In June 2016, it was listed as a Fortune 500 company for the first time. In September 2016, the firm announced its acquisition of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management's US private client services unit, Alex Brown & Sons. As of June 30, 2020, Raymond James has approximately 8,200 financial advisors throughout the United States, Canada and overseas. Total client assets under management are approximately $877 billion. The corporate headquarters is located in St. Petersburg, Florida. = Current operations = Raymond James has four main lines of operation: private client group, capital markets (made up of equity and fixed income capital markets as well as public finance), asset management group (made up of asset management services and Carillon tower advisers) and banking. Controversies =SEC v. Dennis Herula= In 2004, the SEC fined Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. $6.9 million for failure to supervise former broker Dennis Herula. Herula was accused of participating with others in a Ponzi scheme that raised about $44.5 million from investors in 1999-2000. Herula himself raised about $16.5 million of investor funds, most of which was later transferred to his wife's brokerage account at Raymond James. He was arrested in Bermuda and pleaded guilty to criminal charges of wire fraud and sentenced to 188 months in jail. =Supervision of branch managers= In 2005, the National Association of Securities Dealers fined Raymond James $2.75 million for lax supervision of producing branch managers. The investigation began with one Raymond James manager, who worked from an office in her Wisconsin home, handling approximately 700 accounts and selling mainly mutual funds and variable annuities. The Wisconsin manager was accused of selling unsuitable aggressive mutual funds and variable annuities over a four-year period. =Auction rate securities= On June 29, 2011, Raymond James announced an agreement to repurchase at par auction rate securities (ARS) sold to clients through its domestic broker/dealer subsidiaries prior to February 13, 2008. The agreement‚Äîreached with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with state securities regulators led by Florida and Texas‚Äîresolved more than three years of investigation related to activity in the ARS market. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm also agreed to pay a fine totaling $1.75 million to the state regulators, but was not fined by the SEC. As a result of this agreement, a pre-tax charge of $45 million was recorded in the quarter ending June 30, 2011. This charge was a result of an estimate of the current fair value of the securities to be repurchased by the company being less than their par value. It is expected that the ultimate realized loss will be substantially less as issuers refinance or redeem these securities, interest rates rise and/or collateral values improve. Raymond James sold $2.3 billion worth of ARS, underwrote $1.2 billion, and was the auction dealer for over $725 million. Since the $330 billion market for ARS crashed in 2008, at least 19 underwriters and broker-dealers were sued in class action suits. = Excessive commissions = In September 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ordered Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. to pay restitution of $1.69 million to 15,500 of their clients for charging excessive commissions on more than 27,000 securities transactions. The trades were made in client accounts between 2006 and 2010. FINRA also fined RJA $225,000 and RJFS $200,000. = Notable FINRA Fines = On May 18, 2016 Raymond James was fined $17 Million for Systemic Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Failures. \\"RJA was fined $8 million and RJFS was fined $9 million for failing to establish and implement adequate AML procedures, which resulted in the firms‚Äô failure to properly prevent or detect, investigate, and report suspicious activity for several years. RJA's former AML Compliance Officer, Linda L. Busby, was also fined $25,000 and suspended for three months.\\". On December 21, 2017 Raymond James was fined $2 million for failing to reasonably supervise email communications. \\"FINRA found that during a nine-year review period, Raymond James‚Äô email review system was flawed in significant respects, allowing millions of emails to evade meaningful review. This created the unreasonable risk that certain misconduct by firm personnel could go undetected by the firm. The combinations of words and phrases ‚Äì otherwise known as the ‚Äúlexicon‚Äù ‚Äì used to flag emails for review were not reasonably designed to detect certain potential misconduct that Raymond James, in light of its size, structure, business model, and experience from prior disciplinary actions, knew or should have anticipated would recur from time to time. The firm also failed to devote adequate personnel and resources to the team that reviewed emails flagged by the system, even as the number of emails increased over time.\\" See also Raymond James Stadium, a multi-purpose stadium in Tampa, Florida References Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Companies based in St. Petersburg, Florida Category:American companies established in 1962 Category:Financial services companies established in 1962 Category:Investment banks in the United States Category:Companies formed by merger ","title":"Raymond James Financial"},{"id":"1922156","text":"Maverick is a rapid transit station in Boston, Massachusetts. It serves the MBTA's Blue Line and is located at Maverick Square in East Boston. It is the easternmost underground station on the Blue Line and a transfer point to various buses. A center island platform provides access to the surface in the middle of Maverick Square. In the station, a track map lined with light bulbs shows the position of the trains on the Blue Line between Bowdoin and Orient Heights. It was one of the last stations to be converted to 6-car train service as part of the MBTA's Blue Line Renovation Project. History 1905 postcard of Maverick Portal When the East Boston Tunnel originally opened on December 30, 1904, it was a streetcar tunnel with a portal at Maverick, known as Maverick portal or the Maverick incline. There was no station at Maverick; streetcars simply left the portal and continued north on Meridian Street or southeast on Maverick Street. On April 18‚Äì21, 1924, the tunnel was converted to rapid transit and Maverick station opened, with the streetcar loop between the rapid transit platforms. The last streetcar lines to use the underground loop were the , , , , and ; these last ran January 4, 1952, the day before the Revere Extension to the rapid transit line opened. The streetcar loop and portal have since been closed, with parts of the incline now used for pedestrian access. The station has an extra-wide platform as a result of filling in the former streetcar tracks. The abandoned streetcar loop west of the station remains extant. The MBTA began design work of a renovation of the station in 1998. A $30.8 million construction contract, which also included ventilation work in the East Boston Tunnel, was awarded on May 5, 2005. Construction began on October 4, 2005. The work included extension of the platforms for six-car trains, replacement of the Maverick Square headhouse, addition of a new headhouse on Lewis Mall, and the creation of a dedicated busway in Maverick Square. Both headhouses included an elevator to make the station fully accessible. The Lewis Mall headhouse opened on September 22, 2007, allowing the old Maverick Square headhouse to be demolished that November. The renovation was completed in 2009. The final cost was $56.3 million, which included $12.4 million in change orders ‚Äì of which $8.9 million was due to design errors by the MBTA.

It is home to the Spokane Shock of the Indoor Football League and the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League. Facility =Construction= With an aging Spokane Coliseum, along with a need for a larger facility more than twice the coliseum's capacity, the Spokane City Council and Board of Spokane County Commissioners formed the Spokane Public Facilities District (SPFD) to acquire, construct, own and operate sports and entertainment facilities with contiguous parking facilities. In 1990, the SPFD board members unanimously agreed on the following recommendations made by an economic feasibility/market study. The recommendations were: *To build an arena opposed to a domed stadium *An arena that could seat 12,000 to 14,000 with expansion capabilities *To build the new arena on city-owned land located adjacent to the old coliseum with on-site parking for 2,000 automobiles Voters rejected the Spokane Arena four times in six years before agreeing to build it in 1991. In the fall of that year, two ballot measures were put out to voters, and passed: *One, to publicly finance the construction of the arena through a property tax bond issue worth US$38 million *Two, a measure to validate the SPFD. Validation was important, because it would allow the district to implement a 2% hotel tax to further fund construction. In the fall of 1991, another funding measure was put out to voters and was passed. It involved a 0.1% raise in the sales tax. The passage of all three measures completed the $44.8 million financining needed to build the arena. Ground was broken on March 5, 1993, and the Spokane Arena opened 2 years later, in September 1995. =Building facts= The Spokane Arena has a capacity for: *12,638 for end-stage concerts *12,494 for center-stage shows *12,210 for basketball *10,771 for arena football *10,366 for ice hockey *6,951 for half-house shows The arena has a state-of-the-art audio and video system. It consists of a Viacom Sports 12 mm LED display, which is capable of being used as two separate units. The video board has exceptional color reproduction and the best off-angle viewing available for any LED format. It can even be moved forward approximately and down to approximately off the arena floor. The arena also features a 350¬∞ color LED ribbon board, which is mounted on the fascia of the Spokane Arena bowl. It is capable of displaying text messages, animations, logos, scores and statistics. Powered by Crown Amplifiers, the audio system is driven by Community RS880 speakers in the Arena bowl, Altec Lansing satellite speakers for the upper seating areas, and Bose speakers serve the concourse, dressing rooms, and backstage hallways. Large public areas are one of the greater features of the Spokane Arena. The arena floor is , and the high concourse is a spacious . 16 luxury suites contain a total of 146 seats. In addition, there are six meeting rooms located at the Spokane Arena, totalling of meeting space. On the Events Level, there are five truck docks with x loading doors, one x drive-in door, and one x drive-in loading door, allowing large shows to load and unload eight trucks simultaneously. Trucks can load and unload unobstructed, directly into the marshalling area at the arena floor's west end. Backstage are three star dressing rooms, two promoter offices (located in the marshalling area), and seven team dressing rooms, as well as a dressing room for officials. The elevation at street level is approximately above sea level. =2012 expansion/future= Incorporated into its original design was an area designated for future expansion of the arena. Expansion of the upper bowl would raise the seating capacity of the arena to over 15,000. In 2011, the Spokane Public Facilities District became concerned the NCAA may tighten its criteria and require a true minimum of 12,000, with no allowance for seats lost due to tournament infrastructure. In early 2012, the Spokane Public Facilities District had \\"Measure 1\\" put on the April ballot, which was proposing to extend 0.1% sales tax and a 2% room tax to pay for a 91,000-square-foot addition to the Convention Center and other projects, including adding 750 seats to the Arena. Measure 1 was voted yes, and the 750 seats will eventually be added to the Arena. However, the seats that are to be added may have sight obstruction to the video wall, as it would be on the same side facing away. After this phase of new seating, full expansion of the arena including a center hung scoreboard and full seating expansion will cost roughly $3.547 million. It is unknown as to whether the PFD will max out the arena's capacity. Events =Sports= Basketball Spokane Arena, in addition to its duties as being the host of Chiefs and Shock games, also has served as a secondary home for the men's basketball programs of Gonzaga University and Washington State University for nearly every year since opened. Washington State has played 33 matchups in the Spokane Arena in 19 of the 22 years with a record of 18‚Äì15 (1‚Äì7 vs. ranked opponents), while Gonzaga has hosted 18 games in 15 of the 22 years with a record of 12‚Äì6 (1‚Äì2 vs. ranked opposition). In-state rivals Washington State and Gonzaga have faced off against each other in the arena on five occasions (1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2014) with the Zags owning a 3‚Äì2 record against the Cougars in those games. The Bulldogs' faced off against local rival Eastern Washington University at the arena in four consecutive years (2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005), each won by the Zags, but just like with the Cougars, the rivalry has gone dormant due to the rise of the Zags' program to major status since the late 1990s, while the Cougars and Eagles have not seen much national spotlight. Washington State has often hosted home games at the Spokane Arena as a part of its Pac-12 Conference men's basketball schedule, holding a 7‚Äì9 against conference foes in the arena, facing UCLA (1996 and 2004), Oregon (1997 and 2011), Oregon State (1997, 2011, and 2017), Arizona (1998, 2001, and 2006), Washington (1999), USC (2000 and 2004), Stanford (2004), California (2005), and Colorado (2014). With Gonzaga's rise to prominence, the Zags were able to bring high major schools like Washington (1998), Georgia (2003), Memphis (2007, 2009, and 2011) and Oklahoma (2009) to the Spokane Arena, with the Gonzaga holding a 2‚Äì3 record in those matchups, but with conference realignment and the West Coast Conference's additions of BYU (2011) and Pacific (2013), the Zags have been more selective and limited in their scheduling with four less matchups in their non-conference schedule, so they have only played in the Spokane Arena once since 2012. It also hosted the WIAA Class B state high school basketball tournament annually until 2006. The tournament came back to the arena in 2007, but as the Class 2B tournament. The WIAA had split the B classification into 1B and 2B. The Yakima SunDome in Yakima hosts the 1B tournament. The Class 1B tournament returned in 2011 when the WIAA changed the state tournament format. Notably, this was the reason why the West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Tournament had never been in Spokane before 2006; the Class B and WCC tournaments clash every year, and Gonzaga's on-campus arena at that time, the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, was too small to host the WCC tournament (it seated only 4,000 people). In 2004, Gonzaga opened a new on-campus arena, the McCarthey Athletic Center, which enabled it to enter the WCC tournament rotation. The conference has since moved its tournament to the neutral Orleans Arena in Las Vegas. = NCAA Division I tournaments = Spokane Arena has been the site of several NCAA Division I basketball tournament games (men and women), with Washington State University as the designated host school. For the men, the arena hosted in the opening rounds in 2003, 2007, 2010, 2014, and 2016, hosted by the University of Idaho for the first time. Prior to the arena's opening, the NCAA tournament was held in the region on the WSU campus in Pullman at Beasley Coliseum (1975, 1982, 1984). The arena was a women's regional site in 2008, 2011, and 2015. The 2011 regional was notable as Gonzaga became the lowest-seeded team ever to make a regional final in the women's tournament. Bull riding In 1999, the PBR made a stop in Spokane Arena for a Bud Light Cup Series event; it was one of six wins for Cody Hart in 1999, the same year he became a PBR World Champion. Figure skating In January 2007, the Spokane Arena was put in the national spotlight once again. It was one of two facilities to host the 2007 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, the other being the Group Health Exhibit Hall at the Spokane Center several blocks away. The arena, as well as the city received many rave reviews and also shattered the previous attendance record for the event, previously held by Los Angeles, California, by over 30,000 attendees. On May 5, 2008, it was announced that Spokane would once again host the U.S. Figure Skating Championships leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Spokane Arena was the sole venue for the 2010 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. The Spokane Arena successfully hosted the 2010 US Figure Skating Championships from January 15‚Äì24, 2010 and broke its own attendance record with 158,170 tickets sold during the 10-day event. Also, the Spokane Arena hosted the very first 2016 Team Challenge Cup, where athletes from North America, Europe, and Asia, competed against each other in teams. Team North America won the event. =Football= The Spokane Shock of the af2 and the Arena Football League played at the arena from 2006 until 2015. The Shock hosted ArenaBowl XXIII in 2010. The Shock then attempted to join the Indoor Football League in 2015 but the AFL withheld the franchise rights from the ownership. The owners then created the Spokane Empire and played in the IFL in 2016 and 2017 before ceasing operations. =Ice hockey= The Spokane Chiefs of the WHL play their home games at the arena. =Concerts at Star Theatre= The Star Theatre is a 5,900-seat theater configuration used for theater concerts, Broadway, family shows and other events. The seating capacity of the configuration positions the \\"venue\\" between the seating capacities of the nearby First Interstate Center for the Arts and the full-theater seating configuration of the Spokane Arena. =Other events= Numerous other activities have taken place at the Spokane Arena including circuses, large conferences, monster truck shows, concerts and much more. And every year the arena is home to Spokane's band and strings spectacular featuring the areas band and strings groups grades 5-6 from all schools. Over the years the venue has hosted a variety of professional wrestling shows. =Notable events hosted= *Gonzaga and Washington State played the first collegiate basketball game on November 24, 1995.

It grows rapidly, but has a short lifespan, between 40 and 75 years. The shoots are yellowish-brown, with small buds. The leaves are alternate and spirally arranged, narrow, light green, 4‚Äì16 cm long and 0.5‚Äì2 cm broad, with finely serrate margins and long acuminate tips; they turn a gold-yellow in autumn. The flowers are arranged in catkins produced early in the spring; it is dioecious, with the male and female catkins on separate trees.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . File:Saule pleureur chaton.jpgMale flowers of Salix babylonica Image:Willow Salix babylonica.jpgPendulous branchlets of Salix babylonica File:Salix babylonica2.jpgBark of Salix babylonica File:SalixBabylonicaLeaf.jpgLeaves of Salix babylonica  Taxonomy  Salix babylonica was described and named scientifically by Carolus Linnaeus in 1736, who knew the species as the pendulous-branched (\\"weeping\\") variant then recently introduced into the Clifford garden in Hartekamp in The Netherlands. = Horticultural selections and related hybrids = Hybrid weeping willows (Salix √ó sepulcralis 'Chrysocoma') in December, with pendulous yellow branchlets (Central Park) Early Chinese cultivar selections include the original weeping willow, Salix babylonica 'Pendula', in which the branches and twigs are strongly pendulous, which was presumably spread along ancient trade routes. These distinctive trees were subsequently introduced into England from Aleppo in northern Syria in 1730, and have rapidly become naturalised, growing well along rivers and in parks. These plants are all females, readily propagated vegetatively, and capable of hybridizing with various other kinds of willows, but not breeding true from seed. This type of tree is grown very easily through plant propagation. Two cultivated hybrids between pendulous Salix babylonica and other species of Salix willows also have pendulous branchlets, and are more commonly planted than S. babylonica itself: * Salix √ó pendulina, a hybrid with S. babylonica accepted as the female parent, but with the male parent unidentified, probably being either S. euxina or S. √ó fragilis, but perhaps S. pentandra. Of these possibilities, S. √ó fragilis is itself a hybrid, with S. alba and S. euxina as parental species. * Salix √ó sepulcralis, is a hybrid between S. alba and S. babylonica. Cultivars derived from either of these hybrids are generally better adapted than S. babylonica to the more humid climates of most heavily populated regions of Europe and North America. =Relation to Salix matsudana= A similar willow species also native to northern China, Salix matsudana (Chinese willow), is now included in Salix babylonica as a synonym by many botanists, including the Russian willow expert Alexey Skvortsov. The only reported difference between the two species is S. matsudana has two nectaries in each female flower, whereas S. babylonica has only one; however, this character is variable in many willows (for example, crack willow, Salix fragilis, can have either one or two), so even this difference may not be taxonomically significant.Bean, W. J. (1980). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles 8th ed., vol. 6. John Murray . A horticultural variant with twisted twigs and trunk, the corkscrew willow (S. matsudana var. tortuosa), is widely planted.  Cultivation  Weeping Willow, by Claude Monet (1918) S. babylonica, especially its pendulous-branched (\\"weeping\\") form, has been introduced into many other areas, including Europe and the southeastern United States, but beyond China, it has not generally been as successfully cultivated as some of its hybrid derivatives, being sensitive to late-spring frosts. In the more humid climates of much of Europe and eastern North America, it is susceptible to a canker disease, willow anthracnose (Marssonina salicicola), which makes infected trees very short- lived and unsightly.Meikle, R. D. (1984). Willows and Poplars of Great Britain and Ireland. BSBI Handbook No. 4. . = Cultivars = Salix babylonica (Babylon willow) has many cultivars, including: * 'Babylon' (synonym: 'Napoleon') is the most widely grown cultivar of S. babylonica, with its typical weeping branches.Santamour, F.S. & McArdle, A.J. (1988). Cultivars of Salix babylonica and other Weeping Willows. Journal of Arboriculture 14: 180-184 * 'Crispa' (synonym: 'Annularis') is a mutant of 'Babylon', with spirally curled leaves. Various cultivars of Salix matsudana (Chinese willow) are now often included within Salix babylonica, treated more broadly, including: * 'Pendula' is one of the best weeping trees, with a silvery shine, hardier, and more disease resistant. * 'Tortuosa' is an upright tree with twisted and contorted branches, marketed as corkscrew willow. Yet other weeping willow cultivars are derived from interspecific Salix hybrids, including S. babylonica in their parentage. The most widely grown weeping willow cultivar is Salix √ó sepulcralis 'Chrysocoma', with bright yellowish branchlets.  Uses  Peking willow is a popular ornamental tree in northern China, and is also grown for wood production and shelterbelts there, being particularly important around the oases of the Gobi Desert, protecting agricultural land from desert winds. Origin: China, not Babylon The epithet babylonica in this Chinese species' scientific name (S. babylonica), as well as the related common names \\"Babylon willow\\" or \\"Babylon weeping willow\\", derive from a misunderstanding by Linnaeus that this willow was the tree described in the Bible in the opening of Psalm 137 (here in Latin and English translations): * From the Clementine Vulgate (Latin, 1592): :: > Super flumina Babylonis illic sedimus et flevimus, cum recordaremur Sion. > :::In salicibus in medio ejus suspendimus organa nostra.... :Here, \\"salicibus\\" is the dative plural of the Latin noun salix, the willows, used by Linnaeus as the name for the willow genus Salix. * From the King James Version (English, 1611): :: > By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we > remembered Zion. :::We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst > thereof. * From the Revised Standard Version (English, 1952): :: > By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered > Zion :::On the willows there we hung up our lyres.... Despite these Biblical references to \\"willows\\", whether in Latin or English, the trees growing in Babylon along the Euphrates River in ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and named gharab in early Hebrew, are not willows (Salix) in either the modern or the classical sense, but the Euphrates poplar (Populus euphratica), with willow-like leaves on long, drooping shoots, in the related genus Populus. Both Populus and Salix are in the plant family Salicaceae, the willow family. These Babylonian trees are correctly called poplars, not willows, in the New International Version of the Bible (English, 1978): :: > By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion :::There on > the poplars we hung our harps.

It is published as The Gold Coast Bulletin on weekdays and the Weekend Bulletin at weekends. It is owned by News Corp Australia.  History  The newspaper has undergone a number of masthead and ownership changes. When Patrick Joseph McNamara started the paper in 1885, he worked in a tin shed on Southport's Lawson Street. He named the paper The Southern Queensland Bulletin, and it was the first newspaper published in Southport. McNamara was succeeded by Mr Shepherd and Mr Mellor. In the 1890s, the broadsheet was renamed to The Logan and Albert Bulletin, and kept this name until 1928. It was during this period that the Rootes family became associated with the paper, a relationship that spanned generations and provided stability to the publication. Front page of The South Coast Bulletin, 25 January 1929 In 1908 Mr Edward Fass purchased the newspaper and sold his interest in 1928. On 21 December 1928, under the editorship of Mr Michael James O'Donohue, the newspaper changed format to a tabloid and altered its masthead to The South Coast Bulletin. The first issue with this title was published on 21 December 1928. In 1930 a new editor, Mr Norman Sydney Woodroffe, was appointed. During the 1930s The South Coast Bulletin was published weekly on a Friday. It focused on local issues and was \\"strongly involved in promoting the South Coast as a holiday resort\\". It included information on pioneers of the region, reported on items of interest to local residents and advocated for the improvement of the steadily growing region now known as the Gold Coast, Queensland. National Library of Australia is partially digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program. The South Coast Bulletin became the Gold Coast Bulletin in 1963.

He is best known, outside blues circles, for his songs \\"That's All Right\\" (1946), \\"My Baby Left Me\\" and \\"So Glad You're Mine\\", later recorded by Elvis Presley and other artists. Early life Crudup was born in Forest, Mississippi, to a family of migrant workers traveling through the South and Midwest. The family returned to Mississippi in 1926, where he sang gospel music. He had lessons with a local bluesman, whose name was Papa Harvey, and later he was able to play in dance halls and cafes around Forest. Around 1940 he went to Chicago.Arthur Crudup , Biography.com. Retrieved 29 January 2018 Musical career He began his career as a blues singer around Clarksdale, Mississippi. As a member of the Harmonizing Four, he visited Chicago in 1939. He stayed in Chicago to work as a solo musician but barely made a living as a street singer. The record producer Lester Melrose allegedly found him while Crudup was living in a packing crate, introduced him to Hudson Whittaker, better known as Tampa Red, and signed him to a recording contract with RCA Victor's Bluebird label. =Recordings= He recorded with RCA in the late 1940s and with Ace Records, Checker Records and Trumpet Records in the early 1950s. He toured black clubs in the South, sometimes playing with Sonny Boy Williamson II and Elmore James.Groom, Bob (1993). Arthur \\"Big Boy\\" Crudup, Complete Recorded Works, vol. 3 (11 March 1949 to 15 January 1952). Document Records DOCD-5203. He also recorded under the names Elmer James and Percy Lee Crudup. His songs \\"Mean Old 'Frisco Blues\\", \\"Who's Been Foolin' You\\" and \\"That's All Right\\" were popular in the South. These and his other songs \\"Rock Me Mama\\", \\"So Glad You're Mine\\", and \\"My Baby Left Me\\" have been recorded by many artists, including Elvis Presley, Slade, Elton John and Rod Stewart.Szatmary, David (2014). Rockin' in Time. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson. Crudup stopped recording in the 1950s because of disputes over royalties. He said, \\"I realised I was making everybody rich, and here I was poor\\". His last Chicago session was in 1951. His 1952‚Äì54 recording sessions for Victor were held at radio station WGST, in Atlanta, Georgia. He returned to recording, for Fire Records and Delmark Records, and touring in 1965. Sometimes labeled \\"The Father of Rock and Roll\\", he accepted this title with some bemusement. During this time Crudup worked as a laborer to augment the low wages he received as a singer (he was not receiving royalties). After a dispute with Melrose over royalties, he returned to Mississippi and took up bootlegging. He later moved to Virginia, where he lived with his family, including three sons and several of his siblings, and worked as a field laborer. He occasionally sang in and supplied moonshine to drinking establishments, including one called the Do Drop Inn, in Franktown, Northampton County. =Later years= Franktown, Virginia In 1968, the blues promoter Dick Waterman began fighting for Crudup's royalties and reached an agreement in which Crudup would be paid $60,000. However, Hill and Range Songs, from which he was supposed to get the royalties, refused to sign the legal papers at the last minute, because the company thought it could not lose more money in legal action. In the early 1970s, two Virginia activists, Celia Santiago and Margaret Carter, assisted Crudup in an attempt to gain royalties he felt he was due, with little success. By 1971, he had collected over $10,000 in overdue royalties through the intervention of the Songwriters Guild of America (then called the American Guild Of Authors And Composers).\\"AGAC goes to bat for exploited blues vets\\". Downbeat magazine (November 11, 1971), p. 8 On a 1970 trip to the United Kingdom, Crudup recorded \\"Roebuck Man\\" with local musicians. His last professional engagements were with Bonnie Raitt. Death Crudup died in 1974, four years after the failed royalty settlement. There was some confusion about the date of death because of his use of several names, including those of his siblings. He died of complications of heart disease and diabetes in the Nassawadox hospital in Northampton County, Virginia, in March 1974. Legacy Crudup has been honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail, placed at Forest.

Jakov immediately joined the Serbian rebels, and after the victory in Svileuva (1804) he became one of the most distinguished commanders and persons of western Serbia. He acquired his ammunitions and weapons from Syrmia, then part of Austria. In March 1804, he attacked ≈†abac.

The party achieved some political expression in the last years of the fascist regime of Marcello Caetano, mainly in Paris, among a community of exiled politicians.

It was one of the half-dozen self-ruling princely abbeys of the Holy Roman Empire from the late Middle Ages until 1792 when Corvey was elevated to a prince-bishopric. Corvey, whose territory extended over a vast area, was in turn secularized in 1803 in the course of the German mediatisation and absorbed into the newly created Principality of Nassau- Orange-Fulda. In 2014, the former abbey church was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Territory of the Princely Abbey of Corvey in the 18th century History of the abbey =Foundation and early years= In the Saxon Wars which lasted more than thirty years after 772, Charlemagne, king of the Franks, was eventually victorious, adding the Saxon territory to his empire and starting the Christianisation of the Saxon people. To that end, bishoprics were established (at Hildesheim and Halberstadt). In addition, the idea of setting up an abbey in Saxony was first mooted during Charlemagne's reign. However, the plan was only implemented under his son, Emperor Louis the Pious, who announced the creation of an abbey east of the river Weser at a synod in Paderborn in 815. This was located at a place named Hethis. Although there is some uncertainty over the exact location,The site, Hethis, is not securely identifiable (Hethis, noting Herbert Kr√ºger, \\"Wo lag Hethis, der Ort der ersten Corveyer Klostergr√ºndung?\\", Mannus 24, Leipzig, (1932:320‚Äî32)). it is today thought to be near . The first monks arrived in 816 from the Benedictine abbey from Corbie Abbey in Picardy. They set up a Probstei, a subsidiary of the motherhouse. Due to the inappropriate location chosen, the monks chose to move in 822 - to the current location near what was then called Villa Huxori. The new house became known as Nova Corbeia (Latin for the \\"new Corbie\\"; Old German: Corvey ). The first abbot of Corvey was a cousin of Charlemagne, Adalard of Corbie. Ansgar, who later became the \\"Apostle of Scandinavia\\", founded the abbey school in 823. The abbey library was established with works from Corbie, augmented by the output of the local scriptorium. In 826, Corvey became an independent abbey, dedicated to Saint Stephen. In 833, it was granted the right of coinage within the Franconian realm, as the first place east of the Rhine. In 836, the remains of Saint Vitus were gifted to Corvey by the abbey of St Denis near Paris. Saint Vitus now became the patron saint of the Saxons. Since he was also one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, his veneration was very popular in the Middle Ages and Corvey became a destination for pilgrims. Other gifts and donations by individuals made Corvey one of the richest abbeys in Central Europe and made possible ambitious building projects. Its position as Reichsabtei meant that its abbot was answerable directly to the emperor in secular matters. The first stone church was consecrated in 844. In 873-885, the Westwerk that is still extant today was constructed. Corvey thus became \\"one of the most privileged Carolingian monastic sanctuaries in the 9th-century Duchy of Saxony\\".Leyser, Karl. \\"Ottonian Government\\" The English Historical Review 96, No. 381 (October, 1981), p. 735. It soon became famous for its school, which produced many celebrated scholars, among them the 10th-century Saxon historian Widukind of Corvey, author of Res gestae Saxonicae. From its cloisters went forth a stream of missionaries who evangelised Northern Europe. The site of the abbey, where the east-west route called the Hellweg crossed the Weser, was of some strategic importance and assured its economic and cultural importance. The abbey's historian H. H. Kaminsky estimates that the royal entourage visited Corvey at least 110 times before 1073, occasions for the issuance of charters. =Imperial rights granted= A diploma granted by Otto I in 940, the first of its kind, established the abbot, Folcmar, on a new kind of setting. The abbot was granted bannus‚Äîpowers of enforcement‚Äîover the population of peasants that were to seek refuge in the fortress built in the monastery's lands; in return they were expected to maintain its structure, under the abbot's supervision. The workforce under monastic protection was drawn from three pagi, under the jurisdiction of four counts, who, however, were to have no rights to demand castlework from them.Leyser, Karl. \\"Henry I and the Beginnings of the Saxon Empire\\", The English Historical Review 83, No. 326 (Jan., 1968), p.9 Initial page of the \\"Wernigerode Gospels\\". A 10th-century book illumination from the scriptorium of Corvey Abbey. =Strife and decline= In the Investiture Controversy, the abbot of Corvey took a stand with the Saxon nobles against Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Its abbot Markward (served 1081‚Äì1107), \\"without doubt one of the most important abbots of the thousand-year history of the abbey\\" (Kaminsky), and his successor Erkenbert (1107‚Äì28) saw the abbey through the critical period. The abbey also participated in attempts to reform the Catholic Church during the 11th century. It was the dominant theological centre in the region and established numerous subsidiary abbeys. A final period of prosperity followed under the leadership of Wibald (abbot from 1146‚Äì58). At that time, the Westwerk was reconstructed in the High Romanesque style, and the Carolingian three-tower set-up was replaced with twin towers. By the mid-12th century, a substantial town (also named Corvey) had grown up around the abbey. In 1265, the neighbouring town of H√∂xter, jealous of its nearby rival and its Weser bridge, allied itself with the Bishop of Paderborn and their troops destroyed the town of Corvey and damaged the abbey. The town never recovered and over the following decades reverted to a small village. This event marked the beginning of the long period of decline of the abbey. The Reformation threatened Corvey as it did the other ecclesiastical territories in north-west Germany but the princely abbey did survive somewhat precariously as a self-ruling principality at the border of Protestant Brunswick and Hesse-Kassel. From the mid-16th century onward, the prince-abbot and his monks ran the administration in cooperation with a partly Protestant assembly consisting of three noble families, one town (H√∂xter) and a prelate. The prince-abbot, who had seat and vote in the Reichstag as a member of the College of Ruling Princes, took only a modest part in imperial affairs, while the home affairs of the abbey were limited to little more than gentry-like estate management.G. Benecke, Society and Politics in Germany 1500-1750, Routledge and Kegan Paul, London 1974, pp.102-103. In 1634, during the Thirty Years War the abbey building was sacked by imperial troops who also laid siege to H√∂xter. It was later demolished. Only the Westwerk remained. =Reconstruction= It took decades for the local area to recover from the devastation of the war. After Christoph Bernhard von Galen, Bishop of M√ºnster became prince and administrator of the abbey in 1665, reconstruction began. The Carolingian church was replaced by a Gothic building, with the exception of the Westwerk. Under von Galen's successors Christoph von Bellinghausen (1678‚Äì96), Florenz von der Felde (1696-1714) and Maximilian von Horrich (1714‚Äì22) the other substantial Baroque buildings still there today were erected. Prince-Bishopric of Corvey In 1792, Corvey ceased to be a Benedictine abbey and was raised by pope Pius VI to the status of a prince- bishopric. (abbot/bishop 1776-94) and (bishop 1794-1825) were the last ecclesial princes at Corvey. In 1803, the Prince-Bishopric of Corvey was secularized under Napoleonic administration and became briefly part of the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda. In 1807, it went to J√©r√¥me Bonaparte's Kingdom of Westphalia. After the Congress of Vienna, Corvey fell to the Prussia in 1815. As compensation for lost territory west of the Rhine, it was awarded to Victor Amadeus, the Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg, in 1820. While Corvey had ceased to exist as a political state in 1803, it continued to exist as a diocese until 1825. Schloss Corvey The Kaisersaal of Corvey Abbey Schloss Corvey View from North 2017-12-28 Landgrave Victor Amadeus rebuilt the abbey buildings as a Schloss (palace). In 1834, the property fell to Victor von Hohenlohe-Schillingf√ºrst, a member of the House of Hohenlohe. In 1840, he was granted the title Herzog von Ratibor und F√ºrst von Corvey (Duke of Ratibor and Prince of Corvey) by King Frederick William IV of Prussia. Since then, Schloss Corvey has remained property of the family. Library The famous abbey library has long since been dispersed, but the \\"princely library\\" (F√ºrstliche Bibliothek), an aristocratic family library, containing about 74,000 volumes, mainly in German, French, and English, with a tailing off circa 1834, survives in the Schloss. One striking feature of the collection is the large number of English Romantic novels, some in unique copies, for in Britain fiction was more often borrowed than bought, and was read extensively in the lending libraries.The library has been discussed as a cultural marker in the record of a symposium at Corvey, Rainer Sch√∂werling, Hartmut Steinecke and Norbert Otto Eke, Die F√ºrstliche Bibliothek Corvey: ihre Bedeutung f√ºr eine neue Sicht der Literatur des fr√ºhen 19. Jahrhunderts,1992, and Werner Huber and Rainer Sch√∂werling, The Corvey Library and Anglo-German cultural exchanges, 1770-1837, 2004. The poet and author of the Deutschlandlied, August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, worked here as librarian from 1860 until his death in 1874. He is buried in the church graveyard. World Heritage Site The abbey complex became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June 2014. The site is delimited by the extent of the original Carolingian monastery, of which only the westwork remains standing today. Today The Carolingian Westwerk (west front) of the abbey, with its landmark matching towers survives, the earliest standing medieval structure in Westphalia, but most of the abbey church is now Baroque. The present owner of the palace is Viktor, 5th Duke of Ratibor and 5th Prince of Corvey, Prince of Hohenlohe- Schillingsf√ºrst-Metternich-S√°ndor (b. 1964). Schloss, library and church are today open to the public.

It includes three genera, Amblyceps, Liobagrus, and Xiurenbagrus, and about 36 species. Taxonomy The family Amblycipitidae is a monophyletic group containing four monophyletic genera, Amblyceps, Liobagrus, Nahangbagrus and Xiurenbagrus. It is the most basal sisoroid family and is sister to a clade formed by the remaining families. The genera Amblyceps and Liobagrus are a sister group pair that is, in turn, sister to Xiurenbagrus. Distribution and habitat These kinds of fishes can be found in swift freshwater streams in southern and eastern Asia, including Pakistan across northern India to Malaysia, China, Korea, and Japan. Amblyceps are mainly distributed in India and the Malay Peninsula. Liobagrus fishes are distributed in the Yangtze River basin, Taiwan, Japan, and the Korea Peninsula. The species of the genus Xiurenbagrus are only distributed in the Pearl River basin. Description Fish of this family have dorsal fins covered by skin. An adipose fin is also present, and is fused with the caudal fin in some species. The dorsal fin base is short and the dorsal fin spine is weak. The anal fin base is short. There are four pairs of barbels. The lateral line is poorly developed or absent. Both Amblyceps and Liobagrus species grow to about SL. Liobagrus is more stoutly built than Amblyceps, the nostrils are close together in Amblyceps and distinctly apart in Liobagrus, and Amblyceps species have a cup-like flap above the pectoral fins that is absent in Liobagrus. Also, Amblyceps has double-folded lips and fin margins pigmented differently from the background colour, while Liobagrus has single-folded lips and fin margins paler than the background colour.

They evolved from the wooden stockades of earlier centuries, and came into their best-known form in the 16th century. Castles in Japan were built to guard important or strategic sites, such as ports, river crossings, or crossroads, and almost always incorporated the landscape into their defenses. Though they were built to last and used more stone in their construction than most Japanese buildings, castles were still constructed primarily of wood, and many were destroyed over the years. This was especially true during the Sengoku period (1467‚Äì1603), when many of these castles were first built. However, many were rebuilt, either later in the Sengoku period, in the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867) that followed, or more recently, as national heritage sites or museums. Today there are more than one hundred castles extant, or partially extant, in Japan; it is estimated that once there were five thousand. Some castles, such as the ones at Matsue and K≈çchi, both built in 1611, remain extant in their original forms, not having suffered any damage from sieges or other threats. Hiroshima Castle, on the opposite end of the spectrum, was destroyed in the atomic bombing, and was rebuilt in 1958 as a museum. The character for castle, 'Âüé', by itself read as shiro (its kun'yomi), is read as j≈ç (the Chinese-derived on'yomi) when attached to a word, such as in the name of a particular castle. Thus, for example, Osaka Castle is called ≈åsaka-j≈ç (Â§ßÈò™Âüé) in Japanese. History Tsuyama Castle was a typical hilltop castle. Originally conceived as fortresses for military defense, Japanese castles were placed in strategic locations, typically along trade routes, roads, and rivers. Though castles continued to be built with these considerations, for centuries, fortresses were also built as centres of governance. By the Sengoku period, they had come to serve as the homes of daimy≈çs (feudal lords), to impress and to intimidate rivals not only with their defences but also with their sizes, architecture, and elegant interiors. In 1576, Oda Nobunaga was among the first to build one of these palace-like castles: Azuchi Castle was Japan's first castle to have a tower keep (Â§©ÂÆàÈñ£, tenshukaku), and it inspired both Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Osaka Castle and Tokugawa Ieyasu's Edo Castle. Azuchi served as the governing center of Oda's territories, and as his lavish home, but it was also very keenly and strategically placed. A short distance away from the capital of Kyoto, which had long been a target of violence, Azuchi's carefully chosen location allowed it a great degree of control over the transportation and communication routes of Oda's enemies. Before the Sengoku period (roughly the 16th century), most castles were called . Though most later castles were built atop mountains or hills, these were built from the mountains. Trees and other foliage were cleared, and the stone and dirt of the mountain itself was carved into rough fortifications. Ditches were dug, to present obstacles to attackers, as well as to allow boulders to be rolled down at attackers. Moats were created by diverting mountain streams. Buildings were made primarily of wattle and daub, using thatched roofs, or, occasionally, wooden shingles. Small ports in the walls or planks could be used to deploy bows or fire guns from. The main weakness of this style was its general instability. Thatch caught fire even more easily than wood, and weather and soil erosion prevented structures from being particularly large or heavy. Eventually, stone bases began to be used, encasing the hilltop in a layer of fine pebbles, and then a layer of larger rocks over that, with no mortar. This support allowed larger, heavier, and more permanent buildings. =Early fortifications= The reconstructed western gate of Ki castle. The first fortifications in Japan were hardly what one generally associates with the term \\"castles\\". Made primarily of earthworks, or rammed earth, and wood, the earliest fortifications made far greater use of natural defences and topography than anything man-made. These k≈çgoishi and chashi („ÉÅ„É£„Ç∑, for Ainu castles) were never intended to be long-term defensive positions, let alone residences; the native peoples of the archipelago built fortifications when they were needed and abandoned the sites afterwards. The Yamato people began to build cities in earnest in the 7th century, complete with expansive palace complexes, surrounded on four sides with walls and impressive gates. Earthworks and wooden fortresses were also built throughout the countryside to defend the territory from the native Emishi, Ainu and other groups; unlike their primitive predecessors, these were relatively permanent structures, built in peacetime. These were largely built as extensions of natural features, and often consisted of little more than earthworks and wooden barricades. The Nara period (c. 710‚Äì794) fortress at Dazaifu, from which all of Ky≈´sh≈´ would be governed and defended for centuries afterwards, was originally constructed in this manner, and remnants can still be seen today. A bulwark was constructed around the fortress to serve as a moat to aid in the defense of the structure; in accordance with military strategies and philosophies of the time, it would only be filled with water at times of conflict. This was called a mizuki (), or \\"water fort\\". The character for castle or fortress (), up until sometime in the 9th century or later, was read (pronounced) ki, as in this example, mizuki. Though fairly basic in construction and appearance, these wooden and earthwork structures were designed to impress just as much as to function effectively against attack. Chinese and Korean architecture influenced the design of Japanese buildings, including fortifications, in this period. The remains or ruins of some of these fortresses, decidedly different from what would come later, can still be seen in certain parts of Ky≈´sh≈´ and T≈çhoku today. =Medieval period= The Heian period (794‚Äì1185) saw a shift from the need to defend the entire state from invaders to that of lords defending individual mansions or territories from one another. Though battles were still continually fought in the north- east portion of Honsh≈´ (the T≈çhoku region) against native peoples, the rise of the samurai warrior classThe term samurai, deriving from saburai (\\"one who serves\\"), refers both to the armed feudal retainers who fought for their lords in feudal Japan, but also to the noble warrior class as a whole. Thus, unlike the European knight, the samurai was a samurai by virtue of his birth, retaining this status regardless of his rank. The samurai bore close ties to his clan (the noble family of his lineage), and to other clans to which his own owed fealty, serving loyally in the defence of his lord's lands, in attacks of enemy lands, or in a great number of other ways. For more on the role of the samurai class and its development over time, see samurai. towards the end of the period, and various disputes between noble families jostling for power and influence in the Imperial Court brought about further upgrades. The primary defensive concern in the archipelago was no longer native tribes or foreign invaders, but rather internal conflicts within Japan, between rival samurai clans or other increasingly large and powerful factions, and as a result, defensive strategies and attitudes were forced to change and adapt. As factions emerged and loyalties shifted, clans and factions that had helped the Imperial Court became enemies, and defensive networks were broken, or altered through the shifting of alliances. The Genpei War (1180‚Äì1185) between the Minamoto and Taira clans, and the Nanboku-ch≈ç Wars (1336‚Äì1392) between the Northern and Southern Imperial Courts are the primary conflicts that define these developments during what is sometimes called Japan's medieval period. Fortifications were still made almost entirely out of wood, and were based largely on earlier modes, and on Chinese and Korean examples. But they began to become larger, to incorporate more buildings, to accommodate larger armies, and to be conceived as more long-lasting structures. This mode of fortification, developed gradually from earlier modes and used throughout the wars of the Heian period (770‚Äì1185), and deployed to help defend the shores of Ky≈´sh≈´ from the Mongol invasions of the 13th century,The only invasion attempts upon Japan in the 2nd millennium, these had a not insignificant impact upon defences in and around Hakata, where the Mongols landed, but are exceptions to the trend of internal warfare which guided military developments in pre-modern Japan. reached its climax in the 1330s, during the Nanboku-ch≈ç period. Chihaya Castle and Akasaka castle, permanent castle complexes containing a number of buildings but no tall keep towers, and surrounded by wooden walls, were built by Kusunoki Masashige to be as militarily effective as possible, within the technology and designs of the time. The Ashikaga shogunate, established in the 1330s, had a tenuous grip on the archipelago, and maintained relative peace for over a century. Castle design and organization continued to develop under the Ashikaga shogunate, and throughout the Sengoku period. Castle complexes became fairly elaborate, containing a number of structures, some of which were quite complex internally, as they now served as residences, command centres, and a number of other purposes. Sengoku The ≈ånin War, which broke out in 1467, marked the beginning of 147 years of widespread warfare (called the Sengoku period) between daimy≈çs (feudal lords) across the entire archipelago. For the duration of the ≈ånin War (1467‚Äì1477), and into the Sengoku period, the entire city of Kyoto became a battlefield, and suffered extensive damage. Noble family mansions across the city became increasingly fortified over this ten-year period, and attempts were made to isolate the city as a whole from the marauding armies of samurai that dominated the landscape for over a century.Sansom (1961), pp.223‚Äì227. As regional officials and others became the daimy≈çs, and the country descended into war, they began to quickly add to their power bases, securing their primary residences, and constructing additional fortifications in tactically advantageous or important locations. Originally conceived as purely defensive (martial) structures, or as retirement bunkers where a lord could safely ride out periods of violence in his lands, over the course of the Sengoku period, many of these mountain castles developed into permanent residences, with elaborate exteriors and lavish interiors. The beginnings of the shapes and styles now considered to be the \\"classic\\" Japanese castle design emerged at this time, and castle towns (j≈çkamachi, \\"town below castle\\") also appeared and developed. Despite these developments, though, for most of the Sengoku period castles remained essentially larger, more complex versions of the simple wooden fortifications of centuries earlier. It was not until the last thirty years of the period of war that drastic changes would occur to bring about the emergence of the type of castle typified by Himeji Castle and other surviving castles. This period of war culminated in the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period, the scene of numerous fierce battles, which saw the introduction of firearms and the development of tactics to employ or counter them. =Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period= Nagoya Castle Unlike in Europe, where the advent of the cannon spelled the end of the age of castles, Japanese castle-building was spurred, ironically, by the introduction of firearms. Though firearms first appeared in Japan in 1543, and castle design almost immediately saw developments in reaction, Azuchi castle, built in the 1570s, was the first example of a largely new type of castle, on a larger, grander scale than those that came before, boasting a large stone base (, musha-gaeshi), a complex arrangement of concentric baileys (, maru), and a tall central tower. In addition, the castle was located on a plain, rather than on a densely forested mountain, and relied more heavily on architecture and manmade defenses than on its natural environment for protection. These features, along with the general appearance and organization of the Japanese castle, which had matured by this point, have come to define the stereotypical Japanese castle. Along with Hideyoshi's Fushimi‚ÄìMomoyama castle, Azuchi lends its name to the brief Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period (roughly 1568‚Äì1600) in which these types of castles, used for military defense, flourished. Osaka Castle Osaka Castle was destroyed by cannon. This reproduction towers above the surroundings. The introduction of the arquebus brought dramatic shifts in battle tactics and military attitudes in Japan. Though these shifts were complex and numerous, one of the concepts key to changes in castle design at this time was that of battle at range. Though archery duels had traditionally preceded samurai battles since the Heian period or earlier, exchanges of fire with arquebuses had a far more dramatic effect on the outcome of the battle; hand-to-hand fighting, while still very common, was diminished by the coordinated use of firearms. Oda Nobunaga, one of the most expert commanders in the coordinated tactical use of the new weapon, built his Azuchi castle, which has since come to be seen as the paradigm of the new phase of castle design, with these considerations in mind. The stone foundation resisted damage from arquebus balls better than wood or earthworks, and the overall larger scale of the complex added to the difficulty of destroying it. Tall towers and the castle's location on a plain provided greater visibility from which the garrison could employ their guns, and the complex set of courtyards and baileys provided additional opportunities for defenders to retake portions of the castle that had fallen. Cannon were rare in Japan due to the expense of obtaining them from foreigners, and the difficulty in casting such weapons themselves as the foundries used to make bronze temple bells were simply unsuited to the production of iron or steel cannon. The few cannon that were used were smaller and weaker than those used in European sieges, and many of them were in fact taken from European ships and remounted to serve on land; where the advent of cannon and other artillery brought an end to stone castles in Europe, wooden ones would remain in Japan for several centuries longer. A few castles boasted 'wall guns', but these are presumed to have been little more than large caliber arquebuses, lacking the power of a true cannon. When siege weapons were used in Japan, they were most often trebuchets or catapults in the Chinese style, and they were used as anti-personnel weapons. There is no record that the goal of destroying walls ever entered into the strategy of a Japanese siege. In fact, it was often seen to be more honorable, and more tactically advantageous on the part of the defender for him to lead his forces into battle outside the castle. When battles were not resolved in this way, out in the open, sieges were almost always undertaken purely by denying supplies to the castle, an effort that could last years, but involved little more than surrounding the castle with a force of sufficient size until a surrender could be elicited. The crucial development that spurred the emergence of a new type of defensive architecture was, thus, not cannon, but the advent of firearms. Arquebus firing squads and cavalry charges could overcome wooden stockades with relative ease, and so stone castles came into use. Azuchi Castle was destroyed in 1582, just three years after its completion, but it nevertheless ushered in a new period of castle-building. Among the many castles built in the ensuing years was Hideyoshi's castle at Osaka, completed in 1585. This incorporated all the new features and construction philosophies of Azuchi, and was larger, more prominently located, and longer-lasting. It was the last bastion of resistance against the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate (see Siege of Osaka), and remained prominent if not politically or militarily significant, as the city of Osaka grew up around it, developing into one of Japan's primary commercial centers. Though stone was sometimes used to shore up defenses or foundations for a few centuries prior, Azuchi's distinctive style of stone base was the first of its kind, and was seen in every castle constructed afterwards. The Japanese used cannon very infrequently, and the heavy stone foundations were more than sufficient to repel arquebus fire. Whether intentionally or not, these foundations also proved very resilient against Japan's frequent earthquakes. This period saw the climax of earlier developments towards larger buildings, more complex and concentrated construction, and more elaborate design, both externally and in the castles' interiors. European castle design began to have an impact as well in this period, though the castle had long been in decline in Europe by this point. In Japanese politics and warfare, the castle served not only as a fortress, but as the residence of the daimy≈ç (feudal lord), and as a symbol of his power. Fushimi Castle, which was meant to serve as a luxurious retirement home for Toyotomi Hideyoshi, serves as a popular example of this development. Though it resembled other castles of the period on the outside, the inside was lavishly decorated, and the castle is famous for having a tea room covered in gold leaf. Fushimi was by no means an exception, and many castles bore varying amounts of golden ornamentation on their exteriors. Osaka castle was only one of a number of castles that boasted golden roof tiles, and sculptures of fish, cranes, and tigers. Certainly, outside of such displays of precious metals, the overall aesthetics of the architecture and interiors remained very important, as they do in most aspects of Japanese culture. Some especially powerful families controlled not one, but a whole string of castles, consisting of a main castle (honj≈ç) and a number of satellite castles (shij≈ç) spread throughout their territory. Though the shij≈ç were sometimes full-fledged castles with stone bases, they were more frequently fortresses of wood and earthenworks. Often, a system of fire beacons, drums, or conch shells was set up to enable communications between these castles over a great distance. The H≈çj≈ç family's Odawara Castle and its network of satellites was one of the most powerful examples of this honj≈ç- shij≈ç system; the H≈çj≈ç controlled so much land that a hierarchy of sub- satellite networks was created Korea Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea took place between 1592 and 1598, at the same time as the high point in Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama style castle construction within Japan. Many Japanese castles (called Waj≈ç ÂÄ≠Âüé in Japanese and Waeseong in Korean) were built along the southern shores of Korea. All that remains of these castles today are the stone bases. =Edo period= The Ninomaru Garden at Nij≈ç Castle in Kyoto is attributed to Kobori Ensh≈´. The Sengoku period, roughly a century and a half of war that brought great changes and developments in military tactics and equipment, as well as the emergence of the Azuchi-Momoyama style castle, was followed by the Edo period, over two hundred and fifty years of peace, beginning around 1600‚Äì1615 and ending in 1868. Edo period castles, including survivors from the preceding Azuchi-Momoyama period, therefore no longer had defense against outside forces as their primary purpose. Rather, they served primarily as luxurious homes for the daimy≈çs, their families and retainers, and to protect the daimy≈ç, and his power base, against peasant uprisings and other internal insurrections. The Tokugawa shogunate, to forestall the amassing of power on the part of the daimy≈çs, enforced a number of regulations limiting the number of castles to one per han (feudal domain), with a few exceptions,Satsuma Domain in Ky≈´sh≈´, one of the wealthiest and most powerful domains, doled out sub-fiefs and was allowed by the shogunate to maintain a number of subsidiary castles within their domain; this came largely out of Satsuma's strength and leadership, as well as the inability of the shogunate to effectively enforce many policies in Satsuma.Journal of Asian Studies 16:3 (May 1957), p366‚Äì367. and a number of other policies including that of sankin- k≈çtai. Though there were also, at times, restrictions on the size and furnishings of these castles, and although many daimy≈çs grew quite poor later in the period, daimy≈ç nevertheless sought as much as possible to use their castles as representations of their power and wealth. The general architectural style did not change much from more martial times, but the furnishings and indoor arrangements could be quite lavish. This restriction on the number of castles allowed each han had profound effects not only politically, as intended, but socially, and in terms of the castles themselves. Where members of the samurai class had previously lived in or around the great number of castles sprinkling the landscape, they now became concentrated in the capitals of the han and in Edo; the resulting concentration of samurai in the cities, and their near-total absence from the countryside and from cities that were not feudal capitals (Kyoto and Osaka in particular) were important features of the social and cultural landscape of the Edo period. Meanwhile, the castles in the han capitals inevitably expanded, not only to accommodate the increased number of samurai they now had to support, but also to represent the prestige and power of the daimy≈ç, now consolidated into a single castle. Edo castle, expanded by a factor of twenty between roughly 1600 and 1636 after becoming the shogunal seat. Though obviously something of an exception, the sh≈çgun not being a regular daimy≈ç, it nevertheless serves as a fine example of these developments. These vastly consolidated and expanded castles, and the great number of samurai living, by necessity, in and around them, thus led to an explosion in urban growth in 17th century Japan. As contact with Western powers increased in the middle of the 19th century, some castles such as Gory≈çkaku in Hokkaid≈ç were turned once again to martial purposes. No longer needed to resist samurai cavalry charges, or arquebus squads, attempts were made to convert Gory≈çkaku, and a handful of other castles across the country, into defensible positions against the cannon of Western naval vessels. =Modern period= Matsumoto Castle in Nagano Prefecture, a National Treasure. Meiji Restoration Before the feudal system could be completely overturned, castles played a role in the initial resistance to the Meiji Restoration. In January 1868, the Boshin War broke out in Kyoto, between samurai forces loyal to the disaffected Bakufu government, and allied forces loyal to the new Meiji Emperor, which consisted mainly of samurai and r≈çnin from the Choshu and Satsuma domains.Clements (2010), p.293. By January 31, the Bakufu army had retreated to Osaka Castle in disarray and the sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu had fled to Edo (later Tokyo).Clements (2010), p.294. Osaka Castle was surrendered to the Imperial forces without a fight, and on February 3, 1868, Osaka Castle was burned. The destruction of Osaka Castle, which was a significant symbol of the power of the Shogun in western Japan, dealt a major blow to the prestige of the shogunate and the morale of their troops. From Edo, the Bakufu forces fled north to the Aizu domain, from whence a large number of their troops hailed. As the Aizu Campaign opened, Nagaoka and Komine Castles were the scenes of heavy fighting.Drea (2009), pp.15‚Äì17. In the course of battle, Komine Castle was burned (it was re-built in 1994). The allied forces continued north to the city of Wakamatsu, and lay siege to Tsuruga Castle. After a month, with the walls and main tower pock- marked by bullets and cannonballs, Tsuruga Castle was finally surrendered. It was later demolished and not re-built until 1965. The star shaped fortress of Gory≈çkaku From Aizu, some Bakufu loyalists made their way north to the city of Hakodate, on Hokkaido. There they set up the Republic of Ezo, centered on a government building within the walls of Gory≈çkaku, a French-style star fortress, which is nonetheless often included in lists and in literature on Japanese castles. After the fierce Battle of Hakodate, the fortress of Gory≈çkaku was under siege, and finally surrendered on May 18, 1869, bringing an end to the Boshin War.Clements (2010), pp.295‚Äì296. All castles, along with the feudal domains themselves, were turned over to the Meiji government in the 1871 abolition of the han system. During the Meiji Restoration, these castles were viewed as symbols of the previous ruling elite, and nearly 2,000 castles were dismantled or destroyed. Others were simply abandoned and eventually fell into disrepair. Rebellions continued to break out during the first years of the Meiji period. The last and largest was the Satsuma Rebellion (1877). After heated disagreements in the new Tokyo legislature, young former samurai of the Satsuma domain rashly decided to rebel against the new government, and lobbied Saig≈ç Takamori to lead them. Saigo reluctantly accepted, and led Satsuma forces north from Kagoshima city. Hostilities commenced on February 19, 1877, when the defenders of Kumamoto Castle fired on the Satsuma troops. Fierce hand to hand combat gave way to a siege, but by April 12, reinforcements of the Imperial army arrived to break the siege. After a series of battles, the Satsuma rebels were forced back to Kagoshima city. Fighting continued there, and the stones walls of Kagoshima Castle still show the damage done by bullets. (Kagoshima Castle was never re-built, but portions of the stone walls and the moat were left intact, and later the prefectural history museum was built on the castle's foundation.) The rebel force made their last stand on Shiroyama, or \\"Castle Mountain\\", probably named for a castle built there some time in the past, whose name has been lost in history. During the final battle, Saigo was mortally wounded, and the last forty rebels charged the Imperial troops and were cut down by Gatling guns. The Satsuma Rebellion came to an end at the Battle of \\"Castle Mountain\\" on the morning of September 25, 1877. Imperial Japanese Army Some castles, especially the larger ones, were used by the Imperial Japanese Army. Osaka Castle served as the headquarters for the 4th Infantry Division, until public funds paid for the construction of a new headquarters building within the castle grounds and a short distance from the main tower, so that the castle could be enjoyed by the citizens and visitors of Osaka. Hiroshima Castle served as Imperial General Headquarters during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895) and later as the headquarters for the 5th Infantry Division; Kanazawa Castle served as HQ for the 9th Infantry Division. For this reason, and as a way to strike against the morale and culture of the Japanese people, many castles were intentionally bombed during World War II. The main towers of the castles at Nagoya, Osaka, Okayama, Fukuyama, Wakayama, ≈ågaki, among others, were all destroyed during air raids. Hiroshima Castle is notable for having been destroyed in the atomic bomb blast on August 6, 1945. It was also on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle that news of the atomic bombing was first transmitted to Tokyo. When the atomic bomb detonated, a team of volunteer high school girls had just taken their shift on a radio in a small fortified bunker in the main courtyard of Hiroshima Castle. The girls transmitted the message that the city had been destroyed, to the confused disbelief of the officers receiving the message in Tokyo. Shuri Castle Shuri Castle (actually a Ryukyuan gusuku), on Okinawa Island was not only the headquarters for the 32nd Army and the defense of Okinawa, but also has the distinction of the being the last castle in Japan attacked by an invading force. In April 1945, Shuri Castle was the coordinating point for a line of outposts and defensive positions known as the \\"Shuri Line\\". US Soldiers and Marines encountered fierce resistance and hand- to-hand combat all along the Shuri Line. Starting on May 25, the castle was subjected to three days of intense naval bombardment from the USS Mississippi. On May 28, a company of US Marines took the castle, finding that the intensity of the destruction had prompted the headquarters contingent to abandon the castle and link up with scattered units and continue the defense of the island. On May 30, the US flag was raised over one of the parapets of the castle. Shuri Castle was re-built in 1992, and is now an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Over of the Shuri Castle were burnt down due to an electrical fault on 30 October 2019 at around 2.34 am. Reconstruction and conservation During the early 20th century, a new movement for the preservation of heritage grew. The first law for the preservation of sites of historical or cultural significance was enacted in 1919, and was followed ten years later by the 1929 National Treasure Preservation Law.Enders and Gutschow (1998), pp.12‚Äì13.Robertson (2005), p.39. With the enactment of these laws, local governments had an obligation to prevent any further destruction, and they had some of the funds and resources of the national government to improve on these historically significant sites. By the 1920s, nationalism was on the rise, and a new pride was found in the castles, which became symbols of Japan's warrior traditions.McVeigh (2004), pp.47, 157. With new advances in construction, some of the previously destroyed castles were re-built quickly and cheaply with steel-reinforced concrete, such as the main tower of Osaka Castle, which was first re-built in 1928. While many of the remaining castles in Japan are reconstructions, and most of these are steel-reinforced concrete replicas, there has been a movement toward traditional methods of construction. Kanazawa Castle is a remarkable example of a modern reproduction using a significant degree of traditional construction materials and techniques. Modern construction materials at Kanazawa Castle are minimal, discreet, and are primarily in place to ensure stability, safety concerns, and accessibility. At present, there are local non-profit associations that are attempting to collect funds and donations for the historically accurate re-construction of the main towers at Takamatsu Castle on Shikoku, and Edo Castle in Tokyo. There are only twelve castles that are considered \\"original\\": # Bitch≈´ Matsuyama Castle # Hikone Castle # Himeji Castle # Hirosaki Castle # Inuyama Castle # K≈çchi Castle # Marugame Castle # Maruoka Castle # Matsue Castle # Matsumoto Castle # Matsuyama Castle (Iyo) # Uwajima Castle Most of these are in areas of Japan that were not subjected to the strategic bombing of World War II, such as in Shikoku or in the Japanese Alps. Great care is taken with these structures; open flame and smoking near the castles is usually prohibited, and visitors are usually required to remove their shoes before stepping on the wooden floors (slippers are usually provided). Local legends or ghost stories may also be associated with some of these castles; the most famous is probably the tale of Okiku and the Nine Plates, based on events that occurred at Himeji Castle. Earthen ramparts around the main courtyard at the site of Nirengi Castle At the other end of the spectrum are castles that have been left in ruins, though usually after archaeological surveys and excavations have been done.Clements (2010), p.312. Most of these belong to or are maintained by local municipal governments. Some have been incorporated into public parks, such as the ruins of Kuwana Castle and Matsuzaka Castle in Mie Prefecture, Kunohe Castle (Ninohe, Iwate Prefecture), or Sunpu Castle (Shizuoka City). Others have been left in more natural state, often with a marked hiking trail, such as Azaka Castle, (Matsuzaka, Mie Prefecture), Kame Castle (Inawashiro, Fukushima Prefecture), Kikoe Castle (Kagoshima city), or Kanegasaki Castle (Tsuruga city, Fukui Prefecture). The grounds of some were developed with municipal buildings or schools. In Toba, Mie Prefecture, the city hall and an elementary school were built on the site of Toba Castle. Some castle sites are now in the hands of private landowners, and the area has been developed. Vegetable plots now occupy the site of Kaminogo Castle (Gamag≈çri, Aichi), and a chestnut orchard has been planted on the site of Nishikawa Castle, though in both cases some of the castle-related topography can still be seen, such as the motte or ramparts. Finally there are the castle sites that have not been maintained or developed to any degree, and may have few markings or signs. Historical significance and local interest are too low to warrant additional costs. This includes Nagasawa Castle (Toyokawa, Aichi), Sakyoden Castle (Toyohashi, Aichi), Taka Castle (Matsuzaka, Mie), and Kuniyoshi Castle (Mihama, Fukui Prefecture). Castle sites of this type also include nearly every area marked \\"Castle Mountain\\" ( Shiroyama) on the maps of towns and cities across Japan. Because the castle was small or may have been used for a short time in centuries past, the name of the castle is often lost to history, such as the \\"Shiroyama\\" at Sekigahara, Gifu Prefecture, or the \\"Shiroyama\\" between Lake Sh≈çji and Lake Motosu near Mount Fuji, Yamanashi Prefecture. In such cases, locals might not be aware there ever was a castle, believing that the name of the mountain is \\"just a name\\". Detailed city maps will often have such sites marked. At the site, castle-related landscaping, such as ramparts, partly filled wells, and a leveled hilltop or a series of terraces, will provide evidence of the original layout of the castle. Whether original or reconstructions, numerous castles across Japan serve as history and folk museums, as points of pride for local people, and as tangible structures reflecting Japanese history and heritage. As castles are associated with the martial valor of past warriors, there are often monuments near castle structures or in their parks dedicated to either samurai or soldiers of the Imperial Army who died in war, such as the monument to the 18th Infantry Regiment near the ruins of Yoshida Castle (Toyohashi, Aichi). Castle grounds are often developed into parks for the benefit of the public, and planted with cherry blossom trees, plum blossom trees, and other flowering plants. Hirosaki Castle in Aomori Prefecture and Matsumae Castle in Hokkaido are both famous in their respective regions for their cherry blossom trees. The efforts of dedicated groups, as well as various agencies of the government has been to keep castles as relevant and visible in the lives of the Japanese people, to showcase them to visitors, and thus prevent the neglect of national heritage.Clements (2010), p.313. Architecture and defenses Japanese castles were built in a variety of environments, but all were constructed within variations of a fairly well-defined architectural scheme. Yamajiro (Â±±Âüé), or \\"mountain castles\\" were the most common, and provided the best natural defenses. However, castles built on flat plains (Âπ≥Âüé, hirajiro) and those built on lowlands hills (Âπ≥Â±±Âüé, hirayamajiro) were not uncommon, and a few very isolated castles were even built on small natural or artificial islands in lakes or the sea, or along the shore. The science of building and fortifying castles was known as chikuj≈ç-jutsu ().Durbin, W; The Fighting Arts of the Samurai, article in Black Belt Magazine, March 1990 Vol. 28, No. 3Draeger, Donn F. & Smith, Robert W.; Comprehensive Asian fighting arts Kodansha International, 1980, p84 =Walls and foundations= Foundation of the Hikone Castle The steep stone walls beneath Kumamoto Castle are known as musha-gaeshi (Ê≠¶ËÄÖËøî„Åó, \\"repelling warriors\\"). Japanese castles were almost always built atop a hill or mound, and often an artificial mound would be created for this purpose. This not only aided greatly in the defense of the castle, but also allowed it a greater view over the surrounding land, and made the castle look more impressive and intimidating. In some ways, the use of stone, and the development of the architectural style of the castle, was a natural step up from the wooden stockades of earlier centuries. The hills gave Japanese castles sloping walls, which many argue helped (incidentally) to defend them from Japan's frequent earthquakes. There is some disagreement among scholars as to whether or not these stone bases were easy to scale; some argue that the stones made easy hand- and footholds, while others retort that the bases were steep, and individual stones could be as large as high, making them difficult if not next to impossible to scale. Thus, a number of measures were invented to keep attackers off the walls and to stop them from climbing the castle, including pots of hot sand, gun emplacements, and arrow slits from which defenders could fire at attackers while still enjoying nearly full cover. Spaces in the walls for firing from were called sama; arrow slits were called yasama, gun emplacements tepposama and the rarer, later spaces for cannon were known as taihosama.Ratti, Oscar and Adele Westbrook (1973). Secrets of the Samurai. Edison, NJ: Castle Books. Unlike in European castles, which had walkways built into the walls, in Japanese castles, the walls' timbers would be left sticking inwards, and planks would simply be placed over them to provide a surface for archers or gunners to stand on. This standing space was often called the ishi uchi tana or \\"stone throwing shelf\\". Other tactics to hinder attackers' approaches to the walls included caltrops, bamboo spikes planted into the ground at a diagonal, or the use of felled trees, their branches facing outwards and presenting an obstacle to an approaching army (abatis). Many castles also had trapdoors built into their towers, and some even suspended logs from ropes, to drop on attackers. The An≈ç family from ≈åmi Province were the foremost castle architects in the late 16th century, and were renowned for building the 45-degree stone bases, which began to be used for keeps, gatehouses, and corner towers, not just for the castle mound as a whole. Japanese castles, like their European cousins, featured massive stone walls and large moats. However, walls were restricted to the castle compound itself; they were never extended around a j≈çkamachi (castle town), and only very rarely were built along borders. This comes from Japan's long history of not fearing invasion, and stands in stark contrast to philosophies of defensive architecture in Europe, China, and many other parts of the world.Consider, for example, defenses such as Hadrian's Wall and the Great Wall of China, as well as the city walls built throughout Europe and England across history, by the Romans and for centuries afterwards, along with comparable examples in China and elsewhere. Even within the walls, a very different architectural style and philosophy applied, as compared to the corresponding European examples. A number of tile-roofed buildings, constructed from plaster over skeletons of wooden beams, lay within the walls, and in later castles, some of these structures would be placed atop smaller stone-covered mounds. These wooden structures were surprisingly fireproof, as a result of the plaster used on the walls. Sometimes a small portion of a building would be constructed of stone, providing a space to store and contain gunpowder. Though the area inside the walls could be quite large, it did not encompass fields or peasants' homes, and the vast majority of commoners likewise lived outside the castle walls. Samurai lived almost exclusively within the compound, those of higher rank living closer to the daimy≈ç's central keep. In some larger castles, such as Himeji, a secondary inner moat was constructed between this more central area of residences and the outer section where lower-ranking samurai kept their residences. Only a very few commoners, those directly in the employ and service of the daimy≈ç or his retainers, lived within the walls, and they were often designated portions of the compound to live in, according to their occupation, for purposes of administrative efficiency. Overall, it can be said that castle compounds contained only those structures belonging to the daimy≈ç and his retainers, and those important to the administration of the domain. =Layout= A hanging scroll painting of Himeji Castle, giving some indication of the overall layout of the castle, and the complex arrangement of walls and paths that would present a considerable obstacle to an invading army. The primary method of defense lay in the arrangement of the baileys, called maru (‰∏∏) or . Maru, meaning 'round' or 'circle' in most contexts, here refers to sections of the castle, separated by courtyards. Some castles were arranged in concentric circles, each maru lying within the last, while others lay their maru in a row; most used some combination of these two layouts. Since most Japanese castles were built atop a mountain or hill, the topography of the location determined the layout of the maru. The \\"most central bailey\\", containing the keep, was called honmaru (Êú¨‰∏∏), and the second and third were called ni-no-maru (‰∫å„ÅÆ‰∏∏) and san-no-maru (‰∏â„ÅÆ‰∏∏) respectively. These areas contained the main tower and residence of the daimy≈ç, the storerooms (kura Ëîµ or ÂÄâ), and the living quarters of the garrison. Larger castles would have additional encircling sections, called soto-guruwa or s≈çguruwa.While maru (‰∏∏) most literally translates simply to \\"round\\" or \\"circle\\", kuruwa denotes an area enclosed by earthworks or other walls, and was a term also used to denote the enclosed red-light districts such as the Yoshiwara during the Edo period. As it relates to castles, most castles had three maru, main baileys, which could be called kuruwa; additional areas beyond this would be called sotoguruwa (Â§ñÂªì), or \\"kuruwa that are outside\\". At many castles still standing today in Japan, only the honmaru remains. Nij≈ç Castle in Kyoto is an interesting exception, in that the ni-no-maru still stands, while all that remains of the honmaru is the stone base. Utsunomiya Castle, c. Edo period The arrangement of gates and walls sees one of the key tactical differences in design between the Japanese castle and its European counterpart. A complex system of a great many gates and courtyards leading up to the central keep serves as one of the key defensive elements. This was, particularly in the case of larger or more important castles, very carefully arranged to impede an invading army and to allow fallen outer portions of the compound to be regained with relative ease by the garrisons of the inner portion. The defenses of Himeji castle are an excellent example of this. Since sieges rarely involved the wholesale destruction of walls, castle designers and defenders could anticipate the ways in which an invading army would move through the compound, from one gate to another. As an invading army passed through the outer rings of the Himeji compound, it would find itself directly under windows from which rocks, hot sand, or other things could be dropped,Elison (1991), p.364. and also in a position that made them easy shots for archers in the castle's towers. Gates were often placed at tight corners, forcing a bottleneck effect upon the invading force, or even simply at right angles within a square courtyard. Passageways would often lead to blind alleys, and the layout would often prevent visitors (or invaders) from being able to see ahead to where different passages might lead. All in all, these measures made it impossible to enter a castle and travel straight to the keep. Invading armies, as well as, presumably, anyone else entering the castle, would be forced to travel around and around the complex, more or less in a spiral, gradually approaching the center, all while the defenders prepared for battle, and rained down arrows and worse upon the attackers.Nakayama (2007), p.60‚Äì3. All of that said however, castles were rarely forcibly invaded. It was considered more honorable, and more appropriate, for a defender's army to sally forth from the castle to confront his attackers. When this did not happen, sieges were most often performed not through the use of siege weapons or other methods of forced entry, but by surrounding the enemy castle and simply denying food, water, or other supplies to the fortress. As this tactic could often take months or even years to see results, the besieging army sometimes even built their own castle or fortress nearby. This being the case, \\"the castle was less a defensive fortress than a symbol of defensive capacity with which to impress or discourage the enemy\\". It of course also served as the lord's residence, a center of authority and governance, and in various ways a similar function to military barracks. =Buildings= A yagura, or turret, at Edo Castle in Tokyo. The castle keep, usually three to five stories tall, is known as the tenshukaku (Â§©ÂÆàÈñ£), and may be linked to a number of smaller buildings of two or three stories. Some castles, notably Azuchi, had keeps of as many as seven stories. The keep was the tallest and most elaborate building in the complex, and often also the largest. The number of stories and building layout as perceived from outside the keep rarely corresponds to the internal layout; for example, what appears to be the third story from outside may in fact be the fourth. This certainly must have helped to confuse attackers, preventing them from knowing which story or which window to attack, and likely disorienting the attacker somewhat once he made his way in through a window. The least militarily equipped of the castle buildings, the keep was defended by the walls and towers, and its ornamental role was never ignored; few buildings in Japan, least of all castle keeps, were ever built with attention to function purely over artistic and architectural form. Keeps were meant to be impressive not only in their size and in implying military might, but also in their beauty and the implication of a daimy≈ç's wealth. Though obviously well within the general sphere of Japanese architecture, much of the aesthetics and design of the castle was quite distinct from styles or influences seen in Shint≈ç shrines, Buddhist temples, or Japanese homes. The intricate gables and windows are a fine example of this. On those occasions when a castle was infiltrated or invaded by enemy forces, the central keep served as the last bastion of refuge, and a point from which counter-attacks and attempts to retake the castle could be made. If the castle ultimately fell, certain rooms within the keep would more often than not become the site of the seppuku (ritual suicide) of the daimy≈ç, his family, and closest retainers. Reconstructed Kokura Castle from the nearby Japanese garden. Palisades lined the top of the castle's walls, and patches of trees, usually pines, symbolic of eternity or immortality, were planted along them. These served the dual purpose of adding natural beautiful scenery to a daimy≈ç's home, representing part of his garden, and also obscuring the insides of the castle compound from spies or scouts. A variety of towers or turrets, called yagura (Ê´ì), placed at the corners of the walls, over the gates, or in other positions, served a number of purposes. Though some were used for the obvious defensive purposes, and as watchtowers, others served as water towers or for moon-viewing. As the residences of purportedly wealthy and powerful lords, towers for moon-viewing, balconies for taking in the scenery, tea rooms and gardens proliferated. These were by no means solely martial structures, but many elements served dual purposes. Gardens and orchards, for example, though primarily simply for the purpose of adding beauty and a degree of luxuriousness to the lord's residence, could also provide water and fruit in case of supplies running down due to siege, as well as wood for a variety of purposes.

In 2005, a controversial monument to Soviet Army dead in World War II was built in the park. While supported by many local residents, it was criticized as being inappropriate given that some might interpret it as honoring the USSR under Joseph Stalin. In May 2011 the Audubon Society was given notice to leave by the city of West Hollywood who are planning to demolish the building in 2012 and create underground parking as part of a controversial plan to create a modern park.

Common names include changunga, muruci, murici, nanche, nance, nancite, chacunga, craboo, kraabu, savanna serrette (or savanna serret) and golden spoon. In Jamaica it is called hogberry (plural hogberries). It's valued for its small (between one, and one and a quarter centimeter in diameter) round, sweet yellow fruit which is strongly scented. The fruits have a very pungent and distinct flavor and smell. The taste has been described as combination of pear, lychee and banana. When jarred, the texture resembles that of an green or kalamata olive. Description and habitat Byrsonima crassifolia is a slow-growing large shrub or tree to 33 ft (10 m). Sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits, the tree is native and abundant in the wild, sometimes in extensive stands, in open pine forests and grassy savannas, from central Mexico, through Central America, to Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil; it also occurs in Trinidad, Barbados, Cura√ßao, St. Martin, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and throughout Cuba and the Isle of Pines. The nance is limited to tropical and subtropical climates. In Central and South America, the tree ranges from sea-level to an altitude of 6,000 ft (1,800 m). It is highly drought-tolerant.

Cinema etiquette title card (c. 1912) In films, an intertitle, also known as a title card, is a piece of filmed, printed text edited into the midst of (i.e. inter-) the photographed action at various points. Intertitles used to convey character dialogue are referred to as \\"dialogue intertitles\\", and those used to provide related descriptive/narrative material are referred to as \\"expository intertitles\\". In modern usage, the terms refer to similar text and logo material inserted at or near the start of films and television shows. Silent film era In this era intertitles were always called \\"subtitles\\"The New Historical Dictionary of the American Film Industry, by Anthony Slide, Routledge (2014), entry on Subtitles.Definition 4a of 'subtitle' in the Oxford English Definition: \\"(In) Film, Television, etc.=intertitle. Now chiefly historical.\\" and often had Art Deco motifs. They were a mainstay of silent films once the films became of sufficient length and detail to necessitate dialogue or narration to make sense of the enacted or documented events. The British Film Catalogue credits the 1898 film Our New General Servant by Robert W. Paul as the first British film to use intertitles.The British Film Catalogue, by Denis Gifford (Routledge, 2016), page 142. Film scholar Kamilla Elliott identifies another early use of intertitles in the 1901 British film Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost. The first Academy Awards presentation in 1929 included an award for \\"Best Writing ‚Äì Title Cards\\" that went to Joseph W. Farnham for the films Fair Co-Ed, Laugh, Clown, Laugh, and Telling the World. The award was never given again, as intertitles went out of common use due to the introduction of \\"talkies\\". Modern use In modern use, intertitles are used to supply an epigraph, such as a poem, or to distinguish various \\"acts\\" of a film or multimedia production by use as a title card. However, they are most commonly used as part of a historical drama's epilogue to explain what happened to the depicted characters and events after the conclusion of the story proper. The development of the soundtrack slowly eliminated their utility as a narrative device (they were common for providing narration, but not dialogue, well into the 1930s), but they are occasionally still used as an artistic device. For instance, intertitles were used as a gimmick in Frasier. The BBC's drama Threads uses them to give location, date and information on distant events beyond Sheffield. Law & Order and its related spinoffs used them to give not only the location, but also the date of the upcoming scene. Guy Maddin is a modern filmmaker known for recreating the style of older films, and uses intertitles appropriately. Some locally produced shows, such as quiz bowl game shows, use animated variations of intertitles to introduce the next round. Amateur use Intertitles have had a long history in the area of amateur film as well. The efforts of home movie aficionados to intertitle their works post-production have led to the development of a number of innovative approaches to the challenge. Frequently lacking access to high-quality film dubbing and splicing equipment, amateur film makers must plan ahead when making a film to allow space for filming an intertitle over the existing film. Intertitles may be printed neatly on a piece of paper, a card, or a piece of cardboard and filmed, or they may be formed from adhesive strips and affixed to glass. In the early 1980s, digital recording technology improved to the point where intertitles could be created in born-digital format and recorded directly onto the film. Several specialty accessories from this period such as Sony's HVT-2100 Titler and cameras such as Matsushita's Quasar VK-743 and Zenith VC-1800 could be used to generate intertitles for home movies. Early 1980s video game consoles and applications catering to the demo scene were also adapted for the generation and recording of intertitles for home films. Among these were included the ColecoVision, the Magnavox Odyssey¬≤ (using programs such as the Type & Talk cartridge and the Voice module), the Bally Astrocade (using the built-in Scribbling program or the more advanced Creative Crayon cartridge), and the intertitle-specialized Famicom Titler.

It was named after Michael Murray and created in June 1853, a few months after Alameda County itself was created, encompassing the eastern portion of the county. It was at the time the largest of the six townships in the county.  History  The California gold rush beginning in 1848 drew prospectors from around the world. Many travelled by sea to Alameda County and took the road through Sunol and Livermore valleys towards the mountains. In 1853, Murray Township was established as one of 6 Alameda County townships and given a seat on the board of supervisors. In 1902, Pleasanton Township was created from part of Murray township. By 1910, Pleasanton, with a population of 2883, followed by Murray, with a population of 4137, were the least populous of the seven townships. In its early settlement, the area was mostly used for cattle ranching. The climate proved ideal for wine cultivation, so many land owners planted vineyards from the 1880s onwards. All the towns in Murray Township remained small and dominated by agriculture until the 1950s, when the population boomed and land was subdivided for developments.  Notable locations  The geographical landforms of the area include Amador Valley (named after Jos√© Maria Amador), Livermore Valley (named after Robert Livermore), Sunol Valley (named after Antonio Su√±ol), Alamo Valley, and Tassajara Valley. Arroyo de la Laguna is the major waterway which flows south from Amador Valley into Alameda Creek. Arroyo Valle and Arroyo Mocho feed the Laguna from the mountains to the east. Jos√© Maria Amador was one of the first Spanish settlers to Murray township in 1835, and the town of Amador, which became Dublin, developed from his property. The town of Livermore arose from a station on the Central Pacific railroad in 1869. Corrall Hollow, on the eastern border of the county, was a pass in which coal was discovered in 1860. Pleasanton was located in the former Rancho Valle de San Jose, where the population grew rapidly from 1861. Rancho Santa Rita, or Alviso, was located to the east. Altamont was another town with a post office in the region.

The first permanent settlement in the area was Mission San Jos√©, established in 1797. The township was formed in 1853, and named for president George Washington.  History  Events leading to the formation of the township began in 1797 with the establishment of Mission San Jos√© by the Spanish. Many Ohlone Native Americans settled at the mission to work, ending their traditional village life of hunting and gathering. In 1834, Mexico released California's Native Americans from the control of the mission system, as well as giving the mission property to caretakers. Several Mexican land grants were given from this area. Fulgencia Higuera received a grant known as Rancho Agua Caliente in 1839. Andrews Pico and Juan B. Alvarado were granted the outer lands of Mission San Jos√©, known as Rancho Ex-Mission San Jos√©, in 1846, but it was taken from them by California courts in 1859. Thomas Pacheco and Augustin Alviso received Rancho Potrero de los Cerritos in 1844, and Jos√© de Jesus Vallejo received Rancho Arroyo de la Alameda (which extended into Eden Township) in 1842. The California gold rush beginning in 1848 brought many prospectors to travel through the Mission San Jos√© area to the mountains, making the Mission an important trading site. In 1849, California became a United States territory, and when California achieved statehood in 1850, the area became part of Santa Clara County. In 1853, Alameda County was formed from portions of Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties, and was divided into six townships including Washington. Alvarado in present-day Union City was designated as the county seat.  Geographical features  Washington Township is bounded to the west by the San Francisco Bay, and to the east by a mountain range that includes the 2,520-foot-tall Mission Peak. Alameda Creek runs from east to west through Niles Canyon, which was used as a passage for the first transcontinental railroad. Alameda Creek is the most important stream in Alameda County and the Township. From this Creek is derived the name of the County. Alameda Creek was the former boundary between Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties during the period from 1850, when Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties were formed, to 1853 when Alameda County was carved from these two Counties. The portion of Washington Township south of Alameda Creek is the only part of Alameda County that is not derived from Contra Costa County.

On February 3, 1959, the Lockheed L-188 Electra performing the flight crashed into the East River, killing 65 of the 73 people on board. Poor weather conditions at the destination meant that the crew had to descend through dense clouds and fog, but the aircraft flew lower than the pilots intended and it crashed into the icy river short of the runway at a speed of . American Airlines had been flying the type of aircraft in commercial service for only about two weeks before the accident. Eyewitnesses to the accident reported that the aircraft was flying significantly lower than was normal for planes approaching the airport, while surviving flight crew members claimed that the aircraft's instruments had told them that the flight was operating at normal altitudes right up to the moment of impact. An investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that mistakes by the flight crew, the flight crew's inexperience flying the type of aircraft, and poor weather conditions were the causes of the crash. The conclusion was challenged by the Air Line Pilots Association, who felt that the crash was caused by faulty instruments and poor weather conditions, not by any mistakes made by the highly experienced flight crew. Accident American Airlines Flight 320 was a regularly-scheduled flight between Chicago and New York City using one of the company's newly obtained Lockheed L-188 Electra turbine propeller aircraft. The airline had first started flying the new aircraft on January 23, 1959, and it offered six daily round-trip flights on its routes between New York and Chicago, with plans to expand to other routes once more of the new aircraft were delivered. On the evening of February 3, 1959, the flight was scheduled to leave Chicago's Midway airport, but wind-driven snow had delayed the departure. The flight was eventually airborne at 9:54p.m. Eastern time, fifty four minutes late, and was one of the last flights to depart Chicago that evening before the airport was closed due to the storm. 68 passengers and 5 crew members were aboard, and the trip was expected to take one hour and forty-two minutes. The climb out of Chicago and the flight to the New York City area was uneventful, operating on automatic pilot at a cruising altitude of 21,000 feet. At 11:34p.m., the flight approached the New York City area. Air traffic controllers at LaGuardia airport informed the pilots that the current weather conditions at the airport included overcast skies with a ceiling with a visibility. The tower controller instructed the flight to proceed to the north of the airport, and to prepare to perform a direct approach over the East River to land on runway 22. At 11:55p.m., while the aircraft was from the airport, controllers gave the flight its final landing clearance for runway 22. The flight crew acknowledged the clearance with a simple acknowledgement of \\"320\\", and there was no further radio communication. Moments later, the aircraft struck the surface of the East River about short of the runway, at a speed of . A witness aboard a nearby tugboat reported seeing the aircraft flying very low over the river before it hit the water with a tremendous noise. Another crew member on the same tugboat stated that he saw the aircraft hit the water, and that he thought the aircraft hit at nose-down angle. A witness in a car approaching the Whitestone Bridge described seeing the aircraft pass overhead at an altitude of about . He did not notice if the landing gear was down but he said he could see the whole belly and the lights on the aircraft. Surviving passengers and crew members in the main cabin said that the descent prior to the crash seemed to be uneventful and routine. Interviews with a number of residents in the area revealed that many reported hearing the Electra fly overhead and that it sounded like it was flying lower than usual. The accident was the first crash involving the Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft, which had begun commercial service at American Airlines in the previous weeks. It was the first significant accident involving an American Airlines aircraft since the crash of American Airlines Flight 327 on January 6, 1957. Aftermath A privately-owned tugboat from New England was on the river near the site of the crash when boat's crew heard the impact. It cut loose the barges that it had been towing and was the first to arrive at the scene, lighting up the area with the boat's searchlight. All eight of the survivors of the crash were saved by the crew, including one man who was pulled from below the surface of the water. At least a dozen boats from the Coast Guard and the police, and two police helicopters arrived minutes later. In the dark fog, rescuers could hear screams from survivors, but poor visibility and swift river currents made recovery of victims and survivors extremely difficult. Responders and nearby residents in the area reported hearing cries for help from locations considerably distant from the crash site. Public safety agencies set up four rescue stations along the river to evacuate survivors, but ambulances that were taking injured survivors to hospitals had difficulty navigating the icy roads. Survivors were taken to Flushing Hospital and Queens General Hospital, where some of the initial survivors died of their injuries. Two temporary morgues were also set up on opposite sides of the river to receive victims. By 5:00a.m. the next morning, at least 9 survivors had been recovered, 22 bodies had been located, and 39 other victims were still missing. High winds and driving rain led the searchers to suspend the rescue operation. The New York Red Cross furnished supplies of rare blood types to aid the victims of the crash. Bodies that had been recovered were taken to Queens General Hospital for identification with assistance by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 25 city detectives. The agents used fingerprint records from its immigration, personal identification, and war service files to identify the victims. After the impact, the body of the aircraft had broken into several pieces, with a twenty-foot section of the fuselage the largest intact section. After two hours, only of the tail of the aircraft was visible above the surface of the water. Searchers on boats and on the shore picked up plane debris, personal belongings, and mail that had been aboard the aircraft. In Washington DC, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) immediately dispatched two investigators as soon as authorities became aware of the crash, and ordered the airline's records to be impounded. An additional team of 25 investigators was assembled and dispatched later the next day. The team was given the task of investigating all aspects of the flight, including the weather, flight operations, engines and propellers, flight instruments, and aircraft structures. Queens County District Attorney Frank O'Connor also started an inquiry, with the aim of setting up a system of rescue boats to serve the city's two airports. The House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee called the head of the Federal Aviation Agency to report on the accident in a closed session in the days after the accident. After the two-and-a-half-hour meeting, a special House subcommittee was named to investigate the crash and the overall safety issues raised by the transition to jet and turboprop aircraft. Days after the crash, news sources started reporting that there were safety systems that had not been in place at the airport that could have helped prevent the crash. A representative of the Air Line Pilots Association said that a system of flashing lights known as the Electronic Flash Approach System could have helped the pilot judge his altitude, if it had been installed. The association also called for the installation of a more comprehensive instrument landing system that would have provided altitude guidance to flight crews landing on runway 22 in addition to the existing system that provided horizontal guidance. Such a system was already installed at the opposite end of the runway that the flight had been approaching. At the time, there were only two airports in the United States that had such a system installed on both ends of a runway. At a meeting on February 5,commissioners of the Port of New York Authority explained that the installation of such a system on runway 22 was considered to be very difficult because the approach lighting system would block the waterway used by ships to reach docks in Queens. Aircraft The involved aircraft taken prior to the accident The aircraft was a Lockheed L-188 Electra turbine propeller aircraft, serial number 1015, registered as tail number N6101A. It had been manufactured by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation on November 27, 1958. At the time of the crash, the aircraft had flown for a total of 302 hours. It was powered by four Allison 501-D13 engines. Promoted as an efficient, fast, and profitable aircraft, the Electra was the first turbine propeller aircraft to be produced in the United States. The first plane was delivered to Eastern Air Lines in October 1958, who began operating commercial flights with the aircraft on January 1, 1959. American Airlines took delivery of its first Electra in December 1958 and its first commercial flight was twelve days before the crash. After the crash of American Airlines flight 320, two more Electras crashed in the following months after suffering catastrophic structural failures; Braniff Flight 542 crashed in September 1959 and Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 710 crashed in March 1960. Both incidents resulted in the loss of everybody aboard. After extensive research, Lockheed identified and corrected a flaw in the engine mounts which had been the cause of the structural failures of the other two crashes, but the negative publicity surrounding all of the accidents involving the plane within a short period of time led to the loss of public confidence in the safety of the aircraft, and only 174 were ever produced. Passengers and crew The flight carried 68 passengers and 5 crew members, all residents of the United States. Of the 68 passengers, 5 survived; the bodies of two of the victims were never recovered. One of the two flight attendants and the captain of the flight died in the crash. Included in the passengers who died in the crash was Beulah Zachary, the executive producer of the television series Kukla, Fran and Ollie that was broadcast from 1947 to 1957. Also aboard the plane was Robert Emerson, a research professor at the University of Illinois who was internationally known for his research into plant photosynthesis, and Herbert Greenwald, a Chicago real estate developer. The pilot of the flight, Captain Albert Hunt DeWitt, was 59 years old. He started his career at American Airlines in 1929 by flying for Thompson Aeronautical Corporation of Cleveland, which was later acquired by American. A resident of Decatur, Michigan, he was qualified to fly all of the aircraft that had been operated by American Airlines and was considered one of the most experienced commercial pilots in the world, with seven million miles flown. He had a total of 28,135 hours of flight experience, including 48 hours in the Lockheed Electra and 2,500 hours of instrument time, and had at one time acted as one of American's chief pilots in the New York area. He learned to fly airplanes when he was 24 years old. In 1930, he had been involved in an accident while he was flying a mail plane over Mishawaka, Indiana on his way to Chicago. Caught in a severe snowstorm, his aircraft stalled and entered a spin, but he was able to jump out of his plane before it crashed and he landed in a 75-foot-high tree. Before joining American Airlines, he had been a barnstormer in Indiana and Michigan and had been an instructor for various flying schools and clubs in the 1920s. He served in both World Wars; in World War I, he was a motorcycle courier, and during World War II, he served as an instructor at flight schools in New York and Chicago. He had planned to retire that May, but did not survive the crash of Flight 320. His cause of death was listed as drowning, but the medical examiner stated that he had also suffered severe internal injuries that would probably have been fatal had he not drowned. The first officer, 33-year-old Frank Hlavacek, was a resident of Wilmette, Illinois and had been employed with the company for eight years. He had a total of 10,192 logged hours, of which 36 hours were in the Electra. He had been flying since he was 14 years old and had served with the United States Army Air Forces in World War II. Before joining American Airlines, he had owned his own air service based in La Jolla, California. After the crash, he helped two of the survivors reach the remnants of the plane's wing, where they were rescued. He suffered a broken jaw and pelvis, and two broken legs in the crash as well as internal injuries, but eventually recovered and returned to work at American Airlines. The flight engineer, Warren Cook, was 36 years old and had been working for American Airlines for eleven years. He had a total of 8,700 flying hours, of which 81 were in the Electra. He served in the United States Army Air Corps from 1940 to 1945. In the accident, he suffered a badly wrenched back, cuts, and bruises. After recovering from his injuries, he returned to work at American Airlines. Crash investigation Within two hours of the accident, investigators conducted an interview with flight engineer Warren Cook, in which he stated that the flight's descent was completely routine right up to the point where the aircraft unexpectedly hit the water. They were unable to immediately interview first officer Frank Hlavacek because of his medical condition, but when interviewed several days later, he told investigators that he had been calling out indicated altitudes to Captain DeWitt during the descent in one-hundred-foot increments as they approached the runway. He said that he had barely gotten the words out for five hundred feet when the plane struck the river. Cook's statement to investigators, taken independently at a separate hospital, confirmed that they struck the river just as Hlavacek was saying \\"five hundred feet\\". Recovery of the wreckage of the aircraft began as soon as the weather conditions permitted, with 25 percent of the plane recovered by February 5, and fifty percent by the following day. The day after the crash, salvage cranes attempted to raise the fuselage of the aircraft to the surface of the water, but they were only briefly successful before it broke apart and most of the it fell back into the water. The tail section was raised by crews on the evening of February 5, and newspaper articles reported that the damage to that section suggested that the aircraft may have crashed in a \\"nose up\\" position, as though the pilot had noticed at the last minute that he was well short of the runway. Divers were brought in to locate missing sections of the aircraft beneath the surface of the water, but recovery efforts were hindered by high winds, strong river currents, and murky waters. Some pieces of the plane had been swept away by currents and had had been found as far away as Northport, Long Island, more than thirty miles away. Each piece was identified, tagged, and cleaned off, and relocated to Hangar 9 of the Marine Terminal of La Guardia Airport. The nose section and cockpit was recovered late on February 7. The cockpit was salvaged in good condition, with the spring-wound clock on the instrument panel still working when the section was recovered from the river. Investigators predicted that it would take at least two weeks to check all of the instruments to determine if they were functioning correctly at the time of the accident. Early reports from the investigation revealed that the condition of the flight control surfaces revealed that at the time of impact, the aircraft had not been in a violent turn or dive when it hit the water. On February 9, the Federal Aviation Agency announced that flying restrictions would be put in place on bad-weather landings by Lockheed Electra aircraft. The restrictions increased the minimum visibility conditions required for landing in poor conditions. In communications with flight crews, both American Airlines and Eastern Airlines described the restrictions as temporary only, likely lasting only a few days. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation expressed disappointment in the new restrictions, but agreed to cooperate with the investigation to the fullest extent. The following day, the Agency reversed course, and said that the Electra airliners could resume normal operation if they replaced the new altimeters with old-style altimeters. Both airlines agreed to immediately replace the altimeters as a precautionary step. The Agency also extended the order to include the requirement that new-style altimeters that had been installed in Boeing 707 aircraft needed to be replaced. An illustration of a new-style altimeter, with a single needle and rotating drums to show an altitude of 6,000 feet An illustration of the old- style three-pointer altimeter showing an altitude of 10,180 feet The altimeters used in the aircraft had been an early focus of the investigation. The units that Lockheed had used in its Electra turboprops were a different style than what had been used in older piston-type aircraft. The older type used three hands of different lengths to indicate the aircraft's altitude, but the new design combined a needle that displayed hundreds of feet and a rectangular display with numbers printed on rotating drums that indicated the thousands of feet. The Kollman Instrument Corporation, which built both types, described the new style as a \\"precision drum altimeter\\" and said that it had been \\"developed as a result of a human engineering study made by the Aero Medical Laboratory, by an unnamed Government body, and at the instigation of the Air Force, primarily to meet the needs of faster flying.\\" The Air Force had experienced numerous problems with the older-style altimeters where its pilots had made 10,000-foot mistakes. Pilots training on the new aircraft reported several instances where they had misread the altitude on the new altimeters, causing them to misread the aircraft's altitude by up to 1,000 feet. Because of the confusion, early reports said that the airline had made plans to install an additional third altimeter of the old type in the center of the pilot's panel while continuing to use the newer style altimeters. Pilots for Eastern Airlines who had been flying the Electra aircraft also complained about the new style of altimeter, stating that not only were they easy to misinterpret, but they tended to lag behind the older style. That airline had installed a third, old-style, altimeter in their cockpits. American Airlines defended the new style altimeter as \\"a new and far superior altimeter with finer gradations\\" and denied that it had received complaints with the instruments. It acknowledged that it had planned to install a third altimeter in the cockpits, but said that the third unit was planned to be a new-style model. At the time of the accident, the aircraft in Flight 320 still only had the two original altimeters. An investigative hearing of the CAB began in New York City on March 18, 1959. In testimony before the board, first officer Hlavacek confirmed the information that he had given in his earlier interviews and stated that he and the other crew members had checked their altimeters several times during the flight including when they passed by Newark, New Jersey, saying that his and the pilot's altimeter were very close. He said that at the time of the crash, the pilot had been using the automatic pilot with partial manual control during the approach, and also said that some ice had formed at the top of the windshield, but it had not been considered serious. He said that he had not seen any sign of the runway through the windshield ahead, but that he had caught sight of a few reddish lights flashing past his side windows just before impact. The investigative board confronted Flight engineer Cook with transcripts of an interview that he had given immediately after the accident, in which he stated that the aircraft's altimeter had shown under one hundred feet at the time of impact, but he had later testified that it showed five hundred feet. Cook stated that at the time, he was in a state of shock and that in his mind he had mistaken the one on the drum to mean one hundred feet instead of one thousand feet. He confirmed that he had turned on de-icing equipment before the plane had started its descent, and confirmed that the pilot had been using the automatic pilot to fly the plane during the descent. He said that he had been flying with Captain Dewitt since 1951, that he knew him well, and that it was the pilot's custom to use the automatic pilot to descend until about 400 feet above the runway, when he would switch to manual control. He also testified that he had seen nothing but blackness through the windshield up to the time of the crash. Accident investigators took the altimeters that were recovered from the crash to the instrument shop at La Guardia Airport for detailed examination. On February 26, an article in the Chicago Tribune reported that after the altimeters had been cleaned of corrosion, water, and dirt, they had been tested in a pressure chamber. According to the article, both of the devices functioned normally down to 1000 feet above ground pressure level, but below 1,000 feet they stuck or lagged considerably. However, in official testimony before the board, the manufacturer of the altimeters submitted a report to the board that said that their investigation concluded that the instruments did not have any mechanical failure or malfunction before the crash. When they had been salvaged from the water, the pilot's and co-pilot's instruments had indicated minus 1,500 feet and minus 1,640 feet respectively, reflecting damage to parts of the instruments caused by immersion pressure. When questioned, the investigator acknowledged that there was no means to determine what the altimeters showed at the time of impact. In testimony before the CAB, the American Airlines's director of flying said that the identical malfunction of two altimeters at the same time was \\"almost mathematically impossible\\". The CAB heard from experts from the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation who had attempted to reproduce a 500-foot error in the reported altitude caused by ice buildup in the air pressure lines. They flew an Electra plane behind an Air Force tanker that was spraying ice-producing water to see if they could cause the pressure line to clog. In other tests, they artificially plugged the line, affected the opening various equipment and even had a mechanic spray a stream of water directly into the pressure port. None of the tests produced the 500-foot error that was reported by the pilots, and produced an error only of forty or fifty feet. In trying to determine why the crew of the Electra had not seen the runway ahead of them, the CAB heard from two pilots of a Northeast Airlines DC-3 that had landed at La Guardia Airport a minute or two in front of the Electra. They testified that they had had no problem coming in under the 400-foot cloud ceiling and that they could see the whole mile-long runway ahead of them. However, interviews with crash survivors and crew members of the rescue tug suggested that an isolated patch of low clouds and fog was hanging over the river at the time of the crash. The CAB released a final report on the accident on January 10, 1960. The investigators concluded that the crew had been preoccupied with aspects of flight and had neglected to monitor essential flight instruments during the descent, leading to a premature descent below landing minimums. Contributing to the accident were factors including the crew's limited experience with the aircraft type, a faulty approach technique in which the autopilot was used to or almost to the surface, an erroneous setting of the pilot's altimeter, marginal weather in the approach area, possible misinterpretation of the altimeter and the rate of descent indicators on the aircraft, and the crew's sensory illusion with respect to height and altitude resulting from a lack of visual references. The board was critical of the airline's lack of adequate simulator training on the aircraft before placing it into passenger service, and made recommendations to the FAA that all large turbine-engine aircraft used in air transportation be equipped with a flight recorder. Over 90 percent of the primary structural components of the aircraft and most of the systems components were recovered by investigators. They found that at the moment of impact, the flaps were approximately in the approach position, the landing gear was extended, and propeller blade angles were relatively uniform and consistent with the power readings obtained from the recovered aircraft instruments and consistent with the testimony of the crew regarding the power being used during the approach. Neither of the two vertical speed indicator mechanisms were recovered. Both altimeters were recovered, but since the diaphragms of both had been overstressed due to submersion, it was impossible to establish the calibration or accuracy of either altimeter before the crash. Investigators obtained all of the maintenance records including pilot complaints of all operators, civil and military, of the type of altimeter used in the flight. None of the reported incidents involved more than one of the altimeters installed at a time, and after reviewing the possibility of a simultaneous failure of both altimeters, the CAB concluded that it would involve such an extreme mathematical improbability that it chose to reject that theory as well as reject portions of the testimony of the surviving crew members. It also concluded that after consideration of all possible scenarios, that a failure of just one of the altimeters was also unlikely to have occurred. Based upon eyewitness testimony and analysis of the point of impact, the CAB concluded that it was likely that one or more of the pilots had misread the altimeter due to their unfamiliarity with the new style. It also concluded that there was a possibility that the crew had misread the vertical speed indicators, which also used a different scale than what had been used in older aircraft or in the training received by the captain. The CAB concluded that all of the required airport, boundary, and runway lights were on and functioning at the time of the accident. However, because the lights were slanted upward at between three and five degrees, and because of a dike located between the end of runway 22 and the water, the CAB concluded that they would not have been visible to the crew because of the aircraft's premature descent below the cloud level. The CAB's conclusions were soundly criticized by the president of the Air Line Pilots Association, who called the report \\"grossly inaccurate in a number of respects\\", and that the report failed to satisfactorily explain the reason for the accident and assumed factors that had not been established by fact. He said that pilots at American Airlines were united in protest against the report, saying it \\"slandered and wrongfully accused\\" crew members of the plane, and was aimed at \\"conveniently writing the accident off the books\\" rather than accurately determining a cause. He said that in the association's judgement, the crash was the result of marginal weather conditions and inadequate approach and lighting aids at the airport. First officer Frank Hlavacek said he was \\"furious\\" over the CAB report, saying the board tried to take the easy way out by blaming a dead captain. He said he hoped that American Airlines would protest the report. Additional investigations On February 6, 1959 a special House subcommittee was named to investigate the crash and overall safety issues that the aviation industry was experiencing while transitioning from piston aircraft to jet and turboprop aircraft. The subcommittee was headed by Representative John Bell Williams of Mississippi, a former World War II bomber pilot. Representative Oren Harris of Arkansas said the subcommittee would look into the equipment that was being used on the new aircraft as well as the training of their crews. The five members of the subcommittee visited La Guardia Field on February 12, and inspected the runway where Flight 320 had been trying to reach, but refused to publicly discuss the results of their investigation. In March, the committee announced that it was investigating the Federal Aviation Agency for suppressing information that the committee had requested about the difficulties that had been encountered with the new type of altimeters used in the Lockheed Electra and Boeing 707 aircraft. During hearings of the aviation subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee in January 1960, the safety director for the CAB testified that if the La Guardia runway had been equipped with high density lights, \\"the accident probably would not have happened\\". He also advocated for more training of copilots of aircraft and the installation of electronic flight recorders in aircraft to assist with accident investigations. As a result of the testimony, three of the senators on the subcommittee called for the installation of modern lighting systems at Chicago's Midway airport and other landing fields, and the implementation of requirements that copilots be certified on the aircraft they fly. Elwood Richard Quesada, administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency, testified that the government had pledged to pay 75 percent of the cost to install high intensity lighting and radar approaches at La Guardia prior to the accident, but that officials at the airport had declined to pay the 25 percent required for local cooperation.

It was created from a group of Mexican land grants that were added to Alameda County when the county was established in 1853. Today there are several public and private agencies serving the region.  History  The area of Eden Township comprises five land grants given by the Mexican government: Sobrante Rancho, Rancho San Leandro (given to Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Estudillo), Rancho San Lorenzo, (given to Guillermo Castro), Rancho San Lorenzito (given to Francisco and Barbara Soto), and Rancho Arroyo de la Alameda (given to Jos√© de Jes√∫s Vallejo). In 1850, when California became a state, Eden was within Contra Costa County. In 1853, Alameda County was established from five townships of Contra Costa County, as well as Washington Township from Santa Clara county. In 1856, Eden Township was given one seat on the Alameda County board of supervisors. Eden Township was known as a major poultry producing area from the late 19th to the early 20th century.  Geographic features  The region stretches from the marshes of San Francisco Bay on the west to the borders of Contra Costa County and Murray Township to the east. The eastern side is hilly, surrounding Castro Valley and the flatlands of Hayward. San Leandro and San Lorenzo creeks traverse Eden Township from east to west. San Leandro Creek flows through Lake Chabot, an artificial reservoir that was formerly used for drinking water.  Services  Although the township is no longer run by a single governmental body, several services still operate using this area as an administrative district. The Eden Health District was founded in 1948 to operate Eden Hospital in Castro Valley. It is run by a board of directors elected by residents of the district. After 1998, the district no longer operates Eden Hospital, but operates to provide grants to medical organizations. It is funded entirely by leasing the office buildings it owns. Eden Township Substation is a division of Alameda County Sheriff's office that includes the unincorporated areas of Eden Township, as well as other unincorporated areas, such as Sunol and Livermore Valley. Its office is located on Foothill Blvd in San Leandro. Castro Valley/Eden Area Chamber of Commerce is a private association of businesses located in Castro Valley, San Lorenzo, Ashland, and Cherryland. Besides promoting local businesses, it also hosts and participates in local community events. Eden Area Regional Occupational Program provides career technical training for both high school students and adults in the area. It is offered through a partnership with Chabot College, Castro Valley Unified School District, and San Lorenzo Unified School District.

The chestnut horse was sired by English Derby winner Blenheim, out of the broodmare Dustwhirl. Whirlaway was bred at Calumet Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. Trained by Ben A. Jones and ridden by Eddie Arcaro, Whirlaway won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1941. With his win in the Travers Stakes, he remains to this day the only horse to have won the Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing. Whirlaway was widely known as \\"Mr. Longtail\\" because his tail was especially long and thick and it would blow far out behind him during races, flowing dramatically in the wind. He was voted the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 1940 by Turf & Sports Digest magazine. The rival Daily Racing Form award was won by Our Boots. Background Jimmy Jones, son of the colt's trainer, recalled that \\"Whirlaway was a creature of habit. You had to create habits for him. So we created the habits we wanted him to do.\\" Whirlaway was regarded as having a \\"quirky\\" personality.http://www.horsecollaborative.com/see-tail-know-whirlaway/ The champion colt had a habit of \\"bearing out,\\" drifting toward the middle of the racetrack, during the latter part of his races and losing as a result. In preparations for the Kentucky Derby, this had been such a problem that trainer Ben A. Jones fitted the colt with a full-cup blinker over his right eye. In Whirlaway's final workout before the Derby, Jones cut a small hole in the blinker so that the horse had a tiny field of vision. Jones positioned himself ten feet off the inner rail and told jockey Eddie Arcaro to ride the horse through that space. Whirlaway was able to see his trainer, Arcaro was able to keep him on a straight path, and Whirlaway won the Kentucky Derby by tying the current (as of 2018) record margin of 8 lengths. Racing record Trained by Ben A. Jones and ridden by Arcaro, Whirlaway won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1941. He also won the Lawrence Realization Stakes and the Travers Stakes that year; Whirlaway is the only horse ever to win both the Triple Crown and the Travers, sometimes referred to as a \\"superfecta\\". He was voted the Horse of the Year in 1941, beating Alsab by 96 votes to 91 in a poll conducted by the Turf and Sport Digest magazine. A year later, Whirlaway repeated his win in the poll, beating Alsab with 76 votes to his rival's 45. Arcaro was the sole rider for Whirlaway in all of his 3-year-old victories, but dismounted for most of the 1942 season, when he served a long suspension for racing infractions. Jockey George Woolf took the reins for the majority of the 1942 season. In a major upset on July 4, 1942 at Empire City Race Track, Whirlaway ran second to Tola Rose who easily won by four lengths in track record time.New York Times July 5, 1942 article titled \\"34,728 See Upset\\" Retrieved July 18, 2018 On July 15, Whirlaway broke the Suffolk Downs track record for a mile and one-eighth with a time of 1:48 1/5 in winning the Massachusetts Handicap. Whirlaway and Alsab continued their 1941 rivalry through 1942. On September 19, 1942, Alsab defeated the Triple Crown champion in a match race at Narragansett Park in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.Lawrence Journal-World ‚Äì September 21, 1942 Although Whirlaway closed strongly through the stretch, Alsab lasted by a nose as both horses flew home through the stretch run. Whirlaway was named Horse of the Year for 1942 after defeating Alsab in a subsequent race and having 12 wins for the year to Alsab's 9. Woolf, who had previously won the Pimlico Special in 1938 on Seabiscuit and in 1940 on Challedon, rode the 1941 Triple Crown winner at a leisurely pace during the 1942 Pimlico Special in a walkover victory. No opponent had been found to challenge Whirlaway for the race. On December 12, more than twenty thousand people turned out to watch Whirlaway win the inaugural Louisiana Handicap at the Fair Grounds Race Course. The newly formed Thoroughbred Racing Association staged this event as a war-relief effort. Whirlaway entered stud at Calumet Farm in the spring of 1944 at age six. Among his best offspring were Scattered (winner of the Coaching Club American Oaks); Whirl Some (Selima Stakes), Dart By (All American Handicap) and Whirling Bat (winner of the 1951 Louisiana Derby). In August 1950, Calumet Farm leased Whirlaway to French breeder Marcel Boussac, who stood the horse at his breeding farm, Haras de Fresnay-le- Buffard. Boussac purchased Whirlaway from Calumet in September 1952.Thoroughbred Record 27 September 1952 The stallion died at Boussac's French stud in 1953.Thoroughbred Record, 11 April 1953Whirlaway at Find a Grave Whirlaway was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1959.

A fence, also known as a receiver, mover, or moving man, is an individual who knowingly buys stolen goods in order to later resell them for profit. The fence acts as a middleman between thieves and the eventual buyers of stolen goods who may not be aware that the goods are stolen. As a verb, the word describes the behaviour of the thief in the transaction: The burglar fenced the stolen radio. This sense of the term came from thieves' slang, first attested c. 1700, from the notion of such transactions providing a defence against being caught.\\"Fence\\" in the Word Detective The term remains in common use in all major dialects of modern English, all of which spell it with a \\"c\\" even though the source word in some dialects (particularly American English) is now spelled defense. The thief who patronises the fence is willing to accept a low profit margin in order to reduce his risks by instantly \\"washing his hands\\" of the black market loot and disassociating from the criminal act that procured it. After the sale, the fence recoups his investment by disguising the stolen nature of the goods (via methods such as repackaging and altering/effacing serial numbers) and reselling the goods as near to the white market price as possible without drawing suspicion. This process often relies on a legal business (such as a pawnshop, flea market or street vendor) in order to \\"launder\\" the stolen goods by intermixing them with legally-purchased items of the same type. The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he is able to secretly pay thieves a very low price for \\"hot\\" goods that cannot be easily sold on the open markets. Fencing is illegal in all countries, but legally proving a violation of anti-fencing laws can be difficult. History of receiving The fence, or receiver, is an old kind of criminal, historically attested in many countries and with deep and complex dynamics within society. = Early modern England = Receiving was a widespread crime in Modern England and an increasingly crucial concern for the English government of that period. It involved many other kinds of activities and crimes, and it saw its peak in the early 18th century with the notorious Jonathan Wild. Receiving is intrinsically connected to theft, as receivers, by definition, buy previously stolen goods in order to make profit out of them later. When organised theft grew increasingly important in London thanks to largely supportive receivers, the establishment started to fight it off with new laws, often aimed at receivers: receiving was acknowledged as the very core of property crime. Receiving was not considered as a felony (crime) in common law until 1691, when fences became potential targets of charges as accessories to theft. This meant that in order to judge a suspected receiver, it was necessary to condemn the related thief first. Later laws further focused on receivers, especially the 1718 Transportation Act, which, together with other measures, made fences main felons and not simply accessories to other felonies. Nonetheless, it was not easy to prove that a dealer knowingly accepted stolen goods, especially without the related theft event being fully cleared out.Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.189-90. Proceedings stored in the Old Bailey Online archive where the offence category is receiving are 5664. Of these, 1973 have a verdict category of guilty.Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, 22 November 2015), Searched Old Bailey Proceedings for all offences where offence category is receiving and verdict category is guilty. The 1718 Transportation Act also made a felony of returning goods for a fee, revealing that by then, receiving had already been widely taken to the next stage: returning goods to their owner, for a fee, instead of selling them in the second-hand market. Thieves could act as go-betweens themselves, but go-betweens could raise some suspicions, while relying on receivers added a safety layer against effective prosecution. A victim of theft was often willing to pay in order to get his goods back, in order to spare himself further troubles and/or if the items taken had the potential to reveal unflattering details about his personal affairs. In addition to that, for many centuries, prosecution in England was entirely at the expense (of personal money, time and effort) of the prosecutor.Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.41-48. Therefore, also considering the difficulty of actually proving receiving in courts, common people, especially shopkeepers,Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.250. often preferred compounding, feeling that prosecuting was not worth it. This gave a considerable advantage to receivers. Ticket to the hanging of Jonathan Wild. In order to effectively act as go-betweens for compounding, or brokers, fences needed to personally know thieves or have ways to easily interact and bargain with them for a common benefit about compounding: nobody was in a better position to do so than thief-takers. Thief-takers grew increasingly notorious in England as a reward was introduced by the Crown for each successfully condemned criminal.Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.55-59. Some of them, such as Anthony Dunn, publicly referred to as \\"pretended Thiefe-taker\\" in a 1707 document,Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.251. used their social power as thief-takers as an advantage for receiving. Thief-takers were usually so involved with thieves and gangs of thieves that they could easily condemn them for the reward, or use this power to intimidate and command thieves to do their biddings: in exchange of clemency or protection from capture or condemnation, they could have thieves to steal under their command. Indeed, thief-takers could act as direct instigators, supporting their thieves with intelligence or offering them shelter at need (when convenient), and then act as receivers with the stolen goods.Beattie, , J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.159-60. Through parallel occupations, receivers could feed their own business. Confirmation of how thief-taking and receiving were tightly connected could be seen in the career of Charles Hitchen, who was known as a thief-taker. He bought off the position of Under City Marshal through his wife's money in order to have one of the best positions amongst the thief- takers of the City. However, a vast part of his income actually came from the receiving activity related to the network of connections with London's underworld. Hitchen controlled this network through his official (that is to say, legal) position as a thief-taker.Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, pp.253-254. The synergy between receiving, theft and corruption, as well as official activities such as thief-taking or pawnbroking was a huge dynamic bond where each element enhanced the others in a vicious circle.Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.232. The master of this powerful synergy of London underworld was Jonathan Wild, who rapidly replaced his previous master, Charles Hitchen, in 1713, and rapidly gained control of London's crime and the title of \\"thief-taker general\\". His power was due to his ruthless thief-taking and intimidation activities as well as a complex web of intelligence also built around the diffusion of newspapers. However, overly bold receiving was his undoing,Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.381. as it grew so large and complex a matter to prompt the English government to promote further laws against receiving and related activities, such as the Transportation Act in 1718, also known as \\"Jonathan Wild Act\\",Hitchcock and Schoemaker. Tales from the Hanging Court. London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, p.20. and its extension in 1720, which made returning goods for a fee a felony of the same importance and punishment as the crime (theft) related to the goods returned (which meant a capital offence in most cases, with raised potential reward for definitive evidence, from ¬£40 to ¬£140).Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.39. Eventually, the government decided to directly take action against Wild through lawyers, succeeding in condemning and executing him in 1725.  Women and receiving  There is no registered case of female fences of the same fame of Wild or Hitchen. However, women had active roles in both receiving and theft.Kermode, and Walker. Women, Crime and the Courts in Early Modern England. Chapel Hill London: U of North Carolina, 1994, p.93. Elizabeth Hitchen, Hitchen's wife, gave her inheritance money to her husband in order to buy the Under City Marshal office for his plans. Moreover, women could also be active fences. For example, Elizabeth Fisher managed her own receiving business in her husband's alehouse.Kermode, and Walker. Women, Crime and the Courts in Early Modern England.

Of these, 1858 have a defendant gender category of female.Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, 27 January 2018), Searched Old Bailey Proceedings for all offences where offence category is receiving and defendant gender is female. = Early modern English literature = Receiving grew increasingly important in Early Modern society, and combined with the increasing interest of society on reading, it became the source for many writers, such as Daniel Defoe, with Moll Flanders and John Gay, with The Beggar's Opera. These works reflect how receiving was conceived and portrayed by authors.  Moll Flanders  Moll Flanders is a novel intended to narrate the whole life of its protagonist, referred to as Moll Flanders, but a relevant part of it is about her becoming a master thief. Moll's activity as a thief largely relied on the protection and support of her governess, who acted also as a receiver for the goods stolen by her affiliates. She is the one who buys Moll's stolen goods the first time, as Moll narrates \\"I was now at a loss for a market for my goods, ... At last I resolved to go to my old governess.\\" Therefore, the governess character sealed Moll's fate as a thief, and eventually taught her the basics of thievery redirecting Moll to work with other senior thieves. With these events, Defoe shows how crucial as well as subtle receiving was in building the whole of crime activity in London. The Governess is officially a pawnbroker, and she uses this legal business to recycle stolen goods into the secondary market. Sometimes, such as in the case of a silver inscribed mug stolen by Moll, she smelts metals, in order to avoid getting caught while re-selling. Along with receiving activity, she actively protects and supports many criminals and thieves in order to secure a steady income to her activity. The same governess goes on in protecting and offering refuge to her affiliates whenever possible, or recruiting thieves into small groups, always via middlemen, in order to protect their thieves' identities in case some of them were caught and willing to confess. She is also a main intelligence source and often a direct instigator to theft such as in a case of fire in a well-off house in the neighbourhood (more vulnerable to theft because of the sudden emergency), and finally becomes a broker for goods stolen by Moll to a drunken gentleman. In that case, the amount gained is allegedly greater than what she would have gained by standard re-selling in the secondary market.The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders &c.; on Project Gutenberg, accessed on 23 November 2015. The Governess embodies female social cunning in London's underworld, from Defoe's point of view. She is a typical receiver of her time, and whereas many male receivers used thief-taking as an official business, she relies on pawnbroking. =China= Under traditional Chinese law a fence, or receiver, (Èä∑Ë¥ìËÄÖ), was a merchant who bought and sold stolen goods. Fences were part of the extensive network of accomplices in the criminal underground of Ming and Qing China. Their occupation entailed criminal activity, but as fences often had a non-criminal primary occupation, they acted as liaisons between the respectable community and the criminal underworld, living a ‚Äúprecarious existence on the fringes of respectable society‚Äù. Fences often worked alongside bandits in a network of criminal accomplices that was essential to ensuring both the safety and the success of fences. The path into the occupation of a fence stemmed, in a large degree, from necessity. As most fences came from the ranks of poorer people, they often took whatever work they could - both legal and illegal. In many circumstances, working as a fence was an option that was not too strenuous, but had the potential to bring in a fair sum of income. Most fences worked within their own town or village. For example, in some satellite areas of the capital, military troops lived within or close to the commoner population and they had the opportunity to hold illegal trades with commoners. In areas like Baoding and Hejian, local peasants and community members not only purchased military livestock such as horses and cattle, but also helped to hide the ‚Äústolen livestock from [the] military‚Äù. In such circumstances that benefited them, local peasants and other members of the community became fences and hid criminal activities from officials, in exchange for goods or money from soldiers. Types of fences Most fences were not individuals who only bought and sold stolen goods to make a living. The majority of fences had a variety of official occupations within the \\"polite\\" society. These occupations included labourers and peddlers, among others. Such individuals often encountered criminals, often in the markets while working, and formed acquaintances and temporary associations for mutual aid and protection. In one example, an owner of a teahouse overheard the conversation between Deng Yawen, a criminal, and others planning a robbery and offered to help to sell the loot for a portion of the spoils. At times, the robbers themselves filled the role of fences, selling to people they met on the road. This may actually have been preferable for robbers, in certain circumstances, because they would not have to pay the fence a portion of the spoils. Butchers were also prime receivers for stolen animals because of the simple fact that owners could no longer recognise their livestock after the animal had been slaughtered. Animals were very valuable commodities within Ming China, and a robber could potentially sustain a living from stealing livestock and selling them to butcher-fences. Although the vast majority of the time, fences worked with physical stolen property, fences who also worked as itinerant barbers also sold information as a good. Itinerant barbers often amassed important sources of information and news as they travelled, and sold significant pieces of information to those who offered money. Often, such information was sold to criminals in search of places to hide or individuals to rob. In this way, itinerant barbers also served the role as a keeper of information that could be sold to both members of the criminal underground, as well as powerful clients. Fences not only sold items such as jewellery and clothing but was also occasionally involved in human trafficking hostages that banditires had kidnapped. Women and children were the easiest to sell and among the most common ‚Äúobjects‚Äù the fences sold. Most of the female hostages were sold to fences and then sold as prostitutes, wives, or concubines. One example of human trafficking can be seen from Chen Akuei's gang who abducted a servant girl and sold her to Lin Baimao, who in turn sold her as a wife for thirty pieces of silver. In contrast to women who required beauty to sell for a high price, children were sold regardless of their physical appearance or family background. Young boys were often sold as servants or entertainers, while young girls were often sold as prostitutes. Network of connections Like merchants of honest goods, one of the most significant tools of a fence was their network of connections. As they were the middlemen between robbers and clients, fences needed to form and maintain widespread connections in both the ‚Äúpolite‚Äù society, as well as among criminals. However, there were cases in which members of the so-called ‚Äúwell- respected‚Äù society become receivers and harbourers. They not only help bandits to sell the stolen goods but also acted as agents of the bandits in collecting protection money from local merchants and residents. These \\"part-time\\" fences with high social status used their connection with bandits to help themselves gain social capital as well as wealth. It was extremely important to their occupation that fences maintained a positive relationship with their customers, especially their richer gentry clients. When some members of the local elites joined the ranks of fences, they not only protected bandits to protect their own business interests, but they actively took down any potential threats to their illegal profiting, even government officials. In the Zhejiang Province, the local elites not only caused the dismissal of provincial commissioner, Zhu Wan, but also eventually ‚Äú[drove] him to suicide‚Äù. It was also essential for them to maintain a relationship with bandits in order to protect their livelihood. However, it was just as true that bandits needed fences to make a living. As a result, fences often held dominance in their relationship with bandits. Taking advantage of their dominance in their relationships with bandits, fences also cheated bandits by manipulating the prices they paid bandits for stolen property. This was possible because fences often had an official and legal means of making a living, as well as illegal activities and could threaten to turn in bandits into the authorities. Safe houses Aside from simply buying and selling stolen goods, fences often played additional roles in the criminal underground of early China. Inns and teahouses often became ideal places for banditries and gangs to gather in order to exchange information and plan for their next crime. Harborers, people who provided safe houses for criminals, often played the role of a fence as well, in receiving stolen goods from their harboured criminals to sell to other customers. Safe houses also included brothels and opium dens, as well as gambling parlors, and employees or owners of such institutions often functioned as harborers, as well as fences. These safe houses were located in places where there was a high floating population and people from a great variety of social backgrounds interacted. Brothels also helped bandits to hide and sell stolen goods because of the special Ming Law that exempted brothels from being held responsible ‚Äúfor the criminal actions of their clients.‚Äù Although the government required brothel owners to report any suspicious activity, the lack of government enforcement as well as the motivation of owners to make an extra income from fencing led brothels to become an ideal safe house for bandits and gangs. Pawnshops were also often affiliated with fencing stolen goods. The owners or employees of such shops often paid a low sum far below market value for stolen goods to bandits, and resold the goods to earn a profit. Punishment Two different Ming Laws, the Da Ming L√º Â§ßÊòéÂæã and the Da Gao Â§ßËØ∞, drafted by the Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, sentenced fences to different penalties based on the category and value of the products that were stolen. In coastal regions, illegal trading with foreigners, as well as smuggling became a huge concern for the government during the mid to late Ming era. To prohibit this crime, the government passed a law in which illegal smugglers who traded with foreigners without the consent of the government would be punished with exile to the border for military service. In areas where military troops were stationed, stealing and selling military property would result in more severe punishment. In the Jiaqing time, a case was recorded of a robber stealing and selling military horses. The emperor himself gave orders that the thieves who had stolen the horses and the people who had helped to sell the horses would be put on a cangue and sent to labour in a border military camp. In the salt mines, the penalty for workers who stole and/or sold salt was the most severe. Because of the enormous value of salt in Ming China, anyone who was arrested and found guilty of stealing and selling government salt was put to death. Approach Car stereo thieves typically want to sell stolen items quickly. By selling to fences, they avoid the hassle and suspicion of selling directly to the final buyers. Fencing is often conducted through legal businesses. Some fences maintain a legitimate-seeming \\"front\\" through which they can sell stolen merchandise. Depending on the type of stolen merchandise a fence deals in, \\"front\\" businesses might be discount stores, used goods stores, a coin and gem store, auction house, flea market, or auto salvage yards. The degree of illicit activity in each \\"front\\" business may differ from fence to fence. While one fence's salvage yard may consist mainly of stolen auto parts, another fence's used goods store might consist mainly of legitimately purchased used goods, with the stolen merchandise acting as a minor, but profitable, sideline. Thieves agree to this because their alternatives may present a greater risk of the thief being caught. As well, selling stolen goods takes a great deal of time and effort (transaction costs), as the thief would have to try to contact a number of potential buyers and show them the merchandise. Some habitual thieves are so well known to police that if the thief were to attempt to sell any used goods, this would quickly draw the attention of law enforcement. The fence then disguises the stolen nature of the goods, if possible, so that he or she can sell them closer to the market price. Depending on the stolen item, the fence may attempt to remove, deface, or replace serial numbers on the stolen item before reselling it. In some cases, fences will transport the stolen items to a different city to sell them, because this lessens the likelihood that the items will be recognised. For some types of stolen goods, fences disassemble the good and sell the individual parts, because the sale of parts is less risky. For example, a stolen car or bicycle may be disassembled so that the parts can be sold individually. Another tactic used by some fences is to retain stolen items for some time before selling them, which lessens the likelihood that the burglary victims or police will be actively looking for the items in auctions and pawnshops. The prices fences pay thieves typically depend both on norms and on legitimate market rates for the items in question. Vulnerable sellers, such as drug addicts or casual thieves, may receive less than 20% of an item's value. Higher prices, sometimes as high as 50% of an item's value in a legal market, can be commanded by a professional thief, especially one who concentrates on valuable items. At the same time, fences will often take advantage of thieves by deceiving them about the value of an individual item and the relevant market conditions. For example, a fence may falsely tell a petty thief that the market for the type of good which the thief is selling is flooded with this type of merchandise, to justify paying out a lower price. There are a number of different types of fences. One way of categorising fences is by the type of good in which they trade, such as jewels, power tools, or electronics. Another way of categorising fences is by their level of involvement in buying and selling stolen goods; for some, fencing is an occasional \\"sideline\\" activity, while it is an economic mainstay for others. At the lowest level, a hustler or drug dealer may occasionally accept stolen goods. At the highest level would be a fence whose main criminal income comes from buying and selling stolen items. At the broadest level, two tiers of fences can be distinguished. The lower level of fences are those who directly buy stolen goods from thieves and burglars. At a higher level are the \\"master fences\\", who do not deal with street-level thieves, but only with other fences. Research on fences shows that they view themselves as entrepreneurs, relying on networking with and patronage by prominent criminals to become successful in their word-of-mouth-based \\"wheeling and dealing\\". They occupy the middle ground between the criminal world (thieves, burglars and shoplifters) and the legitimate world (e.g., everyday people who purchase used goods). Some active fences go farther in their business, maintaining longstanding contacts and even teaching thieves how to practice their craft, whether by identifying specific products or by teaching them tools of the trade. The degree to which the purchasers of the stolen goods know or suspect that the items are stolen varies. If a purchaser buys a high-quality item for a low price, in cash, from a stranger at a bar or from the back of a van, there is a higher likelihood that the items may be stolen. On the other hand, if a purchaser buys the same high-quality item for the standard retail price from a used goods store, and obtains a proper receipt, the purchaser may reasonably believe that the item is not stolen (even if, in fact, it is a stolen item).  E-fencing  Stores have complained that increasingly, shoplifters are stealing goods with the intent of selling them anonymously online. In this photo, a store loss- prevention officer scans the security cameras for shoplifters. E-fencing is the sale of items on the Internet that have been obtained illegally. Besides the involvement of the Internet, there are some other key differences when discussing activities that have come to be thought of as \\"e-fencing\\" compared to \\"traditional\\" fencing that should be understood. The common elements to both are that fraudulently obtained goods and/or services are being bought and sold in a (series of) transactions(s) involving a minimum of three distinct parties. In traditional fencing these parties are usually understood to be the thief who stole the goods, (a) fence(s) who act(s) as (an) intermediary(ies) and the final purchaser, with only the final purchaser (possibly) being the innocent and unwitting party. On the other hand, e-fencing is also used frequently to describe transactions where there is some direct interaction between the original thief and the final purchaser - in a typical such case, the \\"intermediary\\" is an online platform, but when discussing e-fencing (unlike traditional fencing) the level of culpability on the part of the \\"intermediary\\" platform varies greatly. On one hand, the platform's operators may be knowingly or recklessly permitting such activity (such as is typically the case with a darknet market) and thus might be thought of as a \\"fence\\" in a more traditional sense. At the other extreme are \\"intermediaies\\" that are legitimate and respected platforms being used in defiance of their terms and conditions and in spite of aggressive and ongoing actions to interdict such illegal activities. E-fencing is an activity that criminals often mix with sales to pawnbrokers. The auction website eBay, being easy to reach for the average thief, is a popular location for e-fencing; customers reported more than eight thousand crimes from the website in 2008, many of which involved the sale of stolen property.11 April 2009. EBay: brisk bidding in stolen goods. business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article6074448.ece Classified websites like Craigslist, AutoTrader.com, Pennysaver online, etc. are some of the Internet sources used for fencing goods online and circumventing the middleman fencer, in addition to a number of illegal darknet markets. E-fenced items may be shoplifted or otherwise stolen, alternatively they may be purchased using stolen credit cards or similar banking information. The latter practice is often intertwined with carding, which is the trafficking of thousands or even millions of stolen credit card numbers. The sale of stolen credit cards, which usually takes place on the darknet markets, is generally considered to be a form of e-fencing in its own right, and often plays a role in supplying the data used to purchase physical goods that may be either e-fenced themselves or fenced through more traditional means. Crime rings steal and/or use stolen financial information to pay for in-demand items from retailers and then sell them online, relying on the Internet's ability to reach buyers around the world and its anonymity; some theft rings even take pre-orders, confident that they can steal and/or fraudulently pay for whatever is currently in demand. In the United States, major retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target have advocated for federal legislation to combat Internet fencing. Proposals for such legislation have often proposed requiring major sales websites (e.g. eBay and Amazon.com) to retain some items' serial numbers and to release information to retailers about major sellers whom the retailers believe to be relying on stolen property. Such proposals have been opposed by the online retailers who would be required to maintain these records and take these actions.Spencer, Jim. \\"Target, other stores battle theft rings fencing stolen goods on Web\\". Minneapolis Star Tribune. Accessed 24 June 2011 In addition to physical goods, stolen financial information can also be e-fenced by using such data to purchase intangible goods and services on behalf of unsuspecting buyers. In some cases, criminals anonymously pose as agents selling items such as airline tickets at significantly discounted prices, while they are actually using stolen financial information to purchase such goods and services at the regular price from legitimate websites using the real identity of the final purchaser. Such criminals often request payment in cryptocurrency such as bitcoin to further cover their tracks. Once the fraud is discovered, it is usually the final purchaser(s) who will be held liable for the full amount of the purchase(s), and possibly even be at risk of criminal prosecution themselves depending on the jurisdiction. One airline representative described the practice as being \\"akin to buying a television set in a bar.\\" Rankin, Eric \\"Air Canada imposes 'no fly' ban, demands $18K from woman after ticket scam\\" CBC News Accessed 4 June 2019 An eBay spokesman has stated, \\"Perhaps the dumbest place to try to fence stolen materials is on eBay,\\" and news agencies have reported incidents of the police purchasing stolen property directly from thieves, leading to their capture.Online auctions are the newest place to hawk stolen goods By early 2007, e-fencing had become a $37 billion business. Legal aspects Fencing is illegal almost everywhere, usually under a similar rationale as in the United States, where receipt of stolen property is a crime in every state, as well as a federal crime if the property crossed a state line. Occasionally federal agents will temporarily set up a false fence sting operation. Fencing is a common source of income for organised crime. In England and Wales, as in many US states, the crime requires three elements: stolen property, the receiver's act of receiving or hiding it, and his knowledge of its stolen status. Pawnbrokers have often been associated with fencing, though in many jurisdictions, government identification must be shown in order to pawn an item and police regularly check pawnshops for stolen goods and repossess any stolen items. While pawnbrokers do not like this characterisation of their business, police efforts have indicated that some pawnbrokers are involved in fencing.Warner, Bill. \\"No Questions Asked: Sarasota Pawn Shop Businesses Charged in Sting Operation, Black-Market Fencing Easy Cash For Burglars & Armed Robbers.\\" 25 April 2011. http://www.zimbio.com/Crime,+Background+Checks,+Foul- Play,+Fraud+And+Investigations/articles/JFXTKyZc6TE/No+Questions+Asked+Sarasota+Pawn+Shop+Businesses Accessed on 24 June 2011.

Early life and academic career  Arno J. Mayer was born into a middle-class family in Luxembourg on 19 June 1926. His father was a wholesaler who had studied at the University of Heidelberg and had strong social democratic and Zionist beliefs. Mayer described his family as \\"fully emancipated and largely acculturated Luxembourgian Jews\\". The family fled into France amid the German invasion on 10 May 1940 and reached the France‚ÄìSpain border by Autumn 1940 but were turned back by Spanish border guards and were in the Vichy-controlled \\"Free Zone\\" after the Fall of France. The family succeeded in boarding a ship to Oran in French Algeria on 18 October 1940 but were prevented from entering Morocco because they lacked a visa and spent several weeks under house arrest in Oudja. They secured visas for the United States on 22 November 1940 and arrived in New York in January 1941. His maternal grandparents who had refused to leave Luxembourg were deported to the Theresienstadt Ghetto where his grandfather died in December 1943. Mayer became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1944 and enlisted in the United States Army. He served as an intelligence officer and eventually became a morale officer for high-ranking German prisoners of war. He was discharged in 1946. He received his education at the City College of New York, the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva and Yale University. He has been professor at Wesleyan University (1952‚Äì53), Brandeis University (1954‚Äì58) and Harvard University (1958‚Äì61). He has taught at Princeton University since 1961.  Views  A self-proclaimed \\"left dissident Marxist\\", Mayer's major interests are in modernization theory and what he calls \\"The Thirty Years' Crisis\\" between 1914 and 1945.. Mayer posits that Europe was characterized in the 19th century by a rapid modernization in the economic field by industrialization and retardation in the political field. He has argued that what he refers to as \\"The Thirty Years' Crisis\\" was caused by the problems of a dynamic new society produced by industrialization facing a rigid political order. He feels that the aristocracy in all of the European countries held far too much power, and it was their efforts to keep power that led to World War I, the rise of fascism, World War II, and the Holocaust. In a 1967 essay \\"The Primacy of Domestic Politics\\", Mayer made a Primat der Innenpolitik (\\"primacy of domestic politics\\") argument for the origins of World War I. Mayer rejected the traditional Primat der Au√üenpolitik (\\"primacy of foreign politics\\") argument of traditional diplomatic history on the grounds that it failed to take into account that in Mayer's opinion, all of the major European countries were in a \\"revolutionary situation\\" in 1914, and thus ignores what Mayer considers to be the crucial impact that domestic politics had on foreign-policy making elites.. In Mayer's opinion, in 1914, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was on the verge of civil war and massive industrial unrest, Italy had been rocked by the Red Week of June 1914, the French Left and Right were waging a war to the death with each other, Germany was faced with ever-increasing political strife, Russia was facing a huge strike wave, and Austria-Hungary was confronted with rising ethnic and class tensions.. Mayer insists that liberalism and centrist ideologies in general were disintegrating in face of the challenge from the extreme right in the UK, France and Italy while being a non-existent force in Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia.. Mayer ended his essay by arguing that World War I should be best understood as a pre-emptive \\"counterrevolutionary\\" strike by ruling elites in Europe to preserve their power by distracting public attention onto foreign affairs.. Mayer argued in his Politics and Diplomacy of Peacemaking (1967), which won the American Historical Association's 1968 Herbert Baxter Adams Prize,. that the Paris Peace Conference was a struggle between what he called the \\"Old Diplomacy\\" of the alliance system, secret treaties and brutal power politics and the \\"New Diplomacy\\" as represented by Vladimir Lenin's Decree on Peace of 1917 and Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which Mayer sees as promoting peaceful and rational diplomacy. He described the world of 1919 as divided between the \\"forces of movement\\", representing liberal and left-wing forces, behind the \\"New Diplomacy\\" and the \\"forces of order\\", representing conservative and reactionary forces, behind the \\"Old Diplomacy\\".. Mayer sees all foreign policy as basically a projection of domestic politics, and much of his writing on international relations is devoted towards explaining just what domestic lobby was exerting the most influence on foreign policy at that particular moment of time.. In Mayer's view, the \\"New Diplomacy\\", associated with Lenin and Wilson, was associated with Russia and America, both societies that Mayer has argued either had destroyed or lacked the partial \\"modernized\\" societies that characterized the rest of Europe. He sees the United States' diplomacy at Versailles as an attempt to establish a \\"new\\", but \\"counter-revolutionary\\" style of diplomacy against \\"revolutionary\\" Soviet diplomacy. In Mayer's view, the greatest failure of the Treaty of Versailles was that it was a triumph for the \\"Old Diplomacy\\" with a thin \\"New Diplomacy\\" veneer. According to Mayer, the irrational fears generated by the Russian Revolution led to an international system designed to contain the Soviet Union. A major influence on Mayer is the British historian E. H. Carr, who was his friend and mentor. In 1961, Mayer played a key role in the American publication of Carr's book What Is History?. Many of Mayer's writings on international affairs in the interwar era take as their starting point Carr's 1939 book The Twenty Year's Crisis. In his 1981 book, The Persistence of the Old Regime, Mayer argued that there was an \\"umbilical cord\\" linking all the events of European history from 1914 to 1945. In Mayer's opinion, World War I was proof that, \\"[t]hough losing ground to the forces of industrial capitalism, the forces of the old order were still sufficiently willful and powerful to resist and slow down the course of history, if necessary by recourse to violence.\\". Mayer argued that because of its ownership of the majority of the land in Europe and because the middle class were divided and politically undeveloped, the nobility continued as the dominant class in Europe. Mayer argued that faced with the challenge of a world in which they had lost their function, the aristocracy both embraced and promoted reactionary beliefs such as those of Friedrich Nietzsche and Social Darwinism, together with a belief in dictatorship and fascist dictatorship in particular. In Mayer's view, \\"It would take two world wars and the Holocaust [‚Ä¶] finally to dislodge the feudal and aristocratic presumption from Europe's civil and political societies.\\" In his 1988 book Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? Mayer argues that Adolf Hitler ordered the Final Solution in December 1941 in response to the realisation that the Wehrmacht could not take Moscow, hence ensuring Nazi Germany's defeat at the hands of the Soviet Union.. Given Baldwin's errant opinion (p. 36) that Goldhagen and others were probably right in criticizing Mayer's view about the timing of the decision to launch the Holocaust, it is worth noting that Mayer's alighting upon December 1941 as the decisive month is in agreement with serious Holocaust scholarship. See, for example, : \\"Hitler probably finalized his decision in December [1941]\\". In Mayer's opinion, the Judeocide (Mayer's preferred term for the Holocaust) was the horrific climax of the \\"Thirty Years' Crisis\\" that had been raging in Europe since 1914.. The book views the Holocaust as primarily an expression of anti-communism: > Anti-Semitism did not play a decisive or even significant role in the growth > of the Nazi movement and electorate. The appeals of Nazism were many and > complex. People rallied to a syncretic creed of ultra-nationalism, Social > Darwinism, anti-Marxism, anti-bolshevism, and anti-Semitism, as well as to a > party program calling for the revision of Versailles, the repeal of > reparations, the curb of industrial capitalism, and the establishment of a > v√∂lkisch welfare state.. Mayer stated that one purpose of his in writing Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? was to put an end to a \\"cult of remembrance\\" that, in his view, had \\"become overly sectarian\\".. Mayer has often accused Israel of exploiting the memory of the Holocaust to further its foreign policy objectives. In his opinion, Hitler's war was first and foremost against the Soviets, not the Jews. According to Mayer, the original German plan was to defeat the Soviet Union, and then to deport all the Soviet Jews to a reservation behind the Urals.. In regards to the functionalist-intentionalist divide that once pervaded Holocaust historiography, Mayer's work can be seen as a bridge between the two schools.. Mayer argues that there was no masterplan for genocide, and that the Holocaust cannot be explained solely in regards to Hitler's world view. At the same time, Mayer does agree with intentionalist historians such as Andreas Hillgruber (with whom Mayer otherwise has little in common) in seeing Operation Barbarossa, and the Nazi crusade to annihilate \\"Judeo-Bolshevism\\" as the key development in the genesis of the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\".  Critical responses to Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?  Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? was met with hostile reviews. The British historian Richard J. Evans, in summing up their reviews of the book, noted that some of their more \\"printable\\" responses included: \\"a mockery of memory and history\\" and \\"bizarre and perverse\\".. Two prominent critics of Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? were Daniel Goldhagen and Lucy Dawidowicz. Both questioned Mayer's account of the murder of Jews during the early phases of World War II, arguing the organized and systemic role played by the Nazis was much greater. Both accused Mayer of attempting to rationalize the Holocaust, comparing him to the right-wing historian Ernst Nolte... The American historian Peter Baldwin considered that Goldhagen had missed Mayer's overall point about the connection between the war against the Soviet Union and the Holocaust, while Guttenplan described their \\"distortion\\" of Mayer's views as \\"disgraceful\\", going on to note that > Arno Mayer's book opens with \\"A Personal Preface\\" telling of his own hair- > raising escape from Luxembourg and occupied France, and of the fate of his > grandfather, who refused to leave Luxembourg and died in Theresienstadt. > Such personal bona fides didn't prevent the Anti-Defamation League from > including Mayer in its 1993 \\"Hitler's Apologists: The Anti-Semitic > Propaganda of Holocaust Revisionism\\", where his work is cited as an example > of \\"legitimate historical scholarship which relativizes the genocide of the > Jews.\\" Mayer's crime is to \\"have argued, with no apparent anti-Semitic > motivation\\"‚Äînote how the absence of evidence itself becomes > incriminating‚Äî\\"that though millions of Jews were killed during WWII, there > was actually no premeditated policy for this destruction.\\". Reviewers criticized Mayer's account of the Holocaust as focused too heavily on Nazi anti-communism at the expense of a focus on antisemitism.. Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer alleged that > when a Holocaust survivor such as Arno J. Mayer of Princeton University ... > popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in Marxism and bolshevism their > main enemy, and the Jews unfortunately got caught up in this; when he links > the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of German warfare in the > Soviet Union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need > a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a much more subtle > form of Holocaust denial. He in effect denies the motivation for murder and > flies in the face of well-known documentation.. Much of the controversy around Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? was due to the simple fact that through this book the general public first learned of the functionalist view that there was no masterplan for the Holocaust going back to the days when Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.. Another area of controversy centered on what Robert Jan van Pelt called Mayer's \\"well-meant but ill- considered reflection on the causes of death in Auschwitz\\". Mayer concluded his reflection as follows: \\"certainly at Auschwitz, but probably overall, more Jews were killed by so-called 'natural' causes than by 'unnatural' ones.\\" This conclusion removed the lingering restraints‚Äîif any actually remained‚Äîpreventing David Irving from publicly announcing he did not believe the gas chambers at Nazi camps like Auschwitz existed.. Guttenplan called Mayer's musing on differences between 'natural' and 'unnatural' deaths, even if the terms were deployed in quote marks, \\"indefensible\\".. Holocaust deniers have often quoted out of context Mayer's sentences in the book: \\"Sources for the study of the gas chambers are at once rare and unreliable\\".. As the authors Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman have noted, the entire paragraph from which the sentence comes from states that the SS destroyed the majority of the documention relating to the operation of the gas chambers in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the gas chambers are \\"rare\\" and \\"unreliable\\"..  Since 2001  Mayer has been critical of the policies of the United States government. In 2001, after the September 11 attacks, he wrote an essay stating that \\"since 1947 America has been the chief and pioneering perpetrator of 'preemptive' state terror, exclusively in the Third World and therefore widely dissembled.\\" When interviewed for a 2003 documentary, he described the Roman Empire as a \\"tea party\\" in comparison to its American counterpart. Mayer's book, Plowshares into Swords (2008) is an anti-Zionist and pro-Palestinian account of Israeli history, tracing what Mayer regards as the degradation of Jewry in general and Zionism in particular in face of what Mayer sees as Israeli colonial aggression against the Palestinians. In a largely favorable review, the British writer Geoffrey Wheatcroft called Plowshares into Swords an enlightening account of Israeli history that traces such figures as Martin Buber, Judah Magnes, Yeshayahu Leibowitz and, perhaps unexpectedly, Vladimir Jabotinsky and critiques the \\"chauvinistic and brutalising tendencies of Zionism\\". In a negative review of the book, British scholar Simon Goldhill said it was of little value as history and criticized Mayer for his political bias, arguing that Mayer ignored Arab acts and media rhetoric against Jewish settlers and Israelis, falsely portrayed the Six-Day War in 1967 as a \\"calculated imperialist plot\\", claimed that all Western criticism of the Islamic world for human rights issues is nothing more than self-interested and described Arab feeling toward Jews buying property in Palestine in the 1920s as \\"righteous anger\\".

It was released for the Virtual Boy on March 22, 1996 in North America. Players control multiple falling blocks, rotating and positioning them to clear layers in a three-dimensional environment similar to Tetriss gameplay. The game contains multiple modes and variations thereof, as well as different difficulty settings and levels. Parts of 3D Tetris are rendered as 3D wire-frame models. A version of the game entitled was to be released in February 1996 in Japanese markets, but never emerged. The game received mostly negative reviews with critics panning it for a lack of originality. Gameplay alt=The bottom left corner of the screenshot shows a block with a face and limbs, and the gameplay field is displayed in a combination of solid graphics and wire-frames, the latter which represents blocks still falling. On the right side, a two-dimensional view of the gameplay is shown. 3D Tetris is a puzzle game that uses a three-dimensional playing field as opposed to the traditional two dimensions used in most other versions of Tetris. The play field, called a well, contains 5 vertical layers that players fill with falling three-dimensional blocks. These blocks can be rotated horizontally and vertically, as well as positioned in four different directions. Each block displays a shadow underneath it which indicates where it will land. The game's camera continually adjusts itself, but players can manually readjust it. The HUD displays a radar which provides information about each of the well's five layers, as well as the next block to fall, which is represented by a character. The game contains multiple different modes: 3-D Tetris, Center- Fill, and Puzzle, each having variations in how they play. Players can modify the difficulty in these modes as well as the rate by which the blocks fall. In the 3-D Tetris mode, a layer disappears when it's filled with blocks, scoring players points which are displayed in the HUD. If blocks stack over the top of the well, the number of layers will go down by one. The game is over when the final layer is lost. One game mode is based on accumulating points, while the other mode requires players to complete multiple levels by clearing all five layers in each. In the Center-Fill mode, players place blocks in symmetrical patterns around center blocks placed in each well's layers. If a block is placed in a layer's center block, it disappears, and any other blocks in the layer will also disappear if they have been successfully placed in a symmetrical pattern. Points are gained based on the number of blocks in, the complexity of, and the height of the symmetrical layer. A symmetrical pattern is indicated by a symbol shown in the HUD's radar, as well as the player's score. Like the 3-D Tetris mode, layers will be lost if the blocks go over the top of the well, and the game ends when all layers are lost. One variant requires players to complete as many layers as possible, while the other is the same except with obstacles added. The variant Clear It! requires players to clear ten symmetrical layers on each stage to progress to the next stage. In the Puzzle mode, a shape is displayed in the well at the beginning of each stage. Players are tasked with getting to the highest stage possible by placing blocks in the displayed shape to progress to the next stage. At the end of each stage, a stage-ending animation is displayed. If an incorrect shape is placed, the game ends. 3D Tetris includes an option to save high scores and names entered from the 3-D Tetris and Center-Fill modes, along with progress in the Puzzle mode, to a battery backup. Development and release 3D Tetris was developed by T&E; Soft and published by Nintendo in North America. A version was planned for Japanese markets entitled Polygo Block, which was to be released in February 1996, but was never released. Like all other Virtual Boy games, 3D Tetris uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses parallax, an optical trick that is used to simulate a 3D effect. The game contains 30 different block types, and renders each one as a 3D wire-frame model until they fall to the bottom of the well, where they are filled in. It was the last game released on the Virtual Boy in North America. Reception 3D Tetris received mostly negative reviews. Aaron Curtiss, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said that 3D Tetris adds nothing to the Tetris experience and leaves players feeling \\"cheated.\\" He criticized the control scheme and brushed off the 3D effects as superfluous. Staff for Entertainment Weekly had even harsher criticism, criticizing it as \\"eye-straining\\" and comparing it unfavorably to the video game Blockout. A reviewer for Next Generation panned the game, feeling that it demonstrates the inherent issues of the Virtual Boy. He found all of the different game modes to be poor reworkings of the Tetris concept, lacking the series' \\"simple elegance\\" while being harmed by the 3D perspective. A reviewer for the magazine VideoGames also found that the game was less appealing than Tetris due to the 3D perspective, though felt that the perspective did have value and was executed well. GamePros \\"Scary Larry\\" found the sound and visuals nondescript and the controls frustrating, though he still felt it was addictive. Staff for Game Informer felt the idea of a 3D Tetris had potential, but it was not executed well, criticizing its slow pace. A writer for Nintendo Power felt its button configurations were user-friendly and made it \\"easy to master.\\" In a retrospective review, USgamer writer Jaz Rignall was highly critical, comparing it to getting pepper sprayed. GamesRadar+ editor Brett Elston felt that 3D Tetris visuals were \\"appalling\\" and found it hard to tell what was happening as a result. Echoing Entertainment Weekly, writer Jeremy Parish found it to be a knockoff of Blockout; he criticized its visuals and gameplay for failing to find a middleground between too complex and too slow.

Dempster batted and threw right-handed. He was both a starter and a reliever, in his career. On April 22, 2014, Dempster was hired by MLB Network as a studio color analyst. Professional career =Draft and minor leagues= He was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 3rd round of the 1995 MLB draft and began his career with the Gulf Coast Rangers. He subsequently played for the Hudson Valley Renegades, the Kane County Cougars and the Charleston RiverDogs. =Florida Marlins (1998‚Äì2002)= Dempster was traded to the Florida Marlins on August 8, 1996 (with Rick Helling) for John Burkett. Dempster made his MLB debut for the Marlins, working two innings of relief, on May 23, 1998 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, allowing three earned runs on two hits in that game. He later made his first start on June 1 against the Chicago Cubs, lasting only 1 1/3 innings as he was shelled for five runs while allowing 4 hits (including 2 home runs) and walking 3, to record his first career loss. After falling to 0‚Äì3 he got his first Major League win on June 28 against the Boston Red Sox, when he allowed only 1 run in 7 innings. He was 1‚Äì5 with a 7.08 ERA in 14 appearances (11 starts) that season. In 1999, Dempster started 25 games and finished 7‚Äì8 with a 4.71 ERA. In 2000, Dempster was 13‚Äì10 with a 3.66 ERA in 33 starts, including 2 complete games and 1 shutout. On May 7, 2000, he tossed a one-hitter against the New York Mets.

In 2002, he made 18 starts for the Marlins and was 5‚Äì8 with a 4.79 ERA. =Cincinnati Reds (2002‚Äì2003)= On July 11, 2002, The Marlins traded Dempster to the Cincinnati Reds for Juan Encarnaci√≥n, Wilton Guerrero and Ryan Snare. In 15 starts the second half of the season, he was 5‚Äì5 with a 6.19 ERA. In the 2003 season, he made 20 starts (and 2 relief appearances) and was 3-7 with a 6.54 ERA. In August 2003, he underwent Tommy John surgery on his right elbow and missed the rest of the season. =Chicago Cubs (2004‚Äì2012)= After his release by the Reds, he signed as a free agent with the Chicago Cubs on January 21, 2004. After rehabbing from his surgery, he joined the Cubs on August 1 and appeared in 23 games, all out of the bullpen. He picked up his first MLB career save on September 15, 2004 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In , after starting 6 games, Dempster was named the closer for the Cubs, replacing LaTroy Hawkins. He collected 33 saves in 35 opportunities, the best save percentage in the league; in both blown saves, he collected the win. He is the only Cub and one of just three players ever to both start a game and collect 30 saves in the same season. On October 1, 2005, the Cubs signed him through 2008 in a US$15.5 million contract extension. Chicago Cubs in April 2007 He emerged as one of the team's most consistent relievers in . At one point, Lou Piniella, the Cubs' manager, was considering promoting Dempster to a starting pitcher. However, the idea was short lived, as a struggling bullpen forced Dempster to remain as closer. He recorded 16 saves in 18 opportunities before missing two weeks of playtime on account of an injured oblique muscle. During 2008 spring training, Dempster's performance resulted in his being designated to the third spot on the starting rotation, with the closer job going to Kerry Wood. On April 3, 2008, he earned his first win as a home starter since a 2002 win with the Marlins against the Cubs.Rough inning doesn't doom Dempster ‚Äì ChicagoSports.com On May 15, 2008, Dempster recorded a career high 12 strikeouts in a game. He pitched 8rd innings, and gave up only 6 hits. On July 8, 2008 he became the first Cubs pitcher in 31 seasons to start 10‚Äì0 at home. Dempster finished the season with 17‚Äì6 record, with 2.96 ERA and 183 strikeouts in 201 and 2/3 innings. Dempster threw sliders 32.9% of the time in 2008, more than any other NL starting pitcher.

He led the majors in sacrifice hits, with 19. Following the 2008 season, Dempster re- signed with the Cubs for four years and a reported $52 million. In May 2009 MLB indicated that the Commissioner's Office would review Dempster's up-and-in pitch to Milwaukee Brewers slugger Ryan Braun. Cubs manager Lou Piniella commented, \\"You've got to tie Braun up from time to time. If you don't, he's going to feast on you.\\" After reviewing the tapes, however, Major League Baseball found no wrongdoing on Dempster's part, and decided not to take any action against him. Dempster finished the season with a 3.65 ERA and a record of 11‚Äì9 in 31 starts. In 2010, he was 15‚Äì12 with a 3.85 ERA in 34 starts and in 2011 he was 10‚Äì14 with a 4.80 ERA in 34 starts. =Texas Rangers (2012)= On July 31, 2012 Dempster was traded to Texas at the trade deadline, for minor leaguers Christian Villanueva and Kyle Hendricks.

He is tied for the most regular season grand slams allowed (11) with Kenny Rogers. Dempster has also allowed one in the postseason, for a grand total of 12. On August 18, 2013, in a game against the rival New York Yankees, Dempster was involved in a contentious incident with Alex Rodriguez. The first time he faced Rodriguez, he threw one pitch behind him, then subsequently, Dempster's 3‚Äì0 pitch struck Rodriguez on the left elbow pad and ricocheted off his back. Although home plate umpire Brian O'Nora warned Dempster and both dugouts, Dempster was allowed to stay in the game. Later, in the top of the 6th inning, Dempster gave up a home run to Rodriguez and the Red Sox lost the game 9-6. On August 20, MLB gave Dempster a five-game suspension (though he did not miss a start) and an undisclosed fine for hitting Rodriguez. For a couple of years following the incident, Dempster claimed he did not mean to hit Rodriguez then finally admitted in August 2016 the incident was, indeed, intentional. Dempster finished the 2013 season at 8‚Äì9 with a 4.57 ERA in 32 games (29 starts). He was part of the 25-man active roster for the postseason making 3 relief appearances and won his first championship title when the Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2013 World Series. =Retirement= On February 16, 2014, Dempster announced he would not pitch in 2014, stating that he wanted to spend some time with his family. The Red Sox placed Dempster on the restricted list for the 2014 season. His salary for 2014 was $13.25 million, but was never paid or granted due to his absence. On October 8, 2014, Dempster announced his retirement. On December 5, it was announced that Dempster would be taking a job in the Cubs' front office as an assistant to general manager Jed Hoyer and president of baseball operations Theo Epstein. In January 2017, Dempster indicated he would pitch for Team Canada in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. He started two games for Canada in the Classic, pitching a total of only 2‚Öì innings while giving up 7 earned runs. Pitching style Dempster threw five pitches with some regularity: a four-seam fastball and two-seam fastball averaging about 90 mph, a cut fastball in the high 80s, a slider in the mid 80s, and a splitter in the low 80s. Dempster favored his slider over his splitter when throwing to right- handed hitters and often imparted an obvious, prolonged wiggle to his glove as part of his windup, a move he claims is done in order to prevent tipping opposing batters to his pitches. Personal life Dempster is widely known for his laid-back attitude, constantly joking with fans and teammates, and is said to be a positive contribution to a team's clubhouse. Dempster's fun and easy-going personality was especially evident when, in comments to an Arizona newspaper in March 2007, Dempster stated that if his career as a closer began to tumble, he would pursue ninja training. In early June 2009, Dempster released a statement explaining that his daughter, Riley Dempster, had DiGeorge Syndrome, also known as Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and Shprintzen syndrome (after Dr. Robert Shprintzen who identified it in 1978). About 1 baby in 1800 is born with this genetic deletion which ubiquitously affects swallowing, breathing, and speech. Dempster did this because he wanted to help raise awareness of this genetic disease. When asked if she would lead a normal life, he replied, \\"Yeah, she will. There can be (problems), but so far all the signs are good. There's a lot of work to do. They say there are 186 symptoms you can have. You just check off ones as you go along.\\" After roughly 2 months in the hospital, Riley was able to go home in early June.\\"Chicago Cubs' Ryan Dempster and infant daughter fight rare disease\\".

Together with his brother-in-law, Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, Director influenced some of the next generation of jurists, including Robert Bork, Richard Posner, Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Early life Director was born in Staryi Chortoryisk, Volhynian Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine) on September 21, 1901. In 1913, he and his family immigrated to the United States, and settled in Portland, Oregon. In Portland, Director attended Lincoln High School where he edited the yearbook. Director had a difficult childhood in Portland, then a center of KKK and anti-communist hysteria in the wake of World War I. He encountered anti-Semitic slurs and was excluded from social circles. He then moved east to attend Yale University in Connecticut, where his friend, artist Mark Rothko also attended. He graduated in 1924 after three years of study. While at Yale, Director was influenced by Thorstein Veblen and H.L. Mencken, both elitist academics who believed the public lacked the intelligence to make democracy successful, and he eventually came to hold these views as well. He and Rothko anonymously published a satirical newspaper called the Saturday Evening Pest in which he wrote ‚Äúthe definition of the United States shall eternally be H. L. Mencken surrounded by 112,000,000 morons‚Äù and called for an \\"aristocracy of the mentally alert and curious. In 1926, he returned to Portland where he was hired to run and teach at the Portland Labor College. As a radical, his invitations to Communists and Wobblies created friction with the AFL craft unions which sponsored the College. In working with these radical groups, Director developed his sense that individuals, especially elites were better equipped to affect social change than government. The fall of 1927 he entered Graduate School at the University of Chicago with a fellow-ship,\\"\\"Two Lucky People\\" University of Chicago Press 1998 where he combined his radicalism to a lifelong conservative ideology. His sister, the economist Rose Director Friedman, married Milton Friedman in 1938. During World War II, he held positions in the War Department and the Department of Commerce. Academic life Nobel laureate Austrian economist and political theorist Friedrich Hayek, who was then a professor of economics at Chicago, was close to Director. They met in England and Director convinced the University of Chicago Press to publish Hayek's Road to Serfdom in the United States as part of the so-called Free Market Study which they and economist Henry Simons led. Hayek actively promoted Director in helping to fund and establish the Law and Society program in the Law School. Hayek convinced Missouri businessman Harold Luhnow, head of the Volker Fund, a foundation in Kansas City, to provide the funding. Luhnow also funded Director's University of Chicago salary for five years, a rare occurrence for the university. At the University of Chicago, Director completed his transition to conservative corporatist. The Free Market Study had at first centered on Simons's traditional conservative antimonopoly politics, but his death in 1946 opened the door for a more radical conservatism. In 1950, Director still held some of Simons's economic philosophy, and as a result, Lunhow threatened to remove him from the Free Market Study. During this period of the 1940s and 1950s, Director broke away from traditional conservative politics, instead combining it with the social skepticism he had learned from Thorstein and Veblen and the elitism he developed in Portland. Director's appointment to the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1946 began a half-century of intellectual productivity, although his reluctance about publishing left few writings behind. Director taught antitrust courses at the law school with Edward Levi, who was later Dean of Chicago's Law School, President of the University of Chicago, and U.S. Attorney General in the Ford administration. In 1953, Director became the head of a new study called the Antitrust Project which aimed to restructure American antitrust law. The project coincided with the period in which Director broke from traditional conservative ideas and fused them with the elitism of Veblen and Mencken. He argued that private monopolies only emerged as a result of government action, without which, they would cease to be a problem. This shift helped turn the focus of the Chicago school of economics towards rebuilding corporate power. Director used a two-part strategy to help build up the Chicago school. First, he recruited scholars as well as funding for their research. Second, he had them use Mencken's framework of mocking targets as ignorant and elitist. Two of the first converts to Director's neoliberal school were Friedman and George Stigler, scholars from the older, classically liberal Chicago conservative tradition. Friedman and Stigler were still anti- monopolist, but over the course of the 1950s, Director convinced them that monopolies would cease to be a problem under the neoliberal framework. From then on, Director served as the \\"ideological enforcer\\" of the new Chicago school with Friedman crafting the rhetoric and Stigler driving the economic vision. Through Director's Chicago school framework, scholars like Friedman and Stigler made their first advances into public-policy advocacy Director's greatest contribution to the Chicago school lay in his ability to recruit and convert scholars to the school's neoliberal doctrine. Some of his students compared taking his antitrust or economics courses to a religious conversion with Nobel laureate Ronald Coase joking that ‚ÄúI regarded my role as that of Saint Paul to Aaron Director‚Äôs Christ. He got the doctrine going, and what I had to do was bring it to the gentiles.\\" Rather than penning the great works of the Chicago school himself, he was, according to former University of Chicago Law School dean Paul Baird \\"a teacher of teachers.\\" Director founded the Journal of Law & Economics in 1958, which he co-edited with Coase, that helped to unite the fields of law and economics with far-reaching influence. In 1962, he helped to found the Committee on a Free Society. Behind the law and economics movement lay the narrative of scientific consensus. The Chicago school was not the first group to show interest in empirical economics but they used the language of science as a strong rhetorical tool. Director viewed human nature deterministically so he argued that the law could be replaced by the scientific principles of economics through efficiency measurements. The work of Director and his students fundamentally altered public discourse around issues of economics. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said of those who opposed the reforms of the New Deal \\"their number is negligible and they are stupid\\" By 1964, Director students including Robert Bork were working on Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign. At that time, the Chicago school was not yet the dominant force in political discourse, but in ten years, it had gone from being \\"negligible\\" to being a significant opposition to the majority. In 1973, Bork was appointed as Solicitor General of the United States by President Richard Nixon. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court had begun striking down antitrust legal precedents. In just two decades, Director and his students had brought the Chicago school from obscurity to a major intellectual force in American politics. After retiring from the University of Chicago Law School in 1965, Director relocated to California and took a position at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. He died September 11, 2004, at his home in Los Altos Hills, California, ten days shy of his 103rd birthday.

It lies within the metropolitan borough of South Tyneside, roughly halfway between South Shields and Sunderland, in the ceremonial county of Tyne and Wear. Historically part of County Durham, the village has a population of 5,235.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Urban Areas : Table KS01 : Usual Resident Population Retrieved 26 August 2009 Etymology The origin of the name is not entirely clear. While the \\"Whit\\" component almost certainly derives from the Old English word hwit meaning \\"white\\", the origin of the \\"burn\\" component is disputed. It may come from the Northern English term burn meaning a stream, or it may be a corruption of \\"barn\\". A record of the name as Wituberne in 1182 adds little clarity. A brief history Whitburn is listed in the \\"Boldon buke\\" of 1183 as \\"Whitbern\\" and was probably an Anglo-Saxon settlement. Following the attack of the Spanish Armada on England in 1588, the vanquished Spanish fleet fled up the east coasts of England and Scotland. Two Spanish galleons ran aground on Whitburn Rocks in rough seas and local inhabitants plundered the wreckage. The bell from one of the galleons was placed in Whitburn Church. Spanish oak beams removed from the shipwrecks could still be viewed in the roof of the Whitburn lawnmower shop in the 1950s prior to the building's demolition. Whitburn remained fairly undisturbed settlement until 1718 when the Land Enclosure Act came into force and a number of farms were created. The settlement was isolated as no roads connected to it, but there was a path on Sea Lane (now East Street) connecting it to Whitburn Bents, a nearby hamlet. Not until 1866 was a road built over the sandunes to Fulwell, in northern Sunderland. In 1874 Marsden Pit was sunk and the community increased dramatically as a result. Whitburn Colliery closed in 1968, and the land is now a coastal park and nature reserve.Whitburn Features Whitburn has retained its village character, with its main street, parish church, cricket ground and park with bowling greens and tennis courts. It is generally accepted that Lewis Carroll wrote The Walrus and the Carpenter while holidaying at his cousins' house in Whitburn.BBC ‚Äì Wear ‚Äì Coast ‚Äì Point 7 ‚Äì The Carroll connection A statue of Carroll is in the library.British Society for the History of Mathematics Whitburn windmill, looking out to sea. Whitburn windmill, dating from the 18th century, is a local landmark. Durham County Council, which covered the South Tyneside area until 1974, took ownership of the mill in 1960 from the Church Commissioners. The building is listed (Grade II) as it is considered to be of special architectural and historical importance and is protected therefore by the requirements of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. In 1991/1992 South Tyneside Council undertook a restoration project of the mill, including restoration of the sails, for which it was awarded the Civic Trust Award. There are three schools in Whitburn ‚Äì Whitburn Village Primary School, Marsden Primary School and Whitburn Church of England Academy (formerly Whitburn Comprehensive School). To the north of the village, near Marsden village, is Whitburn Coastal Park, near which is cared for by the National Trust team based at the Souter Lighthouse. This recreation area is a popular haunt for birdwatchers. A sea-watching observatory is used mainly by Durham Bird Club members, who monitor seabird and wildfowl migration throughout the year (activity peaks during July‚ÄìNovember), but is open to all bird-watchers. Keys (¬£12) can be bought at the National Trust shop at Souter Lighthouse but the observatory is normally in use whenever seabird and wildfowl passage is in progress which means it can be accessed by bird- watchers without keys. Whitburn is one of the premier sites on the east coast of England for seawatching with notable list of rarities to its name. A good variety of cetaceans are also seen from here, particularly in late summer. There were three public houses in Whitburn. The Grey Horse (now closed) on North Guards, the Jolly Sailor on Front Street and the Whitburn Lodge (closed) on the Coast Road which used to be part of the former Whitburn Colliery buildings.

Marie, Ontario, Canada. The mill was situated on the St. Marys River waterfront, just east of Algoma Steel. History =Formation= The pulp mill was originally established as the \\"Sault Ste. Marie Pulp and Paper Company\\" in 1895 by Francis Clergue. It was located on the site of a Northwest Company trading post that was established in 1874. Clergue also incorporated the \\"Ontario Pulp and Paper Company\\" to operate a parallel mill for newsprint production. Following the collapse of the Clergue industrial empire in 1903, it closed for several months before being operated in receivership until 1905. The Clergue companies became part of the Lake Superior Corporation in 1904,authorized by and which arranged for the transfer of the assets of the Sault Ste. Marie Pulp and Paper Company to the Lake Superior Paper Company Ltd. in 1911. Lake Superior Paper amalgamated with Spanish River Pulp & Paper Mills in 1917, which operated the mill until the Abitibi Power and Paper Company purchased it in 1928. The mill was acquired by St Marys Paper Inc. from Abitibi in 1984, for which loan guarantees were secured from the Government of Canada. St Marys Paper was controlled by a private investor, Dan Alexander, who arranged to invest heavily in a fifth paper machine. =Operation= St. Mary's Paper operated a supercalendar grade paper mill with three paper machines, with a total annual capacity of 240,000 tons. It produced SCA premium, SCA and SCB paper grades under the trade names Sequence, Sequel and Synpress. Paper produced at the mill was primarily purchased by magazine publishers and large retail companies for high quality advertising inserts, flyers and catalogues. =Hard times and restructurings= St Mary's Paper, in common with the rest of the pulp and paper industry in Canada, had been facing many adverse economic factors in recent years, arising from international economic trends, provincial policies and changing technology. This resulted in three successive restructurings between 1993 and 2012: :* The company declared bankruptcy in April 1993 and was operated for several years by Ernst & Young. Belgravia Investments purchased the mill in 1994 and made the facility viable with the assistance of the employees, the Ontario government and the Toronto-Dominion Bank. :* In October 2006, it filed for bankruptcy protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in Toronto. In June 2007, the mill was reopened under new ownership and began making paper again for its customers in the United States. However, pensioners saw their benefits reduced by 20%. In order to assure operations, St. Mary's entered into financing, supply and exclusive distribution agreements with International Forest Products. :* Despite these efforts, which also included $25 million in startup funding from IFP and the Government of Ontario, the mill was unable to resume significant activity, and went idle once more in 2011. In December 2011, IFP applied to place the company into receivership, and a bankruptcy order was subsequently issued in June 2012. E&Y;, acting as trustee in bankruptcy, reported that the realization of funds from the sale of assets would be insufficient to pay off liabilities due to the secured creditors. Acting as receiver, it proceeded to sell off all assets. =Site redevelopment= In 2013, the site was purchased by Riversedge Developments, a real estate developer which announced plans to convert the site into a mixed-use cultural and tourism hub through adaptive reuse of the most historically and architecturally significant buildings. Dubbed Mill Square, current plans for the site include the new home of the Algoma Conservatory of Music, a performance and arts venue, a bioenergy plant and Destination North, a cultural and tourism \\"hub\\" project that will incorporate interactive museum exhibits, a farmer's market and a new terminus for the Agawa Canyon Railway tour. The main building now houses a restaurant (The Mill Steak House), 2 pubs (The Boiler Room and The Steamfitter's Lounge), and a gelato/coffee shop (The Gelato Mill), along with the performance venue and conservatory. The facility is branded as The Machine Shop. In 2015, parts of the area were purchased by The Tech including The Yard (outdoor music venue) and The Yard Locker.

Unlike the jump shot, it is shot with only one hand; the other arm is often used to create space between the shooter and the defensive player. The shot is quite difficult to block, but few players have mastered the shot more than a few feet from the basket. The hook shot was reportedly performed for the first time in official games in Eurobasket 1937 by Pranas Talz≈´nas, a member of the eventual champions, the Lithuania basketball team. Former Harlem Globetrotter Goose Tatum is often credited with inventing the hook shot; he even shot them without looking at the basket. The hook shot later became a staple of many players in the National Basketball Association, including notable stars such as George Mikan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, and Yao Ming. In FIBA games, hook shots were a favored skill for centers before dunks became more popular, mostly because of the relative difficulty of blocking such shots. Skyhook NBA Hall of Famer George Mikan developed a devastating hook shot while playing for DePaul University in the mid-1940s, as did Jerry Lucas playing for Ohio State 15 years later. The hook shot became a trademark of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the National Basketball Association's all-time leading scorer, who was proficient at the shot at a much greater distance from the basket than most players. The greater distance and resulting higher arc on the shot led to the name skyhook, which was coined during Abdul-Jabbar's tenure with the Milwaukee Bucks by the team's radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, who felt that \\"that hook was so high that it was coming out of the sky\\". The skyhook was rarely blocked, and it was accomplished by only a few players like Wilt Chamberlain and Manute Bol. Magic Johnson used a similar shooting technique during the 1987 NBA Finals, which he called his \\"baby hook\\" in deference to teammate Abdul-Jabbar. Jump hook Due to the increasingly physical nature of low post basketball, the \\"jump hook\\" has become a more popular style of hook shot, and has been employed by many players including centers Shaquille O'Neal and Dwight Howard. The player jumps off using two feet, instead of taking steps and then jumping off using one foot. The jump hook provides for better balance as well as a quicker release, though the shot will not be released from as high in the air. According to Hakeem Olajuwon, it is a \\"necessary shot that every center should have\\", because it is very difficult to block. Former #1 pick in the 1962 NBA draft, Billy \\"The Hill\\" McGill, was known for using the jump hook shot in both his college and pro careers. See also captain for the 2018‚Äì19 Michigan Wolverines as a junior, Zavier Simpson earned the nickname \\"Captain Hook\\" for making use of the hook shot. *Basketball moves References  External links  *Sky Hook A Variant of Hook Shot *Baby Hook A Variant of Hook Shot * Category:Basketball terminology Category:Jumping sports ","title":"Hook shot"},{"id":"1922440","text":"Wallace Glenn Wilkinson (December 12, 1941 ‚Äì July 5, 2002) was an American businessman and politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1987 to 1991, he served as the state's 57th governor. Wilkinson dropped out of college at the University of Kentucky in 1962 to attend to a book retail business he started. The business rapidly became a national success, and Wilkinson re- invested his profits in real estate, farming, transportation, banking, coal, and construction ventures, becoming extremely wealthy. In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After running behind two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant James Carville. Wilkinson campaigned on a promise of no new taxes and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state. Wilkinson surprised most political observers by winning the primary and going on to defeat his Republican challenger in the general election. Wilkinson was able to secure passage of a constitutional amendment allowing a state lottery. He also helped craft a significant education reform bill in response to a ruling by the Kentucky Supreme Court that declared the state's entire public school system unconstitutional. Wilkinson's term was plagued by political scandal and an uneasy relationship with the state legislature. He advocated an amendment to the state constitution that would allow him to seek a second consecutive term as governor, but the amendment was defeated in the General Assembly. His wife Martha attempted to succeed him, but withdrew from the campaign amid weak support for her candidacy. Following his term as governor, Wilkinson encountered difficult financial times. In 2001, he was sued by a group of creditors, and during the proceedings, it was revealed that he was operating a Ponzi scheme to keep his businesses afloat. Both he and his wife Martha filed for bankruptcy later that year. In 2002, Wilkinson was hospitalized with arterial blockages. His condition was complicated by a recurrence of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002, and his family withdrew his life support the following day in accordance with his previously-expressed wishes. Early life Wallace Wilkinson was born on a farm in Casey County, Kentucky, about southwest of the city of Liberty, on December 12, 1941.Jordan, \\"Wilkinson Wants His Name Better Known\\" The son of Hershel and Cleo (Lay) Wilkinson, he had two older brothers and a younger sister.Wagar, Miller, and Honeycutt, \\"Building a Million-Dollar Empire\\" His parents were farmers and also operated a small general store. When Wilkinson was four years old, the family moved to Liberty, and the family opened Wilkinson's Grocery. During his childhood, he delivered newspapers, sold popcorn from a street stand, and co-owned a shoe shine parlor with a boyhood friend. He also accompanied his father to sell produce from the back of a truck. It was during one such trip that he met Martha Carol Stafford, whose parents owned a grocery store about away. The two dated throughout high school and were married in 1960. They had two children: Wallace Glenn Wilkinson, Jr. (b. 1970) and Andrew Stafford Wilkinson (b. 1972). Wilkinson was a member of the freshman basketball team at Liberty High School. Using profits from his early business ventures, he purchased a business wardrobe that earned him the title of best dressed member of his senior class. He graduated from high school in 1959, but the poor curriculum there left him without the credits he needed to gain admission to the University of Kentucky's engineering program. He began selling livestock feed in Scottsville, Kentucky, and also worked at a venetian blind factory while taking classes at Campbellsville College to earn the credits he needed. In 1962, he moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and enrolled at the University of Kentucky. While in college, he worked at Kennedy Book Store in Lexington.Mead, \\"Man Who Covets Privacy Has Grown More Public\\" Later, he and two friends borrowed money to open the Kentucky Paperback Gallery in Lexington; Wilkinson left school later that year to attend to the business full-time.\\"Kentucky Governor Wallace G. Wilkinson\\". National Governors Association At the time, Kentucky high school students were required to purchase their own textbooks, but there was no marketplace for buying and selling used books; Wilkinson's business catered to this market and was highly successful.  Business ventures  Wilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local stockbroker helped him raise the initial capital needed through a public stock offering. By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation at the behest of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned to selling college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state sales tax on his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should have been paying the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and none of the three were required to pay any back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms.Adams, p. 238Cross, p. 956 In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing the ads, and agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers. With the success of his chain of bookstores, Wilkinson pursued other business ventures in the fields of real estate development, farming, transportation, banking, coal interests, and construction. He purchased several private aircraft to help him tend to his diverse interests throughout the state, and in 1973, created Wilkinson Flying Service to keep the planes busy when he wasn't using them.Wagar, Miller, and Honeycutt, \\"Wilkinson 'Works Smart' to Expand Wealth\\" After investing in the unfinished Bluegrass Commerce Center in Lexington in early 1977, he purchased one-third interest in the Purcell building on Lexington's Vine Street later that year. The building was only partially occupied, but had become more valuable because of the opening of nearby Rupp Arena in October 1976 and a new Hyatt hotel in May 1977. Developers Donald and Dudley Webb developed plans to construct the Vine Center on the block; by May 1979, they had options to buy every property on the block except Wilkinson's interest in the Purcell building. Unwilling to meet Wilkinson's asking price, they instead formed a partnership with him to co-develop the Vine Center. When Wilkinson eventually sold his interest in the venture at the end of 1981, he turned a profit of at least $1.3 million on his investment. Next, he formed a public-private partnership with the city of Lexington to construct the Capital Plaza Hotel in 1983. The city provided $3 million in capital and another $8.5 million in guaranteed loans to supplement Wilkinson's $1.15 million investment. Wallace's Book Stores was given 95% ownership in the hotel, allowing the company to shield $2 million in assets from federal income taxes and claim over $400,000 in tax credits. Despite playing a major role in the Lexington real estate market, Wilkinson was fiercely protective of his privacy; for a time, he even refused to allow newspapers to publish pictures of him. His public profile began to rise when he announced plans to construct the 50-story World Coal Center on the corner of Main and Limestone streets in Lexington. When completed, it would be the largest office complex between Atlanta and Chicago. Wilkinson hoped that all the major coal companies in the state would relocate their offices to the center, making it a hub for the international coal market.Noland, p. 70 Shortly after Wilkinson demolished the historic Phoenix Hotel to make way for the building, the coal market experienced a pronounced lull, and the empty lot where the proposed coal center would have stood was derided as \\"Wally's Folly\\" and \\"Lake Wilkinson\\".Duke, \\"'Lake Wilkinson' will be Replaced by Temporary Park\\" In 1984, the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government secured a lease from Wilkinson to develop a temporary municipal park on the site. Wilkinson conceded that he would not be able to develop the proposed World Coal Center in the near-term, and Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler wanted to improve the property before the city hosted the finals of the 1985 NCAA men's basketball tournament at Rupp Arena. In early 1985, Wilkinson struck a deal with the state and urban county governments to retain the park and build a public library and parking garage while allowing Wilkinson to construct and operate a 21-story apartment complex above the garage.Duke, \\"Downtown Project Receives State Backing\\" Critics claimed that the city-county government bailed Wilkinson out of a bad investment by purchasing the property from him and by giving him a government-subsidized, low interest rate on his $12 million mortgage for the apartment building. Alleged kidnapping by Jerome Jernigan On April 10, 1984, Wilkinson was allegedly kidnapped by a man named Jerome Jernigan.\\"Jernigan Found Dead in Motel\\". Daily News In 1977, Wilkinson had provided Jernigan with start-up money for Jernigan Export Timber, Inc., a company that manufactured and exported wood veneers internationally.Roser and Anderson, \\"Jernigan Known as Entrepreneur\\" The company went defunct around the time of Jernigan's divorce from his wife, the secretary-treasurer of the company, in December 1980. Jernigan's son, Victor, continued to work for Wilkinson in another capacity until 1982. According to Wilkinson, in the months leading up to the alleged kidnapping, Jernigan had come to Wilkinson's office several times demanding money he claimed he was owed from his prior business dealings with Wilkinson.\\"Kidnapping Suspect to Face Charges in Louisville\\". Lexington Herald-Leader Wilkinson said he had been making the requested payments, but that when he refused Jernigan's request on April 10, Jernigan presented him with a four-page suicide note, then produced a pistol and told Wilkinson, \\"I'm going to kill you first.\\" Wilkinson further alleged that Jernigan forced him to drive to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Frankfort, a hotel Wilkinson owned, at gunpoint. The two spent the night at the hotel, and sometime during the night, Wilkinson contacted James Aldridge, president of New Farmers National Bank in Glasgow, Kentucky.Tolliver, \\"Businessman Sues Wilkinson for $50 Million\\" Wilkinson, who owned an interest in New Farmers National Bank, told Aldridge he needed $500,000 as soon as possible. The next day, Wilkinson and Jernigan flew to Glasgow aboard a plane operated by Wilkinson Flying Service, another company owned by Wilkinson. Wilkinson said Jernigan threatened to kill employees at the company if Wilkinson attempted to alert them. Aldridge met Wilkinson and Jernigan with the money Wilkinson had requested at the Glasgow Municipal Airport. Upon their arrival, Wilkinson paid Jernigan $500,000 and was released unharmed. After his release, Wilkinson alerted the FBI, and Jernigan was arrested the same day in Lexington. Upon his arrest, he was in possession of two pistols, six sets of handcuffs, and $400,000 in cash. Jernigan told authorities that he and Wilkinson had spent the previous night at the Crowne Plaza negotiating a settlement to their differences stemming from their earlier business relationship. The terms of the settlement, Jernigan maintained, included a $500,000 cash payment from Wilkinson, part of which would finance a new business venture similar to Jernigan's previous veneer export business. Wilkinson would also furnish Jernigan with a car, a furnished apartment in Lexington, and a salary of $5,000 a month. Jernigan stated that after the $500,000 was paid, Wilkinson decided to back out of the settlement and portray the encounter as a crime. Wilkinson denied Jernigan's allegations and maintained that the money ‚Äì which was later recovered ‚Äì was demanded by Jernigan as a ransom for his release. Weeks later, Jernigan filed a counter-suit against Wilkinson in Fayette County circuit court. He asked the court to award him $50 million in punitive damages and to determine the profits made by his and Wilkinson's veneer company, of which he would receive half. A judge ordered the case moved to Louisville because the alleged crime was committed in Glasgow, in the state's western district. State charges against Jernigan, which included kidnapping and carrying a concealed deadly weapon, were dropped so that the federal extortion charges could take precedence. Over the objection of his legal counsel, the court ordered Jernigan to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was insane or mentally incompetent for his own defense.Tolliver, \\"Accused Kidnapper Ruled Fit for Trial\\" The court-appointed psychiatrist found Jernigan competent to stand trial, and he was released in late May on a $25,000 bond. After his release on bond, Jernigan returned to the room at the Continental Inn in Lexington where he had been living prior to his arrest.Duke, \\"Heart Disease Found in Jernigan Autopsy\\" On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.Tolliver, \\"Wilkinson Wins Bid to Dismiss Late Ex-Partner's $50 Million Suit\\" Political life After announcing his plans for the World Coal Center, Wilkinson began attending meetings of the Lexington Urban City Council, where he advocated his fiscally conservative political views. He was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, although he said he wished Reagan was a Democrat like himself. In 1979, Wilkinson became involved with Terry McBrayer's campaign against John Y. Brown, Jr. in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. He held a critical fundraiser for Scotty Baesler's 1981 Lexington mayoral campaign, although most of the businessmen in Lexington favored Baesler's opponent.Wagar, Miller, and Honeycutt, \\"Wilkinson Applies Zest for Success to Politics\\" In the 1983 Democratic gubernatorial primary, he served as finance chairman for Harvey Sloane's campaign. When Sloane lost a close race to Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins, Republican nominee Jim Bunning tried to enlist the support of Sloane and his supporters, including Wilkinson.Osbourne, \\"Bunning Camp Trying to Coax Sloane Supporters to Its Side\\" After a month of consideration, however, Wilkinson endorsed the entire Democratic ticket.Brammer, \\"Sloane Announces He Will Support Collins\\" The following year, he managed former governor Brown's brief senatorial campaign. Already considering running for governor in 1987, Wilkinson had hoped to remove Brown as a potential competitor for that office by helping him get elected to the Senate, but Brown ended his campaign early for health reasons. Through his work in various the campaigns, Wilkinson found that he enjoyed the challenges of competing in the political arena. He lobbied the General Assembly to pass a multi-bank holding company bill allowing banking companies to own more than one Kentucky bank. The bill passed in 1984. =Democratic primary of 1987= In April 1985, Wilkinson formed a campaign committee in advance of the 1987 gubernatorial election.\\"Group to Aid Beshear in Campaign Set Up\\". Lexington Herald-Leader Relatively unknown statewide, Wilkinson was the first candidate to enter the race. The Democratic primary field eventually grew to include two previous Kentucky governors, John Y. Brown, Jr. and Julian Carroll; sitting Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, who would later win two terms as governor in 2007 and 2011; and Grady Stumbo, cabinet secretary for Governor Martha Layne Collins. Early in the race, Brown was the clear-cut favorite, while Wilkinson was picked to finish fifth.\\"Kentucky Nominee an Instant Favorite\\". The Washington PostPeterson, \\"Newcomer Defeats Ex-Gov. Brown in Kentucky Gubernatorial Upset\\" Wilkinson financed his own campaign and campaign manager Danny Briscoe suggested that he hire a campaign consultant to reach out to the state's large concentration of undecided voters. After a few interviews, Wilkinson hired a then-unknown political consultant named James Carville; Carville later went on to chair Bill Clinton's successful presidential campaign in 1992. Happy Chandler's endorsement boosted Wilkinson's candidacy. Beshear, considered the second strongest candidate in the primary race, spent much of the campaign attacking Brown, and Brown spent time and resources responding to Beshear's attacks.Dionne, \\"Upset in Democratic Primary\\" Meanwhile, Wilkinson attacked all of his opponents in the race as political insiders while touting his own rise from poverty to financial success. He called the incentive package that sitting governor Martha Layne Collins had offered to lure a Toyota manufacturing plant to the state \\"a massive mistake and terrible deal\\" that had made Kentucky \\"an international laughingstock\\". He also claimed that both Brown and Beshear would raise taxes and proposed a state lottery, which he claimed would generate $70 million annually for the state's coffers, as an alternative to higher taxes. The proposal proved particularly popular in Northern Kentucky, where residents routinely traveled to neighboring Ohio to play that state's lottery. Wilkinson also advocated for wholesale education reform, stating that Kentucky's children \\"don't have a learning problem; they've got a schooling problem.\\" Two-time former governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler gave Wilkinson's campaign further credibility with his endorsement. In late April, Brown still held a 20 percentage point lead in public opinion polling. However, as Beshear began to slip in the polls, Wilkinson moved up. By Memorial Day weekend, he was polling second among the candidates. Brown largely ignored Wilkinson until a week before the election, when he began running ads questioning the amount of money Wilkinson claimed would be generated by a state lottery. Wilkinson won the primary, garnering 36 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Brown, 18 percent for Beshear, 12 percent for Stumbo, and 6 percent for Carroll. In total, Wilkinson spent a record $4 million during the primary campaign. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark opined that Wilkinson's lavish spending during the campaign prompted the legislature to adopt campaign finance reform measures. =Gubernatorial campaign of 1987= Democrats enjoyed a 3-to-1 voter registration advantage in Kentucky, and while he had been the underdog in the primary campaign, Wilkinson became the heavy favorite against the Republican nominee, State Representative John Harper of Shepherdsville. Larry Forgy, who had been groomed for the Republican nomination, unexpectedly dropped out of the race before the primary, leaving the party at a significant disadvantage with a largely unknown and underfunded candidate.Peterson, \\"Kentucky, Mississippi Pick Democrats for Governor\\" While Harper began his general election campaign immediately, Wilkinson made few public appearances ‚Äì except for fundraisers ‚Äì until the second week in September.Rugely, \\"Wilkinson And Harper Pick Up Campaign Pace\\" He also refused to endorse the $125 million education reform measure that sitting governor Martha Layne Collins had guided through the legislature in 1985, which cost him the endorsement of the Kentucky Education Association.Roser, \\"KEA Support for Harper Likely to Aid Underdog\\" The association endorsed Harper, marking the first time in its history it had endorsed a Republican gubernatorial candidate, but endorsed Brereton Jones, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor.Rugely, \\"KEA Makes it Official, Supports Harper\\" Harper attacked Wilkinson's lottery proposal as \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" economics. In addition, Harper's campaign raised a number of ethical issues with regard to Wilkinson's business dealings.Peterson, \\"Democrats Favored to Win Governorships in Kentucky and Mississippi\\" Gary Stafford, Wilkinson's brother- in-law who was serving as president of Wallace's Book Store, pleaded guilty to illegal wiretapping and rolling back the odometers on company vehicles. The company was also forced to pay $44,641 in back taxes. Further, Republican state chairman Bob Gable questioned whether Wilkinson had helped Italian businessmen circumvent laws that made it difficult to export Italian currency by disguising real estate ventures as legitimate business transactions with Jernigan Export Timber.Miller, \\"Wilkinson's Business Dealings Questioned\\" Gable also hired a private investigator who determined that there was \\"substantial reason\\" to suspect that foul play was involved in the death of Wilkinson's business partner, Jerome Jernigan. Despite Gable's allegations and the investigator's findings, Lexington police officials said they saw no reason to re-open the investigation.Honeycutt, \\"Foul Play in Jernigan Death Seen as Unlikely\\" Harper was at a substantial fundraising disadvantage, raising only $225,000 for the entire campaign compared to Wilkinson's $8 million.Rugely, \\"Low Turnout, Other Factors Temper Wilkinson Victory\\" This left him unable to purchase enough media time to solidify any of the ethical questions about Wilkinson in the voters' minds. Wilkinson's campaign also delved into Harper's personal life, admitting that it tipped off the media about Harper's son, who had been shot to death in an attempted burglary.Schwartz, \\"Kentucky's Campaign Derby\\" In the general election, Wilkinson defeated Harper by a vote of 504,674 to 273,141. By capturing 65% of the vote, he broke Julian Carroll's record of 62.8%. Low voter turnout prohibited him from setting the record for most votes received by a candidate in a Kentucky gubernatorial election, and he received several thousand fewer votes than Brereton Jones, the victorious Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. He carried 115 of Kentucky's 120 counties ‚Äì besting Carroll's old record of 99 ‚Äì but lost in Fayette, his county of residence. A poll conducted by a Louisville television station after the election showed that 76% of voters wished they had another candidate to vote for. =Legislative session of 1988= Even before he officially took office, some of Wilkinson's public comments set up an adversarial relationship with the General Assembly. Just two days after his election, he told reporters that he would exert the \\"full power\\" of his office toward getting his agenda approved by the legislature and that he \\"conceive of a situation\\" where he would use his political action committee (PAC), Kentuckians for a Better Future, to help defeat legislators who opposed him.Holwerk, \\"Take a Deep Breath and Count to 10, Governor-Elect\\" Under governors Brown and Collins, the legislature had become increasingly independent of the governor, and Lexington Herald-Leader reporters opined that House Speaker Don Blandford and Senate President Pro Tem John \\"Eck\\" Rose would be reluctant to cede power back to the chief executive. During the 1988 legislative session, Rose introduced a bill setting a limit of $4,000 on the amount PACs could contribute to an individual's campaigns during a single election and a limit of $2,000 on the amount any individual could contribute to a single PAC in a given election.Brammer and Rugely, \\"New Set of Kentucky Laws Takes Hold Friday\\" A month later, Wilkinson recanted, saying he \\"misspoke\\" and only intended to use his PAC to promote passage of the lottery amendment.Rugely, \\"Wilkinson Says He Won't Use PAC to Fight Opponents in Legislature\\" Despite the governor's promise, the legislature passed Rose's bill. Tensions also developed between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor-Elect Jones soon after the election.Rugely, \\"Wilkinson and Jones' Compatibility May Be an Issue\\" During the campaign, Jones was quoted as saying that he had talked with Wilkinson about being more open with the press and said that, if elected, he would not be a \\"yes man\\" for Wilkinson. At a press conference shortly after the election, Wilkinson said he did not know what role Jones would play in his administration and that much of it would depend on what Jones had meant when he said he did not agree with all of Wilkinson's positions. In late November 1987, Wilkinson announced that Jones would spearhead the promotion of the administration's agricultural agenda.\\"Jones to Play Role in Promoting Farm Programs\\". Lexington Herald-Leader The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that this would not be Jones' primary role in the administration but that no other specifics had been provided. Although amendments removing Kentucky's constitutional prohibition on a state lottery had been introduced in every legislative session since the mid-1970s, Wilkinson's election provided the issue with fresh momentum, and the General Assembly passed the amendment by the required majorities in the 1988 session.\\"Southern Baptists, United Methodists Unite to Oppose Approval of Lottery for Kentucky\\". Lexington Herald-LeaderHarrison, p. 420 Another amendment passed during Wilkinson's term required landowner approval before strip mining could occur on a piece of property. This amendment essentially overturned a 1956 court ruling and negated the practice of issuing broad form deeds which allowed property owners to sell their mineral rights while retaining ownership of structures and other improvements above-ground. A third amendment for which Wilkinson advocated would have allowed elected state officials to succeed themselves in office. During his gubernatorial campaign, he insisted that he would not seek to have such an amendment apply to himself, but shortly after his election, he reversed course and insisted on an amendment that did not exclude present incumbents.Rugely, \\"Succession Measure Dies in Senate Committee\\" The amendment became one of Wilkinson's top priorities in the 1988 legislative session, and he threatened to work against legislators who opposed it. Legislators proposed that a succession amendment include provisions to lengthen the terms of state legislators to maintain a balance of power between the executive and legislative branches; Wilkinson insisted that the General Assembly pass a \\"clean\\" succession amendment, free from any other provisions that might diminish the amendment's chances of being approved by the state's voters. The Kentucky House of Representatives passed such an amendment, but the state Senate continued to press for legislative concessions, proposing annual legislative sessions and mandatory runoffs in gubernatorial primaries when one candidate did not receive a majority of the votes cast. When Wilkinson rejected both proposals, Senate leaders refused to bring the amendment to the floor for a vote. Wilkinson's reversal on his campaign promise not to seek succession for present incumbents damaged his reputation. Wilkinson's advocacy for the amendment further damaged his relationship with Lieutenant Governor Jones because Jones had already announced his intention to run for governor in 1991.Rugely, \\"Wilkinson, Jones Tiff Points Up Tense Ties\\" After the session, Jones told a crowd in Owensboro that if Wilkinson called a special session to insist that legislators pass his educational agenda, that the General Assembly would probably \\"throw it back in his face\\". In response, Wilkinson said that Jones should \\"be involved in improving the process, not be so negative about everything\\" and \\"pay attention to his own business\\". A Lexington Herald-Leader story noted that a promised news conference to elaborate on Jones' role in the administration had not yet happened and that \\"[m]ost observers expect it never will\\". The two men's relationship continued to be strained throughout their terms; Jones later described it as \\"terrible\\".Miller, p. 7 =Creation of the Kentucky Lottery= Leaders of the Southern Baptists and United Methodists led opposition to the amendment during Wilkinson's administration, activating the Coalition Against a State Lottery. Despite the opposition, Kentucky voters approved the lottery amendment by a vote of 694,577 to 446,937 in the November 1988 elections.Brammer and Miller, \\"Lottery Spending Plans Rejected as Special Session Starts\\" Days after the election, Wilkinson signed a proclamation calling a special legislative session to begin November 28 to pass legislation to implement the lottery.Brammer and Miller, \\"Wilkinson Calls Session on Lottery\\" The call instructed the legislature to consider a bill based on the recommendations of Wilkinson's lottery commission. The recommendations included the establishment of a lottery board whose president and members would be appointed by the governor and could only be removed by the governor, and earmarked the first year's proceeds to be split evenly between early childhood education programs, programs for the elderly, and a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. Legislators insisted on more legislative control of the lottery and did not favor explicit earmarks for the proceeds, preferring to allocate them in the 1990 legislative session. They also objected to the lottery board's exemption from open records and open meetings laws. Immediately after the session convened, Democratic leadership in both houses of the General Assembly announced they would not support earmarking lottery funds, but would let them accumulate in escrow until the 1990 legislative session. On December 14, legislators adjourned the session after passing a bill that created an eight-member lottery board, headed by a president appointed by the governor and confirmed by the other seven members.Rugely and Brammer, \\"General Assembly OKs Bill on Lottery\\" The other seven members of the board would serve staggered terms, would be appointed by the governor, and be confirmed by the Senate. The legislation also escrowed proceeds until the 1990 General Assembly and specified that the first expenditures from those proceeds would fund a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. The vote on the legislation was 32‚Äì5 in the Senate and 92‚Äì6 in the House. Several Republican amendments, including one by Senator David L. Williams to implement a local option for counties to decide whether or not to sell lottery tickets, were defeated on party-line votes. While the legislation did not implement all of Wilkinson's proposals for the lottery, he nonetheless praised it as a \\"very good\\" bill. =Education reform= A lawsuit to reform Kentucky's educational system began under Wilkinson's predecessor, Martha Layne Collins On May 31, 1988, Franklin County circuit court judge Ray Corns issued a ruling in the case of Council for Better Education v. Collins, et al. stating that Kentucky's system of school financing was unconstitutional.Dove, p. 21 The suit was brought against Wilkinson's predecessor, Martha Layne Collins, and several members of the state government by a group of poor school districts as a means to equalize funding for all the state's school districts. An advocate for education, Wilkinson dropped the governor's office's defense in the suit and joined the plaintiffs when Corns' decision was appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court.Dove, p. 22 On appeal, the Supreme Court declared Kentucky's entire public school system unconstitutional and mandated that the legislature reform it. Although state legislators maintained that reforming the public school system was too large an issue to tackle during the 60-day legislative session of 1990 and requested that Wilkinson call a special legislative session in June 1990 to consider the issue, the governor insisted that the issue be resolved during the regular session and said that he would not allow consideration of tax increases to fund improvements in the system if he had to call a special session.Lawrence, \\"Taxes, Education Divide Governor, Wary Lawmakers\\" Wilkinson presented a budget proposal to the General Assembly that contained measures increasing taxes on cigarettes and corporations and eliminating sales tax exemptions on legal, engineering, and advertising services.Miller, \\"Wilkinson Calls for $1 Billion More in Taxes\\" Legislators favored raising the sales tax to six percent instead. For much of the legislative session, Wilkinson remained steadfastly opposed to an increased sales tax, repeatedly calling it a \\"dead issue\\" and threatening to veto it.Geiger and Stroud, \\"Wilkinson Agrees to Sales-Tax Increase\\" Then on March 9, 1990, Wilkinson announced that he would drop his opposition to the tax in exchange for the Assembly's approval of a $600 million bond issue to finance road improvements he had promised during the campaign. The Lexington Herald- Leader called the move \\"a stunning reversal\\" and noted that Wilkinson would not comment on why he changed his mind. With the impasse between the legislature and Wilkinson resolved, House Speaker Don Blandford announced that the remainder of the session would focus only on approving the state budget and passing the court-mandated education reforms; any bills still in committees would not be brought to a vote, he said.Miller, \\"Blandford: Session Must Focus on School Reform\\" On April 11, 1990, the Assembly passed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) to comply with the Supreme Court's decision.Dove, p. 25 Besides increasing funding for schools, it mandated high performance measures and held schools accountable for meeting them. Educators hailed the legislation as being among the nation's best education reform plans. Even after KERA was passed, disagreements between Wilkinson and the legislature continued. The $600 million bond issue for road construction that had been the price for Wilkinson's support of the sales tax was modified to include language that allowed the legislature to determine where the roads were constructed.Brammer, \\"Wilkinson Lets Road Bond Measure Become Law Without His Signature\\" Wilkinson threatened to veto the measure, claiming he did not need the General Assembly's approval to issue the bonds, but ultimately, he chose to allow it to become law without his signature. Wilkinson vetoed 21 bills passed by the legislature, but 13 of those vetoes were overridden; it was the most gubernatorial vetoes overridden in a single session in modern times.Miller and Brammer, \\"Legislature Overrides 13 Vetoes\\" Most of the overridden vetoes were on bills strengthening the legislative branch relative to the executive branch. The General Assembly also voted to send two proposed constitutional amendments that strengthened the legislative branch relative to the executive to voters for ratification.Straub, \\"Legislature Makes Grab for More Power\\" One allowed the legislature to call itself into session ‚Äì a power constitutionally reserved for the governor ‚Äì if two-thirds of its members signed a petition to do so. The other allowed a committee of legislators to suspend regulations enacted by the executive branch between legislative sessions until the full legislature re-convened. Through his political action committee, Wilkinson opposed both measures, and both were rejected by the state's voters in the November 1990 elections.Wade, \\"Three of Four Amendments Defeated\\" The political debates and posturing leading up to the passing of KERA also permanently breached the relationship between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor Jones. During a teachers' rally in Frankfort, Jones was sympathetic to their demands for more money for education than Wilkinson was supporting. Jones wanted to speak to the crowd that had gathered outside the Capitol. While in the governor's office, Wilkinson told Jones that if he spoke to the crowd, he should never \\" in this office again.\\" Jones defied Wilkinson by speaking to the teachers and, according to Penny Miller, editor of Jones' public papers, never again entered Wilkinson's office. =Other matters of Wilkinson's term= Wilkinson also advanced economic development in the state. During his tenure, Delta Air Lines nearly doubled the number of people it employed at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport; Wilkinson secured Delta's expansion by agreeing to limit the company's sales tax liability on jet fuel to $4 million annually.\\"Plus Business\\". Chicago Sun- Times Additionally, Scott Paper Company opened a plant near Owensboro and North American Stainless, a Spanish-owned steel company, located a plant near Carrollton. During his term in office, Wilkinson served on the Education Commission of the States, the Southern Growth Policies Board, and the Council of the State Governments and the Southern States Energy Board. He was elected chair of the Southern Governors Association in 1990 and served on the Education Commission of the States' Policy and Priorities Committee.\\"Wilkinson to Lead Governors Group\\". The Kentucky Post The Wilkinson administration was dogged by ethical questions that eventually resulted in prosecution of some members. Before being elected governor, Wilkinson asked the Kentucky attorney general to rule on his ownership of the Holiday Inn Capital Plaza Hotel in Frankfort. The ruling stated that he should sell the hotel, and in November 1987, Kentucky Central Life Insurance, a state-regulated company, purchased the property for $12 million, which included $8.2 million of debt.Adams, pp. 242‚Äì243 Kentucky Central became insolvent in 1994 and was ordered into liquidation. The following year, Kentucky Insurance Commissioner George Nichols III assumed the liquidation and brought suit against Wilkinson stating that the property was only worth $6 million.Adams, p. 243 Franklin County Circuit Judge Earl O'Bannon dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that Wilkinson had not knowingly participated in Kentucky Central's breach of financial responsibility, even though it had, in his words, an \\"odor of politics.\\" Further, an FBI (Operation Boptrot) investigation of the Kentucky General Assembly led to Wilkinson's nephew, Bruce N. Wilkinson, who served as his appointment secretary. Bruce Wilkinson was convicted of extortion, fined $20,000, and sentenced to three years in prison. Wallace Wilkinson was investigated by a grand jury but never indicted. He vehemently denied any wrongdoing. In 1990, Wilkinson's wife, Martha, announced that she would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1991.Adams, p. 242 The move was widely seen as a surrogate candidacy so that her husband could continue his administration for a second consecutive term. Her challengers included Lieutenant Governor Jones, Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler, and Dr. Floyd G. Poore, the former Kentucky highway director. With polls consistently showing little support for her candidacy, Mrs. Wilkinson dropped out of the race in May 1991. Earlier in the year, Wallace Wilkinson was diagnosed with limited- stage Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis was also a factor in Ms. Wilkinson's withdrawal from the race. Wallace underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, then received radiation therapy at the University of Kentucky. These treatments eliminated all signs of the disease by 1993, and doctors gave Wilkinson an excellent chance of recovery. As Wilkinson's term ended, he appointed himself to a six-year term on the University of Kentucky's board of regents. The move was unprecedented, and was particularly controversial because of Wilkinson's open feuds with Charles T. Wethington, Jr., the university president. An incensed legislature passed a law shortly thereafter that dissolved the existing boards of trustees at all Kentucky public colleges and universities and mandated that they be reconstituted by allowing the governor to select each member from a list of three candidates recommended by an independent review board.Miller, p. 17 Jones, who succeeded Wilkinson as governor, used the provisions of the law to remove Wilkinson and several of his appointees from the university boards. Later life and death After his service as governor, Wilkinson returned to his business pursuits. In the early 1990s, he began borrowing money to keep his bookstore business solvent and to support his lavish lifestyle. His interest in running for another non-consecutive term as governor appeared to be dampened by the system of public financing that Kentucky had in place at that time for gubernatorial elections. In 1995, he published his memoir entitled You Can't Do That, Governor!; a major theme of the book was his disdain for conventional wisdom and political norms. In 1999, he launched ECampus.com, an Internet book retailer. Among the investors in the company were Wendy's founder Dave Thomas, Long John Silver's founder James Patterson, and Ohio State University president William English Kirwan.Noland, p. 71 On February 5, 2001, a group of Wilkinson's creditors filed suit to have his companies seized. During the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, Wilkinson admitted that his liabilities exceeded his assets by $300 million. During the proceedings, it was revealed that Wilkinson had been financially insolvent since 1992 and was operating a Ponzi scheme, paying his creditors with money borrowed from others rather than his own profits. He had paid no federal income taxes since 1991. At his deposition in June 2001, Wilkinson invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination over 140 times.Noland, p. 72 Wallace's Bookstore was liquidated for just over $31 million, and ecampus.com was sold for $2.5 million. Wilkinson's wife, Martha, also filed for bankruptcy; his sons were forced to sell their homes to repay loans made to them by their father. During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Wilkinsons moved from Lexington to Naples, Florida. While in Lexington for a deposition on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest pains and was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002.\\"Wallace Wilkinson dead at 60\\". The Enquirer Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002.Jordan, \\"Former Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson dies at 60\\" He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker.

F. Green Airport in Rhode Island and ending at Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, with an intermediate stop at John F. Kennedy International Airport. 37 out of the 88 passengers on board died in the accident. Accident The American Airlines Boeing 727-23, registration overran the departure end of Runway 9 when landing at Harry S. Truman airport. The aircraft struck an Instrument Landing System antenna, crashed through a chain link fence, and traveled another until stopped by a gas station. The aircraft was destroyed. The airport in St. Thomas was notorious among pilots for its short () runway. In fact, the Boeing 727 was the heaviest aircraft type authorized to use it, and even then it was only authorized in one direction. Ultimately, the NTSB attributed the crash to pilot error on the approach. The maximum flap setting of 40 degrees was never applied, which meant that the aircraft's speed was higher than VREF as it crossed the runway threshold. This, combined with the fact that the aircraft 'floated' from turbulent winds in the area, meant that it was already down the runway at the point of touchdown. The pilots did not brake, and proceeded to apply full throttle three seconds after touchdown. However, they were unable to reach takeoff speed because the 727's engines are slow-responding, taking about 6.6 seconds to power up. After five seconds of waiting for power, and with only of runway left, the pilot panicked, according to the report, and applied full brakes. Further, the pilot forgot to apply reverse engine thrust until immediately before impact. Ultimately, the aircraft ran off the end of the runway and into a Shell gas station, killing 37 (35 passengers and 2 flight attendants:Joan Kranik Carrara and Betty Bender) of the 88 on board. Thirty- eight other passengers and crew were injured, and one person on the ground was seriously injured. The probable cause was the captain's actions and his judgment in not being aware that when he touched down down the runway, he did not have enough distance to perform a go-around. As a result of the crash, American Airlines ended all jet flights to St. Thomas, flying instead to St. Croix (which had a 7,600 foot runway at the time). American Airlines passengers were then flown to St. Thomas in Convair 440 propeller-driven aircraft from St. Croix, with these flights being operated by a wholly owned subsidiary, American Inter-Island Airlines.http://www.airliners.net, photos of American Inter-Island Convair 440 aircraft at St. Thomas airport (advanced search) The Convair 440 aircraft were owned by American Airlines and flown and maintained via contract by Antilles Air Boats, a seaplane operator in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Jet flights operated by American resumed when a new runway at St. Thomas was constructed with a length of .  In popular culture  American Airlines Flight 625 was specifically mentioned in the movie Rain Man.

Siegbert Tarrasch (1862‚Äì1934) stated the \\"rule\\" that rooks should be placed behind passed pawns ‚Äì either yours or your opponent's. The idea behind the guideline is that (1) if a player's rook is behind his passed pawn, the rook protects it as it advances, and (2) if it is behind an opponent's passed pawn, the pawn cannot advance unless it is protected along its way. The original quote came from his famous book about the St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament, which was translated into English in 1993: :The rooks belong behind passed pawns, behind their own in order to support their advance, behind the enemy's in order to impede their advance.Tarrasch, St Petersburg 1914: International Chess Tournament, translated by Dr Robert Maxham, Caissa Editions, Yorklyn, DE, 1993, ‚Äîcomment on Frank James Marshall vs Emanuel Lasker, St. Petersburg (1914), rd 3, Apr-24, p. 83, emphasis in original. He referred to his rule 24 years later on page 57 of his book The Game of Chess (1938) as: :In complicated Rook endings the most important rule is one laid down by the author: The Rook's place is behind the passed pawn; behind the enemy pawn in order to hold it up, behind one's own in order to support its advance.Book source This \\"rule\\" is usually true, but not always, as there are many exceptions. Tarrasch has been quoted as saying, \\"Always put the rook behind the pawn.... Except when it is incorrect to do so.\\" . Rationale Consider the cases in the diagram. On the b-file, White's rook is behind the pawn, while Black's is in front of it. Other things being equal, Black cannot do much to stop the pawn's advance. The rook can block it, but as soon as the rook moves elsewhere, the pawn can advance. In addition, as the pawn advances, the space the rook can move to attack it continues to shrink, while the range of the white rook increases. Thus, a rook is better-placed behind one's own pawn. In the case on the g-file, roles are reversed: White's rook is behind Black's pawn while Black's rook is in front. As the pawn advances, White's rook has more freedom of movement, while Black's becomes ever more constrained. White cannot actively block the pawn, but if Black wishes to promote, Black must at some point move the rook off the g-file, leaving the pawn if there is no other support. Thus, a rook is better-placed behind an enemy pawn. Illustrations Here are two positions to illustrate the principle. =Rook behind own passed pawn: win= In the first diagram, White's rook is behind his passed pawn on the a-, and the position is won for White. The winning technique is straightforward: #Move the king towards the passed pawn. The defending king must also move that way, otherwise he will be forced to give up his rook for the pawn. #If the attacking king can penetrate no further because the defending king is in opposition, use tempo moves by the rook up and down the file. Once pawn moves are exhausted, then the defender runs out of options. #If the defending rook retreats, then advance the pawn. The defender cannot keep up this strategy. If the defending king sidesteps away from the pawn, the attacking king moves towards the pawn, and forces its advance. The defender will have to give up his rook. So the only option is for the defending king to move towards the pawn. #The attacking king penetrates the pawn structure as far as possible. If the defender wins the passed pawn, an exchange of rooks ensues and the resulting pawn ending is an easy win for the attacker. #At the right moment, the attacking rook abandons the pawn and joins in the attack on the kingside pawns. The 34th game of the 1927 World Championship match between Alekhine and Capablanca is a classic example of the techniqueAlekhine vs. Capablanca (or see annotated text). The position is after White's 54.Ra4. White won on move 82 . =Rook behind enemy passed pawn: usually a draw= Similar positions with the rook behind the enemy passed pawn are usually a draw, but not always. The next position is after White's 35th move in the eighth game of the Henrique Mecking versus Victor Korchnoi match in 1974.Mecking vs. Korchnoi White will move Ra6 as soon as possible. Black's rook is in front of his passed pawn on the a-file, and the game ended in a draw on move 55 . In this game between Viswanathan Anand and Vladimir Kramnik from the 2007 World Chess Championship,Anand vs. Kramnik Black's rook is in front of his passed pawn; the white rook will get behind the pawn: : 36. Kf2 h5 : 37. g3 a5 : 38. Ra7 Black advanced the pawn to a2, but could do no better than to exchange the passed pawn and rook for the white rook, reaching a king and pawn endgame that ended in a draw (see stalemate) on move 65 . In the position from a game between Wolfgang Unzicker and Erik Lundin,Unzicker vs. Lundin White to move wins, however 48. f3+! is the only winning move. If the black pawn were still on f7, the black king could go back to f6 or g7 and the position would be a draw. (If 48.a7? Ra2+ and 49...Kf3 draws.)The Instructor, Unziker-Lundin New analysis The reason this type of position was long thought to be an easy draw is as follows: #White cannot advance his pawn to the seventh , because that would deprive his king of any shelter. #So White must advance his pawn only up to the sixth, so the king can find shelter on a7. #White's only real winning attempt was to move his king up to a7. Then he can play Rb8‚Äìb6, Kb7, a7 (threatening Ra6), forcing Black to give up his rook for the pawn. #But while White is spending all this time, Black's rook can win White's kingside pawns, then advance the newly made passed pawns. #It has been known for White to even lose this battle of rook versus many passed pawns. #Thus if White tries too hard to win, he may actually lose. Recent theoretical analysis of this position shows that White has a strong maneuver: #Advance the pawn to the sixth . #Move the king towards the . #When the black rook takes a kingside pawn, switch the rook to guarding the pawn from the c-file, i.e. Rc7 then advance the pawn to a7. #Switch the white rook to the a-file with gain of tempo. Thus Black is forced to sacrifice his rook for the pawn without White having to move his king all the way to a7. These many extra tempos make the difference between winning and drawing or even losing. Black must play very carefully to draw, rather than the very easy draw that was long thought to be the case.The Instructor Kantorovich analyzed the position in the diagram on the right and thought that Black draws with two tempos to spare. In 2003 Steckner found an improvement for White that wins. Black's pieces are in their optimum positions: the rook is behind the a-pawn and attacking the f-pawn and the king is in its most active location. If 1.Ra8 Kf5 Black has an easy draw; however, White has a better plan which wins with precise play: :1. Kd4! ::The f-pawn must be sacrificed because the rook is on a7. :1... Rxf2 2. Rc7! Ra2 3. a7 ::3.Rc6+ leads to a draw. :3... Kf5 4. Kc4!! ::The old analysis was 4.Rxf7+, leading to a draw. :4... Kg4 5. Kb3! Ra6 6. Rc4+ Kxg3 7. Ra4 Rxa7 8. Rxa7 Kxh4 9. Kc3 Kg3 10. Kd2 h4 11. Ke2 Kg2 12. Rxf7 h3 13. Rf2+ Kg3 ::and White wins . This 2008 game between Levon Aronian and Vassily Ivanchuk ended in a draw after 62 moves. Aronian vs. Ivanchuk The evaluation of this type of position with an extra b-pawn is still in flux as of 2010, but current theory is that it is drawish . Exceptions There are exceptions to the Tarrasch rule. Here are some. * Yuri Averbakh said that the Tarrasch rule is usually correct when only the rooks are battling over the pawn, but when the pawn is blocked by the opposing king, the rook of the same color as the pawn is normally better protecting the pawn from the side . * In the rook and pawn versus rook endgame, if the pawn is not beyond its fourth rank, the best place for the defending rook is in front of the pawn , . * On a similar note, Cecil Purdy said that a rook is best behind its passed pawn if it is on the fifth rank or higher, or can reach those ranks. If the pawn is held up before the fifth rank, the rook is better in front of the pawn. Often the rook is best protecting the pawn from the side if it is on the fifth rank or higher . * In the ending of a rook and pawn versus a rook, if the defending king is cut off from the pawn's file, then the best defence is with the rook on its first rank . See the frontal defense. * In the ending of a rook and pawn versus a rook, where the pawn is a (b- or g-file), the defending king is in front of the pawn, but the defender cannot get his rook to the third rank for the drawing Philidor position, the defending rook draws on its first rank but loses if it is attacking the pawn from behind , . * In the ending of a rook and two isolated pawns versus a rook, it is generally better for the stronger side to protect the pawns from the side . * If the pawn is a rook pawn it is often better for the rook to attack it from the side, especially in a rook and pawn versus rook position . (See the Vanƒçura position.) * If a rook is in front of its passed pawn, it is often best for the defending rook to attack from the side. In fact, it is sometimes best to switch the defending rook from behind the pawn to the side . * In the ending of a rook versus a pawn or pawns, the rook is best placed on its first rank , . * When a rook is battling against pawns, if the pawns are not connected, it is often best for the rook to hold the pawns up along a rank . =Short vs. Yusupov= This position from Nigel Short and Artur Yusupov in 1984Short vs. Yusupov is an exception to the rule, since white's king is stuck in front of the pawn . White played 1. Rh3 (rook behind passed pawn), Black replied 1... Kf5 and a draw resulted a few moves later. The move 1. Rf7 by White leads to a win. =Kharlov vs. Morozevich= The position from a 1995 game between Andrei Kharlov and Alexander MorozevichKharlov vs. Morozevich is one in which the Tarrasch rule does not apply (for Black) . The move 1...Rb7 would be in accordance with the Tarrasch rule, but 1... Re5 is the correct method because White's king is cut off from the pawn, White will have to spend a lot of time activating his rook, and by that time the black king will be able to get over to the queenside. The rule still applies for White, however, and the game continued: :2. Rd4 Kf6 3. Rd8 Ke7 4. Rb8 Kd7 5. Rb7+ Kc6 6. Rxf7 b4 7. Rf6+ Kb5 8. Rxg6 b3 9. Rg8 Re6 10. Rb8+ Rb6 11. Rd8 b2 12. Rd1 Rc6 0‚Äì1 After 13.Kg2 Rc1 14.Rd8 b1=Q 15.Rb8+ Kc6 16.Rxb1 Rxb1 Black's king is close enough to the kingside pawns to stop them. =Kramnik vs. Beliavsky= The 1993 game between Vladimir Kramnik and Alexander Beliavsky has an unusual position in which following the Tarrasch Rule is incorrect.Kramnik vs. Beliavsky White played 1. Ra1 and lost. 1.Rb8, abandoning the pawn so the rook can attack from behind, draws. The endgame with rooks and f- and h-pawns was analyzed to be a draw by Mikhail Botvinnik in the 1940s (with correct defense) . =Yusupov vs. Timman= In this 1992 gameYusupov vs. Timman, 1992 between Artur Yusupov and Jan Timman, 35.Re4! wins but 35. Ra1? in the actual game only draws. The game was drawn twenty moves later .

Captain Greenlee asked the tower controller for a weather report from the plane ahead of Flight 1016, a Fokker 100 that had just landed on runway 18R. The tower told Flight 1016 that the Fokker pilot reported \\"smooth sailing.\\" In post-crash interviews, multiple passengers and flight attendants told the NTSB that the flight seemed normal until the plane entered a storm with heavy rain while on final approach. At 18:40, a tower controller issued a windshear warning to all aircraft, but on a different radio frequency than that used by Flight 1016. About a minute later, as Flight 1016 was on final approach, the captain, realizing that his aircraft was in a serious predicament, attempted to abort the landing by instructing the first officer to \\"take it around, go to the right\\". The captain then radioed the control tower and stated \\"USAir ten sixteen's on the go\\"; the tower acknowledged the missed approach and cleared Flight 1016 to climb to . The plane struggled to climb due to the severe weather conditions, veered to the right and rapidly descended. The flight crew desperately tried to control the airplane as it plummeted toward the ground. It was later determined that the wind shear alert system did not alert them with a red indicator and aural warning because of a software discrepancy that lowered the sensitivity while the flaps were in transit from 40 degrees to 15 degrees during the go around procedure. A Honeywell engineer stated that the pilots should have received a warning 8‚Äì9 seconds before impact.

It then crashed through the airport fence and impacted several trees, breaking apart while skidding down a residential street that was on the airport boundary. The plane broke into four major sections; the front of the airplane, including the cockpit and the unoccupied first class passenger cabin, came to rest in the middle of Wallace Neel Road. The rear section of the fuselage, including the tail and the rear-mounted engines, came to rest in the carport of a house. N954VJ's nose section separated by the impact of multiple tree strikes Of the 52 passengers on board, 37 died due to blunt force trauma, burns from the fire, or carbon monoxide inhalation. An additional 14 passengers suffered serious injuries, and one had minor injuries. Of the five crew members, both pilots suffered minor injuries, two flight attendants were seriously injured and the remaining flight attendant sustained minor injuries. No one on the ground was injured. The airport's previous major incident was twenty years earlier, Eastern Air Lines Flight 212, also a DC-9, in September 1974. Investigation and response The NTSB immediately dispatched an investigation team, which recovered the CVR and FDR from the plane's wreckage. After a lengthy investigation by the NTSB, it was concluded that a microburst had been generated by the thunderstorm that was over the airport at the time of the crash. The NTSB listed these contributing factors: #The flight crew's decision to continue an approach to an area where a microburst was likely. #The failure of the flight crew to recognize wind shear quickly (exacerbated by an error in the wind shear alert software; the wind shear alert system should have warned them about 8‚Äì9 seconds prior to impact) #The failure of the flight crew to establish proper pitch and engine power that would have brought them out of the wind shear #The lack of timely weather information by air traffic control to the crew of Flight 1016 In the media The Flight 1016 crash is discussed in a Mayday (Air Disasters in the U.S.) television series episode, \\"Racing the Storm\\" (S1E2), about American Airlines Flight 1420, which also crashed while landing in inclement weather. The accident was later featured in Mayday episode \\"Storming Out\\" (S17E6). Flight 1016 was also the subject of an episode of The Unexplained, a Biography Channel series.

Life and career The Hunters at Rest Vasily Perov was born on 2 January 1834 (21 December 1833 Old Style) in Tobolsk, Tobolsk Governorate, Russian Empire, as Vasily Grigorevich Vasiliev (–í–∞—Å–∏ÃÅ–ª–∏–π –ì—Ä–∏–≥–æÃÅ—Ä—å–µ–≤–∏—á –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤). Perov was an illegitimate son of the local procurator baron, Baron Gregor Gustav Friedrich von Kr√ºdener, who belonged to a German and Baltic German noble family, which belonged to the Uradel, and Akulina Ivanova, a native citizen of Tobolsk. Although Perov's parents married soon after his birth, there was no legal way to inherit his father's name and baron title, so he was registered under his godfather's surname ‚Äî Vasiliev. He later changed his surname to Perov ‚Äî a nickname given to him by his teacher who taught him calligraphy as a child (the word pero means feather in Russian).Perov, Vasily Grigorievich in the Russian Biographical Dictionary in 25 Volumes. Saint Petersburg, 1896‚Äî1918. After completing a course at Arzamas uyezd school, Perov was transferred to the Alexander Stupin art school also located in Arzamas. In 1853, Perov was admitted to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in Moscow, where he learned from several renowned artists. In 1856, Perov was awarded with a minor silver medal for his sketch of a boy's head, presented to the Imperial Academy of Arts. Later the Academy gave him many other awards: in 1857 a major silver medal for Commissary of Rural Police Investigating, a minor golden medal for the Scene on a Grave and the Son of a Dyak Promoted to First Rank, and in 1861 a major golden medal for Sermon in a Village. thumb In 1862, after receiving the right to a state-paid trip abroad together with a golden medal, Perov travelled to Western Europe, visiting several German cities, and then Paris. During this time he created paintings depicting scenes from European streetlife, such as the Vendor of statuettes, the Savoyard, the Organ-Grinder in Paris, the Musicians and the Bystanders, and the Paris Ragpickers. Returning to Moscow early, from 1865 to 1871 Perov created his best known pieces, The Queue at The Fountain, A Meal in the Monastery, Last Journey, Troika, the Lent Monday, Arrival of a New Governess in a Merchant House, the Drawing Teacher, A Scene at the Railroad, the Last Tavern at Town Gate, the Birdcatcher, the Fisherman, and the Hunters at Rest. In 1866, Perov received the title of an academician, and in 1871 the position of a Professor at Moscow School of Arts, Sculpture and Architecture. It was around this period that Perov joined the Peredvizhniki, a collective of Russian realist painters formed as an artists cooperative in protest of academic restrictions. (1865 - 1876) Perov died on 10 June (29 May O.S.), 1882 in the village Kuzminki, now Kuzminki District of Moscow) from tuberculosis, and his body was interred at the Donskoy Cemetery.

She was arrested with Bu≈°iƒá in 1976 after hijacking TWA Flight 355 and sentenced to life in prison, with early parole. Life According to her memoir, she was born in Eugene, Oregon, USA and was raised in Portland, Oregon. She graduated from the University of Oregon, attended Vienna University (Austria), and obtained a master's degree in German language, literature, and linguistics at Portland State University. In Oregon, she worked as a nurse's aid, teacher, and mental health therapist for abused teenagers. She married Zvonko Bu≈°iƒá in 1972 and they lived together in Austria, Germany, Oregon, and Ohio before moving to New York City. They were active in publicizing human rights abuses in the former Yugoslavia, especially the murder of Croatian dissidents by the Yugoslav secret police organization UDBA in the so-called \\"black program,\\" and in promoting the cause of Croatian independence. Julienne Bu≈°iƒá and a friend were imprisoned briefly in Zagreb in the early 1970s for disseminating literature critical of the Yugoslavian government. On September 10, 1976, she, her husband, and three others hijacked domestic Trans World Airlines flight 355 departing from New York for Chicago, using the threat of a bomb. While refueling the hijacked plane at Montreal's Mirabel International Airport, they told officials that they had planted a bomb in a locker at Grand Central Terminal and gave them instructions on finding it. They demanded that an appeal to the American people concerning Croatia's independence be printed in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, and the International Herald Tribune. The plane was then flown to Gander, Newfoundland, where 35 of its passengers were released. From there the plane was accompanied by a larger TWA plane that guided it to Keflav√≠k, Iceland. The hijackers' initial European destination was London, but the British government refused them permission to land.Bombs for Croatia (Part I), Time Magazine During the hijacking the device at Grand Central Terminal was found and taken to Rodman's Neck Firing Range where police attempted to dismantle it rather than detonate it. This bomb exploded, killing NYPD officer Brian Murray and wounding another, Terrence McTigue. The hijackers had the airliner flying over London, where they dropped pamphlets promoting Croatian independence from Yugoslavia. The group surrendered without bloodshed, with their onboard bomb proving to be a harmless pressure cooker. Zvonko and Julienne Bu≈°iƒá were convicted of air piracy resulting in death, which carried a mandatory life sentence with parole eligibility after 10 years. In 1979, she was attacked in prison by Manson Family member Lynette Fromme. She was released from federal prison in 1989 after serving 13 years in the minimum security Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin in Dublin, California. During and after her stint in prison, Bu≈°iƒá corresponded at length with Kathleen Murray Moran, the wife of the bomb squad member killed during the incident. Murray Moran advocated for Bu≈°iƒá's early release. Murray Moran would later, quite publicly, regret that advocacy. In 1982, Murray filed a lawsuit against the NYPD, charging gross negligence in the handling of the explosives, which \\"caused the death of Officer Murray\\".https://www.npr.org/2015/05/08/405191525/the-hijackers-letter Murray Moran later stated in an interview that Bu≈°iƒá had manipulated her. In their last meeting after Bu≈°iƒá came out of prison, Bu≈°iƒá was asking Murray Moran to write to the parole board for the release of her husband. Bu≈°iƒá subsequently moved to Croatia and has supported Croatian political causes in the United States and Europe. She has been involved in publishing, translation, and literary projects, and written for literary journals both in Croatia and the United States, including Ooligan Press, Verbatim, Gobshite Quarterly, and Vijenac. She is also a weekly columnist for the Croatian news portal Dalje. Her husband was granted parole in 2008, at which time he rejoined his wife in Croatia. Zvonko Bu≈°iƒá committed suicide in 2013. In January 2020 she took part in a controversial Croatian Democratic Union ad to support the re-election of Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá as the President of Croatia.HDZ twitter, 1.1.2020 Books Her first book, Lovers and Madmen (2000), chronicles her relationship with Zvonko and the death threats and attempts on their lives that led up to the hijacking. Her second book, Your Blood and Mine (2008), is an extended commentary on the American federal prison system, as portrayed by her letters to Zvonko throughout his 32-year incarceration. Her third book, Living Cells (2012) is a true story of a Croatian woman held as a sex slave during the siege of Vukovar. In media Bu≈°iƒá is featured prominently in the radio show Unforgiven.

Introduction to John Ruskin  John Ruskin, 1882 Ruskin met La Touche on 3 January 1858, when she was nine years old and he was about to turn 39. He was her private art tutor,Cook and Wedderburn lxvi and the two maintained an educational relationship through correspondence until she was 18. Rose's mother, Maria La Touche, had written to Ruskin for assistance with her children's education after a formal introduction from her friend Louisa, Lady Waterford. Ruskin recalls the correspondence in Praeterita: > Soon after I returned home, in the eventful year 1858, a lady wrote to me > from‚Äîsomewhere near Green Street, W.,‚Äîsaying, as people sometimes did, in > those days, that she saw I was the only sound teacher in Art; but this > farther, very seriously, that she wanted her children‚Äîtwo girls and a > boy‚Äîtaught the beginnings of Art rightly; especially the younger girl, in > whom she thought I might find some power worth developing.Praeterita, 525 Although some debate exists over the nature of Ruskin's first correspondence with Maria La Touche, Tim Hilton notes in John Ruskin: The Early Years that he did not call as immediately as his autobiography suggests. Rather, \\"he sent William Ward to see her, being too busy to call himself\\".Hilton, p. 262 When Ruskin did call on the La Touches for the first time, he was \\"taken with them\\" and \\"felt there was something exceptional about Rose\\".Hilton, p. 264 Upon first meeting Rose, Ruskin wrote in the final pages of Praeterita that > presently the drawing room door opened, and Rosie came in, quietly taking > stock of me with her blue eyes as she walked across the room; gave me her > hand, as a good dog gives its paw, and then stood a little back. Nine years > old, on 3 January 1858, thus now rising towards ten; neither tall nor short > for her age; a little stiff in her way of standing. The eyes rather deep > blue at that time, and fuller and softer than afterwards. Lips perfectly > lovely in profile;--a little too wide, and hard in edge, seen in front; the > rest of the features what a fair, well-bred Irish girl's usually are; the > hair, perhaps, more graceful in short curl around the forehead, and softer > than one sees often, in the close-bound tresses above the neck.  Childhood  She was a high-spirited, precocious, but also very childlike adolescent. Tim Hilton writes that > The Irish girl [Rose] was a puzzle, for she was precocious in some ways and > not in others. Sometimes she had a surprising understanding of adult > attitudes: at the next moment she was once more completely a child. She had > a pretty way of making herself engaging, even coquettish, but could also be > rather solemn. 'I don't know what to make of her', Ruskin confessed. '...She > wears her round hat in the sauciest way possible‚Äîand is a firm‚Äîfiery little > thing.' Ruskin's interest in Rose grew into fascination and adoration for his pupil and their interaction consisted of extraordinary amounts of correspondence. In fact, Ruskin's first letter from Rose impressed him so much that he reprinted it in its entirety in Praeterita. Writing > Some wise, and prettily mannered, people have told me I shouldn't say > anything about Rosie at all. But I am too old now to take advice, and I > won't have this following letter‚Äîthe first she ever wrote me‚Äîmoulder away, > when I can read it no more, lost to all loving hearts.Praeterita, The Works > of John Ruskin, 529 The letter Rose writes is addressed \\"Dearest St. Crumpet\\"‚Äî\\"St. Crumpet\\" being her pet name for him‚Äîand contains sweet, affection, attentive notes about how much she and her family thought about Ruskin during their travels: > I wish so very much that you were happy‚ÄîGod can make you so‚ÄîWe will try not > to forget all you taught us‚ÄîIt was so nice of you.

I am ever your > rose.Praeterita, The Works of John Ruskin 532  \\"Romantic\\" relationship with Ruskin  Although much speculation exists over when Ruskin \\"fell in love\\" with Rose, most critics maintain that she was between the ages of 14‚Äì18. The author George MacDonald was entrusted by her parents to oversee Rose's welfare during their absence, and he served as a go- between for Ruskin and Rose, acting as their closest friend and advisor. Rose's parents refused permission for Ruskin to marry their daughter after being warned about him by Ruskin's first wife, Effie Gray, whose 6-year marriage to Ruskin had ended in annulment due to \\"non-consummation\\". They were primarily motivated by concern that should Rose ultimately become pregnant by Ruskin, their marriage might be invalidated, since the reason for the annulment of Ruskin's first marriage, his \\"incurable impotence\\", would have been disproved. Ruskin repeated his marriage proposal after Rose became legally free to decide for herself, but she still refused. She was willing to marry if the union would remain unconsummated, as was Ruskin's first marriage, because her doctors had told her she was unfit for marriage; but Ruskin declined to enter another such marriage for fear of its effect on his reputation.  Death  Rose La Touche, as sketched by John Ruskin. Rose died in 1875 at the age of 27, in a Dublin nursing home, where she had been placed by her parents. Various authors describe the death as arising from either madness, anorexia, a broken heart, religious mania or hysteria, or a combination of these. Whatever the cause, her death was tragic and it is generally credited with causing the onset of bouts of insanity in Ruskin from around 1877. He convinced himself that the Renaissance painter Vittore Carpaccio had included portraits of Rose in his paintings of the life of Saint Ursula. He also took solace in Spiritualism, trying to contact Rose's spirit. Rose and Ruskin's romance is alluded to in Nabokov's novel Lolita.

It is the only member of its genus, and it is most closely related to honeyeaters of the genus Melithreptus. Three subspecies are recognised. At around in length, the blue-faced species is large for a honeyeater. Its plumage is distinctive, with olive upperparts, white underparts, and a black head and throat with white nape and cheeks. Males and females are similar in external appearance. Adults have a blue area of bare skin on each side of the face readily distinguishing them from juveniles, which have yellow or green patches of bare skin.Blue-faced honeyeater - Canungra - Queensland - Australia Found in open woodland, parks and gardens, the blue-faced honeyeater is common in northern and eastern Australia, and southern New Guinea. It appears to be sedentary in parts of its range, and locally nomadic in other parts; however, the species has been little studied. Its diet is mostly composed of invertebrates, supplemented with nectar and fruit. They often take over and renovate old babbler nests, in which the female lays and incubates two or rarely three eggs. Taxonomy and naming The blue-faced honeyeater was first described by ornithologist John Latham in his 1801 work, Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae. However, he described it as three separate species, seemingly not knowing it was the same bird in each case: the blue-eared grackle (Gracula cyanotis), the blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops cyanops), and the blue-cheeked thrush (Turdus cyanous). It was as the blue-cheeked bee-eater that it was painted between 1788 and 1797 by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter. Blue- faced honeyeater (Intermediate) - Fogg Dam - Middle Point - Northern Territory - AustraliaIt was reclassified in the genus Entomyzon, which was erected by William Swainson in 1825. He observed that the \\"Blue-faced Grakle\\" was the only insectivorous member of the genus, and posited that it was a link between the smaller honeyeaters and the riflebirds of the genus Ptiloris. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek ento-/ŒµŒΩœÑŒø- 'inside' and myzein/ŒºœÖŒ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ 'to drink' or 'suck'. The specific epithet, cyanotis, means 'blue-eared', and combines cyano-/Œ∫œÖŒ±ŒΩŒø 'blue' with otis (a Latinised form of œâœÑŒøœÇ, the Greek genitive of ous/ŒøœÖœÇ) 'ear'. Swainson spelt it Entomiza in an 1837 publication, and George Gray wrote Entomyza in 1840. The blue-faced honeyeater is generally held to be the only member of the genus, although its plumage suggests an affinity with honeyeaters of the genus Melithreptus. It has been classified in that genus by Glen Storr, although others felt it more closely related to wattlebirds (Anthochaera) or miners (Manorina). A 2004 molecular study has resolved that it is closely related to Melithreptus after all. Molecular clock estimates indicate that the blue-faced honeyeater diverged from the Melithreptus honeyeaters somewhere between 12.8 and 6.4 million years ago, in the Miocene epoch. It differs from them in its much larger size, brighter plumage, more gregarious nature, and larger patch of bare facial skin. Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. Early naturalist George Shaw had called it the blue-faced honey-sucker in 1826. Other common names include white-quilled honeyeater, and blue-eye. Its propensity for feeding on the flowers and fruit of bananas in north Queensland has given it the common name of banana-bird. A local name from Mackay in central Queensland is pandanus-bird, as it is always found around Pandanus palms there. It is called morning-bird from its dawn calls before other birds of the bush. Gympie is a Queensland bushman's term. Thomas Watling noted a local indigenous name was der-ro-gang. John Hunter recorded the term gugurruk (pron. \\"co-gurrock\\"), but the term was also applied to the black-shouldered kite (Elanus axillaris). It is called (minha) yeewi in Pakanh, where minha is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', and (inh-)ewelmb in Uw Oykangand and Uw Olkola, where inh- is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', in three aboriginal languages of central Cape York Peninsula Three subspecies are recognised: *E. c. albipennis was described by John Gould in 1841 Issue is inscribed 1840 but published in 1841. and is found in north Queensland, west through the Gulf of Carpentaria, in the Top End of the Northern Territory, and across into the Kimberley region of Western Australia. It has white on the wings and a discontinuous stripe on the nape. The wing-patch is pure white in the western part of its range, and is more cream towards the east.Higgins, p. 608. It has a longer bill and shorter tail than the nominate race. The blue-faced honeyeater also decreases in size with decreasing latitude, consistent with Bergmann's rule.Higgins, p. 607. Molecular work supports the current classification of this subspecies as distinct from the nominate subspecies cyanotis. *E. c. cyanotis, the nominate form, is found from Cape York Peninsula south through Queensland and New South Wales, into the Riverina region, Victoria, and southeastern South Australia. *E. c. griseigularis is found in southwestern New Guinea and Cape York, and was described in 1909 by Dutch naturalist Eduard van Oort. It is much smaller than the other subspecies. The original name for this subspecies was harteri, but the type specimen, collected in Cooktown, was found to be an intergrade form. The new type was collected from Merauke. This subspecies intergrades with cyanotis at the base of the Cape York Peninsula, and the zone of intermediate forms is narrow. The white wing-patch is larger than that of cyanotis and smaller than that of albipennis. Only one bird (from Cape York) of this subspecies was sampled in a molecular study, and it was shown to be genetically close to cyanotis.

In general shape, it has broad wings with rounded tips and a medium squarish tail. The sturdy, slightly downcurved bill is shorter than the skull, and measures in length. It is easily recognised by the bare blue skin around its eyes. The head and throat are otherwise predominantly blackish with a white stripe around the nape and another from the cheek. The upperparts, including mantle, back and wings, are a golden-olive colour, and the margins of the primary and secondary coverts a darker olive-brown, while the underparts are white. Juveniles that have just fledged have grey head, chin, and central parts of their breasts, with brown upperparts, and otherwise white underparts. After their next moult, they more closely resemble adults and have similar plumage, but are distinguished by their facial patches. The bare facial skin of birds just fledged is yellow, sometimes with a small patch of blue in front of the eyes, while the skin of birds six months and older has usually become more greenish, and turns darker blue beneath the eye, before assuming the adult blue facial patch by around 16 months of age. The blue- faced honeyeater begins its moult in October or November, starting with its primary flight feathers, replacing them by February. It replaces its body feathers anywhere from December to June, and tail feathers between December and July.Higgins, p. 606. 422 blue-faced honeyeaters have been banded between 1953 and 1997 to monitor movements and longevity. Of these, 109 were eventually recovered, 107 of which were within of their point of banding. The record for longevity was a bird banded in May 1990 in Kingaroy in central Queensland, which was found dead on a road after 8 years and 3.5 months in September 1998, around away. The blue-faced honeyeater produces a variety of calls, including a piping call around half an hour before dawn, variously described as ki-owt, woik, queet, peet, or weet. Through the day, it makes squeaking noises while flying, and harsh squawks when mobbing. Its calls have been likened to those of the yellow-throated miner (Manorina flavigula), but are deeper. Blue-faced honeyeaters make a soft chirping around nestlings and family members. A distinctive bird, the blue-faced honeyeater differs in coloration from the duller-plumaged friarbirds, miners and wattlebirds, and it is much larger than the similarly coloured Melithreptus honeyeaters. Subspecies albipennis, with its white wing-patch, has been likened to a khaki- backed butcherbird in flight. Distribution and habitat Subspecies albipennis, alt=A medium-sized songbird with a prominent blue eye-patch sits on the ground looking up. The blue-faced honeyeater is found from the Kimberleys in northwestern Australia eastwards across the Top End and into Queensland, where it is found from Cape York south across the eastern and central parts of the state, roughly east of a line connecting Karumba, Blackall, Cunnamulla and Currawinya National Park.Higgins, p. 599. It has a patchy distribution in New South Wales, occurring in the Northern Rivers and Northern Tablelands regions, and along the coast south to Nambucca Heads. To the south, it is generally absent from the Central and South Coast, and is instead found west of the Great Divide across the South West Slopes and Riverina to the Murray River. It is common in northern Victoria and reaches Bordertown in southeastern South Australia, its range continuing along the Murray. It is also found in the Grampians region, particularly in the vicinity of Stawell, Ararat and St Arnaud, with rare reports from southwestern Victoria. The species occasionally reaches Adelaide, and there is a single record from the Eyre Peninsula.Higgins, p. 600. The altitude ranges from sea level to around , or rarely . In New Guinea, it is found from Merauke in the far southeast of Indonesia's Papua province and east across the Trans-Fly region of southwestern Papua New Guinea. It has also been recorded from the Aru Islands. The blue-faced honeyeater appears to be generally sedentary within its range, especially in much of the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of Capricorn), populations may be present or absent at different times of the year, although this appears to result from nomadic, rather than seasonal, migratory movements.Higgins, p. 601. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer. They live throughout rainforest, dry sclerophyll (Eucalyptus) forest, open woodland, Pandanus thickets, paperbarks, mangroves, watercourses, and wetter areas of semi-arid regions, as well as parks, gardens, and golf courses in urban areas. The understory in eucalypt-dominated woodland, where the blue-faced honeyeater is found, is most commonly composed of grasses, such as Triodia, but sometimes it is made up of shrubs or small trees, such as grevilleas, paperbarks, wattles, Cooktown ironwood (Erythrophleum chlorostachys) or billygoat plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana). One study in Kakadu National Park found that blue-faced honeyeaters inhabited mixed stands of eucalypts and Pandanus, but were missing from pure stands of either plant. Behaviour The social organisation of the blue-faced honeyeater has been little studied to date. Encountered in pairs, family groups or small flocks, blue-faced honeyeaters sometimes associate with groups of yellow-throated miners (Manorina flavigula). They mob potential threats, such as goshawks (Accipiter spp.), rufous owls (Ninox rufa), and Pacific koels (Eudynamys orientalis). There is some evidence of cooperative breeding, with some breeding pairs recorded with one or more helper birds. Parents will dive at and harass intruders to drive them away from nest sites, including dogs, owls, goannas,Higgins, p. 604. and even a nankeen night-heron (Nycticorax caledonicus). A study published in 2004 of remnant patches of forest in central Queensland, an area largely cleared for agriculture, showed a reduced avian species diversity in areas frequented by blue-faced honeyeaters or noisy miners. This effect was more marked in smaller patches. The study concluded that conserved patches of woodland containing the two aggressive species should be larger than 20 ha (44 acres) to preserve diversity.Blue-faced honeyeater at Edinburgh Zoo Social birds, blue-faced honeyeaters can be noisy when they congregate. When feeding in groups, birds seem to keep in contact with each other by soft chirping calls. In Mackay, a bird would fly up above the treetops calling excitedly to its flock, which would follow and fly around in what was likened to an aerial corroboree, seemingly at play. A single bird was recorded aping and playing with an immature Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) in Proserpine, Queensland. The blue-faced honeyeater has been reported to be fond of bathing; a flock of 15‚Äì20 birds was observed diving into pools one bird at a time, while others were perched in surrounding treetops preening. The parasite Anoncotaenia globata (a worldwide species not otherwise recorded from Australia) was isolated from a blue-faced honeyeater collected in North Queensland in 1916. The habroneme nematode, Cyrnea (Procyrnea) spirali, has also been isolated from this among other honeyeater species. The nasal mite, Ptilonyssus philemoni, has been isolated from the noisy friarbird (Philemon corniculatus) and blue-faced honeyeater. =Breeding= At Dayboro, Queensland, Australia The blue-faced honeyeater probably breeds throughout its range. The breeding season is from June to January, with one or two broods raised during this time. The nest is an untidy, deep bowl of sticks and bits of bark in the fork of a tree, Staghorn or bird's nest ferns, or grasstree. Pandanus palms are a popular nest site in Mackay. They often renovate and use the old nests of other species, most commonly the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), but also the chestnut-crowned babbler (P. ruficeps), other honeyeaters, including noisy (Philemon corniculatus), little (P. citreogularis) and silver-crowned friarbirds (P. argenticeps), the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), and artamids, such as the Australian magpie and butcherbird species, and even the magpie-lark. In Coen, an old babbler nest in a paperbark (Melaleuca), which had been lined with messmate bark, had been occupied by blue-faced honeyeaters and re-lined with strips of paperbark. Two or, rarely, three eggs are laid, 22 √ó 32 mm (1 √ó 1‚Öì in) and buff-pink splotched with red-brown or purplish colours. The female alone incubates the eggs over a period of 16 or 17 days. Like those of all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown down on their backs, shoulders and parts of the wings. By four days they open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, and the rest of the body on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel (Eudynamys orientalis) and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.Higgins, p. 605. =Feeding= The blue-faced honeyeater generally forages in the branches and foliage of trees, in small groups of up to seven birds. Occasionally, larger flocks of up to 30 individuals have been reported, and the species has been encountered in a mixed-species foraging flock with the little friarbird (Philemon citreogularis). The bulk of their diet consists of insects, including cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, bugs such as lerps, scale (Coccidae) and shield bugs (Pentatomidae), beetles such as bark beetles, chafers (subfamily Melolonthinae), click beetles (genus Demetrida), darkling beetles (genera Chalcopteroides and Homotrysis), leaf beetles (genus Paropsis), ladybirds of the genus Scymnus, weevils such as the pinhole borer (Platypus australis), and members of the genera Mandalotus, Polyphrades and Prypnus, as well as flies, moths, bees, ants, and spiders. Blue-faced honeyeaters have been reported preying on small lizards. Prey are caught mostly by sallying, although birds also probe and glean.Higgins, p. 602. In Kakadu National Park, birds prefer to hunt prey between the leaf bases of the screw palm (Pandanus spiralis). alt=A medium-sized songbird with a prominent blue eye-patch stands on the ground with some sort of grub in its beak. The remainder of their diet is made up of plant material, such as pollen, berries, and nectar, from such species as grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea) and scarlet gum (Eucalyptus phoenicea), and from cultivated crops, such as bananas or particularly grapes. In general, birds prefer feeding at cup-shaped sources, such as flowers of the Darwin woollybutt (Eucalyptus miniata), Darwin stringybark (E. tetrodonta) and long-fruited bloodwood (Corymbia polycarpa), followed by brush-shaped inflorescences, such as banksias or melaleucas, gullet-shaped inflorescences such as grevilleas, with others less often selected. Usually very inquisitive and friendly birds, they will often invade a campsite, searching for edible items, including fruit, insects, and remnants from containers of jam or honey, and milk is particularly favoured. Parent birds feed the young on insects, fruit and nectar, and have been recorded regurgitating milk to them as well. Aviculture Keeping blue-faced honeyeaters in an aviary in New South Wales requires a Class 2 Licence. Applicants must show they have appropriate housing, and at least two years' experience of keeping birds. Blue-faced honeyeaters are exhibited at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Philadelphia Zoo, Birmingham Zoo (Alabama), and Tracy Aviary (Utah) in the United States, Chessington Zoo in England, Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland and Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia.

A member of one of the state's political families, he was the 51st Governor of Kentucky, serving from 1963 to 1967. After serving in World War II and graduating from the University of Kentucky, Breathitt worked on the presidential campaign of Adlai Stevenson, the senatorial campaign of Alben Barkley, and the gubernatorial campaign of Bert T. Combs. When Combs won the governorship in 1959, he appointed Breathitt as personnel commissioner, where he wrote legislation establishing the first merit system for state employees. He continued to hold appointive offices throughout Combs' tenure, and in 1962, Combs endorsed Breathitt to succeed him as governor. Breathitt defeated two-time former governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler in the Democratic primary, ending Chandler's political career. He went on to win the general election over Republican Louie B. Nunn. Breathitt continued Combs' work of improving state highways and parks, improving education funding, and strengthening regulations on strip mining. His major accomplishment as governor was the passage of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, the first desegregation law passed by a southern state. His biggest disappointment was his inability to win approval of a new state constitution. Following his term as governor, Breathitt worked as legal counsel for Southern Railway, and later became vice-president of public affairs for Norfolk Southern Corporation. He engaged in numerous community service activities and served on political commissions aimed at eliminating poverty. Breathitt collapsed while making a speech at Lexington Community College on October 10, 2003. He was admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital, but remained comatose after the collapse and died four days later. Breathitt's oral history project is housed at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History at the University of Kentucky Libraries and is also available Early life Ned Breathitt was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on November 26, 1924.\\"Kentucky Governor Edward Thompson Breathitt\\". National Governors Association He was the only child of Edward Thompson Breathitt and Mary (Wallace) Breathitt.Harrell, p. 200 Breathitt's family had a considerable tradition in politics. A distant relative, John Breathitt had been governor of Kentucky in 1832. James Breathitt, Sr., Ned Breathitt's grandfather, had served as state attorney general from 1907 to 1911, and his uncle, James Breathitt Jr., was lieutenant governor from 1927 to 1932. Breathitt obtained his early education in the public schools of Hopkinsville and graduated from Hopkinsville High School in 1942.Powell, p. 106 Later that year, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force for service during World War II, serving until 1945. After the war, he matriculated to the University of Kentucky. While there, he served as president of the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society and the Lamp and Cross society; he was also a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity. Seeing Breathitt's interest in politics, professors Jack Reeves and Thomas D. Clark asked him to chair the campus campaign supporting a new state constitution. Breathitt accepted, and although the proposed constitution failed, he remained committed to seeing the document updated. In 1948, Breathitt earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration. On December 20, 1948, he married Frances Holleman of Mayfield, Kentucky. The couple had four children: Mary Fran, Linda, Susan, and Edward III. In 1950, Breathitt earned a Bachelor of Laws degree and returned to Hopkinsville where he joined the law firm of Trimble, Soyars, and Breathitt. Political career In 1951, Breathitt was elected to the first of three consecutive terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives, representing the Ninth District. As a legislator, he was the acknowledged leader of a faction that opposed the programs of Governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler. He supported the state's first legislation regulating strip mining, improved registration and election laws, and campaigned for revision of the state constitution.Pearce, p. 157 He also co-sponsored the Minimum Foundation Program for Education. From 1952 to 1954, Breathitt served as president of the Young Democrats Clubs of Kentucky and as a member of the national committee for the Young Democrats of America.Harrell, p. 201 He was chair of the state speaker's bureau for Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign in 1952, and two years later, he worked on the staff of Senator Alben Barkley's re-election campaign. Bert T. Combs put Breathitt in charge of his campaign against Wilson Wyatt in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1958.Pearce, p. 80 When Combs was elected governor in 1959, he appointed Breathitt as State Personnel Commissioner, charging him with writing legislation to create a merit system for state employees. After successfully guiding the legislation through the General Assembly, Breathitt resigned as personnel commissioner to accept an appointment to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. He was also served as chair of a failed state constitutional convention in 1960 and was a member of the Governor's Commission on Mental Health. =1963 gubernatorial campaign= alt=A black-and-white photo of a man in his fifties wearing a suit In 1962, two-time former governor and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler had already begun his campaign for a third term as governor.Pearce, p. 189 The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, if they did not name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience.Pearce, pp. 198‚Äì199 Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.Pearce, p. 199 During the primary campaign, Chandler focused his attacks on the Combs administration rather than the inexperienced Breathitt.Pearce, p. 210 A seasoned campaigner, he bitterly attacked the three percent sales tax enacted during the Combs administration. Breathitt struck back with accusations that, as a senator, Chandler had voted in favor of declaring war on Japan during World War II, but resigned his army commission shortly thereafter.Pearce, p. 213 He further charged that Chandler's son-in-law was collecting campaign donations from individuals who desired favors from state government. The younger Breathitt, thirty-eight years old when the campaign began, adapted well to the relatively new medium of television, while the aging Chandler did not.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 411 Breathitt won the primary by more than 60,000 votes and carried all but one of the state's congressional districts. Chandler's running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, easily won the nomination for lieutenant governor over Breathitt's running mate, John B. Breckinridge, showing that the defeat was not so much a result of factionalism as a personal rebuff of Chandler.Pearce, p. 215 This campaign ended Chandler's political career. In the general election, Breathitt challenged Republican Louie B. Nunn. Still stinging from his primary defeat, Happy Chandler endorsed Nunn, which hurt Breathitt with some members of his own party. During the campaign, Nunn attacked an executive order issued by Governor Combs that desegregated public accommodations in Kentucky as \\"rule by executive decree\\". Appearing on television with a copy of the executive order, Nunn proclaimed that \\"my first act will be to abolish this.\\" Nunn's proclamation won him the support of some conservative Democrats, but cost him Republican votes, especially in Louisville.Pearce, p. 222 The New Republic charged that Nunn ran \\"the first outright segregationist campaign in Kentucky.\\" Breathitt won the election by a margin of just over 13,000 votes. =Governor of Kentucky= The first legislative session of Breathitt's administration was a disappointment to his faction. His youth and narrow margin of victory in the election undermined his authority.Harrell, p. 202 Further, the unexpected death of Richard P. Moloney, a key legislative leader, was a blow to Breathitt's ability to push his agenda through the General Assembly. The major accomplishment of the 1964 session was the approval of a $176 million bond issue to increased funding for roads, public education, the state park system, and social services.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 114 Other minor accomplishments included passing a purchasing law, strengthening strip mining regulations, and improving benefits for teachers. Much of the 1964 session was devoted to a bill to desegregate public accommodations in Kentucky. A rally in favor of the bill was held in March and was attended by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Reverend Ralph Abernathy, and baseball player Jackie Robinson. Despite this, the bill did not make it out of legislative committee. As a member of the Southern Governors' Association (SGA) in October 1964, Breathitt was one of three governors to oppose George Wallace's proposed constitutional amendment to give states and state courts sole jurisdiction over their public schools, preventing a federal law to integrate them.Champion, p. 54 Breathitt's opposition helped prevent the SGA's endorsement of the amendment, since endorsement required a unanimous vote. The 1964 General Assembly also passed legislation to draft a new state constitution. Thirty-eight citizens were chosen to draft the new document, which was based on national models.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 412 County leaders opposed the document because of perceived threats to the independence of local governments and an apparent consolidation of power in Frankfort. Despite Breathitt's strong support, the proposed constitution was defeated by Kentucky voters by an overwhelming margin of 510,099 to 140,210. Breathitt expanded the state park system and led the state to join the Tennessee Valley Authority in developing the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. In 1965, the Midwest Travel Writer's Association presented Breathitt with its top national award for having the best travel promotion. That same year, he was named to the University of Kentucky Alumni Association Hall of Distinguished Alumni. A June 1965 ruling by the Kentucky Court of Appeals that property must be assessed at its full value prompted calls for a special session from Kentucky taxpayers. Breathitt obliged, calling the session in July. He proposed a reduction in property tax rates to offset the increase in the assessed value of property, and also advocated small increased in other tax rates to benefit public schools.Harrell, p. 203 The plan passed despite opposition from Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield. The 1966 legislative session was much more successful for Breathitt. His economic development program, which led to construction or expansion of 749 industries, 57,000 new jobs, and more than $1 billion in new plant investment, was recognized as the nation's best by the Society of Industrial Investors in 1964 and generated an additional $100 million in state revenue. The pro-administration majority in the legislature was expanded in the 1965 elections, and Waterfield, Breathitt's sometimes hostile lieutenant governor, was stripped of much of his authority. Former governor Lawrence Wetherby was selected president pro tempore of the senate, providing effective leadership in that house of the General Assembly. Wetherby introduced a budget which was 27 percent larger than the previous one and contained appropriations for most of the state's political districts. Wetherby's leadership was so effective that the budget passed both houses of the Assembly, virtually unchanged, by votes of 99‚Äì0 and 31‚Äì5 only ten days later. Kentucky Civil Rights Act Passage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964 had paved the way for an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 390 The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the federal statute, and approximately ninety percent of the businesses in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was the first of its kind passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.Hewlett, p. A4 Breathitt was a member of National Governors Conference Executive Committee in 1964 and 1965 and chaired its Natural Resources Committee. In the 1966 legislature, he won approval for several conservation measures, including the creation of an authority to regulate water, soil, and forest resources. The session also tightened strip mining laws to prohibit mining on mountainsides that were too steep to be restored.Saxon, \\"Edward Breathitt Jr., 78, Ex-Governor of Kentucky, Dies\\" In 1967, he was recognized with the U.S. Department of Interior's Distinguished Service Award and Outdoor Life magazine's Conservationist of the Year Award for his contributions to conservation. Other accomplishments of the 1966 legislature included the passage of a compulsory vehicle inspection law, tightening of restrictions on political contributions and expenditures by candidates for political office, and approval of a legislative redistricting law. The governor's road construction projects continued apace, and by the end of his term, Kentucky had more miles of highway under construction than any other state. During his term as governor, Breathitt was chair of the Board of Trustees at the University of Kentucky. Under his leadership, the state's community colleges were placed under the governance of the university. Four state colleges achieved university status during Breathitt's administration. He also established the Kentucky Educational Television network and Kentucky's vocational education system. Later life and death Breathitt was limited to one term by Kentucky's constitution at the time. He returned to his legal practice in Hopkinsville, and in December 1967, became Special Counsel in Kentucky for Southern Railway.Harrell, p. 204 In July 1968, he was named director of the Ford Foundation's Institute for Rural America, suggesting legislative remedies for poverty including the establishment of state area development districts. In 1971, he helped found the Coalition for Rural America and was elected its chair. The Coalition worked to implement the suggestions of the Institute for Rural America. Breathitt also served as president of the American Child Centers to promote private preschool education and was appointed as the federal representative on the Southern Interstate Nuclear Board in September 1968. When Southern Railway became part of Norfolk Southern Corporation in 1972, Breathitt became vice-president for public affairs, a position he held until his retirement in 1992. Breathitt was an important adviser to Governor John Y. Brown, Jr., who appointed him to the University of Kentucky's Board of Trustees in 1981 and 1982. Breathitt's wife Frances died of complications from cancer on July 11, 1985. On April 2, 1988, he married Lucy Alexander Winchester, a former social secretary to First Lady Pat Nixon and cousin to Libby Jones, wife of future Kentucky governor Brereton Jones. Breathitt later served on the boards of regents of Kentucky State University and Morehead State University, in both cases serving with former political rival Louie B. Nunn. From 1992 to 2000, he again served on the University of Kentucky's board, acting as chairman of the board in all but his final year. During his chairmanship, he clashed with Governor Paul E. Patton over a plan to separate all of the state's community colleges (except Lexington Community College) from the university's governance and place them under a newly created body called the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Patton's plan prevailed, and he and Breathitt later mended political fences. In 1992, Breathitt joined the law firm of Wyatt, Tarrant, and Combs. He undertook several volunteer community service activities, including serving as director of Home Loan Bank in Cincinnati and chairman of the Kentucky Heart Fund.Harrell, pp. 204‚Äì205 He was appointed to the Southern Region Education Board and the Kentucky Council on Higher Education.Harrell, p. 205 In 1994, he was named to the Gatton College of Business Alumni Hall of Fame at the University of Kentucky; in 1997, he received a similar honor from the College of Law at the university. He also received an honorary doctorate from Murray State University in 1994. In 1999, he received the Henry Clay Medallion for Distinguished Service and in 2000, Eastern Kentucky University's Center for Kentucky History and Politics presented him with the John Sherman Cooper Award for Outstanding Public Service to Kentucky. He retired from the practice of law in 2002. While giving a speech at Lexington Community College on October 10, 2003, Breathitt collapsed due to ventricular fibrillation.\\"Former Board Chair Edward Breathitt Dies\\". University of Kentucky He was resuscitated and admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital but remained comatose and died on October 14. He was buried at the Riverside Cemetery in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. In 2000, the Pennyrile Parkway in western Kentucky was renamed the Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway in his honor.

Other species formerly referred to this genus include: * \\"Titanosaurus\\" rahioliensis - Described based on teeth, this species is now considered an indeterminate neosauropod. * \\"Titanosaurus\\" colberti - This species was the most well-known species of Titanosaurus, but has been moved into its own genus, Isisaurus. * \\"Titanosaurus\\" australis - Known from relatively complete remains, but has been renamed Neuquensaurus. * \\"Titanosaurus\\" nanus - A small species found to be non diagnostic, and hence a nomen dubium. * \\"Titanosaurus\\" robustus - Now referred to Neuquensaurus. * \\"Titanosaurus\\" madagascariensis - nomen dubium; UCB 92305 apparently related to Vahiny, while UCM 92829 has been reassigned to Rapetosaurus. * \\"Titanosaurus\\" falloti - This large species, native to Laos, has disputed affinities. It has been considered synonymous with Tangvayosaurus and Huabeisaurus, but the remains are too fragmentary to be sure. * \\"Titanosaurus\\" valdensis - Referred to a new genus, Iuticosaurus, but still considered a nomen dubium. * \\"Titanosaurus\\" lydekkeri - Also referred to Iuticosaurus, but its relation to I. valdensis is uncertain. * \\"Titanosaurus\\" dacus - A dwarf titanosaur; now moved to the genus Magyarosaurus.

He was editorial chairman of the Outlook Group. Mehta was forced to resign from the editorship of The Independent newspaper in 1989, 29 days after launching it, because of a story based on a dubious RAW report, calling the Maharashtrian politician Y.

He batted left and threw right. In his nine-season career, he played with the Oakland Athletics (‚Äì), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (‚Äì), Milwaukee Brewers (), and Chicago Cubs (2004‚Äì). Grieve was a prospect who won the American League Rookie of the Year award while playing for the Oakland Athletics. His father, Tom, was also a Major League Baseball player. High school Grieve attended Martin High School in Arlington, Texas, where he was teammates with Matt Blank and won a Texas baseball championship in 1993. As a senior in 1994, he hit .486. He benefited from receiving hitting instruction from Tom's former teammate and then-Texas Rangers hitting coach, Tom Robson. He also played basketball at Martin. He initially committed to play college baseball at TCU. Professional career =Oakland Athletics= Grieve was selected by the Oakland Athletics with the second pick of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft, behind Paul Wilson. Before the 1998 season, Baseball America ranked him the best prospect in baseball. In 1998, he hit .288, with 18 home runs and 89 RBIs posting a .840 OPS. His campaign earned him the American League Rookie of the Year Award. In 1999, he followed up with a solid season, hitting .265 with 28 home runs and 86 RBIs. In the 2000 season, he hit 27 home runs, drove in 104 RBIs, and hit .279. The Athletics won 91 games and the American League West division title. Following the 2000 season, he was involved in a three-team trade that sent him to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. That trade sent Johnny Damon and Mark Ellis to the Athletics. =Career after trade to Tampa Bay= With the Devil Rays in 2001, he hit 11 HR with 72 RBI, Grieve's slugging percentage dropping a full 100 points from the prior year. The following season () he battled injuries, but did manage to hit 19 home runs and drive in 64 RBI in 136 games. In 2003, in 55 games, he hit .230, with 4 home runs and 17 RBI in 165 at-bats.

He served primarily as a back-up outfielder for both the Cubs and the Brewers that year. In all, he appeared in 123 games between the two teams, hitting just 8 home runs and driving in 35 runs. Grieve departed the Cubs in the 2004‚Äì2005 offseason as a free agent; he eventually signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a non-roster invitee to 2005 spring training. He was cut by the Pirates prior to the regular season, which made him again a free agent. At the beginning of the 2005 season, he was signed by the Cubs to a minor-league contract, which assigned him to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. During the season, he was up and down, having two short call-ups followed by activation midway through September (following roster expansion). He ended the 2005 season having played in just 23 games at the majors, during which he hit 1 home run and had 5 RBIs. Grieve spent the entire season in the White Sox minor-league organization.

This was a different storm from the historic event that struck the Midwest and southern Canada around December 23 from another cyclone which preceded this storm. The event involved a thin band of snowfall with unusually cold temperatures for the middle Texas coast, and caused dozens of varied weather records to be shattered. It was the most significant snow for the Texas Gulf Coast, and deep South Texas, since February 1895. Anticipation of the event There had been indications for up to a week before the event that a frontal wave in the Gulf of Mexico was expected to track far enough to the south (along roughly the 26th parallel) to lead to snow along the Gulf of Mexico coastline of the United States. Synoptic history A surface cyclone formed in the western Gulf of Mexico on December 24 and December 28 due to a shortwave aloft, and moved eastward through the western Gulf of Mexico, bringing banded snowfall to the middle Texas coast. The extratropical cyclone moved east, then northeast, tracking across the northern peninsula of Florida early on December 26 before moving about 100 miles (200 km) offshore the Southeast, paralleling the coast. Continuing to deepen, the developing storm moved about 200 miles (300 km) offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, and Atlantic Canada on December 27 before moving out to sea. Effects Christmas Day in Deep South Texas =Texas and Louisiana= The most noticeable, and unusual, event associated with the storm was the snowfall it produced. Much of the snow fell in southern Texas, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, but some snow, albeit less deep, fell across southwestern and southeastern Louisiana. Any snowfall in these areas is extremely unusual, perhaps occurring once every twenty years, and these events are usually airborne flurries which melt on contact with the ground. In many places the snow stuck to the ground and accumulated to an appreciable depth. In Brownsville, Texas, snow fell to a depth of , the first measurable snowfall at the city in years, since the Great Blizzard of 1899. Trinity Church in Houston Christmas Eve 2004 The fact that the snow accumulated overnight on Christmas Eve led to a White Christmas the next morning, something completely foreign to the region. Across all of southern Texas and in southwestern Louisiana, snow fell in places where it had not for anywhere from 15 to 120 years. Near the coast, in Corpus Christi, Texas, of snow fell, more snow than in all previous recorded years combined. This was also the case in Victoria, Texas, where a significant fell. New Orleans, Louisiana had its first white Christmas in 50 years. In addition to the unusual occurrence of snow inland, moderate to heavy snow was also reported over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. This is the first significant snow fall in Houston since February 12, 1960, when a snowstorm hit central and south Texas with eight to 10 inches of snow.

She led the National Committee on Religious Schools for the National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods. Early life Born as Paula Herskovitz in Pensacola, Florida, she married Rabbi William Ackerman in 1919. She led the congregation at the Temple Beth Israel in Meridian, Mississippi. She had led services before, when her husband was absent or ill. She continued to lead the congregation until a replacement was found in September 1953, although she was never formally ordained. Regarding her chances of being selected for the job, Ackerman wrote to a friend, \\"I also know how revolutionary the idea is-- therefore it seems to be a challenge that I pray I can meet. If I can just plant a seed for the Jewish woman's larger participation--if perhaps it will open a way for women students to train for congregational leadership--then my life would have some meaning.\\" A woman would not be ordained in Reform Judaism until 1972, when Sally Priesand was formally made a rabbi.

He was the state's first popularly-elected senator after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment. Descended from a prominent political family, Beckham was chosen as Democrat William Goebel's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 despite the fact that he had turned 30, the minimum age for governor, during the campaign. Goebel lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor, but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results. During the political wrangling that followed, an unknown assassin shot Goebel. A day later the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give the election to Goebel, who was sworn into office on his deathbed. Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly, and a legal fight occurred between him and Beckham over the governorship. Beckham ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state. Beckham later won a special election to fill the remainder of Goebel's term, since less than half the term had expired, and an election in his own right in 1903. During his second term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a US senator. His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party, and in 1908 the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor from 1895 to 1899. Six years later, Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920, largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing both in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 (with suspected electoral fraud) and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940. Beckham County, Oklahoma, is named for him. Early life He was born at Wickland, near Bardstown in Nelson County, Kentucky, son of William Netherton and Julia Tevis (Wickliffe) Beckham.\\"Beckham, John Crepps Wickliffe\\"Harrison, p. 65 His maternal grandfather, Charles A. Wickliffe, was governor of Kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and served as postmaster general in the administration of John Tyler.Burckel in Kentucky's Governors, p. 137 His uncle, Robert C. Wickliffe, served as governor of Louisiana. Beckham obtained his early education at Roseland Academy in Bardstown. In 1881, he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at 12.Burckel in Register, p. 288 Later, he enrolled at Central University (now Eastern Kentucky University) in Richmond, Kentucky but was forced to quit school at 17 to support his widowed mother.Finch, p. 38 Two years later, he became principal of Bardstown public schools, from 1888 to 1893. Concurrently, he studied law at the University of Kentucky, where he earned his law degree in 1889.\\"Kentucky Governor John Crepps Wickliffe Beckham\\" He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Bardstown in 1893. He also served as president of the Young Democrats' Club of Nelson County. Political career Beckham's political career began in 1894, when he was elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives.Powell, p. 78 He served four consecutive terms and was its Speaker in 1898, his final year in the House. He also served as a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from 1900 to 1920. =Governor of Kentucky= Democrat William Goebel chose Beckham as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election, and Beckham's native Nelson County was already committed to a rival candidate. However, friends of Goebel assured him that Beckham would be loyal to Goebel's reform agenda, but the two other men Goebel was considering as running mates would \\"stack the Senate committees against him.\\" Beckham was not yet 30, the minimum age to serve as governor, at the time of his selection. Goebel lost a close election to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, the election results were immediately challenged.Klotter in William Goebel, p. 94 With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed.Klotter in William Goebel, p. 95 The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building.Klotter in William Goebel, p. 100 The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election.Klotter in William Goebel, p. 105 Beckham was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later, Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.Klotter in William Goebel, p. 108 Legislative chaos ensued, as Taylor refused to acknowledge the Assembly's decision and vacate the governorship. The Republicans in the legislature obeyed Taylor's orders, but the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February 21, 1900, Taylor and Beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of Beckham. Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the court of last resort in the state. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court. Taylor appealed to the US Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case on May 21, 1900. Taylor's only supporter on the court was John Marshall Harlan, from Kentucky.Klotter in William Goebel, pp. 111‚Äì114 After the Supreme Court ruling, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, fearing he would be implicated in Goebel's assassination.Klotter in William Goebel, p. 114 Beckham became acting governor, but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election, a special election was held on November 6, 1900 to determine who would complete Goebel's unexpired term. Beckham, now of age, won the election over Republican John W. Yerkes by fewer than 4,000 votes. Shortly afterward, Beckham married Jean Raphael Fuqua, of Owensboro. The couple had two sons. As governor, Beckham sought to unite his party and the state by supporting changes to the blatantly-partisan Goebel Election Law, which had been authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the General Assembly.Burckel in Register, p. 289 He stressed non-controversial issues, such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform that both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign.Klotter in William Goebel, p. 45 However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under fourteen to work without their parents' consent.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, p. 205 =Second term= Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms, Beckham announced that he would seek a full term as governor in 1903.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, p. 206 His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and so was eligible to run. His record of reconciliation and of supporting non-controversial reforms prevented significant opposition when he won the party's nomination.Burckel in Register, p. 290 His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates. Funds were allocated for the construction of Kentucky's current capitol during Beckham's second term. In his message to the legislature in 1904, Beckham again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session. Also during the session, funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor Goebel.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, p. 207 In March 1904, Beckham signed the Day Law, mandating racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky. Berea College, a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s, immediately filed suit to challenge the law. Its substance was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Berea appealed to the Supreme Court, which, in 1908, which decided, in Berea College v. Kentucky, against the college. Again, only Harlan dissented.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, pp. 153‚Äì154 Near the close of the 1904 session, legislators approved the creation of Beckham County from parts of Carter, Elliott, and Lewis Counties. Olive Hill was made the county seat. Soon, the county's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties from which it was carved to less than . Carter County joined the lawsuit, claiming the border of Beckham County passed too close to Grayson, the seat of Carter County, and to Vanceburg, the seat of Lewis County. The state constitution forbade county borders from passing within of a county seat. On April 29, 1904, the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the plaintiffs and dissolved Beckham County.Harrison, p. 66 During the 1906 legislative session, Beckham urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies by following the lead of New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated for insurance companies doing business in the state to be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky to bolstering the state's economy and to provide policyholders some protection against fraud.Burckel in Register, p. 291 Beckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, p. 60 He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party. By collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, p. 209 Encouraged by the state's improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state's normal schools: Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green (later Western Kentucky University) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond (later part of Eastern Kentucky University).Burckel in Register, p. 294 With a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor. He could also use his influence as governor to sway the party's choice of his potential successor as governor. State Auditor Samuel Wilbur Hager was Beckham's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger N.B. Hays. Former Governor James B. McCreary challenged Beckham for the senatorial nomination, but Beckham won by more than 11,000 votes.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, pp. 210‚Äì211 =US Senator= Beckham's term as governor ended on December 10, 1907.Finch, p. 39 In January 1908, he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the US Senate by virtue of the primary that had been held two years earlier. The Republicans nominated former Governor William O. Bradley. On the first ballot, Beckham secured 66 of the needed 69 votes; Bradley received 64 votes.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, p. 215 Seven Democrats had not voted for Beckham. Over the next six weeks, 25 more votes were taken, with neither man securing a majority, even though William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee for president, campaigned for Beckham. Some Democrats pressured Beckham to withdraw and to allow a more palatable Democrat to run, but he refused. On the 29th ballot, taken near the end of February 1908, Bradley finally secured a majority, after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him. Beckham's ardent support of Prohibition likely cost him the election. That put him at odds with Henry Watterson, editor of the powerful Louisville Courier-Journal. As governor Beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machine in Louisville. When the Kentucky Court of Appeals invalidated the results of Louisville's municipal elections for interference by the city's \\"whiskey ring\\" in May 1907, Beckham appointed Robert Worth Bingham, a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist, as the interim mayor until elections could be held in November. Bingham eliminated grafting in the police department, closed gambling houses, and enforced blue laws that closed saloons on Sunday. The whiskey ring, therefore, announced that Beckham had forfeited the support of Louisville's legislators. In the senatorial election in 1908, three of the four Democrats who voted against Beckham were from Louisville. Following his defeat, Beckham returned to his law practice. Six years later, Beckham again attempted to win back hia Senate seat. The passage of the Seventeenth Amendment meant that the Senate would no longer be elected by the legislature but instead by popular vote. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a 12-year veteran of the House of Representatives. The Republican nominee was former Governor Augustus E. Willson. Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes.Finch, pp. 39‚Äì40 Beckham served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the US Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs.Finch, p. 40 In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository. After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times.Finch, pp. 40‚Äì41 The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%. During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley. Later life After his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927.Finch, p. 41 This time, he had the support of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks.Finch, p. 42 The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D. Sampson, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election, Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic Governor William J. Fields, who had been elected with the help of the Jockey Club. Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes, with voting fraud suspected but never proved. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him.Finch, pp. 42‚Äì43 Beckham was expected to be the Democrats' nominee for governor in 1935, but the death of his son in late 1934 had left him distraught, and his wife was opposed to another campaign.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, p. 304 The Democrats turned to A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler, of Henderson, who won the election. Beckham supported Chandler's bid, and in return, Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in 1936. Beckham also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government Reorganization Commission. Wickland, Beckham's birthplace, is on the National Register of Historic Places Beckham attempted to return to the Senate in 1936. The head of the Jockey Club, James B. Brown, had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930.Finch, p. 43 In 1933, Beckham's ally, Bingham, had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James's, in London, increasing his prominence and his influence. Beckham also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville Mayor Neville Miller.Finch, pp. 43‚Äì44 The race was complicated, however, by the entry of John Y. Brown, a U.S. Democratic Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives.Finch, p. 44 He had agreed to support Chandler's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler's support in his run for the Senate.Klotter in Portraits in Paradox, p. 310 However, Chandler threw his support to Beckham, and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of Bingham and Chandler, he won 85,000 votes, most of them at Beckham's expense. Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2,385 votes. Beckham died in Louisville on January 9, 1940, and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Beckham County, Oklahoma, was named in his honor at the suggestion of a Kentuckian who was serving as a delegate to Oklahoma's constitutional convention in 1907.\\"Origins of County Names in Oklahoma\\" Wickland, his birthplace, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 16, 1973.Trigg, p. 1 See also *Taylor v.

It was created in 1396 when the Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst was partitioned between Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt-K√∂then. The first creation lasted until 1562, when it fell to Prince Joachim Ernest of Anhalt-Zerbst, who merged it into the reunited Principality of Anhalt. Anhalt-K√∂then was created a second time in 1603, when Anhalt was again divided. In 1806, Anhalt-K√∂then was raised to a duchy. With the death of Duke Henry on 23 November 1847, the Anhalt-K√∂then line became extinct and its territories were united to Anhalt- Dessau by patent of 22 May 1853. Today, Anhalt-K√∂then is mostly remembered as a long-time residence of Johann Sebastian Bach, while he worked for Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then. History Anhalt after being divided among the sons of Henry I, 1259 The Principality of Anhalt arose in 1212 under its first ruler, Henry I, son of the Saxon duke Bernhard III. Named after Anhalt Castle, the ancestral seat of the Ascanian dynasty near Harzgerode, the principality experienced a number of partitions throughout its centuries-long existence. When Henry died in 1252, his sons divided their heritage, with the younger, Prince Siegfried I receiving the Anhalt-Zerbst territory including Dessau and K√∂then. =First creation= The Principality of Anhalt-K√∂then emerged in 1396, when the two surviving sons of late Prince John II of Anhalt-Zerbst divided their heritage and the younger, Prince Albert IV, took his residence at K√∂then. Upon the death of his elder brother Prince Sigismund I of Anhalt- Dessau in 1405, Albert also acted as a regent for Sigismund's minor sons. He himself died in 1423 and was succeeded by his sons Adolph I and Waldemar V. Waldemar died in 1436 and Adolph entered a long-time quarrel with their cousin Prince George I of Anhalt-Dessau, finally in 1471, both concluded a succession contract whereby George took over the government of half the principality and became co-ruler as Lord of K√∂then. When Adolph's younger brother, Prince Albert VI, succeeded in 1473, he had to share the rule over Anhalt-K√∂then with George's sons, Prince Waldemar VI and George II. While George II soon after entered the service of Elector Albrecht Achilles of Brandenburg, Waldemar was able to regain the pawned territory of Hoym and also added Burgscheidungen to his possessions. Albert VI died in 1475 and was succeeded by his only son Philip, with his cousins Magnus and Adolph II, the sons of Adolph I, as co- rulers. Philip died in 1500 and his cousins formally abdicated in 1508 in favour of Waldemar's son and heir Wolfgang, then sole ruler of Anhalt-K√∂then. Prince Wolfgang met with Martin Luther at the 1521 Diet of Augsburg and implemented the Protestant Reformation in his territories; the second Prince of the Holy Roman Empire to do so after the Saxon elector Frederick the Wise. He also became a leading member of the Protestant League of Torgau and the Schmalkaldic League against the policies of the Habsburg emperor Charles V. Temporarily banned, his possessions were restored in the 1552 Peace of Passau. Without heirs, Wolfgang in 1562 ceded Anhalt-K√∂then to his cousins Joachim Ernest and Bernhard VII of Anhalt-Zerbst. Upon Bernhard's death in 1570, all Anhalt territories were formally re-united under Joachim Ernest's rule. =Second creation= Schloss K√∂then Prince Joachim Ernest died in 1586, and his sons first ruled jointly. In 1603, however, the five surviving brothers again divided their heritage, with Anhalt-K√∂then recreated for Prince Louis I. The partition was consummated until 1606, while the Louis' eldest brother Prince John George I of Anhalt-Dessau formally remained the head of all Anhalt principalities. Louis turned out to be a capable ruler; in 1617 he founded the literary Fruitbearing Society and became its first president, he worked with Wolfgang Ratke to implement educational reforms and had Schloss K√∂then rebuilt. When he died in 1650, his son and successor William Louis was still a minor with Prince Augustus of Anhalt-Pl√∂tzkau and, from 1653, his sons Leberecht and Emmanuel acting as regents. As William Louis' marriage with Elizabeth Charlotte had remained childless, he was succeeded by Leberecht and Emmanuel upon his death in 1665. From 1671 Emmanuel's son Emmanuel Lebrecht became sole rule of Anhalt-K√∂then, initially under the guardianship of his mother Princess Anna Eleonore and Prince John George II of Anhalt-Dessau. He took over the government in 1692 and entered into a morganatic marriage with Gisela Agnes of Rath, elevated to a Reichsgr√§fin of Nienburg by Emperor Leopold I in 1694. When Emmanuel Lebrecht died in 1704, he was succeeded by his second-born but eldest surviving son Leopold. Also a minor at his father's death, his mother Gisela Agnes acted as regent, supervised by King Frederick I of Prussia. Leopold came of age in 1715; he was a great patron of the arts, founded the K√∂then court orchestra and, in 1717, employed Johann Sebastian Bach as Kapellmeister. Bach stayed in K√∂then until 1723, where he worked with violinist Christian Ferdinand Abel and met with singer Anna Magdalena Wilcke, who became his second wife in 1721. Prince Leopold died in 1728 at the age of 33; as he left no sons, his principality fell to his brother Augustus Louis. Upon his death in 1755, Prince Augustus Louis was succeeded by his second-born son Karl George Leberecht. During the Seven Years' War, Karl George tried to ease the impact on his principality; in 1751 he joined the Prussian Army and became a general in the Habsburg Imperial Army in 1789; soon after he was killed in the Siege of Belgrade. He was succeeded by his son Augustus Christian, who received parts of the extinct Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst in 1793 and was elevated to a duke (Herzog) by Napoleon in 1806. Anhalt-K√∂then became a member of the German Confederation of the Rhine in 1807. Prince Augustus Christian died in 1812, and the ducal title passed to his minor nephew Louis Augustus Karl Frederick Emil, son of Prince Louis, himself the younger brother of Prince Augustus Louis. Duke Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau acted as regent, however, Louis Augustus died in 1818 at the age of 16, leaving no heirs. =Anhalt-K√∂then-Pless= Coat of arms of Anhalt-K√∂then- Pless In 1765, Frederick Erdmann, the youngest son of Prince Augustus Louis, had received the Silesian state country in the former Duchy of Pless from the hands of his maternal uncle, Count John Erdmann of Promnitz. From that time on, he styled himself as Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then-Pless. His son, Frederick Ferdinand, inherited the princely title in 1797. Upon the early death in 1818 of Louis Augustus, Duke of Anhalt-K√∂then, Frederick Ferdinand inherited the ducal title of Anhalt-K√∂then. He then ceded Pless to his younger brother, Henry. Upon Frederick Ferdinand's death in 1830, Henry succeeded him as Duke of Anhalt-K√∂then. He left Pless to the youngest brother, Louis, who predeceased him in 1841. With Henry's death in 1847, the Anhalt-K√∂then line became extinct, and all territories passed to Duke Leopold IV of Anhalt- Dessau.

Biography  The band began as small jam sessions after At the Drive-In shows. The original band consisted of Omar, Cedric, and Jeremy playing local shows around their home town, El Paso, Texas. Cedric said, \\"Yeah actually we used to be called the Sphinktators, that was early De Facto, just more rock.\\" Omar was actually the singer of the Sphinktators and remembers, \\"We used psychedelic sounds, Cedric played the bass, Jeremy played guitar, and Ralph Jasso played drums.\\" For their first recording they brainstormed the name De Facto Cadre Dub, which was later shortened to De Facto. The lineup of the band was switched around: Cedric played drums like he did before in his earlier bands Foss and Los Dregtones, Omar played bass, and Jeremy ran samples, sang and did the sparse guitar work. Ralph Jasso moved to keyboards but soon quit the band. The self- titled recording was released as a very limited vinyl pressing in 1999; it would be re-released in 2001 as How Do You Dub? You Fight for Dub. You Plug Dub In. through Headquarter Records, now known as Restart Records. Omar met Ikey Owens at a hip hop show. They exchanged numbers and then Ikey met up with them during one of their shows and joined De Facto as their keyboard player midshow. After relocating to the west coast, Ikey joined the band full-time. Following the break-up of At the Drive-in in 2001 Omar and Cedric switched their focus on De Facto. That year eventually saw all the band's releases come out, starting with 456132015 EP produced by Mario Caldato Jr. De Facto's first full-length album, ¬°Megaton Shotblast! was released on the Gold Standard Laboratories label, and received moderate success, probably in part due to the popularity of At the Drive-In. L√©gende du Scorpion √† Quatre Queues, which would be the last De Facto album, followed the same year, released through Modern City Records. Both albums combined band's studio recordings made in 2000 with live recordings from the European tour in 2001.  Break-up and possible rebirth  In 2001, the members of the band teamed up with bassist Eva Gardner and drummer Blake Fleming to form The Mars Volta. Despite this, De Facto continued to play numerous live shows in the following years. During that time, Omar met John Frusciante at one of the shows and the two became friends; Frusciante once joined De Facto on stage as a guest guitarist. The band however did not put out any new material, and following death of Jeremy Ward in May 2003 due to drug overdose, any future re-groupings of De Facto appeared highly unlikely. In a radio interview conducted by Radionica Colombia on 28 October 2008, Cedric Bixler-Zavala revealed that after returning from the South American leg of the current Mars Volta tour, new De Facto material may possibly be recorded. In the same interview, Bixler-Zavala also stated that he will be returning to the drums for the production. To date, it has not been confirmed if the sessions actually happened. Since 2001 the only new De Facto release had been the live footage from the January 3, 2001 show at The Smell, Los Angeles, included on the Gold Standard Laboratories DVD GSL Lab Results Vol. 1 Live in 2007. Omar Rodriguez-Lopez however mentioned the possibility of releasing a documentary from the band's European tours, as well as previously unreleased tracks from Mario Caldato Jr. sessions. Ikey Owens died of a heart attack in 2014, while on tour with Jack White. Influences and genres De Facto's general style was instrumental dub, influenced by the heady sounds of the likes of King Tubby and Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry. However they also dabbled in electronica, Latin and salsa music, and jazz fusion. The band's writing process was largely improvisational, based on an exchange of ideas using drum and bass rhythms as the songs' spines. A lot of those ideas led to what would become the members' next band, The Mars Volta.

Shot in Technicolor, the film is an international co-production of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ireland. The film is about Gorgo, a sea monster captured and taken to London for exploitation, and its even larger mother, which rampages across London in search of it. Plot Captain Joe Ryan is salvaging for treasure off the coast of Ireland, when a volcano erupts, nearly sinking his ship. Ryan and his first officer, Sam Slade, take the ship to Nara Island for repairs. As they enter harbour, they discover the floating carcasses of ancient marine animals, the first hint that something dangerous was awoken by the volcano eruption. Ryan and Slade consult the harbour master, who also has archaeological pretensions: he has been salvaging in the harbour. Some of his men have disappeared mysteriously; it turns out that one has died of fear. After dark, a monstrous creature surfaces, attacks a group of fishermen, then comes ashore to wreak havoc on the island. This dinosaur-like creature is supposedly 65 feet tall. The people of the island finally drive it off. Ryan and his crew manage to capture the monster and haul it aboard their ship, tying it to the deck. Soon, university scientists arrive on Nara, hoping to collect the monster for study, but Ryan has been offered a better deal by the owner of a circus in London. When the ship arrives in London, the circus owner names it \\"Gorgo\\", after the snake-haired woman, the Gorgon Medusa. It is exhibited to the public in Battersea Park. The scientists examine Gorgo and conclude that he is not yet an adult and that his mother must be at least 200 feet tall. Then, an even larger sea monster attacks Nara Island and trashes the buildings, sinks a Royal Navy vessel and is impervious to attacks from other warships. Later, Ogra, now identified as probably Gorgo's mother, comes ashore in London and rampages through the city, destroying buildings including Tower Bridge, despite being bombarded by tanks and infantry and jet fighters, all having no effect. Having demolished a swathe through London, Ogra finds Gorgo and both return to the sea. Cast * Bill Travers as Captain Joe Ryan * William Sylvester as Sam Slade * Vincent Winter as Sean * Christopher Rhodes as McCartin * Joseph O'Conor as Professor Hendricks * Bruce Seton as Professor Flaherty * Martin Benson as Dorkin * Basil Dignam as Admiral Brooks * Barry Keegan as First Mate Harry * Dervis Ward as Bosun Mike * Mick Dillon as Gorgo / Ogra Production The film was originally intended to be set in Japan as an homage to Godzilla; the setting was then changed to France, and then finally changed to the British Isles. According to Bill Warren's film book Keep Watching the Skies, southern Australia was also considered for a locale, but the producers supposedly decided that audiences \\"wouldn't care\\" if a monster attacked Australia; its alleged lack of worldwide recognisable landmarks for Gorgo to destroy was also cited as a consideration. The location where Gorgo first appears, the fictional Nara Island, is probably a tribute to the Godzilla series; Nara being a historical period of Japan: alternatively, it may be an anagram for the Aran Islands, off Ireland's west coast. The exterior scenes set in Ireland were filmed at Bulloch Harbour and Coliemore Harbour, both near the County Dublin town of Dalkey. Other scenes were filmed at the MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Scenes where Gorgo is driven through the streets of London were shot on a Sunday morning, when there was little other traffic. The film studio wanted Gorgo to fight the military, despite director Eug√®ne Louri√©'s objections. Later, Louri√© acquired a print of the film and removed the footage. Gorgo's special effects were achieved by suitmation and miniaturization, a technique pioneered in the Godzilla films. The younger Gorgo was smaller than usual giant monsters so the sets around him were built to a larger scale leading to a greater sense of realism. The creatures were also shot with then-pricey slow-motion cameras to create a sense of scale. The effects were complex and are well respected by special effects artists and fans. The film is also sometimes praised for its innovative ending, in which, unusually for such films, the monsters survive and prevail. The film is one in which every (human) member of the cast is male, with females only visible in the crowd scenes in London. Novel and comic book version A novelization of the film was released in paperback at the time of its original release (Gorgo by Carson Bingham (Monarch Books 1960)). From 1961 to 1965, Charlton Comics published 23 issues of the comic book Gorgo. It included work by Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko. The series was renamed Fantastic Giants with issue #24,which turned out to be the last issue of the series. Gorgo also appeared in a three-issue miniseries that started off as Gorgo's Revenge, before it was renamed The Return of Gorgo with issue #2. The series ran from 1962‚Äì1964. In 1990, Steve Ditko illustrated a back-up story in Web of Spider-Man Annual #6 titled \\"Child Star\\". In this story Captain Universe creates huge versions of toys based on Gorgo and Konga to battle giant monsters that are attacking the neighborhood. For trademark reasons, Gorgo's name was altered to \\"Gorga\\". In 1991, A-Plus Comics reprinted issues #1 and #3 in the one-shot comic Attack of the Mutant Monsters. Due to copyright issues, Gorgo's name was changed to Kegor. Some of these issues were reprinted (in black and white) in a trade paperback in 2011 called Angry Apes n' Leapin Lizards. In March 2013, IDW Publishing reprinted all the issues that artist Steve Ditko worked on (Gorgo #1‚Äì3, #11 and #13‚Äì16 and The Return of Gorgo #2‚Äì3) as a deluxe hardcover collection called Steve Ditko's Monsters: Gorgo. In April of 2019, IDW published a book called Gorgo vs. Konga which collected issues #1 and #13 of the series.\\"B Movie Giants Gorgo & Konga Return in Ditko‚Äôs Monsters.\\" www.outrightgeekery.com, April 17 2019.

He was the founding president of the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs (NASHCO), which includes all Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans authorized and funded under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He is also co-founder and vice-chair of the Montana Health CO-OP, one of the first CO-OPs to be approved for funding by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Morrison is a senior partner at Morrison Sherwood Wilson Deola, a public interest law firm based in Helena, Montana. In 2006, he ran unsuccessfully against Jon Tester in the Montana Democratic primary for the United States Senate nomination. Career In the 1990s, Morrison was lead Montana counsel in the state's Tobacco litigation and represented the New York Times, NBC and other national media in the Unabomber case. Morrison and his wife are co-authors of a Montana political history book: Mavericks: The Lives and Battles of Montana's Political Heroes. Morrison also authored or co- authored other published works on topics ranging from health insurance to climate change. =Montana State Auditor= Morrison served as Montana State Auditor and State Insurance and Securities Commissioner from 2001‚Äì2008. He promoted and implemented Insure Montana, a small business health insurance pool with discounted premiums paid for by an increase in the tobacco tax. Morrison had been advocating the use of increased tobacco tax revenue to reduce health insurance premiums since 2002. Insure Montana won national awards, and became a model for the premium assistance provisions of the Affordable Care Act. John Morrison also drafted Montana's Initiative 155 (I-155) and led the campaign that created Healthy Montana Kids, which instituted a broad reform and massive expansion of children's health coverage. In the first year of operation, it brought over $200 million in new federal matching dollars into Montana and covered 10,000 additional children. Healthy Montana Kids now covers 91,000 Montana Children. As Insurance Commissioner, Morrison banned \\"discretionary clauses\\" in group health and disability insurance plans and successfully defended the ban at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in Standard Ins. Co v. Morrison, 584 F. 3d 837 (2009). Through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), Morrison led passage of a similar model law that has been adopted in more than a dozen states, including New York, California, Michigan, Illinois, and Texas. Morrison also led NAIC opposition to Association Health Plans and fraudulent health insurance. Morrison chaired the Health Insurance and Managed Care Committee and the Market Regulation and Consumer Affairs Committee of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, as well as the NAIC's September 11 emergency task force. As the NAIC's International Vice Chair for Asia, Morrison helped establish the relationship between U.S. and Chinese insurance regulators and, with the US Trade Representative, represented the U.S. in the US-China Insurance Dialogues, WTO Doha Round, in Hangzhou, PRC. After leaving office, Morrison was appointed by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner to replace former Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop on the boards of the Senior Health Care Oversight Trust and the Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania (SHIP) and chaired both boards in 2011. Morrison also serves on the board of the Center for Health Policy Development, parent organization of the National Academy of State Health Policy. =2006 U.S. Senate election= In 2006, Morrison was a candidate for the U.S. Senate in a contested Democratic primary with Jon Tester, the President of the Montana Senate at the time. Morrison initially polled ahead of incumbent Republican Conrad Burns, and was leading in the primary race, but it narrowed to a \\"deadlock\\" a week prior to the election. Morrison was beaten in the Democratic primary by Tester, who then defeated Burns in November. During the Democratic Primary, it was revealed that Morrison had an extramarital affair in 1998. Morrison and his wife remained together despite the affair. According to the Missoula Independent, the woman involved later married the principal of companies investigated by the state auditors office while Morrison was there. Former staffers reported to the Independent that they repeatedly advised Morrison to stay out of the case entirely to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, but they felt that he had not. Morrison's affair reportedly did not affect the outcome of the probe, and the individual investigated was convicted of fraud. The case in question was handled by outside attorney Beth Baker due to Morrison's various involvements. Baker said she was given significant discretion in handling the case. =National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs= In 2012, Morrison, who had become President of the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs, and supported federal low interest loans to CO-OPs argued against Congressional plans to cut the loan funds from the federal budget. Morrison said the 24 existing CO-OPs would increase competition and innovation in the health insurance marketplace. In October 2013, he released a study showing that premiums were 8.4% lower in states that had a CO-OP than in states that did not. In February 2014, Morrison estimated that 300,000 Americans had signed up for CO-OPs to date despite early technical problems. In 2015 he testified before the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations about shutdowns of CO-OPs in various state healthcare exchanges; he said that the situation was the fault of both the Obama administration and Congress. The Obama administration's decision to forbid CO-OPs from limiting the number of policies they sold while at the same time limiting their ability to raise money ruined their finances, and Congress' cutting loans available to them also harmed their financial viability.

The character was created as one of the main protagonists by series creator Agnes Nixon, and first cast to Gillian Spencer on the pilot aired July 15, 1968. Nixon later recast her with Slezak, who became synonymous with the character role following a continual portrayal spanning her debut March 17, 1971 through the ABC Daytime finale January 13, 2012. Slezak reprised the role in The Online Network continuance of One Life to Live aired on Hulu, iTunes, FX Canada, and the Oprah Winfrey Network from April 29, 2013 through the final episode released August 19, 2013. The role of Victoria is the mainstay original lead character of the serial, and her storylines focus on drudgery, love, and family troubles. One of the longest-running characters on American daytime television, Victoria weathers widowhood (three times), divorce (four times), a brain aneurysm, a near-death out-of-body experience (three times), being shot (two times), sent to jail, suffering a stroke, breast cancer, rape, a heart attack, heart disease, a heart transplant, the abduction of three of her five children as infants, the deaths of two siblings, and the death of her daughter from lupus. Most notably, she suffers recurring bouts with dissociative identity disorder throughout the show narrative. Slezak's tenure as Victoria earned the actress a reputation as a leading actor in American serials, with her portrayal becoming one of the most lauded and longest-running in American soap operas. Character background =Conception= One Life to Live series creator Agnes Nixon conceived the central role of Victoria \\"Viki\\" Lord inspired by her relationship with her domineering father, Harry Eckhardt, and her own married family life along the Philadelphia Main Line in Bryn Mawr. Nixon took further inspiration from lead protagonist Tracy Lord of the 1939 play The Philadelphia Story, portrayed on stage and film by actress Katharine Hepburn. =Casting= The role of Victoria was originally cast to Gillian Spencer, who appeared from the July 1968 debut until 1970. Joanne Dorian replaced Spencer from October 1970 until March 16, 1971, when established theater actress Erika Slezak stepped into the role in the following day's episode. Slezak was told she was auditioning for a new character, but when offered the role she learned she was replacing someone else. The producers informed Ernest Graves and Lynn Benesch, who played Viki's father Victor Lord and sister Meredith Lord, of the change in advance, but no one else in the cast or crew knew of the switch when Slezak arrived to work. Slezak became synonymous with the character role since her first appearance in the role March 17, 1971, playing Victoria continually for 41 years until the original One Life television finale in 2012. Slezak reprised the role onscreen upon Prospect Park resumption of the serial from April 29, 2013 through the final episode released August 19, 2013. Two other actresses portrayed Victoria while Slezak was on maternity and personal leave: Christine Jones in 1980 and 1981,Victoria Lord Davidson profile ‚Äì SoapCentral.com and Judith Barcroft in 1987. In the summer of 2003, Slezak's real-life daughter, Amanda Davies, portrayed a teenaged Victoria in flashbacks. Leah Marie Hays played the role of a young Victoria Lord in a series of flashbacks as well. At the death of show and character creator Agnes Nixon in 2016, Slezak eulogized that, \\"When she hired me to play Viki on One Life To Live, she changed my life and my career and I will forever be grateful to her.\\" Slezak expressed interest for reprising portrayal of the character in a short-term guest appearance on ABC's last remaining soap opera, General Hospital, in a March 2018 interview with Soap Opera Digest magazine, ahead of the 50th anniversary of the July 1968 premiere of One Life to Live. =Characterization= At the debut episode of One Life to Live July 15, 1968, twentysomething recent college graduate and heiress Victoria \\"Viki\\" Lord is described by author Martha Nochimson as \\"blonde [and] ivory-complexioned ... the clich√©d American princess,\\" personifying the \\"woman on a pedestal\\" archetype. The show's heroine from the outset, ingenue Victoria initially harbors a strong Electra complex and suffers a bout with multiple personalities prompted by her mother Eugenia's absence from childhood and father Victor's incessant grooming of her to eventually helm the family's communication business, Lord Enterprises. As Erika Slezak stepped into the role in 1971, head writer Nixon matured Victoria to a self-assured working woman managing fictional Llanview's predominant newspaper, The Banner. An increasingly headstrong Victoria, relinquishing her primal desires to pander to Victor, marries working-class Banner editor Joe Riley, much to the patriarch's chagrin. By the mid-1980s, Victoria largely adopts a matronly role along with her capacities as well-connected town businesswoman and socialite, though she is still plagued with intermittent bouts of mental illness. The character comes to mother five of her own children onscreen (three from infancy), while providing surrogate nurture to younger siblings Tina and Todd. Since 2000s, the role has evolved to be regarded as the \\"grande dame of Llanview.\\" In a 2006 Boston magazine article, Slezak remarked of Victoria representing \\"the very classy, very old-world money,\\" with writer Michael Callahan calling the character \\"the stiff-upper-lipped matriarch\\" of the prominent Lord family. American journalist and soap opera critic Connie Passalacqua Hayman (pen name \\"Marlena De Lacroix\\") briefly summed up the character role: > ... Slezak's 'Viki' is the consummate soap opera heroine, because she has so > harrowingly and humanistically triumphed over all her life's tragedies. Storylines =1960s and 1970s= The eldest child of domineering millionaire publisher Victor Lord (Ernest Graves), Victoria Lord, often nicknamed \\"Viki,\\" (originally Spencer) has little time for romance when One Life to Live begins in 1968. She clashes with reporter Joe Riley (Lee Patterson), but they soon fall in love; Victor disapproves and tries to keep them apart. Torn between pleasing her father and following her heart, Viki develops a wild alternate personality named \\"Niki Smith\\", who falls in love with Vinny Wolek (Antony Ponzini). Viki's illness ‚Äî apparently caused by seeing her pregnant mother fall down the stairs as a child ‚Äî is eventually treated, and she and Joe marry December 11, 1969. Joe is presumed dead in a car accident in 1970, and a heartbroken Viki (Slezak onward) finds comfort with fellow reporter Steve Burke (Bernie Grant) in 1971. After Steve is put on trial and exonerated for the murder of Banner secretary Marcy Wade (Francesca James), he and Viki marry in 1972. When a very-much alive Joe returns in-time for the nuptials, having survived his supposedly deadly car accident, Viki is forced to choose between two husbands. Viki initially stays married to Steve out of obligation, but ultimately divorces him in January 1974. That summer, Dr. Dorian Cramer (then Nancy Pinkerton) blames board member Viki for her suspension from Llanview Hospital, and a rivalry is born that will last decades. Viki and Joe remarry in a simple, New York City ceremony in September. In 1975, Dorian becomes the private physician to Viki's father Victor, soon eloping with him. Viki learns she has a half-brother, Tony Lord (George Reinholt), and Dorian plots to keep Victor's fortune for herself. In 1976, Victor suffers a heart attack and dies after wife Dorian denies him medication, and in his wake Dorian wreaks havoc on the Lord family. Viki and Joe have a son, Kevin Lord Riley, who is soon kidnapped by jealous Cathy Craig Lord (then Jennifer Harmon), but is later returned. In 1978, Viki takes in Tina Clayton (Andrea Evans), the sixteen-year-old daughter of college roommate and best friend Irene Manning Clayton (Kate McKeown), who is apparently dying of cancer. Shortly after Irene dies, Viki goes on trial for the murder of her nemesis Marco Dane (Gerald Anthony), but she is later exonerated following confessional testimony by Karen Wolek (Judith Light). Joe dies from a brain tumor in October 1979, and Viki gives birth to their second son, Joe Riley, Jr., in January 1980. =1980s= After a disastrous relationship with con man Ted Clayton, who brainwashes and drugs her in an attempt to get his hands on her fortune, Viki marries newspaper editor Clint Buchanan (Clint Ritchie) in 1982; he adopts both of her sons. Echo DiSavoy (Kim Zimmer), seeking revenge on Clint for her mother's murder, seduces him in 1983 to ruin his marriage, then fakes her own death and frames him for it. Clint is later exonerated after Echo is found alive, and he and Viki reunite. Viki is shocked to discover in 1985 that her former ward Tina Clayton (Evans) is in fact her half-sister, daughter of Viki's father Victor and not Ted. Thanks to the machinations of Tina's boyfriend Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born), Viki succumbs to the pressure and Niki Smith returns. Posing as Viki, Niki divorces Clint; Viki later overcomes her illness with the realization that it had actually been triggered by her witnessing Victor and Irene in bed many years before. Clint and Viki remarry in 1986, and Viki gives birth to their daughter Jessica Buchanan in September 1986. Jessica is kidnapped shortly after birth by Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick), a disciple of Mitch Laurence; Jessica is soon returned unharmed in December, and Allison institutionalized. In 1988, Viki learns that she married and gave birth to a child in high school with high school sweetheart Roger Gordon (Larry Pine), but father Victor had her hypnotized to forget the occurrences. With Viki's memory restored in 1989, she annuls her 1960s off-screen marriage to Roger and initiates a relationship with daughter Megan Gordon (Jessica Tuck), an actress on the soap opera (within a soap opera), Fraternity Row. Megan and Viki initially spar, but ultimately get past their initial conflicts and become close. =1990s= In 1990, Viki is elected mayor of Llanview, but a shooting and subsequent stroke leaves her paralyzed and in a wheelchair; Niki Smith emerges to aid a paralyzed Viki stand up and shoot Johnny Dee Hesser (Anthony Crivello) when he attacks Tina. Viki recovers and later donates a kidney to daughter Megan suffering terminal lupus, but Megan dies, leaving Viki devastated. Growing ever-distant from Clint, Viki engages an extramarital affair with Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes); she and Clint divorce in 1994, and she marries Sloan. Sloan dies soon after from Hodgkin's lymphoma, just as the existence of a second child of Victor and Irene's is revealed. Viki's stress reaches a critical point when Dorian (Robin Strasser onward) tells Viki a secret of which she thought Viki had been aware: the fact that Victor had sexually abused his daughter as a child. With this trauma being what had actually initiated Viki's dissociative identity disorder, she subsequently splinters into several personalities, one of which imprisons Dorian in a secret room below Llanfair. Dorian is eventually freed from her confinement, and Viki recovers after realizing she herself (more specifically, one of her alternate personalities) was the one who had smothered Victor to death in 1976.In recent years, One Life to Live plot twists have strongly suggested that Dorian was Victor's true murderer after all, as was suggested at Victor's initial death in 1976. In August 2007, Dorian makes the startling (and vague) claim to Viki that she had actually killed Victor, and that a man who appeared in 2003 claiming to be Victor was a fraud. Having planted a seed of doubt in Viki's mind, she refused to elaborate. On August 16, 2011, Dorian's husband David Vickers Buchanan (Tuc Watkins) mentions that an (albeit forged) entry from Irene Manning's diary cleared Dorian of Victor's murder. When David states that Dorian is innocent of the crime, she comments to herself, \\"... or so Viki chooses to believe.\\" In 1995, reviled town outcast Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) is proven to be Victor and Irene's illegitimate son; Viki and Todd eventually become close. After a failed reconciliation attempt with Clint, Viki meets and falls in love with Ben Davidson (Mark Derwin), who is eventually revealed to be the long-lost son of Asa Buchanan (Philip Carey) and Ren√©e Divine Buchanan (Patricia Elliott). Ben's first wife, Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), comes to town and tries in vain to keep Ben and Viki apart. =2000s= Viki is diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, but survives after a mastectomy and chemotherapy. She and Ben marry in November. In 2001, a girl named Natalie Balsom (Melissa Archer) makes the startling claim that she is Viki and Clint's biological daughter, which is confirmed by a DNA test. Mitch Laurence returns from the dead, divulging to Viki he drugged and raped her around the same time she and Clint conceived Jessica and had unknowingly become pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint, Natalie, and the other fathered by Mitch, Jessica (Erin Torpey). Unable to reconcile the revelation, Niki Smith emerges during the ordeal and plots to kill Ben in order to have her freedom, but when Ben is accidentally shot by Antonio Vega (Kamar de los Reyes), Viki returns. Ben is left comatose after the shooting. In 2003, Victor (William Stone Mahoney) is ostensibly revealed to be alive, claiming to have faked his death in 1976; however, shortly after he returns, Victor dies ‚Äî but not before Viki and Todd confront him on ills inflicted to them in his wake. In 2004, Viki is diagnosed with heart disease and eventually needs a heart transplant. Coincidentally, a comatose Ben dies just as Viki takes a turn for the worse, and his heart is transplanted into Viki, who recovers but must face widowhood once again. In 2007, Viki and Clint (Jerry verDorn) start dating again, but Dorian decides she wants Clint for herself and plots to break up the couple. Dorian's schemes succeed, and Clint ends things with Viki to start a new relationship with Dorian. Feeling humiliated and defeated, Viki leaves Llanview for a much-needed vacation and finds herself in Paris, Texas, where she tries to reinvent herself by waiting tables at a local diner. It is there that she meets patron Charlie Banks (Brian Kerwin), a recovering alcoholic, and the two begin seeing one another. Viki ultimately returns to Llanview once her family discovers her secret life, and Charlie's search for his estranged son Jared (John Brotherton) leads him there as well. Viki and Charlie resume their relationship, but break up when Viki discovers that Charlie had lied about the identity of his son in extenuating circumstances. In July 2008, Viki is involved in a car accident with Dorian; Viki's heart stops as a result of the crash, but Dorian manages to revive her. Reexamining her life, Viki reunites with Charlie, and they marry on August 4, 2009. Viki runs for mayor against Dorian and wins; she steps down, however, to help her family deal with the unexpected return of Mitch Laurence, who wreaks havoc on her daughters and murders Jared in the process. =2010‚Äì12= Charlie, devastated over his son's death, quits his sobriety and began drinking, distancing himself from Viki, choosing instead to conspire with Dorian to kill Mitch. Though Dorian tries to stop him at the last minute, Charlie ends up accidentally shooting Jessica (Bree Williamson onward), who survives. Devastated by Charlie's actions, Viki asks him for a divorce, but they eventually reconcile. Viki and Charlie's marriage is further complicated by the return of Echo DiSavoy, a woman who almost destroyed her marriage to Clint in 1983. Echo begins insinuating herself into Charlie and Viki's marriage, much to Viki's dismay. When a paternity revealed Charlie not to be the father of Rex Balsom (John-Paul Lavoisier), a devastated Charlie turns to Echo for comfort. Dorian, who had suspicions about Echo and Charlie's dealings, forged a truce with Viki to uncover Charlie's misgivings. A devastated Viki finds out about Charlie's affair and definitively asks him for a divorce. After confronting Charlie and Echo, Viki goes to court to fight for custody of grandson Ryder Ford while his mother Jessica was ill with her multiple personality. A stressed Viki suffers a bout with multiple personalities on the stand, leading the judge against giving the child to Viki but instead to her son and daughter-in-law, Joey (Tom Degnan) and Aubrey Buchanan (Terri Conn). In summer 2011 a man with the \\"original\\" face of her only known living brother, Todd (Howarth), returned to Llanview claiming to be the victim of eight years of imprisonment and torture at the hands of his mother and Viki's childhood friend, a back-from-the-dead Irene Manning (Barbara Rhoades). After medical tests revealed the \\"newer\\" Todd (Trevor St. John) and the \\"old\\" Todd (Howarth) to have identical DNA, Irene appeared to reveal the \\"two Todds\\" to be twins. The man who resembled Walker Laurence (St. John) and who has been living as Todd since 2003 was revealed actually have been born Victor Lord, Jr., brainwashed into believing that he is Todd by Irene. Meanwhile, Viki agrees in court to put up Clint in Llanfair for house arrest after he was convicted of various crimes in Llanview. Dorian and Viki ostensibly put an end to their feud of nearly four decades when Dorian leaves town to become an acting U.S. senator. Viki continues work at The Banner when Tina returns to town for the reading of the will of recently murdered Victor, Jr. After months of rehashing old feelings and living under the same roof, Clint and Viki too admit to their unresolved feelings and agreed to give a romantic relationship one more try. At the original finale, a prison breakout leads Allison Perkins to shoot both Clint and Viki, but only after telling the two that Jessica was in fact Clint's daughter and not the daughter of Mitch Laurence. Clint sanctioned another paternity test and, in the presence of Jessica, Viki, and Natalie, revealed Allison's claim to be true. Following all the emotional revelations and tears, Clint again declares his undying love for Viki and asks her to marry him for a third time. =2013= Upon the series resumption in April 2013, Viki accepts Clint's marriage proposal, and concurrently hires freelance journalist Jeffrey King (Corbin Bleu) to investigate the alleged congressional malfeasance of junior U.S. senator Dorian. Upon visiting niece Danielle Manning (Kelley Missal) in the hospital after overdosing on drugs and alcohol, she uncovers her brother Victor, Jr. to be alive. With her family newspaper in financial straits, The Banner focuses on growing the publication's online presence. =Alternate personalities= 1986 Daytime Emmy Award for Lead Actress in a Drama Series As of the final ABC episode, all of Victoria's six alternate personalities are integrated with her baseline psyche. At times during the series, Viki has been forced to impersonate one of them, particularly Niki and Jean. In order of their first appearance on One Life to Live, they are: * Nicole \\"Niki\\" Smith ‚Äì a devil-may- care, sexually promiscuous party girl, approximately 22 years old. First appearing on the episode first-run November 15, 1968, Niki appears more times than all of the other alters combined, and is very skilled at masquerading as Viki when necessary to hide her re-emergence. Niki has had two serious relationships with Vince Wolek (1968‚Äì69) and Harry O'Neill (1985); neither Vinny or Harry realized at the time that Niki was an alter of Viki. * Tommy ‚Äì a 14-year-old male alter emerged in 1995, who embodied Viki's anger and rage at her abuse. Tommy usually emerged to protect Princess (another alternate personality), and once threw Dorian Lord down the La Boulaie staircase and attempted to beat her to death with a claw hammer in the Llanfair secret room. * Jean Randolph ‚Äì Jean Randolph is the calm, cool, collected and calculating caretaker of all the other alters, who took over when Viki's abusive childhood was revealed. Her name is derived from that of Viki's mother, Eugenia Randolph Lord. Jean blackmailed con man David Vickers into divorcing Viki's sister, Tina, and also freed Viki's son, Joey, from Dorian Lord's clutches by imprisoning Dorian in a secret room in the basement of Llanfair, which led Joey to believe that Dorian left him. Jean then forced Dorian to marry David to keep them both occupied and away from Viki's loved ones. * Princess ‚Äì a manifestation of Viki as a seven-year-old girl. She is a traumatized child who is constantly reliving the molestation by Viki's father. Protected by Tommy, the 14-year-old alternate personality, who is most angry about the abuse. * Tori Lord ‚Äì Tori emerged in 1995, approximately 19 years old, after Dorian revealed the truth of Victor's abuse to Viki. It was established that Tori was the alter who murdered Victor Lord in 1976. (It would later be revealed that Victor survived and did not die until 2003. However Dorian has planted a seed of doubt regarding that notion, suggesting that the man who re-emerged as Victor in 2003 was a fraud.) Although her declared mission was to force Viki to face the truth, she wreaked much destruction before getting around to that. Tori started undermining The Banner by feeding stories and information to rival newspaper editor Todd Manning, and she torched Llanfair, nearly killing Jessica in the blaze. * Victor Lord ‚Äì this personality is the reflective image of Viki's abusive father, Victor. The Victor Lord personality only emerged two or three times, but one of the instances that he took over led Viki to attempt suicide by cutting her own wrists to \\"expel\\" Victor from her body. Reception Series fansite Llanview Labyrinth remarks that although Gillian Spencer's Victoria is featured at the show's outset, \\"the obviousness of Viki being the show[']s unquestioned 'lead' did not smack the viewer quite as hard as it later would [with Erika Slezak's portrayal],\\" with Spencer's Victoria melding into the ensemble cast. Joanne Dorian briefly stepped into the role beginning in October 1970, with a markedly less dynamic presence on the series than her predecessor. In March 1971, One Life to Live executive producer Doris Quinlan remarked to After Noon TV magazine of Erika Slezak and her audition before herself, series creator and head writer Agnes Nixon, and director David Pressman, \\"You've got to meet this girl‚Äîshe's going to be a star.\\" Since the introduction of Slezak as Victoria, her portrayal has become regarded as definitive to the role. Slezak's work has garnered her the acclaim of media critics and viewers alike, earning the actress comparisons between herself and contemporary film star Meryl Streep for perceived similarities in acting range, versatility, and numerous award nominations. Slezak has received nine Daytime Emmy Award nominations in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress for her portrayal of Victoria, winning in 1984, 1986, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 2005. At the finale of the show's last iteration, she held the record for most Emmy wins by an actress. She also garnered the Soap Opera Digest Award for Favorite Couple with co-star Mark Derwin (Ben Davidson) in 2000. In 2002, in recognition for her work on One Life to Live, Slezak was inducted as a member of the Silver Circle of the New York chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for over a quarter-century of \\"significant contributions\\" to television. In July 2020, Soaps.com cited Slezak's casting in the role as the third-best recast of all-time on a soap opera.

Mausoleum of Gazi Evrenos at Giannitsa (after restoration) Imaret of Komotini, Thrace, Greece. Evrenos or Evrenuz (Gazi Hadji Evrenos Bey; died 17 November 1417 in Yenice-i Vardar) was an Ottoman military commander, with an unlikely long- lived career and lifetime. He served as a general under S√ºleyman Pasha, Murad I, Bayezid I, S√ºleyman √áelebi and Mehmed I. Byzantine sources mention him as ŒïŒ≤œÅŒµŒΩœåœÇ, ·ºàŒ≤œÅŒ±ŒΩŒ≠Œ∂Œ∑œÇ, ŒíœÅŒ±ŒΩŒ≠Œ∂Œ∑œÇ, ŒíœÅŒ±ŒΩŒµœçœÇ (?), ŒíœÅŒµŒΩŒ≠Œ∂, ŒíœÅŒµŒΩŒ≠Œ∂Œ∑œÇ, ŒíœÅŒµŒΩŒ≠œÇ. A persistent Greek legend maintains that Evrenos' father was a certain Ornos, renegade Byzantine governor of Bursa who defected to the Ottomans, and then on to Karasi, after the Siege of Bursa, in 1326.P. Voutierides, ‚ÄúNeai Ellenikai Poleis-Yenitsa‚Äù Panathinaia 25 (1912-13), p. 210. He was known as Isa Bey Prangi, buried in the village of Prangi (also known as Sƒ±rcƒ±k or Kƒ±rcƒ±k in Ottoman sources), a busy ferry-place on the Evros river about east from Didymoteicho. Stanford J. Shaw and Joseph von Hammer regard Evrenos as a Byzantine convert to Islam.Stanford J. Shaw: History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey. Volume 1, Empire of the Gazis: The Rise and Decline of the Ottoman Empire 1280‚Äì1808. Cambridge University Press, 1977.Joseph von Hammer: Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches. Zweite verbesserte Ausgabe Bd. I - IV. Hartlebens, Pesth 1836. (Serbo-Croatian edition by Nerkez Smailagiƒá. Zagreb, 1979.) Œüriginally, Gazi Evrenos was a noble dignitary, a bey in the principality of Karasi, joining the Ottomans only after their conquest of the beylik in 1345. He led many crucial Ottoman campaigns and battles in Bulgaria, Thessaly, and Serbia. After having participated in the Ottoman conquest of Adrianopolis in 1362, Evrenos was appointed to uc beƒüi (frontier warlord) of Thessaly. He and his akƒ±ncƒ±s fought in the Battle of Kosovo (1389) and the Battle of Nicopolis (1396). Evrenos conquered Ke≈üan, ƒ∞psala, Komotini, Feres, Xanthi, Maroneia, Serres, Monastir, and, in 1397, Corinth. He founded the town Yenice-i Vardar, modern Giannitsa.Machiel Kiel, \\"Yenice Vardar (Vardar Yenicesi-Giannitsa): A forgotten Turkish cultural centre in Macedonia of the 15th and 16th century,‚Äù Studia Byzantina et Neohellenica Neerlandica 3 (1973): 303. The inhabitants of Gianitsa (Ottoman: Yenice Vardar) down to the early 20th century displayed reverence for \\"Gazi Baba\\", that is \\"papa Gazi\\". Gazi Evrenos Bey was father of seven sons (Khidr-shah, Isa, Suleyman, Ali, Yakub, Barak, Begdje) and several daughters. Among the numerous descendants of lord Gazi Evrenos, apparently the memory of some has dived into oblivion, as their deeds got incorporated into the achievements of their illustrious forefather. This explains the legendary, yet unlikely, 129-year lifespan of lord Gazi. Together with the Mihaloƒüullarƒ± (from the Karasi emirate), Malko√ßoƒüullarƒ± (from Serbia), √ñmerli/√ñmeroƒülu, and the Turahanoƒüullarƒ±, Evrenos' descendants, the Evrenosoƒüullarƒ±, constitute one of the Byzantine families that effectively formed the early Ottoman warrior nobility. Gazi Evrenos died at an advanced age in Yenice-i Vardar. He was buried in a mausoleum there in 1417. The mausoleum survives but was badly mutilated in 19th century and served for a time as an agricultural store. As one of the most successful Ottoman commanders, Evrenos acquired a considerable amount of wealth and founded numerous endowments (awqaf). Several monuments attributed to him survive in southeastern Europe. Of primary importance is his mausoleum, or t√ºrbe, with its accompanying epitaph in Giannitsa. A hammam of Evrenos stands to the south of the mausoleum. Two other monuments stand in Greek Thrace.Machiel Kiel, ‚ÄúThe Oldest Monuments of Ottoman-Turkish Architecture in the Balkans: The Imaret and the Mosque of Ghazi Evrenos Bey in G√ºm√ºlcine (Komotini) and the Evrenos Bey Khan in the Village of Ilƒ±ca/Loutra in Greek Thrace‚Äù Sanat Tarihi Yƒ±llƒ±ƒ°ƒ±, Kunsthhistorische Forschungen 12 (Istanbul, 1983): pp. 117-138.

It also may exhibit small protuberances from the top and may show the cauliflower form characteristic of cumulus clouds. Cumulus mediocris clouds do not generally produce precipitation of more than very light intensity, but can further advance into clouds such as Cumulus congestus or Cumulonimbus, which do produce precipitation. Cumulus mediocris is also classified as a low cloud and is coded CL2 by the World Meteorological Organization. Cumulus mediocris is brilliantly white when sunlit, and is dark underneath. A single pattern-based variety, Cumulus radiatus, is sometime seen when the individual clouds are arranged into parallel rows. The resulting formations are known as \\"cloud streets\\" and are aligned nearly parallel to the wind. Cumulus mediocris may have precipitation-based features like virga, and may form Cumulus praecipitato clouds. The pannus supplementary feature is sometimes seen with precipitating Cumulus mediocris, but in this case the CL7 reporting code normally used with to identify pannus is usually superseded by CL2, since there is significant vertical development. Pileus (cap cloud), velum (apron), arcus (roll or shelf cloud) and tuba (vertical column) features are also occasionally seen with cumulus mediocris. Cumulus mediocris may form as a result of a partial transformation of altocumulus or stratocumulus. This genus and species type may also be the result of a complete transformation of stratocumulus or stratus. Cumulus mediocris clouds. Forecasting These clouds are common in the advance of a cold front or in unstable atmospheric conditions such as an area of low pressure. They can grow into larger Cumulus congestus which could bring rain, winds and in worse cases, thunder and lightning. If these clouds are present in the morning or early afternoon they show a significant instability in the atmosphere likely leading to storms later in the day. Formation These clouds occur when there is more rising air than the Cumulus humilis. Like any cumulus cloud, this cloud requires convection before developing. This occurs when pockets of air around them become warmer and begin to rise. As the air rises, it condenses forming a Cumulus humilis cloud as it continues to rise, a Cumulus mediocris.

Description Myrica rubra is an evergreen tree that grows to a height of up to meters high, with smooth gray bark and a uniform spherical to hemispherical crown. Leaves are leathery, bare, elliptic-obovate to oval lanceolate in shape, wedge-shaped at the base and a rounded to pointed or tapered at the apex, margin is serrated or serrated in the upper half, with a length of and a width of . Leaves are alternately arranged on the branches are divided into petiole and leaf blade. The petiole is long. The leaf underside is pale green and sparsely to moderately golden glandular, the top surface is dark green. Flowers are dioecious. Male inflorescences are simple or unobtrusively branched bracts, which stand individually or occasionally in groups of a few inflorescences in the leaf axils and female. Inflorescence are long, the inflorescence stems are bare, the bracts are almost circular with a diameter of about 1 millimeter and have golden glands on the underside. The male flowers are accompanied by two to four egg-shaped, sparse lanceolate leaves. Each male flower contains four to six stamens with dark red, elliptical anthers. Female inflorescences are single with multi-flowered spikes of in length standing in the leaf axils. The rhachis is hairy and glandular. The cover sheets overlap, are hairless and only unobtrusively glandular. Female flowers are accompanied by four leaves. The upper ovary is velvety hairy, with a stylus with a two-lobed scar. There are two slender scar lobes are colored bright red. The flowering period extends from March to April in China, with fruits developing from May to June. The fruit is spherical, typically in diameter, with diameters up to 3 centimeters, a knobby surface. The surface is a thick-skinned, typically a crimson red, but may vary from white to purple, with similar or somewhat lighter flesh color. At the center is a single seed, with a diameter about half that of the whole fruit.The flesh is sweet and very tart.

Mathematical and natural science class, volume 4, number 3, page 230 published. In studies of germplasm, it was clearly distinguished from wax myrtle, and could be subdivided into two groups unrelated to the sex of the plant, but more so by the geographic region in China where the accession originated. Among regions in China, accessions varied within regions, indicating extensive gene mixing. Nearly 100 cultivars of M. rubra exist in China alone. Zhejiang Province is a possible center of diversity for the plant in China. Chromosome count is 2n = 16  Distribution and habitat  It is native to eastern Asia, mainly in south-central China in province of Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Sichuan , Yunnan, and Zhejiang; Japan, Korea, and the Philippines in forests on mountain slopes and valleys at elevations of . Seeds are dispersed by Japanese macaques. and Yakushima macaque Cultivation M. rubra plate from The American garden 1873 M. rubra grown in Fremont, California Chinese cultivation is concentrated south of the Yangtze River, where it has considerable economic importance and has been grown for at least 2000 years.. It tolerates poor acidic soils. The root system is deep, with no obvious taproot. Myrica rubra was first introduced into the United States by Frank Nicholas Meyer from seed purchased from the Yokohama Nursery Co. in Japan and published in the Bulletin of Foreign Plant Introductions in 1918. Plants from the collection were grown and fruited in Chico, California and in Brooksville, Florida by David Fairchild. M. rubra is being commercialized in California by Calmei, a California corporation. Trees are prolific producers, with a single tree yielding some of fruit. As of 2007, 865,000 acres were devoted to yangmei production in Chinadouble the amount of acres utilized in apple production in the United States. The tree is used as ornaments for parks and streets. It is also a traditional tree used in composing classical East Asian gardens. =Products= Some cultivars with large fruit, up to in diameter, have been developed. Besides fresh consumption, the fruits may be dried, canned, soaked in baijiu (Chinese liquor), or fermented into alcoholic beverages, such as wine, beer, or cocktails. Dried fruits are often prepared in the manner of dry huamei (Prunus mume with flavorings such as licorice or salty licorice). The juice has been commercialised under the brand name \\"Yumberry\\" under which name it is trademarked in the EU. In Yunnan Province in China, there are two main types of yangmei, a sour type used for making dried fruit and a sweet type used for juice and fresh eating. Other uses include * bottled pasteurized juice or juice blends * dye prepared from the bark * yogurt flavoring * blended jam and preserves =Research and phytochemicals= Various species of Myrica have been studied scientifically for horticultural characteristics or phytochemicals implicated with health benefits. Dating to 1951, the horticultural literature includes studies on * nitrogen-fixing ability of the root nodules system * presence of Frankia bacteria having nitrogen-fixing properties in root nodules * microbial characteristics of the subcanopy soil * niche characteristics in the forest environment * growth of pollen tubes Cultural significance Archaeological and written evidence suggest that yangmei cultivation first took place in China over 2,000 years ago during the Han Dynasty. Yangmei is mentioned throughout Chinese literature, including several appearances in Li Bai's poems. In Japan, it is the prefectural flower of K≈çchi and the prefectural tree of Tokushima. The plant's name appears in many old Japanese poems.

The film was directed by James Seale. Plot Physics professor Zach Shefford (Grayson McCouch) has regarded his telekinetic gifts as a curse rather than a blessing. This sentiment is obviously not shared by ruthless Pentagon agent Raymond Addison (Louis Gossett Jr.), who recruits Shefford for a dangerous mission in which his \\"second sight\\" talents will be taxed to the utmost. It seems that, back in 1977, Addison had overseen Project Momentum, wherein dozens of telekinetics were brought together ostensibly for the purpose of benefiting mankind. But the project got out of hand when the participants' powers became too powerful and deadly, forcing Addison to kill them all. However, one of the participants, Adrian Geiger (Michael Massee), managed to escape, and is now at large, with a vast telekinetic army at his beck and call. It is Shefford's job to infiltrate Geiger's camp and finish the job that Addison had started.

This game was based on Holistic's in-house role playing game Fading Suns. The game had a wide array of units and a complex back-story but was rushed to market and released with numerous severe flaws and several features underdeveloped. In patched form, it survives as a popular abandonware title with numerous unofficial, fan-made mods. On October 19th, 2020, it was made available on GOG.com. Gameplay The game is played on a galactic map and specific planet maps. Planet maps use a hexa-grid system for movement. Individual units and buildings take up a single grid space. Several menus handle diplomacy, chat, and documentation. In the game, the player controls a feudal lord of a noble house amongst the ruins of a galactic empire. The player must battle other noble houses and rally enough support to be crowned Emperor of the galaxy. The player can start as one of five houses; each has its own advantages and disadvantages. During game setup, the player can customize their house, taking some negative traits such as insanity in exchange for more positive traits, like having all the player's units start out better trained. Each house starts on its respective home planet, and houses starting on temperate planets have an early-game advantage over houses that start on frozen or jungle planets. There are several non-player groups in the game, including the Symbiots, Vau, the Guild, and the Church. In total, there are forty-three planets that can be explored, colonized, and fought over. Reception Next Generation rated it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"With everything from basic combat to diplomatic backstabbing, Emperor of the Fading Suns has a depth of play that is worthy of a classic strategy game.\\" Personal Computer Magazine described the game as \\"destined to be a classic\\" in their 1997 review, but also noted that the game suffered from bugs. Legacy After the end-of-support by the developer, the fan-community took over the support by creating player-made unofficial patches for the game. These try to fix bugs and/or enhance the game by adding new units and balancing out old ones (modding). For example, the \\"Hyperion patch\\" makes it possible for the Symbiots to build additional organic spaceships, so they are not stranded on their home planet if their initial fleet is destroyed.Hyperion patch on twarriors.comNova patch References External links * Official Webpage (archived in 1998) * Official SegaSoft Webpage (archived in 1997) * Category:1997 video games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Computer wargames Category:4X video games Category:Holistic Design games Category:North America- exclusive video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games based on tabletop role-playing games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Emperor of the Fading Suns"},{"id":"1922737","title":"The Widow (song)"},{"id":"1922740","text":"Mark Taylor (born 27 February 1973) is a former Wales national rugby union team player who played at centre.

History West University Place Pershing Junior High School, which was named after John J. Pershing, was established in 1928. Pershing originally was connected to West University Elementary School (which was located in the city of West University Place after the city incorporated in 1938); the school moved to its own campus at 7000 Braes Boulevard in Houston in 1949.Viren, Sarah. \\"It won't be strictly \`old school' at Pershing now / Emotions mixed as students leave vintage campus for all-new digs.\\" Houston Chronicle.

This proposal was favored by those zoned to Jane Long Middle School but it was opposed by those zoned to Pershing as they did not want to lose access to the school. The Gordon proposal ultimately did not happen.McAdams, p. 58. \\"Bellaire residents who lived east of the 610 loop were zoned to Pershing Middle School\\" Pershing had, in March 2002, a waiting list of 1,000 students for 120 places. Originally, Houston ISD planned to remodel Pershing's 1949 campus. When HISD found that building a new campus from scratch would be more cost-effective, HISD decided to pursue that goal. Construction started on Pershing's brand new two-story campus at 3838 Bluebonnet (on the same site as the old campus) during the summer of 2005. Construction was expected to end in Summer 2007, and the new campus was originally expected to open in Fall 2007 . The lead architect for the campus was PGAL, with Gilbane as the lead project manager. The original budget was $16,900,000 United States dollars. The construction costs totaled $24.4 million, and the final costs, including books, computers, and architect engineers, totaled $31 million. The previous campus had a capacity of 1,500 students; because enrollment was 1,700 as of fall 2004 Pershing had to cap enrollment of the 6th and 7th grades. The school district had to adjust its plans for Pershing's campus due to the unexpected surge in enrollment. The new building was built on the previous athletic fields, and the previous building was to close after the opening of the new one. After demolition of the previous building, the new athletic fields would go on its former site. The new building opened on Thursday, January 18, 2007; originally the building was slated to open the previous day, but weather conditions lead to the temporary closing of all HISD schools for January 17.

The station was owned by Shaw Communications under its cable systems unit, and was not part of the Shaw Media unit which was sold to Corus Entertainment in 2016. CJBN's studios were based alongside Shaw's local offices on 10th and Front Streets in Keewatin, and its transmitter was located near Norman Dam Road in Kenora. The station was carried on Shaw Cable channel 12, Bell Satellite TV channel 224 and Shaw Direct channel 320. It was, with just 178 watts of power, the lowest-powered television station operating on a regular license in North America. This distinction(which excludes repeaters of other Canadian networks, especially those affiliated with CBC Television and CBC North) was formerly tied with KJWY in Jackson, Wyoming (now WDPN-TV in Wilmington, Delaware/Philadelphia), until that station increased its power to 270 watts at the time of the digital television transition in the U.S. It was therefore the lowest-powered Canadian television station affiliated with a major network. Its main method of distribution was via sister company Shaw Cable, and other cable and satellite services. In a letter to the CRTC on November 30, 2016, Shaw Communications announced it would not renew the station's license and intended to close the station on January 27, 2017. History CJBN-TV first signed on the air in 1980, with a transmitter power output of 17.5 watts; the station was started by local businessmen Carl Johnson and Bertil Nilson. It was co-owned with Norcom Telecommunications, whose cable systems served Kenora and surrounding areas. With a potential audience of only 5,800 households, it was Canada's smallest television market. It remains the smallest designated market area in Canada, and the second smallest in North America (behind Glendive, Montana). The station came about after Norcom applied to operate a Central Time Zone Satellite Relay Distribution System (SRDU), and as such, needed a CTV signal. Winnipeg's CKY-TV, which was the closest CTV affiliate to Kenora, was unavailable, so Norcom applied for, and was successful in gaining their own CTV station. The company also planned to set up a series of rebroadcasting stations to expand into nearby areas, but when Cancom secured the main licence for the Northern Service uplink, Norcom was left with just CJBN. With the local economy dependent on the pulp and paper industry, the station's future remained precarious, especially with the increase of competing satellite services available in the area. In 1983, the station proposed setting up rebroadcast transmitters in nearby communities: * CJBN-TV-1 Dryden * CJBN-TV-2 Fort Frances * CJBN-TV-3 Sioux Lookout * CJBN-TV-4 Ignace * CJBN-TV-5 Red Lake * CJBN-TV-6 Ear Falls In 1985, CJBN-TV increased its power to 177.5 watts. In 1988, the station told the CRTC that they could not afford to construct the rebroadcast transmitters, and would remain with just one transmitter in Kenora. In place of the rebroadcast transmitters, the station was carried on cable in Red Lake, Sioux Lookout and Ear Falls, and later on, was added to the cable systems in most towns in Northwestern Ontario, including Dryden, Fort Frances, and Ignace. In 1999, the station was brought before the CRTC to explain the lack of Canadian content, but two years later, its licence was renewed, once evidence of renewed effort toward Canadian content was proven. In 2000, CJBN started to brand itself as \\"CJTV\\", but would revert to the CJBN- TV designation after its purchase by Shaw Communications. And in 2004, cable systems in nearby areas and national satellite services began to carry CJBN. On August 9, 2006, Shaw Communications announced an agreement to purchase Norcom, including CJBN.Shaw Communications to Acquire Norcom Telecommunications Limited, Shaw press release, August 9, 2006 As Shaw itself did not previously own any broadcast assets,At the time, however, the Shaw family controlled three broadcast television stations, all CBC affiliates, through Corus Entertainment. there was some speculation that the struggling CJBN would be resold to CTV to become a repeater of CKY-TV (Shaw had itself sold CKY to CTV following a similar acquisition in 2001). However, the company decided to keep CJBN. CRTC approval of the sale was announced in November 2006.Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2006-152 Shaw Cable-tv Winnipeg announced in April 2007 that it would add CJBN to the digital signals offered to Winnipeg subscribers and placed CJBN on ch. 68. Shaw Communications acquired Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the Global Television Network, in 2010. In response to deficiency questions from the CRTC regarding its application to acquire those assets, made public in July 2010, Shaw stated that it had no plans to disaffiliate CJBN from CTV and make the Kenora station a full Global O&O.; The cable provider said it would negotiate to extend CJBN's affiliation agreement with CTV, which was set to expire on August 31, 2010, at the time.CRTC application 2010-0550-5, accessible via Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2010-498, July 22, 2010. Retrieved August 6, 2010. However, on December 1, 2011, CJBN dropped all CTV programming and became a full Global station, adopting a schedule similar to nearby Global station CKND-DT in Winnipeg. As a result of the switch, CJBN became a de facto Global owned-and-operated station, even as it was the only Shaw-owned television station that was owned by the company outright rather than Shaw Media, but the station did not call itself \\"Global Kenora\\" under the branding conventions of the network's other O&O; stations, identifying instead by its callsign (in the manner of privately owned Canadian television stations). Kenora cable subscribers, both analog and digital, continue to have access to CTV programming through CKY-DT, which was carried on Shaw's basic cable service in Kenora and area on CJBN's previous cable channel positions (including channel 4 in Kenora), with CJBN relocated to cable 12, the channel position previously used by CKND. CJBN was not included in the 2016 sale of Shaw Media (including the Global network and most of its stations) to Corus Entertainment. (See Appendix in Doc1 - Cover Letter, which does not list CJBN as one of the licences being transferred) It remained under Shaw Communications ownership and was therefore technically a Global affiliate, but remained a de facto O&O; insofar as both Shaw Communications and Corus are controlled by the family of JR Shaw. On November 30, 2016, Shaw announced the closure of the station, citing duplication with CKND. In a letter filed to the CRTC, Shaw stated that it was in the process of notifying the affected parties of the closure. The company also said that CJBN's two locally produced programs, Fishing with Gussy and Good Morning Sunset Country, will continue to air locally on Shaw TV Kenora. Three jobs have been affected by the closure, which occurred on January 27, 2017. Programming As of its closure, the station carried a similar schedule to CKND-DT, the Global-owned station in Winnipeg, including its local newscasts, with the exception of CJBN airing shows such as local production The Weekend Adventurer and Urban Rush. The station was examined by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 1999 for not airing enough Canadian content. Since this occurred, the station aired the required amount of Canadian programming. From the station's launch until its disaffiliation from CTV in 2011, the station's programming was primarily sourced from CTV, with the remainder of the schedule rounded out by Global and syndicated programming, although the exact balance varied from season to season. As with many smaller independently owned Canadian stations, there were also several infomercials throughout any given day's schedule. Newscasts and local programming Despite being the only full-fledged station in the area, CJBN never produced much local content. A full-fledged news department was not considered feasible for the station due to the market's small population. Instead, the stations simulcast most local news programs produced by Global- owned Winnipeg sister station CKND-DT (with the exception of that station's weekend 6 p.m. newscast). For many years, the station's only newscasts were two-minute segments, which were combined into a review program at the end of the week. In 2008, CJBN began airing a news and issues show called Points North which aired eight times per week: Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings at 6:30 and 11:30 p.m., and weekend evenings at 6:30 p.m. It also aired other special programs aimed at tourists and local residents. In late 2011, Points North became a lifestyles show and its airtime was cut back to weekend evenings at 6:30 p.m. The show was later cancelled in February 2013 to make way for The Weekend Adventurer, which launched in April 2013. CJBN also aired a half-hour regional news program, Northwest Newsweek, which was produced in Thunder Bay by Thunder Bay Television. CNN anchor Ashleigh Banfield began her career at the station. On May 20, 2016, CJBN aired its final 2-minute news update. This update was used to announce a new local morning program that began airing on CJBN on June 3, 2016, called Good Morning Sunset Country. This morning show aired on Fridays at 8:30 a.m. and covered Northwestern Ontario news as well as featured local guests. Digital television CJBN was not required to participate in the mandatory digital conversion that took place in most larger markets on August 31, 2011. The station never converted to digital as of the closedown of their operations on January 27, 2017.

The Social Contract helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in Europe, especially in France. The Social Contract argued against the idea that monarchs were divinely empowered to legislate. Rousseau asserts that only the people, who are sovereign, have that all-powerful right. Overview Title page of a pirated edition of the Social Contract, probably printed in Germany.R.A. Leigh, Unsolved Problems in the Bibliography of J.-J. Rousseau (Cambridge, 1990), plate 22. The epigraph of the work is \\"foederis aequas / Dicamus leges\\" (Virgil, Aeneid XI.321‚Äì22). The stated aim of The Social Contract is to determine whether there can be a legitimate political authority, since people's interactions he saw at his time seemed to put them in a state far worse than the good one they were at in the state of nature, even though living in isolation. He concludes book one, chapter three with, \\"Let us then admit that force does not create right, and that we are obliged to obey only legitimate powers\\", which is to say, the ability to coerce is not a legitimate power, and there is no rightful duty to submit to it. A state has no right to enslave a conquered people. In this desired social contract, everyone will be free because they all forfeit the same number of rights and impose the same duties on all. Rousseau argues that it is absurd for a man to surrender his freedom for slavery; thus, the participants must have a right to choose the laws under which they live. Although the contract imposes new laws, including those safeguarding and regulating property, there are restrictions on how that property can be legitimately claimed. His example with land includes three conditions; that the land be uninhabited, that the owner claims only what is needed for subsistence, and that labour and cultivation give the possession legitimacy. Rousseau posits that the political aspects of a society should be divided into two parts. First, there must be a sovereign consisting of the whole population, which included women (in a way that was not practiced by almost all countries and so was quite revolutionary to suggest), that represents the general will and is the legislative power within the state. The second division is that of the government, being distinct from the sovereign. This division is necessary because the sovereign cannot deal with particular matters like applications of the law. Doing so would undermine its generality, and therefore damage its legitimacy. Thus, the government must remain a separate institution from the sovereign body. When the government exceeds the boundaries set in place by the people, it is the mission of the people to abolish such government, and begin anew. Rousseau claims that the size of the territory to be governed often decides the nature of the government. Since a government is only as strong as the people, and this strength is absolute, the larger the territory, the more strength the government must be able to exert over the populace. In his view, a monarchical government is able to wield the most power over the people since it has to devote less power to itself, while a democracy the least. In general, the larger the bureaucracy, the more power required for government discipline. Normally, this relationship requires the state to be an aristocracy or monarchy. When Rousseau uses the word democracy, he refers to a direct democracy rather than a representative democracy. In light of the relation between population size and governmental structure, Rousseau argues that like his native Geneva, small city-states are the form of nation in which freedom can best flourish. For states of this size, an elected aristocracy is preferable, and in very large states a benevolent monarch; but even monarchical rule, to be legitimate, must be subordinate to the sovereign rule of law.  Reception  The French philosopher Voltaire used his publications to criticise and mock Rousseau, but also to defend free expression. In his Id√©es r√©publicaines (1765), he reacted to the news that The Social Contract had been burned in Geneva, saying \\"The operation of burning it was perhaps as odious as that of writing it. [‚Ä¶] To burn a book of argument is to say: 'We do not have enough wit to reply to it.'\\" The work was also banned in Paris. The work received a refutation called The Confusion of the Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau by the Jesuit Alfonso Muzzarelli in Italy in 1794.

He played in Major League Baseball as a left- handed pitcher, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds. Vander Meer is most notable for being the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters. After the impressive start to his major league career, he experienced problems controlling the accuracy of his pitching, and his later career was marked by inconsistent performances. Baseball career Born in Prospect Park, New Jersey, he moved with his family to Midland Park, New Jersey in 1918.Coutros, Evonne. \\"Midland Park marking 75th anniversary of Johnny Vander Meer's double no-hitters\\", The Record (Bergen County), April 8, 2013. Accessed January 27, 2015. \\"Born Nov. 2, 1914, Vander Meer was an athlete from the time he was in elementary school. His father, Jacob ‚Äî who worked at Paterson's United Piece and Dye Works ‚Äî and mother, Katie, lived in Prospect Park until 1918, when they moved to their first home in Midland Park on Rea Avenue.\\" He had an inauspicious start to his professional baseball career. He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1933 and assigned to the Dayton Ducks. Dayton then sold his contract to a Boston Bees minor league affiliate, the Scranton Miners of the New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League. The Miners found his playing ability to be lacking and sent him to the Cincinnati Reds affiliate, the Nashville Volunteers, in a trade for Tiny Chaplin. From Nashville, he was sent to the Durham Bulls, where the Bulls manager and catcher, Johnny Gooch, was credited with helping control the wildness of Vander Meer's pitching. In 1936, he posted a record of 19 wins against six losses for Durham. Vander Meer in 1940 Vander Meer made his major league debut with the Cincinnati Reds on April 22, 1937 at the age of 22. He went 3‚Äì4 before being sent back to the minor leagues with the Syracuse Chiefs for most of the season when the Reds recalled him in September. The following year on June 11, 1938, Vander Meer pitched a no-hitter against the Boston Bees. Four days later against the Brooklyn Dodgers in what was the first night game ever held at Ebbets Field, he threw another no-hitter, becoming the only player in major league history to throw two straight no-hitters, a historic record that has never been tied and almost certainly will never be beaten. Vander Meer's performance earned him the role as the starting pitcher for the National League team in the 1938 All-Star game held at Cincinnati's Crosley Field. The American League team ‚Äì having won four of the previous five All- Star games ‚Äì was favored to win the game, but Vander Meer pitched three scoreless innings and allowed only one hit, as the National League went on to win 4‚Äì1. He ended the season with a 15‚Äì10 record and a 3.12 earned run average for the fourth place Reds. He might have won more games, but spent nearly a month in the hospital being treated for boils late in the season. After his impressive rookie season, Vander Meer had a disappointing 1939 season, when he fell ill during spring training, and then suffered an injury when he slipped on a wet pitching mound in Pittsburgh. He posted a 5‚Äì9 record and an earned run average of 4.67. Early in the 1940 season, he began to experience problems controlling the accuracy of his pitches. In June, the Reds released him back to the minor leagues where he played for the Indianapolis Indians and went 6‚Äì4. He returned to the major leagues in September and posted a 3‚Äì1 record, including a 12-inning victory against Philadelphia on September 18, that clinched the National League pennant for the Reds. In the 13th inning, Vander Meer hit a double, advanced to third base on a sacrifice fly, then scored the winning run on a squeeze bunt. In the 1940 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, Vander Meer made only one appearance when he entered Game 5 in the fifth inning with the Reds trailing 7‚Äì0. He pitched three scoreless innings as the Reds lost 8‚Äì0. The Reds went on to win the series in seven games. It would be the only post-season appearance of Vander Meer's career. In 1941, Vander Meer's performance improved somewhat with a 16‚Äì12 record and six shutouts while leading the league with 202 strikeouts. On June 6, 1941 in a game against Philadelphia, he allowed only one hit. Vander Meer later recalled that the only hit in the game could have been ruled an error, as shortstop Eddie Joost fielded the ground ball, then dropped it before throwing to first base. He earned his third All-Star selection in the 1942 All-Star Game, and once again threw three scoreless innings in a 3‚Äì1 loss to the American League. He finished the 1942 season with a career-high 18 wins against 12 losses and once again led the league in strikeouts. He posted a 15‚Äì16 record in 1943 for the second place Reds and led the league in strikeouts for a third consecutive year. On March 3, 1944, Vander Meer joined the United States Navy and was stationed at Sampson Naval Training Station in New York where he would play for the Navy baseball team. He was discharged from the Navy in December 1945, having lost two years of his major league career to his military service, but Vander Meer claimed that his extensive military play made him less wild as a pitcher, which his record partially supports. The 31-year-old pitcher returned to play for the Reds in 1946 although he was not able to recapture his previous form. Vander Meer was an incidental witness when his Cincinnati teammate Ewell Blackwell almost duplicated his consecutive no-hit feat in 1947, by pitching a no-hitter against the Braves, then in his next appearance held the Dodgers without a hit until the ninth inning when he gave up two hits. He produced one more notable season in 1948 when he went 17‚Äì14, before his contract was sold to the Chicago Cubs in February 1950. After an ineffective year with the Cubs, he was released in March 1951 and was signed as a free agent by the Cleveland Indians. He appeared in only one game for the Indians on May 7, 1951 before being released on June 30, 1951 at the age of 36. Vander Meer returned to the minor leagues where he played for five more seasons until the age of 40. In 1952, 14 years after his consecutive no- hitters, Vander Meer pitched a no-hitter for the Tulsa Oilers against the Beaumont Roughnecks in the Texas League. Career statistics A four-time All-Star, Vander Meer compiled a 119‚Äì121 record with 1,294 strikeouts and a 3.44 ERA in 2,104‚Öî innings over a 13-year Major League career. He had 29 career shutouts, ranking third on the Reds franchise list. His 1,251 strikeouts with the Reds were the team record at the time of his retirement in 1951. Along with Dizzy Dean (1932‚Äì35), Warren Spahn (1949‚Äì52), Randy Johnson (1999‚Äì2002), Tim Lincecum (2008‚Äì10), and Max Scherzer (2016‚Äì18), Vander Meer is one of only six NL pitchers since 1930 to lead the league in strikeouts in three straight seasons (1941‚Äì43). Later life After retiring as a player at the age of 40, Vander Meer became a minor league manager in the Cincinnati Reds organization for ten seasons before retiring in 1962. After his retirement from baseball, he worked for a brewing company. He was inducted as part of the inaugural class into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1958. He died of an abdominal aneurysm at his home in Tampa, Florida, on October 6, 1997 at the age of 82.

In October 1968, after being drafted by the Denver Broncos of the American Football League (AFL), he became the first black starting quarterback in professional American football and established a Denver rookie record of 14 touchdown passes that season. He played professionally for nine years. College Career From Omaha, Nebraska, Briscoe played high school football at Omaha South High School and college football at Omaha University from 1963 to 1967. The year after he graduated, his college changed their name to University of Nebraska at Omaha. Playing at quarterback, Briscoe led his team to a 27-11 record and three conference titles. He left with 22 school records, including completion percentage (55%), passing yards (4,935), touchdown passes (52), and total offensive yards (6,253). Briscoe was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2016.https://www.unomaha.edu/news/2016/09/marlin-briscoe-the- magician-the-maverick.php Professional career Briscoe was 5-foot-10 and 177 pounds when the AFL's Broncos took him in the 14th round of the 1968 draft at the age of 22. The Broncos intended to convert Briscoe to cornerback, but Briscoe had negotiated for a chance to compete for the quarterback position. On September 29, 1968, starter Steve Tensi suffered a broken collarbone, and backup Joe DiVito was spotty. Head coach Lou Saban summoned Briscoe from the sidelines in the fourth quarter against the Boston Patriots to give him a try. Briscoe's first play was a 22-yard completion. On his second series he orchestrated an 80-yard touchdown drive. He completed a 21-yard pass and ran for 38 more himself, carrying it the last 12 yards for the score. A week later, on October 6, he became the first starting African-American quarterback in the AFL. Briscoe threw 14 touchdown passes that year in just 5 starts, including 4 on Nov 24 against Buffalo; both are still Broncos rookie records. He also threw for 335 yards in that game, a rookie record that stood until John Elway broke it in 1983, and one of only three 300+ yard rookie games in franchise history. He completed 41.5 percent of his passes, and averaged 7.1 yards per attempt and his 17.1 yards per completion led the American Football League (and ranks 18th all-time). He also ran for 308 yards and three touchdowns. Before the 1969 season started, Briscoe, still determined to play quarterback, discovered that head coach Saban intended to use Pete Liske as the starter, so he asked to be released.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YEYtAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=b58FAAAAIBAJ&pg;=875,3300323&dq;=marlin- briscoe+broncos+waived&hl;=en He went to the AFL's Buffalo Bills where he was turned into a receiver, since the Bills already had superstar Jack Kemp, former Pro Bowler Tom Flores, and James Harris, another black quarterback with a more prototypical 6-foot-4 and 210-pound frame. Briscoe never played quarterback again, but he enjoyed a splendid career. He led Buffalo in touchdown catches in each of his three seasons there and in receptions twice. In 1970 he was in the top two in receptions and receiving yards and became an All-Pro. After the AFL-NFL merger, he played in the National Football League from 1970 though 1976, mostly with American Football Conference teams. In 1971, the Bills traded Briscoe to the Miami Dolphins for a first-round draft pick Joe Delamielleure, who developed as a Hall of Fame guard. Briscoe went on to win a pair of Super Bowls. Briscoe led the undefeated 1972 team with four touchdown receptions and was the leading receiver on the Dolphins in 1973, catching more passes than future Pro Football Hall of Famer, Paul Warfield. Briscoe made stops with the San Diego Chargers, and Detroit Lions before ending his career in 1976 with the New England Patriots. He had 10 receptions for 136 yards and 1 touchdown in 14 regular season games for the New England Patriots in 1976. He caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from Steve Grogan in the Patriots 48-17 rout of the Oakland Raiders at Schaefer Stadium on October 3, 1976. Early in his career, Briscoe was intercepted by Boston Patriots AFL All Star Defensive Back Leroy Mitchell in Denver's 35-14 rout of the Patriots at Fenway Park on November 3, 1968. He is the only player to have been intercepted by a Patriot player and later to have caught a touchdown as a Patriot receiver. Retirement and legacy Upon retirement from professional sports, Briscoe moved to Los Angeles. He became established as a successful financial broker, dealing in municipal bonds. Briscoe was affected by the 1980s cocaine epidemic, becoming addicted, but recovered after extensive rehab. In the 21st century, he worked as the director of the Boys and Girls Club in Long Beach, California before retiring. He founded a football camp for children. A biopic film titled The Magician, based on Briscoe's life, has been under development for several years. Canadian actor Lyriq Bent has been approached to portray Briscoe in the film. In 2016, the University of Nebraska Omaha, Briscoe's alma mater, honored him by unveiling a statue.

He is a member of supergroup Saint Asonia and played in the band Newsted. Life and career Mushok was born in Ludlow, Massachusetts on April 10, 1970. He formed Staind in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1995 with Aaron Lewis, Johnny April, and Jon Wysocki. In 1997, before Staind was set to perform an opening concert set, headlining band Limp Bizkit's frontman Fred Durst confronted them regarding seemingly Satanic cover artwork on their debut album Tormented. The band convinced Durst that the image did not convey devil worship and their performance that evening impressed him enough that he signed them to Flip Records. Staind released the albums Dysfunction in 1999, Break the Cycle in 2001, 14 Shades of Grey in 2003, Chapter V in 2005, The Singles: 1996‚Äì2006 in 2006, The Illusion of Progress in 2008, and their self-titled album in 2011 before going on hiatus in 2012. In 2014, Staind began to tour again briefly before going on a second hiatus. They reunited for a one-off set in August 2017 and again on an ongoing basis in September 2019. In 2013, Mushok joined heavy metal band Newsted, fronted by former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted. After Newsted disbanded in 2014, Mushok joined Saint Asonia in 2015. Playing style and influences Mushok has a distinctive playing style. He is known for using baritone guitars and experimenting with tunings, but also uses standard guitars, which are most of the time tuned to D# standard. In addition to guitar, Mushok also has performed spoken-word vocals on the Staind album Tormented. He cites Tony MacAlpine (his guitar teacher), Eddie Van Halen, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Johnson, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Dimebag Darrell among his guitar influences. Equipment Mushok performing in 2013 =Guitars= Mike is well known for using baritone guitars made by PRS and Ibanez tuned down to Drop G# with the second string tuned up a half-step to F#(G#D#G#C#F#A#) as well as Double Drop G# (G#C#G#C#F#A#) on some songs, and has had signature guitars made for him by both companies. His signature PRS baritone guitar was released in 2009 and was available in silverburst and brown sunburst finishes, while his signature Ibanez, the MMM1, baritone guitar had been released in 2003-2007 and had a neck-thru design. He also used a custom seven-string guitar tuned to (F#C#G#C#F#A#D#) on the Staind self-titled album as well as the debut Saint Asonia album. =Amplifiers= Throughout his career, Mushok has used various Marshall, Rivera, and Diezel amplifiers, as well as Marshall speaker cabinets. =Effects= Mushok uses a Lexicon Rackmount Multi-Effects Processor for the vast majority of his effects, including phase shifting, flanging, and delay. The only pedals he has really used are a Boss OC-3 Super Octave pedal and a Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor. Personal life Mushok is married and has two children and a hand full of dogs.

It is the first all-stone, white granite temple to be built in the western hemisphere whose construction began in 1990. The Iraivan Temple is located next to the Wailua River and 8 km from Mount Waialeale. It is maintained by the Saiva Siddhanta Church which is also known as Kauai Aadheenam and Kauai's Hindu Monastery. The temple is under construction. Spatika (Crystal) Lingam will be housed in it after its construction completes, till then crystal Lingam is placed in the Kadavul temple.The centerpiece of the temple will be a 700-pound, 39-inch-tall, uncut quartz crystal, believed to be the largest six-sided, single-pointed crystal ever found Sri Trichy Mahaswamigal (d. 2005) of Kailash Ashram, Bangalore, describes the temple's importance: \\"The Iraivan Temple is going to be to America what the temples of Chidambaram, Madurai, Rameshwaram, and other great Siva temples are to India.\\" History Iraivan Temple was inspired by a vision of Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, on February 15, 1975, in which he saw Lord Shiva walking on the land where the temple is now located. It is intended as a place of pilgrimage for Hindus worldwide. Subramuniyaswami set three parameters for its design and construction: * that it follow traditional design according to the Saiva ƒÄgama * that it be designed to last 1,000 years * that it be entirely carved by hand, without the use of any machinery. The temple design was completed by V. Ganapati Sthapati in the late 1980s. Carving of the 4,000-plus blocks of granite commenced in 1990 at a worksite in Bangalore, India and then transported to temple site at Kauai. Beginning in 2001, the stone were shipped to Kauai and assembly begun by a team of silpi temple carvers under the direction of a master architect or sthapati. The 3.2 million pound temple is expected to be completed in a few years. Two Indian swamis: Sri Sivaratnapuri Mahaswamigal (popularly known as Tiruchi Swami) and Sri Balagangadharanatha are assistting with the project and in 1990 provided eleven acres of land outside Bangalore. Architecture Artist's conception of Iraivan Temple The temple is a Chola-Style temple and possesses a number of rare architectural features. The first is that it is being carved entirely by hand. Craftsmen follow and preserve traditional methods, shaping the stone with small hammers and utilizing over 70 types of chisels. The second feature is the foundation is made of a crack-free, 7,000-psi formula using \\"fly ash,\\" a by-product of coal burning. Fly ash consists of inorganic, incombustible matter present in the coal that has been fused during combustion into a glassy structure. The foundation was designed by Dr. Kumar Mehta, a materials scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the first project to demonstrate his theories on the use of fly ash in concrete. The third set of features are exhibitions of the stone carver's craft. The foremost of these are two sets of \\"musical pillars\\" whose tall rods are designed to resonate precise musical tones when struck with a mallet. Others include six stone lions carved into the pillars each of which contains a stone ball freely rotatable in its mouth but not removable, a large stone bell, and stone chains with loose links. Pillared Mandapam inside the templeThe temple is facing south and built according to vastu science. Vastu architecture aims at creating a space that will elevate the vibration of the individual to resonate with the vibration of the built space, which in turn is in tune with universal space. The whole space of the temple is defined in multiples and fractions of one unit, and 71/4 inches. Pillars through the temple are spaced and structured to serve as energy points for the building. Iraivan Temple will be completely free of electricity for mystical reasons, as decreed by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. The main murti, or worshipful icon, is a rare spathika Sivalinga, a pointed, six-faced 700-pound clear quartz crystal. In the early 1980s, Subramuniyaswami had been seeing the crystal in his dreams. He found it in 1987 and brought it to Kauai. The stone, estimated to be 50 million years old, was not cut out of rock by a miner. Instead, it was found in a perfect state encased in mud, probably harvested from its original outcropping by an earthquake. The quartz crystal (sphatika) of the Sivalinga is considered specially sacred because it represents the element akasha. Current status The construction of the main pavilion is complete, and a few other ancillary structures are being worked on. The temple is expected to be inaugurated with a maha kumbha abhishekam in a few years. The current head of the project is Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami, leader of the monastery and successor to the founder.

Each species is adapted to the specific environment which it inhabits, but all species of the genus share certain anatomical and metabolic traits, reflecting their common evolutionary ancestry. Pachypodium species vary widely in general form, or habit. The genus contains species ranging from the bottle-shaped Pachypodium baronii to the cigar-like Pachypodium lamerei to the branchless dwarf species Pachypodium brevicaule. Most species, however, are shrub or tree-like, ranging in height from 5 m or less to as much as 12 m. All species save one have spines on their branchlets, which are a modified form of stipule; some species have spines in other locations as well. In African species, the spines are clustered in groups of three, two large spines and one small one in the middle. In other species, the spines come in groups of two. The length of the spines varies from 1 to 75 mm. The wood of Pachypodium species is soft and cream-colored; their bark is, on average, 6 mm thick, and often smooth. It ranges in color from dark brown to pale grey to green-grey. In cross section, it is usually green in color. The leaves may be either sessile‚Äîgrowing directly from the stem‚Äîor petiolate‚Äîgrowing from a leaf-stalk. They are typically confined to the apices of branchlets, branches, or the trunk. In most species, leaves range from slightly hairy to smooth on top and densely hairy to smooth beneath. Leaf shape varies, but, in all but one species, upcurving secondary veins are apparent. Pachypodium inflorescence, or clusters of flowers, appear either at the end of the stem, growing directly off the stem, or attached to the stem by branchlets. The bracts, or leaves surrounding the inflorescence, resemble sepals. Flower stalks range in length from 0 to 56 mm. Pachypodium flowers always consist of five sepals, ranging in shape from ovate to oblong. The flower is tubular, sometimes narrowing at the top, and varies in color; various shades off red, white, and yellow appear in different species. A hairy belt of varying width appears above the stamens. The tube of the flower varies in length from 9 to 60 mm across the genus. The ovary of the flower is composed of two carpels, each containing numerous ovules. All but two species in the genus have stamens within the flower. When pollinated, the flower produces a pale to dark brown fruit composed of two separate mericaps, which is whitish to pale brown inside when dried. The seeds are pale to medium brown, with a lighter spot on their apex. All pachypodium species share certain basic characteristics; they use enlarged, spine protected trunks for water storage, enabling them to inhabit dry microenvironments. There is, however, substantial variation on these basic characteristics, and no single shape or pattern of branching is shared by the entire genus. In general, branching is flexible even within a species, allowing each individual specimen to develop as best suits its microenvironment. This adaptability allows pachpyodium plants to occupy marginal microenvironments which provide only limited means of survival.

It is classified as a triarylmethane dye and is known under various names, such as FD&C; Blue No. 1 or Acid Blue 9. It is denoted by E number E133 and has a color index of 42090. It has the appearance of a blue powder and is soluble in water and glycerol, with a maximum absorption at about 628 nanometers. It is one of the oldest FDA-approved color additives and is generally considered nontoxic and safe. Production Brilliant Blue FCF is synthetic dye produced by the condensation of 2-formylbenzenesulfonic acid and the appropriate aniline followed by oxidation. It can be combined with tartrazine (E102) to produce various shades of green. It is usually a disodium salt. The diammonium salt has CAS number . Calcium and potassium salts are also permitted. It can also appear as an aluminum lake. The chemical formation is C37H34N2Na2O9S3. Related dyes are C.I. acid green 3 (CAS#4680-78-8) and acid green 9 (CAS#4857-81-2). In these dyes, the 2-sulfonic acid group is replaced by H and Cl, respectively. Many attempts have been made to find similarly colored natural dyes that are as stable as Brilliant Blue FCF. Blue pigments must possess many chemical traits, including pi-bond conjugation, aromatic rings, heteroatoms and heteroatom groups, and ionic charges in order to absorb low energy red light. Most natural blue dyes are either unstable, blue only in alkaline conditions, or toxic; good candidates for further research into use as natural dyes include anthocyanin and trichotomine derivatives. No replacement for Brilliant Blue FCF has been found for use in beverages. Blue and red Jolly Rancher candy. The blue color is Brilliant Blue FCF dye Applications Vodka with Blue Cura√ßao syrup Like many other color additives, the primary use of Blue No. 1 is to correct or enhance natural coloring or to give colorless compounds a vivid hue. In the United States, of the two approved blue dyes (the other being Indigo carmine, or FD&C; Blue #2), Brilliant Blue FCF is the more common of the two. As a blue color, Brilliant Blue FCF is often found in cotton candy, ice cream, canned processed peas, packet soups, bottled food colorings, icings, ice pops, blueberry flavored products, children's medications, dairy products, sweetsNestle Aero packet ingredients listing barcode: 7613031579334 soft drinks, and drinks, especially the liqueur Blue Cura√ßao. It is also used in soaps, shampoos, mouthwash and other hygiene and cosmetics applications. Brilliant Blue FCF is extensively used as a water tracer agent. Due to its ability to retain color for long periods of time, Brilliant Blue FCF outperforms other dye tracers. Additionally, Brilliant Blue FCF has a low toxicity level that is favorable for the environment. However, Brilliant Blue FCF has different impacts on varying soils. Brilliant Blue FCF is attracted to and sorbed in acidic soils due to its large size and ionic charge. Soil composition and flow velocity also effect the level of sorption of Brilliant Blue FCF. Brilliant Blue FCF dye within beverages items‚Äîsuch as soda‚Äîcan be used in the blue bottle experiment. In such foods, both the dye and reducing agents are incorporated in the same solution. When the solution is blue, oxygen is present. On the addition of NaOH, a reaction occurs that removes the oxygen, turning the solution clear. The dye turns back to blue once it is reoxidized by swirling the solution, incorporating oxygen from the air as an oxidizing agent. Health and safety In the United Kingdom, Smarties chocolates were colored with Brilliant Blue FCF (top) until 2008, later being replaced with a natural spirulina coloring (bottom). The dye is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 95% of the ingested dye can be found in the feces. When applied to the tongue or shaved skin, Brilliant Blue FCF can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream. Due to its nontoxic properties, Brilliant Blue FCF has been used as a biological stain. When dissolved in an acidic medium, this dye has been used to stain cell walls, bacteria, and fungal cells. The dye does not inhibit the growth of any of these species. For similar reasons, Brilliant Blue FCF is also being utilized in hemostatic medical devices, most notably the HEMOPATCH‚Äîdesigned to be placed on bleeding tissues and coagulate the blood. A low concentration of Brilliant Blue FCF is placed on the backside of the HEMOPATCH at 1 cm increments, allowing surgeons to cut precisely and indicate the side of the HEMOPATCH that is an active hemostatic agent for correct placement. Brilliant Blue FCF is an approved food colorant and pharmacologically inactive substance for drug formulations in the EU and the United States. It is also legal in other countries. It has the capacity for inducing allergic reactions in individuals with pre-existing moderate asthma. In 2003, the U.S. FDA issued a public health advisory to warn health care providers of the potential toxicity of this synthetic dye in enteral feeding solutions. The following legal limits apply in the EU (E 131) and other countries: 150‚Äì300 mg/kg depending on the type of food. Safety limit for foods and drugs: 0.1 mg/day per kg body weight. The ADI for Brilliant Blue FCF is 6 mg/kg. Biomedical research Brilliant Blue FCF and similar dyes such as Brilliant Blue G are inhibitors to purinergic receptors‚Äîreceptors that are responsible for inflammatory responses and other cell process. Scientists who were conducting in-vivo studies of compounds to lessen the severity of inflammation following experimental spinal cord injury had previously tested a compound called OxATP to block a key ATP receptor in spinal neurons. However, OxATP has toxic side effects and must be injected directly into the spinal cord; in searching for alternatives they noted that Brilliant Blue FCF has a similar structure. This led them to test a related dye, Brilliant Blue G (also known as Coomassie Brilliant Blue) in rats, which improved recovery from spinal cord injury while temporarily turning them blue. When human washed platelets are evaluated using turbidimetry it was found that Brilliant Blue FCF affects platelet aggregation by blocking the Panx1 channels. These inhibitory effects on collagen-induced shape change and maximal aggregation were shown by high (1 mM) concentrations of the dye but not by lower concentrations (100 ŒºM). The 1 mM effective concentration is 1.59 times greater than the approximately 0.63 mM maximal allowable Brilliant Blue FCF concentration according to the European Food Safety Authority. Scientists are performing studies to better understand the effects of Brilliant Blue FCF during vein graft explantation. Brilliant Blue FCF hinders the purinergic receptors, limiting cell proliferation that may lead to intimal hyperplasia. The effects of Brilliant Blue FCF were tested on rat aortic cells. It was found that Brilliant Blue FCF had a positive impact in limiting the development of intimal hyperplasia following a vein graft procedure.

Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Alyson Stoner, and Tom Welling reprise their roles as members of the 12-child Baker family. Eugene Levy co-stars as the patriarch of a rival family of eight children. Carmen Electra portrays his wife. Plot Two years after Tom Baker resigned from his head coaching position, his family begins to undergo many changes, beginning with his daughter Lorraine's internship with Allure magazine in New York City. The Bakers‚Äô oldest daughter, Nora, is now married to Bud McNulty and pregnant with their first child; Bud and Nora intend to move to Houston because of Bud's new job. Feeling the family is breaking apart as the children grow up and move away, Tom persuades them to take one last family vacation all together at Lake Winnetka, a fictional lake in Wisconsin. The family finds that their old cabin is currently owned by a man named Mike Romanow. Tom's old rival, Jimmy Murtaugh, his new wife Sarina, and their large family (with \\"only\\" eight kids) are also staying at the lake for the summer; Jimmy is also friends and neighbors with Mike Romanow. Jimmy constantly flaunts his wealth and success to Tom, as well as the accomplishments of his children, often suggesting to Tom that his are less successful because of his parenting style. They get into many incidents, several of which are accidental: Mark Baker, along with Kenny Murtaugh, crashes into a tennis court with a golf cart, Sarah Baker is caught shoplifting from a gift shop, and Mark accidentally sets off a backpack of fireworks, causing widespread panic, especially when it is thrown into a boat, igniting its engine and causing it to explode. Jimmy again brings up the topic that Tom needs to be more strict with his kids. Tom is angered by this, and he and Jimmy decide to settle the matter at the Annual Labor Day Family Cup. Tom trains the kids for days, not realizing they are miserable. Sarah and Elliot Murtaugh watch Ice Age together, but are spied on by their fathers, which ultimately results in them getting into an argument and humiliating their children. Upon returning to the Bakers‚Äô cabin, Sarah is furious and refuses to compete for Tom in the Cup. The children are angry with him, not only for spying on Sarah, but also for ruining the entire trip because of his competitiveness with the Murtaughs, and Tom's wife Kate laments that his and Jimmy‚Äôs conflicting parenting styles have torn the two families even further apart. The next morning, Tom goes to the Cup to compete with Nigel and Kyle, the only two still willing to go. However, after discovering an old \\"Team Baker\\" flag, Kate and the rest of the kids show up, showing they forgive him and are willing to compete. After the events, however, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are tied for first; a tiebreaking canoe race is announced, in which every family member must compete. During the canoe race, Nora goes into labor; the Murtaughs want to help, but Jimmy, sensing the opportunity to defeat Tom once and for all, refuses to do so. The Murtaugh children jump out of the canoe to help the Bakers. While arguing with Sarina, Jimmy reveals that he was jealous of Tom being the popular one when they were younger. Eventually, Sarina convinces him to help and the two families work together to get Nora to the hospital. Bud, Lorraine, and Kate go with Nora in the delivery room, while Tom, Jimmy, Sarina, and the rest of the kids stay in the waiting room. While talking with Jimmy, Tom realizes that he has to let his kids grow, but wherever they go, they will always be with him, and he will always be with them. Nora then gives birth to a baby boy whom she and Bud name Tom in honor of his grandfather, who has shown them that \\"there is no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one.\\" Bud announces that he and Nora have bought the cabin that the Bakers had been renting. Nora, Bud, and baby Tom leave for Houston a few days later.

It has a rating of 6% based on 93 reviews of the film. The site's consensus reads: \\"A sequel to a remake, Cheaper 2 wastes its solid cast in scenes of over-the-top, predictable humor\\". On Metacritic, it has a score of 34 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert, gave the film one of its rare positive reviews, awarding it 3/4 stars and stating \\"As I watched this sequel, a certain good feeling began to make itself known. Yes, the movie is unnecessary. However, it is unnecessary at a higher level of warmth and humor than the recent remake Yours, Mine, and Ours.\\" Ebert also highly praised Alyson Stoner's performance, favorably comparing the then-twelve year old actress to Reese Witherspoon. Calling the overall film \\"bland\\", Variety's Justin Chang agreed with Ebert on Stoner, calling her \\"an endearingly vulnerable standout\\" and deeming her subplot to be \\"the most engaging\\" in it. Chang was also kind to Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt and Eugene Levy, deeming the veteran actors did the best with what was given to them. Marrit Ingman of the Austin Chronicle conceded that it had a good message, and agreed that Hunt was \\"marvelous and down-to-earth\\" but ultimately felt that \\"the rest of the movie is as funny as mildew\\", found that \\"the product placement is particularly egregious\\" and thought that Hilary Duff looked \\"as tanned and raw as buffalo jerky\\". Andrea Gronvall was also horrified by Duff's appearance while writing for the Chicago Reader, calling her \\"haggard\\" and \\"flat-out scary\\", and overall felt that there was \\"a discernible lack of enthusiasm from almost everyone involved\\", however singling out Carmen Electra for being \\"the most winning performer of the bunch\\". The film received two Razzie Award nominations including Worst Actress (Hilary Duff) and Worst Supporting Actor (Eugene Levy). =Box office= The film grossed $9,309,387 on its opening weekend, finishing in 4th place at the box office. By the end of its run, Cheaper by the Dozen 2 grossed $82,571,173 domestically and $46,610,657 internationally, totaling $129,181,830 worldwide. It is one of only twelve feature films to be released in over 3,000 theaters and still improve on its box office performance in its second weekend, increasing 55.6% from $9,309,387 to $14,486,519.

She was named for Captain Arthur Sinclair. History Sinclair was laid down on 15 October 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; launched on 2 June 1919; sponsored by Mrs. George Barnett, great-granddaughter of Capt. Sinclair; and commissioned on 8 October 1919, Lt. Cmdr. C. S. Roberts in command. After shakedown, Sinclair departed Newport, Rhode Island on 17 January 1920 for the Caribbean. Between 7 and 25 February 1920, she patrolled off the coasts of Honduras and Guatemala during political unrest in those countries. From 13 to 18 March, she assisted in efforts to salvage the submarine, H-l, aground off Santa Margarita Island, California. She then joined the Pacific Fleet for operations off San Diego, California. On 9 July 1920, Sinclair embarked the Secretary of the Navy and Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, at Seattle, Washington, and carried them on a tour of ports in Alaska and British Columbia. The Secretary of the Navy transferred to on 18 July, and the Commander in Chief to upon returning to Puget Sound on 12 August. Sinclair then resumed operations off San Diego until decommissioned and placed in reserve there on 25 May 1920. On 27 September 1923, Sinclair was recommissioned as a replacement for one of the seven destroyers wrecked on Point Honda on 8 September 1923. After shakedown at San Diego, she sailed south with the Battle Fleet in January 1924, transited the Panama Canal on the 17th, and participated in exercises during the fleet concentration in the Caribbean from 25 January to 5 April. After returning to San Diego on 22 April, she underwent overhaul at Puget Sound from 3 May to 13 June and, after a brief visit to San Diego, rejoined the fleet in the Puget Sound area for a summer exercise. She operated at San Diego from 1 October 1924 to 3 April 1925, was overhauled at Puget Sound from 12 April to 19 June, and rejoined the fleet at Pearl Harbor on 27 June. On 1 July 1925, Sinclair sailed from Hawaii with the Battle Fleet on a goodwill visit to the Southwest Pacific, and visited Melbourne, Australia; Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand; and American Samoa before returning to San Diego on 26 September. She departed San Diego on 1 February 1926 for fleet exercises off the Canal Zone, returning on 6 March. From 15 March to 30 April, she received repairs at Bremerton; and, on 21 June, departed San Diego with the Battle Fleet for summer exercises off Puget Sound, which lasted until 1 September. Again departing San Diego with the Battle Fleet on 17 February 1927, Sinclair transited the Panama Canal on 4 March and participated in exercises in the Caribbean until 13 April. On 24 April, she returned to San Diego and then proceeded to Bremerton, Washington for repairs which lasted from 4 May to 28 June 1927. She spent the summer training reserves in the Puget Sound area and returned to San Diego on 9 September. Sinclair underwent overhaul at Puget Sound from 26 March to 9 May 1928 and rejoined the fleet at Pearl Harbor on 16 May for exercises. Returning to San Diego on 23 June, she sailed on 5 July for summer exercises in the north, lasting to 18 August. From 1 September 1928 to 15 January 1929, she operated off San Diego; and, from 27 January to 21 February, she participated in Fleet Problem IX off Panama. She commenced overhaul at Puget Sound on 17 March 1929 but was ordered decommissioned instead. After returning to San Diego on 8 April 1929, she was decommissioned there on 1 June 1929. Fate On 22 November 1930, Sinclair was renamed Light Target (IX-37). Due to faulty boilers, however, her conversion to a target ship was cancelled, and she was replaced by . She recovered her original name on 24 April 1931 and her destroyer designation on 11 August 1931. Sinclair was struck from the Navy list on 5 June 1935 and sold on 30 August 1935 to Learner and Rosenthal, Oakland, California, for scrapping. As of 2005, no other ship have been named Sinclair.

The stadium was built in 1997. It is the home for the Rookie-league GCL Braves. The 7,500-seat stadium was designed by David M. Schwarz in a style designer dubbed Florida Picturesque incorporating Venetian Gothic Revival, Mediterranean and Spanish influences with yellow-painted stucco, green-tile roofs, towers and arches. Name Champion Stadium was originally known as The Ballpark then Cracker Jack Stadium. When it was first built, Frito-Lay purchased the naming rights to the venue for ten years and put its Cracker Jack brand on the stadium. Frito-Lay chose not to renew its naming rights deal. During most of 2007, it was referred to as The Ballpark at Disney's Wide World of Sports. On November 1 of that year, HanesBrands Inc. purchased the naming rights for ten years and put its Champion brand on the stadium. History Originally, Disney planned for no MLB permanent spring training tenant for the stadium, instead using as a Grapefruit League neutral site with rotating teams. However, the Braves organization became interested and moved in. The Atlanta Braves Spring Training game against the New York Mets in 2008 The Ballpark opened with the rest of Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex on March 28, 1997 with an exhibition baseball game between the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds. The Gulf Coast League Braves began play at the stadium in 1997, while the Atlanta Braves started its 20-year spring training lease in 1998. Opening ceremony of the 2016 Invictus Games In 2000, after years of poor attendance at Tinker Field, the Orlando Rays moved to the Ballpark. However, the Rays, continued to draw barely 1,000 fans a game in their new stadium. Things improved somewhat over the next three seasons; the Rays drew 150,051 fans in 2003, more than twice what they had seen just a few years earlier at Tinker Field, but still last in the league. Following the 2003 season, the Rays moved (breaking a 10-year lease at Disney after just four years) and became the Montgomery Biscuits. The venue hosted the 2001 Atlantic 10 Conference Baseball Tournament, won by Temple. The old style manual score board was replaced in 2003 with a larger electronic scoreboard and message center. Champion Stadium was used during first-round games for the 2006 World Baseball Classic. It hosted Pool D, and featured teams with professional players from Venezuela, Australia, Dominican Republic and Italy. The stadium hosted its first regular season MLB games from May 15‚Äì17, 2007 season when the Texas Rangers played the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in a three-game series. The three games drew a total of 26,917 fans, and attendance went up each game. In April 2008, the Rays moved another series, this time against the Toronto Blue Jays, to Orlando. In January 2017, the Braves announced a formal agreement to move their spring training home to North Port in 2019.

Since 2010, it has been the spring training home of the Baltimore Orioles. History Ed Smith Stadium was built in 1989 to replace Payne Park as a Spring Training and Minor League Baseball site. It is named for the Sarasota civic leader who was instrumental in getting the new stadium built. It was formerly the spring home of the Chicago White Sox (1989‚Äì1997) and the Baltimore Orioles (1991). In 1998, it replaced Plant City Stadium as the spring training home of the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds remained at the facility through 2008. After Cincinnati's club moved its spring activities to Arizona, Ed Smith Stadium spent a year without major league Spring Training. The Orioles became the stadium's tenant and operator in 2010. Baltimore had trained in Sarasota before‚Äîat Twin Lakes Park in 1989 and 1990, as well as at Ed Smith in 1991‚Äîbefore moving to St. Petersburg and then Ft. Lauderdale for spring games. From 1989 to 2009, the stadium hosted a series of Minor League Baseball teams, the Single-A Sarasota White Sox, Sarasota Red Sox, and Sarasota Reds. From 2004 until 2009, it housed the Gulf Coast League's Gulf Coast Reds. Ed Smith has also hosted high school and college baseball tournaments. On November 1, 2008, Barack Obama gave a speech to a crowd of 10,000 spectators as part of his 2008 presidential campaign. Renovation Ed Smith Stadium after $31 million renovation In 2008, a planned renovation fell through when a proposed bond issue from the city of Sarasota to partially fund the renovation was rejected by the voters. The Reds, whose lease with the city and the stadium expired after the season, announced that they intend to seek a new spring training home. They moved to Goodyear Ballpark, located in Arizona, in 2010. The Baltimore Orioles reached a tentative 30-year agreement to begin spring training at Ed Smith Stadium starting in 2010 which included renovations to the stadium and surrounding areas. The $31.2 million renovation was completed prior to the beginning of spring training in February 2011. Features after renovation Seats in the renovated stadium are refurbished seats from the Orioles' revolutionary home ballpark, Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Three air- conditioned suites added to the park are numbered Suites 66, 70, and 83, corresponding to the club's three World Series championships. A fabric sun shade system extends from the stadium's original roof to nearly double the number of seats in the shade.http://mlb.mlb.com/bal/downloads/y2011/ess_fact_sheet.pdf A series of photos produced by the Orioles shows the dramatic changes resulting from the renovation.http://mlb.mlb.com/bal/downloads/y2011/ess_enovations.pdf Seating is available for 7,428 spectators, with standing room space taking the park's total capacity to 8,500. Two concourses include food and beverage stands, a cafe, and a gift shop. 100 HDTVs are located throughout the stadium and a HD LED video board in the outfield measures high by across.

In both venues, the teams share the main stadium where the games are played. However, the teams have their own practice fields, outdoor batting cages, several pitching mounds, and state-of-the-art conditioning rooms. History Through 2002 the Montreal Expos shared the stadium with the Cardinals, until they swapped with the Marlins as part of the Marlins sale to Jeffrey Loria. The Expos, now known as the Washington Nationals, then moved to Space Coast Stadium in Viera. Roger Dean Stadium was badly damaged in 2004 by hurricanes Frances and Jeanne.

Gillis and Mike Saenz, and published by First Comics. A dystopian science fiction fantasy somewhat in the mold of Blade Runner, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale (Total Recall), and other cyberpunk stories. Shatter was written by Gillis and illustrated directly on the computer by Saenz. Shatter was the first commercially published all-digital comic where all art for publication was entered by hand on the computer as opposed to later methods of scanning in inked pages for color application. Until the late 1970s to early 1980s computer generated comics were done with traditional text and line-printing techniques or semigraphics, ascii art, and BBC's ceefax teletext. Production Shatter was drawn on an original Macintosh Plus in MacPaint and later using FullPaint by Ann Arbor Softworks. Page data was stored on an external 800K floppy disk drive. The drawings were difficult to manage due to the limited 9\\" 72ppi monochrome screen (512√ó342 pixels) as only roughly 2/3 of the page was able to be worked on at one time. Approximately half of the issues were drawn using the standard Macintosh mouse until graphics tablet pen type digitizers became available. Artwork was printed on an Apple dot-matrix ImageWriter until 1985 when Apple donated a Laserwriter enabling Adobe PostScript font styles for typesetting text, and made illustration graphics smoother and less pixelated. Once printed the art was then colored by Saenz, and then photographed for mass printing using traditional comic publication techniques for page layouts and color separation. Following Saenz' departure after issue #3, issues 4-7 diverged to traditional art on board artwork which was scanned into the computer. Once Charlie Athanas was hired for issues 8 until the series end the artwork returned to a nearly all digital workflow. The only exception were that rough pencil drafts started the process which allowed editors to approve layouts and writers to begin creating the stories. Artwork was still directly drawn into the computer. The new method allowed for faster publication times for the remainder of the series. Publication history Shatter first appeared in the March 1985 issue (#12) of computer magazine Big K (IPC Media, London with Tony Tyler as editor) and was described as \\"the world's first comics series entirely drawn on a computer.\\" During this same period, Shatter appeared simultaneously as a one-shot special and as a backup feature in First Comics‚Äô Jon Sable title in 1985.Because of comic book cover-dating practices of this time, most comics were cover-dated two-to-three months in advance of their actual publication date. Therefore, the March 1985 Big K publication and the June 1985 First Comics publications were roughly concurrent. Shatter was then published as its own 14-issue series from 1985-1988. The book was art- directed by Alex Wald. Collections have been published by First Comics and AiT/Planet Lar. =Timeline= * March 1985: the first episode of Shatter, written by Gillis and illustrated by Saenz, is featured in the British computer magazine Big K, published by IPC Magazines (now IPC Media). It consists of a black and white version of the first four pages of the John Sable: Freelance backup feature. While the last page promises \\"Continued next month in BIG K\\", it was the final issue of the magazine. * June 1985: Shatter Special No.1, published by First Comics is released; editor Mike Gold expects the series to run as a backup feature in Jon Sable: Freelance for 6-12 months. * June‚ÄìNovember 1985: Shatter runs as an 8 page backup feature in Jon Sable: Freelance issues #25-30. * December 1985: Shatter releases issue #1 that sells out all 60,000 printed copies. (First Comics does not do multiple printings). * May 1986: Artist Mike Saenz leaves after three issues. He creates ComicWorks for software company Macromind as the first personal digital publishing software system for comic creation. After combining with Paracomp in 1991, MacroMind-Paracomp merges with Authorware, Inc to form Macromedia in 1992, which was acquired in 2005 by Adobe Systems. * June‚ÄìDecember 1986: With the departure of Saenz, artwork reverts back to traditional art on board which is first drawn, inked then scanned into the computer for manipulation for issues 4-8 using existing artists, Steve Erwin and Bob Dienethal. Due to primitive scanning technology, artwork was generally less defined and resulted in a less clean look from the original issues. * December 1986: Bruce Sterling coins the term \\"cyberpunk\\" in the preface to the short story anthology Mirrorshades (1986) featuring William Gibson, Tom Maddox, Pat Cadigan, Rudy Rucker, Marc Laidlaw, James Patrick Kelly, Greg Bear, Lewis Shiner, John Shirley and Paul Di Filippo. * April 1987: Charlie Athanas is brought on for issues 9-14. Athanas re-establishes drawing directly on the Macintosh Plus with the computer mouse. In an effort to increase publication efficiency, rough pencil sketches were draftewd in order to breakdown layouts, expedite script writing, and get editor approval. Once approved, Athanas manually re-drew the rough sketches directly into the computer without the use of scanners. Eliminating scanned artwork resulted in cleaner art style. Dialog was able to be added as soon as writers had it available using the lettering from the Laserwriter's PostScript libraries which contributed to the overall style of the comic. * April 1988: Shatter completes its 14 issue run. * April 12, 1988 Shatter is released as a trade paperback by Ballantine Books. * July 25th 2006 The Shatter collection is re-printed by AIT/Planet Lar.

Route description concurrent with Interstate 44 Business at their eastern terminus near Duenweg Route 66 begins at the Kansas state line in Jasper County, where it continues west into that state as K-66. From the state line, the route heads northeast on West 7th Street, a four-lane divided highway also marked as \\"Historic Route 66\\". The road intersects Old Route 66, at which point it curves to the east. Route 66 passes through wooded areas with some development, passing through Central City. Farther east, the median becomes a center left-turn lane as the highway passes businesses. The route crosses into Joplin and intersects the southern terminus of Route P. Route 66 continues as a four-lane undivided road through commercial areas, running to the north of a Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad line for a time. The road passes a mix of homes and businesses before it heads into downtown Joplin and intersects I-44 Bus./Route 43. At this point, I-44 Bus. turns east to form a concurrency with Route 66. The two routes continue east on East 7th Street, passing through more of the downtown before coming to a bridge over the Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad and Kansas City Southern's Heavener Subdivision.

It is located in Lashkargah District, where the Arghandab River merges into the Helmand River. The city has a population of 201,546 as of 2006. Lashkargah is linked by major roads with Kandahar to the east, Zaranj on the border with Iran to the west, and Farah and Herat to the north-west. It is mostly very arid and desolate. However, farming does exist around the Helmand and Arghandab rivers. Bost Airport is located on the east bank of the Helmand River, five miles north of the junction of the Helmand and Argahandab rivers.  History  Lashkargah means \\"army barracks\\" in Persian language. The area was part of the Saffarids in the 9th century. It grew up a thousand years ago as a riverside barracks town for soldiers accompanying the Ghaznavid nobility to their grand winter capital of Bost. The ruins of the Ghaznavid mansions still stand along the Helmand River; the city of Bost and its outlying communities were sacked in successive centuries by the Ghorids, Mongols, and Timurids. However, the region was later rebuilt by Timur/Tamerlane (Timur Lang). By the late 16th century the city and region was governed by the Safavid dynasty. It became part of the Afghan Hotaki Empire in 1709. It was invaded by the Afsharid forces in 1738 on their way to Kandahar. By 1747 it became part of the Durrani Empire or modern Afghanistan. The British arrived in or about 1840 during the First Anglo-Afghan War but left about year later. The city was used by Ayub Khan in the Second Anglo-Afghan War until 1880 when the British helped return it to Abdur Rahman Khan. It remained peaceful for the next 100 years. American designed street of Lashkargah. The modern city of Lashkargah was used as a headquarters for United States Army Corps of Engineers working on the Helmand Valley Authority (HVA) irrigation project in the 1950s, modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the United States. Lashkargah was built using American designs, with broad tree-lined streets and brick houses with no walls separating them from the street. In the wake of the Soviet invasion and the long Afghan civil war, the trees mostly came down and walls went up. The massive Helmand irrigation project in the 1940s‚Äì1970s created one of the most extensive farming zones in southern Afghanistan, opening up many thousands of hectares of desert to human cultivation and habitation. The project focused on three large canals: the Boghra, Shamalan, and Darweshan. Responsibility for maintaining the canals was given to the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority (HAVA), a semi-independent government agency whose authority (in its heyday) rivaled that of the provincial governors. After the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989 and the collapse of Mohammad Najibullah's government in 1992, the city was taken over by the Mujaheddin forces. In the mid-1990s it fell to the Taliban government. In late 2001, the Taliban were removed from power by the United States armed forces. Since 2002, the city and region was occupied by United States Marine Corps and the International Security Assistance Force. In 2008, Taliban forces attacked the city heavily but the Afghan National Army and the Oregon Army National Guard managed to hold them back, as shown in the documentary, \\"Shepherds of Helmand.\\" After training and equipping Afghan security forces, the foreign armies transferred security responsibility to the military of Afghanistan and Afghan National Police in 2011. The city has witnessed some fighting in the form of attacks orchestrated by the Taliban insurgents. Climate Lashkargah has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen BWh), characterised by little precipitation and high variation between summer and winter temperatures. The average temperature in Lashkargah is 20.1 ¬∞C, while the annual precipitation averages 97 mm. Summers start in mid-May, last until late-September, and are extremely dry. July is the hottest month of the year with an average temperature of 32.8 ¬∞C. The coldest month January has an average temperature of 7.6 ¬∞C. Helmand River Boat riding on the Helmand River. The riverside thickets are located on the other side. The Helmand River is the longest in Afghanistan with a length of 1,150 km. The river originates in the Hindu Kush and ends in Hamun-i-Helmand in the Sistan and Baluchistan province of neighboring Iran. One of the two primary arms of the river crosses through Lashkargah, giving it the attractive air of a riverside city. It makes for a pleasant setting for the citizens of Lashkargah to picnic. The river is deep enough at Lashkargah to allow for varied water sports, including swimming and boating. Boats are available for rent to the public. Mirwais Neka Park was recently built on the banks of the river. There is a large thicket located on the opposite side of the river from the city. Many types of trees and different species of birds, mammals, and reptiles inhabit the thicket. Cultural and other places The Lashkargah Mosque is the main mosque in the city. The great fortress of Bost, Qala-e- Bost,Picture of Qala-e-Bost Castle http://maiaibing.smugmug.com/Afghanistan/Helmand-Landscape-Pictures/i-vP7ch3k remains an impressive ruin. It is located at 31¬∞ 30‚Äô 02‚Ä≥ N, 64¬∞ 21‚Äô 24‚Ä≥ E near the convergence of the Helmand and Arghandab Rivers, a half-hour's drive south of Lashkargah. Qala-e-Bost is famous for its decorative arch, which appears on the 100 Afghani note (Afghan currency). As of April 2008, it was possible to descend into an ancient shaft about 20 feet across and 200 feet deep, with a series of dark side rooms and a spiral staircase leading to the bottom. In 2006 construction began on a cobblestone road to lead from the south of Lashkargah to the Qala-e-Bost Arch (known to readers of James A.

In 2015 it has been estimated at about 276,831. Land Use Lashkargah is a Trading and Transit Hub in southern Afghanistan. As it is located at the confluence of the Helmand and Arghandab rivers, it is blessed with the most hectares of water (4,940 Ha) of any provincial capital in the country. Agriculture consequently accounts for the largest amount of land use (61%). Dwellings are clustered in the central districts. Education and media Helmand Institute of Teachers Training The level of education in Lashkargah had been very high during the 1960s and 70s before the Soviet Invasion and Civil War. The students were talented, active, and hard workers. They were always taking up good positions within the universities. There are around 27 schools, a teacher's training institute, an agricultural school, Lashkargah Technical, Agricultural and Veterinarian Institute 800 M past the Bolan Bridge founded in 2011, with Abdul Malek as dean. Lashkargah has a number of Higher educational institutions the Public Helmand University founded in 2008, with Soor Gul Sandakheel as Chancellor with a campus close to the Peace Square and a new Campus to be built close to Lashkargah with a construction budget of 1.5 million US$. Helmand University has four faculties, Agriculture, engineering, education and veterinarian. The Bost Institute of higher education in Helmand Province is a private, non- sectarian institution of higher education founded in 1391‚Äì2012 in Lashkargah with courses in law, engineering and business administration. The Bost Agricultural university was registered with the Ministry of Higher Education in 2007, and was inaugurated by former governor of Helmand Province, Assadullah Wafa. Bost Agricultural University currently only provides education in the field of Agriculture. There are also many computer and English language courses in the city, and thousands of students are attending them. Besides the activities of the Department of Culture and Information of Helmand Province, the youth are also actively involved in different cultural and educational activities. There are different cultural groups operating in Lashkargah, including: the Helmand Youth Organization, the Bost Cultural Society, the Allama Mahmud Tarzi Educational and Cultural Association, and the Helmand Cultural Group.

Recent developments Peace Square The city of Lashkargah has undergone large scale development in the past few years with new roads, markets and residential areas constructed. Many Afghans continue to leave their tribes and emigrate towards cities ‚Äì such as Lashkargah. Government projects distributed land to the people, increasing the approximate size of the city. Modern architecture and building methods are more common, now, here than Mud squats and other more traditional Afghan architecture. The current Governor of Helmand province, Gulab Mangal, has funded large scale development of the city, the Governor's office and Justice Department have been recently renovated, new Police Headquarters and Eidgah have also been funded. Unlike much of Afghanistan the roads in Lashkargah are generally paved with asphalt. International Organizations and PRT in Lashkargah have helped to complete rehabilitation and infrastructure projects such as building: schools, roads and parks. In 2005 it was announced that a USAID-funded project would build six reservoirs in Lashkargah, with responsibility for the water supply then being handed over to the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority. The city had been without fresh water for the previous 30 years due to the contamination of the Helmand River.USAID Field Report Afghanistan Feb 2005 ReliefWeb As part of Operation Moshtarak in 2010, the British Army and local workforces constructed Route Trident, a road to connect Lashkargah and the northern, more developed city of Gereshk, Governor Mangal's efforts to restructure the city have left Route Trident underfunded, but highly ranked in the priority of rebuilding Lashkargah. A current project in the city, to aid regeneration is the \\"Lashkargah Bost Airport and Agriculture Center\\". This project will consist of constructing a new agricultural center, an Industrial Park and will repair, upgrade and modernise Bost Airport through renovation projects. Sports Lashkargah Football Stadium Football and cricket are the most popular sports in the area. The Lashkargah Football Stadium was rebuilt in 2006 and has a capacity of more around 10,000 spectators. Currently, 13 registered cricket teams are playing at the new Karzai Stadium in Lashkargah, which was completed in the summer of 2009. Bodybuilding has also attracted the youth of Lashkargah. There are several gymnasiums in the city. Aziz Ahmad Nikyar gained the title of Mr. Afghanistan in 2006, and also participated in the 2006 Asian Games representing AfghanistanOther popular sports in Lashkargah are Taekwondo, Boxing, Snooker, Volleyball.

In addition to the Dodgers' spring games, it was the home of the Vero Beach Devil Rays, previously the Vero Beach Dodgers, of the Florida State League, through the 2008 season. The official seating capacity is 6,500. History The then-Brooklyn Dodgers were one of the first major league baseball teams to conduct spring training in Florida, establishing their operations in this quiet beachside town in 1948. Previously an abandoned Naval base, the complex was transformed for the Dodgers. Historic Dodgertown and Holman Stadium served as their spring home for more than 60 years. In recent decades, Arizona has established itself alongside Florida as the second major center for spring baseball, and the Dodgers were the last Western team in Major League Baseball to still conduct their spring training in Florida, having retained their spring training home even after the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958.http://www.vbsportsvillage.com/Vero+Beach+Sports+Village+History/ In 2001, the Dodgers seriously considered moving their spring training operations to Arizona, but the city of Vero Beach persuaded them to stay by purchasing the Historic Dodgertown complex from the team and leasing it back for a nominal $1 per year. In 2006, the Dodgers again received offers from several Arizona cities, attempting to persuade them to move. Ultimately, the offers were too lucrative to overcome the burden of having to reimburse Vero Beach for purchasing the complex. With the Camelback Ranch opening in Glendale in 2009, the Dodgers joined the Chicago White Sox to share the new facility. The Dodgers' last spring training game in Vero Beach was on March 17, 2008. Holman is unique for its open-air dugouts that are literally dug out along the sides of the field. These may have been the inspiration for the dugouts in Johnny Hart's B.C. comic strip. \\"This place is so different from any other park\\", states George Betscha, a batboy at Dodgertown from 2005‚Äì2008. \\"There is so much history here and you can feel it when you walk around.\\" In addition to baseball, the Holman Stadium complex and conference center has hosted training sessions by the New Orleans Saints, the Green Bay Packers, the Cleveland Browns, the Buffalo Bills, the New England Patriots, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Philadelphia Eagles, and the college teams of the Miami Hurricanes, the Ohio State Buckeyes and the University of South Florida Bulls. Holman Stadium has also played host to some international teams such as the Yomiuri Giants, the Chunichi Dragons, the Osaka Buffaloes (Japan), the Samsung Lions, the LG Twins,, the SK Wyverns, , the Sinon Bulls Taiwanese team, the Nigeria national baseball team, and the Moscow Red Devils. Outside of sports, on March 31, 1961 at 7:30 p.m., famed evangelist Dr. Billy Graham held a Good Friday service at Holman Stadium during his Florida Crusades. The Baltimore Orioles were recruited to move up to Vero Beach in 2010, from their spring home in Fort Lauderdale, but after failing to reach an agreement, the City of Vero Beach rescinded its offer. The city is exploring other options outside of Major League Baseball spring training. Reports surfaced in 2009 that the Major League Baseball Players Association was considering Holman Stadium as an alternate training site for players who entered the spring as unsigned free agents. However, the MLBPA decided not to go forward with the plan. As of 2017, nearby Dodgertown Elementary School has not changed its name. The United Football League expressed an early interest in using the Historic Dodgertown facility as a training and practice grounds, but no agreement to do so was ever reached. During the final (2012) season, each team utilized a training site in or near its home market. Dodgertown became the Vero Beach Sports Village in 2010. It is now used for sports tournaments including baseball and football tournaments, concerts and other special events. In 2013, former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley and current Dodger ownership, headed by President Stan Kasten, reached agreement to re-brand Vero Beach Sports Village under the name Historic Dodgertown. Historic Dodgertown now holds year round youth sports tournaments in baseball, soccer, lacrosse, and Minor League Baseball's Umpire Training Academy.

It was constructed in 1937, as a multi-purpose stadium, by the City of Nashua. The official seating capacity is 2,800 people. Holman is the home of the Nashua Silver Knights of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League. History The city-owned stadium is named for Charles Frank Holman, who contributed $55,000 for the project. Holman Stadium, which also was funded by the federal Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression, was dedicated to the youth and people of Nashua in memory of Holman's parents. Philip S. Avery, a Nashua native, was the architect. The original Holman Stadium was a plain seating bowl in which fans sat on bleachers and concrete steps. It was used for baseball and football. The stadium has hosted concerts by famous artists including Aerosmith, The Beach Boys, Bon Jovi, David Cassidy, Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan, The J. Geils Band, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Carlos Santana, Phish, and Warren Zevon. In 1996, the stadium was a site for celebrations along the Olympic Torch Relay route. =Affiliated baseball= The stadium was home to several minor-league affiliates of Major League Baseball organizations, beginning with the Nashua Dodgers, affiliated with the Brooklyn Dodgers and managed by Walter Alston. Holman hosted the first integrated U.S. baseball team in the modern era when Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe played for the Nashua Dodgers in 1946. After the Dodgers' four-year run, baseball did not return to Holman Stadium until 1983, at the double-A level: an affiliate of the California Angels for one year, then the Pittsburgh Pirates. While home to the Nashua Pirates in 1985, Holman Stadium hosted the Eastern League All- Star Game. =Independent baseball= The Nashua Hawks of the North Atlantic League played at Holman Stadium in 1995, ending in 1996 with a mid-season eviction for nonpayment of rent. In 1998, Holman Stadium became home to the Nashua Pride of the Atlantic League. The Pride acquired turquoise-colored stadium seating from Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. The Pride's pre-emption of dates from high-school football became a focus of neighborhood opposition, but eventually the city built Stellos Stadium for football. Between the 2001 and 2002 seasons, the stadium was upgraded generally: The open-air desks in the brick press box were raised, enclosed and modernized; a new level of luxury boxes was built above it, the concourse outside the seating bowl was upgraded with a ticket office and gift shop, and the business offices were upgraded. In 2003, Holman Stadium hosted the Atlantic League All- Star Game. In 2006, the Pride switched to the Can-Am League with its shorter season. In 2008, the team was sold to an ownership group including former Boston Red Sox General Manager Dan Duquette and renamed the American Defenders of New Hampshire. The Defenders played a single season in 2009, concluded on the road because of non-payments to the city; in 2010, the team moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts to become the Pittsfield Colonials. =Collegiate baseball= In 2011, the Nashua Silver Knights brought baseball back to Holman Stadium. In 2012, Holman Stadium hosted the inaugural FCBL All-Star Game. The former football bleachers, down the left-field line, were removed, reducing the stadium's capacity to the current 2,800; the football press box remains but is now used as a storage shed. In 2017, the city installed a new sound system and a small videoboard beyond left field, costing $173,000, of which $56,000 was paid for by the Silver Knights. The videoboard supersedes a two- line alphanumeric message board that had not worked for the preceding four years and could not be repaired. In the springtime, the stadium serves as the home field for two of Nashua's schools, the Raiders of Rivier University and the Cardinals of Bishop Guertin High School. Competitors Baseball clubs at Holman Stadium compete for fans' attention with the New Hampshire Fisher Cats in Manchester (double-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays); and with the Lowell Spinners (single-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox), which owned and operated the Nashua Silver Knights until 2016.

The ballpark was built in 1996 and holds 11,026 people with an addition in right field built in 2007. This ballpark is the largest spring training ballpark in Florida. George M. Steinbrenner Field serves as the home of the Tampa Tarpons, the New York Yankees' affiliate in the Class A Advanced Florida State League, and is the Yankees' spring training home. Background and stadium history Tampa was the first spring training site in Florida, beginning in 1913 with the Chicago Cubs. In the ensuing decades, the city hosted several different Major League Baseball teams for spring training and was home to several different minor league squads during the summer, first at Plant Field near downtown and later at Al Lopez Field near West Tampa. This era came to an end in 1988 when, after almost 30 years in Tampa, the Cincinnati Reds moved to new training facilities in Plant City and transferred operation of the Tampa Tarpons, their local minor league affiliate in the Florida State League, to the Chicago White Sox. In 1989, the Tarpons moved to Sarasota and Al Lopez Field was razed, leaving the city with no professional baseball teams and no large baseball venue. In 1993, the Tampa Sports Authority announced a deal to build a new spring training stadium for the New York Yankees, who had been conducting spring training in Fort Lauderdale. The original plan was to build the facility on the former site of Al Lopez Field, just south of old Tampa Stadium. However, due to objections from the Buccaneers, the new ballpark was instead built about a half-mile to the northwest, directly across Dale Mabry Highway from Tampa Stadium, displacing a Hillsborough County correctional facility. The ballpark and the surrounding training complex cost approximately $30 million to build and was financed entirely with public funds, mostly from Hillsborough County. It hosted its first spring training game on March 1, 1996 when the Yankees opened spring training by hosting the Cleveland Indians. Stadium exterior.

The ballpark was known as Legends Field for the first dozen years of its existence. It was renamed in honor of George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner and Tampa resident, on March 27, 2008, when Steinbrenner was in failing health. He died in July 2010, and a life-size bronze statue of the late owner was placed in front of the stadium in January 2011. On April 20, 2016, Hillsborough County commissioners approved a $40 million renovation of George M. Steinbrenner Field, greenlighting an agreement that will keep New York Yankees' spring training in Tampa through 2046. Renovations began after the 2016 season. Improvements included new seats throughout the 10,000-capacity ballpark, roof replacements, a better entry plaza and an upgraded outfield concourse. The renovations also included adding new amenities such as new loge boxes, cabanas, suite upgrades, a right-field beachside bar and bullpen clubs. The bullpen clubs will be installed on both the first base and the third base side. The clubs are composed of two levels; the top tier is exclusively for group tickets, club seat members and loge seating, while the bottom tier features a full bar that all ticket members can access. Additional shaded areas were constructed to protect fans from the sun. The team's spring training practice facility on Himes Avenue was also upgraded. The renovations were completed in time for Spring Training 2017.George M.

UCSB brought football back as a non-scholarship sport in 1983 and by 1987 was playing a full Division II and III schedule. In 1992, the NCAA ruled that Division I colleges must play at the Division I level in all sports; UCSB and a few other universities attempted to form a non-scholarship Division I-AAA level, but the effort failed and UCSB eventually dropped football. The stadium has a capacity of 17,000 people, and currently is the largest stadium on California's Central Coast. Along with the UCSB Events Center, it is one of the more well-attended athletic venues in the Central Coast. Harder Stadium hosted a memorial service for the victims of the 2014 Isla Vista Killings. Guests in attendance included UC President Janet Napolitano, and over 20,000 students, staff, alumni, and community members. The stadium seats were filled over capacity as thousands more sat on the grass field. Soccer legacy Harder Stadium in September 2006 looking northwest towards the Santa Ynez Mountains in Santa Barbara, California Harder Stadium sees most of its present-day use as a soccer stadium to the UCSB men's soccer and women's soccer teams. The stadium hosted the final three matches of the 2010 College Cup. However, a number of professional club and international teams have played in Harder Stadium as well. =UC Santa Barbara teams= Due to the success of the men's program, the stadium has hosted numerous NCAA soccer playoff games in addition to the regular season games. Despite the men's program recent success, it was the women's program who first brought the NCAA Tournaments to Harder Stadium. The women hosted the first soccer NCAA Tournament game in a 1985 4-3 victory against Cal State Hayward. In total, the women's program has held 4 NCAA Tournament matches at Harder Stadium, bringing such opponents as the Wisconsin Badgers, Stanford Cardinal, and Hartford Hawks. The men's program hosted their first men's NCAA Tournament game in 2002, blanking the San Diego Toreros 2-0. In total, they have hosted 9 NCAA Tournament games. In 2004, 11,214 fans saw UCSB defeat VCU 4-1 to reach the College Cup (NCAA Soccer's \\"Final Four\\"). After the game, a group of students celebrated by carrying one of the soccer goals out of the stadium. They had planned to throw it into the Pacific Ocean (about 1/3 mile away), but were stopped by a combination of law enforcement down the block and tiring out from the weight of the goal. However, in 2006, the UCSB won the 2006 Division I Men's College Cup in St. Louis, Missouri. Meanwhile, 2,000 miles away at Harder Stadium, a group of rowdy students marched down to the stadium from their homes and attempted the same feat. This time the group succeeded in their quest, throwing the soccer goal off of a cliff at the beginning of the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive. In 2009, the NCAA awarded UCSB and Harder Stadium the 2010 Division I Men's College Cup, which is the \\"Final Four\\" of Division I men's soccer. On September 24, 2010, the UCSB gaucho fans set a record on the highest attendance at any NCAA (on campus) soccer match. UCSB beat the visiting UCLA team (2-0) in front of 15,896 who attended the game. Additional UCSB teams that use the stadium for select contests are the UCSB women's lacrosse, men's lacrosse and rugby teams. These teams are part of the UCSB Recreation Department and open to all students. =Other teams= Due to the large capacity of Harder Stadium, it is often used by professional teams exhibition games. In 1991, the US Women's National Team played there before the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Likewise, the US Men's National Team played there in 1994 against the Romanian National Team. Club teams also have played at Harder Stadium. In March 2004, the San Jose Earthquakes and Los Angeles Galaxy played a pre-season exhibition in Santa Barbara. Following the success of MLS teams at Harder, in March 2006 & 2007, the UC Santa Barbara men's team played exhibition matches against the Columbus Crew while in July 2006, Cruz Azul and Los Angeles Galaxy played. March 2007 also saw Shizuoka Sangy≈ç University of Japan played off against UCSB. March 2009 saw Club Am√©rica and Monarcas Morelia played, while UCSB has scheduled to play the Mexican U-17 National Team. Non-sporting activities Every year, the school's Associated Students Program Board have thrown a free day-long party, known as EXTRAVAGANZA, at Harder Stadium. Previous bands to have played at the festival include Sublime, No Doubt, Jack Johnson, T.I., Run-D.M.C., Coolio, Busta Rhymes, The Black Eyed Peas, Jane's Addiction, MxPx, Social Distortion, Eve 6, Pepper, Slightly Stoopid, Ludacris, Nas, Hellogoodbye, and E-40. Harder Stadium also houses 18 art studios located beneath the seating risers. They are primarily used by graduate students and faculty.

He is a former member of the Minnesota Senate from Fort Ripley. A Republican, he represented District 12, which includes all or portions of Crow Wing and Morrison counties, including the city of Brainerd. A liquor store owner, funeral car service owner, and small farmer, he served two terms, but was defeated by former Rep. Paul Gazelka in the August 10, 2010, Republican primary election. He was elected to the Crow Wing County Board in 2012 and re-elected unopposed in 2016; he represents the first district which contains the southern portion of Crow Wing County, including Fort Ripley, Roosevelt Township, Oak Lawn Township and the extreme northeast portion of the city of Brainerd. Koering was first elected to the senate in 2002, defeating longtime senator and Democrat Don Samuelson, who had been the senate president. He was re-elected in 2006, overcoming both primary and general election opponents.http://www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail.asp?ID=10797 Koering was a member of the senate's Agriculture and Veterans Committee, the Capital Investment Committee, the Health, Housing and Family Security Committee (on which he was the ranking minority party member), and the Higher Education Committee. He also served on the Finance subcommittees for the Agriculture and Veterans Budget and Policy Division, for the Health and Human Services Budget Division, and for the Higher Education Budget and Policy Division.http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/members/member_bio.php?leg_id=10797 Koering's positions tended to be conservative, including opposition to tax increases, opposition to abortion, support for tougher criminal sentences, and support for broad gun rights, including support for a general right to carry a concealed firearm. In a notable exception to that conservatism, he has sided with Senate Democrats in opposing restrictions on gay rights. He is believed to be the first openly gay Republican elected official in Minnesota, and was the only openly gay Republican member of the Minnesota Legislature to date. Koering effectively 'outed' himself by breaking from the Republican Party line on a procedural vote in the Minnesota Senate. The pivotal moment came on April 7, 2005, when then-State Senator Michele Bachmann used procedural tactics that would have forced a vote on her constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in Minnesota. This vote coincided with the gay and lesbian justFair lobby day at the Capitol, as well as the second anniversary of the death of Koering's mother. Koering explicitly stated his sexual orientation a week later. Some public commentary questioned how this disclosure would affect his prospects for re-election in 2006 in a rural, right-leaning district, but he won by over 12 percentage points.http://www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail.asp?ID=10797http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2006/campaign/results/stsenate_dist.php?district=12 However, he disappointed pro-same-sex marriage advocates by voting against the Minnesota Marriage and Family Protection Act, a DFL-backed proposal to legalize same-sex civil unions in the state. On June 15, 2010, gay news site TheSword.com stated that Koering went on a dinner date in Brainerd with gay pornographic actor Brandon Wilde. He admitted to the date with Wilde and told The Sword, \\"I don't see anything wrong with going out with him.\\" In light of the story, the Minnesota Republican Party further distanced themselves from Koering. After losing the August 2010 primary election to Tea Party movement- backed candidate Paul Gazelka by a vote of 57 to 43 percent, he announced his withdrawal from the Republican Party, backing DFL Party candidate Taylor Stevenson's bid for the District 12 seat. Koering drew national criticism for his comments regarding people who have died from drug overdose. He was quoted by the Brainerd Dispatch as saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre in such a big hurry to save somebody like this. I guess it sounds kind of harsh, but it kind of gets rid of a problem, in my mind,‚Äù during the March 19, 2019 Crow Wing County Board meeting.

The stadium was built in 1990 and holds 8,500 people. It is the spring training home of the Toronto Blue Jays, as well as home to the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Class A Florida State League and the Dunedin High School Falcons baseball team. The stadium has also been known as Knology Park (2004‚Äì2008) and Florida Auto Exchange Stadium (2010‚Äì2017). History From 1977 to 1989, the Blue Jays played at Grant Field, which had a seating capacity of 3,417. Grant Field opened in 1930 and was named after the mayor of Dunedin Albert J. Grant (served 1927‚Äì1928), who had donated the land. The first Toronto Blue Jays game ever was played there on March 11, 1977 when the Blue Jays beat the New York Mets 3‚Äì1. In 1990, at a cost of approximately $2.4 million, the City of Dunedin built a new stadium called Dunedin Stadium at the same location as Grant Field. It had a capacity of 6,106. The actual playing field and team clubhouses did not change. In the fall of 2000, the Toronto Blue Jays signed an agreement to remain in Dunedin for an additional 15 years pending a $12-million renovation. The state of Florida paid $6 million, Pinellas County $3 million, and the Jays and Dunedin paid the remainder for the renovations. The agreement took effect in March 2002. Part of the renovations have included a new two-story building that includes a clubhouse, training room, weight room, and office space that was built next to the stadium. The most recent renovations at Dunedin Stadium include remodeled restrooms and replacement of the grandstand seats. In February 1995, during the Major League Baseball strike, the Blue Jays considered holding regular season games at Dunedin Stadium if the regular season began with replacement players. Ontario law forbade the Blue Jays from using replacement players in Toronto. American League officials inspected the ballpark on February 21, 1995 in response to the club's request to host games in Dunedin. The strike ended in March 1995 and no regular season games were played at the park. Dunedin Stadium was once ranked by Sports Illustrated as one of the top five facilities to watch a Major League Baseball Spring training game. Dunedin has been the only spring home for the Toronto Blue Jays since their inception in 1977. The current park capacity is 5,509 individual seats and features include a press box level with air-conditioned skyboxes, three picnic areas, two air-conditioned rooms, a scoreboard with electronic message display, regulation-sized Major League playing field and lighting, two half-fields (one natural grass and one artificial turf), batting tunnels, and full concession capabilities. In addition, the administrative offices feature an executive boardroom, dining room and kitchen, classroom, clubhouse and workout and training facilities. =Renovation= The Blue Jays lease of the facility ran through 2017; however, they held the option to extend it by an additional five years twice. After investigating possible alternative sites to host their spring training facility, the team negotiated an $81 million renovation to the stadium ($33.3 million) and Englebert Complex ($47.8 million) in 2014 under which they would contribute $20 million (plus any cost overruns) with the rest coming from the state ($13.7 million), county ($41.7 million) and city ($5.6 million) governments. The club retains all revenue from sales at concessions and parking at the stadium, while they share revenue from naming rights with the city. The new lease agreement for the stadium lasts for 25 years, with the option to renew for a further 2 years five times. The City Commission approved the deal in November 2017, while the county agreed to approve a funding request for the project in April 2018. By September 2019 the budget for the renovation had increased to $102 million, with the team investing an extra $20 million and the city contributing $530,000. Groundbreaking took place in April 2019, with the project scheduled to be completed in time for the Jays' 2020 spring training. The stadium's capacity will be expanded from 5,500 to 8,500, with 6,500 fixed seats. Naming rights Beginning in 2004 the stadium was known as Knology Park as part of a naming agreement with Knology, a southeastern United States communications and entertainment company. This agreement expired on September 30, 2008. On November 7, 2010, the City of Dunedin announced that it had reached a 7-year, $181,000 agreement with the Florida Auto Exchange, a Dunedin car sales center, for the naming rights of Dunedin Stadium. The facility was renamed \\"Florida Auto Exchange Stadium\\" until October 1, 2017 when the agreement expired.Naming rights agreement between the City of Dunedin and Florida Auto Exchange In November 2019, the Jays announced that TD Bank had acquired naming rights for the renovated stadium, which would be renamed TD Ballpark.

The stadium holds approximately 9,500 people. It was the spring training home of the Colorado Rockies and Cleveland Indians, and is currently home to the Arizona Wildcats baseball team. Venue history and statistics First teams played at the field in 1937. Hi Corbett Field was originally called Randolph Municipal Baseball Park. In 1951, it was renamed in honor of Hiram Stevens Corbett (1886-1967), a former Arizona state senator who was instrumental in bringing spring training to Tucson, specifically by convincing Bill Veeck to bring the Cleveland Indians to Tucson in 1947. Veeck owned a ranch in Tucson at the time, and he and players sometimes rode Veeck's horses after the games. Veeck claimed that he moved the team's training camp from Florida to Arizona in order to avoid Florida's Jim Crow laws. Hi Corbett was remodeled in 1972 and renovated in 1992, 1997, 1999, and 2012. It is part of a larger city park complex, Gene C. Reid Park (which also includes the Reid Park Zoo) and Randolph Park, located between Broadway Boulevard and 22nd Street in midtown Tucson. The main playing field's dimensions are as follows: 349 feet in Right Field, 366 feet in Left Field, and 410 feet at its deepest in Center Field. The ballpark currently has a capacity of 9,500, including 598 box seats, 8,350 reserved seats, and 562 bleacher seats. There are also two ancillary fields for use in spring training, but these make no provision for spectators. For many years, Emil Bossard, groundskeeper for the Cleveland Indians, was in charge of Hi Corbett Field, during Spring Training. In 1959, he was considered the top groundskeeper in Major League Baseball and was inducted into the Major League Baseball Groundskeeper Hall of Fame in 2012. According to historian David Leighton, of the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, Emil Bossard Field and the street Bossard Place both located at Reid Park, are named in his honor.David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: Road, field named for legendary groundskeeper\\", Arizona Daily Star, September 22, 2014 Teams Hi Corbett served as the spring training home of Cleveland from 1947 through 1992. Cleveland announced in 1990 that they would depart Tucson and the city tried to attract the Baltimore Orioles to move to Arizona. Parts of the 1989 movie Major League were filmed at Hi Corbett Field where the production used members of the University of Arizona Wildcats baseball team as extras. From 1993 to 2010, Hi Corbett was the pre-season home of the expansion Colorado Rockies, who moved into Hi Corbett with their inaugural spring training. Hi Corbett is also closely associated with minor league baseball. Aside from the Lizards, the Tucson Cowboys (Class C; Arizona‚ÄìTexas League) played at Hi Corbett intermittently from the late 1930s until 1958. The original Tucson Toros (Class AAA; Pacific Coast League) played there from their inception in 1969 until 1997 (see below for new Toros team). The largest Tucson Toros crowd at Hi Corbett was 12,863 on May 17, 1981 against Salt Lake City. In 1997, the Toros essentially exchanged ownership and franchises with the nearby Phoenix Firebirds, so that the ex-Toros played in Scottsdale Stadium as the Firebirds, and the ex-Firebirds played at Hi Corbett as the Toros. In 1998 the Phoenix team relocated to Fresno, California and was renamed the Fresno Grizzlies, and the Tucson Toros became the Tucson Sidewinders, and played in the new Tucson Electric Park, which was renamed in January 2011 to Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium. The Arizona Fall League, a short season league for major league prospects, fielded a team at Hi Corbett in 1993 and 1994, known as the Tucson Javelinas. The team relocated to Peoria in 1995 (becoming the Peoria Javelinas) to limit travel distances to the Phoenix metropolitan area. USA Baseball was headquartered at Hi Corbett from 1997 to 2003. From 2004 to 2007 Hi Corbett was home to the Arizona Heat women's professional softball team. In addition to the large number of visiting teams that have appeared there as part of regular league play, Hi Corbett has hosted exhibition games featuring the Colorado Silver Bullets, Houston Astros and University of Arizona, among others. Baseball Hall of Fame members who played at Hi Corbett include Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Ted Williams and many others. On May 21, 2009, the Tucson Toros returned to Hi Corbett Field after an 11-year absence, playing as an Independent Professional Baseball League team of the Golden Baseball League. Hi Corbett Field was the home stadium of the Toros until they were evicted by the city of Tucson in 2011 before they could join the North American League. University of Arizona In 2012, the ballpark became the new home of the University of Arizona Wildcats baseball team. Through the first three-game series of the season against North Dakota State, the attendance at the stadium was a total of 8,870, which was nearly ¬º of the total home attendance for the Wildcats' previous season at Sancet Stadium, their longtime home on campus, located adjacent to McKale Center. Hi Corbett Field hosted both an NCAA Regional and Super Regional, as Arizona won both to advance to the 2012 College World Series. The relocation of the Wildcat baseball program to Hi Corbett has been noted as a major factor in the team's successful 2012 season, and their fourth national championship. Future In 2007, the Rockies asked for a package of improvements to Hi Corbett potentially totaling $10-20 million under the threat of a possible move to Goodyear. In response, Pima County chartered a regional sports and tourism authority, funded by tourism and other taxes. Such authority was approved both by the Arizona Legislature and voters of the county. The departure of the Chicago White Sox from Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium, has forced team management to expedite plans for a future move, as the Rockies have stated that they need two other teams in order for Tucson to be a viable spring training town for them. The Rockies decided to move to the new Salt River Fields at Talking Stick in 2011 on tribal land owned by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community near Scottsdale. The Arizona Diamondbacks share that facility. =University of Arizona= As noted above, in an effort to have its baseball program compete in the best possible facilities, in August 2011, the University of Arizona signed an agreement with the city of Tucson for Arizona baseball to play its home games at Hi Corbett for the 2012 season; the initial agreement was for five years with an option to renew the contract. The UA has made several upgrades to the facility, where the Wildcats previously played selected games in the 1960s and '70s. Hi Corbett is located about three miles southeast of the UA campus.UA Baseball to Play at Hi Corbett Field (press release from UA Intercollegiate Athletics) In 2013, the Wildcats ranked 21st among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 2,733 per home game. In March 2017, the University signed a new 25-year lease on Hi Corbett Field, taking over the day-to-day management of the baseball stadium from the City of Tucson.

It is often referred in short as Phoenix Muni. The stadium was built in 1964 and holds 8,775 people. It is currently the home to the Arizona State Sun Devils baseball program, having relocated to Phoenix Municipal Stadium at the start of their 2015 season. It is the former spring training home to the Oakland A's, having played their home games from 1982 to 2014. The San Francisco Giants held spring training at the ballpark from 1964 to 1981, when they moved to Scottsdale Stadium. Old Phoenix Municipal Stadium (1936‚Äì1963) The original Phoenix Municipal Stadium was located at Central and Mohave streets, near downtown Phoenix. The ballpark opened in 1936 and had seating for around 3,000 spectators. Lights were installed by 1937. The old stadium was used for various local baseball games, wrestling, and dog racing until 1946, when the New York Giants made arrangements to begin spring training there. The stadium required renovations and an injunction was filed against holding any further dog races at the stadium site to bring the Giants to town. The Giants played their first game against major league opposition at the old stadium on March 9, 1947, defeating the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in front of a crowd of 8,000. The Phoenix Senators of the Arizona-Texas league also held games there in 1947. The Giants renewed their agreement in April 1947 to stay at the stadium until 1950. They ultimately played there until 1963, when they moved to the new stadium. Stadium History (1964‚Äìcurrent) The Phoenix city council approved construction of a new municipal stadium at Papago Park on June 4, 1962, to fully replace the old stadium. Plans for the stadium notably included six water fountains, as they were not originally included at the then-new Dodger Stadium. However, construction was delayed a year, in part because the stadium meant to be partially funded by selling the land the old stadium sat on - only one bidder appeared at the auction, and only bid on the parking lot, leaving a funding gap. The council finally agreed to another approval on April 23, 1963, with the architect's proposed budget of $605,300. The first spring training game was played on March 8, 1964, in which the Giants beat Cleveland, 6-2. Willie Mays hit the first home run at the park, in front of a crowd of 8,582. In attendance, for the dedication ceremonies, were Commissioner Ford Frick, National League President Warren Giles, and Giants owner Horace Stoneham.Charlie Finley: The Outrageous Story of Baseball's Super Showman, p.84, G. Michael Green and Roger D. Launius. Walker Publishing Company, New York, 2010, The stadium hosted a \\"welcome home\\" rally for presidential candidate Barry Goldwater on October 31, 1964, shortly before the election. It was the first time the stadium had been filled to capacity. The city of Phoenix installed an evaporative cooling system in the stadium in 1966. The Phoenix Giants returned in 1966 as a Triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. That year the Giants signed a five-year lease on the stadium at $15,000/year to use Phoenix Muni for spring training, Triple-A games, and winter instructional league. They rebranded as the Firebirds in 1986. In 1981, the San Francisco Giants signed an agreement to move to Scottsdale Stadium because the city of Phoenix did not provide requested renovations. The Oakland Athletics, who previously trained in Scottsdale, signed a seven-year lease to move to the stadium. The A's also renovated the dugouts and training complex. The Phoenix Firebirds moved from the stadium in 1992 after entering discussions with the city of Scottsdale to play at the newly rebuilt Scottsdale Stadium. At the time of the move, the Firebirds' $10,000/year rent agreement did not come close to covering the city of Phoenix's maintenance expenses. In 2003, the stadium underwent a $6.4 million renovation. The press box facilities were enclosed - at the time, the stadium had the only open-air facilities in the Cactus League. New dugouts, better signage, improved concourse areas with benches, shading, and a historical timeline were all added.http://phoenix.gov/parks/sports/phxmuni.html =Arizona State Sun Devils= In 2013, The Arizona Board of Regents approved Arizona State University's 25-year lease to Phoenix Municipal Stadium.http://arizonasports.com/118/1608596/ASU-Baseball-to-move-to-Phoenix- Muni The stadium is 2.5 miles from Arizona State's main campus in Tempe (and as such, accessible via the Phoenix light rail system). The ASU baseball program has history at the site, as Reggie Jackson was the first college player to hit a home run out of Phoenix Municipal Stadium. The Sun Devils started play in 2015 after which Packard Stadium, their former venue, will be redeveloped to help pay for planned improvements to the ASU football facility, Sun Devil Stadium. Arizona State had previously played selected games at the stadium in the 1960s, especially against their rival, the University of Arizona. =Other events= The stadium has also hosted Arizona Fall League games during the fall. It hosted the home games of the Phoenix Desert Dogs until their 2013 move to Glendale.http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130324&content;_id=43213202&vkey;=news_milb&fext;=.jsp The Arizona Diamondbacks‚Äô rookie league team, the Phoenix Diamondbacks, also played in the stadium when the team played in the Arizona League. Several of the Arizona high school baseball championships are played there in early May. Lighting Main entrance The stadium's light poles are the original light poles which were installed at the Polo Grounds in New York City in 1940. They served Polo Grounds until 1964, when the stadium was demolished. Horace Stoneham, the Giants owner, shipped the light poles to Phoenix. Concerts Phoenix Muni hosted outdoor concerts from major touring acts in the years before Desert Sky Pavilion, an outdoor amphitheatre, opened on the west side of Phoenix in 1990. Black Sabbath and Blue √ñyster Cult performed at the stadium during their Black & Blue Tour on July 25, 1980. The Police performed at the stadium during their Synchronicity Tour on September 8, 1983. AC/DC performed at the stadium during their Fly on the Wall Tour on October 17, 1985. Pink Floyd performed, on two consecutive nights, at the stadium during their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour on April 25‚Äì26, 1988.

Designed by the owner of the Baltimore Orioles' Camden Yards, the new stadium was built in 1992 and holds 12,000 people.https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/scottsdale-stadium/History It has been the spring training home of the San Francisco Giants since 1984, when the capacity was just 4,721. The stadium hosted three games of the 2006 World Baseball Classic. History The stadium was built on the site of the old Scottsdale Stadium, which opened in 1956. The Baltimore Orioles (1956-58), Boston Red Sox (1959-65), Chicago Cubs (1967-78) and Oakland Athletics (1979-83) used old Scottsdale Stadium as their spring training base before the Giants moved here in 1984. The new stadium cost $7 million to build and was completed in under a year. In 1992, Angels pitcher Matt Keough was struck by a foul ball while sitting in the dugout during spring training and was critically injured. His life was saved in part because the stadium is across the street from a hospital. The stadium underwent a $23.1 million renovation in 2006. The renovations included a new team store, expanded clubhouse, baseball training and treatment room, batting tunnel, centerfield entrance, Charro Pavilion, and practice fields next to the stadium.https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/scottsdale- stadium/History In return, the San Francisco Giants agreed to play at the stadium for an additional 20 years, through 2025, with an option to extend the lease to 2035. Tenants The Giants hold their major league and minor league training operation at the two facilities. Scottsdale Stadium is consistently one of the top attended venues in Arizona's Cactus League. The Scottsdale Charros organize and promote San Francisco spring training in the city. Scottsdale Stadium was the home of the Phoenix Firebirds of the Pacific Coast League from 1992 until 1997, who had moved from Phoenix Municipal Stadium after the new stadium was completed. The Firebirds moved to Fresno, California, and became the Grizzlies, in order to make room for the National League's Arizona Diamondbacks, who began play in 1998. Scottsdale also hosted the Valley Vipers of the independent Western Baseball League in 2000, the only season of that team's existence. Arizona United SC of the United Soccer League played at Scottsdale in 2015. The stadium is also host of the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League, and hosts the Fall League's championship game at the end of November. During the summer the stadium is home the Arizona League Giants of the Arizona League.

She is the subject of a celebrated biography, Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess (1957), written by Hannah Arendt.Hannah Arendt (1958): Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess Arendt cherished Varnhagen as her \\"closest friend, though she ha[d] been dead for some hundred years\\". The asteroid 100029 Varnhagen is named in her honour. Life and works Rahel Antonie Friederike Levin was born to a Jewish family in Berlin. Her father, a wealthy jeweler, was a strong-willed man who ruled his family despotically. She became close friends with Dorothea and Henriette, the daughters of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. Through them she got to know Henriette Herz, with whom she would become most intimately associated throughout her life, moving in the same intellectual spheres. Together with Henriette Herz and her cousin, Sara Grotthuis n√©e Meyer, she hosted one of the most famous Berlin salons of the 1800s. Her home became the meeting place for artists, poets and intellectuals such as Schlegel, Schelling, Steffens, Schack, Schleiermacher, Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, Motte Fouqu√©, Baron Br√ºckmann, Ludwig Tieck, Jean Paul, and Friedrich Gentz. During a visit to Carlsbad in 1795 she was introduced to Goethe, whom she met again in Frankfurt am Main in 1815. After 1806, she lived in Paris, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Prague, and Dresden. This period was one of misfortune for Germany; Prussia was reduced to a small kingdom and its king was in exile. Secret societies were formed in every part of the country with the object of throwing off the tyranny of Napoleon. Levin herself belonged to one of these societies. Moritz Michael Daffinge . In 1814, she married the biographer Karl August Varnhagen von Ense in Berlin, after having converted to Christianity‚Äîthis also made her sister-in-law to the poet Rosa Maria Assing. At the time of their marriage, her husband, who had fought in the Austrian army against the French, belonged to the Prussian diplomatic corps, and their house in Vienna became a meeting place for Prussian delegates to the Congress of Vienna. In 1815, she accompanied her husband to Vienna, and then to Karlsruhe in 1816, where he became a Prussian representative. She returned to Berlin in 1819, when her husband retired from his diplomatic position. Though never the author of a major book, Rahel Varnhagen is remembered both for the intensity and variety of her correspondence. Six thousand letters have survived, out of an estimated ten thousand letters written by her in the course of her lifetime.Elon, 2003, The Pity Of It All, pp. 78‚Äì79. A few of her essays were published in Das Morgenblatt, Das Schweizerische Museum, and Der Gesellschafter; in 1830, her Denkbl√§tter einer Berlinerin was published in Berlin. Her husband, Karl August, edited and published her correspondence in the twenty years following her death. Her correspondence with David Veit and with Karl August was published in Leipzig, in 1861 and 1874‚Äì1875 respectively. Rahel Varnhagen died in Berlin in 1833. Her grave is located in the Dreifaltigkeitsfriedhof I Berlin-Kreuzberg. Her husband published two memorial volumes after her death containing selections from her work: Rahel, ein Buch des Andenkens f√ºr ihre Freunde (Rahel, a memorial book for her friends; 3 vols., 1834; new ed., 1903) and Galerie von Bildnissen aus Rahels Umgang (Gallery of portraits from Rahel's circle; 2 vols., 1836).The grave of Rahel Varnhagen in Berlin Relations with Judaism According to the Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), \\"Rahel always showed the greatest interest in her former coreligionists, endeavoring by word and deed to better their position, especially during the anti-Semitic outburst in Germany in 1819. On the day of her funeral Varnhagen sent a considerable sum of money to the Jewish poor of Berlin.\\" Amos Elon wrote about Rahel Varnhagen in his 2002 book, The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany, 1743-1933: > She hated her Jewish background and was convinced it had poisoned her life. > For much of her adult life she was what would later be called self-hating. > Her overriding desire was to free herself from the shackles of her birth; > since, as she thought, she had been \\"pushed out of the world\\" by her > origins, she was determined to escape them.

She considered her origins \\"a curse, a slow bleeding to > death.\\" ... The idea that as a Jew she was always required to be > exceptional‚Äîand go on proving it all the time‚Äîwas repugnant to her. \\"How > wretched it is always to have to legitimize myself! That is why it is so > disgusting to be a Jew.\\"Elon, 2003, The Pity Of It All, p. 81. Rahel's husband published an account of her deathbed scene, which Amos Elon described as \\"stylized and possibly overdramatised\\", including her alleged last words: > What a history! A fugitive from Egypt and Palestine, here I am and find > help, love, fostering in you people. With real rapture I think of those > origins of mine and this whole nexus of destiny, through which the oldest > memories of the human race stand side by side with the latest > developments...The thing which all my life seemed to me the greatest shame, > which was the misery and misfortune of my life‚Äîhaving been born a > Jewess‚Äîthis I should on no account now wish to have missed.Elon, 2003, The > Pity of It All, pp. 89‚Äì90. The poet Ludwig Robert was her brother, and she corresponded extensively with him. Her sister Rosa was married to Karel Asser. Ludmilla Assing and Ottilie Assing were her nieces-in-law.

The highway was designated in 1985 as a replacement for the decommissioned US-66. Although most of the highway follows Historic Route 66, the highway follows US-66's final alignment, joining Interstate 44 through Tulsa and Oklahoma City, while older versions of the route follow various city streets through both cities. The highway has retained its importance for most of its length due to its paralleling Interstate 44 which between Missouri and Oklahoma City (except in the cities of Tulsa and Oklahoma City) is a toll road. SH-66 currently has one spur route, designated SH-66B, in Wellston. Route description =Western terminus and Oklahoma City area= Former US-66 bridge over the North Canadian River in Oklahoma City Arcadia State Highway 66 begins at Business I-40 in El Reno (another old Route 66 segment), concurrent at this point with US-81. From this intersection, the highway heads due east. The highway briefly passes through a rural area after leaving El Reno, before transitioning into the Oklahoma City suburb of Yukon. In Yukon, the route runs along Main Street, and has a short concurrency with SH-4. SH-66 continues east, passing into Oklahoma City, where it becomes N.W. 39th Expressway. SH-66 has an interchange with the Kilpatrick Turnpike on the far west edge of the city. The highway passes just to the north of Lake Overholser. Near where the road crosses over the North Canadian River, the inlet to the lake, it crosses from Canadian County into Oklahoma County. N.W. 39th Expressway, still carrying SH-66, forms the main street of both Bethany and Warr Acres, two enclave suburbs of Oklahoma City. The street passes just to the south of Wiley Post Airport and provides access to Southern Nazarene University. After leaving Warr Acres, the highway re-enters Oklahoma City. SH-66 leaves N.W. 39th Expressway at an interchange with I-44 and SH-3/SH-74 (the Lake Hefner Parkway). SH-66 begins a concurrency with eastbound I-44, and for the remainder of its length, it will stay close to the interstate. SH-66 is unsigned through its time on the Oklahoma City freeway system. I-44, while concurrent with SH-66, runs along the north side of Oklahoma City, passing just south of Penn Square Mall, and meets Interstate 235 at a cloverleaf interchange at its northern terminus (north of the interchange, US-77 continues on as a freeway, the Broadway Extension). I-44 and SH-66 begin a concurrency with I-35 near Remington Park. The two interstates and the state highway head north through the northeast part of the city. At Hefner Road, the routes pass near the Frontier City amusement park. The highways then encounter an interchange which is the eastern terminus of the Kilpatrick Turnpike. This interchange is also where I-44 splits off to form the Turner Turnpike. I-35 and SH-66 leave Oklahoma City and enter the suburb of Edmond. On the north side of town, SH-66 exits the interstate, while US-77 joins it. SH-66 continues east out of town, providing access to Arcadia Lake. The highway then passes through the town of Arcadia, home of the Round Barn, a Route 66 landmark. The highway then serves Luther before exiting Oklahoma County. =Lincoln and Creek Counties= On the west side of Lincoln County, SH-66 produces a business loop to Wellston, SH-66B (below). Just beyond this junction, SH-66 serves as the northern terminus of SH-102. The highway continues east, meeting up again with SH-66B on the east side of Wellston. Near this junction, SH-66 has an interchange with the Turner Turnpike (still carrying I-44). The route continues to parallel the turnpike as it comes to an intersection with US-177. East of this junction, SH-66 passes through the town of Warwick, where it crosses the Deep Fork of the Canadian River. On the southwest side of Chandler, the county seat of Lincoln County, the route is joined by SH-18. The two routes turn north, passing through the core of the downtown area. On the north side of downtown, SH-66 splits off to the east. Seven miles (11 km) east of Chandler, the highway passes through the town of Davenport. The route next encounters Stroud, where SH-66 intersects State Highway 99 and US-377, which may serve as the northern terminus of US-377. East of Stroud, SH-66 passes into Creek County. The highway passes through the town of Depew northeast of Stroud. The route next passes through Bristow, where it has a brief concurrency with SH-16 and begins a more lengthy one with SH-48. SH-48/66 exit Bristow to the north, with an interchange where they cross the Turner Turnpike. Near unincorporated Bellvue, SH-66 splits away from SH-48 and turns back to the northeast. The highway crosses the Turner Turnpike again (with no interchange this time), then runs through Kellyville. Four miles (6.4 km) northeast of Kellyville, the highway begins a concurrency with SH-33. SH-33 and SH-66 will remain signed together as they enter the Tulsa metropolitan area. =Tulsa area= SH-33/66 next enter Sapulpa, the county seat of Creek County and a suburb of Tulsa. In Sapulpa, the two highways serve as the western terminus of SH-117. They then come to the intersection of Dewey Avenue and Main Street in downtown Sapulpa, where SH-33 ends. This intersection also serves as the southern terminus of SH-97. SH-66 continues east through the intersection, joined by US-75 ALT. The two highways intersect SH-117A at its northern terminus, and turn left to continue its alignment. US-75 ALT/SH-66 parallel the Turner Turnpike within sight distance for the remainder of their journey in Creek County. Near the Creek‚ÄìTulsa County line, the Turner Turnpike ends, and SH-66 merges onto the now toll-free I-44. US-75 ALT ends at the merge. I-44/SH-66 cut diagonally through the city of Tulsa. In West Tulsa, Interstate 244 branches off to serve the downtown area. I-44/SH-66 follow the Skelly Drive through midtown. The highways interchange with the Okmulgee Beeline, the US-75 freeway before crossing the Arkansas River. The next freeway interchange is with the Broken Arrow Expressway, carrying US-64 and SH-51, followed by the Mingo Valley Expressway, carrying US-169 I-244 then merges with I-44 at its eastern terminus. I-44/SH-66 cross into Rogers County and the suburb of Catoosa, serving as the southern terminus of SH-167. SH-66 then splits off from I-44, initially following an old alignment of the Interstate where it transitioned into the Will Rogers Turnpike. SH-66 then downgrades to an expressway as it passes through Catoosa, home of the Blue Whale. Northeast of Catoosa, near Verdigris, SH-66 intersects SH-266 at its eastern terminus. =Northeast Oklahoma= The next town that SH-66 serves after leaving the Tulsa area is Claremore, seat of Rogers County. In Claremore, SH-66 has brief concurrencies with SH-20 and SH-88. The highway continues northeast through Rogers County, bypassing Sequoyah to the west and serving as the western terminus of SH-28A in Foyil. The highway passes through Bushyhead northeast of Foyil, and then intersect SH-28 in Chelsea further northeast. The route then crosses into Craig County, where it serves the unincorporated place of White Oak. The SH-66 designation then comes to an end at US-60, which Route 66 historically followed into Vinita. History The present-day SH-66 was established to fill the void left when US-66 was decommissioned through Oklahoma in the early 1980s. SH-66 was designated as its replacement from El Reno to White Oak on April 1, 1985. The remainder of US-66 in Oklahoma was overlapped by other highways, principally I-40 and US-69, so the SH-66 designation was not applied to these sections of highway. On July 1, 1991, SH-66 was realigned in the vicinity of Luther. No further changes to the SH-66 designation have occurred since that time. Planned improvements by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation include reconstruction and widening of SH-66 from two to four lanes from Edmond to the Lincoln County line.http://www.okladot.state.ok.us/cwp-8-year- plan/cwp_ffy2016-ffy2023/cwp_ffy2016-2023.pdf SH-66B While US-66 was still active, the SH-66 designation was given to a loop route through Wellston. This incarnation of SH-66 effectively served as a Wellston business loop for US-66. This route was first established on June 26, 1934. SH-66B is long.

She was a first cousin of Empress K≈çjun of Japan. On her mother's side, she was also a first cousin of Princess Setsuko. Marriage Princess Masako was a leading candidate to wed the crown prince of Japan, the future Emperor Hirohito. Other candidates included Princess Kuni Nagako (who became the future Empress K≈çjun), and Tokiko Ichij≈ç, a peeress. The possibility of infertility and the feeble political influence of her family were among the reasons she was removed from the list of candidates. However, Princess Masako was selected instead to wed Crown Prince Euimin of Korea who had been held by Japanese government under the pretense of studying abroad in 1917. The wedding was held on 28 April 1920, at Korean King's Palace in Tokyo. Princess Masako was still a student at the Girls' Department of the Gakush≈´in Peers' School at the time and her new title became Her Royal Highness Bangja, Crown Princess Euimin. Despite an unfavorable fertility diagnosis prior to her marriage, she gave birth to a son, Prince Jin, on 18 August 1921. However, Prince Jin died under suspicious circumstances when she visited Korea with her husband on 11 May 1922. On 24 April 1926, Crown Princess Bangja received the formal title Her Majesty Queen Lee when the Emperor Sunjong, the elder brother of Crown Prince Euimin, died. Under the terms of the Japan‚ÄìKorea Annexation Treaty, the Korean royal title was demoted from that of \\"Emperor\\" to \\"King\\" and Crown Prince Euimin was never formally crowned as king; therefore Princess Masako continued to be styled \\"Bangja, Crown Princess Euimin\\". On 29 December 1929, she gave birth to a second son, Prince Gu. Life as last Crown Princess of Korea After the end of World War II, all former royal and peerage titles were abolished by the American occupation authorities. Republic of Korea President Rhee Syng-man's fear of Crown Prince Euimin's popularity prevented the family's homecoming, and they lived in destitution as Korean residents in Japan. In November 1963, Crown Princess Bangja and her family came back to Korea at the invitation of President Park Chung-hee and were allowed to live in Changdeok Palace in downtown Seoul.Naver dictionary http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=126171 However, by this time, Crown Prince Euimin was already unconscious from cerebral thrombosis and was rushed to Seoul Sungmo Hospital where he remained bedridden for the rest of his life. Thereafter, Princess Bangja devoted herself to the education of mentally and physically handicapped people. She successively became the chairman of various committees including the Commemorative Committee of Crown Prince Euimin, and the Myeonghwi-won, an asylum for deaf-and-dumb persons or patients suffering from infantile paralysis and she founded the Jahye School and the Myeonghye School, which helps handicapped people become socially adapted.

Broadcasting began on 2 January 1988. It is based in Alice Springs, where it has a studio and satellite uplink facility. Notably, it is controlled by Australian Aboriginals through ownership by Imparja Television Pty Ltd, and is widely regarded as a symbol of Aboriginal Australia. Most viewers receive Imparja via free to view satellite transmission, whilst a smaller proportion receive it via analogue terrestrial transmission. Imparja is an Arrernte word meaning footprints. The word is used to represent that Imparja Television aims to service Arrente people wherever they may live, from Mutitjulu to King's Canyon to Alice Springs to Tennant Creek and beyond. They describe their range as a footprint. In 2008, Imparja Television was identified on-air and in print as Nine Imparja, following its dropping of Network Ten affiliation. In 2009, the station again identifies as simply \\"Imparja\\" and \\"IMP\\", although the Nine Network's nine dots seen in the logo remain. History =Origins= The then Australian Broadcasting Tribunal was asked by the Federal Minister for Communications in October 1984 to inquire into the allocation of commercial television licences for a number of remote areas. Licences were granted in 1985 to the Golden West Network, which broadcast to Western Australia, and QSTV in north-eastern Australia. In 1986 hearings for the allocation of the licence began, and the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA), which began providing Central Australian radio programs in local languages in 1980, formed Imparja Television Pty Ltd as a company. Soon after, the Government of the Northern Territory announced support to underpin the viability of the Central Zone Remote Television Service (RCTS) by offering to purchase an estimated $2 million package of services from the successful applicant. The Government of South Australia undertook a similar promise, offering loans of $1 million to Imparja if they were successful. An extraordinary saga of political, legal and commercial intrigue then ensued during the protracted Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) hearing process, pitching Federal, State and Territory Governments against one another with loan promises being substantially watered down or withdrawn as it became apparent the CAAMA application may prevail. Windfall funding from the Australian Bicentennial Authority and the Aboriginal Development Commission ultimately underpinned the feasibility of the CAAMA bid and they were successfully allocated the licence. However subsequent Federal Administrative Tribunal court proceedings brought about by the unsuccessful applicant, Darwin based Territory Television Ltd., attempting to overturn the ABT's decision delayed construction commencement of the new service until May 1987. By October 1987 the new station had begun to build rebroadcast sites and new studios and a main transmitter based in Alice Springs were completed. Imparja's first test program, Australia versus Sri Lanka Test Cricket, was telecast on 2 January 1988 in Alice Springs. Two weeks later, on 15 January 1988, the station was officially inaugurated at Imparja Television's head office in Alice Springs by Minister for Communications Ralph Willis and Warren Snowdon, the Australian federal member of parliament for the Division of Lingiari in Northern Territory. Imparja became the first Aboriginal member of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the now- defunct Regional Television Association, both dominant organisations at the time. Imparja was chaired by Freda Glynn for its first ten years and, for a time, she was the only female chair of a television network in the world. Freda was one of the first three founders of CAAMA ‚Äì the others being John Macumba and Philip Batty. Imparja had an initial population reach of 62,000 people, which by 1993 had grown to 125,000. Imparja was available through retransmission sites at Ceduna, Coober Pedy, Leigh Creek and Woomera in South Australia, and Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Bathurst Island in the Northern Territory, as well as on the Optus Aurora satellite platform. Imparja initially carried programming from all three major Australian commercial television networks, but following aggregation of market area with QSTV, it affiliated with the Nine Network and Network Ten. Imparja also screened some ABC Television and SBS Television indigenous programs, all in addition to original programs commissioned by the station. =1990s= In 1990, Imparja Local News was launched as a fifteen-minute insert of local news into the national bulletin. The station also covered the Northern Territory general election live from its Alice Springs studios. This followed the lead taken in 1989 when the station began to produce weather reports for parts of the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales, presented by Lavinia Hampton. By 1993, Imparja's viewing audience had doubled to approximately 125,000 Australians. This in turn led to the increased allocation of government funding in 1994 to produce Yamba's Playtime, which was the station's first in-house televisual production. Yamba's Playtime features the station's official mascot, \\"Yamba\\". Also in 1994, the Imparja board of directors established the Imparja Business Development Sub Committee, to monitor and provide strategic recommendations for areas of growth for the company. In 1995, Imparja received the Telstra Indigenous Business Award for Business of the Year. Also in 1995, Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the Aussat A-Class satellites to the Optus B1 satellite, and the station's licence was renewed. Two new in-house productions were launched in 1996. The first being the BRACS Program, which was almost fully produced by Aboriginal communities, and Corroboree Rock, an Aboriginal music program. Imparja's parent company, Imparja Pty Ltd, converted to a proprietary company in 1997, whilst in the late 1990s, Imparja moved to digital satellite technology on the Optus Aurora platform. This meant that Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the Optus B1 satellite to the Optus C1 satellite. =2000s= By 2001 the station's coverage area had grown to include over 430,000 people. Around this time 'Imparja Info Channel' ('Channel 31') was launched, providing additional programming, news, and community information to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as Indigenous Community Television (ICTV). In 2007, the whole channel was replaced by National Indigenous Television (NITV). Imparja faced criticism by a number of community groups in 2004, following the station's decision to introduce advertising for alcohol for the first time. The network pledged to donate 30% of the total income received from alcohol advertising towards alcohol and substance abuse programs in communities. In 2005, Imparja National News, which primarily covered the news in Alice Springs in addition to other national and international news stories, was axed. The move was taken in anticipation of the Remote Eastern & Central Australia TV1 licence area being merged with that of Darwin. Regulations imposed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority relating to minimum levels of local news coverage led to 2006 reinstatement of Imparja National News. The news service began broadcasting again from the middle of February 2006, with Ryan Liddle as presenter. In the mid-2000s, it was widely expected that the Australian Communications and Media Authority would merge the \\"Darwin\\" and \\"Remote Eastern and Central Australia\\" commercial television licence areas. This would have most likely seen Imparja Television become a Network Ten affiliate in Darwin. However, this did not eventuate. Instead PBL Media and Southern Cross Broadcasting, the two existing Darwin Commercial licence holders were invited to bid individually or together. Their successful joint bid used a company called Darwin Digital Television. On 3 February 2008, Imparja Television updated its logo removing the emblem, which had been present on the logo for two decades. The logo change coincided with Imparja dropping Network Ten affiliation, becoming a sole Nine Network affiliate, in addition to axing Imparja National News, and also adding Nine Network's dots to its new logo. =2010s= On 19 May 2010, the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) approved a licence for a new remote area digital-only TV channel, a joint venture by Imparja Pty Ltd and Southern Cross Central.. It was launched on 30 June 2010 as \\"Ten Central (CDT)\\". It had two feeds, Ten Central North (QLD/NT) and Ten Central South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas). In December 2010, Imparja Television began broadcasting on terrestrial digital TV and the new VAST satellite service. This expansion included the establishment of two feeds for these platforms, Imparja North (Qld/NT) and Imparja South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas). As of 2010, their programming is exactly the same. Imparja Pty Ltd also began to launch digital channels 9Go! and 9Gem. As of the moment, Imparja continues to stream the HD feed of 9Gem, which was rebranded as a standard definition channel (9Gem later launched a separate HD channel in 2019) in Nine Network-only on 26 November 2015 in its metropolitan and Darwin stations, along with 9Life and the relaunch of 9HD. There are currently no plans at this stage for Imparja to launch an HD simulcast or introduce 9Life to its viewers. It will continue with its existing lineup of three broadcast channels. Programming Imparja Television's headquarters in Alice Springs, 2015 Imparja Television is a sole Nine Network affiliate. The station previously broadcast both Nine and Ten programming, however it stopped broadcasting Network Ten programming on 3 February 2008. Imparja Television has also aired original programs produced by local Aboriginal community members, such as Bush Mechanics and the children's program Yamba's Playtime. Imparja also airs programming relating to local Australian rules football and community sports, as well as news updates and religious thought for the day programs. Imparja Television also regularly broadcasts films created by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, which is a shareholder of its parent company. Imparja's programming schedule is currently based on the Nine Network schedule for Brisbane (based on Eastern Standard Time). Prior to February 2008, scheduling was generally based on Central Standard Time, reflecting its Alice Springs-based heritage. As a result, programs are now broadcast half an hour earlier than they previously would have been under the previous arrangement. =News and current affairs= Imparja does not currently produce its own evening regional news bulletin. In 2008, Imparja replaced Imparja National News ‚Äì a 30-minute, weeknightly program combining local and national/international news ‚Äì with local news updates, plus a 30-minute local news magazine program, Footprints (which later ceased production in 2009). The news updates were presented by Emma Groves from 2014 until July 2016. This brings Imparja's daily news service roughly into line with its competitor in the Remote Eastern and Central Australia licence area, Southern Cross Central (QQQ). The 6:00 pm (AEST) time slot is filled by a simulcast of Nine News Queensland. Imparja cites its geographic distribution, with a majority of the remote licence area's viewers now located in Queensland, as a \\"key factor\\" in selecting the Queensland bulletin. In 2009 Imparja began airing the Darwin edition of Nine News live at 6:30 pm (AEST) on weekdays, immediately following the Brisbane edition, in place of A Current Affair ‚Äì thereby restoring a Northern Territory-based bulletin to the station. =Sport= Imparja airs most sports coverage from the Nine Network, including rugby league, cricket, golf and tennis. The station also broadcast motorsport and Australian rules football coverage until 2008. Availability Imparja Television broadcasts throughout most of the Northern Territory, and also to some remote parts of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and Norfolk Island. It is generally available by satellite on the VAST or Optus Aurora platforms, though in some locations it is broadcast terrestrially. Imparja Television has the largest geographic range of any commercial television network in Australia. Imparja is also received on the Spirit of Tasmania Bass Strait Ferries. Imparja Television was previously available in New Zealand until March 2008 when the New Zealand government pressured the Australian government to remove the service from the satellite footprint that includes New Zealand. The total population serviced by Imparja Television is over 700,000 people, boasting the largest footprint in the southern hemisphere. Imparja is also available in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea through the HiTRON subscription television service.HiTRON Limited ‚Äì Papua New Guinea :: MMDS TV Logos Imparja Television's first logo was developed from a painting produced by an Arrernte artist and traditional owner. The logo symbolised the MacDonnell Ranges, the Todd River and the Yeperenye caterpillar. An updated version designed by Bruce Dunlop Associates debuted on 30 January 2006, adding a blue sphere behind the emblem. When Imparja re-affiliated with Nine Network, the long-time emblem was replaced by the Nine Network dots.

The Scots pines of the Caledonian Forest are directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the Late Glacial; arriving about 7000 BC. The forest reached its maximum extent about 5000 BC, after which the Scottish climate became wetter and windier. This changed climate reduced the extent of the forest significantly by 2000 BC. From that date, human actions (including the grazing effects of sheep and deer) reduced it to its current extent. Today, that forest exists as 35 remnants, as authenticated by Steven & Carlisle (1959) (or 84 remnants, including later subjective subdivisions of the 35) covering about or . The Scots pines of these remnants are, by definition, directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the ice age. These remnants have adapted genetically to different Scottish environments, and as such, are globally unique; their ecological characteristics form an unbroken, 9000-year chain of natural evolution with a distinct variety of soils, vegetation, and animals. To a great extent the remnants survived on land that was either too steep, too rocky, or too remote to be agriculturally useful. The largest remnants are in Strathspey and Strath Dee on highly acidic, freely drained glacial deposits that are of little value for cultivation and domestic stock. An examination of the earliest maps of Scotland suggests that the extent of the Caledonian Forest remnants has changed little since 1600. History Following the last glacial period, trees began to recolonise what is now the British Isles over a land bridge which is now beneath the Strait of Dover. Forests of this type were found all over what is now the island of Great Britain for a few thousand years, before the climate began to slowly warm in the Atlantic period, and the temperate coniferous forests began retreating north into the Scottish Highlands, the last remaining climatic region suitable for them in the British Isles (see Climate of Scotland). Caledonian pinewoods near Loch an Eilein The native pinewoods that formed this westernmost outpost of the taiga of post-glacial Europe are estimated to have covered as a vast wilderness of Scots pine, birch, rowan, aspen, juniper, oak and a few other hardy species. On the west coast, oak and birch predominated in a temperate rainforest ecosystem rich in ferns, mosses and lichens. Etymology Mam Sodhail as seen from Glen Affric The name comes from Pliny the Elder who reveals that 30 years after the Roman invasion of Britain their knowledge of it did not extend beyond the neighbourhood of silva caledonia. He gives no information about where the silva caledonia was, but the known extent of the Roman occupation suggest that it was north of the River Clyde and west of the River Tay. Legend and folklore In the Matter of Britain, the forest is the site of one of King Arthur's Twelve Battles, according to the Historia Brittonum, in which the battle is called Cat Coit Celidon. Scholars Rachel Bromwich and Marged Haycock suggest that the army of trees animated by sorcerers in the Old Welsh poem Cad Goddeu (\\"Battle of the Trees\\") are intended to be the Caledonian Forest.Green, Thomas (2007). Concepts of Arthur, p. 64\\\\. Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus. . In related Merlin literature, the figure of Myrddin Wyllt retreated to these woods in his madness after the Battle of Arfderydd in the year 573. He fled from the alleged wrath of the king of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, after the slaying of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio. This is written in the two Merlinic poems in Middle Welsh Yr Oinau and Yr Afallenau in the Black Book of Carmarthen. The forest is also the retreat of another character named Lailoken from the Vita Kentigerni, who also fled into the woods in a fit of madness and who may be the original model for Myrddin Wyllt. In the Middle Welsh story Culhwch and Olwen, the main character Culhwch is the son of a king named Celyddon Wledig, who may or may not be related to the forest in name. Another figure from the same story, Cyledyr Wyllt hints at a close relationship of the forest being a retreat for people who suffered from a special kind of madness or gwyllt (Irish geilt). In line 994 to 996 of the story, it is briefly explained, \\"a Chyledyr Wyllt y uab, a llad Nwython a oruc a diot y gallon, a chymhell yssu callon y dat, ac am hynny yd aeth Kyledyr yg gwyllt.\\" (\\"and his son Kyledyr the Wild. Gwynn killed Nwython and cut out his heart, and forced Kyledyr to eat his father's heart, and that is how Kyledyr went mad\\"). Though not named directly, the very name Kyledyr Wyllt is close to the two related notions of the forest of Celyddon being where people suffering madness or gwyllt hide. Wildlife Western capercaillie - a species that depends on the Caledonian Forest Being a unique ecosystem in the British Isles, the Caledonian Pinewoods are home to some of the islands' rarest wildlife. It is considered to be one of the last remaining wildernesses in the British Isles. Breeding bird species in Caledonian pine forests found breeding nowhere else in the British Isles: * Western capercaillie * Common goldeneye * European crested tit * Parrot crossbill * Scottish crossbill Breeding bird species in Caledonian pine forests rare elsewhere in the British Isles: * Black grouse * Red crossbill * Goosander * Siskin * Redpoll * Long-eared owl * Osprey * Red-breasted merganser * Redwing * Temminck's stint * Wood sandpiper * Horned grebe * Golden eagle Mammal species present in Caledonian pine forests: Red deer in Caledonian pinewood * Eurasian beaverThe Scottish Beaver Network (viewed June 11th 2009) * Feral goat * Mountain hare * European pine marten * Red deer * Red fox * Red squirrel * Roe deer * European wildcat Mammal species extinct in Caledonian pine forests: * Aurochs * Brown bear * Eurasian lynx * Gray wolf * Eurasian elk (Called moose in North American English) * Tarpan (wild horse) * Wild boar Conservation A review of the native pinewoods of Scotland Steven & Carlisle (1959) highlighted the plight of the remaining 35 ancient pinewood sites, many of which had been damaged by felling, fire and intensive grazing from sheep and deer. A later review in the 1980sBain C.G. (1987). Native Pinewoods in Scotland: A Review 1957-1987, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Sandy. showed that further damage had occurred through ploughing and planting with non-native conifers with less than 12,000 ha of the ancient habitat remaining. A subsequent guide to the ancient pinewoods reviews the conservation story and provides a summary of the management in each site as well as a guide on how to reach all the woods using public transport, walking, and cycling.Bain C.G. (2013) The Ancient Pinewoods of Scotland, A Travellers Guide. Sandstone Press, Dingwall Much of remaining Caledonian pine forest is fully protected, and much of the forest now lies within the Cairngorms National Park. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Forestry and Land Scotland also own several areas of pinewood on their reserves. One of the largest remaining areas is Ballochbuie Forest on the Balmoral Estate, which is protected as a Special Area of Conservation under the European Union Habitats Directive. Scientific research continues on the ecology of the Caledonian Forest and its restoration. Populations of the rare groundcover, Linnaea borealis, may be too isolated from one another to produce viable seed. Diversity of fungi has also been affected by the decrease in habitat. The agaric fungus Mycena purpureofusca is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods, and it is considered an indicator species for that habitat type. Fire appears to increase the natural recruitment of Scots pine seedlings. =Regeneration= The charity Trees for Life (Scotland) has been working to conserve the remaining forest, and reforest areas where it has been lost, using fences to prevent deer from eating saplings. This involves the reintroduction of the full range of native flora, including mycorrhizal fungi that assist soil regeneration.\\"Trees for Life - What we do\\"\\"‚ÄòMagical' mushroom mix to boost regrowth of lost Scottish forests\\" =Reintroductions= In recent years, there has been a growing interest to reintroduce animals which are currently extinct in Great Britain, back into Caledonian pine forests. Corporations have been set up to persuade the government to allow this. The long-running campaign to reintroduce the Eurasian beaver to Knapdale in Argyll has been successful,\\"They're back!\\" The Scottish Beaver Network (viewed 11 June 2009) and there is some support for the reintroduction of the grey wolf and Eurasian lynx. Recently, some landowners have announced plans to build large game reserves on their land and release the species within them. Paul Lister plans to release Eurasian lynx, brown bear, grey wolf, elk, wild boar and species already present in Scotland into a huge enclosure at his estate, Alladale Wilderness Reserve, although releasing top predators such as wolves and bears has become a difficult proposition with local and national regulations. An initial trial enclosure of was built with elk, wild boar, red deer and roe deer. Remaining pinewoods Bain (2013) lists 38 ancient pinewood sites in Britain which have been identified as the most genuinely native and natural. All of them occur in the Scottish Highlands. The Caledonian Pinewood Inventory breaks these down into 84 smaller sub-units of the main sites. In March 2019, as part of the implementation of the Forestry and Land Management (Scotland) Act 2018, the Scottish Government listed 84 sites as Caledonian pinewood in regulations, given below.

The character was popular, and on the strength of the Black Terror's sales, Nedor made Exciting Comics a monthly magazine starting with issue #11 (July 1941). The Black Terror was the most popular superhero in Nedor's stable, and appeared in a quarterly solo comic book as well as the lead feature in America's Best Comics and Exciting Comics until 1949. Some Black Terror stories were written by Patricia Highsmith before she became an acclaimed novelist. The character has been revived by various publishers over the years, including AC Comics, Eclipse Comics, America's Best Comics, and Dynamite Entertainment. Exciting Comics The Black Terror's secret identity was pharmacist Bob Benton, who formulated a chemical he called \\"formic ethers\\", which gave him various superpowers. He used these powers to fight crime with his sidekick, Tim Roland, together known as the \\"Terror Twins\\". His love interest is secretary Jean Starr, who initially despises Benton and loves the Black Terror, but later discovers that they're the same person. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"The Black Terror has enemies ranging from Nazis to mad scientists like Thorg (he of the \\"million dollar death ray\\"), the femme fatale Lady Serpent (who has a hypnotic glance), and the Japanese scientist Hanura and his \\"electro-hypnotizer\\", which is used to assassinate American generals and admirals.\\" With the popularity of superheroes fading in the late 40s, the Black Terror's series ended with issue #27 (June 1949). Later appearances =AC Comics= In 1983 AC Comics revised the Black Terror, starting in their Americomics title. In it, now- retired Bob Benton (called Mark Benton in this version) returns to action after an attempt to shake him down for protection money leads to the death of his wife. He would operate as an over-the-top vigilante, now just called the \\"Terror\\".Americomics #2, June 1983 Later, most likely due to trademark issues, he became a criminal enforcer known as the \\"Terrorist\\".Nightveil #2, 1985 =Alter Ego= In Roy Thomas' Alter Ego mini-series from 1986, several Golden Age characters were used, but renamed. The Black Terror (renamed \\"The Holy Terror\\") made an appearance.Alter Ego #1-4, 1986 =Darkline Comics= Bob Benton made a single appearance in the fourth issue of Darkline Comics' Dark Adventures. In the script by Vic Peterson and art by Thompson O'Rourke, Benton's exposure to his secret formula has made him ageless and sleepless, and he begins a new war on crime under the name \\"Terror Knight.\\"Dark Adventures #2, 1987 =Eclipse Comics= Eclipse Comics did a three-issue mini-series \\"revival\\" of the Black Terror in 1989. In this series, the character is an undercover FBI agent operating against organized crime who would dress up like the Black Terror for certain operations. He had no superpowers or any connection to the original character.Black Terror #1-3, 1989 =America's Best Comics= America's Best Comics #7 October 1943 The Black Terror, along with other heroes from Nedor Comics, were revived by Alan Moore in 2001 in his series Tom Strong, published by America's Best Comics. This revival set the characters on a parallel world called Terra Obscura, which was also the title of the resulting mini-series. In Tom Strong #11, Moore and co-creator Chris Sprouse more fully introduce the idea of Terra Obscura being a parallel Earth, \\"but in our own dimension. In our own galaxy.\\" In this issue, Tom Strange is revealed to have run across the Milky Way for 30 years to reach Strong for help in stopping an alien menace that killed or imprisoned most of the science heroes of Terra Obscura. Strong himself theorized that the duplicate Earth \\"must be due to some near-inconceivable fluke of mathematics, of statistical probability.\\"Tom Strong #11, 2001 The parallel Earth, as revealed by Strange, was formed much as our own, except that once Earth had completely formed, something large collided and combined with it ‚Äî a vast spacecraft. The pilot of the spacecraft survived in the Moon, until awakened by astronauts on July 20, 1969. It apparently followed them back to Earth, where it began construction of a ship to return home ‚Äî by converting the entire Earth into a spaceship. In the process, it was engaged in battle by the members of SMASH. It killed some members, and trapped others in suspended animation for 30 years, until freed by the combined efforts of Tom Strong and Tom Strange. In Tom Strong #12, it is revealed that the Black Terror had been killed in battle with the alien. However, Benton, a polymath, had transferred his consciousness into a computer program called Terror 2000.Tom Strong #12, 2001 In the Terra Obscura series, the Terror 2000 program institutes a crime prevention program in Invertica City, wherein technologically produced versions of the Black Terror (referred to as the Terror) fight crime. A corporation running the program tries to sell it to other cities in the US. Eventually, the Terror transfers its consciousness into the now deceased Tim and tries to acquire power from the returning Captain Future's spaceship. He is defeated by a time travelling version of his original self, the Black Terror.Terra Obscura Vol. 1 #1-6, Vol. 2 #1-6, 2003-2005 =Image Comics= The Black Terror is seen in the Mike Allred illustrated \\"Stardust the Super Wizard\\" story in Image Comics' Next Issue Project #1 (also known as Fantastic Comics #24, January 2008). He can be seen with many other notable Golden Age characters, including Daredevil, Miss Masque, the Green Lama, the Face, the Phantom, the Fighting Yank, and Samson, who headlines the book. He also made a small appearance on the cover and in some panels of Savage Dragon #141 (November 2008). =Wild Cat Books= In June 2008, pulp publisher Wild Cat Books released Legends of the Golden Age, a prose anthology featuring new stories of the Black Terror and Lev Gleason's Daredevil. =Dynamite Entertainment= Black Terror was one of several Golden Age characters to appear in the comic book series Project Superpowers, by writer Jim Krueger and artist Alex Ross. He was also the first in the series to get a spin-off series, written by Krueger with art by Mike Lilly. In the Black Terror series, which began in November 2008, the Terror leads a one-man assault on the White House in search of his lost partner, Tim. The series was cancelled at #14 in 2011. The character appears in the 2013 Masks series along other pulp heroes. =Metahuman Press= The 2009 Metahuman Press serial Out for Vengeance uses both the Black Terror and Black Fury as a basis for the character. He maintains the traditional secret identity and costume. The series is set in the modern day and involves Robert Benton suddenly finding himself young and semi-amnesiac in the city of New Salem. =Heroes Inc.= The webcomic Heroes Inc. started in 2009 and takes place in an alternate reality where the allies of World War II lost the war. In present day, the American Crusader gathers DNA from Golden Age heroes in order to create a new generation of heroes. One of these Golden Age heroes is the Black Terror (now going by the alias Duncan Boone), who is currently on death row for first degree murder. =Curse of the Black Terror= In February 2011, Broken Soul Press launched a webcomic called Curse of the Black Terror. The comic is described as a superhero/noir story. The webcomic follows a re-imagined version of the Black Terror. Writer Curtis Lawson has stated that the story keeps the original Black Terror's history mostly intact and that his new Black Terror is a Legacy Hero. This new Black Terror features a new costume, but the same powers as the original. His identity has not been revealed. The visual re-design of the Black Terror in this webcomic was the work of artist Kundo Krunch. =Moonstone Books= In 2011 Eric M. Esquivel and Ander Sarabia created a version of The Black Terror called \\"The Blackest Terror\\"\\", who is more of an urban revolutionary, obsessed with social justice, than a status- quo-enforcing superhero. Theirs is the first version of Robert Benton to be portrayed as an African-American. Blackest Terror also appears in their book Thor: Unkillable Thunder Christ, also published by Moonstone Books.The Blackest Terror #1, 2011 Film The Black Terror appears alongside other Golden Age superheroes in the independent film Avenging Force: The Scarab.

Geography The range stretches from the south of Dunhuang some 800 km to the southeast, forming the northeastern escarpment of the Tibetan Plateau and the southwestern border of the Hexi Corridor. The eponymous Qilian Shan peak, situated some 60 km south of Jiuquan, at , rises to 5,547 m. It is the highest peak of the main range, but there are two higher peaks further south, Kangze'gyai at with 5,808 m and Qaidam Shan peak at with 5,759 m. Other major peaks include Gangshiqia Peak in the east. The Nan-Shan range continues to the west as Yema Shan (5,250 m) and Altun Shan (Altyn Tagh) (5,798 m). To the east, it passes north of Qinghai Lake, terminating as Daban Shan and Xinglong Shan near Lanzhou, with Maoma Shan peak (4,070 m) an eastern outlier. Sections of the Ming Dynasty's Great Wall pass along its northern slopes, and south of northern outlier Longshou Shan (3,616 m). The Qilian mountains are the source of numerous, mostly small, rivers and creeks that flow northeast, enabling irrigated agriculture in the Hexi Corridor (Gansu Corridor) communities, and eventually disappearing in the Alashan Desert. The best known of these streams is the Ejin (Heihe) River. The region has many glaciers, the largest of which is the Touming Mengke. These glaciers have undergone acceleration in their melting in recent decades. The characteristic ecosystem of the Qilian Mountains has been described by the World Wildlife Fund as the Qilian Mountains conifer forests. Biandukou (), with an altitude of over 3500 m, is a pass in the Qilian Mountains. It links Minle County of Gansu in the north and Qilian County of Qinghai in the south. History View of Qilian Mountains The Shiji mentions the \\"Qilian mountains\\" together with Dunhuang in relation to the homeland of the Yuezhi. This Qilian however has been suggested to be the mountains now known as Tian Shan, 1,500 km to the west. Dunhuang has also been argued to be the Dunhong mountain.Liu, Xinru, Migration and Settlement of the Yuezhi-Kushan: Interaction and Interdependence of Nomadic and Sedentary Societies (2001) Qilian () is said to be a Xiongnu word meaning \\"sky\\" () according to Yan Shigu, a Tang Dynasty commentator on the Hanshu.

The first of these were the K&F; models, produced between 1945 and 1946. The early K&F; and Fender amplifiers relied upon vacuum tube circuitry, with the company adding solid-state models in the late 1960s. Early amplifiers: K&F; and Woodie The first \\"Fender\\" amplifiers were manufactured by Leo Fender and Doc Kauffman, doing business as the K&F; Manufacturing Corporation. In a steel case, most were finished in a \\"gray crinkle\\" finish, baked in the Kauffman family oven. They were made in three sizes, 1√ó8\\" (one 8-inch speaker), 1√ó10\\", and 1√ó15\\". They are all very rare today and few have survived. The first amplifiers made in-house by the Fender Electric Instrument Company have been dubbed the Woodie series, built in 1946 through 1948. They included the Model 26 Deluxe, the Princeton, and the Professional. Tweed models 1953 Fender Champ in tweed covering, wide-panel cabinet Fender amplifiers became established with the tweed series, wood cases covered in varnished cotton twill in the manner of suitcases of the era. (The nickname is a misnomer, as tweed is a coarse woollen fabric, often woven in a twill pattern.) They were produced for more than a decade. The first cloth used was an off-white fabric, followed by a horizontal-stripe two-tone pattern, and finally a two-tone twill. The twill covering was first used in 1946 on the Dual Professional, a twin 10\\" 6L6-powered model of which only 400 were made before being renamed \\"the Super Amp\\" in 1948. These early models are referred to as \\"TV-Fronts\\" due to the shape of the cabinet when viewed from above. The Dual Pro was the first twin-speaker amplifier, and also the first to employ a finger-jointed pine cabinet and the amp with a top-facing control panel. The construction of the chassis was changed as well, mounted to the back with the tubes pointed down, as opposed to having the chassis mounted on the top of the cabinet. This has the benefit of providing ease of access to the inside while providing a strong top. Fender largely ceased the twill covering in 1960, though the Harvard continued until 1963, and the Champ until 1964. At the beginning of the \\"tweed\\" era, Fender constructed many of its cabinets in \\"TV front\\" style, changing around 1950 predominantly to the \\"wide panel\\", where the top and bottom panels are wider than the side. Fender later constructed them with \\"narrow panel\\", in which all the panels have more or less the same width. Toward the end, despite keeping such construction, Fender utilized Tolex to cover its amps. Brownface (Brown and Blonde) Blonde twin, 1963 The Brownface series was introduced in 1959 and discontinued in 1963. This period marked the beginning of Fender's use of Tolex to cover amp cabinets. The name 'brownface' stems from the brown-colored control panels, common to both the brown- and cream/blonde- Tolex-covered amps. The brownface amps originally featured a dark maroon or \\"oxblood\\" grillcloth, which was changed to \\"wheat\\" in 1962-63. The shift from tweed to Tolex occurred in limited production in 1960. The tolex on the earliest versions in this era was pinkish brown and rough textured. There were only six amplifiers covered in tolex originally, the Professional Series: Bandmaster, Concert, Pro, Super, Twin (production halted Feb-May 1960, resumed as the blonde Twin) and Vibrasonic. These were considered a step above the student models (Champ, Harvard, Princeton) which remained tweed-covered in 1960. Grillcloth was initially the same as used in the previous tweed era, maroon with gold stripe. Beginning in mid to late 1961, Fender introduced another color combination: a smoother but still light brown tolex with a dark maroon or \\"oxblood\\" grillcloth. By mid-1961, after this short-lived look, Fender was using the darker brown tolex which was a mainstay for many of the mid-1961 to 1963 amps. Between 1961 and 1963, there were three different grillcloth colors: wheat, brown, and maroon and many tolex-grille color combinations are found suggesting that Fender was not reluctant to use up whatever stocks of materials were on hand. The Brown amplifiers included all of the all-in-one combo models except the flagship Twin and Vibrasonic, and the little Champ which retained its \\"tweed\\" (twill) covering. The Blonde amplifiers included all of the piggyback Fender amps (the Tremolux, Bassman, Showman, and Bandmaster) as well as the Twin and Vibrasonic combos. Two different colors of grillcloth were featured on the blondes, oxblood and wheat. There are several experimental Fender Tweed amps in blonde. While the majority of the piggybacks were produced in blonde tolex, there are a few examples of the brown tolex Bassman amplifiers. Accomplishments for the company's amplifier division during these years include the introduction of the stand-alone spring reverb unit in 1961, followed by incorporation of the reverb circuit within a combo-amp design with the 1963 Vibroverb. Other changes include the shift of the top-of-the-line model from the traditional Twin to include other models, like the Vibrasonic in early 1960, as well as the blonde Showman in 1961. Fender began using silicon rectifiers to reduce heat and voltage sag caused by tube rectifiers, and introduced an all-new, very complex Tremolo circuit (or, as it referred by Fender - \\"vibrato\\"). The Deluxe made the transition in 1961. The circuit was also changed to include a tremolo effect, and the output was increased. As the brown-era wore on, the plight of the smaller amps was varied. They all remained in name at least except for the 1x10\\" Harvard which was not continued through 1961. The 1x8\\" Champ-Amp remained a tweed-covered through 1963 and into 64 when it made the change to black tolex. The 1x10\\" Vibrolux remained a tweed amp until it was upgraded in 1961 to a single 12\\" speaker powered by a duet of 6L6 power tubes and a larger output transformer. Also upgraded from tweed was the Princeton which acquired its brown tolex in 1962 along with a completely redesigned, more powerful twin-6v6 circuit and a larger speaker array: 1x10\\". Blackface Blackface Deluxe Reverb Blackface Princeton Reverb The Blackface amplifiers were produced between 1963 and 1967 (some units continued to be made into early 1968). The earliest blackface piggyback and large combo amps (Twin) had bodies covered in blonde tolex, with the new black control panel. The white control knobs continued briefly before giving way to black skirted \\"hat shaped\\" numbered knobs. New circuitry featuring bright switches. In 1964 the piggyback units began to be covered in black tolex. The blackface cosmetics were phased out at the end of 1967 (though some continued to be made on into early 1968); they returned for a brief period in 1981 before their discontinuation the following year. John Lennon used a circa 1963 non-reverb Fender black face Deluxe amp. It can be seen in the videos for \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Revolution\\". He loved the amp and it had a different sound from the Deluxe Reverb model. Blackfaced cosmetics do not necessarily mean \\"pre-CBS\\" since the CBS company takeover took place in 1965 and amps with blackfaced cosmetics were produced up to 1967. After the buyout the front panels were changed from \\"Fender Electric Instrument Co.\\" to \\"Fender Musical Instruments\\". No real changes were made to the amps until the silverfaced amps of 1968 where certain circuit changes made them less desirable than the blackfaced amps. This affected some models more than others. For example, the Twin Reverb and Super Reverb combos, along with the Dual Showman Reverb and Bandmaster Reverb \\"piggyback\\" heads were equipped with a master volume control while other models such as the Deluxe Reverb were not altered in any way except for the change in cosmetics. Silverface cosmetics do not necessarily denote silverface circuitry, however. Leo Fender was notorious for tweaking his designs. During the transitional period from late 1967 to mid-1968, the circuit designs of the Twin Reverb and Super Reverb were altered to eliminate an uncommon but serious oscillation in the signal chain. These changes took some months to finalize, as Leo worked through some designs, and happened after the cosmetic changes. Furthermore, the schematic and tube charts that shipped with these models did not always reflect the actual circuitry. Fender had many leftover AB763 (blackface) tube charts left over well into 1969 and shipped these charts with silverface models. Save for a few series (such as HotRod series), a majority of modern Fender amplifiers sports blackface cosmetics. Silverface Silverface Twin Reverb, 1973 Silverface Princeton Fender Silverface amplifiers were built between 1967 and 1981. They are often referred to as Silverface (or Chromeface) because of their brushed aluminum face plate. The first Silverface amps, manufactured between 1967 and 1969, had an aluminum frame (trim, known as a \\"drip edge\\") around the grillcloth, mid-1960s \\"tailed\\" amp logo and the AB763 blackface circuit. An even rarer feature were the vertical, narrow black lines, which separated knob groups in the control panel. This cosmetic detail (later referred to as \\"blackline\\") was quickly abandoned. All of the Silverface amps generally had blue labels on the face plate, but in some rare exceptions (such as the Bronco) the colour was red instead. Some transitional models produced before the \\"tailless\\" period in 1973 featured the AC568 circuit, still retaining the tailed Fender amp decal introduced in 1964. In 1973 CBS changed the \\"tailed\\" Fender amp logo to the modern-looking \\"tailless\\" style (which was first introduced in 1967 on the student Bronco amp). A master volume knob and a pull-out \\"boost\\" pot were added on some amplifiers, followed by ultralinear output transformers and a \\"scripted tailless\\" amp decal (featuring a \\"Made in USA\\" script in the bottom) in 1977; the power was increased between 70 and 135 watts on certain models. All Silverface models usually came with a sparkling silver/blue grillcloth (some later models had a non-standard sparkling silver/orange grillcloth, and a black grillcloth was even fitted to some production runs). The Silverface control face plate was discontinued in 1981 and replaced by the second series of the blackface amps. Fender made a limited-edition Mini-Twin practice amplifier modeled after the mid-70s Twin Reverb models in 1996. The Silverface Edition MT-10 had the authentic look right down to the grillcloth. This 1-watt Twin featured 3 in. speakers, \\"skirted\\" style Fender knobs for Gain, Volume, Tone and Power and included a tilt-back stand. In 2013, Fender released the silverface '68 Custom amplifiers as a part of their Vintage Modified series, modeled after the original drip-edge silverfaced amps of 1968. Models included the Twin Reverb, Deluxe Reverb, and Princeton Reverb, and a Vibrolux Reverb was added to the line the following year. Each amp incorporates reverb and tremolo on both channels. Other features include a Custom channel (which has a modified Bassman tone stack giving modern players greater tonal flexibility with pedals), quicker gain onset and reduced negative feedback for greater touch sensitivity. Early solid-state models Fender's first transistor amplifiers were introduced in 1966. At the time they were the company's \\"flagship\\" range and aimed to make the tube-based designs obsolete. The amplifiers were naturally given traditional Fender model names, earliest including 'Dual Showman', 'Twin Reverb', and 'Bassman'. Other products in the line were the 'Solid-State Reverb Unit' and the 'Solid-State Public-Address System'. 'Super Reverb', 'Pro Reverb', 'Vibrolux Reverb' and 'Deluxe Reverb' amplifiers followed in 1967. The amplifiers were mainly designed by Robert \\"Bob\\" Rissi, Sawa Jacobson and Paul Spranger, who came up with the novel idea of making a heatsink to operate like a chimney to achieve increased and non-restricted airflow. Paul also designed the distinctive angled chassis and overall cosmetic styling. He was granted patents for both accounts. 1966 Vibrolux Reverb In 1969 more transistor amplifiers were introduced, including the 'Zodiac' series and the behemoth 'Super Showman System'. Seth Lover, the legendary designer of the Gibson \\"P.A.F.\\" pickup, and another former Gibson employee, Richard Chauncey Evans, were hired to help in designing the latter series, which consisted of an 'SS-1000' preamplifier head and 'XFL-1000' and 'XFL-2000' self-powered speaker cabinets. The head featured three cascadable channels, a \\"Dimension V\\" oil can delay effect, reverb, vibrato, and a fuzz. The powered cabinets could switch between normal and \\"tube-emulated\\" operation. Zodiac-series amplifiers consisted of 'Capricorn', 'Scorpio', 'Taurus' and 'Libra' models. Aside from being covered with fake alligator skin, they were cosmetically very similar to Super Showman. However, these were smaller combo amplifiers with fewer features and aimed for the lower end of the market. Fender's early transistor amplifiers had an extensive marketing campaign but in the end they proved to be a major disaster. Many key executives of Fender had resigned after the CBS purchase and quality control of the PCB-constructed amps was rather sloppy during the times. Reputedly many of the early solid-state amplifiers failed simply because employees didn't bother to clean up the soldering machines or attach the semiconductors properly to their heat sinks. The infancy of semiconductor technology also meant that many designs failed due to thermal runaway caused by insufficient cooling or lack of knowledge concerning \\"safe\\" power ratings of transistors. The cascaded effects from all this created a very poor reputation for the transistor products and the entire solid-state line was discontinued already in 1971. Additionally the experience also scared Fender away from solid-state amplifier technology for the next ten years. One well known player who took to the Fender Solid State amps was Jan Akkerman who used Super Showman full stacks during the early years of Focus, favouring their clear sound. He used them well into the seventies, often in conjunction with Marshalls to add low end. Second series blackface The Silverface amplifiers were succeeded by a new breed of Fender designs. Fender was now competing with manufacturers who were more in tune with the market; specifically, many guitar players were interested less in \\"cleanish\\" country amp and instead wanted more versatile tone controls and, perhaps more importantly, greater amounts of distortion. This market was dominated by companies such as Marshall and later Mesa Boogie‚Äîboth of which had gotten started modifying Fender amps (the Bassman and the Princeton, respectively). Certain elements of the Blackface cosmetics were reintroduced in the mid-1970s on a series of amplifiers designed by Ed Jahns. The first amplifiers in this new line included the infamous 180W 'Super Twin' and 'Super Twin Reverb' amplifiers which featured active tone controls and a built-in distortion circuit that blended between clean and distorted sounds. Some bass amplifiers with similar architecture were also released, namely the 'Studio Bass' and 'PS300'. These amplifiers didn't yet render obsolete the Silverface series and manufacturing of both co-existed for years. In fact, many Silverface designs were revised to the ultra-linear architecture to step up their output power from 100 watts to 135 watts. Also, existing Silverface Princeton Reverb and Deluxe Reverb circuits were offered in a slightly modified Blackface cosmetic package from roughly 1978 to 1982, the difference from the 1960s versions being that the model designation on the faceplate did not include the word \\"Amp\\" after the script typeface model name, as the earlier versions had. The new Blackfaces came in varying cosmetic styles. All of them had a black control panel and traditional knobs, but they no longer featured the Blackface-style lettering to depict the model name and the traditional control panel layout was partially redesigned. Some of these amplifiers had a silver grillcloth typical to previous BF and SF series amps, but more often the amplifiers sported a black grillcloth. Some amplifiers also had an aluminum trimming running around the grille. The styling didn't become consistent until the early 1980s, at which point all these designs were already discontinued to make way for the very similar looking \\"II Series\\". In the late 1970s and very early 1980s the \\"Supers\\" were followed by the tube- based '30', '75 (Lead)', and '140' tube amps (with reverb and overdrive features) and two solid-state 'Harvard' amps (one with reverb), which were 15W practice amplifiers. Design-wise the tube amplifiers were quite different from their predecessors, as the active tone controls and blending distortion circuit had been removed and the latter feature replaced by a crude version of the channel switching concept. A new feature addition was a crude insert-style effects loop. II Series and the Rivera Era The II Series amplifiers were produced from 1982 until 1986, being the last Fender amps to be made at Fullerton. The specifications for these amplifiers (all 14 of which are listed here), and leadership of the design team, came from Paul Rivera (then marketing director) and are known as Fender Rivera era amplifiers. Some amplifiers in the series used the II moniker; the Champ II, Princeton Reverb II, Deluxe Reverb II and Twin Reverb II, while others such as the Concert and Super Champ did not. Many of these amps had the normal Fender clean sound and in addition a switchable mid voiced gain channel, designed to compete with the Mesa Boogie Mark Series series amps that had gained popularity at the time. The tube amps in the series feature hand-wired eyelet board construction and are also becoming sought-after collectors items, due to the design and build quality. The range included one small tube-driven bass amp, the Bassman 20. There were also some solid-state amplifiers using the II moniker, such as the Harvard Reverb II. Other solid-state amps produced during the Rivera era included the Yale Reverb, Studio Lead, Stage Lead, London Reverb, Montreux, and a solid-state issue of the Showman. Many of these units shared the same circuitry boards in one capacity or another. Red Knob The Red Knob amplifiers were produced from 1987 until 1993. They were made in Lake Oswego, Oregon, at the Sunn factory, a brand/company that Fender had purchased in 1985‚Äì86. These were some of the first models produced by the newly formed Fender Musical Instrument Corporation. Aside from the bright red controls, these amplifiers have a slightly similar appearance to the older Blackface cosmetics, bearing black control panels with white lettering and the late 1970s \\"scripted tailless\\" Fender logo. Many of these models were simply refitted with black knobs and early 1970s \\"unscripted tailless\\" Fender logos in 1996 when most Fender amplifier manufacturing moved to the Ensenada factory in Mexico. This series of amplifiers all used printed circuit board construction. Two utilized the same circuit board and wattage, the Fender Eighty-Five and the Studio 10. They contain the same 65 WRMS circuit, but contain a 12\\" speaker and a 10\\" speaker, respectively. The Fender Eighty-Five was used by Steve Miller (Steve Miller Band) and Jonny Greenwood (Radiohead) on many recordings.  The 21st Century: reissues and modeling In the first fifth of the 21st Century, Fender turned to digital technology to expand its lineup of amplifiers. The first of these, the Cyber Twin and Cyber Deluxe, used circuits within the computer chips to replicate famous amps and effects. The preamp is tube-driven, and the power amp is solid state. Next came the G-DEC (Guitar Digital Entertainment Center), a true modeling amp. It was released in 2007 along with a PC software package to allow it to emulate a wide array of pedals, stompboxes, and amplifiers. The G-Dec won high praise at the time but its effects, based on three-decade-old MIDI technology, were rapidly outdated. An updated G-DEC 3 was released in 2010, followed by the Mustang in 2012. 2014 saw the traditionally-styled Champion amplifier (not to be confused with the classic and reissue Champion/Champ tube amplifiers) released. This amp eschewed the Fuse software in favor of an on-board system, selected by knobs. 2015 saw the release of the Mustang v.2 amplifiers, along with a refresh of the Fuse PC app. In 2017, the Mustang GT series was launched, with Bluetooth capability and wi-fi for over-the-air software updates, with a modernized look and smartphone-enabled functionality through the new Fender Tone app. At the same time, Fender re-released a number of classic amplifiers such as the Bassman and Bandmaster, to high praise both from the music press and the public.

After World War II, he was an information officer in Berlin, Germany as a KGB agent. By 1956, he was a screenwriter in Moscow and still a KGB agent. He was selected as one of the principal agents in the seduction/compromise operation against Maurice Dejean, the French ambassador to the USSR, and his wife. Krotkov was tasked with seducing the wife while various women agents seduced the husband. On 13 September 1963, feeling guilty for the suicide of French military attach√© Louis Guibaud, which was driven by a similar seduction/compromise operation, he defected in London, England.

He wrote I Am From Moscow (1967), The Red Monarch: Scenes From the Life of Stalin (1979), and The Nobel Prize (1980). Wilfred Burchett In November 1969, Krotkov testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security that Wilfred Burchett had been his agent when he worked as a KGB controller. However, he also named, very implausibly, Jean-Paul Sartre and John Kenneth Galbraith as KGB agents, casting a great deal of doubt on his testimony.Ben Kiernan (ed.), Burchett: Reporting the Other Side of the World, 1939‚Äì1983, Quartet Books, London, 1986, p. 296. He claimed that Burchett had proposed a \\"special relationship\\" with the Soviets at their first meeting in Berlin in 1947. Krotkov also reported that Burchett had worked as an agent for both Vietnam and China and was a secret member of the Communist Party of Australia. For his part, Burchett critic Tibor M√©ray alleged that he was an undercover party member but not a KGB agent.Tibor M√©ray, On Burchett, Callistemon Publications, Kallista, Victoria, Australia, 2008, pp. 92‚Äì93, 198, 202-203.

As the newspaper could not afford to pay him a salary, KGB requested an immediate payment of 20,000 rubles and a monthly subsidy of 3000 rubles. Burchett resigned from National Guardian in 1979 when the newspaper took the side of Chinese and Cambodian communists against the Soviet and Vietnamese communists.

It is the second and final novel that she published. The first chapter was originally published as the story \\"You Can't Be Any Poorer Than Dead\\" in the journal New World Writing. The novel tells the story of Francis Marion Tarwater, a fourteen-year-old boy who is trying to escape the destiny his uncle has prescribed for him: the life of a prophet. Like most of O'Connor's stories, the novel is filled with Catholic themes and dark images, making it a classic example of Southern Gothic literature. Plot summary Mason Tarwater, an outspoken evangelist and self-ordained prophet, dies many years after kidnapping his great-nephew Francis, raising him in a backwoods cabin and preparing him to someday take his place as a prophet. Prior to his death, Mason asked the now-teenaged Francis to give him a proper Christian burial with a cross marking the grave so that his body would be resurrected on Judgment Day. Francis starts to dig the grave but suddenly hears a \\"Voice\\" in his head telling him to forget about the old man. Francis obeys and gets drunk instead. When Francis wakes from his drunken sleep, he sets the cabin on fire with his great-uncle's body still inside. He leaves for the city and gets a ride from a salesman, who drops him off at his Uncle Rayber's house. Rayber, a well-educated schoolteacher, is amazed to see young Francis, whom he had long ago given up on after his kidnapping by Mason. Francis is also greeted at the door by Rayber's young son Bishop, who (it is implied) has Down syndrome and low intelligence. Bishop is Rayber's child with Bernice Bishop, a meddlesome social worker whom Mason had referred to as \\"the welfare woman\\". The old man had previously told Francis that Bernice was much older than Rayber and only able to give him one disabled child, and that God had mercy on the child by making him \\"dim-witted\\", which was the only way to protect him from his evil parents. Mason had commissioned Francis to baptize Bishop at some point, in order to save the little boy's soul. Due to this history, Francis is immediately put on edge when confronted with Bishop, but decides to stay with his uncle anyway. Francis does not think of Bishop as a human being and finds him repulsive. The three begin to live together as a family for a while, and Rayber is excited to have his nephew back in order to raise him as a normal boy and provide him with a proper education. However, Francis resists his uncle's attempts at secular reform very much the same way he resisted Mason's attempts at religious reform. Rayber understands what Francis is going through, as he himself had been kidnapped as a child by Mason, but Rayber's father had managed to rescued him. After many attempts by Rayber to \\"civilize\\" the reluctant Tarwater, and many attempts by Tarwater to figure out his true destiny (either as a prophet, which was his great-uncle's wish, or as an enlightened, educated modern man, which is his uncle Rayber's wish), Rayber devises a plan to take Tarwater back to the farm where Tarwater had been raised in the hope that confronting his past will allow him to leave it behind. Under the guise of taking the two boys out to a country lodge to go fishing, Rayber finally confronts Tarwater, telling him that he must accept an ordinary life and ignore the superstitious Christian upbringing and the false destiny with which his great-uncle has corrupted him. Tarwater, however, is not so easily convinced. While at the lodge, he again hears the \\"Voice\\" (the devil) who tells Tarwater to forsake his great-uncle's command to baptize Bishop and to drown the boy instead. One evening, Tarwater takes Bishop out on a boat to the middle of the lake, with Rayber's reluctant blessing. Rayber cannot see them on the lake but can still hear their voices. Tarwater ends up drowning Bishop while at the same time baptizing the boy, thereby fulfilling both destinies simultaneously. Rayber realizes what has happened and faints, not out of fear for his son's life, but because he feels nothing at his son's death. Tarwater runs away into the woods and tries to make his way back to his great-uncle's house to confront his demons once and for all. He eventually hitches a ride with another man, who entices Tarwater to get drunk. Tarwater takes the man's offer and passes out, eventually waking up naked against a tree with his clothes neatly folded beside him. He dresses hurriedly and sets fire to the area. Burning his way through the forest, Tarwater finally makes his way back to Powderhead, his great-uncle's old farm, where he finds the cabin has burned to the ground. Tarwater had assumed that his great-uncle had been burned up with it, but Buford, a black man who lived nearby, had actually rescued old Mason Tarwater's body from the house while Tarwater was drunk at the beginning of the novel, and gave the old man a proper Christian burial just as he had requested. Tarwater realizes that his great-uncle's two main requests (that he be given a proper burial and that Tarwater's nephew Bishop be baptized) have been realized, which convinces Tarwater that he can no longer run away from his calling to be a prophet. The story ends with Tarwater heading toward the city to fulfill his calling to \\"Go warn the children of God of the terrible speed of mercy.\\" Title The novel's title is taken from a verse of the Douay Bible: There are various explanations of the meaning of this verse. The most accepted explanation is that violence constantly attacks God and heaven and that only those who are \\"violent with the love of God\\" can bear heaven away. This is seen when Tarwater drowns Bishop. He commits a violent act, but the \\"accidental\\" baptism is a powerful act of violent love for God‚Äîwhich bears away the crime of murder. Another possible meaning is that both secularism and fundamentalism (that is, the Protestant functioning outside of the Roman Catholic Church) are heresy, which blinds their adherents to God's truth. When God's grace comes into contact with an errant life, a violent revelation occurs. Falsehood and heresy are burnt off, and the sinner then sees the truth clearly. Those who suffer this spiritual violence bear the kingdom of God with them as they go through the world. Characters *Francis Marion Tarwater: The protagonist of the story. Kidnapped by his great-uncle at a young age, he has been raised under the single-minded premise that his destiny is to become a prophet. At first greatly frustrated by the notion of being forced to subscribe to a pre-ordained fate, he vows to do anything he can to prevent it from happening. Francis does not fit the role of a hero, strictly speaking, but is the central figure in the novel. *Rayber: The main antagonist of the story. He is a staunchly anti-religious schoolteacher and lives a secular lifestyle. He is the uncle of Tarwater and the father of Bishop. He tries to protect Tarwater and Bishop from baptism and the old man's corrupting influence, but ultimately fails. *Bishop: An intellectually disabled child who is the son of Rayber and the cousin of Tarwater. Tarwater was raised with the belief that it is his destiny to baptize Bishop, whereas Rayber struggles to prevent this from happening. *Mason Tarwater: The great- uncle of Tarwater and Bishop and the uncle of Rayber. A fanatically religious self-ordained prophet, he raised Tarwater to follow in his footsteps. His death at the beginning of the novel spurs Tarwater's quest of denial and redemption. *The \\"friend\\": A voice in Tarwater's head representing rational, secular thinking, which he has been trained throughout his childhood to ignore. In her letters, O'Connor confirmed that this \\"friend\\" is Satan himself. *The rapist: A passing motorist who offers Tarwater a ride near the end of the novel. It is strongly implied that he rapes and robs Tarwater, an act that ultimately brings Tarwater closer to his destiny. O'Connor also confirmed in her letters that the devil becomes physically \\"actualized in the man who gives Tarwater the lift toward the end.\\" Major themes Flannery O'Connor was a devout Catholic, and The Violent Bear It Away reflects her religious beliefs. It is filled with religious imagery and themes, ranging from the power of passion to the dominance of destiny. The most obvious of the novel's themes is the idea that destiny and religion will dominate over the secular. O'Connor illustrates this well, demonstrating the power of Tarwater's destiny as it dominates every obstacle in its way; the drowning of Bishop is transformed to a baptism, Tarwater's rape turns to revelation, and the secular Rayber fails in every way. The importance of passion is also linked with the power of religion. Tarwater is filled with passion; Rayber suppresses his. Thus, Tarwater succeeds and is redeemed, and Rayber is ultimately destroyed. This is shown when Bishop is killed; when he realizes that he has no love for his son, Rayber collapses. The idea that everything that destroys also creates is evident as well. Nearly every symbol and character in the book pulls Tarwater away from his destiny but also pushes him back. Rayber nearly succeeds in secularizing Tarwater, but he ultimately brings the boy back to Powderhead. The drowning of Bishop, the ultimate secular act, nearly destroys Tarwater's destiny, but the simultaneous baptism redeems it. Fire both destroys Powderhead and burns Tarwater's eyes clean. Water both drowns and baptizes. Everything that destroys, redeems. James Cantrell feels that O'Connor's Irish heritage is central to the novel, serving as the foundation of her exploration of the conflicts between Christ and secularism in America. He says, for example, the surname \\"Tarwater\\" is completely understood only by focusing on Irish culture and history.How Celtic Culture Invented Southern Literature, pp. 209‚Äì225. One possible reading of the novel offers cautionary tale about religious anti-intellectualism. Old Mason Tarwater epitomizes faith coupled with anti-intellectualism and spiritual pride, which brings about the whole series of unfortunate events depicted in the book. Rayber is a basically moral person, but abashed by the closed-minded and anti-intellectual approach to religion that was infused in is childhood draws him towards atheism. Had he actually employed his efforts to find rational reasons for Christian faith, he would find no lack of evidential support, as Christianity has a rich intellectual tradition. Thus Rayber would probably have become a true Christian, himself baptising Bishop, perhaps coming to terms with his fanatical uncle, and educating his nephew both in science and in faith, which are complementary.

At the 2016 census, the locality of Eromanga had a population of 119. However, the town of Eromanga has a population averaging from 30-40. Geography The town lies on the edge of what is called the Eromanga Inland Sea, which existed in the Early Cretaceous. The Eromanga region has abundant oil wells and opal mines. There are also agricultural industries such as cattle and sheep as many pioneering property owners came and took up land in the 1860s. Dinosaur fossils, including Australia's largest dinosaur a titanosaur species of sauropod, have also been found here making it an area of interest for palaeontologists.Another dinosaur found on Qld cattle station ABC News. Retrieved 19 June 2012. It is located on what was Ngandangara territory. Eromanga has been touted as the town in Australia located the farthest from any ocean. However, this claim does not stand up to scrutiny.Ken Blanch, Eromanga's Boast Doesn't Hold Water! , Courier Mail, 9 November 1985. See Pole of inaccessibility for approximations of other locations in Australia that could also make such claims. History The name of the town Eromanga goes back as far as about 1860. The name is thought to have come from an Aboriginal word that means \\"hot gale plain\\" or \\"windy plain\\", though the language and dialect is unknown. But Erromango/Erromanga is also the name of an island in the New Hebrides. Eromanga Post Office opened by October 1902 (a receiving office had been open from 1892). Eromanga Provisional School opened on 5 July 1897 but closed in 1908. In 1910 it reopened as Eromanga State School but closed again on 28 February 1911. The school reopened on 23 October 1917 but closed again. It reopened in 1919 until it closed on 22 March 1936. It reopened on 28 May 1956 and closed again on 11 December 1981. It reopened 29 January 1990. One property which is located in Eromanga which was first written up in 1928 by Keith Pegler, Monler Station, is now in its third generation of farmers. The property, located 11 km south of the town centre, was originally run as a sheep and cattle farm by Keith and has since been passed to Ross Pegler before the current Scott Pegler who runs the station with his family. The property has struggled over the years with natural disasters ranging from drought to flooding, however, the area has received very little rain in its recent history as it has been in it longest drought in history. Education Eromanga State School is a government primary (P-7) school located in Donald Street (). Between 2010 and 2013, the school had between 5 and 6 students enrolled; all students have an individual learning plan. There is one permanent teacher, a teacher aide (partly funded by the community) plus visiting teachers from other schools.  Amenities  The Eromanga branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association has its rooms on the corner of Deacon and Donald Streets. Popular culture Due to its name, the town was referenced in the first episode of Volume 2 in the anime Ninja Nonsense, in episode 18 of Samurai Flamenco, and again in the light novel/anime Eromanga Sensei for its similarity to the term ero manga (literally meaning erotic manga).

Despite its expansion, the company remains privately held.  Beginnings (1932‚Äì1959)  Hilary Fisher Page's Interlocking Building Cubes of 1939 The Lego Group began in the carpentry workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen in Billund, Denmark. In 1916, Christiansen purchased a woodworking shop in Billund, which had been in business since 1895. The shop mostly helped construct houses and furniture and had a small staff of apprentices. The workshop burned down in 1924 when a fire ignited some wood shavings. Ole Kirk constructed a larger workshop and worked towards expanding his business even further. When the Great Depression hit, Ole Kirk had fewer customers and had to focus on smaller projects. He began producing miniature versions of his products as design aids. It was these miniature models of stepladders and ironing boards that inspired him to begin producing toys. On 10 August 1932,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/celebrating-80-years-of- lego-20358245/ Ole Kirk's shop started making wooden toys such as piggy banks, pull toys, cars and trucks, and houses. The business was not profitable because of the Great Depression. Farmers in the area sometimes traded food in exchange for his toys; Ole Kirk continued producing practical furniture in addition to toys to stay in business. In the mid-1930s, the yo-yo toy fad gave him a brief period of increased activity until it suddenly collapsed. To reduce waste, Ole Kirk used the leftover yo-yo parts as wheels for toy trucks. His son Godtfred began working for him, taking an active role in the company. In 1934, Ole Kirk held a contest among his staff to name the company, offering a bottle of homemade wine as a prize. Christiansen was considering two names himself, \\"Legio\\" (with the implication of a \\"Legion of toys\\") and \\"Lego,\\" a self-made contraction from the Danish phrase leg godt, meaning \\"play well.\\" Later the Lego Group discovered that \\"Lego\\" could be loosely interpreted as \\"I put together\\" or \\"I assemble\\" in Latin. Ole Kirk selected Lego, and the company began using it on their products. Following World War II, plastics became available in Denmark, and Lego purchased a plastic injection molding machine in 1947. One of the first modular toys to be produced was a truck that could be taken apart and re-assembled. In 1947, Ole Kirk and Godtfred obtained samples of interlocking plastic bricks produced by the company Kiddicraft. Hilary Fisher Page designed these \\"Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Bricks.\\" In 1939, Page had applied for a patent on hollow plastic cubes with four studs on top (British Patent N¬∫.529,580) that allowed their positioning atop one another without lateral movement. In 1944, Page applied an \\"Improvement to Toy Building Blocks\\" as an addition to the previous patent, in which he describes a building system based on rectangular hollow blocks with 2X4 studs on top enabling the construction of walls with staggered rows and window openings. The addition was granted in 1947 as British Patent N¬∫ 587,206. In 1949, the Lego Group began producing similar bricks, calling them \\"Automatic Binding Bricks.\\" Lego bricks, then manufactured from cellulose acetate, were developed in the spirit of traditional wooden blocks that could be stacked upon one another but could be \\"locked\\" together. They had several round \\"studs\\" on top, and a hollow rectangular bottom. They would stick together, but not so tightly that they could not be pulled apart. In 1953, the bricks were given a new name: Lego Mursten, or \\"Lego Bricks.\\" Plastic products initially were not well received by customers, who preferred wooden or metal toys. Many of Lego's shipments were returned, following poor sales. In 1954, Godtfred had become the junior managing director of the Lego Group. Godtfred's conversation with an overseas buyer struck the idea of a toy \\"system,\\" with many toys in a line of related products. Godtfred evaluated their available products, and saw the plastic bricks as the best candidate for such a \\"system.\\" In 1955, Lego released the \\"Town Plan\\" as such a system, using the building bricks. The building bricks were moderately received but had some problems from a technical standpoint: their \\"locking\\" ability was limited, and they were not versatile. In 1958 the bricks were improved with hollow tubes in the underside of the brick. This change added support in the base, enabling much better locking ability and enhanced versatility. The company patented the new design, as well as several similar designs to avoid competition. Ole Kirk Christiansen died that same year, and Godtfred inherited the leadership of the company.  Change to plastic bricks (1960‚Äì1969)  Lego Duplo bricks Another warehouse fire struck the Lego Group in 1960, consuming most of the company's inventory of wooden toys. Godtfred decided that the plastic line was strong enough to abandon the production of wooden toys. As a result, Godtfred's brothers Gerhardt (then head of wooden toys) and Karl Georg left the Lego company and began a separate company, \\"Bilofix.\\" By the end of the year, the Lego Group was employing more than 450 people. Monday, 21 September 2020 In 1961, Lego wished to expand sales to North America but did not have the logistical capabilities to do so. Lego made an arrangement allowing Samsonite to begin producing and selling Lego products in the United States and Canada. 1961 and 1962 saw the introduction of the first Lego wheels, an addition that expanded the potential for building cars, trucks, buses, and other vehicles from Lego bricks. Also, during this time, the Lego Group introduced toys targeted explicitly towards the pre-school market. In 1964, cellulose acetate, the material used to create Lego bricks, was replaced by the more stable acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS plastic), which is still in use today. ABS is non-toxic, is less prone to discolouration and warping, and is more resistant to heat, acids, salt, and other chemicals. Samsonite manufacturing in North America did not switch at the same time, and still used some degree of cellulose acetate in its Lego products. 1964 was the first year that saw the inclusion of instruction manuals in Lego sets. One of the Lego Group's most successful series, the Lego train system, was released in 1966. The original train sets included a 4.5-volt (which was changed to a 12-volt version two years later) motor, battery box, and rails. On 7 June 1968, the first Legoland Park was opened in Billund. This theme park featured elaborate models of miniature towns built entirely from Lego bricks. The three-acre (12,000 m¬≤) park attracted 625,000 visitors in its first year alone. During the next 20 years, the theme park grew to more than eight times its original size and eventually averaged close to a million paying visitors per year. Sales of Lego sets reached more than eighteen million units in 1968. In 1969, the Duplo system went on sale. Duplo bricks are much larger than Lego bricks, making them safer for young children, but the two systems are compatible: Lego bricks can be fitted neatly onto Duplo bricks, allowing a seamless transition to the Lego system as children outgrow their Duplo bricks. The name Duplo comes from the Latin word duplus, which translates literally as double, meaning that a Duplo brick is exactly twice the dimension of a Lego building brick (2√ó height by 2√ó width by 2√ó depth = 8√ó the volume of a brick).  Expansion (1970‚Äì1991)  During the last three decades of the 20th century, Lego expanded into new areas of toy making and marketing. In 1971, Lego began to target girls by introducing furniture pieces and dollhouses. In 1972, Lego added boat and ship sets, with floating hull pieces. During this same period, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen's son, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, joined the managerial staff, after earning business degrees in Switzerland and Denmark. One of Kjeld's first achievements with the company was the foundation of manufacturing facilities, as well as a research and development department that would be responsible for keeping the company's manufacturing methods up to date. Human figures with posable arms made an appearance in 1974 in \\"Lego family\\" sets, which went on to become the biggest sellers at the time; the next year, an early version of the \\"minifigure\\" miniature Lego person was introduced, but it was not posable and had no face printed on its head. The company opened its first North American Lego production facility in Enfield, Connecticut, in the United States that same year. In 1975, \\"Expert Series\\" sets were introduced, geared towards older, more experienced Lego builders followed by the \\"Expert Builder\\" sets in 1977. The technical sets featured moving parts such as gears, differentials, cogs, levers, axles, and universal joints and permitted the construction of realistic models such as automobiles, with functional rack and pinion steering and lifelike engine movements. In 1978 the Lego \\"minifigure\\" was added. These small Lego people have posable arms and legs, and a smile. The figure was used in many varieties of Lego sets, allowing construction of towns populated with the smiling minifigure Lego citizens. Lego also expanded into space with the creation of Lego Space sets with astronaut minifigures, rockets, lunar rovers, and spaceships, and in the medieval territory with the Castle theme. In 1979, Lego introduced the Scala series, featuring jewelry elements marketed towards young girls. Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen also became the president of Lego that year. Since the 1960s, educators had seen Lego bricks' productive potential as being an invaluable asset in helping children to develop creativity and problem-solving abilities. Teachers had been using Lego bricks in the classroom for a variety of reasons. In 1980, the Lego Group established the Educational Products Department (eventually renamed Lego Dacta, in 1989), to expand the educational possibilities of their toys. A packing and assembly factory opened in Switzerland, followed by another in Jutland, Denmark, that manufactured Lego tires. Between the 1960s and '90s, Lego worked with Royal Dutch Shell in allowing Shell branding on certain items. In 1981, the second generation of Lego trains appeared. As before, these were available in either 4.5 V (battery-powered) or 12 V (mains powered), but with a much wider variety of accessories, including working lights, remote-controlled points and signals, and decouplers. The \\"Expert Builder\\" series matured in 1982, becoming the \\"Technic\\" series. 13 August of that year marked the Lego Group's 50th anniversary; the book 50 Years of Play was published to commemorate the occasion. In the following year, the Duplo system was expanded to include sets for even younger audiences, particularly infants; new sets included baby rattles and figures with movable limbs. The year after, Lego minifigure citizens gained a realm of knights and horses, with a redesign of the Castle theme. Light & Sound sets made their appearance in 1985; these sets included a battery pack with electrical lights, buzzers, and other accessories to add another dimension of realism to Lego creations. Also that year, the Lego Group's educational division produced the Technic Computer Control, which was an educational system whereby Technic robots, trucks, and other motorized models could be controlled with a computer. Manaus, Brazil gained a Lego factory in this year, as well. In 1984, the Technic line was expanded with the addition of pneumatic components. This Lego model of a composite of London, including a motorized model of a London Underground train controlled by computers, can be seen in Legoland Windsor. In August 1988, 38 children from 17 different countries took part in the first Lego World Cup building contest, held in Billund. That same year, Lego Canada was established. The Lego line grew again in 1989 with the release of the Lego Pirates theme, which featured a variety of pirate ships, deserted islands, and treasure. The Lego Group's Educational Products Department was renamed Lego Dakta in this year; the name comes from the Greek word \\"didactic,\\" which roughly means \\"the study of the learning process.\\" MIT's Dr. Seymour Papert, from the Laboratory of Computer Learning, was named \\"Lego Professor of Learning Research,\\" after his ongoing work in linking the Logo programming language with Lego products. Until 1989, Lego minifigures only came in yellow-skin color with a standard smiling face, though early prototypes had a variety of skin colors and facial expressions. That year the Lego Group expanded the array of facial expressions (adding them around the standard face of two eyes and smile), with beards and eye patches, sunglasses, lipstick, and eyelashes, mostly for the minifigures in the newly launched Lego Pirates theme, and occasionally Lego Castle, Lego City, and Lego Space. Some older collectors resented the new facial expressions, saying they looked too \\"cartoon-ish\\" or \\"kiddy,\\" and preferred the simplistic nature of the two eyes and smile. Particularly for Lego Pirates, these more complicated faces, in combination with the torso, headgear (either a helmet or hair), and accessories, allowed for the creation of specific characters and an accompanying backstory. In 1990, Lego released a new series designed for advanced builders. Three Model Team sets, including a race car and an off-road vehicle, featured a level of detail and realism not previously seen in any Lego series. Where Technic was mechanically accurate, Model Team was visually and stylistically accurate. The Lego Group became one of the top 10 toy companies that year; it was the only toy company in Europe to be among the top 10. Also that year, Legoland Billund reached more than one million visitors for the first time in its history. The first-ever \\"Lego Professor of Business Dynamics,\\" Xavier Gilbert, was appointed to an endowed chair at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland. Lego Malaysia was also established in 1990. In 1991, the Lego Group standardized its electrical components and systems; the Trains and Technic motors were made 9V to bring the systems into line with the rest of the Lego range. In 1992, two Guinness records were set using Lego products: A castle made from 400,000 Lego bricks, and measuring 4.45 meters by 5.22 meters, was built on Swedish television, and a 545 meters long Lego railway line with three locomotives was constructed. Duplo was augmented with the addition of the Toolo line featuring a screwdriver, wrench, nuts, and bolts; the Paradisa line, targeted towards girls, brought a variety of new pastel colors into the Lego system and focused around horses and a beach theme. In 1993 a Duplo train and a parrot-shaped \\"brickvac\\" that could scoop Lego pieces up off the floor were released. A model of St Paul's Cathedral in London can be seen in Legoland Windsor. It is made of thousands of Lego bricks. The rotating model of the London Eye in the background is also made of Lego bricks. In the late 1990s, the Lego Group brought out a series of new and specialized ranges aimed at particular demographics. The Slizers/Throwbots line preceded the Bionicle range and uses Technic pieces and specialist moldings to create a set of action figures for boys, while Belville is a more conventional line aimed at girls and featuring large posable figures like those in the Technic range. A \\"Lego 4 Juniors\\" group features tall medium-sized figures (\\"medi-figure\\") without jointed arms, and longer legs than the classic Lego minifigure. In 2003, the Lego Group introduced a completely new system, Clikits, aimed at girls and consisting of customizable plastic jewelry and accessories. In 2004, Lego added the QUATRO brick, for ages 1‚Äì3. Much like Duplo, a Quatro brick is four times the dimension of a regular Lego brick and is compatible with the Duplo brick. Also that year, they created the second line of Knights Kingdom themed product.  Decline (1992‚Äì2004)  Lego's profits had declined since 1992. Around 1995 or 1996, according to designer Mark Stafford, the Lego Group retired many LEGO Designers who had created the sets from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, replacing them with 30 'innovators' who graduated from the European design colleges around Europe who knew \\"little specifically about toy design and less about LEGO building\\". At the time, sets could take over a year to progress from the design stage to store shelves. By 1997, there was a resultant change in the design direction of products, as set details were sacrificed for decreased building times (with fewer pieces) and increased playability features, but this shift drew mixed reception from hardcore Lego fans used to the meticulous construction required of \\"classic era\\" sets of the 1980s to mid-1990s. Lego Pirates, which had a strong run since its launch in 1989, was promptly killed off, with 1997 being its last year of production. This change in design teams only served to accelerate the company's decline. In 1998, Lego posted its first-ever loss, at ¬£23 million. In the same year, the company laid off 1,000 employees. In 1999, the first Lego products featuring licensed intellectual property, i.e., not designed in-house, were Lego Star Wars and Winnie the Pooh Duplo, followed in 2000 by Lego Harry Potter characters to figures from Steven Spielberg movies. Soren Holm, the head of Lego Concept Lab, said toy weapons had always been heavily debated, but that since the Lego Star Wars release, Lego has grown \\"more comfortable with conflict.\\" Mr. Laursen, executive North American operations suggested to make \\"violence not explicit, but humoristic.\\" Licensed properties did provide a short-term boost to profits during the release of blockbuster movies, however sales would taper off after public excitement died down. Furthermore the added cost of the license resulted in such sets being more expensive which alienated long-time fans, who also bemoaned the declining quality and reduced availability of comparable sets not based on licensing. After 1999, many in- house characters were strongly characterised with media utilisation and non- Lego System merchandising, most notably Bionicle from 2001‚Äì2010 and then again in 2016. In 2002, Duplo was merged with Lego Baby into the new label Lego Explore. In 2003, following the inclusion of Lando Calrissian in a Star Wars set, as well as the Basketball theme featuring the likenesses of actual players, it was decided that minifigs based on real persons and live-action franchises would have natural skin-tones. In 2004, Lego posted a loss of ¬£174 million, with the executive vice-president of marketing Mads Nipper later describing the company as having been \\"almost bankrupt\\" at this point. He analysed in retrospect that \\"we continued to invest as if the company were growing strongly. We failed to realise that we were on a slippery path‚Ä¶ Children were getting less and less time to play. Some of the western markets had fewer and fewer children. So play trends changed, and we failed to change. We were not making toys that were sufficiently interesting to children. We failed to innovate enough. And we had nowhere cut deep enough to right-size the company\\". In 2004, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen resigned as CEO and appointed J√∏rgen Vig Knudstorp, the first non-family CEO. The company sold the four Legoland parks to theme-park operators Merlin Entertainments, and manufacturing, 80% of which had been outsourced, was returned to Lego's control.  Recovery (2005‚Äìpresent)  A presenter at Bricks Cascade, a Lego convention in Portland, Oregon, in March 2018. The company focused on its core products and reintroduced the Duplo label in late 2004. Since 2004, manufacturing had been moved to Mexico and distribution relocated from Billund to the Czech Republic. By 2007 a global workforce of 9,100 in 1998 was reduced to 4,200 due to outsourcing. In the US alone, Lego sales increased 32 percent because of Star Wars and Indiana Jones themed games, while globally 2008 sales increased 18.7 percent. Mr. Laursen, Lego executive of North American operations, said in 2009 that licenses played a more prominent role in the American market than overseas. About 60 percent of Lego's American sales were estimated to be linked to licenses, twice that of 2004. Laursen stated in 2009 that Lego was \\"definitely more commercially oriented\\". In 2009, both Lego Games (board games) and Lego Power Miners were introduced; despite the Great Recession profits for 2009 were ¬£99.5 million, with Mads Nipper, Lego executive vice-president of marketing stating to be \\"delivering twice the return on sales of any competitor.\\" In 2011, Lego started new theme called Lego Ninjago, which became worldwide popular theme, also in 2011 resumed a long-term contract with Royal Dutch Shell, after using its logo on products from the 1960s through to the 1990s. Greenpeace criticized this co-branding in 2014. In 2012, an animated short film titled The Lego Story made by Danish studio Lani Pixels for the 80th anniversary of Lego, depicted the struggles of Ole Kirk Christiansen and his son Godtfred Kirk Christiansen from 1932‚Äì1968, as they worked to make the company successful. In 2014, Warner Bros and The Lego Group released The Lego Movie, a computer-animated adventure comedy film telling the story of an ordinary Lego Minifigure prophesied to save the world. It received one of the highest recorded openings for an original animated movie, and the Los Angeles Times noted \\"nearly unanimous positive reviews\\" for the film. In 2015, the Lego firm sparked controversy when it refused a bulk order to Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, who is openly critical of the Chinese Communist government. Ai had previously used Lego bricks to build portraits of world political activists. Lego said it would not sell directly to users with \\"political intentions.\\" An opinion piece in the Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times praised Lego for its \\"good business sense\\" while the decision drew condemnation online. Lego fans offered to donate Lego bricks to Ai Weiwei instead. In 2017, Warner Bros, DC Entertainment, and The Lego Group released The Lego Batman Movie as a spinoff based on one of the lead characters of Lego's first animated movie. Lego has since released another animated film based on one of its toy lines, Ninjago, entitled The Lego Ninjago Movie in 2017. In the first half of 2017, Lego saw its first revenue decline in 13 years, announcing plans in September 2017 to cut 1,400 jobs. In February 2019, a sequel to The Lego Movie was produced by Warner Animation Group and released by Warner Bros., titled The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. Many of the voice actors from the first film reprised their characters for the sequel, but it underperformed in ticket sales compared to its predecessors. On 25 November 2019, The Lego Group announced the acquisition of Bricklink, the world's largest Lego fan community from Nexon, for an unknown price, which is expected to finish before the end of 2019.

It is situated on the sheltered Horseshoe Bay, a small bay off the much larger Encounter Bay. Pullen Island lies outside the mouth of the bay. At the , Port Elliot had a population of 1,754, although this section of the coast is now built up almost all the way from Goolwa to Victor Harbor.  History  Horseshoe Bay was proclaimed a port in 1851, and the settlement above the bay was named Port Elliot in 1852 after Charles Elliot, the Governor of Bermuda who was a friend of the then Governor of South Australia, Sir Henry Young. The location had been previously known as Freeman's Knob; the aboriginal name for the area may have been \\"Witengangool\\". Freemans Nob was used as a lookout post for shore-base bay whaling stations in Encounter Bay in the late 1830s. The area was also used as a place to launch boats in 1842 for Hargan and Hart‚Äôs whaling station at Rosetta Head. The port was established to provide a safe seaport for the Murray river trade which terminated at Goolwa as the Murray Mouth was deemed too treacherous and unpredictable for safe navigation. Goods and passengers were carried between Goolwa and Port Elliot on the first public railway in Australia completed in 1854.The Centenary of the Goolwa ‚Äì Port Elliot Line Strempel, A.A. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, May, 1954 pp49-62 The government works to establish the port included Australia's first reticulated water supply, from wells at Waterport (about 1 km north of the bay) to tanks above the jetty which provided fresh water for ships as well as for the town. In 1864 after a number of disastrous shipping losses in Horseshoe Bay the railway was extended to Victor Harbor which provided safer access for ships. Port Elliot's role as a port ended, with the bay and jetty being left to the fishermen and beachgoers. The importance of the rail link between the river and the sea soon also ended with the building of a railway between Adelaide and Morgan which enabled river traffic to offload freight and passengers over further upstream and rail them directly to Adelaide. The towns of the southern Fleurieu coast ‚Äì Victor Harbor, Port Elliot, Middleton and Goolwa ‚Äì were spared any further commercial or industrial development, and became a popular holiday destination with many guest houses, camping parks and 'weekender' houses and shacks. The nearby early subdivisions of Waterport, Louisville, Findon, Ville St.Louis and Elliot Town are now all considered part of Port Elliot.  Recent times  Today, Port Elliot is a quiet township with two hotels, three churches, six coffee shops, no fast food chains, and is a popular holiday destination close enough to Adelaide for day trippers and even commuters. The continuing expansion of the Greater Adelaide metropolitan area together with ongoing improvements to the road links between the Fleurieu Peninsula and Adelaide has brought an influx of \\"seachange retirees\\", driving up house and land prices, and adversely affecting the ability of local young people and families to remain in the area. Employment prospects are largely limited to hospitality work, aged care and the building trades which continue to benefit from rapid growth in the region. In 2007, Port Elliot became the focus of unwanted media attention due to the murder of 15-year-old Carly Ryan at Lady Bay. On 21 January 2010, a 50-year-old man from Victoria was found guilty of the murder while his son was found not guilty.  Little penguin colony  Little penguins once bred at Freeman's Knob. In 1981 a dog attack left at least 10 adult penguins dead and numerous eggs broken and empty. It was posited that this event may have rendered the colony extinct.

Guest was launched 20 February 1942 by the Boston Naval Shipyard; sponsored by Mrs. Ann Guest Walsh, granddaughter of Com. Guest; commissioned 15 December 1942, Commander Henry Crommelin in command. Guest decommissioned in 1946 and was transferred on loan to the Brazilian Navy in 1959, where she served as Par√° (D27). She was stricken in 1979 and was sunk as a target ship in 1983. 1943 After shakedown training at Guantanamo Bay, Guest made a cruise to Trinidad with aircraft carrier Independence (CVL-22). This was followed by a convoy escort voyage from New York to Casablanca and return to Boston (28 April - 31 May 1943). She departed Boston 20 July for brief training in Hawaiian waters, then joined the 3rd Fleet 28 August at Efate, New Hebrides Islands. After an offensive sweep to the Santa Cruz Islands and several escort missions to Noum√©a, New Caledonia, she departed Efate 28 October for invasion of Bougainville. She guarded transports during the initial landings 1 November assisting in shooting down two enemy bombers. In the following months she escorted troop and logistic convoys from Guadalcanal to Cape Torokina, twice driving off bombers and torpedo planes which attacked her convoy. She silenced Japanese coastal defense guns at Motupene Point, Bougainville, 4 December 1943, and bombarded the Saba River area 25 January 1944. 1944 Guest protected transports landing the Marine Raiders on Green Island 31 January 1944. As the Raiders reembarked the next morning, she made two depth charge attacks on a diving submarine. Hudson (DD-475) followed up this attack to complete the kill of the 1,400-ton Japanese submarine I-171. Guest again screened transports during invasion of the Green Islands 15 February 1944. She bombarded Kavieng, New Ireland 25 February, and the Sanba River area on Bougainville 17 March. She rescued the crew of PT-63 on the latter date. In a case of mistaken identity on 17 March motor torpedo boat PT-283 was sunk by friendly fire from destroyer Guest (DD-472), in the Solomons, near Choseul Island. Her 5-inch gunfire destroyed the grounded Japanese freighter Meisyo Maru 30 April to the east of Nemto Island. After amphibious assault training in the New Hebrides, she departed from Roi, in the Marshall Islands, 10 June 1944 for the invasion and capture of the Mariana Islands. Guest poured gunfire ahead of troops landing on Saipan 15 June 1944, then helped repel four massive air raids against Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. She also conducted pre-invasion bombardment of Guam and gave direct gunfire support to the landings on Guam 21 July 1944. She remained on bombardment support and patrol stations until 9 August, then sailed for amphibious warfare exercises in the Solomons. Guest departed Purvis Bay, Solomon Islands, 6 September 1944. A unit of Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf's Western Fire Support group, she bombarded Anguar in the Palau Islands 12 September 1944. The following day she rescued 7 officers and 45 men of destroyer Perry (DMS-17), which hit a mine and sank off Anguar. Guest departed the area 25 September and entered San Francisco Bay 25 October 1944 for overhaul. 1945 Overhaul was followed by training in Hawaiian waters until 27 January 1945 when she departed with a task group bound via the Marianas for Iwo Jima. Her 5-inch guns blasted that island during the initial invasion 19 February 1945. She continued gunfire support until 28 February when she sailed to join the screen of escort carriers in San Pedro Bay, Philippine Islands. Guest departed San Pedro Bay 27 March to guard escort carriers giving direct support to the invasion of Okinawa. Detached 9 May, she was assigned to antiaircraft defense station in the Okinawas western transport area. The night of 25 May a kamikaze suicide plane glanced off her mast and crashed alongside to portside, causing damage to the stack. She remained on antiaircraft defense station until 1 July 1945. She was then routed via Ulithi and the Marshalls in the screen of escort carriers bound to Adak, Alaska, thence to Ominato, Japan. After plane guard duty with carriers along the coast of Honsh≈´, she returned via Adak to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard 15 November 1945. Guest decommissioned at San Diego 4 June 1946 and remained in reserve until transferred 5 June 1959 on loan to the government of Brazil. Brazilian service The ship served in the Brazilian Navy as Par√° (D27). She was stricken in 1979. After decommissioning she was used during 1982 and 1983 as a target ship for gunnery and torpedo practice and for Exocet MM 38 anti-ship missiles launched by the Brazilian frigate Niter√≥i (F 40). On 23 February 1983, she was sunk by two torpedoes fired by the Brazilian submarine Cear√° (S 14) in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Brazil approximately 80 nautical miles (148 km) south of Cabo Frio lighthouse.navsource.org USS GUEST (DD-472) Honors Guest received eight battle stars for service in World War II.

Co-written by Trier and Niels V√∏rsel, the film focuses on the screenwriting process. V√∏rsel and Trier play themselves, coming up with a last-minute script for a producer. The story is inter-cut with scenes from the film they write, in which Trier plays a renegade doctor trying to cure a modern-day epidemic. The film marks the first in a series of collaborations between Trier and Udo Kier. Plot The film is divided into five days. On the first day the protagonists, screenwriters Lars and Niels lose the only copy of a film script (Kommis√¶ren Og Luderen, \\"The Policeman and the Whore\\", a reference to The Element of Crime). They begin to write a new script about an epidemic: the outbreak of a plague-like disease. The protagonist is a doctor, Mesmer, who, against the will of the Faculty of Medicine of an unknown city, goes to the countryside to help people. During the next days, the facts of the script join the real-life events in which a similar disease starts to spread. Lars and Niels go to Germany, where they meet a man who describes the Allied bombing of Cologne during the Second World War. After the trip, Niels goes to a hospital where he undergoes a minor surgical procedure and while there tells Lars to go to see Palle, a pathologist who is performing an autopsy on a man who has recently died of an unknown disease. The last day, Lars and Niels have a dinner with their producer, to whom they reveal the end of the film, that Mesmer and his medical kit have spread the disease. The producer doesn't like the short twelve-page script, which has no violence, few deaths, and no subplots (which are common in Danish cinema). After that a hypnotist and a woman arrive in the house, to \\"help\\" writing the script, but the woman is overpowered by the visions of the script which are becoming real. She commits suicide, then another woman who shares the house with Lars and Niels dies too, and Niels begins showing the signs of the disease.

It was nominated for Best Film at the Fantasporto International Fantasy Film Festival in 1988. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 33%, based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 66 out of 100, based on 4 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 out of 4, and wrote \\"Will never be confused with von Trier's great films. But it is an intriguing introduction to his later cinematic obsessions.\\" The Village Voice called the film \\"among [Lars von Trier's] better and most revealing movies\\".

Eurovision was set up for the purpose of exchanging TV programmes and, subsequently, TV news footage (via the daily Eurovision news exchange - EVN). The first official Eurovision transmission took place on 6 June 1954. It has a radio counterpart, Euroradio, within that same European Broadcasting Union. Background The name \\"Eurovision\\" was originally coined by British journalist George Campey when writing for the Evening Standard, and was adopted by the EBU for its network. The first official Eurovision transmission took place on 6 June 1954. It showed the Narcissus Festival in Montreux, Switzerland followed by an evening program from Rome, including a tour of the Vatican, an address from Pope Pius XII and an apostolic blessing.http://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/dossiers_1_04_eurovision50_ve_tcm6-13890.pdf Eurovision is managed by the European Broadcasting Union‚Äôs Eurovision Operations Department and offers permanent coverage of Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, North Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as ad-hoc coverage of the African continent and the Pacific Rim.

History =Dynastic period= There are conflicting theories regarding whether Buddhism first reached Vietnam during the 3rd or 2nd century BCE via delegations from India, or during the 1st or 2nd century from China.Nguyen Tai Thu. The History of Buddhism in Vietnam. 2008. In either case, by the end of the second century CE, Vietnam had developed into a major regional Mahayana Buddhist center centering on Luy L√¢u in modern B·∫Øc Ninh Province, northeast of the present day capital city of Hanoi. Luy L√¢u was the capital of the Han region of Jiaozhi and was a popular place visited by many Indian Buddhist missionary monks en route to China. The monks followed the maritime trade route from the Indian sub-continent to China used by Indian traders. A number of Mahayana sutras and the ƒÅgamas were translated into Classical Chinese there, including the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters and the Anapanasati. Jiaozhi was the birthplace of Buddhist missionary Kang Senghui who was of Sogdian origin. Over the next eighteen centuries, Vietnam and China shared many common features of cultural, philosophical and religious heritage. This was due to geographical proximity to one another and Vietnam being annexed twice by China. Vietnamese Buddhism is thus related to Chinese Buddhism in general, and to some extent reflects the formation of Chinese Buddhism after the Song dynasty.Prebish, Charles. Tanaka, Kenneth. The Faces of Buddhism in America. 1998. p. 134 Theravada Buddhism, on the other hand, would become incorporated through the southern annexation of Khmer people and territories. During the ƒêinh dynasty (968‚Äì980), Buddhism was recognized by the state as an official faith (~971), reflecting the high esteem of Buddhist faith held by the Vietnamese monarchs.Nguyen Tai Thu 2008, pg 77. The Early L√™ dynasty (980‚Äì1009) also afforded the same recognition to the Buddhist church. The growth of Buddhism during this time is attributed to the recruitment of erudite monks to the court as the newly independent state needed an ideological basis on which to build a country. Subsequently, this role was ceded to Confucianism.Nguyen Tai Thu 2008, pg 75. Vietnamese Buddhism reached its zenith during the L√Ω dynasty (1009‚Äì1225) beginning with the founder L√Ω Th√°i T·ªï, who was raised in a pagoda.Nguyen Tai Tu Nguyen 2008, pg 89. All of the kings during the L√Ω dynasty professed and sanctioned Buddhism as the state religion. This endured with the Tr·∫ßn dynasty (1225‚Äì1400) but Buddhism had to share the stage with the emerging growth of Confucianism. By the 15th century, Buddhism fell out of favor with the court during the Later L√™ dynasty, although still popular with the masses. Officials like L√™ Qu√°t attacked it as heretical and wasteful.Vi·ªát Nam: Borderless Histories ‚Äì Page 67 Nhung Tuyet Tran, Anthony Reid ‚Äì 2006 \\"In this first formal attack in 1370, a Confucian official named L√™ Qu√°t attempted, without much success, to brand Buddhism as heretical and to promote Confucianism.

In May 1963, in the central city of Hu·∫ø, where Di·ªám's elder brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c was the archbishop, Buddhists were prohibited from displaying Buddhist flags during Vesak celebrationsTopmiller, p. 2. yet few days earlier, Catholics were allowed to fly religious flags at a celebration in honour of the newly seated archbishop. This led to widespread protest against the government; troops were sent in and nine civilians were killed in the confrontations. This led to mass rallies against Di·ªám's government, termed as the Buddhist crisis. The conflicts culminated in Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c's self-immolation. President Di·ªám's younger brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu favored strong-armed tactics and Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces engaged in the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda raids, killing estimated hundreds. Dismayed by the public outrage, the US government withdrew support for the regime. President Di·ªám was deposed and killed in the 1963 coup.Karnow, pp. 295‚Äì325.Moyar, pp. 212‚Äì250. Political strength of the Buddhists grew in the 1960s as the different schools and orders convene to form the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. Leaders of the Church like Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang had considerable sway in national politics, at times challenging the government. With the fall of Saigon in 1975, the whole nation came under Communist rule; many religious practices including Buddhism were discouraged. In the North the government had created the United Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam, co-opting the clergy to function under government auspices but in the South, the Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam still held sway and openly challenged the communist government. The Sangha leadership was thus arrested and imprisoned; Sangha properties were seized and the Sangha itself was outlawed. In its place was the newly created Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam, designed as the final union of all Buddhist organizations, now under full state control. =Modern period= The treatment of Buddhists started to ease since ƒê·ªïi m·ªõi in 1986. Since ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi (1986) many reforms have allowed Buddhism to be practiced relatively unhindered by the individuals. However no organized sangha is allowed to function independent of the state. It was not until 2007 that Pure Land Buddhism, the most widespread type of Buddhism practiced in Vietnam, was officially recognized as a religion by the government.\\"Pure Land Buddhism recognised by Gov‚Äôt.\\" Viet Nam News. December 27, 2007. Accessed: April 7, 2009. Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô the Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Sangha, once imprisoned, remains under surveillance and restricted in his travels. Today, Buddhists are found throughout Vietnam, from North to South. Buddhism is the single largest organized religion in Vietnam, with somewhere between 12.2% and 16.4% of the population identifying themselves as Buddhist.The Global Religious Landscape 2010.

Quoting United Nations' \\"Press Statement on the visit to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief\\". Hanoi, Viet Nam 31 July 2014. Vietnamese. Quote, p. 8: \\"[...] According to the official statistics presented by the Government, the overall number of followers of recognized religions is about 24 million out of a population of almost 90 million. Formally recognized religious communities include 11 million Buddhists [...]\\" Some argued the number to be higher than reported, as many declared themselves as atheists, but still participated in Buddhist activities. On one hand, though the Communist Party of Vietnam officially promotes atheism, it has usually leaned in favor of Buddhism, as Buddhism is associated with the long and deep history of Vietnam, and also, there have rarely been disputes between Buddhists and the Government;https://kyotoreview.org/issue-19/buddhist-studies-vietnam/ the Communist Government also sees Buddhism as a symbol of Vietnamese patriotism. Buddhist festivals are officially promoted by the Government and restrictions are few,http://www.vietnam-culture.com/vietnam-religion-buddhism.aspx in contrast to its Christian, Muslim and other religious counterparts. Recently, the Communist regime in Vietnam allowed major Buddhist figures to enter the country. Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh, a major Buddhist figure revered both in Vietnam and worldwide, is among these.https://charterforcompassion.org/practicing- peace/inner-peace-quotes-from-zen-buddhist-master-thich-nh-t-h-nh In order to distance itself from the fellow communist neighbor China, the Government of Vietnam allows the publishing of books and stories of 14th Dalai Lama, who has a personal friendship with Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh and were commonly critical of the Chinese regime after the 2008 Tibetan unrest,https://plumvillage.org/letters- from-thay/thich-nhat-hanh-on-tibet-27-march-2008/ which was seen as an attempt to antagonize the Chinese Government and China as a whole as Beijing considers the Dalai Lama to be a terrorist. =Overseas= Buddhist Monastery of Tam Bao Son, Harrington, Quebec, Canada After the fall of South Vietnam to communism in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War, the first major Buddhist community appeared in North America. Since this time, the North American Vietnamese Buddhist community has grown to some 160 temples and centers. Proselytizing is not a priority. The most famous practitioner of synchronized Vietnamese Thi·ªÅn in the West is Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh who has authored dozens of books and founded the Plum Village Monastery in France together with his colleague, bhik·π£u·πáƒ´ and Zen Master Ch√¢n Kh√¥ng. According to Nguyen and Barber, Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh's fame in the Western world as a proponent of engaged Buddhism and a new Thi·ªÅn style has \\"no affinity with or any foundation in traditional Vietnamese Buddhist practices\\"Cuong Tu Nguyen & A. W. Barber 1998, p. 131. and according to Alexander Soucy (2007) his style of Zen Buddhism is not reflective of actual Vietnamese Buddhism. Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh often recounts about his early Thi·ªÅn practices in Vietnam in his Dharma talks saying that he continued and developed this practice in the West which has a distinctive Vietnamese Thi·ªÅn flavor. Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh's Buddhist teachings have started to return to a Vietnam where the Buddhist landscape is now being shaped by the combined Vietnamese and Westernized Buddhism that is focused more on the meditative practices. Practice Vietnamese art of the pure land of K·π£itigarbha. Followers in Vietnam practice differing traditions without any problem or sense of contradiction.Cuong Tu Nguyen & A. W. Barber 1998, pg 135. Few Vietnamese Buddhists would identify themselves as a particular kind of Buddhism, as a Christian might identify him or herself by a denomination, for example. Although Vietnamese Buddhism does not have a strong centralized structure, the practice is similar throughout the country at almost any temple. Gaining merit is the most common and essential practice in Vietnamese Buddhism with a belief that liberation takes place with the help of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Buddhist monks commonly chant sutras, recite Buddhas‚Äô names (particularly AmitƒÅbha), doing repentance and praying for rebirth in the Pure Land.Cuong Tu Nguyen & A. W. Barber 1998, pg 134. The Lotus Sutra and the Amitabha Sutra are the most commonly used sutras.Cuong Tu Nguyen & A. W. Barber 1998, pg 134 . Most sutras and texts are in Classical Chinese and are merely recited with Sino-Xenic pronunciations, making them incomprehensible to most practitioners. Three services are practiced regularly at dawn, noon, and dusk. They include sutra reading with ni·ªám Ph·∫≠t and dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ recitation and kinh h√†nh (walking meditation). Laypeople at times join the services at the temple and some devout Buddhist practice the services at home. Special services such as Sam Nguyen/Sam Hoi (confession/repentance) takes place on the full moon and new moon each month. Ni·ªám Ph·∫≠t practice is one way of repenting and purifying bad karma. Buddhist temples also serve a significant role in death rituals and funerals among overseas Vietnamese. Branches =MahƒÅyƒÅna traditions= B√°i ƒê√≠nh Temple in Ninh B√¨nh Province Monks holding a service in Hu·∫ø The overall doctrinal position of Vietnamese Buddhism is the inclusive system of Tiantai, with the higher metaphysics informed by the Huayan school (); however, the orientation of Vietnamese Buddhism is syncretic without making such distinctions. Therefore, modern practice of Vietnamese Buddhism can be very eclectic, including elements from Thi·ªÅn (Chan Buddhism), Thi√™n Thai (Tiantai), T·ªãnh ƒë·ªô Pure Land Buddhism, and popular practices from M·∫≠t T√¥ng (Vajrayana). Vietnamese Buddhist are often separated not by sects but by the style in how they perform and recite texts, which monks of different regions of Vietnam are known for. According to Charles Prebish, many English language sources contain misconceptions regarding the variety of doctrines and practices in traditional Vietnamese Buddhism:Prebish, Charles. Tanaka, Kenneth. The Faces of Buddhism in America. 1998. p. 135 The methods of Pure Land Buddhism are perhaps the most widespread within Vietnam. It is common for practitioners to recite sutras, chants and dhƒÅra·πáƒ´s looking to gain protection through bodhisattvas or dharmapalas.Cuong Tu Nguyen 1997, p. 94. It is a devotional practice where those practicing put their faith in AmitƒÅbha (). Followers believe they will gain rebirth in his pure land by chanting Amitabha's name. A pure land is a Buddha-realm where one can more easily attain enlightenment since suffering does not exist there. Many religious organizations have not been recognized by the government; however, in 2007, with 1.5 million followers, the Vietnamese Pure Land Buddhism Association (T·ªãnh ƒê·ªô C∆∞ Sƒ© Ph·∫≠t H·ªôi Vi·ªát Nam) received official recognition as an independent and legal religious organization. Thi·ªÅn is the Sino-Xenic pronunciation of Chan (Japanese Zen) and is derived ultimately from Sanskrit \\"dhyƒÅna\\". The traditional account is that in 580, an Indian monk named Vinitaruci () traveled to Vietnam after completing his studies with Sengcan, the third patriarch of Chan Buddhism. This would be the first appearance of Thi·ªÅn. The sect that Vinitaruci and his lone Vietnamese disciple founded would become known as the oldest branch of Thi·ªÅn. After a period of obscurity, the Vinitaruci School became one of the most influential Buddhist groups in Vietnam by the 10th century, particularly under the patriarch V·∫°n-H·∫°nh (died 1018). Other early Vietnamese Zen schools included the V√¥ Ng√¥n Th√¥ng, which was associated with the teaching of Mazu Daoyi, and the Th·∫£o ƒê∆∞·ªùng, which incorporated nianfo chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks. A new Thi·ªÅn school was founded by King Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng (1258‚Äì1308); called the Tr√∫c L√¢m \\"Bamboo Grove\\" school, it evinced a deep influence from Confucian and Taoist philosophy. Nevertheless, Tr√∫c L√¢m's prestige waned over the following centuries as Confucianism became dominant in the royal court. In the 17th century, a group of Chinese monks led by Nguy√™n Thi·ªÅu introduced the Ling school (L√¢m T·∫ø). A more native offshoot of L√¢m T·∫ø, the Li·ªÖu Qu√°n school, was founded in the 18th century and has since been the predominant branch of Vietnamese Zen. This is the main altar of a Vietnamese Buddhist temple near Seattle. In the front is a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha, the historical founder, while in the back is the \\"trinity\\" of Amitabha Buddha. On one side of Amitabha is Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva while on the other is Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva. Some scholars argue that the importance and prevalence of Thi·ªÅn in Vietnam has been greatly overstated and that it has played more of an elite rhetorical role than a role of practice.Alexander Soucy. \\"Nationalism, Globalism and the Re-establishment of the Tr√∫c L√¢m Thien Sect in Northern Vietnam.\\" in Philip Taylor (ed), Modernity and Re-enchantment: Religion in Post Revolutionary Vietnam. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies: Singapore, 2007; Cuong Tu Nguyen 1997, pg 342-3 The Thi·ªÅn uy·ªÉn t·∫≠p anh (, \\"Collection of Outstanding Figures of the Zen Garden\\") has been the dominant text used to legitimize Thi·ªÅn lineages and history within Vietnam. However, Cuong Tu Nguyen's Zen in Medieval Vietnam: A Study and Translation of the Thien Tap Anh (1997) gives a critical review of how the text has been used to create a history of Zen Buddhism that is \\"fraught with discontinuity\\". Modern Buddhist practices are not reflective of a Thi·ªÅn past; in Vietnam, common practices are more focused on ritual and devotion than the Thi·ªÅn focus on meditation.Alexander Soucy 2007; Cuong Tu Nguyen & A. W. Barber 1998. Nonetheless, Vietnam is seeing a steady growth in Zen today.Alexander Soucy 2007. Two figures who have been responsible for this increased interest in Thi·ªÅn are Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh, and Th√≠ch Thanh T·ª´, who lives in Da Lat. =Theravada= South East Asia circa 1010 CE, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) lands in yellow The central and southern part of present-day Vietnam were originally inhabited by the Chams and the Khmer people, respectively, who followed both a syncretic ≈öaiva-Mahayana (see History of Buddhism in Cambodia) and Theravada Buddhism. ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát annexed the land occupied by the Cham during conquests in the 15th century and by the 18th century had also annexed the southern portion of the Khmer Empire, resulting in the current borders of Vietnam. From that time onward, the dominant ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) followed the Mahayana tradition while the Khmer continued to practice Theravada.Ven.Phra Palad Raphin Buddhisaro. (2017). Theravada Buddhism: Identity, Ethnic, Retention of ‚ÄúKhmer‚Äôs Krom‚Äù in Vietnam. Journal of Bodhi Research [Bodhi Vijjalai Collage] Srinakharinwiwot University http://gps.mcu.ac.th/wp- content/uploads/2013/02/11004-32450-1-SM-1.pdf In the 1920s and 1930s, there were a number of movements in Vietnam for the revival and modernization of Buddhist activities. Together with the re-organization of Mahayana establishments, there developed a growing interest in Theravadin meditation as well as the PƒÅli Canon. These were then available in French. Among the pioneers who brought Theravada Buddhism to the ethnic ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát was a young veterinary doctor named L√™ VƒÉn Gi·∫£ng. He was born in the South, received higher education in Hanoi, and after graduation, was sent to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to work for the French government.Mae Chee Huynh Kim Lan.(2553/2010) A STUDY OF THERAVƒÄDA BUDDHISM IN VIETNAM.Thesis of Master of Arts (Buddhist Studies).Graduate School : Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University. During that time he became especially interested in Theravada Buddhist practice. Subsequently, he decided to ordain and took the Dhamma name of H·ªô-T√¥ng (Vansarakkhita). In 1940, upon an invitation from a group of lay Buddhists led by Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hi·ªÉu, he went back to Vietnam in order to help establish the first Theravada temple for Vietnamese Buddhists at G√≤ D∆∞a, Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c (now a district of H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City). The temple was named B·ª≠u Quang (Ratana Ramsyarama). The temple was destroyed by French troops in 1947, and was later rebuilt in 1951. At B·ª≠u Quang temple, together with a group of Vietnamese bhikkhus who had received training in Cambodia such as Thi·ªán Lu·∫≠t, B·ª≠u Ch∆°n, Kim Quang and Gi·ªõi Nghi√™m, H·ªô T√¥ng began teaching Buddhism in their native Vietnamese. He also translated many Buddhist materials from the Pali Canon, and Theravada became part of Vietnamese Buddhist activity in the country. In 1949‚Äì1950, H·ªô T√¥ng together with Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hi·ªÉu and supporters built a new temple in Saigon (now H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City), named K·ª≥ Vi√™n T·ª± (Jetavana Vihara). This temple became the centre of Theravada activities in Vietnam, which continued to attract increasing interest among the Vietnamese Buddhists. In 1957, the Vietnamese Theravada Buddhist Sangha Congregation (Gi√°o H·ªôi TƒÉng Gi√† Nguy√™n Th·ªßy Vi·ªát Nam) was formally established and recognised by the government, and the Theravada Sangha elected Venerable H·ªô T√¥ng as its first President, or Sangharaja. From Saigon, the Theravada movement spread to other provinces, and soon, a number of Theravada temples for ethnic Viet Buddhists were established in many areas in the South and Central parts of Vietnam. There are 529 Theravada temples throughout the country, of which 19 were located in H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City and its vicinity. Besides B·ª≠u Quang and K·ª≥ Vi√™n temples, other well known temples are B·ª≠u Long, Gi√°c Quang, Tam B·∫£o (ƒê√† N·∫µng), Thi·ªÅn L√¢m and Huy·ªÅn Kh√¥ng (Hu·∫ø), and the large Th√≠ch Ca Ph·∫≠t ƒê√†i in V≈©ng T√†u.http://dr.lib.sjp.ac.lk/bitstream/123456789/1677/1/Therav%C4%81da%20Buddhism%20in%20Vietnam.pdf  Gallery  Lascar One Pillar Pagoda (4550966464).jpgThe One Pillar Pagoda is a historic Mahayana Buddhist temple in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam.

It was based on the Fiat 124 saloon. Its four cylinder aluminum and iron, twin overhead cam 'Lampredi engine' was designed by ex-Ferrari engineer Aurelio Lampredi. Originally, the AC, or first generation, featured a 1,438 cc engine, which grew to 1,608 cc in the second, or BC, generation. The third generation, or CC, was first officially offered with the 1,592 cc and later the 1,756 cc engine (some early CC models left the factory with left over 1,608 cc engines). Equipment included a 5-speed gearbox (although very early AC models featured a 4-speed), four wheel power disc brakes, double wishbone front suspension, one carburetor per cylinder (Two dual-choke Weber or Solex carburetors on the BC series 1608 engine - except for the USA version which received mild carburation due to emissions constraints), electric fuel pump (on the CC series), and suspension by coil springs. The Fiat 124 Sport Coup√© was also built under license in Spain with 1600 (FC-00) and 1800 (FC-02) engines as the SEAT 124 Sport. Design The 124 Sport Coup√© was designed as a three-box, 2-door notchback coup√© by Mario Boano, known for styling the bodywork on the Ferrari 250 GT \\"Boano\\". As many parts as possible were used from the 1966 FIAT 124 Berlina saloon. Boano was hired by FIAT and made responsible for the in-house Centro Stile Fiat, while the iconic softtop Fiat 124 Sport Spider, which also shared the same basic platform as the 124 Sedan but rode on a 14 cm shorter wheelbase, was outsourced to famed Italian carrozzeria Pininfarina. Approximately 113,000 AC Coup√©s, 98,000 BC Coup√©s 1438 cc/1608 cc, and roughly 75,000 CC Coup√©s were manufactured. There were ongoing changes with all models making them almost individual by year (e.g. lack of rear sway bar on 1969 ACs, etc.) The Fiat 124 Spider Abarth came with dual Weber 44 IDF carburetors unlike the regular 124 coup√©s and spiders which were equipped with dual Weber 40 IDF carbs. Fiat twincam engines tend to be oversquare, with a larger diameter bore than length of stroke. The 1608 cc, however, is a perfectly square engine, 80 mm by 80 mm, allowing it, when combined with dual camshafts and proper carburetors, to rev to high rpms. =Engines= * 1400 (1438 cc) - * 1600 (1608 cc) - * 1600 (1592 cc) - * 1800 (1756 cc) - History =First series, 1967‚Äì69 (type 124 AC)= Fiat 124 Sport Coup√© AC *1967 AC - starts 000001 - #034513 *1968 AC - #034514 - #066279 *1969 AC - #066280 - #113869 The AC model began in 1967 and came with a 1438 cc twin cam, 4-speed gearbox (the option of a 5-speed item appearing in mid-'67), front and rear anti-roll bars and a torque tube rear axle. It featured a speedometer, three supplementary gauges, a faux wood steering wheel, a woodgrain dash and console top, as well as tail lights shared with the Lamborghini Espada and Iso Rivolta. 124 Sport Coup√©s were modern in chassis and engine design. Braking was via four 230 mm disc brakes with a front/rear weight-sensitive proportioning valve. It also had a sealed cooling system, viscous fan clutch and a toothed timing belt for the twin-cam engine, the first mass-produced engine to feature this instead of the usual chain-drive. The torque-tube rear axle of the A series was replaced by a four-link rear axle with a Panhard rod in mid-'68, and remained the same throughout B and C models. =Second series, 1969‚Äì72 (type 124 BC)= Fiat 124 Sport Coup√© 1600 BC 1969 *1970 BC - #113870 - #115876 *1971 BC 1438 cc - #115877 - #139912 *1971 BC1 1608 cc - #139913 *1972 BC1 1608 cc - #181442 The BC featured revised styling with twin headlights and revised taillights shared with the Lamborghini Jarama. The BC was available with both the 1438 cc and later (although sooner in Europe) the 1608 cc engine. Other details remained similar to the AC except the interior dash now had a speedometer, 9000 rpm tachometer in 1608 cc models and a clock. The steering wheel now had black painted spokes and the seats had for the first time cloth inserts in the centre. There was no woodgrain inside like before (all the panels were finished in black vinyl and the gauge rims were matt black) and \\"eyeball\\" vents were fitted in the centre console where the AC had a decorative panel simply filling in the space for an optional radio. Options included green tinted windows, Cromodora alloy wheels with chrome centre hub cap (as per AC optional), radio, seat headrests, rear windshield electric defrosting, electronic ignition. At the end of the BC run air conditioning was available as an option as well. The fuel tanks were always around . =Third series, 1972‚Äì75 (type 124 CC)= Fiat 124 Sport Coup√© CC *1973 CC 1608 cc - #206905 *1973 CC 1592 cc - #213370 *1974 CC1 1756 cc - #240100 *1975 CC1 1756 cc - #269934 The CC Coupe arrived in 1973 with new front styling and a revised squarer rear tail with a new deeper trunklid. Taillights also changed to a now vertical arrangement and side rear windows were revised. The CC started with a small batch fitted with the 1608 cc engine, soon changing to a revised 1592 cc engine (slightly shorter stroke at 79,2 mm to create a \\"sub-1600\\" engine to fit the lower tax bracket in Italy) and an enlarged 84 mm bore creating an engine of 1756 cc. The 1592 cc and 1756 cc (sourced from the new Fiat 132, introduced in 1972) both made use of a single carburetor again (the Weber 34 DMS). In spite of this change the 1756 cc was the most powerful engine produced with and a top speed of . The CC's revised interior featured a new dashboard incorporating a lower panel on the passenger side, an alloy fascia in front of the driver and seats covered completely in cloth. There was a new vinyl-covered steering wheel rim with anodised silver spokes. The optional but not uncommon Cromodora wheels now had a revised design with no chrome centre hubcap, instead having exposed wheelnuts. These were of an 8 slot design, the earlier wheels used coming in 6 slot configuration (an 8-slot design was also current but not original to the 124 range). SEAT 124 Sport Seat 124 SC 1600 The car was also built with 1600 (FC-00) and 1800 (FC-02) engines under license in Spain as the SEAT 124 Sport. The first series produced was equivalent to the BC series of Fiat's version, and used 1608 cc engines coded FA provided by Fiat itself. The second series was a direct copy of the CC model, and only used 1756 cc engines coded as FC, and less common 132AC. SEAT later developed facilities for producing its own engines of this family, but it appears that the Sport versions were actually built in Italy.

The genus members are commonly called bog clubmosses, describing their wetland habitat. The genus has a cosmopolitan, with centers of diversity in the tropical New World and New Guinea. In the past, the genus was often incorporated within the related genus Lycopodium, but was segregated in 1964. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodiella is placed in the subfamily Lycopodielloideae, along with three other genera. In this circumscription, the genus has about 15 species. Other sources use a wider circumscription, in which the genus is equivalent to the subfamily of PPG I, in which case about 40 species and hybrids are accepted.  Description  Lycopodiella are non-flowering plants. They have leafy rhizomes that grow along the ground and vertical, leafy shoots, also known as peduncles. Fertile peduncles have strobili at the top of the shoot. Individuals can have short, creeping rhizomes with simple strobili, branching rhizomes with many strobili, or anywhere in between. The North American specimens are typically shorter, have thinner shoots, and have fewer vertical shoots in the North than specimen in the South.  Life cycle  Lycopodiella life cycles include an independent sporophyte stage and a long-lived gametophyte stage. Individuals reproduce by single-celled spores that disperse and germinate into small plants when in suitable conditions. This part of the plant is called the gametophyte; it produces the eggs and sperm. After fertilization, the embryos grow into sporophytes, which are larger spore-bearing plants. The sporophyte is the vegetative part of the plant seen in nature. Juvenile individuals typically re-sprout in the spring or after a fire. Individuals have a base chromosome number of 78. Taxonomy In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Lycopodiella is placed in the subfamily Lycopodielloideae, along with three other genera (Lateristachys, Palhinhaea and Pseudolycopodiella). Other sources do not recognize these genera, submerging them into Lycopodiella.

The game was released in Europe and North America in late 2005, and in Japan and Australia in 2006. The game's sequel, Mario Strikers Charged, was also developed by Next Level Games and is available for the Wii. The game's developers had worked on NHL Hitz Pro before development of Strikers, which served as an influence for the fast-paced and physical nature of the game. This was also the last Mario game to be released on the GameCube. Strikers is a sports game incorporating characters and themes from the Mario franchise. The game features the basic aspects and objectives of a football game, although no referees are present and characters can legitimately shove others out of possession of the ball. As in other games such as Mario Power Tennis, the player can use Mario-themed items such as bananas and red shells to hinder the opposition and gain the advantage. Each team's captain can use \\"Super Strikes\\" that, if timed accurately, will result in two points scored for the striker's team. Each team comprises a goal keeper, a main Mario character (captain), and three of the same secondary Mario characters known as \\"sidekicks\\". The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In general, reviewers lauded Strikers' accessibility and multiplayer gameplay, but criticised the lack of gameplay modes and single-player offerings. Gameplay Opponents can be frozen by blue shells with the score tied between Waluigi and Peach. Super Mario Strikers is a five-a-side football console video game comprising characters and themes from the Mario series. Each team consists of a captain character from the Mario series and three secondary Mario characters known as \\"sidekicks\\". Kritter is the goalkeeper for all sides except the \\"Super Team\\", which consists of four captain robots and a Robo-Kritter. Both sidekicks and captains have varying gameplay attributes with \\"balanced\\" and \\"defensive\\" play types available. Strikers follows the basic gameplay featured in most football video games, including the ability to dash, tackle players, and lob the ball. Despite this, characters not in possession can legitimately hit opponents with or without the ball (\\"Big Hit\\"), resulting in a more arcade-like style of gameplay. The game also features \\"Perfect\\" passes and shots, which trigger in sequence if both a pass and shot are applied close to the opponent's goal. The most powerful shot possible is the \\"Super Strike\\", which only the captain can make and will account for two points if successful. Once charged, the player must time button presses accurately on a visible gauge to trigger a successful shot at a goal, resulting in a character-specific animation. As in other Mario sports titles such as Mario Power Tennis, the player can use items--bananas, red shells, etc.--to impede the opponent. Some \\"power ups\\" can aid the user by granting temporary imperviousness while others immobilize and hinder the opponent, Mario always gets the best power-ups. The player can also push opponents into electric barriers, which can electrocute them when they come in contact. The central antagonist of the Mario universe, Bowser, will also appear occasionally as a non-player character to obstruct the players from each side. Strikers includes six stadia, each having barriers to prevent the ball from going out of play. These stadia only vary aesthetically and do not affect gameplay, featuring different surfaces such as grass and wood. The player can adjust the match settings to limit or expand the match time and select whether features such as the Super Strike will be included. As the player advances through the game, further adjustments can be made called \\"cheats\\", that can render goalkeepers weaker and grant an infinite number of items. Strikers includes multiple gameplay modes such as the \\"Grudge Match\\", which is the standard single and multiplayer match mode of the game. Training sessions come in the form of \\"Strikers 101\\", where the player can practice individual aspects such as shooting and dashing. \\"Cup Battles\\" allows up to four players to compete in tournaments against artificial intelligence opponents to advance through more difficult cups for rewards, with \\"Super\\" denoting the higher-ranked tournaments. Development Strikers was developed by Next Level Games, who revealed the game at the E3 conference of 2005 in the form of a playable demonstration. In an interview, game director Mike Inglehart and marketing director Grace Kim revealed that Strikers was originally intended to be a more realistic Mario sports game, but the development team opted for an \\"over-the-top\\" style after numerous consultations with Nintendo. Next Level Games cited a connection between Strikers and NHL Hitz Pro in terms of gameplay mechanics, claiming that the latter influenced the \\"responsive gameplay\\" in Strikers, as well as the use of goalkeepers and on-field collisions. The developers revealed that the character system would be \\"balanced and fun\\", although Nintendo had \\"the ultimate say\\" in regards to character design, wanting strong and aggressive styles that did not deviate from past characterisations too much. For this reason, voice recording for Strikers required more lines and sounds than in other Mario sports titles. Assisted by producer Ken Yeeloy, Inglehart stated in an interview a willingness to link any new feature of Strikers with the sport of football. With this, they decided to accentuate \\"the exciting parts\\" of the game, with Inglehart using the electric fences in the stadia as an example in reference to the physicality of the sport. They also explained reasons for not using a penalty or card system, rating the power-up system as compensation for this considering power-ups are awarded to the team of a player that has been pushed or shoved. Reception Super Mario Strikers received generally positive reviews from critics, with reviewers lauding the game's characterisation and visual style, being reminiscent to that of Kazuto Nakazawa. GameSpot's Brian Ekberg praised the game's accessibility, stating that \\"Strikers' pick-up-and-play design will have you playing like a cartoon Pele in no time\\". Similarly, critics welcomed the developers' choice to forgo traditional football rules in the favour of a more arcade-like style of gameplay. Despite this, IGN complained of a \\"disappointingly slim\\" variety of modes, as well as the perceived small roster of characters and inflexibility when choosing teams. On a similar note, Eurogamer criticised the vague presentation of characters attributes, making it difficult to determine what their respective strengths and weaknesses are. Despite enjoying the variety and appearance of Strikers stadia, GameSpot noted only cosmetic differences among them, and criticised a lack of physical features to make them more interesting. Strikers multiplayer gameplay in particular was welcomed by reviewers, who praised the developers for providing aggressive and fast-paced action. Conversely, the game's single player offerings gained a less enthusiastic response, with critics noting \\"boring\\" and repetitive gameplay. GameSpot thought some features were \\"overpowered\\" in parts, including the big- hit tackles and the ability to dash constantly given the absence of a stamina meter. Despite this, Eurogamer remarked that it was deeper than first anticipated, while IGN lauded the game's \\"tight controls\\" and use of Super Strikes. The ability to push enemies into the electric barrier and the use of items was also welcomed as a means to make the game entertaining while playing defensively. The game's visuals received a mixed response, with critics reporting occasional problems with Strikers framerate. While praising the character models and goal animations, GameSpot bemoaned the absence of a \\"Mario feel\\" when appraising the menu and settings. IGN noted \\"blurry textures, uninspired stadium designs, and almost incomprehensibly a sometimes sluggish framerate\\", despite enjoying the characters art style. The audio received a mediocre response, with critics praising the use of character and audience chants while criticising a lack of variety and repetitiveness. GameSpot thought the menu music had \\"some nice flair to it\\", despite noting sounds such as Luigi's goal celebration that, while charming when first heard, became tedious. In Japan, Famitsu gave the game a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40; Famitsu Cube + Advance, on the other hand, gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one seven, for a total of 32 out of 40. Not all non-video game publications gave the same praise for the game. Common Sense Media gave it all five stars and called it \\"a perfect game for a bunch of teenagers to play because it's wacky, fast-paced, and just plain fun.\\" However, Maxim gave it a score of seven out of ten and stated that \\"With matches of five-on-five taking place on small fields with really basic controls, Strikers is classic arcade-style soccer, but the game gets an extra kick from power-ups, random Bowser attacks, and a Telemundo-style announcer.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it a similar score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \\"immediately likable\\". =Awards and sales= In GameSpot's E3 2005 coverage, this game was given the award \\"Best Sports Game,\\" and was nominated a finalist for \\"Best Game of Show.\\" It received GameSpy's \\"Game of the Year 2005\\" awards for \\"Best GameCube Sports\\", \\"Best GameCube Multiplayer\\", and was ranked second for all GameCube games in 2005. It was a finalist for \\"Sports Game of the Year\\" by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences for the 2006 Interactive Achievement Awards. Super Mario Strikers sold 950,000 copies in North America as of December 27, 2007. It sold 1.61 million copies overall.

It serves as a major transfer point for MBTA bus service. The station opened in 1927 and was completely rebuilt from 2004 to 2008, making it fully accessible. History The 1927-built station in 2004 Fields Corner and stations opened on November 5, 1927. Fields Corner was the southern terminus of the line for about a year until and opened in 1928. The elevated station was designed for efficient transfer between rapid transit trains and surface streetcars and buses. It had two island platforms with the rapid transit tracks in the center and the streetcar tracks on the outside (two tracks on the north side). A busway (later closed) was located at ground level on the south side of the station. The pedestrian tunnel from Charles Street was controversially closed in January 1970 due to crime and vandalism. In the mid-1980s, the platforms were extended for six-car trains, which were introduced in 1988. The MBTA issued a $4.3 million design contract for renovations of Ashmont, Shawmut, and Fields Corner stations on May 3, 2001. Shawmut and Fields Corner reached 100% design by January 10, 2003; Ashmont was delayed due to design changes. The MBTA broke ground for the Red Line Rehabilitation Project - a $67 million reconstruction of Shawmut, Fields Corner, and Savin Hill stations - in October 2003. Construction began in March 2004. The renovations changed the layout of the station, with a new fare lobby under the tracks. The new entrance lobby opened on December 22, 2006, making it the final fare-controlled station on the MBTA to be converted to use the CharlieCard-based automated fare collection system. The station renovation was completed on September 23, 2008.

The Mafia Encyclopedia: Second Edition, New York, Checkmark Books, 1999. (pg. 33) although the earliest recorded barrel murders in New York were reported in 1895 and 1900. The victims, usually Italian immigrants, would be found stuffed inside a barrel after being shot, stabbed, or strangled to death, and left on a random street corner or back alley, or shipped to a nonexistent address in another city. First used by the Sicilian Provenzano crime family in New Orleans and the Morello crime family in New York City, the barrel murders eventually alerted authorities to the existence of the Mafia, leading to the later investigation by New Orleans police chief David C. Hennessy, whose own eventual assassination was attributed to Sicilian mafiosi in 1890, resulting in one of the largest mass lynchings in U.S. history. New York detective Joseph Petrosino's early investigations into the New York barrel murders would lead to a crackdown against the Black Hand and the Morellos until his assassination in 1909. The Morellos, suspected of over 100 murders, continued to use the barrel murder for over thirty years until eventually ceasing after the (now well-publicized) murders resulted in unwanted attention from local authorities. Other non- Italian criminals used the same method to draw police suspicion away from themselves onto the Morellos and other Italian mafiosi. Recent use The method was later used in Johnny Roselli's death when he was found in a 55-gallon oil drum off the coast of Florida in 1976. It is generally believed Roselli was murdered in revenge for his skimming profits from Las Vegas casinos, but given Roselli's involvement with CIA plots against Fidel Castro in Cuba, others have suggested that Roselli's death was not at the hands of fellow mobsters but that the killers used the barrel method to cast suspicion towards the Mafia.

The highway runs from Agnew near Lake Michigan to the west side of Grand Rapids in the western Lower Peninsula. Lake Michigan Drive continues in each direction from M-45's termini, extending west of US Highway 31 (US 31) and east of Interstate 196 (I-196). In between, the road runs through rural and suburban areas of Ottawa and Kent counties, including the main campus of Grand Valley State University in Allendale. Lake Michigan Drive was originally part of M-50 until the mid-1960s. Previously in the 1920s and 1930s, the M-45 number was designated along a highway in the Upper Peninsula (UP). Route description Lake Michigan Drive starts near Lake Michigan at an intersection with Lakeshore Drive near the Grand Rapids water filtration plant. The road runs east to an intersection with US 31 in Agnew, where the M-45 designation begins. The area is marked by a mix of woodland and agricultural properties. The road runs through rural Ottawa County to Allendale. Through town, Lake Michigan Drive widens to a four-lane divided boulevard with a median. East of the main part of town, M-45 passes the main campus of Grand Valley State University before crossing the Grand River. At 24th Avenue, the highway loses its median and gains a central turn lane. The landscape becomes more suburban as the highway crosses into Kent County near the M-11 intersection in Walker. From here east to the terminus in Grand Rapids, the road is lined with residential subdivisions and commercial properties. At Bridge Street, Lake Michigan Drive turns to the southeast and approaches John Ball Zoological Garden. M-45 ends at the interchange with I-196. Lake Michigan Drive continues east to its end where it becomes Pearl Street near the Grand River downtown. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-45 like all other parts of the state trunkline highway system. As part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of the traffic using its roadways which is expressed using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This is a calculation of the traffic levels for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, 4,910 vehicles used the section of M-45 near the western terminus daily. Near the interchange with I-196, 32,376 vehicles were observed along Lake Michigan Drive each day. No segment of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History =Previous designation= M-45 was originally designated in the UP on what is now M-95 by July 1, 1919. The highway ran between M-12 in Sagola and M-15 in Humboldt Township. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US 2 replaced most of M-12 through the UP. M-45 was extended south of Sagola to the north side of Iron Mountain. Along with this change, M-69 replaced another previous section of M-12 and all of M-90. M-69 ran concurrently with M-45 between Sagola and Randville to connect these two highway segments. By 1933, M-45 was extended concurrently along US 2/US 141 into Iron Mountain and then as an independent routing through Kingsford to the Wisconsin state line. Before the next year, the M-95 replaced M-45 in the UP. =Current designation= The current designation of M-45 dates back to 1964. M-50 was truncated to end near Lowell at I-96. The remainder of M-50 on Cascade Road, Fulton Street and Lake Michigan Drive was redesignated as M-45. The eastern section from Business US 131 (Division Avenue) to I-96 was turned over to local control in 1972, shortening the route. The east end would be shortened again by 1995, removing the M-45 designation east of I-196. Jurisdiction was only transferred to the City of Grand Rapids on the portion from Division Avenue west to the Grand River, leaving part of West Fulton Street under state maintenance as an unsigned trunkline. M-45 was upgraded to a four-lane divided highway in 2001‚Äì02 between Walker and the Grand Valley State campus in Allendale. The new alignment bypassed a section of road between 24th and 40th avenues. That section was renamed River Hill Drive, but retained as an unsigned state trunkline (Old M-45).

Based in Jackson, Michigan, the chain operated primarily in Michigan and Florida, but also had stores in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Kansas. Jacobson's focused on apparel, fine jewelry and home furnishings. The chain entered bankruptcy in early 2002 after 164 years of service. One store in Winter Park, Florida was re- established as Jacobson's in 2004, but closed in 2011. History The first Jacobson's store was opened by Abram Jacobson in Reed City, Michigan in 1838. It eventually expanded to Ann Arbor, Battle Creek and Jackson, Michigan as well, moving its headquarters to Jackson in 1937. Two years later, brothers Zola and Nathan Rosenfeld purchased the company and began expanding it throughout the state. Zola held the title of company president at the time of his death in 1961, while Nathan remained chairman until his 1982 death. In 1945, Nathan Rosenfeld hired J. Russell Fowler, a former manager for the Jordan Marsh chain, to manage Jacobson's as well. Under Fowler's management, Jacobson's saw a significant increase in sales and expanded into Florida. Despite declining sales in the 1980s, the chain attempted two prototypes: a more upscale store at Laurel Park Place in Livonia and a discount store in Troy. =1990s= Jacobson's faced further retail decline in the early 1990s. In 1991, the store began operating on Sundays. Previously, Jacobson's stores were closed on Sundays, as it was believed that doing so would help to attract a better caliber employee. Also that year, the chain opened a store in Naples, Florida, and moved its flagship from downtown Ann Arbor to a former Lord & Taylor location at Briarwood Mall. A location in Birmingham, Michigan was also renovated to target upscale shoppers in their mid-twenties. The chain made further changes to its retail line in the 1990s, expanding its plus-size clothing lines and adding other lines catered to younger shoppers. A decision was also made to control the growth of stores, by only opening one or two a year. The chain's first Kentucky location, in Louisville, opened in 1994. In 1995, however, Jacobson's posted its biggest loss since 1977, and as a result, three Metro Detroit locations were closed and thirty-two workers were laid off. In addition, competitors Nordstrom and Parisian had begun opening locations in Detroit, increasing the chain's competition. Jacobson's also opened locations in Leawood, Kansas and Boca Raton, Florida. By 1997, Jacobson's had twenty-four stores in operation. The chain began to promote its customer service and quality through marketing, and although the Midwestern locations continued to lose money, the Florida stores remained profitable. An East Lansing, Michigan location that opened in 1970 was relocated to a new store on the site of a former Service Merchandise at Meridian Mall in nearby Okemos in 2000. =2000s= In 2002, however, Jacobson's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and closed five stores, including one at The Fashion Mall at Keystone in Indianapolis, Indiana, as well as the Meridian Mall location. After failing to find a buyer, Jacobson's began liquidation on its last remaining stores, and was closed by the end of 2002. The Briarwood Mall store and another at Laurel Park Place in Livonia, Michigan were both sold to Davenport, Iowa-based Von Maur. In early 2004, Longwood, Florida-based Jake's Stores bought the naming rights and re-established Jacobson's in Florida. The company's headquarters in Jackson found a new tenant in baked goods manufacturer Dawn Foods in 2004. The second incarnation of Jacobson's never saw the planned expansion ever take place. After nearly eight years of doing business as a one-store operation near the former Winter Park, Florida Jacobson's location, the \\"new\\" Jacobson's closed on December 21, 2011. Its owner, Tammy Giaimo, shuttered the one location with plans to open a store using a different name near another company she owned.

Edward Middlebrooks (born June 11, 1955 in Baltimore, Maryland), is an American politician. Most recently, he was a member of the County Council for District 2 of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. A Republican, he served as the Council's Chairperson until his term ended in December 2010. Education Middlebrooks graduated from Glen Burnie High School in Glen Burnie, Maryland. He earned an Associate of Arts degree from Anne Arundel Community College, a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Baltimore in 1985 and a law degree from the University of Baltimore in 1988. Legal career Middlebrooks is a criminal defense attorney who claims on his web site that he ‚Äúhandles all types of serious crimes, as well as traffic offenses, such as driving with a suspended driver‚Äôs license, driving after revocation, driving without insurance, reckless driving, and DUI‚Äù and has ‚Äúsuccessfully defended hundreds of clients facing serious criminal charges.‚Äù Middlebrooks is the sole partner in the Glen Burnie law firm known as C. Edward Middlebrooks, P.A.. Political career Middlebrooks began his political career as a member of the Democratic State Central Committee from 1982 to 1990. This fact has been excised from much of the official state information as his official bios (County Council and Senate) either omit this information or incorrectly claim that he was on the Republican Central Committee. But the archives records it correctly. Middlebrooks then served as a Democrat on the Anne Arundel County Council for the 2nd District from 1990 to 1994. In 1994, Middlebrooks switched parties to challenge incumbent Senator Michael Wagner for the Dist. 32 state Senate seat. That year was a big year for the Republicans as they swept offices across the country, and almost won the Maryland Governor‚Äôs race. Middlebrooks beat Wagner for the senate seat.Maryland State Board of Elections He was voted chairman of the Anne Arundel County Council in 1997. Then, in 1998, a poor year for Republicans in Maryland, Middlebrooks was challenged by Ed DeGrange. Middlebrooks lost to DeGrange days after an advertisement funded by the committee to support democratic candidate James Ed DeGrange was released. Directly attacking Mr. Middlebrooks, the literature depicted pictures of crying baby faces and accused Mr. Middlebrooks of being a bad role model for children. Due to the amount of time in which the ad was released, the rebuttal advertisement issued by the Committee to support republican candidate Ed Middlebrooks was not delivered before the election. Mr. Middlebrooks also was out of time to file charges of slander against James Ed DeGrange for the literature. In 2002 Mr. Middlebrooks ran again for the Anne Arundel County Council seat and won against Green Party candidate George Law and the incumbent Dan Klosterman after filing a lawsuit against Mr. Klosterman for attempting to redistribute the 1998 literature. Middlebrooks' brother, Gary Middlebrooks, ran for his brother's seat in the Republican County Council primary in District 2 on Tuesday, September 14, 2010. Gary Middlebrooks lost by 87 votes to his opponent, John Grasso.

Music organizations in Vienna include the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, which has been promoting musical development in the city since 1812. The Vienna Boys Choir has an even longer history, dating back to 1498, while the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is also renowned . Major music venues in Vienna include the State Opera House, the People's Opera House, the Burgtheater, and the Theater an der Wien, the former three of which are owned by the federal government . Viennese classicism The city was home to many great composers of the classical music era, during the early 19th century, such as Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven; this was called Viennese classicism . Schrammelmusik The most popular form of modern Austrian folk music is Viennese schrammelmusik, which is played with an accordion and a double-necked guitar. Modern performers include Roland Neuwirth, Karl Hodina and Edi Reiser. Schrammelmusik arose as a mixture of rural Austrian, Hungarian, Slovenian, Moravian and Bavarian immigrants crowded the slums of Vienna. At the time, waltzes and l√§ndlers mixed with the music of the immigrants absorbing sounds from all over central and eastern Europe and the Balkans. The name Schrammelmusik comes from two of the most popular and influential performers in Schrammelmusik's history, brothers Johann and Josef Schrammel. The Schrammels formed a trio called along with bass guitarist Anton Strohmayer and helped bring the music to the middle- and upper-class Viennese, as well as people from surrounding areas. With the addition of a clarinetist, George D√§nzer, they formed the Schrammel-Quartett, and Schrammelmusik's form settled on a quartet. Neuwirth is a younger performer who has incorporated foreign influences, most especially the blues, to some criticism from purists. He is the leader of the band Extremschrammeln.

It is a mostly sedentary bird, found in a variety of open habitats. Within range, its penetrating and rhythmic, three-syllabled crooning is a familiar sound at any time of the year. Its name is derived from the semi-collar of black feathers on the lower nape, a feature shared with a number of Streptopelia species. Like all doves, they depend on surface water. They congregate in large flocks at waterholes in dry regions to drink and bathe. Description The plumage tones are darkest on the upper parts, while the lower belly and vent are white Their body feathers are darkest on the upper side, where they are coloured in dull tones of grey and brown, with shades of lavender on the nape. It is paler below, where a tint of pinkish lavender is usually present. The lower belly and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) is white. As with related species, they have white fringes and conspicuous white tips to the otherwise slate grey tail feathers. The tail pattern is particularly noticeable during the display flight. Individual plumage variation is high, with some light and others almost sooty. Males and females look alike, although the males are slightly bigger. They measure in length and weigh .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . The eyes are almost black, the bill is black and the feet are dark purple. An immature is duller and lacks the semi-collar of an adult. It also has buff edges to all the upper part and wing covert feathers, while the plumage below is broadly edged greyish-white. Habitat It occupies a diverse range of habitat types, including semi-desert scrub, Boscia and Acacia savannah, a variety of woodland types, farmlands, open plantations and alien acacia thickets. Only closed forest or plantations, or the extensive waterless dune fields and gravel plains of the Namib are unsuited to their requirements. In southern Africa, they are most commonly observed in fynbos regions, miombo and mopane woodlands, besides any grassland types from moist to dry regions. Their presence in the latter areas has been facilitated by the planting of trees in groves, for instance around farm homesteads. They are vulnerable at exposed waterholes or in plantations, where they are preyed on by lanner falcons and black sparrowhawks, respectively. In addition, they are preyed on by reptiles, wildcats, jackals, genets, herons, storks, eagles and barn owls. Nests are vulnerable to birds, snakes and, locally, eastern grey squirrels. Seasonal movements are most noticeable in tropical areas, while nomadic movements occur in arid environments with limited resources. They seldom occur above 2,000 metres. Habits These doves are usually found alone or in pairs, although they do form larger flocks around roosts or sources of food and water, sometimes comprising hundreds of birds. They are quite noisy in these groups, not only for the various calls they make throughout the day, or often into (mainly moonlit) nights, but also due to the loud clatter of their wings when they take flight. Song Their song is a loud and harsh ‚Äúkuk-COORRRR-uk, ...‚Äù (sometimes interpreted as 'how's father?' or 'work harder') which they may repeat ten to forty times. Less often a repeated ‚Äúwuh-ka-RROOO, ...‚Äù may be given. A raspy, snarling ‚Äúkooorr‚Äù, or ‚Äúknarrrrrr‚Äù, call is often given when it alights on a perch, arrives at an incubating mate or chases another dove away. Ring-necked doves roost in treetops during the night and forage for food on the ground by day. Peak foraging times are early morning and late afternoon, and they drink mainly in the morning. When they walk on the ground, their heads bob back and forth with each small step. Food They feed mainly on seeds (of grasses, cereal grains, lupins, milkweeds, alien acacias and pines), but also on broken fruit and berries (of oaks, gums, currants and Lantana), and insects on occasion (earthworms, termites, weevils and other). Other recorded food items include small sedge bulbs, fleshy succulent leaves, aloe nectar and sugary aphid secretions. Breeding Egg in the Museum Wiesbaden collection They are monogamous, territorial nesters. Males display by flapping up a steep gradient before spiraling down with wings and tail spread out. From a perch or on the ground, the male will engage in a bowing display synchronized with a rolling crooning, ‚Äúuk-carrroooo, ...‚Äù, while the throat is inflated. A pair will give a double coo with a long second syllable when selecting a nest site. The female takes two to three days to construct the flimsy platform nest. It is made of twigs and leaf petioles that are carefully selected by the male (as in other dove species) and delivered to her at the nest site. The nest is placed 2 to 10 meters above the ground on a horizontal branch fork. Quite often, an old nest of another species may be used. Two to four pure white eggs are laid and both sexes participate in the incubation, which takes about two weeks. Chicks are fed regurgitated food by both parents and fledge after about 16 days. Several broods (up to five) may be raised in a single season. Subspecies There are six subspecies. They differ mainly in plumage shade, with those of dry regions being paler and greyer. Western Ethiopian and South Sudanese birds are sometimes separated from S. c. tropica as S. c. electa (Madar√°sz, 1913). * S. c. capicola ‚Äì southwestern (winter rainfall) South Africa * S. c. abunda Clancey, 1960 ‚Äì central South Africa * S. c. damarensis (Hartlaub & Finsch, 1870) ‚Äì arid interior of southern Africa * S. c. onguati Macdonald, 1957 ‚Äì western Namibia and Angola * S. c. tropica (Reichenow, 1902) ‚Äì tropical and subtropical woodlands from South Africa to South Sudan * S. c. somalica (Erlanger, 1905) ‚Äì northern Tanzania to Somalia and Ethiopia Similar species A number of Streptopelia species are very similar in appearance, all having semi-collars and subdued plumage tones. The ring-necked dove is distinguished from its locally sympatric sister species, the African collared dove, by call, the paler bases of the tail feathers, and the grey rather than pink crown feathers. On appearance alone, it may also be confused with the Eurasian collared dove, vinaceous dove, red-eyed dove, red collared dove, mourning collared dove or the Barbary dove, the last of these a popular cage bird with isolated feral populations. The red-eyed dove is generally similar, with an identical display flight. It, however, has dark wine red eyes and is larger and darker altogether, with a grey belly and grey tail tips. The mourning collared dove has more grey about the head and pale yellow eyes. The Eurasian collared dove was introduced into the United States and is now found in nearly every state in the U.S. as well as in Mexico.

In 1870, Brooklyn absorbed the nearby town of Lynn, which housed a footwear industry, and incorporated as a city. The San Francisco and Oakland Railroad had built a station at San Antonio. When the Central Pacific Railroad took over the line in 1870, the name was changed to Brooklyn. In 1872, voters approved their city's annexation by Oakland. Afterward, when the Southern Pacific Railroad took over the rail line in 1883, the Brooklyn station name was changed to East Oakland.

Coffee Around 90% of Matthew Algie‚Äôs green coffee comes from Fairtrade co-operatives. The company has contributed over $3miilion (US) to community and farm projects through Fairtrade levies to date. The remainder of its green coffee comes from independent coffee farmers, with whom the company has direct trading relationships. Matthew Algie uses traditional Probat drum roasting with advanced software and is thought to be the only coffee roaster to use cryogenics to produce its ground coffee. Matthew Algie sells both filter and espresso coffees, including three triple certified espresso coffees (Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance and Organic) and the Freshly Roasted espresso range, with the promise of being delivered to customers within 7 days of roasting. Everything but the Coffee In 1997 Matthew Algie launched Espresso Warehouse (with the strapline ‚ÄòEverything but the Coffee‚Äô) to support the growing wave of independent coffee bars. Espresso Warehouse products are sold to coffee retailers in the UK and Ireland as well as through distributors in Europe. Products include tea (Suki tea, loose leaf tea and Pavilion Garden) hot chocolate (Chocolate Abyss), syrups (Da Vinci) biscuits and cookies (Wooden Spoon and The Fine Cookie Co) and a wide range of barista equipment and coffee bar hardware. History Matthew Algie (born 1810 in Greenock, Scotland, died 1902) was a grocer who sold tea that had been imported to Scotland on the Clyde Clippers. He established Matthew Algie the tea blending and wholesaling business in 1864. For around 80 years, and through two World Wars, the business sold tea and spices to retailers in the Glasgow area. In 1950 the company, then known as Algie‚Äôs, started selling coffee to post-war Glasgow, along with vending services. In 1974 ‚ÄúAlgie‚Äôs‚Äù began selling coffee machines for offices, restaurants and hotels, replacing instant coffee with roast and ground coffee. In the 1980s the business went through a period of rapid expansion, going UK-wide and adding bulk-brew coffee machines for the catering sector to their portfolio. In 1989 the company introduced the first espresso machine to its range. In 1995, Managing Director, David Williamson, a descendant of Matthew Algie, visited Portland Oregon and returned to restructure the company with a view to driving the espresso revolution in the UK. In 1997 Matthew Algie introduced the UK‚Äôs first Fairtrade espresso beans, followed in 2004 by the world‚Äôs first triple-certified espresso (Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance and Organic)In 2008, David Williamson died unexpectedly at the age of 42. The David Williamson Rwanda Foundation was set up in David‚Äôs memory. In 2010 the company underwent its biggest rebranding exercise to date. In 2016 it was sold to Tchibo with the intention to retain the brand and possibly expand it into Tchibo's existing markets in central Europe.

It was bought by Myer (later Coles Myer) in 1983. There were 25 stores across New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory plus a few in Victoria, until they were re-branded under the Myer name in 2004. History Albert Edward Grace, the head of Grace Bros department store and his secretary in his office The Broadway Grace Bros store in the 1930s Grace Bros had a long and rich history of retailing in New South Wales, especially in Sydney following its founding by the Grace brothers, Albert Edward and Joseph Neal Grace, in 1885.History Grace Bros The two brothers migrated from England in the 1880s and sold goods door-to-door. In 1885, they opened their first small shop in George Street, Sydney and by 1906, they had opened a five-storey building at Broadway (now the site of the Broadway Shopping Centre). In 1931, Joseph Neal Grace died and Albert Grace became Managing Director of Grace Bros. Prior to his death in 1938, Albert Grace planned suburban expansion of the Grace Bros stores from the City, a move which is considered the reason Grace Bros survived when many of their contemporaries perished such as Anthony Horderns and Mark Foy's. Isabel Grace died in 1970 at age of 86 years. =Broadway= Sydney's major Grace Bros was located on Broadway. Through several different stores at varied locations in the city, the store first came to Bay Street in 1904. Subsequent additions and property purchases over the years culminated in the existing buildings being completed in 1923. Grace Bros boasted a store with, among many features, \\"three and a half acres of furniture\\"! The Grace auditorium dominated the social life of Sydney with dances, fashion parades, children's events displays and pantomimes held within it. 1954 saw the Royal Visit of Queen Elizabeth II with the Broadway stores extensively decorated. However, the centre of Sydney shopping gradually moved from Broadway into the current CBD around Market and Pitt Streets, and Grace Bros vacated the Broadway store in 1992. The building was resurrected as a multimillion-dollar retail and cinema complex in 1998. =The Grace Building= In 1926, the Grace Brothers, Albert Edward and Joseph Neal Grace, purchased a block of land on the corner of York, Clarence and King streets in Sydney, on which they would build the \\"Grace Building\\", the jewel in the crown of their retail empire. They believed the site was perfectly positioned for the building they planned would become \\"The Showpiece of the Company\\", with new public transport routes and the coming Sydney Harbour Bridge turning York and Clarence Streets in the major city thoroughfares. Company letterhead even showed the building as being \\"...on the Harbour Bridge Highway.\\" Broadway had been affected by the shift of the city's commercial district toward Circular Quay and the changing public transport routes away from Sydney's South end, and so the Grace Building was to be the company's saviour. The Grace Building was officially opened by Sydney Lord Mayor Ernest Marks on 3 July 1930. York Street never became the shopping thoroughfare the Grace Brothers had envisaged and, combined with the effects of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the building never lived up to expectations. By the onset of World War II Grace Bros was experiencing difficulty in leasing office suites and much of the space was allocated to government departments. In 1943 the Grace Building was requisitioned under national security regulations by the Federal Government for use as headquarters by the Supreme Commander of allied forces in the south-west Pacific, General Douglas MacArthur. In 1945, the Grace Building was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth. In 1995, it was purchased by the Low Yat Group of Kuala Lumpur for adaptive reuse as a 382-room hotel, opening in 1997.\\"Chronology of the Grace Building\\" at Teaching Heritage, NSW Government =Suburban store growth= Grace Bros, Parramatta in 1939 Grace Bros opened two small stores in suburban Sydney (in Westfield Parramatta and Westfield Bondi Junction) as early as in 1933; these stores were completely rebuilt and expanded in 1957 into the first department stores in Australia designed with the family car in mind. In 1965, the Roselands Shopping Centre opened as one of the first major shopping centres in Australia. The centrepiece was a large Grace Bros department store. Suburban stores were subsequently opened at Stockland Mall Maroubra (became a clearance outlet from September 1994, closed 2002), Westfield Mount Druitt (opened 1973, closed June 2004), Westfield Hurstville (closed 24 January 2015), Westfield Miranda, Westfield Parramatta, Westfield Penrith, Ryde (closed 1985), Westfield Bondi Junction, Westfield Burwood (now a David Jones), Blacktown, Castle Hill, Westfield Hornsby (opened 1979), Westfield Liverpool, Carlingford Court (now a Target), Westfield Chatswood, Macquarie Centre and Westfield Warringah Mall.Store Locations Grace Bros The Castle Hill store which opened on 11 August 2001, was the final store to be opened under the Grace Bros brand and was also the final store to be designed in NSW, with a team at the Roselands support office overseeing all the plans and development. =Country Stores= Over the years, Grace Bros opened and also acquired other stores as part of its expansion. Notable was the acquisition of publicly listed Queanbeyan and Canberra retailer, JB Young's during late 1979.Grace Bros Canberra Times 9 January 1980 page 20 The JB Young's stores traded under this name until mid 1986 when rebranded to Grace Bros.Youngs changes name to Grace Bros Canberra Times 6 February 1986 page 7 By acquiring JB Young's, Grace Bros also became the owner of the value positioned, apparel and manchester retailer Fossey's and benefited from stores JB Young's had acquired in their 1974 purchase of NSW retailer John Meagher & Co. There was a specific \\"Country Division\\" within Grace Bros based in Canberra, established in 1985 at the time of the name change from Youngs to Grace Bros. The Country Division was responsible for regional merchandising at the stores including Kingston, Woden Valley, Dickson, Civic, Fyshwick, Quenbeyan, Goulburn, Cooma, and Batemans Bay. The Country Division also included former Myer (some of which were branded \\"The Western Stores\\"(Originally Western Stores & Edgelys, Acquired by Farmers & Co. early 1960. )) in Bathurst, Dubbo, Gosford, Orange, Wagga Wagga, Young, Cowra, Newcastle, Cessnock and Tamworth. New country stores were opened in Wollongong, Charlestown, Erina (relocated from Gosford). Both Newcastle and Cessnock closed when new store opened at Charlestown in 1989. Some of the stores that have closed include Goulburn (closed 1995), Ulladulla, Nowra (closed 2003), Tamworth (converted in 2003 to a Target), Bathurst (closed 2004), Cooma, Queanbeyan, Bairnsdale (after becoming a Myer, converted to a Kmart in 2004). In 1982 there were plans to open a Grace Bros. in Strathpine, Queensland but due to the take over of Myer NSW by Grace Bros. Holdings the store opened at the Strathpine Centre as a Myer in 1983 and remained opened until 2007. Myer Wollongong closed on 3 October 2016. Myer Orange closed on 29 January 2017, after 167 years of trading through various owners, 21 of those years it was branded Grace Bros. =Taken over= In July 1982, Grace Bros sold its 57% shareholding in Norman Ross to Waltons.99pc Control after Grace Bros sell stake Canberra Times 23 July 1982 page 16 In April 1983 Grace Bros purchased most of Myer's New South Wales stores excluding Albury, Gordon, Miranda and Tweed Heads.Grace Bros and Myer in $65m deal Canberra Times 12 February 1983 page 1Grace Bros assumes control of Myer retailing in April Canberra Times 16 February 1983 page 34 Having been the subject of a battle for control with the Adelaide Steamship Company, Bond Corporation, FAI Insurance, Myer, Westfield and Woolworths all buying and selling sizeable blocks of shares in 1982/83, Myer's takeover bid for Grace Bros was successful in June 1983.40 Per Cent of Retailer in Friendly Hands Canberra Times 22 June 1982 page 19Woolworths moves on Grace Bros Canberra Times 30 June 1982 page 36Grace Bros recommends takeover Canberra Times 20 August 1982 page 12FAI grabs a stake in the Grace maze Canberra Times 25 March 1983 page 13Bond launches bid to break impasse in Grace Bros Canberra Times 31 March 1983 page 11Myer wins Grace saga Canberra Times 16 June 1983 page 22 The Myer store on Market and Pitt Streets in Sydney became the main Grace Bros store.

Biography He was born in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, in what was then called Trucial Oman, sometime around 1840. He lived much of his early life with the Bedouin of Abu Dhabi. He was made Ruler of Abu Dhabi after the deposition of his cousin, Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun, in 1855. He ruled for 54 years, until his death in 1909.Al-Hajji 2001, pp. 129‚Äì36.He had a wife called Maitha Almansoori. Early in his rule, Zayed guided Abu Dhabi through a series of conflicts with the Emirate of Sharjah. In 1868, during an armed clash with Sharjah's forces, he advanced ahead of his troops and challenged the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Khalid bin Sultan Al Qasimi, to single combat. Zayed wounded Khalid mortally and the death of Khalid brought an end to the conflict - although outbreaks of internecine conflict continued to be the norm among the coastal communities.Al-Hajji 2001, p 140 Zayed also led Abu Dhabi in an extended war with Qatar in the 1880s that secured the western border of Abu Dhabi.Al-Hajji 2001, pp 171-4 He united with Omani forces to drive the Saudi troops from the Buraimi area in 1870. This left the forts defending the Buraimi Oasis in permanent control of Abu Dhabi and forced the Saudis to abandon their designs on Oman. Abu Dhabi's influence and control over this area steadily grew afterwards.Al-Hajji 2001, pp. 175‚Äì6. In 1895, Zayed saw in Al Zorah (today part of Ajman) an ideal base for supplying Bani Qitab forces loyal to him in conflicts with the Northern Sheikhs and applied to the British Resident for permission to move supplies there by sea. Unaware of the true reasons for the movement, the Resident gave permission but Zayed faced opposition in his scheme from other Sheikhs and was unable to complete the movement. In 1897, a section of the Sudan (singular Al Suwaidi) tribe under Sultan bin Nasser Al Suwaidi requested permission to settle Al Zorah with the support of Zayed (himself a Suwaidi on his mother's side and married to one of Sultan's daughters) and this was granted by the Resident. Alarmed by the scheme, the Ruler of Ajman built a fort at one of the waterways connecting Al Zorah with the mainland (it was at the time an island) and the Ruler of Sharjah, in 1890, appealed to the Resident to prevent this establishment of a non-Al Qasimi stronghold in the midst of his territory. This being upheld, to the annoyance of Zayed who had seen Al Zorah as an extension of his claim to the Northern coast, the scheme was abandoned and the decision to block it was subsequently upheld after a visit to Al Zorah by Major Cox, the British Political Resident. Zayed was also noted by Percy Cox to be \\"troublesome\\" and guided the rest of the Sheikhs of Dubai and Umm Al Quwain to not adopt the White Pierced Red flag, the intended flag of the Truical States, referencing that the flag represents the Al Qawasim tribal federation. In 1892, Zayed signed a treaty with the United Kingdom which effectively ceded control of Abu Dhabi's international commercial relations to the British. By 1894, Zayed was considered the most powerful of the Trucial Sheikhs, replacing the hegemony of Sharjah. Through strategic marriages he had many sons. The eldest of whom was named Khalifa, and had maternal heritage from the Manasir people. He had a brother called Dhiyab who had three sons, Sultan, Mohammed, and Ahmed.

The Whizzinator comes as a kit complete with dried urine and syringe, heater packs (to keep the urine at body temperature), a false penis (available in several skin tones including white, tan, Latino, brown, and black) and instruction manual. The company also offered a female version of the Whizzinator, called \\"Number One.\\" There is no information on exactly how this product differs from the \\"disposable unisex\\" product also on the market. It was manufactured by Puck Technology of Signal Hill, California; a suburb of Los Angeles. The device received media coverage in May 2005 in the United States after Onterrio Smith, a former Minnesota Vikings running back, was caught with one at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, which resulted in his suspension. Actor Tom Sizemore has also brought the Whizzinator into the public eye after having been caught with one attempting to evade drug tests. In 2006, a Pittsburgh-area woman and her friend were charged with disorderly conduct and criminal mischief after they asked a convenience store clerk to microwave one of the devices so the woman could pass a drug test. The clerk, thinking it was a real penis, called police. The mischief charge was dropped after the friend agreed to replace the oven (OSHA regulations do not allow an oven to be used when bodily fluids are placed in it). The United States Congress held hearings on the Whizzinator on May 17, 2005. The Whizzinator continues to appear occasionally in news stories. In August 2015, a Chicago man on probation in Indiana was probably caught using the device to cheat on a mandatory drug test. He had gone to the probation office for Cook County, Illinois to take the test, and according to a police report repeatedly looked over his shoulder while urinating for the test, which drew the suspicion of a probation officer. Federal fraud case On October 14, 2008, the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania won a 19-count indictment against Puck Technology, maker of the Whizzinator, and its owners for fraud and selling drug paraphernalia. Prosecutors allege that by manufacturing and selling the Whizzinator, Puck Technology, company president Gerald Wills and vice president Robert Catalano conspired to defraud the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which administers federal workplace drug testing programs. The government sought forfeiture of all of the company's assets, including its Internet domain names.Cato, Jason. Buchanan takes on drug-test cheaters. Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, 2008-10-15.

Deathcore consists of death metal guitar riffs, blast beats, and metalcore breakdowns. Deathcore gained most prominence within the southwestern United States, especially Arizona and inland southern California (mostly the Coachella Valley), which are home to many notable bands and various festivals.Official SoCal DeathFest banner - held in Santa Ana, California roadrunnerrecords.com \\"Ferret Music has announced the signing of ELYSIA.

The genre expanded in the mid‚Äìlate 2000s with the emergence of bands like Through the Eyes of the Dead, Bring Me the Horizon, Suicide Silence, Carnifex, Job for a Cowboy, Chelsea Grin and Whitechapel. In the 2010s, deathcore bands began experimenting with an eccentric selection of other genres. The genre is noted for its criticism from longtime fans of heavy metal music, usually for its frequent use of breakdowns. Some deathcore musicians have even rejected the label. Characteristics Deathcore combines death metal characteristics such as blast beats, down-tuned guitars, tremolo picking, and growled vocals with metalcore characteristics such as breakdowns. The genre is usually defined by breakdowns and death metal riffs or metalcore riffs played in the usual death metal tuning. Like in other extreme metal fusion genres, deathcore guitarists down-tune their guitars to give their music a heavier sound. Deathcore bands may also employ guitar solos as well. Low growls and shrieked screams are common types of vocals in deathcore. Some other techniques that deathcore vocalists have used include what is known as pig squeals. Sung vocals in the genre are rare and most bands seldom if ever use them, but the idea has been experimented with by a few bands such as All Shall Perish (in the song \\"Awaken the Dreamers\\") and Oceano (in the song \\"Incisions\\"). History =Predecessors (1990s)= Suffocation The term deathcore was first used in reference to the style of music played by New York hardcore punk band N.Y.C. Mayhem in the mid‚Äì1980s. By 1996, Nick Terry of Terrorizer magazine wrote: \\"We're probably going to settle on the term deathcore to describe the likes of Earth Crisis (as well as the more NYHC-ish but still as deathly Merauder).\\"Terry, Nick (December 1996). \\"So, Did Earth Crisis Move You?\\". Terrorizer #37, page 23. . Embrace the Eternal (1998) by Embodyment and Rain in Endless Fall (1999) by Prayer for Cleansing are early examples of albums that feature a metalcore sound combined with death metal influences.Pelt, Doug Van (2004) . HM Magazine. Retrieved on May 11, 2016. Decibel magazine wrote that death metal band Suffocation were one of the main inspirations for the genre's emergence by writing: \\"One of Suffocation's trademarks, breakdowns, has spawned an entire metal subgenre: deathcore.\\" The Belgian H8000 music scene was also influential to the development of the sound, with bands like Deformity, and Liar helping to pioneer a prototype for the genre in the late‚Äì1990s and early‚Äì2000s. When writing about deathcore pioneers Despised Icon, Dom Lawson of Metal Hammer wrote: \\"blending death metal with hardcore was by no means a new thing when Despised Icon emerged.\\" Suffocation bassist Derek Boyer says Suffocation \\"were influenced by many early metal and hardcore bands\\". Death metal bands like Dying Fetus, Suffocation, and Internal Bleeding were influential on deathcore due to their use of \\"crushing, mid-paced grooves and breakdowns\\", according to Lawson. Despised Icon =Origins (early‚Äìmid 2000s)= AntagonyMetal Injection - Watch Dawn of Deathcore: The Story of Antagony For Maximum Deathcore History! and Despised Icon are considered to be the pioneers of deathcore, however both bands have rejected the label. Founder and frontman Nick Vasallo is credited as being the \\"father of deathcore\\" due to his work in Antagony. The Red Chord is referenced as an early influential source for the genre due to their hybridization of metalcore and death metal sounds (among other genres).Metal Blade artists New Hampshire band Deadwater Drowning and Californian group All Shall Perish are also seen as notable early entries of the genre. Deadwater Drowning's 2003 EP was remarked as \\"basically the blueprint for every current deathcore band out today,\\" while All Shall Perish's debut album Hate, Malice, Revenge (2003) is credited as one of the first purist deathcore albums as it \\"never got tied down to [simply] death metal or metalcore.\\" In the mid 2000s, deathcore spiked in popularity shortly after Job for a Cowboy released their EP Doom in 2005, which is heavily credited as one of deathcore‚Äôs most significant and influential releases for the genre. The genre saw an increase in popularity even further when English band Bring Me the Horizon released their deathcore debut full-length Count Your Blessings in 2006. The band were presented the 2006 Kerrang! Award for \\"Best British Newcomer\\" shortly after the album's release, however the band abandoned the deathcore genre soon after. Deathcore band Through the Eyes of the Dead emerged in the mid-2000s with the release of their 2005 album Bloodlust. =Expansion (late 2000s and early 2010s)= Mitch Lucker of Suicide Silence Deathcore began to gain further popularity in the mid to late 2000s and early 2010s. Suicide Silence's No Time to Bleed peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200, number 12 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 6 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart, while their album The Black Crown peaked at number 28 on the Billboard 200, number 7 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 3 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart. Whitechapel's album This Is Exile sold 5,900 in copies, which made it enter the Billboard 200 chart at position 118. Their self-titled album peaked at number 65 on the Canadian Albums Chart and also at number 47 on the Billboard 200. Their third album A New Era of Corruption sold about 10,600 copies in the United States in its first week of being released and peaked at position number 43 on the Billboard 200 chart. San Diego natives Carnifex, witnessed success with their first album Dead in My Arms, selling 5,000 copies with little publicity. On top of their non-stop touring, the band‚Äôs methodical songwriting resulted in Carnifex quickly getting signed to label Victory Records. Australian deathcore band Thy Art Is Murder debuted at number 35 on the ARIA Charts with their album Hate (2012) making them the first metal band to ever reach the Top 40 of this chart. Fusion with other genres  A variety of deathcore bands experimented with other genres into their music as influence and time progressed. Emmure has been credited to be heavily influenced by nu metal and was described as \\"the new Limp Bizkit\\". Suicide Silence's 2011 album The Black Crown is a deathcore album with some nu metal influences. Other examples of nu metal-inspired deathcore bands include Here Comes the Kraken's later material. The early 2010s saw bands fusing the genre with influences from djent and progressive metal, which began to achieve underground popularity. Examples of the aforementioned include Veil of Maya, Born of Osiris, and After the Burial. Some bands, such as Make Them Suffer and Winds of Plague, mix deathcore with symphonic/classical elements. French band Betraying the Martyrs has been described as \\"[the] punishing brutality of deathcore with melodic flourishes pulled from symphonic and progressive metal, giving it a theatricality that feels distinctly European.\\" Criticism Deathcore has been criticized and looked down upon, especially by longtime fans of other heavy metal subgenres. The reason for this is often its fusion of death metal with metalcore and use of breakdowns. In addition to this, members of certain deathcore bands do not take a liking to being labeled \\"deathcore\\". In an interview with vocalist Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain about the deathcore label, he said \\"Deathcore is the new nu-metal. [...] It sucks. And if anyone calls us 'deathcore' then I might do something very bad to them.\\" While in an interview with Justin Longshore from Through the Eyes of the Dead about the deathcore label, he said \\"You know, I really hate that term. I know we've been labeled as that but I think there's so much more to our music than just a mixture of death metal and hardcore (sic) even though we incorporate those elements in our music. To me it seems that is just the new and fresh thing that kids are following.\\" In November 2013, Terrorizer wrote \\"The term ‚Äòdeathcore‚Äô is usually seen as a dirty word in metal circles\\" while interviewing vocalist Bryce Lucien of the Texas-based metal band Seeker. Lucien then stated: In contrast, there seems to be bands that appear to be more lighthearted and less concerned over being described as deathcore.

Background  Candace Kucsulain, Apathemy's singer from 1996 to 1998, joined the band when it was founded. In April 1999 the band released their first EP, Underestimated, which was followed by a second EP, A Day and a Thousand Years, containing Underestimated and demo tracks, released on Florida-based Eulogy Recordings and later by European imprint Genet. After touring in support of the releases, the band was signed to Trustkill Records and released their debut full-length album The Bound Feed the Gagged in December 1999. After unsuccessful auditions to fill the vacant drummer position, the band went into hiatus. Shortly before this, lead vocalist Kucsulain entered a body piercing apprenticeship, which would occupy her free time over the next two years. Also during this time band members Hasty, Ruby and Rawson started a side project band called It's All Gone to Hell. Alexei Rodriguez joined the band, which began touring again April 2003. The band began writing new material and in September 2003 completed recording All Hail the Dead, which was released in February 2004. The album release garnered them support slots for other bands as well as headlining tours of their own. It was not long after the release that Rodriguez left the band. He was replaced by longtime friend Dustin Schoenhofer. They entered the studio in 2006 with producer Ben Schigel to start recording their third album, With Devils Amongst Us All, which was released in August. \\"A Trigger Full of Promises\\" was released as a its first single in April and was included on the MTV2 Headbangers Ball: The Revenge compilation CD. In October 2007 the band worked with Corey Taylor to produce Redemption, an acoustic-only EP which was released on April 29, 2008, via Trustkill. Taylor providing guest vocals on three of the five tracks. On July 29, 2008, the band released their fourth full-length studio album, The American Dream, that features a return to the band's previous style, and was produced once again by Ben Schigel. In early 2014, they released \\"Relentless\\" as a demo. They released No One Can Save You From Yourself on March 25, 2016, via Napalm Records.

The Ethical movement is an outgrowth of secular moral traditions in the 19th century, principally in Europe and the United States. While some in this movement went on to organise for a non-congregational secular humanist movement, others attempted to build a secular moral movement that was emphatically \\"religious\\" in its approach to developing humanist ethical codes, in the sense of encouraging congregational structures and religious rites and practices. While in the United States, these movements formed as separate education organisations (the American Humanist Association and the American Ethical Union), the American Ethical Union's British equivalents, the South Place Ethical Society and the British Ethical Union consciously moved away from a congregational model to become Conway Hall and Humanists UK respectively. Subsequent \\"godless\\" congregational movements include the Sunday Assembly, whose London chapter has used Conway Hall as a venue since 2013. At the international level, Ethical Culture and secular humanist groups have always organised jointly; the American Ethical Union and British Ethical Union were founding members of Humanists International, whose original name \\"International Humanist and Ethical Union\\" reflected the movement's unity. Ethical Culture is premised on the idea that honoring and living in accordance with ethical principles is central to what it takes to live meaningful and fulfilling lives, and to creating a world that is good for all. Practitioners of Ethical Culture focus on supporting one another in becoming better people, and on doing good in the world. History =Background= The Ethical movement was an outgrowth of the general loss of faith among the intellectuals of the Victorian era. A precursor to the doctrines of the ethical movement can be found in the South Place Ethical Society, founded in 1793 as the South Place Chapel on Finsbury Square, on the edge of the City of London.City of London page on Finsbury Circus Conservation Area Character Summary The Fabian Society was an outgrowth from the Fellowship of the New Life. In the early nineteenth century, the chapel became known as \\"a radical gathering-place\\".The Sexual Contract, by Carole Patema. P160 At that point it was a Unitarian chapel, and that movement, like Quakers, supported female equality. Under the leadership of Reverend William Johnson Fox, it lent its pulpit to activists such as Anna Wheeler, one of the first women to campaign for feminism at public meetings in England, who spoke in 1829 on \\"Rights of Women.\\" In later decades, the chapel moved away from Unitarianism, changing its name first to the South Place Religious Society, then the South Place Ethical Society (a name it held formally, though it was better known as Conway Hall from 1929) and is now Conway Hall Ethical Society. The Fellowship of the New Life was established in 1883 by the Scottish intellectual Thomas Davidson. Fellowship members included poets Edward Carpenter and John Davidson, animal rights activist Henry Stephens Salt,George Hendrick, Henry Salt: Humanitarian Reformer and Man of Letters, University of Illinois Press, pg. 47 (1977). sexologist Havelock Ellis, feminist Edith Lees (who later married Ellis), novelist Olive SchreinerJeffrey Weeks, Making Sexual History, Wiley-Blackwell, pg. 20, (2000). and Edward R. Pease. Its objective was \\"The cultivation of a perfect character in each and all.\\" They wanted to transform society by setting an example of clean simplified living for others to follow. Davidson was a major proponent of a structured philosophy about religion, ethics, and social reform.Knight, William. Memorials of Thomas Davidson.(Boston: Ginn & Company, 1907), 18 At a meeting on 16 November 1883, a summary of the society's goals was drawn up by Maurice Adams: Although the Fellowship was a short-lived organization, it spawned the Fabian Society, which split in 1884 from the Fellowship of the New Life.William A. Knight, Memorials of Thomas Davidson: The Wandering Scholar (Boston and London: Ginn and Co, 1907). p. 16, 19, 46. =Ethical movement= Felix Adler, founder of the ethical movement. In his youth, Felix Adler was being trained to be a rabbi like his father, Samuel Adler, the rabbi of the Reform Jewish Temple Emanu-El in New York. As part of his education, he enrolled at the University of Heidelberg, where he was influenced by neo-Kantian philosophy. He was especially drawn to the Kantian ideas that one could not prove the existence or non-existence of deities or immortality and that morality could be established independently of theology.Howard B. Radest. 1969. Toward Common Ground: The Story of the Ethical Societies in the United States. New York: Fredrick Unger Publishing Co. During this time he was also exposed to the moral problems caused by the exploitation of women and labor. These experiences laid the intellectual groundwork for the ethical movement. Upon his return from Germany, in 1873, he shared his ethical vision with his father's congregation in the form of a sermon. Due to the negative reaction he elicited it became his first and last sermon as a rabbi in training.Colin Campbell. 1971. Towards a Sociology of Irreligion. London: MacMillan Press. Instead he took up a professorship at Cornell University and in 1876 gave a follow up sermon that led to the 1877 founding of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, which was the first of its kind. By 1886, similar societies had sprouted up in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis. These societies all adopted the same statement of principles: *The belief that morality is independent of theology; *The affirmation that new moral problems have arisen in modern industrial society which have not been adequately dealt with by the world's religions; *The duty to engage in philanthropy in the advancement of morality; *The belief that self-reform should go in lock step with social reform; *The establishment of republican rather than monarchical governance of Ethical societies *The agreement that educating the young is the most important aim. In effect, the movement responded to the religious crisis of the time by replacing theology with unadulterated morality. It aimed to \\"disentangle moral ideas from religious doctrines, metaphysical systems, and ethical theories, and to make them an independent force in personal life and social relations.\\" Adler was also particularly critical of the religious emphasis on creed, believing it to be the source of sectarian bigotry. He therefore attempted to provide a universal fellowship devoid of ritual and ceremony, for those who would otherwise be divided by creeds. For the same reasons the movement also adopted a neutral position on religious beliefs, advocating neither atheism nor theism, agnosticism nor deism. Ethical Culture School (red) and Ethical Culture Society (white) buildings. The Adlerian emphasis on \\"deed not creed\\" translated into several public service projects. The year after it was founded, the New York society started a kindergarten, a district nursing service and a tenement-house building company. Later they opened the Ethical Culture School, then called the \\"Workingman's School,\\" a Sunday school and a summer home for children, and other Ethical societies soon followed suit with similar projects. Unlike the philanthropic efforts of the established religious institutions of the time, the Ethical societies did not attempt to proselytize those they helped. In fact, they rarely attempted to convert anyone. New members had to be sponsored by existing members, and women were not allowed to join at all until 1893. They also resisted formalization, though nevertheless slowly adopted certain traditional practices, like Sunday meetings and life cycle ceremonies, yet did so in a modern humanistic context. In 1893, the four existing societies unified under the umbrella organization, the American Ethical Union. After some initial success the movement stagnated until after World War II. In 1946 efforts were made to revitalize and societies were created in New Jersey and Washington D.C., along with the inauguration of the Encampment for Citizenship. By 1968 there were thirty societies with a total national membership of over 5,500. However, the resuscitated movement differed from its predecessor in a few ways. The newer groups were being created in suburban locales and often to provide alternative Sunday schools for children, with adult activities as an afterthought. There was also a greater focus on organization and bureaucracy, along with an inward turn emphasizing the needs of the group members over the more general social issues that had originally concerned Adler. The result was a transformation of American ethical societies into something much more akin to small Christian congregations in which the minister's most pressing concern is to tend to his or her flock. In the 21st century, the movement continued to revitalize itself through social media and involvement with other Humanist organizations, with mixed success. As of 2014, there were fewer than 10,000 official members of the Ethical movement.Stedman, Chris (1 October 2014). \\"The original 'atheist church': Why don‚Äôt more atheists know about Ethical Culture?\\" Religion World News. Retrieved from https://religionnews.com/2014/10/01/original-atheist- church-dont-atheists-know-ethical-culture/ =In Britain= Stanton Coit led the ethical movement in Britain. In 1885 the ten-year-old American Ethical Culture movement helped to stimulate similar social activity in Great Britain, when American sociologist John Graham Brooks distributed pamphlets by Chicago ethical society leader William Salter to a group of British philosophers, including Bernard Bosanquet, John Henry Muirhead, and John Stuart MacKenzie. One of Felix Adler's colleagues, Stanton Coit, visited them in London to discuss the \\"aims and principles\\" of their American counterparts. In 1886 the first British ethical society was founded. Coit took over the leadership of South Place for a few years. Ethical societies flourished in Britain. By 1896 the four London societies formed the Union of Ethical Societies, and between 1905 and 1910 there were over fifty societies in Great Britain, seventeen of which were affiliated with the Union. Part of this rapid growth was due to Coit, who left his role as leader of South Place in 1892 after being denied the power and authority he was vying for. Because he was firmly entrenched in British ethicism, Coit remained in London and formed the West London Ethical Society, which was almost completely under his control. Coit worked quickly to shape the West London society not only around Ethical Culture but also the trappings of religious practice, renaming the society in 1914 to the Ethical Church. He transformed his meetings into services, and their space into something akin to a church. In a series of books Coit also began to argue for the transformation of the Anglican Church into an Ethical Church, while holding up the virtue of ethical ritual. He felt that the Anglican Church was in the unique position to harness the natural moral impulse that stemmed from society itself, as long as the Church replaced theology with science, abandoned supernatural beliefs, expanded its bible to include a cross-cultural selection of ethical literature and reinterpreted its creeds and liturgy in light of modern ethics and psychology. His attempt to reform the Anglican church failed, and ten years after his death in 1944, the Ethical Church building was sold to the Roman Catholic Church. During Stanton Coit's lifetime, the Ethical Church never officially affiliated with the Union of Ethical Societies, nor did South Place. In 1920 the Union of Ethical Societies changed its name to the Ethical Union.I.D. MacKillop. 1986. The British Ethical Societies. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Harold Blackham, who had taken over leadership of the London Ethical Church, consciously sought to remove the church-like trappings of the Ethical movement, and advocated a simple creed of humanism that was not akin to a religion. He promoted the merger of the Ethical Union with the Rationalist Press Association and the South Place Ethical Society, and, in 1957, a Humanist Council was set up to explore amalgamation. Although issues over charitable status prevented a full amalgamation, the Ethical Union under Blackham changed its name in 1967 to become the British Humanist Association - establishing humanism as the principle organising force for non-religious morals and secularist advocacy in Britain. The BHA was the legal successor body to the Union of Ethical Societies.British Humanist Association: Our History since 1896 Between 1886 and 1927 seventy-four ethical societies were started in Great Britain, although this rapid growth did not last long. The numbers declined steadily throughout the 1920s and early 30s, until there were only ten societies left in 1934. By 1954 there were only four. The situation became such that in 1971, sociologist Colin Campbell even suggested that one could say, \\"that when the South Place Ethical Society discussed changing its name to the South Place Humanist society in 1969, the English ethical movement ceased to exist.\\" The organisations spawned by the 19th century Ethical movement would later live on as the British humanist movement. The South Place Ethical Society eventually changed its name Conway Hall Ethical Society, after Moncure D. Conway, and is typically known as simply \\"Conway Hall\\". In 2017, the British Humanist Association again changed its name, becoming Humanists UK. Both organisations are part of Humanists International, which had been founded by Harold Blackham in 1952 as the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Ethical perspective Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture building on Prospect Park West, originally designed by architect William Tubby as a home for William H. Childs (inventor of Bon Ami Cleaning Powder) While Ethical Culturists generally share common beliefs about what constitutes ethical behavior and the good, individuals are encouraged to develop their own personal understanding of these ideas. This does not mean that Ethical Culturists condone moral relativism, which would relegate ethics to mere preferences or social conventions. Ethical principles are viewed as being related to deep truths about the way the world works, and hence not arbitrary. However, it is recognized that complexities render the understanding of ethical nuances subject to continued dialogue, exploration, and learning. While the founder of Ethical Culture, Felix Adler, was a transcendentalist, Ethical Culturists may have a variety of understandings as to the theoretical origins of ethics. Key to the founding of Ethical Culture was the observation that too often disputes over religious or philosophical doctrines have distracted people from actually living ethically and doing good. Consequently, \\"Deed before creed\\" has long been a motto of the movement.The conservator, Volumes 3-4, Horace Traubel, Volume 3, page 31Ethics as a Religion, David Saville Muzzey, 273 pages, 1951, 1967, 1986  Organisational model  Pews and stained glass Functionally, the Ethical Societies were organised in a similar manner to churches or synagogues and are headed by \\"leaders\\" as clergy. Their founders had suspected this would be a successful model for spreading secular morality. As a result, an Ethical Society typically would have Sunday morning meetings, offer moral instruction for children and teens, and do charitable work and social action. They may offer a variety of educational and other programs. They conduct weddings, commitment ceremonies, baby namings, and memorial services. Individual Ethical Society members may or may not believe in a deity or regard Ethical Culture as their religion. Felix Adler said \\"Ethical Culture is religious to those who are religiously minded, and merely ethical to those who are not so minded.\\" The movement does consider itself a religion in the sense that The Ethical Culture 2003 ethical identity statement states: Since around 1950 the Ethical Culture movement has been increasingly identified as part of the modern Humanist movement. Specifically, in 1952, the American Ethical Union, the national umbrella organization for Ethical Culture societies in the United States, became one of the founding member organizations of the International Humanist and Ethical Union. In the United Kingdom, the ethical societies consciously rejected the \\"church model\\" in the mid-20th century, while still providing services like weddings, funerals, and namings on a secular basis. Key ideas While Ethical Culture does not regard its founder's views as necessarily the final word, Adler identified focal ideas that remain important within Ethical Culture. These ideas include: * Human Worth and Uniqueness ‚Äì All people are taken to have inherent worth, not dependent on the value of what they do. They are deserving of respect and dignity, and their unique gifts are to be encouraged and celebrated. * Eliciting the Best ‚Äì \\"Always act so as to Elicit the best in others, and thereby yourself\\" is as close as Ethical Culture comes to having a Golden Rule. * Interrelatedness ‚Äì Adler used the term The Ethical Manifold to refer to his conception of the universe as made up of myriad unique and indispensable moral agents (individual human beings), each of whom has an inestimable influence on all the others. In other words, we are all interrelated, with each person playing a role in the whole and the whole affecting each person. Our interrelatedness is at the heart of ethics. Many Ethical Societies prominently display a sign that says \\"The Place Where People Meet to Seek the Highest is Holy Ground\\". Locations The largest concentration of Ethical Societies is in the New York metropolitan area, including Societies in New York, Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Westchester and Nassau County; and New Jersey, such as Bergen and Essex Counties, New Jersey.Ethical Societies.Bergen, NJ Society Ethical Societies exist in several U.S. cities and counties, including Austin, Texas; Baltimore; Chapel Hill; Asheville, North Carolina; Chicago; San Jose, California; Philadelphia; St. Louis; St. Peters, Missouri; Washington, D.C.; Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and Vienna, Virginia. Ethical Societies also exist outside the U.S. Conway Hall in London is home to the South Place Ethical Society, which was founded in 1787.South Place Ethical Society, About the Society . Structure and events Ethical societies are typically led by \\"Leaders.\\" Leaders are trained and certified (the equivalent of ordination) by the American Ethical Union. Societies engage Leaders, in much the same way that Protestant congregations \\"call\\" a minister. Not all Ethical societies have a professional Leader. (In typical usage, the Ethical Movement uses upper case to distinguish certified professional Leaders from other leaders.) A board of executives handles day-to-day affairs, and committees of members focus on specific activities and involvements of the society. Ethical societies usually hold weekly meetings on Sundays, with the main event of each meeting being the \\"Platform\\", which involves a half-hour speech by the Leader of the Ethical Society, a member of the society or by guests. Sunday school for minors is also held at most ethical societies concurrent with the Platform. The American Ethical Union holds an annual AEU Assembly bringing together Ethical societies from across the US. Legal challenges The tax status of Ethical Societies as religious organizations has been upheld in court cases in Washington, D.C. (1957), and in Austin, Texas (2003). In challenge to a denial of tax-exempt status, the Texas State Appeals Court decided that \\"the Comptroller's test was unconstitutionally underinclusive and that the Ethical Society should have qualified for the requested tax exemptions... Because the Comptroller's test fails to include the whole range of belief systems that may, in our diverse and pluralistic society, merit the First Amendment's protection...\\"Carole Keeton Strayhorn, in her Official Capacity as Comptroller of Public Accounts, Appellant v. Ethical Society of Austin, f/k/a Ethical Culture Fellowship of Austin, Appellee, justia.com, 2003 Advocates British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald was a strong supporter of the British Ethical movement, having been a Christian earlier in his life. He was a member of the Ethical Church and the Union of Ethical Societies (now Humanists UK), a regular attender at South Place Ethical Society. During his time involved with the Ethical movement, he chaired the annual meeting of the Ethical Union on multiple occasions and wrote for Stanton Coit's Ethical World journal.Marquand, David; Ramsay MacDonald; London, 1977; p. 24 The British critic and mountaineer Leslie Stephen was a prominent supporter of Ethical Culture in the UK, serving multiple terms as President of the West London Ethical Society (later part of the Union of Ethical Societies). Albert Einstein was a supporter of Ethical Culture. On the seventy-fifth anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, in 1951, he noted that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. Humanity requires such a belief to survive, Einstein argued. He observed, \\"Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.\\" First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was a regular attendee at the New York Society for Ethical Culture at a time when humanism was beginning to coalesce in its modern-day form, and it was there that she developed friendships with the leading humanists and Ethical Culturists of her day. She collaborated with Al Black, Ethical Society leader, in the creation of her nationwide Encampment of Citizenship. She maintained her involvement with the movement as figures on both sides of the Atlantic began to advocate for organising under the banner of secular humanism. She provided a cover endorsement for the first edition of Humanism as the Next Step (1954) by Lloyd and Mary Morain, saying simply that it was \\"A significant book.\\" See also * Arthur E.

On 24 October 1911 a Nieuport IVG, flown for the Italian Army Air Corps in North Africa by Capitano Moizo, made the second-ever reconnaissance flight by a military aeroplane, and perhaps the first bombing run. A Nieuport monoplane, flown by Weymann, won the French Military Aircraft trials competition held in October and November 1911.

His aircraft were all monoplanes, not the biplanes for which the company became famous during the First World War. His monoplanes were sold throughout Europe, and involved in many other aviation firsts: *The first round trip over the Mediterranean in 1913, flown by Lieutenants Destrem and de l'Escaille of the Marine Nationale from St. Rafael to Ajaccio in Corsica and back. *A world altitude record of 20,079 ft (6,120 m) by Georges Legagneux, also at St. Raphael. *An epic seven-week flight from Villacoublay to Cairo by pilot Marc Bonnier and a passenger. *Some of the very first tests of machine- gun mounting on aircraft. *The first ever successful loop, performed by Lieutenant Pyotr Nesterov of the Imperial Russian Air Service on 20 August 1913.

History ETV started in late 1991 as a branch of Mirco-Wave Communication Systems (Private) Limited (MCS) (Sri Lanka Registrar of Companies # NPVS9093). MCS was a subsidiary of East-West Enterpriseshttp://www.eastwest.lk and was the primary reason for the E in ETV (East West Television). The original board of MCS and Later ETV consisted of 4 persons - namely, Nahil Wijesuriya,http://www.echelon.lk/ipg/in-the-home-of- nahil-wijesuriya/ Captain Lester Weinman,http://www.ft.lk/article/572660/Sri- Lanka-Shipping-Chief-briefs-shareholders-on-plight-of-Avant- Gardehttp://www.srilankashipping.com/aboutusprofile.php Uoosoof Mohideenhttps://archive.li/20070927230435/http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=249&lugradecode;=MH&showall;=1http://www.companiesnz.com/person/337247/uoosoof- mohideenhttps://www.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/service/services/documents/419FE18AEDCD0A819D0E3900911EBBF9 and Priyanke de Silva.https://www.abelcanada.com/pcref/board_members.phphttps://abelcanada.com/msc/msc_about.phphttp://www.drc.gov.lk/App/comreg.nsf?Open These four names are in the registrar of companies register for both ETV and Micro-Wave communication systems. Incidentally, Nahil's alma-mater is Trinity College, Kandy while the other three studied at St. Peter's College, Colombo 4. The logo of ETV depicted in this article (and has the colours of East West Enterprises) was designed by Nahil Wijesuriya in his office at the Robert Senanayake Building in Nawam Mawatha, Colombo 2. Priyanke (Anthonus) de Silva (Priyanke Research)Ice Wireless#History met Uoosoof Mohideen at the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologieshttp://www.accimt.ac.lk/ in August 1990. Priyanke and Uoosoof became friends and it was Uoosoof who invited Priyanke to join MCS as a Consultant Engineer for ETV, which was headed at that time by Mr. Roshan Rupesinghe. Soon after joining, Roshan Rupesinghe migrated to Australia at which point Nahil invited Priyanke to be the CEO/Managing Director of MCS. ETV microwave transmitter at 'East-West Properties' at Peliyagoda, Sri Lanka in (under) the 50foot concrete dish. The transmitter was broken into two parts with the head-end on the transmitting tower (antenna) on Priyanke's advice. Draft minutes of a board meeting held with 3 (Nahil, Uoosoof and Priyanke) of the 4 members present at Robert Senanayake Building, Nawam Mw., Colombo 2. Programming for ETV was by down linking AsiaSat1 programs by a 50-foot diameter concrete dish built by Nahil (for which he owned a patent) at an East-West property in Peliyagoda, Sri Lanka. The AsiaSat1 signal was very weak (approx -19db to -23db) and the 50-foot dish enabled ETV to provide 'broadcast quality' programs. Incidentally, MCS sold self-manufactured glass-fibre dishes of 16-foot diameter for residential use (including hotels). A microwave, line-of-sight, link from Peliyagoda to Station Rd, Colombo 4 (SET building) fed the content to the broadcasting studio/station on the 17th floor of the SET building. During this period East-West Enterprises split into two entities and Captain Lester Weinman and Mr. Nahil Wijesuriya went separate ways with Lester getting control of the Robert Senanayake Building and Nahil getting the IBM Building (Thaakshana Mandiraya) in Navam Mawatha, Colombo 2 and Nahil got total control of MCS and ETV. Nahil moved his office to the Thaakshana Mandiraya (IBM building). Uoosoof Mohideen is/was the CNN representative for Sri Lanka and later joined Dynavision Broadcasting Corporation re-branded as ART TV as CEO upon exiting from MCS/ETV. Incidentally, Priyanke did some ground work for CNN during this time on measuring the CNN signal quality, etc. Priyanke also exited ETV and MCS, before Uoosoof's exit and the primary reason was that he wanted to go back to concentrating on his core business and other ventures, including as a technology consultant for another East-West (Nahil) owned enterprise. Nahil continued on with ETV and later sold ETV to EAP Holdings.

Hosted mainly by Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Ng·∫°n and Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ Duy√™n, the series includes musical performances by modern pop stars, traditional folk songs, one-act plays, and sketch comedy.  Background  Paris By Night was conceived by immigrant T√¥ VƒÉn Lai in 1983, in Paris, France, to \\"fill the cultural void\\" as a result of fleeing Vietnam in the Vietnam War. Shortly afterwards, the show's production company transferred to Orange County, California, which has a large Vietnamese community.  Themes  The show is set up with \\"melodramatic performances, catchy pop tunes, Vaudeville-esque comedy, and elaborate set designs\\", with a large emphasis of production focusing on expressing Vietnamese culture. In recent years, the rising popularity of K-pop and J-pop has applied creative pressure to Th√∫y Nga CEO Marie T√¥, who responded by insisting on keeping with the Vietnamese style, commenting \\"Of course, K-pop is very big now‚Ä¶but we kind of want to create our own image. The singer[s] we produce, we want to create their image‚Äînot imitating K-pop or anything.\\" The show has since been noted as not only a form of entertainment, but a \\"way to connect to a larger identity\\".  Production  = Crew = While most of the staff and crew remain the same from show to show, the directors may vary based on the filming location. For example, Richard Valverde served as director for shows in Paris, Michael Watt directed shows in Canada and the United States, and Victor Fable directed in the United States. Notable directors include The Voice's Alan Carter, who directed six shows in the United States, CEO of production company A. Smith & Co. Kent Weed, of six shows in the United States, and NBC director Ron de Moraes who directed four shows. Starting with Paris by Night 34: Made in Paris, Shanda Sawyer has been working as the production's main choreographer. = Filming = Originally, Paris by Night was filmed exclusively in Paris, with its intended target audience consisting of the Vietnamese population in France. However, by the late 1980s, the production moved to Orange County, California (specifically James Irvine Intermediate), as a result of demand from the more populous Vietnamese American community for the production to host shows in the United States and the fact that most Vietnamese language performers from the former South Vietnam lived in the country, with filming beginning in the country in the mid-1990s. With the exception of two shows, Paris by Night has been filmed live before an audience. The show has since been filmed in France, the United States, Canada, South Korea and Singapore. = Video release = Since the beginning of the show's run, the producers have been releasing videos of the shows on VHS and, more recently, DVD. Since the digital age, however, Paris by Night sales have dropped significantly, and the company has since switched to a video on demand service and a subscription services similar to Netflix. Full shows and music clips have been made on the official Th√∫y Nga YouTube channel, supported with ad revenue. The company has also allowed IP addresses in Vietnam to stream shows for free, countering the country's ban on the show's sales. Production coordinator John Nguyen states ‚ÄúAll the copies in Vietnam are bootleg or through illegal downloads.\\"  Demographics  When first produced in the 1980s, the show was made for Vietnamese people who had been living in France in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the show found a larger audience in the United States by the late 1980s. As a result of the digital age of the 21st century, the show has become more readily accessible online. According to Th√∫y Nga, the main demographic of the shows consisted of people under the age of 40. Presenter Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ Duy√™n commented on the show's popularity in Vietnam, noting \\"We actually give the Vietnamese audience in Vietnam a very high level of entertainment unmatched by what they have now.\\"  Controversies  As an overseas Vietnamese production and classified as a \\"reactionary cultural product\\" by the Vietnamese government, Paris by Night cannot be legally purchased in Vietnam, although unauthorized copies can be easily obtained in the black market. It sometimes features performances that are related to historical events, critical of the ruling Vietnamese Communist Party. In 2004, in Paris by Night 74, Hoang Oanh sang a song about Operation Passage to Freedom and a video montage was shown depicting beleaguered-looking northern Vietnamese fleeing to the anti-communist south during the partition of Vietnam, where they were met by Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám and his government's officials. This performance coincided with the 50th anniversary of the migration. In 2005, Paris by Night 77 was devoted to the 30-year anniversary of the Fall of Saigon, and included songs explicitly critical of communist rule, lack of human rights, accompanied by montages of the closing stages of the Ho Chi Minh Campaign, the flight of distressed anti-communist refugees, and interpretative dancing critical of VCP rule, such as throat-slitting gestures. It also included documentary segments on the progress of Vietnamese immigrant communities since 1975, including one segment praising American support for South Vietnam and Operation Babylift‚Äîthe communist government views the babylift of orphans as \\"abduction\\"‚Äîand gave awards to Vietnamese humanitarians and American political officials who helped Vietnamese refugees, as well as the Republic of Vietnam Air Force fighter pilot Nguy·ªÖn Q√∫y An. In Paris by Night 91, for the 40th anniversary of the Tet Offensive, one medley involved Quang L√™ singing about the beauty of the former Hu·∫ø, backed by female dancers, before an explosion knocks them and the bridge over the Perfume River to the ground, something perpetrated by the communists during the Battle of Hu·∫ø during the Tet Offensive. Kh√°nh Ly then proceeded to sing Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n's \\"Song for dead bodies\\" about the communist massacre at Hu·∫ø, which killed thousands. A video montage of the massacre, inconsolable relatives and the subsequent exhumation and religious reburial was shown in the background during Khanh Ly's performance. It is also the subject of some controversies among the overseas Vietnamese population due to what some perceive as its support of the current government of Vietnam. Paris by Night 40, with the topic of motherhood, featured a song by the composer Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n titled \\"Ca Dao Me\\", which was performed by Don H·ªì. The song included a reenactment of a bombing during the Vietnam War and showed a mother grieving over the death of her child and her husband. Some were offended by the song's antiwar message while others see this as an indictment against American and South Vietnamese troops even though the scene did not make it clear which side was doing the bombing. After a boycott, Th√∫y Nga reissued Paris by Night 40 with the bombing scenes removed. Paris by Night 40 is the most commercially successful production. The director of the segment, L∆∞u Hu·ª≥nh, later went on to direct The White Silk Dress in Vietnam, a film with similar themes. In Paris by Night 96, Th√∫y Nga Productions's Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Ng·∫°n wrote a skit about a Vietnamese American gay kid, starring Bang Kieu. This sparked conversations among Vietnamese American parents and their gay children. It helped build more tolerance for Vietnamese American gay lesbian bisexual and transgender community overseas. This shows the company's cultural influence over the Vietnamese American culture, experience and audience. There has also been increasing recent criticism of the production over-Americanizing its shows, with traditional Vietnamese culture and aspects no longer being emphasized as before, as well as the production largely losing its original French cabaret influence and roots. In fact, Paris by Night has not been filmed in its namesake city since 2003, Paris by Night 70.

He played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball, playing at every position, including 585 games at second base, 544 games in the outfield, and 178 games at third base. Richardson played for six major league teams, with his longest stretches having been for the Buffalo Bisons (1879‚Äì85), Detroit Wolverines (1886‚Äì88) and Boston Reds (1890‚Äì91). Richardson appeared in 1,331 major league games, compiled a .299 batting average and .435 slugging percentage, and totaled 1,120 runs scored, 1,688 hits, 303 doubles, 126 triples, 70 home runs, 822 RBIs, and 377 bases on balls. From 1881 to 1888, he was part of the \\"Big Four\\", a group of renowned batters (the others being Dan Brouthers, Jack Rowe, and Deacon White) who played together in Buffalo and Detroit and led Detroit to the National League pennant and 1887 World Series championship. Early years Richardson was born in 1855 at Clarksboro, which is located in the existing municipality of East Greenwich Township, New Jersey. His father, Robert D. Richardson, was a New Jersey native who worked in 1870 as a house carpenter. His mother, Naomi (Jones) Richardson, was a Pennsylvania native.1860 U.S. Census entry for Robert and Naomi Richardson.

Ancestry.com. 1870 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Professional baseball player =Minor leagues= Richardson began playing organized baseball with semipro teams in South Jersey and Philadelphia in the early 1870s. In 1875, he played at third base and catcher for the Gloucester City, New Jersey club. For a portion of the 1876 season, he played with the Philadelphias, but that team disbanded in July 1876. Richardson next played for the \\"Crickets\\" from Binghamton, New York, during the 1876 and 1877 seasons. In 1878, he played for the Utica, New York club in the International Association for Professional Base Ball Players. While playing for Utica, the New York Clipper called him the best fielding center fielder in baseball; he also won \\"The Clipper medal for best fielding average.\\" =Buffalo= Richardson joined the Buffalo Bisons of the National League in 1879 and remained with Buffalo for seven years from 1879 to 1885. 1879 to 1882 seasons As a rookie, Richardson made his major league debut on May 1, 1879, and promptly became Buffalo's starting third baseman. He compiled a .283 batting average, earned a 2.5 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating, and ranked fifth in the National League with 10 triples and fourth with 16 bases on balls. He also led the league's third basemen in games played (78), double plays turned (13), and errors (44), and ranked second at the position in assists (153), putouts (83), and fielding percentage (.843). In 1880, Richardson was again positioned at third base. He saw his batting average drop to .259 and his WAR rating drop to 1.1. He still hit for power and ranked among the league leaders with eight triples (10th) and 26 extra base hits (10th). Defensively, his performance suffered as he ranked second among the league's third basemen with 47 errors and saw his Defensive WAR rating dip into negative territory at -0.7. After a poor defensive performance in 1880, Richardson was moved to the outfield in 1881. With the move, his batting average jumped to .291, and his WAR rating bounced back to 2.5 -- 10th best among the league's position players. Showing good power, he ranked among the league leaders with nine triples (3rd), 53 RBIs (4th), 29 extra base hits (9th), 62 runs scored (10th), 100 hits (10th), and 142 total bases (10th). The move to the outfield also suited Richardson defensively. He led the league's outfielders with 45 assists and a range factor of 2.84 and ranked third with 179 putouts. Richardson's total of 45 outfield assists (in only 79 games at the position) was five short of Orator Shafer's major league record and remains the third highest season total in major league history. In 1882, and despite his solid defensive performance in the outfield, Richardson switched positions for the second time in as many years. This time, he was moved to second base, where he played 83 games. Richardson handled the move reasonably well, as he led the league's second basemen with 275 putouts and ranked second with a 6.69 range factor and 63 errors. He also hit .271, earned a 2.2 WAR rating and ranked fourth in the league with 57 RBIs. The \\"Big Four\\" From 1881 to 1888, Richardson was one of four Buffalo (later Detroit) infielders with Dan Brouthers, Jack Rowe, and Deacon White who were known in baseball as the \\"Big Four.\\" The \\"Big Four\\" played together for eight years and were \\"regarded for many years as the greatest quartette in the history of the national pastime.\\" The Sporting News later wrote; \\"How the Big Four was admired! Even in hostile cities the fans praised them in the next breath after they had jeered them.\\" Richardson remained the Bisons' second baseman in 1883, playing all 92 of his games at the position. His 4.1 WAR rating in 1883 was the second highest in his career and the ninth highest among the National League's position players. He ranked among the league leaders with a .311 batting average (10th), .347 on-base percentage (9th), 34 doubles (5th), 42 extra base hits (9th), and 146 times on base (9th). Defensively, he led the league's second basemen with a career high 6.88 range factor, and ranked second at the position in assists (344) and putouts (289). However, he also ranked second at the position with a career high 68 errors. In a game against Philadelphia on July 20, 1883, both Richardson and Jack Rowe were credited with home runs when outfielder Conny Doyle was unable to find balls they hit into a patch of deep of grass in the left field corner.Bill James, The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, p. 511. During the 1884 season, Richardson played 71 games at second base and 24 in the outfield, as the \\"Big Four\\" led Buffalo to a third place finish and a 64‚Äì47 (.577) record ‚Äì the highest winning percentage in the club's history. All four players had outstanding seasons, combining for an 18.6 WAR rating. The chart below tracks the WAR rating of the \\"Big Four\\" during their eight seasons together. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\" width=\\"15%\\"  Year ! bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\" width=\\"16%\\"  Brouthers ! bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\" width=\\"16%\\"  Richardson ! bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\" width=\\"16%\\"  Rowe ! bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\" width=\\"16%\\"  White ! bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\" width=\\"16%\\"  Total WAR - align=\\"center\\"  1881 2.5 2.5 2.8 1.2 9.0 - align=\\"center\\"  1882 5.9 2.2 2.7 1.2 12.0 - align=\\"center\\"  1883 5.8 4.1 1.9 1.1 12.9 - align=\\"center\\"  1884 5.4 3.7 4.6 4.9 18.6 - align=\\"center\\"  1885 5.2 3.2 2.2 2.1 12.7 - align=\\"center\\"  1886 8.2 7.0 4.2 2.7 22.1 - align=\\"center\\"  1887 5.3 3.8 4.1 2.3 15.5 - align=\\"center\\"  1888 6.6 2.1 2.6 3.4 14.7 - align=\\"center\\"  Total 44.8 28.6 25.1 19.1117.6 } Richardson was involved in another unusual circumstance in a game against the Chicago White Stockings on August 13, 1884. Chicago's George Gore was instructed by player- manager Cap Anson to avoid the double play. When the next batter hit a ground ball, Gore tackled Richardson at second base before he could complete the relay throw. The umpire called both the batter and the runner out, and Anson protested the ruling and refused to resume play, leading the umpire to declare the game forfeited to Buffalo. The two teams then agreed to resume a game which had been postponed earlier in the season, as a way of placating the dissatisfied fans. In the later game, Anson decided to demonstrate of the right way to break up the double play. He reached first base, and when the next batter hit a ground ball to Richardson, Anson waved his arms while running to second in an effort to interfere with Richardson's throw. Possibly flustered by this display, Richardson in turn struck Anson square in the head with his throw, which was delivered hard enough that it bounced all the way into the grandstands. A woozy Anson was forced to leave the game. During the 1885 season, Richardson split his time between second base (50 games) and outfield (48 games), and even appeared in one game as a pitcher ‚Äì compiling a 2.25 earned run average in four innings pitched. He ranked among the league leaders with a .319 batting average (4th), .458 slugging percentage (4th), 11 triples (7th), six home runs (7th), 195 total bases (7th), 90 runs scored (8th), and 3.9 Offensive WAR rating (8th). =Detroit= Richardson, c. 1887, in Detroit uniform In mid-September 1885, the Detroit Wolverines purchased the \\"Big Four\\" from Buffalo, paying $7,000 for entire team. League officials initially halted the sale, but ultimately allowed it to proceed, provided the Big Four did not play for Detroit until the start of the 1886 season. Richardson responded to threats to void the transaction by saying that the \\"Big Four\\" would \\"retire to Canada\\". The merger of the Detroit and Buffalo line-ups turned two losing teams (Buffalo was 38-74 in 1885, Detroit 41-67) into one of the best in the game. With the addition of the \\"Big Four\\", the Wolverines improved substantially, finishing in second place with an 85-38 record. For Richardson, the 1886 season was the best of his career with a 7.0 WAR rating ‚Äì the fourth highest among the National League's position players. He led the league with 189 hits and 11 home runs and was among the league leaders with a .351 batting average (5th), .402 on-base percentage (6th), .504 slugging percentage (4th), 125 runs scored (4th), 271 total bases (3rd), 27 doubles (7th), 11 triples (8th), 49 extra base hits (4th), and 42 stolen bases (4th). He also had the second highest ratio of at bats to strikeouts at 48.9. Defensively, Richardson played at multiple positions during the 1886 season, including 80 games in the outfield, 42 at second base, and four as a pitcher (12 innings, 4.50 ERA). The 1887 season was the pinnacle in the eight-year history of the Detroit Wolverines. The team won the National League pennant with a 79-45 record and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. In an article published in 1911, Richardson called the 1887 Detroit team \\"one of the grandest collection of hitters ever seen together.\\" Richardson contributed another strong season, splitting his playing time between second base (64 games) and outfield (59 games), and compiling a 3.8 WAR rating. He was again among the league leaders with a .328 batting average (6th), 131 runs scored (3rd), 178 hits (3rd), 263 total bases (3rd), 18 triples (6th), 94 RBIs (7th), and 51 extra base hits (9th). Despite playing only 64 games at the position, he also led the league's second basemen with a 6.78 range factor. During the 1888 season, the Wolverines finished in fifth place with a 68-63 record. Richardson's playing time was limited to 58 games at second base, and his batting average and WAR rating to .289 and 2.1 ‚Äì Richardson's lowest numbers since 1880. With high salaries owed to the team's star players, and gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 with the players being sold to other teams. On October 16, 1888, the Wolverines sold Richardson along with Charlie Bennett, Dan Brouthers, Charlie Ganzel and Deacon White to the Boston Beaneaters for an estimated $30,000. =Boston= During the 1889 season, Richardson played for the Boston Beaneaters, appearing in 86 games as a second baseman and 46 as an outfielder. He compiled a .304 batting average and 3.9 WAR rating and ranked among the National League leaders with 122 runs scored (8th), 163 hits (9th), 47 stolen bases (8th), and 10 triples (10th). He also had the second highest range factor (6.47) among the league's second basemen. In his only season with the Beaneaters, he helped the team to a second place finish with an 83-45 record. In 1890, Richardson and teammate Dan Brouthers played in the newly-formed Players' League, joining the Boston Reds. The pair helped the Reds win the first and only Players' League pennant with an 81-48 record. Richardson was a strong supporter of the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. In January 1890, he spoke out against players like teammate John Clarkson who had joined the Brotherhood but remained with their old clubs. Richardson said he would remain loyal to the Players' League even if it could only pay him $10 a week and added: \\"I held up my hand and swore that I would stick to the brotherhood... I respect my word and regard my oath as sacred. You have no idea how hot it makes me to think of the way some of these players have acted.\\" Richardson played in the outfield for the Boston Players' League club, appearing in 124 games at the position. He compiled a .326 batting average in 1890 and led the Players' League with a career high of 146 RBIs. He also stole 42 bases and ranked among the league leaders with 13 home runs (2nd), 274 total bases (4th), 181 hits (5th), and 126 runs scored (10th). He also set a major league record in July 1890 by hitting home runs in five consecutive games, a record that was unmatched until Babe Ruth accomplished the feat in 1921. At the end of the 1890 season, the Players' League disbanded, but the Boston Reds remained a major league club in 1891 as part of the American Association. Richardson again played in the outfield for the 1891 Reds, but he was limited to 74 games, having been laid up at his home in Gloucester City, New Jersey, after suffering a broken bone in his foot.(\\"Hardy Richardson is still confined to his bed at Gloucester with a broken bone in his foot.\\") His batting average fell by 71 points to .255, and his WAR rating of 1.0 was the lowest of his career to that time. He did not rank among the American Association's leaders in any major offensive or defensive category, though he ranked second in the league with a ratio of 39.7 at bats per strikeout. =Washington and New York= Richardson played briefly for the Washington Senators in 1892. He appeared in 10 games, compiled a .108 batting average and was released by the Senators on April 28, 1892. Richardson was then signed by the New York Giants of the National League. He appeared in 64 games for the Giants, 33 of them at second base, and compiled a .214 batting average. He was released by the Giants late in the season, having appeared in his final major league game on September 10, 1892, at age 37. =1898 comeback= From May to June 1898, Richardson made a brief comeback at age 43 as a player for the Utica Pent-Ups in the New York State League. =Career statistics and legacy= In his 14 years in major league baseball, Richardson appeared in 1,331 major league games, compiled a .299 batting average and .435 slugging percentage, and totaled 1,120 runs scored, 1,688 hits, 303 doubles, 126 triples, 70 home runs, 822 RBIs, and 377 bases on balls. His best season was 1886 when he led the National League in home runs and compiled a 7.0 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating, the fourth highest among all position players in the National League. His career WAR rating was 40.5. In the 1894 Reach Guide to baseball, Jim Hart, who was Richardson's manager in 1889 with the Beaneaters, offered the following high opinion of Richardson: \\"I think Ed Williamson and Hardy Richardson would pretty nearly make a tie as to being the best ball player since professional base ball has existed.\\"Bill James, The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, p. 566 (quoting from the 1894 Reach Guide). Baseball historian Bill James in 2001 ranked Richardson as the 39th-best second baseman in the history of baseball in The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract. Family and later years In January 1886, Richardson was married in a ceremony at Utica, New York, to Lillie M. Davis. In reporting on the wedding, The Sporting News wrote: \\"Mr. Richardson's fame as a ball player extends from Maine to California, and is only surpassed by his genial gentlemanly bearing and manner, which have earned for him the best wishes of innumerable friends for his future happiness.\\" Richardson and his wife had a daughter, Dorothy, born in 1895. After retiring from baseball, Richardson reportedly operated a hotel in Utica, New York. By 1900, he was living in Utica with his wife, Lillie, and their daughter, Dorothy, and he was employed as an \\"art glass stainer.\\"1900 U.S. Census entry for Harding Richardson, born April 1849 in New Jersey, and Lillie M.

The lead character, Nucky Thompson, portrayed by Steve Buscemi, noted that he had owned an autographed catcher's mitt signed by Hardy Richardson when he was a child. It was stolen from him by older, bigger kids. After his father made him fight four older boys to get it back, Nucky was beaten unconscious and spent 11 days in the hospital.

The film was adapted for the screen by Edith Sommer, based on the novel Coins in the Fountain by John H. Secondari, and was directed by Jean Negulesco, who also directed the 1954 film Three Coins in the Fountain. Ann-Margret sings four songs composed by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen. The film was nominated for one Academy Award: Music (Scoring of Music‚ÄîAdaptation or Treatment) for Lionel Newman and Alexander Courage.  Plot summary  Three beautiful American women come to Madrid and fall in love. Susie Higgins (Pamela Tiffin) arrives and moves in with her old friend Maggie Williams (Carol Lynley) and roommate Fran Hobson (Ann-Margret). Susie experiences a culture shock, when she is informed by Maggie and Fran that all rich, attractive men are taken, and all attractive but poor ones are too proud to take on American women. It becomes clear to Susie that she is nothing like her roommates. Maggie, for instance, is a secretary who has recently ended an affair and is now in love with her married boss Paul Barton (Brian Keith), much to the dismay of her co-worker Pete McCoy (Gardner McKay), a newspaper man. Fran, an aspiring actress, flamenco dancer and singer, stumbles upon an attractive Spanish doctor Dr. Andres Briones (Andr√© Lawrence) and immediately falls for him, even though he does not seem to be interested. In contrast, Susie implies in conversation with her roommates that she is a virgin and tells them, \\"Don't spread it around!\\" While at the Museo del Prado, Susie catches the eye of wealthy playboy Emilio Lacayo (Anthony Franciosa). Homesick, she is comforted by the kind words of Emilio and dismisses Maggie's warnings that he is a \\"corrupt, heartless man.\\" During a party, where Fran delivers a musical performance, Susie is surprised by Emilio's interest in another girl and his lack of attention for her. Maggie is upset that a dance between her and Paul is interrupted by his jealous wife Jane (Gene Tierney). She asks Pete for a ride home and learns his plans to leave Madrid for Paris, which is caused by his dislike of Paul. Feeling that he is behaving too much like a playboy, Maggie admits that she thinks that Pete could be a great newspaper man if he tried. The next morning, Susie attempts to take revenge on Emilio with a devious plan. Fran offers to aid her, but when she crosses paths with Dr. Briones, she dismisses her friend to spend a romantic afternoon with him. Briones criticizes Fran's mockery of her own career, though she rationalizes this by claiming that one should not be serious about a career that is going nowhere. Hereafter, she claims that Briones has left her and that she is planning on returning to the United States. Susie sets out to make Emilio believe that she is falling for him. When he proposes marriage, she hastily accepts and rushes into the proceedings‚Äîwith the intention to scare him off‚Äîmuch to his surprise. Later that night, she confronts him about his playboy behavior, but Emilio claims that he has fallen for her. At the office, Maggie discusses Pete's love for her and Paul expresses his dissatisfaction with current life. It leads to a romantic embrace. Pete walks in on them and storms off. Paul wakes up Maggie that night with a phone call, saying he needs Pete for an assignment. Maggie is upset that Paul assumes that Pete would be with her at night. She throws a tantrum, blaming him for thinking that she is \\"easy.\\" Susie comforts her by informing her about her engagement to Emilio. Then they find out that Fran has left the house. They worry about her, without realizing that she is spending her final days at the beach in Malag√° happily with Briones. Fran offers to cancel her plane to stay with Briones in Malag√°, helping him to save money for his clinic, though he has too much pride to ask her not to leave. Fran returns home to Madrid, telling her friends that Briones was too poor to support her. Susie is stood up by Emilio on an afternoon when she is scheduled to meet his mother (Isobel Elsom). She decides to visit by herself, and is shocked that Mrs. Lacayo has no idea who she is. The older woman apologizes for her son's behavior and explains that this is not the first time that Emilio misled a girl, leaving Susie heartbroken. Back at home, Maggie runs to a formal party with Paul, where she is confronted by Jane for being Paul's mistress. Maggie defends herself by claiming that Jane has lost her husband due to her lack of love for him, and when she furthermore expresses her pity, Jane slaps her and leaves. Maggie gets drunk and allows Pete to take her home. They are about to kiss when she passes out. The following day, Maggie visits the office to inform Paul that she will return to New York with Fran and Susie. Paul accepts the situation and even arranges a meeting with Emilio to make him realize that he has made a mistake with Susie. On their final evening, the three women attend yet another party, where Paul announces his shift to New York. The women decide to stay and are all reunited with their men, though Maggie ends not with Paul, but with Pete, who will be Paul's successor in Madrid.

He is remembered for his assassination in Paris in 1938 by a Polish Jewish teenager, Herschel Grynszpan, which provided a pretext for the Kristallnacht, \\"The Night of Broken Glass\\". Early life and career Vom Rath was born in Frankfurt am Main to an aristocratic family, the son of a high-ranking public official, Gustav vom Rath. He attended a school in Breslau, and then studied law at Bonn, Munich and K√∂nigsberg, until 1932, when he joined the Nazi Party and became a career diplomat. In April 1933 he became a member of the SA, the party's paramilitary unit. In 1935, after a posting in Bucharest, he was posted to the German embassy in Paris. Regarding the \\"Jewish Question\\", Rath expressed regret that the German Jews had to suffer but argued that the anti- Semitic laws were \\"necessary\\" to allow the Volksgemeinschaft to flourish.Schwab, Gerald The Day the Holocaust Began, New York: Praeger, 1990 page 15. Assassination and motives Herschel Grynszpan in Paris just after his arrest (7 November 1938) On the morning of 7 November 1938, Polish-German Jew Herschel Grynszpan, 17, went to the German embassy in Paris and asked to speak with an embassy official. After he had learned of the deportation of his parents from Germany to the Polish frontier, Grynszpan assassinated Ernst vom Rath, the third secretary of the German embassy in Paris. He shot the 29-year- old vom Rath five times, mortally wounding him with bullets to the spleen, stomach and pancreas. Adolf Hitler himself sent his two best doctors, personal physician Karl Brandt and surgeon Georg Magnus, to Paris to try to save vom Rath's life. Hitler promoted vom Rath, who had been a junior officer at the embassy, to the rank of Legal Consul, First Class (Gesandtschaftsrat I. Klasse) hours before vom Rath's death on 9 November at 17:30 (5:30 p.m.). Kristallnacht was launched within hours. Why Grynszpan, who had fled from Germany to France in 1936, chose vom Rath is not known with certainty, although he was upset over the news that his family was being deported from Germany back to Poland. As far as it can be established, Grynszpan and Rath did not know each other. Most accounts of the shooting state that Grynszpan did not ask for vom Rath by name but only asked to speak to a member of the diplomatic staff. The records were falsified in 1942, and the Germans spread propaganda that Grynszpan's intention was to kill the ambassador, Count Johannes von Welczeck. Grynszpan, who was immediately arrested and confessed, insisted his motives were to avenge the Jewish people for the actions already taken by the Germans. He had a postcard on him written to his parents that read, \\"With God's help. My dear parents, I could not do otherwise, may God forgive me, the heart bleeds when I hear of your tragedy and that of the 12,000 Jews. I must protest so that the whole world hears my protest, and that I will do. Forgive me.\\"Schwab 1990, p. 43 Aftermath Vom Rath was given a state funeral on 17 November in D√ºsseldorf, with Hitler and Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop among those in attendance. Germany used the incident to publicize that the Jews had \\"fired the first shot\\" in a war on Germany; in his funeral oration, Ribbentrop declared, \\"We understand the challenge, and we accept it.\\" Ernst vom Rath's grave in D√ºsseldorf American journalist Dorothy Thompson reported widely on the case and raised funds for Grynszpan's defence in his French trial, which never took place. Much to the fury of Grynszpan who wanted to use the defense that he killed Rath because he was a Jew, Grynszpan's French lawyer Vincent de Moro-Giafferi wanted to use as the defense the allegation that Rath was a homosexual who had seduced Grynszpan, and that Grynszpan had killed Rath as a part of a lover's quarrel. Grynszpan initially escaped from prison when France fell in 1940, but he was captured by the Nazis and taken back to Germany. He was sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp to face a trial there, one that Joseph Goebbels planned to turn into Nazi propaganda about an international Jewish conspiracy and to claim it as evidence that Jews had started World War II. However, the allegations emerged that vom Rath was a homosexual, and Goebbels learned that Grynszpan was intending to use this claim in his defence at the trial by implying that vom Rath had seduced him. Grynszpan planned to claim that vom Rath was his pimp and he had been sent to be with various diplomats (although Grynszpan later stated this to be false in an encrypted letter sent from Sachsenhausen). The homosexuality accusations threatened to humiliate the Nazis.Connolly, Kate (30 October 2001). \\"Did gay affair provide a catalyst for Kristallnacht?\\", The Guardian Goebbels wrote that \\"Grynszpan has invented the insolent argument that he had a homosexual relationship with... vom Rath. That is, of course, a shameless lie; however, it is thought out very cleverly and would, if brought out in the course of a public trial, certainly become the main argument of enemy propaganda.\\"Schwab 1990, p. 142 According to historian Hans-J√ºrgen D√∂scher, Germany's foremost authority on Kristallnacht, vom Rath was homosexual and had met Grynszpan in Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a popular haunt for gay men in 1938. The French writer Andr√© Gide, himself a homosexual, testified in his personal diaries that vom Rath was well known in the Parisian homosexual community. There were rumours that occasionally he was called \\"Madame Ambassador\\" and \\"Notre Dame de Paris.\\" His brother, Gustav, was convicted of homosexual offences and there were allegations that vom Rath was treated for rectal gonorrhoea at the Berlin Institute of Radiology.D√∂scher 2006, pp. 165, 182 The trial was planned for 1942 but never took place, primarily because the Nazis (who also sent homosexuals to concentration camps) feared it would turn into a gay scandal. Grynszpan's ultimate fate is unknown but he probably died in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The last documentation indicating he was alive, or thought to be alive, was a Foreign Ministry memorandum on 7 December 1942.Schwab 1990, p. 200 In 1960, at the request of his parents in Israel, the lower district court in Hanover officially declared Grynszpan deceased, listing his date of death as 8 May 1945.

Founded in 1865, the club has a diverse membership from over 70 countries and has reciprocal arrangements with over 130 private members‚Äô clubs around the world. The club is located in the Claymore district off Stevens Road and consists of a main building and a sports centre linked by a pedestrian overhead bridge over Draycott Drive. The club has active member sections for art, balut, billiards, bridge, chess, choir, dance, darts, golf, lawn bowls, scuba, squash, swimming, tennis and ten-pin bowling. History ;The Founding Years The Tanglin Club was founded in 1865 to cater to the social and recreational needs of locally based British officials and expatriates. That year, an interim committee was formed, and it comprised Thomas Dunman (President), Herbert Buchanan (Vice-President), Lancelot C. Masfen, Jos. M. Webster, William Mulholland, Walter Oldham, Edwin A. G. C. Cooke and John R. Forrester. Although race was not stipulated as a criterion for membership, only Europeans were admitted. Club members however, were mainly British. While the exact foundation date of the Tanglin Club is uncertain, it is suspected that the date which had been determined by the Tanglin Club Centenary Celebrations Committee in 1865 was the most convenient day to hold the celebrations. Two letters, which appeared in the Singapore Daily Times on 11 and 13 November 1865, allude to the formation of the club, and that in October 1865, legal documents show without doubt this club to be the Tanglin Club. On 26 June 1866, a property was purchased in the District of Claymore from Arthur Hughes de Wind for 600 dollars. In December 1866, the trustees of the club borrowed 5,000 Spanish dollars to build a clubhouse with bowling alleys, billiards rooms and stables. ;Tanglin It is quite a mystery to why the club was named ‚ÄòTanglin‚Äô, as there is no authority defining the origin or meaning of ‚ÄòTanglin‚Äô. There exists, however, an asok or asoka tree related to the saraca tree which is recorded In Malay, although, the Malays generally refer to this native species as gapis, talan, tengalan or tanglin. Sacred among the Hindus and particularly sacred to the Buddhists as being the tree under which the Buddha was born, this beautiful flowering tree with golden- orange flowers and deep purple pods up to twelve inches long is not common in present-day Singapore. Another derivative for Tanglin may be a corruption of the Chinese words tang ling ‚Äì tang meaning ‚Äòeastern side‚Äô, and ling ‚Äòa small hill‚Äô. In the 1860s, there were plenty of hills in the districts of Tanglin and Claymore ‚Äì Nassim Hill, Mount Elizabeth, Cairnhill, Claymore Hill and Goodwood Hill. While it may never be known how the name ‚ÄòTanglin‚Äô originated, but as there are many places in Malaysia named after trees, it is possible that the club was named after the tree of the same name ‚Äì perhaps one was growing on the very spot where the clubhouse stood. ;A Tumultuous Start About two years after its founding, the club's management committee was unable to repay the first instalment of 2,000 Spanish dollars, which was due on 30 November 1868. The costs of construction of the clubhouse and the provision of amenities combined with the expenses involved in running the club must have placed a tremendous burden on its financial resources. The financial strain was made worse when the second instalment of the principal mortgage sum was due on 30 November 1871; the club was again unable to pay both that and the sum of 2,000 dollars. Ten years after the loan of 5,000 dollars was drawn, the club could not afford to repay any of the principal sum borrowed. Even the staff's wages were left unpaid. An extraordinary general meeting of the club was then called on 20 June 1876 to resolve the club's indebtedness. The meeting passed four resolutions, including appointing a committee to enquire and report to an adjournment of this meeting whether any person will advance 5,000 dollars on a mortgage of the club, and that a Member be appointed to purchase the property and re-mortgage the whole property to the new mortgage. No records of subsequent meetings are available but it is evident that the Tanglin Club literally went under the hammer. Nevertheless, the club continued to function notwithstanding the charge and conveyance of its property, but likely only so because of the somewhat complex financial arrangement that had been devised to permit the continued use of the club and its facilities by its members. The saga of the original loan of 5,000 dollars continued until nearly the turn of the last century when the club's membership numbered around two hundred. In 1899, the club's indebtedness arising from this loan was finally totally discharged. ;World Wars of the 20th Century Tanglin Club in Singapore - circa 1910 By the 1890s, the Claymore district had evolved into a prestigious district occupied by many prominent European residents. During the construction of the German Teutonia Club (present-day Goodwood Park Hotel), the Tanglin Club accommodated the Teutonia members. When the palatial Teutonia Club was completed in 1900, it quickly overshadowed the old and dismal looking the Tanglin Club. The Tanglin Club's German membership had dwindled from a strong number of 236 a decade ago to 181 in 1911. When World War I broke out in 1914, Teutonia Club was declared an enemy property. Several years after the end of the First World War in the early 1920s, the Tanglin Club purchased additional blocks of land. However, the good fortune of the Club was short- lived towards the end of the 1920s. The Great Depression had begun, and the finances of the club were severely strained. During the Japanese occupation, the Tanglin Club was used by the Japanese army as a club for their officers. The club was also used as a base for their propaganda unit as well as their storage area for rations and weapons. After the Japanese surrender, the Tanglin Club came under the management of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI) until March 1946. It was not until 1 September 1946 that the club was informally reopened. ;The Post-War Period The men who gathered in the dining room of the Singapore Club on 21 May 1946 faced a daunting task ‚Äì to reinstate the Tanglin Club, an institution founded seventy-five years earlier as a premier establishment ‚Äì like the ‚Äòforty good men and true‚Äô who had met in 1865. The dedication of the post-war committee paid off; despite the difficulties faced, the club reopened informally on 1 September 1946, with 182 Ordinary Members, including 127 pre-war registered members, 23 lady members and provision for up to 300 service members. During the 1950s, the club consolidated its finances and continued to build up its membership. By September 1950, the membership stood at 1,309 ‚Äì including 13 life and honorary members ‚Äì and the waiting list was temporarily closed for the first time after the war. The last significant event in the years leading to the centenary of the Tanglin Club in 1965 concerned the opening of membership. Although the rules of the club did not specifically deny membership on the grounds of race, but in practice, the club was British. In 1959, the elected government decided to eliminate the advantage enjoyed by citizens of the United Kingdom and British colonies in their eligibility for Singapore citizenship. An amended citizenship bill passed in May 1960 disallowed dual nationality and made the period of residence to qualify for Singapore citizenship eight years for all applicants, including British subjects. ;Change in Membership Rules In 1962, the government appealed to clubs in Singapore to have at least 50% Singaporean membership. After an extraordinary general meeting, the club's membership rule was amended to admit all races. The first Singaporeans to join the club included Shaw Vee Meng, Dr Yeo Chee Peng, Tan Eng Han, Koh Eng Yam, U. S. Chan and C. K. Sng. In 1971, the completion of the pull out of the British forces stationed in Singapore signalled the end of a tradition in membership and association extended by the Tanglin Club from its founding. At a special meeting of Members on 3 May 1973, the category of Service membership was deleted from the club rules. By October 1978, the membership stood at 2,561 with 498 on the waiting list. Traditionally, women paid lower membership fees but were not given voting rights. It was only in April 1995 that women who were full members were accorded equal voting privileges in the club. Due to the club's constitution that capped Singaporean membership to 51%, the waiting time for Singaporeans has been known to be as long as 25 years. ;New Clubhouse The construction of a new four-storey clubhouse was carried out in phases since September 1977 and was completed in March 1981. On 14 March 1981, members bade farewell to the original clubhouse at a closing ceremony. Before the old clubhouse was demolished, memorabilia from the old building were auctioned off in support of the Children's Charity Association of Singapore. More than a month later, on 25 April 1998, the present clubhouse was officially opened by the then Minister for Law Edmund W. Barker. Over the years, the clubhouse had been upgraded to cater to members' needs. In 2005, the club embarked on a $21 million upgrading plan that included the construction of a new sports complex. ;Interment of the Time Capsule During the 125th Anniversary celebrations of 1990, the then general committee carried out the interment of a time capsule. Containing various items of historical interest for future historians, the time capsule has rested undisturbed and shall not be opened till the 200th anniversary of the club in October 2065. ;150th Anniversary To commemorate the Big 150, events and promotions in celebration of this momentous milestone were featured throughout the year. On 9 October 2015, Children's Day, the club hosted a poolside carnival for approximately 150 disadvantaged children. To make this event more special, Members kindly volunteered to lend a helping hand during the carnival. On the same day, the club held a specially commissioned 150th celebratory musical, ‚ÄòThe Tanglin Tree‚Äô, composed by John Sharpley, with lyrics by Tanglin Club member Robert Yeo. Over forty artists joined hands to create this unique Tanglin production. In honour of the club's official colour, a Club-wide celebration ‚ÄòHallow‚Äôgreen‚Äô on 31 October 2015 was thrown. To commemorate the 150th anniversary, the then general committee members gathered for the planting of a Tanglin tree at the poolside area on 14 December 2015. The biggest milestone of the 150th Anniversary was the Charity Drive which raised a total of nearly $450,000, from members who generously contributed to this initiative. During the club's Charity Black Tie Gala Dinner in November 2015, a cheque of $195,975 was presented to Singapore President Tony Tan for the President's Challenge. By December 2015, the final donation to the President's Challenge amounted to $220,625. $73,550 was donated to Food from the Heart; $73,550 was donated to the Kidney Dialysis Foundation; a donation of $73,525 was channelled to Focus on the Family Singapore. Aside from the Charity Drive, $5,762 was donated to the club's adopted charity for 2015, Dover Park Hospice. ;The Tanglin Club Today Currently, the Tanglin Club stands proud as one of Singapore's oldest and prominent social clubs. Exclusively available to its members, the club is an inviting oasis for relaxation and rejuvenation as its ambience still evokes the grace and charm of the past while reflecting its mission of being a \\"home away from home\\". Even more so today, the Tanglin Club with its strategic location, cosmopolitan membership and modern facilities, caters to the wants and desires of contemporary men and women.

It is the southern terminus of the Ashmont branch of the rapid transit Red Line, the northern terminus of the connecting light rail Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High-Speed Line, and a major terminal for MBTA bus service. Ashmont has two side platforms serving the below-grade Red Line and a single side platform on an elevated balloon loop for the Mattapan Line. The station is fully accessible for all modes. History Streetcar loading platforms at the Ashmont station in 1929 The first Ashmont station was a simple building along the original Shawmut Branch of the Old Colony Railroad, which opened in 1872. Service on the branch ended in 1926 as the Boston Elevated Railway constructed its Dorchester Extension. Ashmont and stations opened on September 1, 1928, with Ashmont the terminal station. Like , Ashmont was designed for convenient transfer between rapid transit trains and surface streetcars. It had two island platforms with rapid transit on the inner tracks and streetcars on the outer tracks, allowing cross-platform transfers in both directions. Several streetcar lines were replaced with buses shortly after the station opened, using a surface-level busway on the west side of the station. In 1929, the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway began operating bus service to Ashmont; unlike Fields Corner and , it was never served by Eastern Mass streetcars. The Eastern Mass eventually operated three bus routes out of Ashmont, all of which became MBTA bus routes in 1971: to Brockton (now route ), to Quincy via Granite Avenue (), and to Quincy via Adams Street (). The remaining surface streetcar lines running to Ashmont were gradually replaced by buses, with the final two routes (now routes and ) replaced by trolleybuses in 1949. The grade-separated Mattapan Line continued streetcar operation. From 1948 to 1968, Hudson Bus Lines operated service from Ashmont to several South Shore locations. The station was modernized in 1976. The station was made nominally accessible, though the 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act created stricter standards. In 1981, the platforms were extended for six-car trains, which were introduced in 1988. =Reconstruction= An Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan line streetcar on the new loop at Ashmont in 2016 The MBTA issued a $4.3 million design contract for renovations of Ashmont, Shawmut, and Fields Corner stations on May 3, 2001; the Ashmont portion was $1.3 million. The agency issued a request for proposals for transit-oriented development on an adjacent MBTA-owned parcel on January 22, 2002, and began negotiations with a developer that June. The developer signed an 85-year lease and paid $1.4 million up front to the MBTA. The Ashmont station renovation was originally to be smaller in scope than the major projects planned at the other Ashmont branch stations. The developer and the local community expressed their desires for a larger renovation, but the MBTA proceeded with design work. On January 10, 2003, with design work at 90% and $2.2 million spent, the MBTA stopped work. A $3.3 million design for a full reconstruction was authorized on February 12, 2004. The Shawmut and Fields Corner projects were constructed separate from the delayed Ashmont work. The MBTA removed the membrane canopy from the design in September 2004 due to lack of funds. However, it was necessary to re-add (at a cost of $2.9 million) because many of the interior elements were not weatherproofed. In September 2004, the MBTA began reconstruction of the 75-year-old station, then expected to cost $44 million. The MBTA awarded the $35.2 million main construction contract on June 9 2005. The reconstruction included demolition of the existing station, the addition of two fare lobbies over the ends of the station, and a new busway at the fare lobby level. Elevators were added to make station fully accessible, and direct access from Peabody Square (removed in the 1970s renovation) was added. The Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan line loop was moved to a new viaduct at the south end of the station, with a platform near the south fare lobby; the former cross-platform transfer was eliminated. Red Line service to Ashmont was maintained through the whole construction process. However, the Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan line was closed from June 24, 2006 to December 22, 2007 for construction of the new viaduct. During that time, Mattapan station and the intermediate stations were also renovated for accessibility. The main reconstruction contract was completed in 2009 at a cost of $53.2 million - an increase of $18 million over the original price due to change orders. The $10.3 million architectural work lasted until June 14, 2011, at which point the station was declared accessible. In September 2011, a \\"HOLD\\" sign was installed on the trolley platform to allow an easier connection for those transferring from the Red Line. The total cost of the entire reconstruction was $83 million.

He was encouraged in musical pursuits, playing cello in the family string quartet. However he did not pursue music as a career until late in his life.  Biography  Rimsky- Korsakov studied philosophy at university and went on to teach the subject in gymnasiums until 1912, when he took the position of music correspondent for the Russian paper Russkaya molva. (Despite being a friend of Igor Stravinsky, among Rimsky-Korsakov's writings for that publication is included a scathing review of The Rite of Spring.) He then went on to become founding editor of the first Russian music magazine, Muz√Økal'n√Øy sovremennik (1915‚Äì17), which covered musicological study as well as concerts. After the demise of Muz√Økal'n√Øy sovremennik, Rimsky-Korsakov headed the music department of the Leningrad Salt√Økov-Shchedrin Public Library (though he contributed to three issues of the magazine's successor, which began publication in 1922) and taught music theory and music history at Leningrad University as well as the Institute of Historical Studies. Many of Rimsky-Korsakov's more notable efforts were on behalf of his father's work, including the authorship of a five-volume study of his life and work and the establishing of a museum for the late composer. He was married to the composer Yuliya Veysberg.

Duties and functions While specific duties vary between establishments, hall monitors typically check hall passes; maintain overall good conduct in the corridors; and ensure that students are punctual in attending classes. Hall monitors may also be posted to a school's doors in order to prevent unauthorized entry during recess, in which case they may be known as door monitors. At some schools, a hall monitor may receive extra privileges and authority not afforded to other students. In other countries In Malta a few schools have monitors, mostly door, class and hall monitors. Their job is not to let anyone into classes before the lessons start and during recess. Class monitors are like prefects but only stay with the class until the teacher arrives for the first lesson in the morning or right after recess. In Ontario, Canada, Hall Monitors (if present at all) are not student volunteers, but actual paid security guards who patrol corridors and maintain security within a secondary school. There may be 1-4 hall monitors depending on the size of the secondary school. In India the title is only monitor who has responsibilities for assisting teachers in class. In South Korea, monitors do not walk around the hall. In the morning, they are all around the school, looking for students who aren't wearing the proper uniform or shoes, or who are late for school. They catch them and write their names so they will get points for doing wrong things. If they get too many points they have to work for the school. If they get even more points after that, or an extremely high number of points, then they have to transfer to another school.

He is an ordained Conservative rabbi and has also trained with Catholic moral theologians. Since 1997 he has taught religion and philosophy at the University of Toronto; his areas of interest are Jewish theology, ethics and biomedical ethics, political theory (with a special emphasis on natural law theory) and Jewish-Christian relations. Novak has authored 16 books and more than 200 articles in scholarly journals. His book Covenantal Rights: A Study in Jewish Political Theory (Princeton University Press, 2000) was named best book in constructive religious thought by the American Academy of Religion in 2000. He is a regular contributor to ABC News' Religion and Ethics Portal. He frequently addresses interfaith conferences and contributes to books and journals published by Christian theologians. Early life and education Novak was born in 1941 in Chicago, Illinois. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1961 and his master's degree in Hebrew literature in 1964. He earned his Ph.D. in philosophy at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., in 1971. (Later he remarked that he chose Georgetown in part because it was a Catholic university.) He received rabbinical ordination in 1966 from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he studied under Abraham Joshua Heschel. He married Melva Ziman in 1963. They have two children and five grandchildren. Rabbinic career Novak was a pulpit rabbi in several US communities from 1966 to 1989. He also served as a Jewish chaplain at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, National Institute of Mental Health, Washington, D.C., from 1966 to 1969. Academic career In 1989 he moved to the University of Virginia as Edgar M. Bronfman Professor of Modern Judaic Studies, a position he held until 1997. Since 1997 he has held the J. Richard and Dorothy Shiff Chair of Jewish Studies as Professor of the Study of Religion and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto. He is also a member of the Joint Centre for Bioethics. From 1997 to 2002 he also directed the Jewish Studies Programme. In 1992‚Äì93 he was a Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Washington, D.C. He also lectured at Oxford University, Lancaster University and Drew University, and was a visiting scholar at Princeton University in 2004 and 2006. Contributions =Ethics= Novak has contributed to Jewish ethics by advocating a Jewish social ethics drawn from both the natural law tradition and Halakha. To this end, he interprets the rabbinic approach to Noahide laws as a useful grounding for cross-cultural moral reasoning. His expertise includes Maimonides, John Courtney Murray, and Paul Tillich. In his theology, he combines Jewish rabbinical tradition and logic with Christian teachings. His specific normative claims in Jewish ethics include a mix of liberal and right-wing positions. An ordained rabbi, Novak had been affiliated with the Conservative movement in Judaism and then shifted to the Union for Traditional Judaism. =Interfaith= Novak, together with Peter Ochs, Tikva Frymer-Kensky, and Michael Signer, drafted a full-page advertisement which appeared in the Sunday, 10 September 2000 edition of The New York Times under the title \\"Dabru Emet (Speak Truth): A Jewish statement on Christians and Christianity\\". Among the eight theological statements which the advertisement briefly laid out were: \\"Nazism is not a Christian phenomenon\\"; \\"Humanly irreconcilable differences between Jews and Christians will not be settled until God redeems the entire world as promised in Scripture\\"; and the statement which generated the most controversy in Jewish circles, \\"Jews and Christians worship the same God\\". The advertisement was signed by 160 rabbis, including many leading Reform, Reconstructionist and Conservative thinkers and a handful of Orthodox rabbis known for their interfaith work. Explaining his rationale for publishing the document, Novak told Jweekly: \\"I want Jewish readers to clearly realize that Christians are not necessarily our enemies. Quite the contrary, they can be very good friends to Jews and Judaism\\". The document was subsequently translated into eight languages. While some modern Jews are offended by the traditional Christian belief in supersessionism,Rabbi Dow Marmur, Lecture at Regis College, Toronto, January 21, 1998, see at June 28, 2008 Rabbi and Jewish theologian David Novak has stated that \\"Christian supersessionism need not denigrate Judaism. Christian supersessionism can still affirm that God has not annulled his everlasting covenant with the Jewish people, neither past nor present nor future.\\" Novak suggests that there are three options:David Novak, 'The Covenant in Rabbinic Thought', in Eugene B. Korn (ed.), Two Faiths, One Covenant?: Jewish and Christian Identity in the Presence of the Other, (Rowman & Littlefield, 2004), pp. 65‚Äì80. # The new covenant is an extension of the old covenant. # The new covenant is an addition to the old covenant. # The new covenant is a replacement for the old covenant. He observes, \\"In the early Church, it seems, the new covenant presented by the Apostolic Writings (better known as diatheke ekaine or novum testamentum) was either taken to be an addition to the old covenant (the religion of the Torah and Jewish Pharisaic tradition), or it was taken to be a replacement for the old covenant.\\"David Novak, 'The Covenant in Rabbinic Thought', in Eugene B. Korn (ed.), Two Faiths, One Covenant?: Jewish and Christian Identity in the Presence of the Other, (Rowman & Littlefield, 2004), pp. 66. Novak considers both understandings to be supersessionist. He designates the first as \\"soft supersessionism\\" and the second as \\"hard supersessionism.\\" The former \\"does not assert that God terminated the covenant of Exodus-Sinai with the Jewish people. Rather, it asserts that Jesus came to fulfill the promise of the old covenant, first for those Jews already initiated into the covenant, who then accepted his messiahhood as that covenant's fulfillment. And, it asserts that Jesus came to both initiate and fulfill the promise of the covenant for those Gentiles whose sole connection to the covenant is through him. Hence, in this kind of supersessionism, those Jews who do not accept Jesus' messiahhood are still part of the covenant in the sense of 'what God has put together let no man put asunder' [emphasis original].\\" See also Dual-covenant theology. Hard supersessionism, on the other hand, asserts that \\"[t]he old covenant is dead. The Jews by their sins, most prominently their sin of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah, have forfeited any covenantal status.\\" The hard supersessionists base their views on the bible passages found in and . This classification provides mutually exclusive options. Hard supersessionism implies both punitive and economic supersessionism; soft supersessionism does not fall into any of the three classes recognized as supersessionist by Christian theologians; instead it is associated with Jewish Christianity.Novak. \\"The Covenant in Rabbinic Thought.\\" \\"Two Faiths, One Covenant?: Jewish and Christian Identity in the Presence of ....\\" Ed.

On January 6, 1960, the Douglas DC-6 serving the flight exploded in midair. The National Airlines aircraft was carrying 5 crew members and 29 passengers, all of whom perished. The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation concluded that the plane was brought down by a bomb made of dynamite. No criminal charges were ever filed, nor was the blame for the bombing ever determined, though a suicide bombing is suspected. The investigation remains open today. One of the victims was retired U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Edward Orrick McDonnell, a Medal of Honor recipient and veteran of both World Wars.  Flight history  National Airlines' New York-Miami route was usually flown by a Boeing 707 as Flight 601. On January 5, 1960, the 707 aircraft scheduled to fly to Miami was grounded due to cracks that were discovered in the cockpit windshield. The windshield replacement procedure would take eight hours to perform, so National Airlines transferred the passengers of Flight 601 to two propliner aircraft it had in reserve. Passengers were boarded on these two replacement planes on a first-come, first-served basis. 76 passengers boarded a Lockheed L-188 Electra. This aircraft flew to Miami and arrived safely. The remaining 29 passengers boarded a Douglas DC-6B, which departed Idlewild Airport for Miami as Flight 2511. They were accompanied by two stewardesses, pilot Dale Southard, copilot Richard L. Hentzel, and flight engineer Robert R. Halleckson. The plane departed New York at 11:52 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive in Miami at 4:36 a.m. on January 6. The aircraft, registration was described as being in good condition. It had four Pratt and Whitney R-2800 CB-16 engines and had accumulated 24,836 hours of flight time. 2511's flight plan called for it to fly south from New York to Wilmington, North Carolina, where it would continue south over the Atlantic Ocean. It would fly south over the ocean to Palm Beach, Florida. The crew maintained radio contact with National Airlines' radio controllers and air traffic control, reporting clouds and instrument flying conditions. The crew checked in with Wilmington Airport at 2:07 a.m., and later reported flying over the Carolina Beach radio beacon at 2:31 a.m. This was the last radio contact with the airplane.  Aftermath  After losing contact with the DC-6 aircraft, National Airlines, the United States Coast Guard, and the United States Navy began an intensive search along the southeastern coast of the United States. The search was called off the following day, when National Airlines received word that there was a plane down in North Carolina. At about 2:45 a.m. a farmer, Richard Randolph, heard the sound of an engine cutting in and out, followed by tearing metal and an explosion. Later that morning, after his teenage son McArthur Randolph found airplane wreckage in one of father's fields, Richard Randolph drove to Bolivia, North Carolina, which had the nearest phone. He called Wilmington Airport to report the downed plane at approximately 7:00 a.m. When Highway Patrol officers responded, he led them to the crash site. Bodies and wreckage were scattered over an area of covering farm fields, marshland, and pine forests. During the first day of search and rescue, investigators were able to locate 32 bodies of the 34 persons on board. One of the missing bodies was later found at the main crash site. The remaining body was found at Snow's Marsh, approximately from the main site. Initial reports speculated that the aircraft had disintegrated in mid-flight. One newspaper reporter indicated that the largest piece of wreckage he observed was a portion of the wing. A fragment of aluminum, believed to be a piece of the airplane's skin, was found on Kure Beach, from the rest of the wreckage.  Investigations  Approximate flight path of Flight 2511, with the crash site, Kure Beach, and Snow's Marsh marked. Source: Civil Aeronautics Board report. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), part of the Department of Transportation, were the primary investigators into the crash of Flight 2511. The wreckage of the DC-6 was taken to a hangar at nearby Wilmington Airport, where the fuselage was reassembled on a wood-and-chicken-wire frame. Investigators recovered approximately 90% of the fuselage, which was then assembled on the frame in the Wilmington hangar. Investigators were able to identify the point of origin of the disintegration as an area immediately ahead of the leading edge of the aircraft's right wing. The material recovered from Kure Beach, including a portion of the wing fillet, was from this general area. Investigators were unable to recover material from an irregular, triangularly shaped area positioned above the leading edge and extending forward ahead of the wing. The bodies were taken to the local high school gymnasium to await autopsy and identification by a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprinting team. The Brunswick County coroner ordered autopsies of the passengers and crew to determine the specific cause of death for each. One of the victims was Vice Admiral Edward Orrick McDonnell, U.S. Navy (retired), a recipient of the Medal of Honor and a veteran of both World Wars. Other victims included a vice president of the Continental Bank of Cuba, a pharmacist, a student at the University of Miami, and an insurance adjuster. Three of the victims had been standby passengers and only made the flight due to others cancelling their reservations. = Julian Frank = The only body not found at the main crash site was that of Julian Frank, a New York City lawyer. His body was recovered from Snow's Marsh, located on the west side of the Cape Fear River. Frank's body had sustained significant injuries, including the amputation of both legs, and debris was embedded in his body. Frank's injuries were significantly different from and much more extensive than the other passengers'. Furthermore, Frank's injuries were inconsistent with the type of injury usually incurred in an aircraft accident. Frank was autopsied twice, the second time to recover debris embedded in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; the fingers of his right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site. At the time of the crash, Frank had been accused of running a charity scam and was under investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office. It was alleged that he had misappropriated up to a million dollars in a series of scams. = Bombing = The crash of National Airlines Flight 2511 came shortly after the crash of another National Airlines plane. National Airlines Flight 967 exploded over the Gulf of Mexico on November 16, 1959. The cause of the explosion was believed to be a bomb in the luggage of one of the passengers, Dr. Robert Spears, who enlisted a substitute to board the plane in his place. Spears was heavily insured, and the FBI indicated that his motive was insurance fraud. Similarly, Julian Frank was covered by almost $900,000 in life insurance policies, including some purchased the day of the crash. The CAB sent the material recovered from Frank's body to the FBI laboratories for testing and analysis. Analysis determined that the many wire fragments that were found embedded in Frank's body, in the seats on the right-hand side, and in the carpeting, were low-carbon steel wire, in diameter. One of the dismembered fingers recovered from the wreckage had embedded in it the face plate of a travel alarm clock. A life jacket from Kure Beach, found with parts of a flight bag embedded in it, tested positive for nitrate residue. A black \\"crusty\\" residue on Frank's right hand was found to be manganese dioxide, a substance found in dry cell batteries. In addition to the evidence collected from Frank's body, there were also samples of residue taken from the air vents and hat rack located on the right side of the aircraft near the leading edge of the wing. These samples contained sodium carbonate, sodium nitrate, and mixtures of sodium-sulfur compounds. The Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion. Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected in the area around the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body indicated that a dry cell battery was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the window seat of row 7. The CAB's chief investigator, Oscar Bakke, testified before the Senate Aviation subcommittee to this effect on January 12, 1960. The same day, the FBI formally took over the criminal aspects of the investigation. = Other theories = One of the first theories considered by investigators was that Flight 2511 was involved in a collision with another airliner, given the crash site's proximity to Wilmington Airport. Investigators reviewed the flight plan and other documents to determine if other aircraft were in the area. There was no record of any other aircraft, or of any military missiles having been fired. Furthermore, wreckage of Flight 2511 was confined to two general locations, namely the primary crash scene near Bolivia and the secondary scene in Kure Beach. All debris was accounted for as belonging to the DC-6. Another theory presented by an expert shortly after the crash theorized that an engine fire could have been the catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as the fact that some of the passengers were found wearing life jackets. Though the bombing and engine fire theories were the most commonly held, other theories were advanced during the investigation as well. Several days after the explosion, National Airlines pilots who were members of the Airline Pilots Association sent a telegram to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In the telegram, they made the claim that the routine proficiency flights performed by pilots caused unnecessary stress on the aircraft. These test flights, which pilots underwent every six months, required the pilots to put their aircraft through \\"violent maneuvers\\" which could damage the aircraft. In their final report, the Civil Aeronautics Board indicated that it had investigated a variety of alternative theories, including: * metal fatigue failure of the cabin leading to explosive decompression * a propeller blade failing, striking, and rupturing the cabin * a malfunction in the cabin pressurization system leading to structural failure * a foreign object striking the plane and penetrating the cabin * lightning strike * fuel vapor explosion * oxygen bottle explosion The CAB was, however, able to rule out each of these theories during the course of their investigation. = Conclusions = The Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that Flight 2511 was brought down by a dynamite explosion in the passenger cabin. The explosive charge was located \\"beneath the extreme right seat of seat row No. 7.\\" The report also pointed out that Julian Frank was close to the explosion, though it assigned no blame to him. The explosion occurred at approximately 2:33 a.m., significantly damaging the structural integrity of the aircraft and forcing it into a wide, right-hand turn. As it descended, it suffered an in-flight disintegration and crashed at 2:38 a.m. The CAB concluded in their final report: > No reference is made in this report concerning the placing of the dynamite > aboard the aircraft or of the person or persons responsible for its > detonation. The malicious destruction of an aircraft is a Federal crime. > After the Board's determination that such was involved, the criminal aspects > of this accident were referred to the Department of Justice through its > Federal Bureau of Investigation ... > > The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the > detonation of dynamite within the passenger cabin. ‚Äî Civil Aeronautics Board > File No. 1-0002, pp. 1,12 The FBI assumed control of the criminal investigation on January 20, 1960.

There are 49 children's aid societies across Ontario, including 11 Indigenous societies.http://www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/professionals/childwelfare/societies/index.aspx An oversight body known as The Child and Family Services Review Board exists to investigate complaints against a CAS and maintains authority to issue orders against the Societies. Authority Children's Aid Societies have authority under provincial legislationhttp://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c11_e.htm#BK59 to remove children from homes where they face either a risk of harm, or have experienced harm. Children who cannot remain with caregivers are sometimes placed with other family members (\\"kin\\"), family friends (\\"kith\\"), or in customary care, which is an option for aboriginal children. In other cases, children can be placed into foster homes or group homes, as well as being adopted. Statistics Over the 12-month period from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008, Ontario's Children's Aid Societies provided child welfare services to communities across Ontario. There were 77,089 allegations of child abuse and neglect investigated in Ontario. 27,816 Children were in the care of Children's Aid Society for protection from abuse and neglect. Of the children who were cared for by a society during the year, 9,468 came into care upon completion of abuse investigations. Of these, 6,565 children had not previously been in care and 2,903 children were returned to care due to new child protection concerns. Less than 1% of Ontario's 3 million children were in the care of Children's Aid Societies in the year 2007. Conversely, during the 12 months between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, The Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario reviewed 91 cases including 18 Medical and 73 CAS cases that had received service during that time or up to 12 months previously. The causes of death were determined to be: ‚Ä¢ Medical: Natural, 17; Accident, 0; Homicide, 0; Suicide, 1; Undetermined, 0. ‚Ä¢ CAS: Natural, 10; Accident, 23; Homicide, 10; Suicide, 8; Undetermined, 15; Still under investigation, 7. On their website, a Children's Aid Society makes the claim that most of the children who they visit remain in their homes; The number of children coming into care each year has continued to decline, in line with the general downward trend in Ontario's child population. In 2007/08 9,468 children came into care, a 26% decline compared to 2003/04. The rate of admissions into care was 3 children per 1000 of Ontario's children population. Ontario's leading academic study on child abuse and neglect states that exposure to intimate partner violence represents the largest proportion of substantiated maltreatment investigations. Almost half (48 percent) of all substantiated investigations identified exposure to intimate partner violence as the primary form of maltreatment (an estimated 20,443 investigations or 8.70 investigations per 1,000 children).http://cwrp.ca/sites/default/files/publications/en/ois-2013_final.pdf Children's Aid Societies also provide assessments, crisis intervention, counseling and services to prevent child abuse and neglect. In addition, Children's Aid Societies help vulnerable families protect and support their children. Many prevention programs are offered in partnership with other community agencies. Child protection workers also work to support families in crisis where their children are not in need of protection. A child protection worker remains involved with the family to ensure the appropriate supports and community services are in place. In 2007/08, 24,955 families received ongoing support from Children's Aid Societies where a child was in need of protection. Advocacy group membership Ontario Association of Children's Aid Societies (OACAS) is a membership organization representing CASs in Ontario, Canada. Influencing government decisions, funding, and public opinion by promoting child welfare issues is a critical goal. Failures to provide for the needs of children Every year the Office of the Coroner publishes a report on all children who died aged 5 and under all children who died while being served by a Children's Aid Society including children who were served up to 12 months prior to their deaths. These reviews are completed by the Pediatric Death Review Committee (PDRC) 2009 Deaths Occurring and Reported by a Children's Aid Society: Total Cases 120 Executive Review Only in 2009 74 Pending DU5C 2010/2011 10 Internal & PDRC Review 2010/2011 36 *Note: these categories are explained below in more detail. As per the Joint Directive for the reporting and reviewing of all child deaths known to a children's aid society within 12 months of the death, 120 child deaths were reported to the PDRC in 2009. In each case the CAS that provided service to the family submitted a serious occurrence report and within 14 days of the death submitted a Child Fatality Case Summary Report to the PDRC. The Executive Committee of the PDRC screens these reports and, within 7 days, a decision is made whether the CAS will be required to complete an Internal Review for the purposes of a future PDRC review. The decision to request an Internal Review is based on the criteria set out in the Joint Directive. The Executive Committee of the PDRC reviewed all 120 deaths and requested Society Internal Reviews be submitted in 36 of them. A decision on 10 other cases is pending the anticipated review by the Deaths Under 5 Committee where cause and manner of death will be determined. It was determined that 74 of the 120 cases would not necessitate further review given the nature of the child's death and/or the Society's involvement. The majority of these cases were medically fragile infants or children who died as a result of natural causes, most of whom were in hospital born prematurely or with complex medical and/or genetic conditions. Most deaths are not reviewed in the year of death due to these timelines, the volume of cases, and the length of time required to complete a coroner's investigation, including various tests and reports. Additionally, cases before the criminal courts are generally not reviewed until any outstanding charges are resolved. Explanations: Executive Review Only: Are cases which, when reviewed by the Executive Committee of the PDRC (Chair and Coordinators), it is determined that no further review by the CAS or PDRC is required, as the death could not reasonably have been prevented or predicted by a CAS or medical intervention. For example, cases where the child's family had no CAS involvement until shortly before the death, or the child was known to CAS, but the death was natural and not unexpected, or the child died as the result of an incident unrelated to the family's involvement with CAS (i.e. child died in a car accident and the case was open to assist the parents in managing the behaviour of a different child). Pending DU5C: On occasion, the decision to request an Internal Child Death Review is postponed pending the results of the coroner's investigation and/or review by the Deaths Under 5 Committee. Internal & PDRC Review: If the PDRC requests an Internal Child Death Review, agencies are given 90 days in which to submit their report, and the PDRC has up to 12 months to review the case and issue a report that may contain further recommendations. Expectations for such reviews are explained on this page. CAS Status of Children Who Died in 2009 ‚Ä¢ 19 (16%) of the 120 reported child deaths in 2009 were in the care of a CAS; eight of those were crown wards. Additionally, two youths were living on Extended Care and Maintenance (ECM). ‚Ä¢ 101 (84%) of the deaths involved children living with families who had received CAS services in the previous 12 months. ‚Ä¢ 43 of the 120 deaths of children were considered to be medically fragile meaning their deaths were not sudden or unexpected; this included 12 of the 19 children in care. In its Child Welfare Report, 2009‚Äì10, the Ontario Association of Children's Aid Societies reports the following: ‚Ä¢ Ontario CASs provided substitute care to more than 27,000 children in 2008-09 ‚Ä¢There were 17,876 children in care of a CAS on March 31, 2009 ‚Ä¢ 9,200 of those children and youth in care are permanent wards ‚Ä¢ Over 28% of the 2,112 Aboriginal children in care of four of six designated agencies are in customary care arrangements. ‚Ä¢ Ontario has the second lowest rate of children in care in Canada at 6.4 per 1,000 ‚Ä¢The most common reasons children and youth are admitted to care are: 1. neglect 2. emotional harm 3. physical harm 4. sexual harm 5. domestic violence 6. problematic behaviour of the child ‚Ä¢ Children in care account for approximately 1 in 10 cases serviced by a CAS ‚Ä¢ In 90% of families receiving services from a CAS, children remain at home Children's Aid Societies have been found guilty of incompetence, negligence and malicious prosecution. In 2010 a Psychologist employed by Durham CAS was found guilty for misrepresenting his qualifications. Hundreds of children under supervision of CAS have died in the last few years but CAS will not release much information citing privacy concerns. In the province of Ontario, the majority of front- line CAS workers are not registered social workers. Several groups, including Canadacourtwatch.org posting Case Law and Canada Court Watch.com's public protest efforts have brought these issues to light, citing concerns with respect to accountability. Controversy Powerful As God, a 2011 film focusing on the first hand experiences of 26 individuals who witnessed the social devastation caused by Ontario CAS in recent years. This documentary reveals a hidden world of corruption, power hunger and incompetence that has been hidden from the scrutiny of the public eye for many decades. This award- winning film was produced and published by the Documentary Media (MFA) Program, Ryerson University and can be viewed online. In March 2013, The Toronto Star published an article about a leaked memo which would suggest that the CAS are funded on open cases and on a per-child basis. In this memo, Peel workers were urged to delay the closing of files for as long as possible sparking controversy with parents with open files and children in care. Families who are separated by court orders who should return were met with high resistance by the CAS. This is also the potential proof that the funding model that CAS is currently receiving is being corrupted to achieve maximum funding by the government.https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/03/15/childrens_aid_society_funding_model_with_perverse_incentives_set_to_change_this_year.html  References  External links * Child and Family Services Act * Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms * StopCas.ca - Advocacy to disband the CAS and replace with an Ontario Government Dept. of Child Protection. * Life In Foster Care Is Like A Subway Ride (A CBC Radio documentary which takes you on a 13-minute virtual subway ride through foster care by a Canadian foster care survivor John Dunn of http://www.johnsinformation.com) * CanadaCourtWatch.ORG - Enhanced Watchdog for Ontario CAS abuse with Canadian Case Law searches published. * Canada Court Watch.com - Court watchdog focusing on CAS related issues. * Ryerson University documentary film of CAS abuses, 'Powerful as God'. * Misleading Government CAS resources, brochures in: BAD Self-Help Law Books - PDF Category:Adoption-related organizations Category:Children's charities based in Canada Category:Social work organizations in Canada ","title":"Children's Aid Society (Ontario)"},{"id":"1923365","text":"Unsifted wheat flour Aleuromancy is the use of flour for divination.

Flour was poured out in small heaps and the interpretation was based on the observation of their shapes and orientation. In its original form, slips of paper containing philosophical writings would be baked inside of cakes or cookies, which would then be distributed to those wishing their fortunes to be told. Similarly, the Greeks would bake slips of paper with sentences on them inside of balls of flour, mix the balls nine times, and distribute them.

In 1910, when the Empire of Korea was annexed by Japan and Emperor Sunjong was forced to abdicate, Yi Un was titled His Highness The Crown Prince of Korea. On 10 June 1926, upon the death of Emperor Sunjong, he became His Highness King Yi of Changdeokgung in Japan. After World War II he was refused entry to Korea, and his Japanese titles were removed by article 14 of the new Constitution of Japan in 1947. In 1920, he married Princess Masako of Nashimoto (born 4 November 1901 ‚Äì ), the eldest daughter of Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, on 28 April 1920 at Tokyo. Early life Yi and It≈ç Hirobumi The prince was born on 20 October 1897 at Deoksu Palace in Seoul as the seventh son of Gojong, the Gwangmu Emperor. His mother was the Honorable Princess Consort Eom Seon-yeong, a palace attendant, who was posthumously awarded the title of Princess Sunheon. He was also the younger half-brother of Emperor Sunjong and Prince Imperial Ui. He was titled Prince Imperial Yeong in 1900, and became the crown prince in 1907, despite being younger than Prince Ui. Prince Ui's support base at court was not strong because his own mother, Lady Jang, had already died. In December 1907, he was taken to Japan on the initiative of It≈ç Hirobumi to be enrolled at Gakush≈´in Peers' School. The move was meant to ensure that the Korean royal family would not take any further anti-Japanese actions following The Hague Secret Emissary Affair.Herbert P.

Military career Article announcing his relationship status with Masako (1917) Photo of Yi on his graduation from the Army War College (Japan) (1923) In September 1911, the prince was enrolled in the second year of the Army Central Youth School, a military preparation school located in Tokyo. He was poor in gymnastics due to his small statue, but excelled in music and martial arts. He was then enrolled in the 29th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, from which he graduated on 25 May 1917 with an excellent record. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry on 25 December, and steadily rose up the ranks, receiving promotions to lieutenant (April 1920), and captain (July 1923). He graduated from the 35th class of the Army Staff College in November 1923 and commanded a battalion of the Guards 2nd Infantry Regiment. He was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office in December 1924, and to the staff of the Chosen Army in July 1926. In May 1927, he was sent on an extensive European tour, visiting France, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Monaco, and returning to Japan in April 1928. In August, he was promoted to major and in August 1929 became commander of the IJA 1st Infantry Regiment. In December 1930, he was assigned to the Inspectorate General of Military Training and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1932. He became colonel in August 1935 and commanded the Utsunomiya-based IJA 59th Infantry Regiment. From April 1937, he served as an instructor at the Army Academy. In July 1938, the prince was promoted to major general and from December was assigned to the staff of the North China Area Army, which was engaged in combat operations in northern China following the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Throughout the first half of 1939, he made extensive inspection tours of front-line units throughout northern Japan, and reviewed Kwantung Army garrison units in Manchukuo. In August, he was appointed commander of the Guards 2nd Brigade and in May 1940 was commander of the reserve Fourth Depot Division. He was promoted to lieutenant general in December. In July 1941, he was appointed commander of the IJA 51st Division. Under his command, the division relocated to Manchukuo to participate in the Special exercise of the Kwantung Army (actually a mobilization for the possible large-scale conflict with the Soviet Union). The preparations for the war with the Soviet Union were officially cancelled in August 1941. In September, the division was transferred to Guangdong under command of IJA 23rd Army. He returned to a post on the staff of the Inspectorate General of Military Training in November. From August 1942, the prince was transferred to the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force and became commander of the 1st Air Army from July 1943. In April 1945, he became a member of the Supreme War Council Later life Following the surrender of Japan, Yi Un lost his royal status under the American Occupation of Japan in 1947. He was also declared stateless, as Korea had become independent of the Empire of Japan, but Korean President Syngman Rhee had refused his request to be allowed to return to Korea with his family. In May 1957, following the end of the American occupation, he acquired Japanese citizenship and travelled to the United States the same month. In March 1959, while still in the United States, he suffered from a stroke. He returned to Japan in May. In 1960, President Rhee again denied him permission to return to Korea, but instead offered the prince the position of Korean Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. He refused on the grounds of illness, but made a trip to New York from June to August 1960, and to Hawaii from March to May 1961. His health deteriorating rapidly, he was hospitalized in Tokyo from August 1961. In November 1963, President Park Chung-hee granted permission for Prince Yi Eun and Crown Princess Bangja to return to Korea. By that time, Prince Yi Eun was unconscious from cerebral thrombosis. He received treatment at St. Mary's Hospital in Seoul. In his final years, Prince Yi Eun lived at Nakseon Hall, Changdeokgung Palace, the former residence of the Korean Imperial Family in Seoul, with Bangja and his younger sister Princess Deokhye. Seven years after returning to his country, he died on 1 May 1970 at Nakseon Hall, Changdeok Palace, Seoul. He was buried at Hongreung in Namyangju, near Seoul; he is known posthumously as Yi Un, Crown Prince Euimin of Korea.

History Monica Stucchi was born in Milan, Italy. Prior to her career in music, she worked as graphic designer. In the early 1980s she started singing in The Watermelon String Band, a bluegrass band led by the banjoist Bruno Guaitamacchi that played in Milan pubs. Stucchi was discovered at age 20 by the Italo producer Roberto Gasparini, who decided to launch her solo career and give her the name Valerie Dore to improve her international appeal. Dore's first single, \\"The Night\\" (1984) arranged by Lino Nicolosi, \\"Get Closer\\" and \\"It's So Easy\\", released in 1984 and 1985, respectively. During this time, the Italian music news publication TV Sorrisi e Canzoni (\\"Smiles and Songs\\") awarded Monica Stucchi alias Valerie Dore the prize of best new artist of year. She also finished second at the Festivalbar music showcase and performed on the TV show \\"Azzurro\\" and on German TV. In 1986, Monica Stucchi changed her collaborator and Dore began working with a new production team at Castello di Carimate on her first album, The Legend. Marco Tansini wrote the music, Simona Zanini wrote lyrics and Monica Stucchi/ Valerie Dore recorded the 10 songs includid in LP. The Legend album's first single, \\"Lancelot,\\" was a hit in Italy. The second single, \\"King Arthur,\\" enjoyed moderate success in Europe, and was performed on the Italian music program Discoring. The songs \\"The Magic Rain\\" and \\"Bow and Arrow\\" were radio hits as well. In 1986, Monica Stucchi/Valerie Dore was voted the 6th best female artist in Italy by readers of TV Sorrisi e Canzoni. The following year, she changed team that don't paied royalties and moved to London to record the single and mix \\"Wrong Direction\\" in co production with her future husband, Mauro Zavagli, for their new disco label \\"MZM PRODUCTION\\" (MauroZavagliMonica Production). Monica sang in studios with German producer Ralph Ruppert and collaborated with musicians Nick Beggs from Kajagoogoo and Marck Price. But in Italy the mobbing was started. The underpromoted record hit #23 in the Italian charts. Between 1990 and 1991, Dore and her husband were in Madagascar where they began a collaboration with a local group. She considered recording a new LP in a Caribbean style, but after some contact with international labels companies, she came to believe that mobbing was horrible. In 1992, the ZYX label released Dore's The Best of Valerie Dore with bonus tracks: the extended versions of her dance hits \\"The Night\\", \\"Get Closer\\" and \\"It's So Easy,\\" plus two remixes of \\"The Night\\" done by DJ Oliver Momm. In 1995, Zavagli and Dore moved to Arezzo, Toscana, and Monica Stucchi alias Valerie Dore start working also as an antiquary and restorer. At the same time, they opened a '800 picture's gallery important store in Milan. Comeback In November 2006, Dore recorded a new song \\"How do I get to Mars?\\" and launched her personal web site www.valeriedore.it (Italian). In 2007, she promoted non-smoking, on \\"Radio 24\\". She had been smoking for 15 years, and it was affecting her voice and shortening her career. She wanted to inspire others to stop smoking as well, and, through radio and in an internet forum, she encouraged abstinence. In 2007 she recorded more material in her home studio, eventually released in the 2014 album Greatest Hits & Remixes. She is preparing new publications.

The town of Shajapur is the district headquarters. Shajapur District is part of the Malwa Plateau. The district is situated in the northwestern part of the state and lies between latitudes 32\\"06' and 24\\" 19' North and longitudes 75\\" 41' and 77\\" 02' East. The district is bounded by Ujjain District to the west, Dewas and Sehore to the south, Rajgarh to the east, and Jhalawar District of Rajasthan to the north. Shajapur district is part of Ujjain Division.Shajapur district in Ujjain division was brought during 1981 census. The district is identified from the Headquarters town Shajapur named after honor of Shahjahan the Mughal Emperor who halted here in 1640. It is said that the original name was Shahjahanpur, which subsequently reduces to Shajapur. Since the formation of the Gwalior state, it has remained a district. History The district was formerly a district of Gwalior State. When Gwalior acceded to the Government of India after Indian Independence in 1947, Shajapur District, along with the rest of Gwalior State, became part of Madhya Bharat. Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh on November 1, 1956. Geography The entire district is a part of the Deccan Traps flood basalts of the Cretaceous-Paleocene. Alluvium of the recent period is, however, found along the river Parbati in a narrow strip. The district has deep black and shallow black brown and alluvial soils of the northern region. Shajapur is a part of central Madhya Pradesh plateau and Ratlam plateau. The physical geography of the district can be sub-divided into the following: Agar-Malwa (Baijnath Dham) This is the western part of the district covering the major areas of Agar malwa tehsil. There is a hill tract in the west of Badod town showing scattered hillocks in a north-south direction. The presence of hills in the center has affected the drainage pattern. The height of this tract varies between 500 and 545 meters above the mean sea level and it slopes towards the north. Dudhaliy and Kachhol are the main streams in the west, originating from the hill tract and draining towards the west. Chhoti Kali Sindh, which is the main perennial stream of the region, flows northwards on the western border of the region. Shajapur forested upland The region stretches from north to south in the middle of the district covering considerable portions of Agar Malwa and Shajapur tehsils and a small part of Susner tehsil. It is a part of the Malwa plateau with typical topography. There is a continuous chain of hills throughout the entire region. The height of the region varies between 450 and 530 meters above the mean sea level. The surface height decreases towards the north. Since it is an upland area, a number of seasonal streams originate from this zone and drain mostly towards the east. Lakundar and Ahu are the main streams flowing from south to north in this region. The streams that join the Lakundar river on its left bank, originate from this hill tract. The Ahu river drains along the western border of the region. The hilly terrain is covered with forest. Kali Sindh basin The Kali Sindh basin stretches between the southern and northern limits of the district. It occupies the major parts of Susner and Shajapur tehsils and a very small part of Agar tehsil. The southern part of the region is hilly whereas the northern part is plain. The hills gradually decrease in height from south to north. There are a few scattered hillocks in the central and northern parts also. The altitude of the region varies between 450 and 528 meters above the mean sea level. Numerous streams originate from the hilly area and dissect the surface. Kali Sindh is the main river, which traverses through the hills and further flows on the eastern border of the district. Lakundar is the main rivulets of Kali Sindh that flows northwards. Geologically the entire region is a part of the Deccan Trap of the Cretaceous Eocene period. Its main helping river is kanthal that is the major source of water in Soyat Kalan. Shajapur upland This region extends over the eastern part of the district covering the entire Shujalpur tehsil and a small segment of Shajapur tehsil. Being a part of the Malwa plateau, it presents a dissected topography. A hill range enters this region from the north and extends towards the south. The southern part of the region is an upland area and northern part is relatively low lying. In the south, the hills are scattered and are eroded by various streams. The height at the region varies between 435 and 507 meters above the main sea level. The 450 meters contour encircles the area along the Newaj river where the small hills are spread, and the Newaj dissects these hills. The eastern part of the region is a low and water dividing line of the western part can be decided by the tributaries of Newaj. The river Newaj and Parbati drains the region. The river Parbati flows northwards on the eastern border of the region while river Newaj flows in the middle of the region. Both the rivers are perennial. Demographics According to the 2011 census Shajapur District has a population of 1,512,681, roughly equal to the nation of Gabon or the US state of Hawaii. This gives it a ranking of 330th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 17.17%. Shajapur has a sex ratio of 939 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 70.17%.

Marked astragali (talus bones) of sheep and goats are common at Mediterranean and Near Eastern archaeological sites, particularly at funeral and religious locations. For example, marked astragali have been found near the altar of Aphrodite Ourania in Athens, Greece, suggesting astragalomancy was performed near the altar after about 500 BC.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art displayed bone \\"dice\\" (hakata) used by the Shona people of southern Africa. They have been in use for thousands of years, and remain extant. Since astragalomancy is a form of sortition, numbers are scrawled into the dice; the numbers are associated with letters, thus bearing on the questions of the diviner.

It is especially used to refer to river islands found on the River Thames and its tributaries in England. Aits are typically formed by the deposit of sediment in the water, which accumulates over a period of time. An ait is characteristically long and narrow, and may become a permanent island should it become secured and protected by growing vegetation. However, aits may also be eroded: the resulting sediment is deposited further downstream and could result in another ait. A channel with numerous aits is called a braided channel. Etymology The word derives from Old English iggath (or igeth); the root of the word, ieg, meaning island, with a diminutive suffix. References in literature Bush Ait on the River Thames in Berkshire. Growing trees and other plants have secured the material that makes up the ait, protecting it from erosion. Although not common in 21st-century English, \\"ait\\" or \\"eyot\\" appears in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Charles Dickens' Bleak House, and Thackeray's Vanity Fair. (Google Ngram Viewer) Joyce Cary used \\"eyot\\" in The Horse's Mouth ‚Äì \\"Sun was in the bank.

It is the only member of the genus Taraba. It is a resident breeder in the tropical New World in southern Mexico, Central America, Trinidad and South America down to northern Argentina and southeastern Brazil. Taxonomy The great antshrike was described by the French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1816 and given the binomial name Thamnophilus major. The current genus Taraba was introduced by the French naturalist Ren√© Lesson in 1831. There are ten recognised subspecies. Description The great antshrike is a large and distinctive antbird, typically 20.3 cm (about 8 inches) long, and weighs 56 g. It has a crest, heavy hooked bill, and brilliant red eyes. The adult male has black upperparts, with two white wingbars and white underparts. There is a white dorsal patch normally concealed except in threat display; young males are similar to the adult, but have rufous wing coverts. The female has rich rufous upperparts and white underparts. Distribution and habitat This is a bird of thickets, cocoa and citrus plantations and sometimes gardens, with a preference for dense undergrowth. It is usually found as territorial pairs. Behaviour The female lays two, sometimes three, grey-marked white eggs in a deep cup nest in a shrub, which are incubated by both sexes for 14 days to hatching. The chicks fledge in another 12 days. The great antshrike feeds on insects and other arthropods gleaned from foliage. It will also take small lizards and mammals. It is a skulking species, which may be located by its song, 30 to 40 musical pook-pook-pook notes, or a snarled churrrr. Sleeping birds are readily located at sites such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre on Trinidad.

He oversaw a massive economic growth of the Pandyan kingdom. On the eve of his death in 1268 CE, the second Pandyan empire's power and territorial extent had risen to its zenith.KA Nilakanta Sastri, p195 Accession Sundara Pandyan I acceded to the Pandyan throne in the year 1251 CE. During the middle part of the 13th century, Pandya kingdom was ruled by many princes of the royal line. This practice of shared rule with one prince asserting primacy was common in the Pandyan Kingdom.KA Nilakanta Sastri, p196 The other princes of the Pandyan royal family with whom Sundara Pandyan I shared his rule were Maravarman Vikkiraman II and his brother Jatavarman Veera Pandyan I.Narasayya, p43 Historical background By the middle of the 13th century, the Chola dynasty which had dominated Southern India over the past three centuries was declining. The last king of the Later Cholas, Rajendra Chola III reigned over a crumbling empire beset with rebellion and increasing external influence from Hoysalas and Kadavas. Previous rulers of the Pandyan kingdom like Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I had succeeded in overthrowing Chola hegemony. Jatavarman annexed Kongu nadu and subdued Lingaya Gounder and made him his vassal. The Hoysala dominance over the Tamil Kingdoms had also waned by the time Sundara Pandyan I took power in 1251. He covered Entire Tamil Nadu which extended up to Nellore of present day Andhra Pradesh. Conquests = Wars against Cheras and Cholas= Sundara Pandyan I first invaded the Chera country ruled by Viraravi Udaya Marthandavarman. The Chera army was defeated and their king killed in battle. Next he turned his attention to Cholas. Rajendra Chola III was defeated and accept Pandyan suzerainty. =Wars against Hoysalas= He invaded Hoysala dominions along the river kaveri and captured the fortress of Kannanur Koppam. Several Hoysala generals including Singana were killed and great amount of loot was captured along with many horses, elephants and women. This invasion was stopped after Someshwara withdrew into his kingdom. A later attempt by Someshwara to invade Pandyan kingdom in 1262 ended in his defeat and death. Jatavarman Veera Pandyan I became the governor of the captured territories. =Wars against Kadavas= Sundara Pandyan besieged the city fortress of Sendamangalam and fought with the Kadava king Kopperunchingan II. However he restored Kopperunchingan to his throne and gave him his country back. He also conquered Magadai and Kongu countries during his campaigns against Kadavas and Hoysalas =Invasion of Sri Lanka= Responding to an appeal for help from a minister in Sri Lanka, Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan intervened in 1258 and made Chandrabhanu of Tambralinga, a Savakan usurper of the Jaffna kingdom submit to Pandyan rule and annually offer precious jewels and elephants in tribute. A second attempt by Chandrabhanu to invade the south of the island from the north prompted the Prince Jatavarman Veera Pandyan I, brother and lieutenant of Sundara Pandyan I to intervene again in 1262-1264 on Sundara Pandyan I's behalf. Chandrabhanu was killed in this conquest and the other king of the island was subjugated. Veera Pandyan I proceeded to plant the Pandyan bull victory flag at Koneswaram temple, Konamalai. Chandrabhanu's son Savakanmaindan was installed and submitted to Pandyan rule on the northern Tamil throne before he too was defeated upon Sundara Pandyan I's son Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I's, invasion in the late 1270s. Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I had succeeded his father as Lord Emperor of Pandyan following the latter's demise in 1268 and invaded to punish the Jaffna monarch for stopping the annual tributes he owed Pandyan. The minister in charge of his invasion, Kulasekara Cinkaiariyan, an Aryachakravarthi, was installed as the new king of the island's north. The Aryacakravarti dynasty line of Jaffna rule thus began. =Expedition to the North= After subduing the Kadava Kopperunchingan II, Sundara Pandyan led an expedition to the North. Pandyan forces killed the Telugu ruler Vijaya Gandagopala and captured Kanchipuram in 1258. This bought them in conflict with the Kakatiyas under Ganapati II. Sundara Pandiyan I defeated a Telugu army at Mudugur in the current Nellore district and performed a virabisheka to commemorate the end of his campaign. However Ganapathi II later defeated Kopperunchingan II who was by then a Pandyan ally and recaptured territories up to Kanchipuram. The Kadava Pallava Kopperinjungan II was followed by very weak successors and Sundara Pandyan annexed Kanchi, Nellore and Visayavadai (modern Vijayawada) regions to the Pandyan Kingdom. Patronage of temples Sundara Pandyan used the vast treasure he got out of his wars to beautify the Siva temple in Chidambaram and the Vishnu temple in Srirangam. For gold plating the roofs of these two temples he was given the title of \\"pon veindha perumal\\"().He also gave many grants to temples in Trichy, Thanjavur and Kanchipuram. He built a temple at Aragalur (Magadai Mandalam) for the merit of Kulasekara around 1259. He acknowledged the contributors of other dynasties to Tamil Nadu by building a gate at the Sri Ranganathaswami Temple at Srirangam in which he engraved the names of all the four great empires of Tamil Nadu namely the Cholas, Pallavas, Pandyas and the Cheras.http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/appendix_d.html He also built the East tower of the Madurai Meenakshi Temple. He gold plated and placed the gold gilded Kalasam atop the gopurum of the Ananda Nilayam vimana of Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. In 1263 CE, he renovated the gopuram of Koneswaram temple and his son Veera Pandyan implanted the Pandyan victory flag and insignia of a \\"Double Fish\\" emblem at Konamalai. Titles Having vanquished his neighbours Sundara Pandyan took the titles like \\"Emmandalamum Kondaruliya Pandiya\\", \\"Tribhuvana Chakravarthy\\", \\"Ponveintha Perumal\\", and \\"Hemachadana Raja\\". His Meikeerthi praises him as \\"the conqueror of Kongu Nadu and Eelam; the conqueror of the Ganges and Kaveri; Vanquisher of Hoysala; Subjugator of Kadava Kopperunchingan I; The one who paid victory tribute and bravery tribute at Chidambaram; The ruler of three worlds\\" (). Death and Succession Sundara Pandyan I was succeeded by Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I in 1268 and died in 1271.

The station is served by the Northern service between Sheffield and Manchester, East Midlands Railway service from Liverpool to Norwich and the TransPennine Express service between Manchester and Cleethorpes, all three running via the Hope Valley Line. History The station in 1960 Station remains in 1998 The station was opened by the Midland Railway, for passengers only, as Dore and Totley on 1 February 1872 (at a building cost of ¬£1517 and ¬£450 for of land) on the then two-year- old Midland Main Line extension from Chesterfield to Sheffield, and was initially served by the local services on this line. The station was then served by six or seven weekday trains and three on Sundays. In 1894 the station became the junction for the new Dore and Chinley line (now the Hope Valley Line). Dore & Totley Station Junction was at the south end of the station and the signal box stood in the angle between the Chesterfield and Chinley lines.OS 1:2500 Second Series Derbyshire sheet XI-12 dated 1898 Between 1901 and 1902, the line between Sheffield station and Dore was widened; the original twin tracks continued to be used by traffic for the Dore and Chinley line and two new tracks were built to the east of this for traffic on the main line to Chesterfield. The original southbound platform was converted to an island platform and a new platform for trains to Chesterfield built to the east. The line from Chesterfield was slewed into its present course to serve the new platforms. A new Dore and Totley Station Junction was made to the north of the station. On 9 October 1907, a Sheffield to Birmingham and Bristol express train ran foul of the points at the station. One of the locomotives hit the platform and overturned. The driver and the second man were thrown from the cab but survived, and the passenger coaches fortunately stayed upright with no passengers injured. Dore and Totley became south Sheffield's only remaining station after the Beeching cuts in the 1960s saw Beauchief, Millhouses and Heeley stations all close. The station was closed to main line traffic and became an unstaffed halt in 1969. It was renamed Dore on 18 March 1971. Subsequently, the island and eastern platforms were demolished in the mid-1980s. Mainline services from the South therefore can no longer stop at the station and the Hope Valley Line now runs single-track (it was singled in March 1985) through the station, with trains in both directions stopping at the one remaining platform. The photograph (right) is taken from the north and shows the remaining platform on the Hope Valley line and none on the main line. The single-track section through the station has become a significant bottleneck, as noted in Network Rail's Yorkshire and Humber Route Utilisation Strategy of 2009. The strategy included proposals to address the problem by re-doubling the track and building a second platform (subject to funding being obtained). South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive has also been lobbying for this problem to be addressed (as noted in its 2006 Rail Strategy documentSYPTE Rail Strategy 2006 p.38 SYPTE website; Retrieved 25 February 2009). The station site had previously been occupied by the Walk Mill; a water-powered mill in operation from the 1280s onwards was used by the monks of Beauchief Abbey to cleanse and thicken cloth. The name Dore and Totley was restored in April 2008 when the station received new Northern Rail branded running in boards. Plans to double the size of the station by 2014 have been delayed. An additional platform and new Disability Discrimination Act 1995-compliant footbridge are to be provided.Railway Herald issue 221 p. 3 Railway Herald; Retrieved 10 May 2010 Construction work began in December 2012 on a new 129-space car-park, which was completed in April 2013.

Plans include a new bridge with passenger lifts and a shelter on the single sided island platform for Manchester bound trains.Hope Valley Capacity Scheme - June 2015 Network Rail website; Retrieved 27 July 2015 This plan is spun out of the original Manchester Hub scheme, now renamed the Northern Hub, incorporating two freight passing loops to be constructed east of Bamford and at Dore South. Once completed an hourly stopping service is hoped to be provided (as stated in the new 2016 Northern franchise agreement), and platforms should be long enough to accommodate 6 car trains, now running on TPE fast services. The Secretary of State at the Department for Transport approved the Capacity Scheme in February 2018http://www.fodats.net/hope- valley-decision-letter.pdf and Network Rail have received tenders for a Design and Build contract that they hope to have confirmed by the Department for Transport before the end of 2020 when the contract can be let. Construction should start in early 2022 with an intention to have it complete by autumn 2023. Any new train services are not expected to be able to operate before the December timetable changes, and possibly later. In May 2019, a canopy was added to the old 1872 station building.

During World War I he flew for Nieuport as a test pilot and was awarded the rank of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Early years Weymann was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on 2 August 1889 of an American father and Haitian mother. It has been suggested that his mother and US-born father were on a liner in Haitian waters at the time of his birth. He spoke fluent English and French and seems to have had dual US & French nationality but resided permanently in France. He died in France in 1976. Inventor =Fabric bodies= After the war Charles Weymann used his knowledge of airframe manufacture to develop a system of making fabric bodies for road vehicles. He opened factories in Paris in 1921, London in 1923 and Indianapolis in 1928. The market for these grew enormously and Weymann licensed his system to many of Europe's most prestigious marques. A change of fashion in the late 1920s led to a demand for gloss painted bodies and the fabric market disappeared. A system was developed using metal panels with a similar flexible mounting allowing movement between panels. It was used on coachbuilt bodies but it did not suit the demands of mass-production. The French factory closed in 1930 followed by Indianapolis in 1931. The British plant had turned to the manufacture of bus bodies and survived (as Metro Cammell Weymann) but Weymann resigned from the company in 1932. =Automatic clutch= He maintained his interest in developing equipment for the automotive industry. In 1963 he obtained a patent for an automatic clutch but it did not meet with commercial success. Weymann returned to aviation with the engineer Georges Lep√®re and continued to design aircraft, such as the Weymann 66 and autogyros at Soci√©t√© des Avions C T Weymann.

The sea between Tobago and Little Tobago is shallow, and glass-bottomed boats enable the attractive corals and brightly coloured tropical fish to be seen on the crossing. It is a popular area for snorkeling and diving, especially on Angel Reef in front of Goat Island. History In 1908 the British politician and businessman Sir William Ingram purchased Little Tobago in order to turn it into a bird sanctuary. The next year he introduced the greater bird of paradise (Paradisaea apoda) to the island in an attempt to save the species from overhunting for the plume trade in its native New Guinea. The bird's plumage was particularly fashionable in women's hats. Forty-seven juvenile birds were introduced to the island, having been transported on a German ocean liner. Ingram hired a middle-aged Swiss sailor by the name of Roberts to manage the sanctuary. Roberts sent updates every few weeks, including sketches of the birds, and descriptive doggerel of them. Roberts, however, died not long thereafter when he fell into the sea whilst inebriatated, expiring a short time later in his island cabin. After Ingram's death in 1924 his heirs deeded the island to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago as a wildlife sanctuary. The birds survived on the island until at least 1958 when they were filmed by a National Geographic crew. There are no reliable records after 1963 when Hurricane Flora hit the island and the population is presumed to be extinct.

His kingdom was centered around the Malwa region in central India, where his capital Dhara-nagara (modern Dhar) was located. Bhoja fought wars with nearly all his neighbours in attempts to extend his kingdom, with varying degrees of success. At its zenith, his kingdom extended from Chittor in the north to upper Konkan in the south, and from the Sabarmati River in the west to Vidisha in the east. Bhoja is best known as a patron of arts, literature, and sciences. The establishment of the Bhoj Shala, a centre for Sanskrit studies, is attributed to him. He was a polymath, and several books covering a wide range of topics are attributed to him. He is also said to have constructed a large number of Shiva temples, although Bhojeshwar Temple in Bhojpur (a city founded by him) is the only surviving temple that can be ascribed to him with certainty. Because of his patronage to scholars, Bhoja became one of the most celebrated kings in the Indian history. After his death, he came to be featured in several legends as a righteous scholar-king. The body of legends clustered around him is comparable to that of the fabled Vikramaditya.  Early life  Bhoja's father and predecessor was Sindhuraja. According to Bhoja-Prabandha, his mother's name was Savitri. Bhoja's reputation as a scholar-king suggests that he was well-educated as a child. The Bhoja- Prabandha states that he was educated by his guardians as well as other learned scholars. According to Bhoja-Prabandha, early in his life, Bhoja suffered from intense headaches. Two Brahmin surgeons from Ujjain made him unconscious using an anaesthetic powder called moha-churna, opened his cranial bone, removed a tumor, and then made him regain his consciousness by administering another powder called sanjivani. = Legend of persecution by Munja = According to Tilaka-Manjari, composed by Bhoja's contemporary Dhanapala, Bhoja's feet had auspicious birthmarks indicating that he was fit to be a king. His uncle Munja (and his father's predecessor) loved him greatly, and appointed him as the king. However, several later legendary accounts state that Munja was initially jealous of Bhoja, and tried to prevent him from becoming a king. For example, the 14th century Prabandha-Chintamani states that during the reign of Munja, an astrologer prophesied Bhoja's long reign. Munja, who wanted his own son to become the king, ordered Bhoja's killing. Bhoja was appointed as the king by the royal ministers after Munja's death. According to a Gujarati legend documented in Rasmala, Munja ordered Bhoja's murder, but later appointed him as the crown prince. Bhoja-Prabandha states that Munja ordered one Vatsaraja to kill Bhoja at the Mahamaya temple in Bhuvaneshvari forest. On hearing Bhoja's cultured manner of talking, Vatsaraja and his men abandoned the murder plan. They faked Bhoja's death, and presented to Munja a fake head and a verse from Bhoja. The verse described how great kings like Mandhata, Rama and Yudhishthira died leaving behind all their property; it then sarcastically added that Munja would be the only one whom the earthly possessions would follow. The verse moved Munja to tears, and made him realize his mistake. When he learned that Bhoja was still alive, he invited Bhoja to back to his court. To repent for his sin, he also went on a pilgrimage to Dharmaranya, where he established a town called Munjapuram. The sarcastic verse, purportedly written by Bhoja to Munja, also appears as an antonymous extract in Sharngadhara-paddhati (1363 CE). These stories of Bhoja's persecution by Munja are essentially mythical. This legend is not found in the works composed by the contemporaries of Munja, Sindhuraja and Bhoja. For example, the Nava-sahasanka-charita makes no mention of this story. The legend appears to be the poetic imagination of later composers. Ain-i- Akbari also contains a variation of this account, but completely distorts the legend, naming Munja as the one who was persecuted by Bhoja. This account is also completely unreliable from a historical point of view.  Anointment  Some literary works suggest that Bhoja succeeded his uncle Munja as the Paramara king. These works include Tilaka-Manjari, Prabandha-Chintamani, and Rasmala. However, several other works as well as epigraphic evidence indicate that Bhoja succeeded his father Sindhuraja. Padmagupta, the court poet of Sindhuraja and Bhoja, also supports this fact. According to Bhoja-Prabandha, Munja left the Paramara administration in hands of Sindhuraja before departing on a military expedition. Munja unexpectedly died in this campaign, and as a result, Sindhuraja succeeded him as the king. Sindhuraja's court poet Padmagupta, in his Nava-Sahasanka-Charita, states that Munja \\"placed the world in Sindhuraja's hands\\" before leaving for Ambika's town. This indicates that he left the administration in Sindhuraja's hands before leaving for his fatal expedition against Tailapa II. Udaipur Prashasti inscription seems to confirm this. = Period of reign = The Modasa copper plates (1010‚Äì11 CE) are the earliest historical record of Bhoja's reign. The Chintamani-Sarnika (1055 CE) was composed by Bhoja's court poet Dasabala. An inscription of Bhoja's successor Jayasimha I is also dated 1055 CE. Thus, 1055 CE can be taken as the last year of Bhoja's reign. Based on these evidences, scholars such as Pratipal Bhatia assign Bhoja's reign to 1010‚Äì1055 CE. However, some scholars assign the beginning of Bhoja's reign variously between 1000 CE and 1010 CE, based on their interpretations of inscriptions and legendary texts. For example, Merutunga's Prabandha-Chintamani states that Bhoja ruled for 55 years, 7 months and 3 days. Based on this, scholars such as D. C. Ganguly and K. C. Jain assign Bhoja's reign to 1000‚Äì1055 CE. However, as K. M. Munshi states, dates are \\"the weakest point in Merutunga's narratives\\". A. K. Warder, who dismisses Merutunga as \\"completely unreliable\\" and his narratives as \\"essentially fiction\\", believes there is no evidence that Bhoja's reign began much earlier than 1010 CE. = Names and titles = In the Paramara inscriptions, Bhoja is mentioned as Bhoja-deva. In some modern north Indian languages such as Hindi, he is also known as \\"Bhoj\\" (because of schwa deletion). Bhoja's inscriptions mention his titles as Parama-bhattaraka, Maharajadhiraja and Parameshvara. Ganaratna Mahodadhi (1140 CE), a work on grammar by Vardhamana, suggests that \\"Tribhuvan Narayana\\" or \\"Triloka Narayana\\" (\\"Lord of the three worlds\\") was also a title of Bhoja. This is corroborated by epigraphic evidence: the Shiva temple ascribed to Bhoja in the Chittor fort has an idol which was named \\"Bhojasvamindeva\\" as well as \\"Tribhuvan Narayanadeva\\".

He inherited a kingdom centered around the Malwa region, and made several attempts to expand it with varying results. The Udaipur Prashasti inscription of Bhoja's brother compares Bhoja to the legendary king Prithu, and states that he \\"ruled the earth from Kailasha to Malaya hills and up to the mountains of the setting and the rising sun\\". This is an obvious exaggeration: historical evidence indicates that Bhoja's kingdom extended from Chittor in the north to upper Konkan in the south, and from the Sabarmati River in the west to Vidisha in the east. Several legends mention conflicts between the ruler of Malwa and the Chaulukyas, during the reign of the Chaulukya kings Vallabha-raja and Durlabha-raja. Vallabha is said to have died of smallpox during an expedition against the Paramaras. This incident may have happened during the early part of Bhoja's reign, or during the reign of his father Sindhuraja. Vallabha's successor Durlabha is said to have repulsed an attack by a confederacy that included the ruler of Malwa, but modern historians doubt the authenticity of this legend. Bhoja's first military aggression appears to be his invasion of the Lata region (in present-day Gujarat), around 1018 CE. Bhoja subjugated the Chalukyas of Lata, whose ruler Kirtiraja may have served as his feudatory for a brief period. Bhoja's invasion of Lata brought him close to the Shilahara kingdom of northern Konkana, which was located to the south of Lata. Bhoja invaded and captured Konkana sometime between 1018 and 1020 CE, during the reign of the Shilahara king Arikesari. He celebrated this victory in a big way by making generous donations to Brahmins. His 1020 CE inscription states that he organized a Konkana-Grahana Vijaya Parva (\\"Konkan Victory Festival\\"). The Shilaharas probably continued to administer Konkana as Bhoja's vassals. By the end of his reign, Bhoja had lost this territory to the Chalukyas of Kalyani. Sometime before 1019 CE, Bhoja formed an alliance against the Chalukyas of Kalyani with Rajendra Chola and Gangeyadeva Kalachuri. At this time, Jayasimha II was the Chalukya king. The triple alliance engaged the Chalukyas at their northern and southern frontiers simultaneously. The extent of Bhoja's success in this campaign is not certain, as both Chalukya and Paramara panegyrics claimed victory. Historian D. C. Ganguly believes that Bhoja achieved some early victories against the Chalukyas, but was ultimately defeated. Others, including D. B. Diskalkar and H. C. Ray, believe that Bhoja was defeated by Jayasimha after some early successes, but ultimately emerged victorious against the Chalukyas after 1028 CE. According to Georg B√ºhler, the struggle probably ended with some advantage for Bhoja, which might have been exaggerated into a great victory by the Paramara poets. The Udaipur Prashasti states that Bhoja defeated a ruler named Indraratha. Modern historians identify this king with Indranatha, the Somavamshi king of Kalinga. This king was defeated by Rajendra Chola: Bhoja may have played a secondary role in the Chola campaign as part of an alliance. The Ghaznavids, a Muslim dynasty of Turkic origin, invaded north-western India in the 11th century, led by Mahmud of Ghazni. The Udaipur Prashasti claims that Bhoja's mercenaries defeated the Turushkas (Turkic people). There are some legendary accounts of Bhoja's military successes against the foreign invaders identified with the Ghaznavids. However, there is no clear evidence to show that Bhoja fought against the Ghaznavids or any other Muslim army. Bhoja might have contributed troops to the Kabul Shahi ruler Anandapala's fight against the Ghaznavids. He is believed to have granted asylum to Anandapala's son Trilochanapala. Several medieval Muslim historians state that Mahmud avoided a confrontation with a powerful Hindu ruler named Param Dev after sacking the Somnath Hindu temple. Modern historians identify Param Dev as Bhoja: the name may be a corruption of Paramara-Deva or of Bhoja's title Parameshvara-Paramabhattaraka. Bhoja may have also been a part of the Hindu alliance that expelled Mahmud's governors from Hansi, Thanesar and other areas around 1043 CE. Bhoja's attempt to expand his kingdom eastwards was foiled by the Chandela king Vidyadhara. However, Bhoja was able to extend his influence among the Chandela feudatories, possibly after Vidyadhara's death. The Kachchhapaghatas of Dubkund, who were the northern neighbours of the Paramaras, were originally Chandela feudatories. However, their ruler Abhimanyu accepted Bhoja's suzerainty. According to the Udaipur Prashasti inscription, Bhoja defeated the Gurjara king. The identity of this king is debated by the historians, but he is generally identified as a weak Gurjara-Pratihara ruler of Kannauj. Bhoja did not retain control of Kannauj for a long time, if at all. The 1046 CE Tilakawada copper plate inscription states that Bhoja's general Suraditya stabilized his royal fortune by slaughtering one Sahavahana in a battle. Some earlier historians identified Sahavahana as a king of Chamba, but this identification is doubtful, considering the distance between Chamba and Malwa, and the fact that the ruler of Chamba was not powerful enough to destabilize Bhoja's kingdom. Sahavahana might been a general of one of Bhoja's rivals, possibly the Kalachuri king Karna. Bhoja defeated and killed Viryarama, the Shakambhari Chahamana ruler. Encouraged by this success, he also waged a war against the Chahamanas of Naddula. But in this second campaign, his army was forced to retreat, and his general Sadha was killed. During the last years of Bhoja's reign, sometime after 1042 CE, Jayasimha's son and successor Someshvara I invaded Malwa, and sacked his capital Dhara. Multiple Chalukya inscriptions dated between 1058 and 1067 CE state that the Chalukyas plundered the important Paramara cities, including Dhara, Ujjayini and Mandapa. Bhoja re-established his control over Malwa soon after the departure of the Chalukya army. Nevertheless, the defeat was a major setback for the Paramaras, and pushed back the southern boundary of their kingdom from Godavari to Narmada. Although the Bhoja and Kalachuri king Gangeya were part of an alliance against the Chalukyas, Bhoja defeated Gangeya. It is not certain when they turned into enemies. According to one theory, Bhoja defeated Gangeya before his Chalukya campaign, in which Gangeya must have fought as a Paramara vassal. A contradictory theory is that the two turned enemies after their Chalukya campaign, sometime between 1028 CE and 1042 CE. The Udaipur Prashasti also claims that Bhoja defeated one Togglala, who might have been Gangeya's predecessor Kokalla II.  Death  During the last year of Bhoja's reign, or shortly after his death, the Chaulukya king Bhima I and the Kalachuri king Karna attacked his kingdom. According to the 14th century author Merutunga, Bhoja had once thought of subjugating Bhima, but Bhima's diplomat avoided a Paramara invasion by instigating Bhoja against the Chalukyas of Kalyani instead. Sometime before 1031 CE, Bhima launched an expedition against the Paramara branch at Abu, forcing its ruler Dhandhuka to seek shelter with Bhoja. Hemachandra, who was patronized by the Chaulukyas, states that Bhoja's general Kulachandra once sacked the Chaulukya capital while Bhima was fighting a war at the Sindh frontier. Bhima later dispatched his soldiers to raid Malwa several times. Merutunga's Prabandha-Chintamani states that once two such soldiers attacked Bhoja in the vicinity of his capital Dhara, but the Paramara king escaped unhurt. Merutunga also states that Karna once challenged Bhoja to either a war or a palace-building contest. Bhoja, who was an old man by this time, chose the second option. Bhoja lost this contest, but refused to accept Karna's suzerainty. As a result, Karna, in alliance with Bhima, invaded Malwa. According to Merutunga, Bhoja died of a disease at the same time the allied army attacked his kingdom. Several literary works written under Chaulukya patronage suggest that Bhima subjugated Bhoja while Bhoja was still alive. However, such claims are not corroborated by historical evidence.  Cultural contributions  The incomplete Bhojeshwar Temple in Bhojpur, Madhya Pradesh Bhoja is best remembered for his intellect and patronage to cultural activities. Noted poets and writers of his time sought his sponsorship. The Kashmiri writer Bilhana famously rued that Bhoja died before him, because of which he failed to seek the king's patronage. Several later kings also emulated Bhoja. For example, Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire styled himself as Abhinava-Bhoja (\\"the new Bhoja\\") and Sakala-Kala-Bhoja (\\"Bhoja of all the arts\\"). Bhoja was himself a polymath. Under his rule, MƒÅlwa and its capital Dhara became one of the chief intellectual centres of India. He is said to have paid great attention to the education of his people, so much so that even humble weavers in the kingdom are supposed to have composed metrical Sanskrit kavyas. Bhoja is said to have founded the city of Bhojpur, a belief supported by historical evidence. Besides the Bhojeshwar Temple there, the construction of three now-breached dams in that area is attributed to him. The temple originally stood on the banks of a reservoir 18.5 long and 7.5 miles wide. This reservoir was formed through construction of 3 earth-and-stone dams during Bhoja's reign. The first dam, built on Betwa River, trapped the river waters in a depression surrounded by hills. A second dam was constructed in a gap between the hills, near present-day Mendua village. A third dam, located in present-day Bhopal, diverted more water from the smaller Kaliasot river into the Betwa dam reservoir. This man-made reservoir existed until 15th century, when Hoshang Shah emptied the lake by breaching two of the dams. Bhoja established the Bhoj Shala which was a centre for Sanskrit studies and a temple of Sarasvatƒ´ in present-day Dhar. According to folklore, the Bhopal city was established by and named after him (\\"Bhojpal\\"), but it is possible that the city derives its name from another king called Bhupala (or Bhupal).CPI joins campaign against naming Bhopal as Bhojpal. Daily Bhaskar, 16 March 2011. =Literary works= Bhoja was renowned as a scholar-king, and several books are attributed to him. Because these books cover an enormous range of topics, it is not certain if he actually wrote all these books or if he only commissioned these works, acting as a patron of their actual writers. But it is known that he was an expert on poetry, and the treatise Shringara- Prakasha was definitely authored by him. According to Ajada, who wrote a commentary titled Padaka-prakasha on Sarasvati-Kanthabharana, Bhoja wrote 84 books. The surviving works attributed to Bhoja include the following Sanskrit- language texts (IAST titles in bracket): * Bhujabala-bhima (Bhujabalabhƒ´ma), a work on astrology * Champu-Ramayana or Bhoja-Champu (Camp≈´rƒÅmƒÅya·πáa), a re- telling of the Ramayana in mixture of prose and poetry, which characterises the champu genre. The first five kandas (chapters) are attributed to Bhoja. The sixth and seventh chapters were completed by Lakshmana and Venkatadhvarin respectively. * Charucharya (CƒÅrucƒÅrya), a treatise on personal hygiene * Govinda-vilasa, poem * Nama-Malika, a compiled treatise on lexicography * Raja-Marta·πÖda (RƒÅjamƒÅrtan·∏ça) or Patanjali-Yogasutra-Bhashya, a major commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali; includes an explanation of various forms of meditations * Raja-Mriganka-Karana (RƒÅjamrigankakara·πÖa), a treatise on chemistry, especially dealing with the extraction of metals from ores, and production of various drugs. * Samarangana-Sutradhara (SamarƒÅ·πága·πáas≈´tradhƒÅra), a treatise on architecture and iconography. It details construction of buildings, forts, temples, idols of deities and mechanical devices including a so-called flying machine or glider. * Sarasvati-Kanthabharana (Sarasvatƒ´ka·πá·π≠habhara·πáa), a treatise on Sanskrit grammar for poetic and rhetorical compositions. Most of it is a compilation of works by other writers. Some of the poetic examples provided by him in this work are still appreciated as the highest cream of Sanskrit poetry. * Shalihotra (≈öƒÅlihotra), a book on horses, their diseases and the remedies * Shringara-Prakasha (≈ö·πõ·πÖgƒÅraprakƒÅ≈õa), treatise on poetics and dramaturgy * Sringara-Manjari-Katha (≈ö·πõ·πÖgƒÅramanjarƒ´kathƒÅ), a poem composed in akhyayika form * Tattva-Prakasha (TattvaprƒÅka≈õa), a treatise on Shaivite philosophy. It provides a synthesis of the voluminous literature of the siddhanta tantras * Vidvajjana-Vallabha, treatise on astronomy * Vyavahara-Manjari (VyavahƒÅramanjarƒ´), a work on dharma≈õƒÅstra or Hindu law * Yukti-Kalpataru, a work dealing with several topics including statecraft, politics, city-building, jewel-testing, characteristics of books, ship-building etc. The Prakrit language poems Kodanda-Kavya and Kurma-Sataka are also attributed to Bhoja. The Kodanda-Kavya (Koda·πÖ·∏çakƒÅvya) was found inscribed on stone slab fragments at Mandu. The Kurma-Sataka (Avanik≈´rma≈õataka), which praises the Kurma (tortoise) incarnation of Vishnu, was found inscribed at the Bhoj Shala in Dhar. Sangitaraja, attributed to Kalasena or Kumbha, names Bhoja as an authority on music, which suggests that Bhoja also compiled or wrote a work on music.  Religion  Samadhishvara Shiva Temple in Chittor Fort is identified with the Tribhuvana-Narayana or Bhoja-svamin temple attributed to Bhoja. The original temple has been renovated several times since its construction. Historical evidence suggests that Bhoja was a devotee of Shiva. His writings qualify Shiva as \\"Jagadguru\\" (\\"World teacher\\"), and his inscriptions begin with verses praising Shiva. The Udaipur Prashasti inscription of the later Paramara rulers states that Bhoja \\"covered the earth with temples\\" dedicated to the various aspects of Shiva, including Kedareshvara, Rameshwara, Somanatha, Kala, and Rudra. The Jain writer Merutunga, in his Prabandha-Chintamani, states that Bhoja constructed 104 temples in his capital city of Dhara alone. However, the Bhojeshwar Temple in Bhojpur is the only surviving shrine that can be attributed to Bhoja with certainty. Several historians, including G. H. Ojha and R. Nath, have identified the Samadhishvara Shiva Temple in Chittor with the Tribhuvana Narayana Shiva or Bhoja-svamin temple attributed to Bhoja; the temple has been restored several times since its construction. The Jain legends state that Bhoja converted to Jainism. According to this account, his court poet Dhanapala convinced the king to give up Vedic animal sacrifices. The poet also openly ridiculed Bhoja's other religious beliefs, including his worship of Kamadeva-Rati and cow. Gradually, Dhanapala convinced Bhoja to become a Jain. These accounts of Bhoja's conversion to Jainism are irreconcilable with historical evidence. In a Bhoja-Prabandlha legend, a Brahmin named Govinda calls Bhoja a Vaishnavite. It is possible that Bhoja patronized other faiths despite being a Shaivite.  Personal life  Bhoja married multiple women as part of matrimonial alliances with other ruling dynasties. His chief queen was Liladevi or Lilavati. His other queens included Padmavati (princess of Kuntala), Chandramukhi (princess of Anga) and Kamala. Inscriptional evidence suggests that he was succeeded by Jayasimha, who was probably his son. Jayasimha's Mandhata grant of 1055 CE mentions his predecessors as Bhoja, Sindhuraja and Vakpati. However, this inscription does not specify the relationship between Bhoja and Jayasimha, and it is the only epigraph that mentions a Paramara king named Jayasimha. The Udaipur Prashasti and Nagpur Prashasti inscriptions of the later Paramara kings give a detailed genealogy of the Paramara kings, but do not mention Jayasimha. These two inscriptions name Udayaditya as the next ruler after Bhoja. Udayaditya is now known to be Bhoja's brother.  Legends  In terms of the number of legends centered around him, Bhoja is comparable to the fabled Vikramaditya. Sheldon Pollock describes Bhoja as \\"the most celebrated poet-king and philosopher-king of his time, and perhaps of any Indian time\\". Bhoja came to be featured in several legends as a righteous scholar-king, who was the ultimate judge of literary qualities and generously rewarded good poets and writers. Most of these legends were written three to five centuries after his death. Apart from epigraphic records, much of the information about Bhoja comes from these legendary accounts, including Merutunga's Prabandha-Chintamani (14th century), Rajavallabha's Bhoja-Charitra (15th century), and Ballala's Bhoja-Prabandha (17th century). However, many of the popular legends about Bhoja do not have any historical basis. For example, the Bhoja-Prabandha anachronistically describes the ancient poet Kalidasa as a contemporary of Bhoja. In order to enhance their imperial claims, the Paramaras promoted several legends associating Bhoja with the ancient legendary kings. For example, in Simhasana Dvatrimsika (popularly known as Singhasan Battisi), Bhoja finds a throne of Vikramaditya, and each of the 32 divine figurines attached to the throne tell him a story about Vikramaditya. A Bhavishya Purana legend describes Bhoja as a descendant of Vikramaditya and Shalivahana. According to this legend, the mleccha (foreign) influence had corrupted Indian culture by the time of Bhoja's ascension. Bhoja marched up to the banks of the Indus river, and defeated several mleccha kings. The poet Kalidasa, who accompanied him, magically turned into ashes a mleccha named Mahamada, whose followers came to be known as Muslim (The character Mahamada is based on Muhammad possibly combined with Mahmud of Ghazni). After returning to his capital, Bhoja established Sanskrit language among the top three varnas and Prakrit language among the Shudras. During his 50-year reign, Aryavarta (the land between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas) became a blessed land where the varna system was established. On the other hand, caste mixture took place beyond the Vindhyas (that is, in South India). Again, this is an imaginary account not supported by any historical evidence.

Plot  Brian begins an unwilling symbiotic relationship with a malevolent leech-like brain-eating parasite called \\"Aylmer\\". Aylmer secretes a highly addictive, hallucinogenic blue fluid into Brian's brain. In return for a steady supply of the fluid, Brian must seek out human victims for Aylmer, so that he can eat their brains. All the while, though, as Brian adopts a heavily secluded life in his indulgence of Aylmer's fluids, it begins to draw a rift in his relationship with his girlfriend Barbara and his brother Mike. The film climaxes with Brian allowing Aylmer to kill Barbara, soon after which he is confronted by Morris and Martha, a middle aged couple who were Aylmer's previous hosts before he escaped and found Brian. Holding Brian at gun point, they retrieve Aylmer from his back, but Aylmer fights back and kills them both. But while Aylmer is feeding Brian his next dosage, Morris, who is still alive, fiercely grabs Aylmer and accidentally squeezes an overdose of his juice into Brian's brain, causing him severe agony as it goes in to overload. Aylmer dies and Morris succumbs to his injuries while Brian, still in agony from the overdose, retrieves Morris's gun and shoots himself in the head after returning to the apartment he shares with Mike. The movie concludes with the police bursting in on Brian, not dead from the gunshot but now with a glowing hole in his head.

The product line includes various subbrands of biotechnology products, such as machines and consumables for polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcription, cloning, culturing, stem cell production, cell therapy, regenerative medicine, immunotherapy, transfection, DNA/RNA purification, diagnostic tests, antibodies, and immunoassays. The predecessor corporation was Invitrogen Corporation (formerly traded as ), headquartered in Carlsbad, California. In 2008, a merger between Applied Biosystems and Invitrogen. was finalized, creating Life Technologies. The latter was acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific in 2014. History =Founding= Invitrogen was founded in 1987 by Lyle Turner, Joe Fernandez, and William McConnell and was incorporated in 1989. The company initially found success with its kits for molecular cloning‚Äînotably, The Librarian, a kit for making cDNA libraries, and the FastTrack Kit for mRNA isolation from biological samples. William McConnell left the company in 1989. In 1999, the company, which had reached sales of $33 million the prior year, went public, with a plan of consolidating biotechnology research boutique suppliers. The company had become quite successful at licensing technologies into its niche market, of cloning and expression, but determined that many niche leaders were not interested in licensing, and M&A; needed to be added to the company's set of tools for growth. =Mergers and acquisitions= Invitrogen acquired NOVEX, a leader in cloned protein characterization, within 60 days of going public. In December 1999, it purchased Research Genetics, Inc., a leader in genomics and synthetic DNA chemistry, becoming a $100 million (annual sales) company within a year of its IPO. The business scope expanded significantly when it acquired the rival biotechnology and cell culture company Life Technologies in 2000; Life had been formed in 1983 when GIBCO (Grand Island Biological Company) which had been founded around 1960 in New York, merged with a reagent company called Bethesda Research Laboratories. The company continued to add technologies through a series of mergers and acquisitions, which broadened its customer base and strengthened its intellectual property portfolio. Among these, established companies such as Ethrog Biotechnology, Molecular Probes (fluorescence-based detection), Dynal (magnetic bead‚Äìbased separation), Panvera (proteins and assays for drug screening), InforMax (software for computational biology and bioinformatics), BioSource (cellular pathway analysis), CellzDirect (cell products and services for research) and Zymed and Caltag Laboratories (primary and secondary antibodies) have been brought under the Invitrogen brand. Invitrogen acquired Sequitur in 2003 to obtain Sequitur's proprietary Stealth(TM) RNAi technology. In 2008, Invitrogen virtually doubled its size with the purchase of biotech instrumentation company Applied Biosystems, maker of DNA sequencing and PCR machines and reagents. The company then renamed the overall organization as Life Technologies. The Invitrogen brand and most of the brands acquired still exist on product packaging, although the overall company is called Life Technologies. In summer 2010, the company acquired the computer chip DNA sequencing company Ion Torrent Systems. Through this history of acquisitions and continued product research and development, Invitrogen / Life Technologies had over 50,000 products. Portfolio =Key products and technologies= Utilizing this business strategy, Invitrogen represented a large number of products: Dynabeads magnetic separation technology, GIBCO cell culture media and reagents, SuperScript reverse transcriptase, Platinum Taq polymerase, TOPO cloning and expression products, Novex protein electrophoresis products, and numerous fluorescent reagents such as Qdot nanocrystals, Alexa Fluor, DyLight, RiboGreen and SYBR dyes. Invitrogen currently offers more than 25,000 products and services to support research in cellular analysis, genomics, proteomics, and drug discovery, and seeks to leverage their extensive technology portfolio to address research problems in developing fields, including biodefense and environmental diagnostics, bioinformatics, epigenetics, and stem cell research. =Innovation and impact= Under a contract from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the company developed a prototype hand-held pathogen detection system for the detection of multiple toxins such as ricin, staphylococcal enterotoxin, and botulinum toxin, as well as bacteria that cause anthrax, plague, and other diseases, in a single sample.Invitrogen Delivers Prototype Handheld Biothreat Detector .

France, in a tradition dating from the 17th century. The famous silk laces were introduced in the 18th century. Chantilly lace, was also produced in the 19th century but this one was actually made not in Chantilly area but in the French Norman town Bayeux and in Geraardsbergen, now in Belgium. Chantilly lace is known for its fine ground, outlined pattern, and abundant detail. The pattern is outlined in cordonnet, a flat untwisted strand. The best Chantilly laces were made of silk, and were generally black, which made them suitable for mourning wear. White Chantilly lace was also made, both in linen and silk, though most Chantilly laces were made of silk. The black silk Chantilly lace became especially popular, and there was a large market for it in Spain and the Americas. Chantilly and the Spanish laces (such as blonde lace) were the most popular black laces. Little white Chantilly was ever made. Another notable thing about Chantilly lace is the use of a half-and-whole stitch as a fill to achieve the effect of light and shadow in the pattern, which was generally of flowers. The background, or r√©seau, was in the form of a six pointed star, and was made of the same thread as the pattern, unlike the otherwise similar blonde lace. The lace was produced in strips approximately four inches wide, and then joined with a stitch that left no visible seam. Chantilly lace remained popular in the 19th century, when every fashionable lady had a black or white Chantilly shawl, made in Brussels or Ghent. History In the 17th century, the Duchesse de Longueville organised the manufacture of lace at Chantilly. It has been produced from then until the present day. It became popular because of the duchesse's patronage and Chantilly's proximity to Paris and came into fashion again during the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI; it was a special favorite of Louis XV's last mistress, Mme du Barry, and of Marie Antoinette. When the French Revolution began in 1789, demand for the lace ceased. The lace-makers were seen as prot√©g√©s of the royals, and after Mme du Barry and Marie Antoinette were guillotined in 1793, the lace-makers of Chantilly were themselves killed. At this point production ceased. Napoleon I sponsored a revival of Chantilly lace between the years 1804 and 1815. At this point production was concentrated in Normandy, mainly around the Bayeux area. While it was no longer being made in Chantilly, all of the old techniques and designs were used. Chantilly lace reached the height of its popularity around 1830 and was revived again in the 1860s, at which point it was made at Bayeux as well as at Geraardsbergen, in what is nowadays Belgium. In 1844, a machine was patented that made Valenciennes lace and black silk Chantilly lace that was difficult to distinguish from the handmade lace.

The work received its world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera on 14 December 1918. Background Around 1904, Puccini first began planning a set of one- act operas, largely because of the success of Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana.Ashbrook, p. 170 Originally, he planned to write each opera to reflect one of the parts of Dante's Divine Comedy. However, he eventually based only Gianni Schicchi on Dante's epic poem.Fisher, p. 13 The link in the final work is that each opera deals with the concealment of a death. Puccini also intended that the three should be performed as a set, and wrote to Casa Ricordi to complain about their giving permission in 1920 to The Royal Opera, London, \\"for Tabarro and Schicchi without Angelica\\". He reluctantly agreed that the two operas could be given in a programme with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but when he heard that Il tabarro had also been dropped, he wrote to his friend Sybil Seligman to say \\"I very much dislike Trittico being given in bits ‚Äì I gave permission for two operas, and not one, in conjunction with the Russian Ballet.\\" Osborne, pp. 220‚Äì221 Today, it is quite common to see only one or two of the trittico operas performed in an evening, and sometimes one of them may be paired with another one-act opera by a different composer. Performance history The operas premiered at the Metropolitan Opera on 14 December 1918. The critical reviews for Il trittico were mixed; most critics agreed that Gianni Schicchi was the best of the three operas.Wilson, p. 178 Il trittico premiered in Rome on 11 January 1919. Puccini, who had not been present for the New York premiere, attended the production at the Rome Opera House. The Rome production, especially Gianni Schicchi, received positive reviews. Later that year, the triptych was staged at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires (25 June) with Tullio Serafin conducting and in Chicago (6 December). After these initial premieres, most opera companies began to perform the operas separately; Gianni Schicchi would eventually become the most frequently performed of the set.Ashbrook 1985, 174‚Äì6 A critically acclaimed production at the Metropolitan Opera opened on 20 April 2007, directed by Jack O'Brien and was broadcast on television by PBS's Great Performances at the Met series. In this production Il tabarro was moved from 1910 to 1927, Suor Angelica was moved from the 17th century to 1938, and Gianni Schicchi was moved from 1299 to 1959. Synopses A complete synopsis of each opera may be found in their individual articles =Il tabarro= :Place: A barge on the Seine in Paris. :Time: 1910. The opera is dark and brooding, with the violence and grit associated with verismo opera. =Suor Angelica= :Place: A convent near Siena. :Time: The latter part of the 17th century. This second opera, Puccini's personal favoriteSimon, p. 396 (but usually the one to be omitted if only two of the operas are performed), is an uplifting tale of religious redemption. =Gianni Schicchi= :Place: Florence. :Time: 1299. The third opera is the most popular, a farce full of greed and conniving.

The Wolof, the largest ethnic group in Senegal, have a distinctive musical tradition that, along with the influence of neighboring Fulani, Tukulor, Serer, Jola, and Malinke cultures, has contributed greatly to popular Senegalese music, and to West African music in general. Wolof music takes its roots from the Serer musical tradition, particularly from the Serer pre-colonial Kingdom of Saloum. Virtually all Wolof musical terminology including musical instruments comes from the Serer language.Masters of the sabar: Wolof griot percussionists of Senegal. Page 46. By Patricia Tang Griot Tradition Wolof musicians were traditionally drawn from the griots (g√©w√©l), or of the blacksmith caste (t√´gg), who were masters of drumming. Griots taught history, ethics and religion using their songs and recitations, and were employed by powerful members of the community as praise-singers and historians. Today many modern Wolof musicians still come from Griot families. After the 19th century conversion of major Wolof kingdoms to Islam, the tagg, or ode song in Wolof, was reused in an Islamic Nasheed tradition--an important integration of pre-Islamic style into the new Muslim paradigm.

It is a bedroom community of Saskatoon. It is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Corman Park No. 344. The community is served by the Saskatoon/Richter Field Aerodrome located immediately west of the city across Highway 12. History In 1939, Isaac and Dave Martens purchased land north of Saskatoon. They then sold three small parcels of land to people who wanted to move out of Saskatoon and, as a result, the community of Martensville was created. Many Mennonites who worked in Saskatoon chose to live there to retain connections to the large Mennonite community of the Hague-Osler area. Martensville was later incorporated as a village in 1966 and as a town three years later in 1969. Sewer and water was established in 1976 with the town experiencing accelerated growth. In 2009, Martensville was incorporated as a city. Demographics According to the 2016 Canadian census, the population of the Martensville is approximately 9,645, making the city the eleventh largest city in the province. The city was granted city status on November 3, 2009. In Saskatchewan, communities may apply for and be granted city status once they achieve and maintain a permanent population of 5,000 (Melville is at present an exception). The 2006 census showed a population below this threshold, but growth calculations indicated the population had surpassed 5,000 by 2009. Geography Martensville, located between the North Saskatchewan River and South Saskatchewan River, is between to above sea level. Martensville is located just north of the moist mixed grasslands area typical of Saskatoon, and locates instead in an ecoregion of aspen parkland. It is located just north of Saskatoon, and southwest of Clarkboro Ferry, which crosses the South Saskatchewan River. The 10 km distance between Martensville and Warman is the closest between two chartered cities in the province. By comparison, Martensville is approximately 18 km north of downtown Saskatoon, its next closest neighbour. Patches of Aspen trees surrounded by wheat fields in the summer. Martensville is in a dry- prairie/savanna biome and experiences warm summers and very cold winters. Martensville has four distinct seasons. Average temperatures range from ‚àí17 ¬∞C in January to 18 ¬∞C in July. Martensville is fairly dry; with the summer being the wettest season. It belongs to the continental climate region of Canada which typifies warm summers according to the K√∂ppen climate classification. The geology of the area are sandy plains which resulted from shorelines of glacial lakes and depositions from glacial lakes as the Laurentide Ice Sheet left the area. There are no large lakes in this area due to the sandy soils which drained away melting glacial waters. The lakes in this area are remnants of the South Saskatchewan river channels. Government Martensville has a mayor as the highest ranking government official. Kent Muench currently holds the position as mayor of Martensville, having been sworn in on November 6, 2012.http://www.martensville.ca/index.aspx?NID=27 They also elects aldermen or councillors to form the municipal council. Provincially Martensville is within the Martensville-Warman constituency served by their MLA, who is currently Nancy Heppner. Martensville is represented in the House of Commons of Canada by MP of the Carlton Trail‚ÄîEagle Creek riding; currently it is held by Kelly Block of the Conservative Party. The city does not have its own police service and is in contract with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for protective services along with Corman Park Police Service and the Saskatoon Police Service, who provide additional assistance when needed. Education Martensville received its first school in 1953. Martensville is served by three public elementary schools, one catholic elementary school and one high school in the Prairie Spirit School Division. Valley Manor Elementary School is located on the south side of Martensville, while Venture Heights Elementary School Lake Vista elementary school is connected to Holy Mary Catholic School, and they are located in the North east corner of the city. and the Martensville High School are both located on the north side. Each school has an enrollment of over seven hundred students. In the spring of 2008, CA$698,000 was allocated for portable classrooms at Valley Manor and Venture Heights Schools. A new public K-8 school will be opening for the 2017‚Äì2018 school year. Lake Vista Public School will be able to accommodate 450 students and is located in the new Lake Vista neighborhood. Historically pupils were served by the Halcyonia School District #1237 one-room school house at South West Section 28 township 40 Range 8 W of the 3 meridian, which was established by the historical Rural Municipality number 384. Some pupils may have attended Virtue one-room school house #2616, which was built at a later date at Tsp 38 Rge 6 W of the 3 meridian. In 2010, Catholic residents in Martensville formed a local Catholic school division which amalgamated with Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools shortly thereafter. It was revealed on June 23, 2015, that the division's new elementary school in Martensville will be named Holy Mary Catholic School and it is expected to be complete by 2017. Points of interest The city has seven lakes that are connected through a series of canals. The lakes and creeks are part of the Opimihaw Creek system. The lakes were created for water retention but are also used for a variety of year-round recreational activities including perch fishing, canoeing, and skating. The city has a new outdoor pool facility that opened in the summer of 2010. The facility includes a six-lane junior olympic-sized pool, a zero-depth entry pool, and a toddler pool. There are four waterslides and several spray features. It has a full-service concession and is right next to the community centre. Wanuskewin Heritage Park, a Provincial Heritage Property and interpretive centre, is located from Martensville, and the Sutherland Bird Sanctuary is within . See the article on Saskatoon for additional regional points of interest shared with Martensville. =Arts and culture= Martensville holds its annual Buster Days festival every June, usually in the first or second week. Buster Days is a 3-day festival that includes a parade, dances, softball, and, as of 2005, a volleyball tournament. Before 2005, a small exhibition took place that offered amusement rides, games, and food. Otherwise, its close proximity to Saskatoon - in particular the SaskTel Center - allows residents easy access to that city's events and attractions. Sports Sports venues in Martensville include a kart racing track (Saskatoon Kart Racers), the North Ridge Centennial Centre, Chrome Dome Park (ball diamonds and soccer pitches and Geransky multipurpose field), Kinsmen Park (tennis, skate park, walking trails, ball diamonds, tobogan hill), North Hills Park, Sport Centre (rink where the Marauders. play hockey and curling rink), aquatic facility and various neighbourhood parks. Adjacent to Kinsmen Park is the Martensville Athletic Pavilion. The Athletic Pavilion is a multipurpose indoor 50,000 square foot athletic facility. The Athletic Pavilion features various court spaces and multi-purpose rooms, a running track and fitness gym in addition to a reception area and concession. Martensville also hosts the Martensville Mustangs, who are a part of the Martensville Minor Baseball Association (MMBA), as well as the Martensville Maddogs football team and the high school team Martensville Royals. The city used to have a small golf course, but in May 2008 it was demolished to make way for new houses and a public swimming pool. Martensville's bowling alley was also closed in 2008, and replaced by a gym in late 2009. In the summer of 2008, the former bowling alley was used as a filming location for the second season of the Canadian television show, Rabbit Falls. Infrastructure Several major trucking routes radiate north from Saskatoon; Idylwyld Drive North, Highway 11 (Louis Riel Trail) to Prince Albert via Warman , and Highway 12 to Blaine Lake via Martensville concurrency. Martensville is located about from the Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport. Martensville and Warman are the only Saskatchewan cities without a full hospital; the closest hospital for both cities is Saskatoon City Hospital. In 2011, the intersection of Centennial Drive and Main Street received the first traffic signals in Martensville's history. Five years later, the city installed traffic signals at Centennial Drive and 3rd Street North. In June 2018, as part of the Martensville overpass project, a new exit ramp added saw the installation of traffic signals at Centennial Drive and 4th Street South. Media From 2007 to present Martensville is serviced by a weekly local newspaper, The Martensville Messenger. Martensville shares other print, radio and television media with its larger neighbour, Saskatoon. Martensville is currently one of only two cities in Saskatchewan without a local radio station, the other being Warman.

Drawn in 1718 by Guillaume Delisle Los Adaes was the capital of Tejas on the northeastern frontier of New Spain from 1729 to 1770. It included a mission, San Miguel de Cuellar de los Adaes, and a presidio, Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de Los Adaes (Our Lady of the Pillar of the Adaes). The name Adaes represents the indigenous Adai people, who were to be served by the mission. The site, now preserved in the state-run Los Adaes State Historic Site, is located on Louisiana Highway 485 in present-day Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. History Although Spain claimed much of the Gulf Coast of North America as part of its colonial territory, it largely ignored the region to the east of the Rio Grande throughout the 17th century.Chipman (1992), p. 26. In 1699, French forts were established at Biloxi Bay and on the Mississippi River, ending Spain's exclusive control of the Gulf Coast.Weber (1992), p. 158. The Spanish recognized that French encroachment could threaten other Spanish areas, and they ordered the reoccupation of Texas as a buffer between New Spain and French settlements in Louisiana.Weber (1992), p. 60. On April 12, 1716, an expedition led by Domingo Ram√≥n left San Juan Bautista for Tejas, intending to establish four missions and a presidio.Chipman (1992), p. 111.Chipman (1992), p. 112. At the same time, the French were building a fort in Natchitoches, having founded the town in 1714. The Spanish countered by founding two more missions just west of Natchitoches, including San Miguel de los Adaes (for a total of six missions in the region).Weber (1992), p. 162. The latter two missions were located in a disputed area; France claimed the Sabine River to be the western boundary of colonial Louisiana, while Spain claimed the Red River was the eastern boundary of colonial Texas, leaving an overlap of .Edmondson (2000), p. 10. In 1719, European powers embarked on the War of the Quadruple Alliance. In June 1719, 7 Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of the mission of San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not know that the nations were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming; the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.Weber (1992), p. 166-7. The Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo volunteered to reconquer Spanish Texas and raised an army of 500 soldiers.Weber (1992), p. 167. By July 1721 Aguayo reached the Neches River. His expedition encountered a French force en route to attack San Antonio de Bexar. The outnumbered Frenchmen agreed to retreat to Louisiana. Aguayo then ordered the building of a new presidio Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de Los Adaes, located near present-day Robeline, Louisiana, only 12 miles (19 km) from Natchitoches. The new fort became the first capital of Texas, and it was guarded by 6 cannon and a garrison of 100 soldiers. All six of the eastern Tejas missions were reopened, under the protection of the new presidio.Chipman (1992), p. 123. Spain discouraged manufacturing in its colonies and limited trade to Spanish goods handled by Spanish merchants and carried on Spanish vessels. Most of the ports, including all of those in Texas, were closed to commercial vessels in the hopes of dissuading smugglers. By law, all goods bound for Texas had to be shipped to Vera Cruz and then transported over the mountains to Mexico City before being sent to Texas. This caused the goods to be very expensive in the Texas settlements.Weber (1992), p. 175. Because of the great distance between Los Adaes and the rest of the populated portions of Texas, the settlers in the area turned most often to the French colonists in neighboring Natchitoches, Louisiana, for trade. Without many goods to trade, however, the Spanish missionaries and colonists had little to offer the Indians, who remained loyal to the French traders.Weber (1992), p. 173. Although the Spanish settlers in the area did not encounter hostile Native Americans, since the local Caddoan- speaking peoples were friendly, the Franciscan missionaries were unsuccessful in converting the local people to Catholicism. After many years of frustration in this regard, in 1768 the College of Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe de Zacatecas, which was the sponsor of the missionaries at Los Adaes, recalled their missionaries, and the mission was closed. On November 3, 1762, as part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded the portion of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain.Weber (1992), p. 198. With France no longer a threat to Spain's North American interests, the Spanish monarchy commissioned the Marquis de Rubi to inspect all of the presidios on the northern frontier of New Spain and make recommendations for the future.Chipman (1992), p. 173. Rubi recommended that eastern Texas be totally abandoned, with all the population moving to San Antonio.Chipman (1992), p. 181. With Louisiana in Spanish control, there was no need for Los Adaes to reside so closely to Natchitoches, especially after the missions had relocated to San Antonio. In August 1768, the acting governor, Juan Mar√≠a Vicencio, Baron de Ripperd√°, moved his headquarters and the garrison to San Antonio, and in 1772 San Antonio became the new capital of Tejas.Weber (1992), p. 211. The settlers who had lived near Los Adaes were forced to resettle in San Antonio, in 1773. In the six years between the inspection and the removal of the settlers, the population of eastern Tejas had increased from 200 settlers of European descent to 500 people, a mixture of Spanish, French, Indians, and a few blacks. The settlers were given only five days to prepare for the move to San Antonio. Many of them perished during the three-month trek and others died soon after arriving.Chipman (1992), p. 186. After vociferously protesting, the former residents of eastern Tejas were allowed to leave San Antonio the following year (1774); but they were not allowed to locate beyond the Trinity River, 175 miles (282 km) from Natchitoches.Weber (1992), p. 222. In 1779, the Comanches began raiding the new settlement. The former Los Adaes settlers chose to move farther east to the old mission of Nacogdoches, where they founded the town of the same name. The new town quickly became a waystation for contraband. The site of Los Adaes was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. Present day Reenactors performing a gun salute at the present day historic site Today the site of Los Adaes is the Los Adaes State Historic Site near the town of Robeline, Louisiana. The Los Adaes site has proven to be one of the most important archaeological sites in the US for the study of colonial Spanish culture. Dr. Hiram F. \\"Pete\\" Gregory Jr., an archaeologist at nearby Northwestern State University, conducted landmark excavations at the historic presidio from the 1960s through the 1980s. In the 1990s, the state appointed Dr. George Avery to the newly created position of station archaeologist of the Los Adaes State Commemorative Area (as it was called at the time). In this capacity, Avery contributed a great deal in his own right. Los Adaes has since lost its station archaeologist position. However, Avery, Gregory, and other archaeologists specializing in the Spanish colonial borderlands continue to advance the knowledge of this frontier outpost. Gregory, in particular, has championed the need for more academic interest in Los Adaes and the colonial history of northern and central Louisiana in general.

Such an exhibition is often referred to simply as a \\"simul\\". Procedure In a regular simul, no chess clocks are used (if they are involved it is called a clock simul). The boards are usually arranged in a large circle or square and the exhibitor walks from board to board in a fixed order. Each individual participant is expected to make a move when the exhibitor arrives at his/her board. The exhibitor may pause briefly before playing his/her move, but will typically attempt to avoid lengthy pauses because too many such pauses will cause the exhibition to continue for an extended period. Longer exhibitions increase the risk of fatigue-induced blunders on the part of the exhibitor, especially since the individual participants remaining at the end tend to be the stronger players who represent the exhibitor's most challenging opponents. As games are finished off, they are usually not replaced and only a few games will remain in progress at the end of the exhibition. At this point clocks are sometimes introduced with each side getting a fixed amount of time. In most regular simuls, the exhibitor plays White in all the games and the individual participants are of varying playing strengths (though they are typically below master class). In clock simuls all the games are played as normal tournament games and are timed by a chess clock. These simuls require the exhibitor to accept a substantial time handicap since his/her clock continues to run on all boards. These simuls typically involve a relatively small number of individual participants whose playing strength is at or near master class. Occasionally, grandmasters have given blindfold simultaneous displays. In such displays, the exhibitor does not look at any of the boards, but retains all the moves of the games in his/her head. The opponents utilize boards and pieces in the standard fashion, but their moves are communicated verbally to the exhibitor by an arbiter or intermediary. Donner's advice Dutch Grandmaster Jan Hein Donner offered the following advice to a player taking a board at a simultaneous exhibition:J. H.

Ka1 Qxa3#  Internet-based simultaneous exhibitions  The internet has allowed for the creation of chess game services wherein people may play an opponent from anywhere in the world. Popular sites such as Lichess may have many thousands of active online games as well as tens of thousands of viewers during any time of day around the world. This new online chess paradigm allows for world class players to be actively playing chess as well as teaching and giving demonstrations. On 13 April 2019, a simultaneous exhibition was hosted by Lichess for International Master Marc Esserman who engaged 100 players. He rapidly moved through a hundred Kings Pawn E4 opening and the matches lasted anywhere from thirty minutes to a full eight hours. Many top level players were involved and the exhibition lasted for just over eight hours. IM Marc Esserman won 82 of the games played with 11 ending in a draw.  Tandem simul  A less popular variation of simultaneous exhibition is the tandem simultaneous exhibition, also known as leapfrog simultaneous exhibition, where more than one (usually two) experts play a number of opponents, making successive moves without consulting one another.

It is set in the early 1980s at the time of the Solidarity protests in Poland. It stars Jeremy Irons as Nowak, a Polish builder leading a team working illegally in London. Plot Arriving in London from Warsaw in December 1981 are master electrician Nowak, who understands the language but not the inhabitants, with three workmen who know no English. Their task is to gut and renovate a house, for which they have brought what tools they can carry, while Nowak has cash to buy materials. Since the whole operation is illegal, Nowak keeps them working indoors while he goes out to get food and supplies. As his money runs out, he takes to stealing so that the four can survive. In the meantime, Poland is undergoing the traumas of demonstrations and strikes followed by the declaration of martial law, banning of Solidarity and mass arrests. All this Nowak conceals from the men, in order to finish the job. With no money left, they have a six-hour walk to the airport and a flight home to an uncertain future. Cast Reception It was entered into the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the award for Best Screenplay. Roger Ebert gave it four stars out of fourMoonlighting at rogerebert.suntimes.com and included it in his list of Best Movies of 1982. Gene Siskel called it his favorite movie of 1982.

The procedure for conflict cases #The court must first decide whether it has the jurisdiction to hear the case (which will involve addressing the question of whether the plaintiff is attempting to manipulate the judicial system by forum shopping). #Characterisation. The court must analyse the case as pleaded and allocate each component to its appropriate legal classification, each of which will have one or more choice of law rules attached to it. #The court will then apply the choice of law rules. In a limited number of cases, usually involving Family Law issues, an incidental question may arise which will complicate this process. Discussion To limit the damage that would result from forum shopping, it is desirable that the same law be applied to achieve the same result no matter where the case is litigated. The system of renvoi is an attempt to achieve that end. If a forum court is directed to consult a foreign law, the first question it must address is whether this is a reference solely to the relevant substantive provisions, or to the state's system of law as a whole which would include its choice of law rules. Forums that do not have renvoi provisions refer only to the specific provisions of relevant law. In this way, the same outcome is achieved no matter where the case is litigated so long as the second state would also have applied its own laws. But if that second country actually has choice of law rules requiring it to apply the forum law, a difference in outcome might arise depending on where the plaintiff invokes jurisdiction. Whether a difference actually emerges depends on whether the other state operates a Single Renvoi system. A single renvoi forum always refers to the other law's choice of law rules. If those rules would send the issue back to the forum court, the forum court will accept the first remission and applies its own laws. Thus, equality of outcome is always achieved so long as the competing laws operate different systems. Some early French authorities support this approach (e.g. Forgo's Case (1882) and Souli√©'s Case (1910)). Similarly, Article 27 of the Introductory Law of the German Civil Code (1900) adopts it. But if both sets of laws operate with either no renvoi system or single renvoi systems, forum shopping will be a potential problem. Hence, there is another system called Double Renvoi or the Foreign Courts Doctrine which will also ensure parity of result so long as no other relevant law is using it. In this scenario, the forum court considers that it is sitting as the foreign court and will decide the matter as the foreign court would. In this system, there can never be more than two remissions, e.g. English forum refers to French law (a single renvoi system) so English law is applied (1st remission) and France accepts the remission (2nd and final). At present, only English law uses this approach. Application of renvoi Because the doctrine is considered difficult and its results are sometimes unpredictable, its application has generally been limited to: *the validity of wills and intestate succession (the validity of transfers of real property); and *retrospective legitimation by the marriage of the natural parents (validity of divorce decrees). However, there are indications in some states that it might also apply to two issues in family law, namely the capacity to marry and the formal validity of marriage. =EU= In the European Union, application of renvoi is expressly excluded in contract cases under article 20 of the Rome I Regulation (regulation (EC) 593/2008l formerly in Article 15 EC Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations, Rome 1980). It has also been rejected for contracts by most Commonwealth countries.see Amin Rasheed Shipping Corporation v. Kuwait Insurance Co [1984] 1 A.C. 50 (H.L.) Most states also exclude it in tort cases e.g. in the UK section 9(5) of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995. Since 11 January 2009, Regulation (EC) 864/2007 (the Rome II Regulation) on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations has been in force, controlling in a uniform way the rules throughout the European Union. Article 24 of this regulation provides: \\"The application of the law of any country specified by this Regulation means the application of the rules of law in force in that country other than its rules of private international law.\\" hence excluding the possibility of renvoi throughout the EU in tort cases. =Australia= In Australia, the doctrine of renvoi was revived by the decision of the High Court in Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd [2005] HCA 54 (29 September 2005). In this decision the High Court considered the situation of Mrs Neilson, who had injured herself falling down the stairs in her apartment in Wuhan, China. Her apartment had been provided by her husband's employer, Overseas Projects Corporation, and Mrs Neilson sued her husband's employer in negligence in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in June 1997, six years after the accident had occurred. Under Australian choice of law rules, the law of the place of the incident or lex loci delicti governs tort situations (following the decision of that court in 2002: Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang). This meant that the law relevant to the resolution of the dispute was that of the People's Republic of China. However under Chinese law, the claim would have been statute barred for exceeding the limitations period (Article 136 of the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China). However Mrs Neilson raised Article 146 of the General Principles in her defence, arguing that the provision of that article should apply making the relevant law for the dispute Australian law. Article 146 provided that: \\"With regard to compensation for damages resulting from an infringement of rights, the law of the place in which the infringement occurred shall be applied. If both parties are nationals of the same country or domiciled in the same country, the law of their own country or of their place of domicile may also be applied\\" As a consequence, the Supreme Court trial judge concluded that Art 146 \\"gives me a right to choose to apply the law of Australia because both parties are nationals of Australia.\\" This decision was reversed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia. On appeal to the High Court, Neilson succeeded. In six separate judgments, the majority of the High Court found in favour of Neilson on the basis that the Australian choice of law rule referred to the whole of the law of the place of the wrong. Secondly, that this meant that the applicable law was referred back to Australia and the Australian limitations statute applied, meaning that Neilson's claim was no longer statute barred. This decision has received strident criticism by Martin Davies,Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Limited: Renvoi and Presumptions about Foreign Law (2006) 30(1) Melbourne University Law Review 244 and both the High Court and Full Court decisions have received very close attention by leading contemporary conflicts scholars including Andrew Lu and Lee Carroll,Ignored No More: Renvoi and International Torts Litigated in Australia (2005) 1(1) Journal of Private International Law 35 Elizabeth Crawford,The Uses of Putativity and Negativity in the conflict of laws (2005) 54 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 829 and Mary Keyes.The Doctrine of Renvoi in International Torts: Mercantile Mutual Insurance v Neilson (2005) 13 Torts Law Journal 1 It has been suggested that this messy interpretation of the Australian Court could have been avoided, had the Court followed the general practice that procedural rules always go with the forum and substantive law depends on the \\"forum most interested\\" analysis. However, since John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson (2000) 203 CLR 503, statutes of limitations are considered substantive law. Because of this, the applicability of limitation laws no longer go with the local forum; rather, they too follow the lex loci delicti. =US= In the United States most courts try to solve conflict of laws questions without invoking renvoi. In Re Schneider's Estate, 96 N.Y.S.2d 652 (1950), is an example where renvoi is recognized as an option, in which the local court chose to apply the foreign country's laws to decide the dispute in the local court. This is most likely to happen in cases involving immovable property or domestic relationships. The main difficulties There are three main difficulties in cases where renvoi may be an issue: #It gives undue weight to the evidence of the experts on foreign laws. #The reference to the conflicts system used in other laws may reveal differences that would have arisen in characterisation or in the choice of law rules to be applied. If these differences would lead to onward transmissions, the forum court will follow the references into third (or further) legal systems. This is unpopular because it requires the parties and the court to consider evidence of multiple legal systems. #There may be an \\"inextricable circle\\" between sets of laws using either single or double renvoi systems which do not have adequate safeguards built in to guarantee when to stop accepting remissions.

There are many Xhosa clans, each with their own styles of drumming and dialects. Xhosa music is characteristically expressive and communicative which includes rhythmical expression of words and sounds. It also includes physical movement employed when clapping, dancing or playing a musical instrument. Different Xhosa chiefdoms share similar musical concepts.D. Dargie.

In order to share in the rites and ceremonies, it is necessary to learn the songs. The learning of music happens through observation, attention, developing music memory, practicing and learning rhythms from others.D. Dargie. International Library of African Music.

African Music, Vol 7, No 3 (1996) pp 30-43. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30250058 Accessed 9 July 2018 Khoisan influence Xhosa people often use their voices to mimic nature's sound. Among Xhosa people, overtone singing is known as 'unngqokolo' which is a word derived from the Khoisan language. Khoisan language and culture has strong influence over Xhosa music as many Khoisan music techniques and songs were assimilated into Xhosa music. Therefore, many Xhosa musical terms have Khoisan roots. Xhosa sound Xhosa overtone singing is based on Xhosa bow instruments such as the 'umrhube' and 'uhadi' which are the two fundamental sounds in Xhosa music. Xhosa traditional musicians imitate the sounds of their musical bows using their voices through the maneuvering of their tongues and shaping of the mouth cavity. They produce overtones by raising the tongue therefore creating a resonance chamber. The characteristic sound of overtone singing is created by tightening the throat muscles to create a low, gutted, rasping sound. This techniques gives particularly women, a deeper voice. Overtone singing is only practised by women and it is generally the overtone singer who leads the song. Diviners often use overtone singing as they believe that it enables them to speak to the ancestors.ref>D. Dargie. International Library of African Music.

It is traditionally played during boys' initiation ceremonies and is accompanied by a special dance performed by the boys. The beating of the ikawu is also accompanied by battle cries. *ingqongqo: This rudimentary drum is made from a stiff dried ox hide and beaten with sticks. The ingqongqo is based upon the hunting shield and the drumsticks of the assegai. A bulls skin is cured and tied on a number of posts three to four feet from the ground. The instrument is played by a group of women with the sticks (amaqoqa). The skin is alternatively placed on the ground, the women sit on it and beat it with the sticks. This drum is no longer found among the Xhosa but, in the past, it was widely used by women during male circumcision ceremonies and diviners ceremonies. The drum has been replaced by modern substitutes such as pieces of cardboard or zinc which is beaten with sticks.Laurie Levine. The Drumcaf√©'s Traditional Music of South Africa. Jacana Media, 2005.

Frame drums are also popular in many regions of Georgia, like Kartli, Kakheti, Tusheti, Samegrelo, Racha, and Imereti. This is a single headed percussion instrument which is not only found in Northern South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East, but also in parts of the Russian polar regions. The simple drum is formed by attaching a skin cover onto a wooden ring with glue and cloth ties. This is similar to the Persian daira and the Turkish def. Some daira have metal pieces attached to give them a tambourine- like quality. History The history of dayereh goes back to many centuries. An engraved bronze cup from LorestƒÅn at the National Museum of Iran in Tehran, portrays a double ney (end-blown reed pipes), chang (harp), and dayereh in a shrine or court processional, as similarly documented in Egypt, Elam, and the Persian province of Babylonia where music was arranged for performance by large orchestral ensembles.in Ghaval by Dzhabbar Kariagdiev In the Pahlavi (Persian pre-Islamic language) the name is dareh. The poet Abu Saeed Abolkheir (967‚Äì1048) mentioned in his works, the word dayereh as a drum. Regional variations The dayereh is one of the most famous frame drums in Persia and Central Asia, and in the Pahlavi (Persian ancient language) the dayereh is called dareh. In Azerbaijan and Armenia, it is called ghaval and sometimes daf/dap, and is played on festive occasions. In Azerbaijani art music, the drum that usually accompanies the Ashigh (poet/singer) is ghaval (dayereh). A traditional ensemble contains a singer, who plays this drum, and two instrumentalists, one playing the tar (long-necked lute) and the other, the kamancheh (bowed spike fiddle). Structure and construction The jingles which are thin metal plates or rings, are attached to hooks in three or four rectangular holes in the circular wooden frame. The drumhead is made of goat skin. The width of the frame is 45‚Äì50 cm (18‚Äì20 in.) and the depth, 5‚Äì7 cm (2‚Äì3 in.). In order to bend the frame, the wood (\\"buka\\", \\"orev\\") may be softened in water before being bent around a hot metal cylinder. The frame is closed by gluing the ends together. Finally, the skin is attached to the frame by fixing it with another wooden frame or by using nails. Another variation is to have the ring-style jingles arranged around the edge of the inside of the drum the whole way aroundGhaval image. or to have several tiers half way around the inside edge. Performance The sound is produced by hitting the membrane with either hand ‚Äì the left hand, which also holds the dayereh, strikes the edges, and the right hand strikes the center. The right-hand fingers are fastened about their neighbours and suddenly released (like the action of finger-snapping) to produce loud, rapid, sharp sounds. The dayereh is a solo instrument. Most often it is supported by \\"Gajda\\", \\"chalgija\\", or \\"tarabuka\\". Marko Cepenkov mentions the dayereh as a companion of the \\"Gajda\\" in the 18th and 19th centuries.Dayereh It is most often used for keeping the rhythm in Macedonian folk songs and dances, and also in traditional Macedonian rituals, like wedding ceremony.

In 1821 the Rootstown Post Office was established. It continues today under the ZIP Code Rootstown, OH 44272 and serves much of the township. In 1832, many German immigrants came who were farmers, stonemasons and carpenters. A plague in 1845 took 49 victims, including the town's only physician, Dr. Andrew Basset. In 1850 a band of 16 whaling sea captains from Nantucket bought land, built large homes and became farmers. Nelson Converse opened the first general store in 1853 in the center of town. In 1866 the Central and Pacific Railroad was built through the northeastern part of the township. Electricity brought modern conveniences to the area in 1921, and street lights to both Rootstown and New Milford in 1949. 27 men formed the volunteer fire company in 1938. Its equipment was housed in the basement of the town hall until a new building was constructed by volunteer work and community fundraiser carnivals in 1955-1956. The department constructed a new building in 2002 adjacent to the former at the intersection of Tallmadge Road and SR 44. It opened during the bicentennial weekend; the previous fire station was razed. The first religious body established in Rootstown was the Rootstown Congregational Church in 1810 and they were followed by the Methodist Church in 1815. St. Peter of the Fields Catholic Church was established in 1868 and Grace Church of Rootstown (formerly New Milford Baptist) in 1948. In 1961, a Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that serves southern Portage County was relocated to Rootstown. Government The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer,¬ß503.24, ¬ß505.01, and ¬ß507.01 of the Ohio Revised Code. Accessed 4/30/2009. who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees. =Town hall= The Rootstown Town Hall was built in 1809 and remains in use today. It first received electricity in 1921 and indoor plumbing in 1963. In 1999 the township zoning board began using the basement of the town hall to store accumulated files and records. Today, it is located along SR 44 just south of the town center. Public services =Transportation= In Rootstown Township, Interstate 76 passes through many wooded hills Several highways pass through Rootstown Township‚ÄîSR 5, SR 44, and I-76. Public transportation is provided by the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA), which provides routes to Kent, Ravenna, and other parts of Portage County. =Education= Rootstown Township is served by the Rootstown Local School District, which includes an elementary school serving grades K‚Äì5, a middle school for grades 6‚Äì8, and a 9th‚Äì12th grade high school. All three schools continue to be rated \\"Excellent\\" according to state \\"Report Cards\\" and continue to provide excellent educational standards to township families. All three schools are located on a central campus on State Route 44 just north of the town center. Across the street from the Rootstown Schools campus is the campus of Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED). The NEOMED campus is also home to the Bio- Med Science Academy, a grades 9-12 STEM+M (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Medicine) academy.Bio-Med Science Academy =Cemeteries= There are three cemeteries in Rootstown Township: the Old Cemetery, St. Peter of the Fields Cemetery, and Homeland Cemetery. Old Cemetery The first death in Rootstown Township was on August 31, 1808, with the death of 51-year-old Nathan Chapman, Sr. This cemetery was used until 1897 when a fire destroyed the township records. The last known burial at the Old Cemetery was in 1999. St. Peter of the Fields Cemetery *Established in 1867 with the first burial, this cemetery was dedicated holy ground for the Catholics of the parish of St. Peter of the Fields Church. *The Old Section started in 1867, the Sacred Heart in 1941, and the Holy Angels, the newest section named in 2002, made up the resting grounds. A shrine and altar were built in 1941 and were re-built larger in 2001 to accommodate mass celebration there. *A new church was established in 2006. Homeland Cemetery *Land was purchased and cleared for the new cemetery around 1890. *The shrubs along the front were planted in 1950. *In 2001-2002 Rootstown Township developed more land into burial plots and put the cemetery records on computer discs.

Ektachrome has a distinctive look that became familiar to many readers of National Geographic, which used it extensively for color photographs for decades in settings where Kodachrome was too slow. In terms of reciprocity characteristics Ektachrome is stable at shutter speeds between ten seconds and 1/10,000 of a second. Kodak Ektachrome F 35mm Slide Film, E-2 Process, Expired: February 1963 Kodak High Speed Ektachrome 35mm Film (Expired: 1970s) Kodak Ektachrome 100 35mm Slide Film Kodak Ektachrome 100 35mm Color Reversal Film, 2018. A view of the Skylab space station taken with a hand-held 70 mm Hasselblad camera using a 100 mm lens and SO-368 medium speed Ektachrome film Ektachrome, initially developed in the early 1940s, allowed professionals and amateurs alike to process their own films. It also made color reversal film more practical in larger formats, and the Kodachrome Professional film in sheet sizes was later discontinued. Whereas the development process used by Kodachrome is technically intricate and beyond the means of amateur photographers and smaller photographic labs, Ektachrome processing is simpler, and small professional labs could afford equipment to develop the film. Many process variants (designated E-1 through E-6) were used to develop it over the years. Modern Ektachrome films are developed using the E-6 process, which can be carried out by small labs or by a keen amateur using a basic film tank and tempering bath to maintain the temperature at 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C). Ektachrome has been used occasionally as a motion picture film stock, such as in the 1999 film Three Kings and the 2006 film Inside Man, in which each used cross processing in C-41 color negative chemistry to give a unique appearance. Several years before Ektachrome's discontinuation, some of Kodak's consumer E-6 films were rebranded as Elite Chrome. In late 2009, Kodak announced the discontinuation of Ektachrome 64T (EPY) and Ektachrome 100 Plus (EPP) films, citing declining sales. On February 4, 2011, Kodak announced the discontinuance of Ektachrome 200 on its website. On March 1, 2012, Kodak announced the discontinuance of three color Ektachrome films. In December 2012 Kodak announced its discontinuance of Ektachrome 100D color reversal movie film in certain formats. By late 2013, all Ektachrome products were discontinued. On September 25, 2018, Kodak announced that the 35 mm format of Ektachrome was again available, while Super 8 and 16 mm motion picture versions would be available later. Processing Although Kodachrome is often considered a superior film due to its archival qualities and color palette, advances in dye and coupler technology blurred the boundaries between the differing processes, along with Kodak having abandoned Kodachrome research and development since the mid-1990s. Furthermore, the developing of Kodachrome always required a complex, fickle process requiring an on-site analytical lab and typically required a turnaround of several days to allow for shipping times. By contrast, small professional labs have been able to process Ektachrome on-site since the 1950s, with product safety and effluent discharge having been drastically improved since the 1970s, when Kodak reformulated their entire color chemistry lineup. It is even possible for amateur labs to process Ektachrome within an hour using a rotary tube processor (made by Jobo, WingLynch or PhotoTherm), sink-line, or even by hand inversion in a small drum and E-2, E-4, and E-6 processing chemistry kits were sold for home darkrooms. Variants * Before Process AR-5 there was EA-5 for aero film. This is a hot version of E-4 and similar to ME-4 for Ektachrome motion picture film. * E-6 was made available to the public in 1975, but only the pro films were available at the time. There were some color stability (\\"keeping\\") issues to verify before the amateur films could be released. * E-7 is the \\"mix-it- yourself\\" version of E-6. Functionally it was equivalent, but there were a few differences. * ES-8 is a special process for one type of Super 8mm movie film. It was introduced in 1975. There were some other Ektachrome processes for 16 mm motion picture films: * ME-2A * ECO-2 * EC0-3 * E-89 * E-99 * VNF-1 (\\"Video News Film\\", as this film was originally introduced for 16mm news gathering) * RVNP * CRI-1 The following processes are used for amateur Ektachrome super 8 mm movie film: * Ektachrome Movie process introduced in 1971 (movies without movie lights). The process was later designated EM-24 * EM-25 is the mix-it- yourself version of EM-24. * EM-26 is the updated process for improved Ektachrome super 8 films introduced in 1981. * EM-27 is the mix-it-yourself version of EM-26.

The conditioner, bleach and stabilizer baths were modified in the mid-1990s to remove the formaldehyde from the stabilizer: This change was indicated by changing the names of the conditioner step to pre-bleach step, and the stabilizer step to the final rinse step; E-6P: Used for push processing of Kodak Ektachrome films in general, and particularly for Kodak Ektachrome EPH ISO 1600 film, which has a speed of ISO 400 in normal E6, but is exposed at EI 1600 and push processed two stops in the first developer bath (10:00 @100.0F) to achieve the ISO 1600 speed rating. (It is natural for a faster film to require a longer first development time. This is sacrificed in the case of most color processing for consistency in processing, especially in machine processing.) Other film manufacturers use their own designations for nearly identical processes. They include Fujifilm's process CR-55 (E-4) and CR-56 (cross-licensed with Kodak's process E-6; but with slight variations in the first developer); and the now-discontinued Agfachrome and Konica's CRK-2 (E-6 equivalent). High Speed Ektachrome, announced in 1959The New York Times: \\"Color Film Rated at 160 Announced by Kodak\\", March 29, 1959. provided an ASA 160 color film, which was much faster than Kodachrome. In 1968, Kodak started offering push processing of this film, allowing it to be used at ASA 400.The New York Times: \\"Photo Trade Show Opens\\", February 25, 1968. The E-4 process was generally stopped after 1977, although continued in use for Kodak PCF (Photomicrography Color Film) until the 1980s, and for Kodak IE (Color Infra- red film) until 1996. This was due to a legal commitment by Kodak to provide the process for 30 years. The Ektachrome process differs significantly from the Agfa Process AP-41, used generally until 1983 to develop films such as Agfachrome CT18 and 50s Professional. Processing laboratories The Washington (W) Processing Lab operated between 1967 and July 1999. The lab facility was located in Montgomery County at the address of 1 Choke Cherry Road, Rockville, Maryland. The Palo Alto (P) California Processing Lab was located at 925 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California. The Rochester (R) New York Processing Lab was located at Kodak Park in Rochester, New York. There were also Kodak processing laboratories in other locations, including Chicago, (Illinois), Hollywood, (California-H), Atlanta (Georgia), Findlay (Ohio), Toronto (Canada) and Hemel Hempstead (England). Return of Ektachrome On January 5, 2017, Kodak Alaris announced that Ektachrome would return in both ISO 100 35mm still frame and Super 8 motion picture formats, before the end of the year. However, the release date was later pushed to 2018 after it was discovered certain materials used in its manufacture were now unavailable, requiring a reformulation. Kodak will manufacture the film and market the Super 8 version. Kodak Alaris will market the 35mm still version. The Super-8 version was exhibited at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, and was named Ektachrome 100D 7294. In fall 2018, Kodak released the newly-formulated Ektachrome with 35mm format being the first to arrive on September 25 and in Super 8 format on October 1. On June 1st 2019, Kodak Alaris announced a wide coating trial of Ektachrome in 120 format for the end of July. Previously, in January 2019, a Kodak Alaris representative indicated work was progressing on Ektachrome in both 120 and larger formats. This project reached completion when, on December 10th 2019, Kodak Alaris announced the availability of Ektachrome E100 in a 120-format 5-roll propack and a 4x5 box of 10 sheets.

He played keyboards, sang, and wrote songs with Andrew Latimer. During his career, Bardens worked alongside Rod Stewart, Mick Fleetwood, and Van Morrison. He recorded eleven solo albums. Career Bardens was born in Westminster, London to Dennis Bardens, a novelist and biographer, and grew up in Notting Hill. He studied fine art at Byam Shaw School of Art, and learned the piano, before switching to the Hammond organ after listening to Jimmy Smith. In 1965, he spent a brief spell as the keyboard player with Them after leaving The Cheynes. After leaving Them, he formed a band called The Peter B's, releasing a single, in 1966, called \\"If You Wanna Be Happy\\" (b/w \\"Jodrell Blues\\"), an instrumental version of the old standard. He moved on and formed Peter B's Looners which eventually morphed into Shotgun Express, a band that played soul music and featured Rod Stewart, Peter Green, and Mick Fleetwood. Fleetwood later said Barden's recruitment into the band kick-started his musical career. From August 1968 to February 1970, he formed The Village with featured future Elvis Costello and The Attractions bassist Bruce Thomas and Bill Porter (drums). They released a single \\"Man in the Moon\\"/\\"Long Time Coming\\". In 1970, Bardens recorded The Answer, an album featuring Peter Green and Andy Gee. Bardens recorded an eponymous album in 1971 which was released in the United States as Write My Name in the Dust before forming Camel in 1972. He left Camel in 1978 to join Them bandmate Van Morrison's band. He recorded Wavelength with Morrison and appeared in the line up of the album's promotional tour. By the end of the 1970s, Bardens began exploring electronica and released the album Heart to Heart in 1979. Bardens co-wrote \\"Looking for a Good Time\\" with Bobby Tench, featured as the B-side of the single \\"Chain Gang\\" (1982), which Tench had recorded as a tribute to Sam Cooke. During that era, Bardens also played with the Alan Parsons Project. In 1984, he became a member of Keats (an Alan Parsons Project offshoot) and released an album with them. Bardens continued to release a number of solo electronic albums including Seen One Earth (1987), which found chart success in the United States. The first single from the album, \\"In Dreams\\", was met with commercial success as well. The song enjoyed heavy airplay on rock stations in the U.S. and Australia, where Brisbane rock station 4MMM, the most popular radio station in the country at the time, added it to their playlist. In 1988, he followed this with Speed of Light (1988) which featured Mick Fleetwood. \\"Gold\\" from this album was released in the U.S as a single and found some success on MTV. He released Water Colours in 1991, and Big Sky in 1994. Also in 1994, with his former Camel bandmate Andy Ward and former members of Caravan, he formed the band Mirage for a brief European tour. A subsequent, all-American version of the band, with only Bardens and guitarist Steve Adams from the original line- up, did more touring in 1996. His last concert, subsequent to being diagnosed with a brain tumour, was in Los Angeles in the summer of 2001. Other performers who joined him at his concert included Mick Fleetwood, John Mayall, John McVie, Sheila E. and Ben Harper.

It is situated about 170 km north-west of Adelaide, and 56 km south of Port Pirie. At the , the town of Port Broughton had a population of 1,034. The close proximity to Adelaide (two hours' drive) makes it a popular tourist destination, with the number of people in town swelling to over 4000 in the summer holidays. History Port Broughton Hotel, facing east, in 1914 The land around Port Broughton was initially used for grazing, however the local conditions were unsuitable and the land was divided up into acre lots and sold. Port Broughton was surveyed in 1871 to service the surrounding wheat and barley growers on the recommendation of Captain Henry Dale. It is on a sheltered inlet called Mundoora Arm Inlet at the extreme northern end of Yorke Peninsula. The town is named after the Broughton River (named by Edward John Eyre after William Broughton), the mouth of which is about north of the township.  Transport  The face of the 'T'-shaped jetty at Port Broughton The 10 miles long horse-drawn tramway was opened in 1876 Built in 1876, the 'T'-shaped jetty was serviced by an isolated narrow gauge railway line from Mundoora, 16 km inland and uphill. The Port Broughton railway line, officially opened on 11 March 1876, brought the grain down to the port. Horses were used to tow the empty wagons uphill, but they were sent downhill powered only by gravity, with a driver to operate the brakes. The passenger service ceased on 17 September 1925, but the grain traffic continued. During January, 1926, a Fordson rail tractor displaced the animal power. From 1931, the railways contracted out the service to a private operator. The service ceased altogether on 3 August 1942, but the tractor continued to shunt wheat wagons between the station yard and the jetty until moved elsewhere. Ketches carried the grain from the jetty 8 kilometres out into the gulf where the larger windjammers were anchored to carry the grain back to England. The windjammers ceased to call in 1949. Locomotives were proposed in 1906. = Disappearance of aviator Edward Gage = In June 1943, Edward Gage, an electrical fitter who worked for BHP in Whyalla, was killed after his Tiger Moth plane ran out of fuel and crash landed in Spencer Gulf. He was last seen flying over Port Broughton, en route to Whyalla from Parafield. A coronial inquiry followed but neither his remains nor that of the plane were found. In January 1990, Goolwa man Ron Anchor arranged a search party to find the wreck. Geography Lying on the eastern side of Spencer Gulf, Port Broughton's coastline is relatively protected, resulting in large expanses of shallow water and seagrasses, tidal flats and vast areas of mangroves that flank the inlet on which the town is built. The small town of Fisherman Bay lies 5 km north of Port Broughton and has much the same coastal features. Between the mouth of Fisherman Bay and Port Broughton lies Shag Island, an important breeding site for several species of cormorant. The Broughton River lies further north toward Port Pirie, where its estuary is located. Further inland, most of the land is fairly featureless farming country, with only fragments of the original vegetation remaining. Media Port Broughton was briefly home to a short lived newspaper published by William John George and James Sisely. Originally called Port Broughton Echo (1887), it was printed by the Northern Argus in Clare. It was then renamed to Broughton Echo (1887-1888), but soon ceased publication in July 1888. Economy Since its establishment, Port Broughton's economy has largely been driven agriculture, in particular cereal crops. Commercial fishing is also an important part of the economy, with scalefish and Blue Swimmer Crabs accounting for much of the catch. Port Broughton supports a prawning fleet. Like many towns on the Yorke Peninsula, Port Broughton is a prime tourist destination, with activities such as fishing, crabbing and a variety of watersports being popular. The town has a boat ramp for such activities. The town has two caravan parks and a number of units, as well as a motel. Nearby Fisherman's Bay has many shacks belonging to holiday-makers, as well as its own small boat ramp. Community The recorded population the township of Port Broughton at the time of the 2011 census was 982 (Port Broughton district population 1424). The majority of the population (838) were Australian born, with the majority of immigrants coming from the United Kingdom. The census also found that over half the population of Port Broughton is over 55, with the median age being 61, suggesting the town is popular with retirees. Christianity is the dominant religion in the region, and is well serviced by a number of churches. The town has a number of sporting clubs including Cricket and Netball clubs, and an Australian rules football club playing in the Northern Areas Football Association as the Broughton-Mundoora Eagles.

While SR 9 is mainly used as a state designation for Interstate 95 in Florida from the Golden Glades Interchange in Miami Gardens to the Georgia border (near Yulee, Florida), a signed SR 9, which is locally known in the Miami area as West 27th Avenue, Unity Boulevard, and historically Grapeland Boulevard, extends from the Coconut Grove section of Miami to the Golden Glades Interchange (where the unsigned portion continues northward along I-95). The segment of I-95 south of the Golden Glades Interchange carries the designation of State Road 9A. Route description Southwest 27th Avenue begins locally at Bayshore Drive in the Coconut Grove neighborhood in Miami. The road heads north until it intersects Dixie Highway (US 1). SR 9 begins at this intersection, located between the Coral Way and Coconut Grove neighborhoods. SR 9 then makes its way north, cutting through all three sub-neighborhoods of Coral Way‚ÄîSilver Bluff, Coral Gate, and Shenandoah‚Äîwith a major intersection with Coral Way (SR 972) in the middle of it. After passing through Coral Way, SR 9's next major intersection is with the Tamiami Trail (US 41 / SR 90) before passing through more residential areas. The next major intersection with Flagler Street is located only a block west from the historic Miami Senior High School, as well as a half block east from the Miami-Dade County Auditorium. SR 9 continues north for a mile before its interchange with the Dolphin Expressway (SR 836). Five blocks north of the Dolphin Expressway, SR 9 crosses the Miami River into the Allapattah neighborhood. There are two major intersections in Allapatah: the first is with Northwest 36th Street (US 27 / SR 25), and the second is with the Airport Expressway (SR 112). Afterwards, SR 9 leaves Miami city limits and bisects the CDP of Brownsville. While in Brownsville, Miami's Metrorail splits the street in two, with two lanes running in either direction on both sides of the track. After its intersection with Northwest 79th Street (SR 934), SR 9 enters the CDPs of West Little River and Westview. In Westview, its intersection with Gratigny Road (SR 924) forms the east border and northeast corner of Miami-Dade College's North Campus, and is also a quarter mile west from the former Westview Country Club. As it enters the city of Opa-locka, SR 9 intersects with Northwest 135th Street (SR 916) before turning to the northeast. Here, Northwest 27th Avenue continues northward as State Road 817. The signed portion of SR 9 ends at the Golden Glades Interchange later; however, SR 9 continues northward as a designation of Interstate 95 to the Georgia state line. History The section of SR 9 northeast into the Golden Glades Interchange was planned before the Interstate Highway System as a bypass to US 1\\\\.

Contemporary engraving. The Great Plague of Vienna occurred in 1679 in Vienna, Austria, the imperial residence of the Austrian Habsburg rulers. From contemporary descriptions, the disease is believed to have been bubonic plague, which is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, carried by fleas associated with the black rat and other rodents. The city was crippled by the epidemic, which recurred fitfully into the early 1680s, claiming an estimated 76,000 residents. Vienna, located on the River Danube, was a major trading crossroads between east and west. As a result of this traffic, the city had suffered from episodic plague outbreaks since the first wave of \\"Black Death\\" in the fourteenth century. The city was crowded and densely built. Descriptions indicate that there were no public sewers or drainage systems, with stinking mounds of domestic garbage littering the streets. In addition, warehouses for trade goods, which held items such as clothing, carpets, and grain for months at a time, were heavily infested with rats. Conditions in the city were considered so unhealthy and filthy, even for the time, that the plague often carried the title \\"Viennese death\\" in other parts of Europe. A religious order operating in Vienna, the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity, created special hospitals for both children and adults during the 1679 epidemic. The basic nursing care offered in the hospitals was simple, but was generally a vast improvement over other medical and public health measures in the city. Doctors treated patients by using emetics, bloodletting, and by applying noxious ointments. The corpses of plague victims were carted to the outer edges of the city and placed in large open pits for burning. However, the pits were exposed to the open air for several days until they were nearly full, allowing ongoing infection of the rat population. To commemorate the city's deliverance from the Great Plague and later waves of the disease, the Viennese erected monuments such as the famous Baroque Karlskirche with the associated 69 foot plague columns known as the Pests√§ule. Regional outbreak What has become known as the \\"Great Plague of Vienna\\", was actually only a subset of a much larger outbreak across Germany, Austria, Bohemia, and neighboring regions. This epidemic appears to have been carried into the region from two opposing directions. It had been raging in Western Europe for many years, traveling East by trade routes. The Great Plague of London of 1665‚Äì1666, which is believed to have originated from the Netherlands in the 1650s, killed around 100,000 people, and was the first major epidemic in a series of outbreaks. In 1666 a severe plague raged in Cologne and on the Rhine, which was prolonged until 1670 in the district. In the Netherlands, there was a plague in 1667‚Äì1669, but there are no definite notices of it after 1672. France saw its last plague epidemic in 1668. In the years 1675‚Äì1684 a new plague wave originated in the Ottoman Empire (Turkey and areas of the Balkans). It moved into North Africa, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, Austria and Saxony, progressing generally northward. The island of Malta lost 11,000 people in an epidemic in 1675‚Äì76. The plague of Vienna in 1679 was very severe, causing at least 76,000 deaths. Other urban centers in this area of Europe had similar levels of casualties. For instance, Prague in 1681 lost 83,000 due to plague. Dresden was affected in 1680, Magdeburg and Halle in 1682. In Halle, a mortality of 4,397 out of a population of about 10,000 was recorded. Many North German city populations fell in these years. By 1683, the plague disappeared from Germany until the epidemic of 1707. Lieber Augustin The great plague of 1679 gave rise to the legend of Lieber Augustin (\\"Dear Augustin\\"). Augustin was a popular street musician, who, according to the legend, fell into a pit with bodies of plague victims, late at night when he was drunk. Augustin did not contract the disease, which may have been owed to the influence of the alcohol. Augustin is remembered in the popular folk song Oh du lieber Augustin.

It is trimorphous with alstonite and paralstonite, that is to say the three minerals have the same formula but different structures. Baryte and quartz pseudomorphs after barytocalcite have been observed. Barytocalcite crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, typically as massive to druzy accumulations of transparent white to yellow to grey aggregates of slender prismatic crystals. It has a Mohs hardness of 4 and a specific gravity of 3.64 to 3.71. It was first described in 1824 for an occurrence in the Blagill Mine in North Pennines, Cumbria (Cumberland), England, and named for its composition. Structure The mineral crystallises in the monoclinic crystal system. Most sources put it in the prismatic class 2/m, with space group P21/m, but Webmin puts it in the sphenoidal class 2 with space group P21. The structure is similar to that of dolomite, but with two crystallographically different CO3 groups. The cation layers are stacked in an ABCABC... stacking pattern, repeating every 3 layers. The Ca ion is coordinated to 7 oxygens.  Unit cell  All sources give unit cell parameters whose values rounded down are a = 8.1 √Ö, b = 5.2 √Ö, c = 6.5 √Ö and Œ≤ = 106¬∞, with two formula units per unit cell (Z = 2). The primary source has a = 8.092 √Ö, b = 5.2344 √Ö, c = 6.544 √Ö, Œ≤ = 106.05¬∞ and Z=2.  Appearance  Barytocalcite often forms oriented growths on baryte, and calcite, witherite and baryte can be epitaxial on barytocalcite. Crystals are normally short to long prismatic and striated. They are transparent to translucent, colourless, white, greyish, greenish or yellowish with a white streak and a vitreous to resinous lustre.  Optical properties  Barytocalcite is a biaxial (-) mineral with refractive indices nŒ± = 1.525, nŒ≤ = 1.684 and nŒ≥ = 1.686. The maximum birefringence (the difference in refractive index between light travelling through the crystal with different polarizations) is Œ¥ = 0.161. The optic angle 2V is the angle between the two optic axes in a biaxial crystal. The measured values of 2V for this mineral is 15¬∞. It is also possible to calculate a theoretical value of 2V from the measured values of the refractive indices. The calculated value for barytocalcite is 10¬∞. If the colour of the incident light is changed, then the refractive indices are modified, and the value of 2V changes. This is known as dispersion of the optic axes. For barytocalcite the effect is weak, with 2V larger for red light than for violet light (r>v). The optical directions X, Y and Z are the directions of travel of light with refractive indices nŒ±, nŒ≤ and nŒ≥ respectively. In general they are not the same as the directions a, b and c of the crystallographic axes. For barytocalcite Z is parallel to the b axis, X is at an angle of 64¬∞ to the c axis and Y is at an angle of 26¬∞ to the c axis. Sources disagree about fluorescence. Webmin describes the mineral as non-fluorescent, Dana categorises it as weakly fluorescent and Mindat states that it is fluorescent dull yellow under both longwave and shortwave ultraviolet light.  Physical properties  Barytocalcite has at least one perfect and one imperfect cleavage. It is a brittle mineral, and breaks with an uneven to conchoidal fracture. It is quite soft, with a hardness 4, the same as that of fluorite. Calcite CaCO3 and dolomite CaMg(CO3)2 are carbonates where calcium Ca and magnesium Mg replace the barium in the formula for barytocalcite, BaCa(CO3)2. These two minerals are even softer than barytocalcite, and much less dense. Barytocalcite has specific gravity 3.7. This is higher than that of calcite (2.7) or dolomite (2.85) because the barium atom is very heavy, with atomic mass 137, which is much more than magnesium at 24 and calcium at 40. Barytocalcite is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid HCl and it is not radioactive.  Type locality  The type locality is the Blagill Mine, Nent Valley, Alston Moor District, North Pennines, North and Western Region, Cumbria, England. This mine is no longer operative, and it has been designated a site of Site of Special Scientific Interest so collecting is no longer allowed.

From the perspective of the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist traditions of Dzogchen, the mind is merely vƒÅyu (breath) in the body. Thus working with vƒÅyu and the body is paramount, while meditation, on the other hand, is considered contrived and conceptual. The late Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche (1938-2018), a prominent proponent of trul khor, preferred to use the equivalent Sanskrit term, Yantra Yoga, when writing in English. Trul khor derives from the instructions of the Indian mahasiddhas (great sages) who founded Vajrayana (3rd to 13th centuries CE). Trul khor traditionally consists of 108 movements, including bodily movements (or dynamic asanas), incantations (or mantras), pranayama and visualizations. The flow or vinyƒÅsa of movements are likened to prayer beads. The walls of the Dalai Lama's summer temple of Lukhang depict trul khor asanas. Lung Lung (Tibetan:‡Ω¢‡æ≥‡Ω¥‡ΩÑ; Wylie: rlung) is equivalent to the Sanskrit vƒÅyu. English discourse Namkhai Norbu was the first to discuss Trul Khor in English with his book on Yantra Yoga, essentially a commentary on a practical yoga manual by Vairotsana. Namkhai Norbu began dissemination of Yantra Yoga through his practical teaching and esoteric transmission of this discipline within the International Dzogchen Community which he founded post 1975 from its seat in Italy, Merigar. Chaoul (2006) has begun discussion of Bon traditions of Trul Khor in English with his thesis from Rice University. In his work, Chaoul makes reference to a commentary by the famed Bonpo Dzogchen master, Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen.

English is the country's official language. English was introduced into Malawi towards the end of the 19th century, due to the influence of British explorers, missionaries, the arrival of the African Lakes Corporation, and colonial administrators present since the establishment in the 1890s of the British Central Africa Protectorate. The seventy years of British colonial rule that followed the Scramble for Africa, set the groundwork for English to grow into the area's dominant and most socially prestigious language. Since Malawian independence, the dominance of English has continued: * official government records are written in English, * parliament conducts its deliberations in English, * the laws of Malawi are written in English, * progression into secondary and higher education requires certification of competence in English, * nearly all Malawian newspapers are published in English (though some include small Chichewa supplements), * English remains the language of commerce in the country. This remains true despite a large majority of Malawians speaking Chichewa and the small number of English speakers outside urban centres. Also, in Malawian government schools, students are taught in Chichewa, and learn English as a second language from about age 10. But in international schools in Malawi (like Saint Andrew's International High School in Blantyre) which follow the British curriculum, English is the language students are taught in, and do not learn Chichewa at all, as it is regarded as a local language.

Its mission is to preserve and enhance the international purchasing power of the reserves, with the aim to achieve good long-term returns above global inflation over the investment time horizon of 20 years. With a network of 10 offices in key financial capitals around the world, GIC invests internationally in developed market equities, emerging market equities, nominal bonds and cash, inflation- linked bonds, private equity and real estate.Retrieved 21 March 2018. The Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute (SWFI) had estimated the fund's assets at US$440 billion. In addition to GIC, the Government of Singapore owns another sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings, which manages about SGD$308 billion of assets.Retrieved 21 March 2018. History In 1981, Goh Keng Swee, then first Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), saw the trend of Singapore's rapidly growing foreign reserves and decided to invest Singapore's reserves for the future of the nation and the welfare of its people. He was advised by the British merchant bank, N M Rothschild & Sons, and established the GIC. The government then embarked on a change in investment policy by investing the bulk of its foreign reserves in longer-term, high-yielding assets rather than in liquid but low-yielding assets. An undisclosed number of those who left the MAS in 1981 went to work for the new GIC. In the late 1990s, four of its most senior positions were held by former Monetary Authority of Singapore officers. Investments GIC has the ability to invest across a full spectrum of financial assets, from sovereign debt to infrastructure, and manages approximately 80 per cent of its portfolio in-house.\\"Sovereign Wealth Funds Look for Inside Edge by Managing Money In-House.\\" Institutional Investor. 24 September 2013. Retrieved 27 September 2013. Traditionally, GIC has kept a low profile in its investments.Financial Times During the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, however, a number of its investments attracted controversy. In 2013, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the GIC was one of the most active SWF investors for the year. In 2006, at the height of the US real estate bubble, it made a US$200 million investment in the equity of Stuyvesant Town‚ÄîPeter Cooper Village, the largest apartment complex in Manhattan (as well as US$575 million in secondary loans). The management of the complex, Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty, defaulted on their loan in 2010, effectively wiping out the investment. In late 2007, during the first phase of the crisis, GIC invested $11 billion Swiss francs for a 7.9% stake in the Swiss bank UBS. The loans were converted into equity in 2010, with an estimated 70% loss of value, though partially offset by a 9% fixed coupon. GIC had acknowledged that the timing for the investment could have been better. It also stated that other investments made at that time have had positive returns which offset the losses on UBS. GIC's total portfolio has fully recovered to its value prior to the global financial crisis. In 2008, GIC invested US$6.88 billion for a 9% stake in Citigroup. In 2009, it pared its stake to less than 5%, realising a $1.6 billion profit, with another $1.6 billion paper profit on its remaining holding. On 30 July 2013, Singapore's GIC was part of a consortium to acquire Transport et Infrastructures Gaz France (TIGF) which is Total's gas transportation and storage business for an enterprise value of ‚Ç¨2.4 billion (US$3.25 billion). The consortium includes Snam (45%) an Italian gas storage and transport operator, Singapore's GIC (35%) and EDF (20%).\\"GIC Private Limited Part of Consortium that Acquires Total‚Äôs Gas Transport and Storage Unit.\\" Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. 16 August 2013. Retrieved 21 August 2013. As of 2017, GIC holds around 34% of its portfolio in the US; 3% in Latin America; 6% in the rest of Americas; 6% in the United Kingdom; 12% in the Eurozone; 6% in the Middle East, Africa and the rest of Europe; 19% in Asia excluding Japan; 12% in Japan and 2% in Australasia. In 2017 it was reported that GIC would purchase a 10% stake in British specialist bank OakNorth for 90 million pounds. Performance In 2008, GIC published for the first time a report containing information on its 20-year returns and more information on how it is managed and governed, and how it invests Singapore's foreign reserves. GIC does not disclose the amount of funds it manages and its annual profit and loss. Revealing the exact amount would expose the full size of Singapore's financial reserves and make it easier for speculators to attack the Singapore dollar during periods of vulnerability. Since 2011, GIC had also published the 5-year and 10-year nominal rates of return to provide a sense of the ongoing medium-term investment performance, even while GIC maintains its sights on the long term. It included two composite portfolios and volatility statistics to reflect the level of portfolio risk and to offer perspective in reading the 5-year and 10-year figures. For the year ended 31 March 2017, its annualised 20-year real rate of return was 3.7%. In USD nominal terms, GIC achieved an annualised return of 5.1%, 4.3% and 5.7% for the 5-year, 10-year and 20-year time periods respectively. Governance and risk management The funds managed by GIC are owned by the Singapore Government. Its investment returns supplement the country's annual budget in areas such as education, R&D;, health care and physical environment. As a Fifth Schedule company under the Singapore Constitution, GIC is accountable in various key areas to the President of Singapore who is empowered under the constitution to obtain information to enable him to safeguard the country's reserves. The Auditor- General, who is appointed by the President of Singapore, submits an annual report to the President and Parliament on his audit of the Government and other bodies managing public funds. GIC manages risk by investing in a well- diversified portfolio, with a balanced distribution of asset classes and their underlying business sectors and geographies. This, too, is why GIC's performance has to be measured on the basis of its overall portfolio rather than by how much it makes or loses on individual investments. Its approach to \\"risk management\\" has three distinct components: portfolio risk; process risk and people risk. As a board member of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds, the successor of the International Working Group of SWFs that developed the Santiago Principles in October 2008, GIC publishes how it adopts and implements the voluntary set of principles and practices. New investment framework GIC implemented a new investment framework in 2013 to give it more flexibility to focus on \\"investments that may be riskier in the short term but would generate returns in the long-term.\\" The new framework defines more clearly GIC's risk and return drivers, its long-term investment objectives and the responsibilities of the GIC board and management. The new approach sees its portfolio structured under three drivers. Firstly, a 'Reference Portfolio is 65% made up of global equities and 35% of global bonds representing global markets. It characterises the risk that the Government is prepared for GIC to take in its long-term investment strategies. Next, the Policy Portfolio is made up of six core asset classes and aims to achieve superior returns over the long horizon and is the main driver of long-term returns. Last is the Active Portfolio, which seeks to outperform the Policy Portfolio, is of skill- based strategies, adopted by GIC's management within risk limits. The skill- based strategies includes choosing investment opportunities within each asset class and investing in asset classes not contained in the simplified Policy Portfolio and cross-asset class strategies.

He received an A.B. degree at Harvard University in 1961, where he was a Putnam Fellow, and a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1964. Adler completed his doctoral dissertation, titled \\"High energy neutrino reactions and conservations hypotheses\\", under the supervision of Sam Treiman.https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/2081377 He is the son of Irving Adler, Jewish American writer, and Ruth Adler and older brother of Peggy Adler. Adler became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1966, becoming a full Professor of Theoretical Physics in 1969, and was named \\"New Jersey Albert Einstein Professor\\" at the Institute in 1979. He was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1975.http://www.nasonline.org/member- directory/members/58348.html He has won the J. J. Sakurai Prize from the American Physical Society in 1988, and the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 1998, among other awards. Adler's seminal papers on high energy neutrino processes, current algebras, soft pion theorems, sum rules, and perturbation theory anomalies helped lay the foundations for the current standard model of elementary particle physics. In 2012, Adler contributed to a family venture when he wrote the foreword for his then 99-year-old father's 87th book, Solving the Riddle of Phyllotaxis: Why the Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Ratio Occur on Plants. The book's diagrams are by his sister Peggy.  Trace dynamics  In his book Quantum Theory as an Emergent Phenomenon, published 2004, Adler presented his trace dynamics, a framework in which quantum field theory emerges from a matrix theory. In this matrix theory, particles are represented by non-commuting matrices, and the matrix elements of bosonic and fermionic particles are ordinary complex numbers and non-commuting Grassmann numbers, respectively. Using the action principle, a Lagrangian can be constructed from the trace of a polynomial function of these matrices, leading to Hamiltonian equations of motion. The construction of a statistical mechanics of these matrix models leads, so Adler says, to an \\"emergent effective complex quantum field theory\\".Quantum Theory as an Emergent Phenomenon: Book review by Collin Carbno See also the review of Adler's trace dynamics in Tejinder P.

Set in Vienna in 1900, it shows ten amorous encounters across the social spectrum, from a street prostitute to a nobleman, with each scene involving one character from the previous episode. The French term 'La Ronde' can mean any of the following: circling around, doing the rounds, a round of drinks, a circular dance. The film won the BAFTA award for Best Film and was nominated for two Academy Awards; for Best Writing and Best Art Direction. Plot The master of ceremonies opens proceedings by telling the audience that they will see various episodes in the endless waltz of love. A prostitute takes a soldier under a bridge. The soldier picks up a chambermaid at a dance hall. The chambermaid willingly succumbs to the son of her employers. The young man starts an affair with the young wife of an older businessman. She then has an edgy discussion in bed with her husband. The husband takes a shopgirl to a private dining room and gets her drunk. The shopgirl falls for a poet, who is pursuing an affair with an actress. The actress invites a count to visit her in bed next morning. That evening, he gets drunk and ends up in the bed of the prostitute, so completing the circle.

Censorship The film was classified by New York film censors as \\"immoral\\" and therefore unacceptable for public screenings. At the end of 1953, the film's producers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and, in 1954, La Ronde was approved for exhibition in New York without any cuts.

History Contrary to the name, the association does not administer the game in India, a task that falls to the All India Football Federation (AIFF). However, before the formation of the AIFF the IFA was in de facto control of football in India by virtue of its administration by Englishmen as well as its affiliation to the Football Association of England. The IFA was instrumental in creating the AIFF to govern football on a national basis. Clubs from outside West Bengal complained about the lack of neutrality in the affairs of the IFA. This disillusionment of clubs and patrons led to the formation of associations such as the Western Indian Football Association, which preferred to be governed by themselves rather than by the IFA. Later, the IFA helped form the AIFF.

In October 2020, in response to the Conservative government's attempt to control Covid-19 through a three tier system, Walker said that the government seemed to think it could \\"abolish death\\" and should accept that elderly people died. He also accused scientists on the government‚Äôs Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies committee of choosing to ‚Äúramp up‚Äù the ‚Äúfear factor‚Äù regarding the disease.https://m.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/charles-walker-abolish-death- coronavirus_uk_5f848396c5b6e5c3200205b5?guccounter=1&guce;_referrer=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY28udWsvc2VhcmNoP3E9Y2hhcmxlcyt3YWxrZXIrbXArYWJvbGlzaCtkZWF0aCZvcT1jaGFlbGVzK3dhbGtlcittcCthYm9sc2h2ZGVhdGgmZ3NfbD1tb2JpbGUtaGVpcmxvb20taHAuMS4wLjMwaTEwLjQ3MDAuMTQ3OTEuMC4xNjEzMy4zMS4zMC4wLjEuMS4wLjMxOC41MTU1LjBqMjNqNmoxLjMwLjAuLi4uMC4uLjFjLjEuMzQubW9iaWxlLWhlaXJsb29tLWhwLi4zLjI4LjQ1MDAubldOSEQwTUZxbEk&guce;_referrer_sig=AQAAAG6lfveAbasTCQoS1z1vnkVuPKHG24M2pPBMOuGC7-Fh9GmVI9CW8CKhfBlMDQZl- GwAl_IUqPvaMsAMUMpvsvLrq8ZvYDqsq7HfaKLKV5EWTKzDXE6YgPStyf6eEsREyq_LroSRHa1ZOO5SRd_gbwDOh5kSfuLhPqWD-9jNf3vT =Relationship with Speaker Bercow= In October 2012, he was elected as chairman of the Procedure Committee, which decides on the process for election of a new Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to his chairing duties, Walker is a member of the Speaker's Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (SCIPSA) and answers Parliamentary questions on behalf of the Committee. His championship of the pay rise and membership of the Committee led to him being described by The Daily Telegraph as being in with an outside chance of becoming speaker when John Bercow stands down. In the last parliamentary session before the 2015 general election, Walker explained what he knew about the Government decision to force a vote on changing the rules for electing a speaker for the next parliament. Conservative MPs disliked John Bercow. Walker said that he had written a report on the subject \\"years ago\\" but although he had talked to William Hague and Michael Gove that week, neither had told him their objectives. He had only found out via the grapevine, and stated that he would rather be an honourable fool than part of a plot. The government lost the vote and Walker received a standing ovation. =Contribution to destigmatising mental health issues= Walker has lived with obsessive-compulsive disorder for more than 30 years, stating his disability in 2012 whilst Labour's Kevan Jones simultaneously described his problems with depression.

It is common throughout the North and South Islands to Banks Peninsula (43¬∞45‚Ä≤S) and Okarito (43¬∞20‚Ä≤S), on the Three Kings Islands, on Raoul Island in the Kermadecs, and on the Chatham Islands. It is widespread in coastal habitats, often forming a major component of coastal forest, though it rarely dominates. Most botanists consider it to be native only to the northern half of the North Island, having been planted elsewhere by MƒÅori near former village sites, and subsequently spread by birds. The common name karaka comes from the MƒÅori language, and is also the MƒÅori term for the colour orange, from the colour of the fruit. In the Chatham Islands, it is called k≈çpƒ´, its name in the Moriori language. It is naturalised and considered invasive in Hawaii. Description Mature tree showing trunk and foliage kernels. Karaka is a leafy canopy tree with erect or spreading branches. It grows to heights up to 15 m and has a stout trunk up to 1 m in diameter. The thick, leathery leaves are glossy, dark green above and paler beneath, 50‚Äì200 mm long, and 30‚Äì70 mm wide with petioles 10‚Äì15 mm long. In winter and spring (August to November), karaka produces stout, erect panicles of tiny flowers. Individual flowers are 4‚Äì5 mm in diameter and greenish-cream to off-white or pale yellow. The fruit is an ellipsoid to ovoid drupe 25‚Äì46 mm long, with pale yellow to orange flesh, containing a single seed. The fruit ripens in summer and autumn (January to April) and the seeds are mostly dispersed by columbiform birds which eat the fruit. Ecology This evergreen tree is a popular place for smaller birds to sleep during the winter. It is of great value to birds and other fauna, including invertebrates that feed on their fruits and disperse their seeds. The ability to bear fruit in early summer (January) gives this plant an important ecological value, being a good food source for many species, especially birds, at a time when most other berries are not yet ripe. Centuries ago the seeds would have been dispersed by moa, but now most of the seed crop lies beneath the tree where carpets of shade suppressed seedlings grow. Cultivation Karaka may be easily grown from fresh seed, but cuttings are very difficult to strike. Young plants are frost-tender and sensitive to cold. The tree often naturalises in suitable habitats. It is common in cultivation and widely available for sale both in New Zealand and in suitable climates elsewhere. It was widely cultivated by the MƒÅori. Toxicity and uses The pulp of ripe fruit is edible, sweet and aromatic, but the fresh kernels contain the toxic alkaloid karakin. Accounts from the 19th century record that extensive processing was used by MƒÅori to convert the kernels to an edible form, and mention that if the processing was not done with the greatest care, poisoning would result with symptoms including violent convulsions and severe muscle spasms which could leave the limbs permanently fixed in contorted positions. Death resulted in a few cases. The berries are toxic if ingested by dogs and may result in death. Culture On the Chatham Islands this tree (locally known as kopi)Chatham Islands - Te Ara encyclopedia http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/chatham-islands/page-3 has played a distinguished role in the history of Moriori people: the soft bark of these trees has been used for making dendroglyphs.Wondermondo armchair guide to world attractions http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Au/NZ/Chatham/Hapupu.htm A report in 2000 noted the existence of 147 kopi trees with dendroglyphs, though some may not have been authentically Moriori.Fraser W.

The Nihon Shoki stated that Shinatsuhiko was born after Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto created the great eight islands of Japan. After these lands were completed, Izanagi blew at the morning mists that obscured them and these became Shinatsuhiko, God of the Wind.

He was one of the most prominent print designers of the shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") movement, whose artists depicted traditional subjects with a style influenced by Western art. Like earlier prints, Hasui's works were commonly landscapes, but his prints featured everyday scenes and natural lighting.  Life  From youth Hasui dreamed of an art career, but his parents had him take on the family rope and thread wholesaling business. Its bankruptcy when he was 26 freed him to pursue art. He approached Kiyokata Kaburagi to teach him, but Kaburagi instead encouraged him to study Western-style painting, which he did with Okada Sabur≈çsuke for two years. Two years later he again applied as a student to Kaburagi, who this time accepted him. After seeing an exhibition of Shinsui It≈ç's Eight Views of Lake Biwa Hasui approached Shinsui's publisher Sh≈çzabur≈ç Watanabe, who had Hasui make three experimental prints that Watanabe published in August 1918. The series Twelve Views of Tokyo, Eight Views of the Southeast, and the first Souvenirs of Travel of 16 prints followed in 1919, each issued two prints at a time. Hasui's twelve-print A Collection of Scenes of Japan begun in 1922 went unfinished when the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake destroyed Watanabe's workshop, including the finished woodblocks for the yet-undistributed prints and Hasui's sketchbooks. Hasui travelled the Hokuriku, San'in, and San'y≈ç regions later in 1923 and upon his return in February 1924 developed his sketches into his third Souvenirs of Travel series. Kawase studied ukiyo-e and Japanese style painting at the studio of Kiyokata Kaburagi. He mainly concentrated on making watercolors of actors, everyday life and landscapes, many of them published as illustrations in books and magazines in the last few years of the Meiji period and early Taish≈ç period. During the forty years of his artistic career, Hasui worked closely with Sh≈çzabur≈ç Watanabe, publisher and advocate of the shin- hanga movement. His works became widely known in the West through American connoisseur Robert O. Muller (1911‚Äì2003). In 1956, he was named a Living National Treasure in Japan. Hasui's younger brother Kasuke moved to London in 1916 to work as an accountant for Okura and Co, he married an English woman, Clara Greenfield, they have one surviving daughter Kathleen and grand daughter Karen Kawase. His maternal uncle was Kanagaki Robun (‰ªÆÂêçÂû£ È≠ØÊñá?) with the pen name of Nozaki Bunz≈ç (ÈáéÂ¥é ÊñáËîµ?) (1829‚Äì1894), a Japanese author and journalist, producing the first manga magazine. Style Kawase worked almost exclusively on landscape and townscape prints based on sketches he made in Tokyo and during travels around Japan. However, his prints are not merely meish≈ç (famous places) prints that are typical of earlier ukiyo-e masters such as Hiroshige and Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849). Kawase's prints feature locales that are tranquil and obscure in urbanizing Japan. Hasui considered himself a realist and employed his training in Western painting in his compositions. Like Hiroshige he made travel and landscape prints, though his subjects were less known locations rendered with naturalistic light, shade, and texture, without the captions and titles that were standard in prints of Hiroshige's age. Kawase left a large body of woodblock prints and watercolors: many of the watercolors are linked to the woodblock prints. He also produced oil paintings, traditional hanging scrolls and a few by≈çbu (folding screens). In the West, Kawase is mainly known as a Japanese woodblock printmaker. He and Hiroshi Yoshida are widely regarded as two of the greatest artists of the shin-hanga style, and are known especially for their landscape prints.

Hamm The Quakers in America 2006 Page 101 \\"They point to the testimony of simplicity as one of the distinguishing aspects of Quakerism. The journey from plainness to simplicity was complicated, but some understanding of it is necessary to understand what simplicity means for ...\\" Friends believe that a person‚Äôs spiritual life and character are more important than the quantity of goods he possesses or his monetary worth. Friends also believe that one should use one‚Äôs resources, including money and time, deliberately in ways that are most likely to make life truly better for oneself and others. The word testimony describes the way that Friends testify or bear witness to their beliefs in their everyday life. A testimony is therefore not a belief, but is committed action arising out of Friends' religious experience. Testimony to simplicity includes the practice among Quakers (members of the Religious Society of Friends) of being more concerned with one‚Äôs inner condition than one‚Äôs outward appearance and with other people more than oneself.  General explanation  Early Friends believed that it was important to avoid fanciness in dress, speech, and material possessions, because those things tend to distract one from waiting on God‚Äôs personal guidance. They also tend to cause a person to focus on himself more than on his fellow human beings, in violation of Jesus‚Äô teaching to \\"love thy neighbor as thyself\\". This emphasis on plainness, as it was called, made the Friends in certain times and places easily recognizable to the society around them, particularly by their plain dress in the 18th and 19th centuries.Thomas D Hamm on Plainness in The Quakers in America on Google Books. Simplicity to Friends has generally been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to what they need to live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony is not just about the nature of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden. In recent decades Friends have given the Testimony an ecological dimension: that Friends should not use more than their fair share of the Earth's limited resources. Like many aspects of Quaker life, the practice of plainness has evolved over time, although it is based on principles that have been a lasting part of Quaker thought. These principles now form part of the Quaker testimonies. Plainness is an extension of the testimony of simplicity and can still be observed today among modern Friends who do not follow fashion trends or purchase extravagant clothing. This testimony also finds expression in the tradition of plain walls and functional furniture in Quaker meeting houses.  Simplicity in dress  Traditionally, wearing plain dress was an answer to a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social inequality and make statements about wealth. Only a select few could afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing would not want to be seen socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of expensive new styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important things in life. Notably, Friends did not consider it right to judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but expensive new trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends were obviously identifiable. As fashions changed over time, the Quaker ideal of plain dress stood out against contemporary clothing. As a result, the traditional forms of this practice were dropped by most Friends. Today, it is more likely that Friends will try to put their faith into action by dressing in a plain version of current fashions ‚Äî such as avoiding clothing displaying designer labels. They may also try to buy only the clothing they need, and pay more for fairly traded clothing that has been made ethically. Friends used to have a strong tradition of simplicity in dress, more properly called \\"plain dress\\". Plain dress generally meant wearing clothes that were very similar to Amish or conservative Mennonite dress: often in dark colors and lacking adornments such as fancy (or any) pockets, buttons, buckles, lace, or embroidery.\\"Quaker Jane\\" on Plain dress Farnworth One-Name study ‚Äì article comparing Quakers and Puritans. This was widely practiced until the late 19th and early 20th century, when most Friends began dressing more like the rest of society. As the Quaker Oats brand shares the Quaker name, despite having no links with the Society of Friends, there is now a somewhat popular misconception that Friends today still wear the traditional clothing. A very small minority of contemporary Friends have taken up the traditional dress once again. Traditional plain dress survived longer in the conservative branches of Quakerism, which is today represented by meetings such as Ohio Yearly Meeting, where there exist Friends who have kept plain dress alive up to the present day.The Conservative Friend website FAQs: \\"So what about the funny clothes?

Thomas Hamm, in his book Quakers in America, describes a transition among most Friends from plainness to simplicity.  Simplicity in speech  Plainness in speech addressed other concerns than materialism: honesty, avoiding class distinction and vestiges of paganism, and the speaking of truth. These principles were put into practice by affirming rather than making an oath or shaking hands to agree upon a deal, setting fixed prices for goods, avoiding the use of honorific titles and using familiar forms for the second person pronoun. Early Friends also objected to the names of the days and months in the English language, because many of them referred to Roman or Norse gods, such as Mars (March) and Thor (Thursday), and Roman emperors, such as Julius (July). As a result, the days of the week were known as \\"First Day\\" for Sunday, \\"Second Day\\" for Monday, and so forth. Similarly, the months of the year were \\"First Month\\" for January, \\"Second Month\\" for February, and so forth. For many Friends today, this is no longer a priority, though the tradition is still kept up by some‚Äîespecially in the term \\"First-Day school\\" for Sunday schools organized by Friends. Many Friends organizations continue to use the \\"simple calendar\\" for official records. Early Friends practiced plainness in speech by not referring to people in the \\"fancy\\" ways that were customary. Often Friends would address high-ranking persons using the familiar forms of \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\", instead of the respectful \\"you\\". Later, as \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\" disappeared from everyday English usage, many Quakers continued to use these words as a form of \\"plain speech\\", though the original reason for this usage disappeared, along with \\"hath\\". In the twentieth century, \\"thou hath\\" disappeared, along with the associated second-person verb forms, so that \\"thee is\\" is normal.George Fox, Prescriptivist Today there are still Friends that will use \\"thee\\" with other Quakers. (Note: in 17th century English the forms above would have been \\"thou hast\\" and \\"thou art\\".) In languages that today maintain the T-V distinction, usage varies. Following the British usage, early francophone Quakers preferred the use of the more informal tu to address even those who would by convention be addressed with the more formal vous. In more contemporary times, however, usage has swung the other way, and French-speaking Quakers today are more likely than others to use the formal vous. In part, this is a recognition of the complexity of the notion of simplicity in speech, whose intent might be understood to be not a requirement of informality, but a desire to address everyone \\"simply\\", i.e., uniformly. The rejection of the past use of tu by white French missionaries to address Africans may be a factor in the contemporary francophone usage.FWCC Glossary Titles, such as Mr., Mrs., Miss, Dr., Rev., etc., are often avoided by many Friends. Instead Friends tend to address each other by first and last name with no title. In many Quaker communities children address adults by either their first names, or first and last names but with no title, and in many Quaker schools teachers are called by their first names as well. It is conventional for Friends who do not know each other well, who in non-Quaker circles would address each other with a title, to use first name and last name together, rather than to adopt the more familiar first name only. Friends also tend not to use the appellation sir or madam to refer to someone of whom they do not know the name, instead using the term Friend. In letter-writing, where others might use the phrase Dear Sir or Madam, many Quakers would instead write Dear Friend, and in such letters, rather than finishing yours faithfully would finish either yours in truth or yours in friendship. This practice is now considered more a part of the Testimony of Equality than a part of the Testimony of Simplicity. Additionally early Friends and modern Friends do not swear oaths, even in courtrooms (a choice that has been allowed in Britain since 1695, and is protected in the United States by the Constitution, and one that can be problematic elsewhere). When required, Quakers may instead \\"affirm\\" that they are going to tell the truth. This was considered an aspect of simplicity because it was simply telling the truth rather than embellishing it with an oath, which is not necessary if one is supposed to always tell the truth. It is also an aspect of the Testimony of Integrity. It comes in part from Christ's teaching in the sermon on the mount: In a similar manner Friends avoid haggling over prices. They simply set a fixed price that they considered fair, which went against the custom of earlier times, but was felt by them to be simpler and more honest (this practice is generally considered more a part of the Testimony of Integrity than a part of the Testimony of Simplicity). Simplicity in general life The Testimony of Simplicity is an important part of Quaker life, and many examples of its influence can be seen in both day-to-day and ceremonious practices. In keeping with the testimony, for example, many meetings that have care of a graveyard ask that those erecting monuments to deceased Friends keep the testimony in mind and erect only a simple, low-lying stone.

Redefined in 1977 by Jane Buikstra, bioarchaeology in the United States now refers to the scientific study of human remains from archaeological sites, a discipline known in other countries as osteoarchaeology or palaeo-osteology. Compared to bioarchaelogy, osteoarchaeolgy is the scientific study that solely focus on the human skeleton. The Human skeleton issued to tell us about health, lifestyle, diet, mortality and physique of the past. Furthermore, palaeo-osteology is simple the study of ancient bones. Bioarchaeology digs a bit deeper. The term 'bioarchaeology' is borrowed to cover all biological remains from sites in England and other European countries. Bioarchaeology was largely born from the practices of New Archaeology, which developed in the United States in the 1970s as a reaction to a mainly cultural-historical approach to understanding the past. Proponents of New Archaeology advocated using processual methods to test hypotheses about the interaction between culture and biology, or a biocultural approach. Some archaeologists advocate a more holistic approach to bioarchaeology that incorporates critical theory and is more relevant to modern descent populations. If possible, human remains from archaeological sites are analyzed to determine sex, age, and health. which all fall under the term 'Bioarchaeology'.  Paleodemography  Bioarchaeologists sometimes create life tables, a type of cohort analysis, to understand the demographic characteristics (such as risk of death or sex ratio) of a given age cohort within a population. Age and sex are crucial variables in the construction of a life table, although this information is often not available to bioarchaeologists. Therefore, it is often necessary to estimate the age and sex of individuals based on specific morphological characteristics of the skeleton. = Age estimation = The estimation of age in bioarchaeology and osteology actually refers to an approximation of skeletal or biological age- at-death. The primary assumption in age estimation is that an individual's skeletal age is closely associated with their chronological age. Age estimation can be based on patterns of growth and development or degenerative changes in the skeleton. Many methods tracking these types of changes have been developed using a variety of skeletal series. For instance, in children age is typically estimated by assessing their dental development, ossification and fusion of specific skeletal elements, or long bone length. In adults, degenerative changes to the pubic symphysis, the auricular surface of the ilium, the sternal end of the 4th rib, and dental attrition are commonly used to estimate skeletal age. = Sex determination = Differences in male and female skeletal anatomy are used by bioarchaeologists to determine the biological sex of human skeletons. Humans are sexually dimorphic, although overlap in body shape and sexual characteristics is possible. Not all skeletons can be assigned a sex, and some may be wrongly identified as male or female. Sexing skeletons is based on the observation that biological males and biological females differ most in the skull and pelvis; bioarchaeologists focus on these parts of the body when determining sex, although other body parts can also be used. The female pelvis is generally broader than the male pelvis, and the angle between the two inferior pubic rami (the sub-pubic angle) is wider and more U-shaped, while the sub-pubic angle of the male is more V-shaped and less than 90 degrees. Phenice details numerous visual differences between the male and female pelvis. In general, the male skeleton is more robust than the female skeleton because of the greater muscles mass of the male. Males generally have more pronounced brow ridges, nuchal crests, and mastoid processes. It should be remembered that skeletal size and robustness are influenced by nutrition and activity levels. Pelvic and cranial features are considered to be more reliable indicators of biological sex. Sexing skeletons of young people who have not completed puberty is more difficult and problematic than sexing adults, because the body has not had time to develop fully. Bioarchaeological sexing of skeletons is not error-proof. In reviewing the sexing of Egyptian skulls from Qua and Badari, Mann found that 20.3% could be assigned to a different sex than the sex indicated in the archaeological literature. A re-evalutaion of Mann's work showed that he did not understand the tomb numbering system of the old excavation and assigned wrong tomb numbers to the skulls. The sexing of the bone material was actually quite correct.Tatjana Beuthe: On the vailidity of Sexing data from early excavations: examples from Qua, in Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, 99 (2013), 308-311 However, recording errors and re-arranging of human remains may play a part in this great incidence of misidentification. Direct testing of bioarchaeological methods for sexing skeletons by comparing gendered names on coffin plates from the crypt at Christ Church, Spitalfields, London to the associated remains resulted in a 98 percent success rate.Molleson, Theya, and M. Cox. The Spitalfields Project, Volume 2: The Anthropology: Council For British Archaeology, York, 1993. Sex-based differences are not inherently a form of inequality, but become an inequality when members of one sex are given privileges based on their sex. This stems from society investing differences with cultural and social meaning.Ames, Kenneth M. \\"The Archaeology of Rank.\\" Handbook of Archaeological Theories. Eds. R. Alexander Bently, Herbert D. G. Maschner and Christopher Chippendale. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2008. 487‚Äì513. Gendered work patterns may make their marks on the bones and be identifiable in the archaeological record. Molleson found evidence of gendered work patterns by noting extremely arthritic big toes, a collapse of the last dorsal vertebrae, and muscular arms and legs among female skeletons at Abu Hureyra. She interpreted this sex-based pattern of skeletal difference as indicative of gendered work patterns. These kinds of skeletal changes could have resulted from women spending long periods of time kneeling while grinding grain with the toes curled forward. Investigation of gender from mortuary remains is of growing interest to archaeologists.Arnold, Bettina, and Nancy L. Wicker. Gender and the Archaeology of Death. Walnut Creek, CA: Alta Mira Press, 2001  Non-specific stress indicators  = Dental non-specific stress indicators =  Enamel hypoplasia  Enamel hypoplasia refers to transverse furrows or pits that form in the enamel surface of teeth when the normal process of tooth growth stops, resulting in a deficit of enamel. Enamel hypoplasias generally form due to disease and/or poor nutrition.Mays, Simon. The Archaeology of Human Bones. 1998. Second ed. New York: Routledge, 2010. 2010. Linear furrows are commonly referred to as linear enamel hypoplasias (LEHs); LEHs can range in size from microscopic to visible to the naked eye. By examining the spacing of perikymata grooves (horizontal growth lines), the duration of the stressor can be estimated,Humphrey, Louise T. Enamel Traces of Early Lifetime Events. Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology: Cambridge University Press, 2008. although Mays argues that the width of the hypoplasia bears only an indirect relationship to the duration of the stressor. Studies of dental enamel hypoplasia are used to study child health. Unlike bone, teeth are not remodeled, so they can provide a more reliable indicator of past health events as long as the enamel remains intact. Dental hypoplasias provide an indicator of health status during the time in childhood when the enamel of the tooth crown is being formed. Not all of the enamel layers are visible on the surface of the tooth because enamel layers that are formed early in crown development are buried by later layers. Hypoplasias on this part of the tooth do not show on the surface of the tooth. Because of this buried enamel, teeth record stressors form a few months after the start of the event. The proportion of enamel crown formation time represented by this buried in enamel varies from up to 50 percent in molars to 15-20 percent in anterior teeth. Surface hypoplasias record stressors occurring from about one to seven years, or up to 13 years if the third molar is included.Mays, Simon. The Archaeology of Human Bones. 1998. Second ed. New York: Routledge, 2010. = Skeletal non-specific stress indicators =  Porotic hyperostosis/cribra orbitalia  It was long assumed that iron deficiency anemia has marked effects on the flat bones of the cranium of infants and young children. That as the body attempts to compensate for low iron levels by increasing red blood cell production in the young, sieve-like lesions develop in the cranial vaults (termed porotic hyperostosis) and/or the orbits (termed cribra orbitalia). This bone is spongy and soft.Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. P√©rez. Bioarchaeology: An Integrated Approach to Working with Human Remains. New York: Springer, 2013. It is however, highly unlikely that iron deficiency anemia is a cause of either porotic hyperostosis or cribra orbitalia.Walker et al. 2009 \\"The Causes of Porotic Hyperostosis and Cribra Orbitalia: A Reappraisal of the Iron- Deficiency-Anemia Hypothesis\\" American Journal of Physical Anthropology. These are more likely the result of vascular activity in these areas and are unlikely to be pathological. The development of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis could also be attributed to other causes besides an iron deficiency in the diet, such as nutrients lost to intestinal parasites. However, dietary deficiencies are the most probable cause.Schutkowski, Holger. \\"Thoughts for Food: Evidence and Meaning of Past Dietary Habits.\\" Between Biology and Culture. Ed. Holger Schutkowski. Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology: Cambridge University Press, 2008. 141‚Äì64. Anemia incidence may be a result of inequalities within society, and/or indicative of different work patterns and activities among different groups within society. A study of iron-deficiency among early Mongolian nomads showed that although overall rates of cribra orbitalia declined from 28.7 percent (27.8 percent of the total female population, 28.4 percent of the total male population, 75 percent of the total juvenile population) during the Bronze and Iron Ages, to 15.5 percent during the Hunnu (2209‚Äì1907 BP) period, the rate of females with cribra orbitalia remained roughly the same, while the incidence of cribra orbitalia among males and children declined (29.4 percent of the total female population, 5.3 percent of the total male population, and 25 percent of the juvenile population had cribra orbitalia).Bazarsad, Naran. \\"Iron-Deficiency Anemia in Early Mongolian Nomads.\\" Ancient Health: Skeletal Indicators of Agricultural and Economic Intensification. Eds. Mark Nathan Cohen and Gillian M.M. Crane-Kramer. Gainesville/Tallahassee/Tampa/Boca Raton: University Press of Florida, 2007. 250‚Äì54. Bazarsad posits several reasons for this distribution of cribra orbitalia: adults may have lower rates of cribra orbitalia than juveniles because lesions either heal with age or lead to death. Higher rates of cribia orbitalia among females may indicate lesser health status, or greater survival of young females with cribia orbitalia into adulthood.  Harris lines  Harris lines form before adulthood, when bone growth is temporarily halted or slowed down due to some sort of stress (either disease or malnutrition). During this time, bone mineralization continues, but growth does not, or does so at very reduced levels. If and when the stressor is overcome, bone growth will resume, resulting in a line of increased mineral density that will be visible in a radiograph. If there is not recovery from the stressor, no line will be formed. = Hair = The stress hormone cortisol is deposited in hair as it grows. This has been used successfully to detect fluctuating levels of stress in the later lifespan of mummies.  Mechanical stress and activity indicators  Examining the effects that activities and workload has upon the skeleton allows the archaeologist to examine who was doing what kinds of labor, and how activities were structured within society. The division of labor within the household may be divided according to gender and age, or be based on other hierarchical social structures. Human remains can allow archaeologists to uncover patterns in the division of labor. Living bones are subject to Wolff's law, which states that bones are physically affected and remodeled by physical activity or inactivity. Increases in mechanical stress tend to produce bones that are thicker and stronger. Disruptions in homeostasis caused by nutritional deficiency or disease or profound inactivity/disuse/disability can lead to bone loss. While the acquisition of bipedal locomotion and body mass appear to determine the size and shape of children's bones, activity during the adolescent growth period seems to exert a greater influence on the size and shape of adult bones than exercise later in life. Muscle attachment sites (also called entheses) have been thought to be impacted in the same way causing what were once called musculoskeletal stress markers, but now widely named entheseal changes. These changes were widely used to study activity- patterns, but research has shown that processes associated with aging have a greater impact than occupational stresses. It has also been shown that geometric changes to bone structure (described above) and entheseal changes differ in their underlying cause with the latter poorly affected by occupation. Joint changes, including osteoarthritis, have also been used to infer occupations but in general these are also manifestations of the aging process. Markers of occupational stress, which include morphological changes to the skeleton and dentition as well as joint changes at specific locations have also been widely used to infer specific (rather than general) activities. Such markers are often based on single cases described in clinical literature in the late nineteenth century. One such marker has been found to be a reliable indicator of lifestyle: the external auditory exostosis also called surfer's ear, which is a small bony protuberance in the ear canal which occurs in those working in proximity to cold water. One example of how these changes have been used to study activities is the New York African Burial Ground in New York. This provides evidence of the brutal working conditions under which the enslaved labored;Wilczak, C., R.C. Watkins, and M.L. Blakey. Skeletal Indicators of Work: Musculoskeletal, Arthritic, and Traumatic Events: US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 2004. osteoarthritis of the vertebrae was very common, even among the young. The pattern of osteoarthritis combined with the early age of onset provides evidence of labor that resulted in mechanical strain to the neck. One male skeleton shows stress lesions at 37 percent of 33 muscle or ligament attachments, showing he experienced significant musculoskeletal stress. Overall, the interred show signs of significant musculoskeletal stress and heavy workloads, although workload and activities varied among different individuals. Some individuals show high levels of stress, while others do not. This references the variety of types of labor (e.g., domestic vs. carrying heavy loads) labor that enslaved individuals were forced to perform. = Injury and workload = Fractures to bones during or after excavation will appear relatively fresh, with broken surfaces appearing white and unweathered. Distinguishing between fractures around the time of death and post-depositional fractures in bone is difficult, as both types of fractures will show signs of weathering. Unless evidence of bone healing or other factors are present, researchers may choose to regard all weathered fractures as post-depositional. Evidence of perimortal fractures (or fractures inflicted on a fresh corpse) can be distinguished in unhealed metal blade injuries to the bones. Living or freshly dead bones are somewhat resilient, so metal blade injuries to bone will generate a linear cut with relatively clean edges rather than irregular shattering. Archaeologists have tried using the microscopic parallel scratch marks on cut bones in order to estimate the trajectory of the blade that caused the injury.Wenham, S.J., and J. Wakely. Features of Blade-Injuries to Bone Surfaces in Six Anglo-Saxon Skeletons from Eccles, Kent: BAR 211 Oxford, 1989.  Diet and dental health  = Caries = Dental caries, commonly referred to as cavities or tooth decay, are caused by localized destruction of tooth enamel, as a result of acids produced by bacteria feeding upon and fermenting carbohydrates in the mouth. Subsistence based upon agriculture is strongly associated with a higher rate of caries than subsistence based upon foraging, because of the higher levels of carbohydrates in diets based upon agriculture. For example, bioarchaeologists have used caries in skeletons to correlate a diet of rice and agriculture with the disease. Females may be more vulnerable to caries compared to men, due to lower saliva flow than males, the positive correlation of estrogens with increased caries rates, and because of physiological changes associated with pregnancy, such as suppression of the immune system and a possible concomitant decrease in antimicrobial activity in the oral cavity.  Stable isotope analysis  Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in human bone collagen allows bioarchaeologists to carry out dietary reconstruction and to make nutritional inferences. These chemical signatures reflect long-term dietary patterns, rather than a single meal or feast. Stable isotope analysis monitors the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 (13C/12C), which is expressed as parts per mil (per thousand) using delta notation (Œ¥13C). The ratio of carbon isotopes varies according to the types of plants consumed with different photosynthesis pathways. The three photosynthesis pathways are C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and Crassulacean acid metabolism. C4 plants are mainly grasses from tropical and subtropical regions, and are adapted to higher levels of radiation than C3 plants. Corn, millet and sugar cane are some well-known C4 domesticates, while all trees and shrubs use the C3 pathway.Bocherens, Herve. \\"Preservation of Isotopic Signals (13c, 15n) in Pleistocene Mammals.\\" Biogeochemical Approaches to Paleodietary Analysis. Ed. Stanley H Ambrose. New York, New York: KluwerAcademic/Plenum Publishers, 2001. C3 plants are more common and numerous than C4 plants. Both types of plants occur in tropical areas, but only C3 plants occur naturally in colder areas. 12C and 13C occur in a ratio of approximately 98.9 to 1.1. The 13C and 12C ratio is either depleted (more negative) or enriched (more positive) relative to the international standard, which is set to an arbitrary zero. The different photosynthesis pathways used by C3 and C4 plants cause them to discriminate differently towards 13C The C4 and C3 plants have distinctly different ranges of 13C; C4 plants range between -9 and -16 per mil, and C3 plants range between -22 to -34 per mil. Œ¥13C studies have been used in North America to document the transition from a C3 to a C4 (native North American plants to corn) diet. The rapid and dramatic increase in 13C after the adoption of maize agriculture attests to the change in the southeastern American diet by 1300 CE. Isotope ratios in food, especially plant food, are directly and predictably reflected in bone chemistry,Burton, James H., and T. Douglas Price. \\"The Use and Abuse of Trace Elelments for Paleodietary Analysis.\\" Biogeochemical Approaches to Paleodietary Analysis. Eds. Stanley H. Ambose and M. Anne Katzenberg.

Mark Nathan Cohen and George L. Armelagos. New York, New York: Academic Press, Inc., 1984. Nitrogen isotopes (14N and 15N) have been used to estimate the relative contributions of legumes verses nonlegumes, as well as terrestrial versus marine resources to the diet. The increased consumption of legumes, or animals that eat them, causes 15N in the body to decrease. Nitrogen isotopes in bone collagen are ultimately derived from dietary protein, while carbon can be contributed by protein, carbohydrate, or fat in the diet. Compared to other plants, legumes have lower 14N/15N ratios because they can fix molecular nitrogen, rather than having to rely on nitrates and nitrites in the soil. Legumes have Œ¥15N values close to 0%, while other plants, which have Œ¥15N values that range from 2 to 6%. Nitrogen isotope ratios can be used to index the importance of animal protein in the diet. 15N increases about 3-4% with each trophic step upward. 15N values increase with meat consumption, and decrease with legume consumption. The 14N/15N ratio could be used to gauge the contribution of meat and legumes to the diet. Skeletons excavated from the Coburn Street Burial Ground (1750 to 1827 CE) in Cape Town, South Africa, were analyzed using stable isotope data by Cox et al. in order to determine geographical histories and life histories of the interred. The people buried in this cemetery were assumed to be slaves and members of the underclass based on the informal nature of the cemetery; biomechanical stress analysis and stable isotope analysis, combined with other archaeological data, seem to support this supposition. Based on stable isotope levels, eight Cobern Street Burial Ground individuals consumed a diet based on C4 (tropical) plants in childhood, then consumed more C3 plants, which were more common at the Cape later in their lives. Six of these individuals had dental modifications similar to those carried out by peoples inhabiting tropical areas known to be targeted by slavers who brought enslaved individuals from other parts of Africa to the colony. Based on this evidence, Cox et al. argue that these individuals represent enslaved persons from areas of Africa where C4 plants are consumed and who were brought to the Cape as laborers. Cox et al. do not assign these individuals to a specific ethnicity, but do point out that similar dental modifications are carried out by the Makua, Yao, and Marav peoples. Four individuals were buried with no grave goods, in accordance with Muslim tradition, facing Signal Hill, which is a point of significance for local Muslims. Their isotopic signatures indicate that they grew up in a temperate environment consuming mostly C3 plants, but some C4 plants. Many of the isotopic signatures of interred individuals indicate that they Cox et al. argue that these individuals were from the Indian Ocean area. They also suggest that these individuals were Muslims. Cox et al. argue that stable isotopic analysis of burials, combined with historical and archaeological data can be an effective way in of investigating the worldwide migrations forced by the African Slave Trade, as well as the emergence of the underclass and working class in the colonial Old World. Stable isotope analysis of strontium and oxygen can also be carried out. The amounts of these isotopes vary in different geological locations. Because bone is a dynamic tissue that is remodeled over time, and because different parts of the skeleton are laid down at particular times over the course of a human life, stable isotope analysis can be used to investigate population movements in the past and indicate where people lived at various points of their lives.  Archaeological uses of DNA  aDNA analysis of past populations is used by archaeology to genetically determine the sex of individuals, determine genetic relatedness, understand marriage patterns, and investigate prehistoric population movements.  Bioarchaeological treatments of equality and inequality  Aspects of the relationship between the physical body and socio- cultural conditions and practices can be recognized through the study of human remains. This is most often emphasized in a \\"biocultural bioarchaeology\\" model. It has often been the case that bioarchaeology has been regarded as a positivist, science-based discipline, while theories of the living body in the social sciences have been viewed as constructivist in nature. Physical anthropology and bioarchaeology have been criticized for having little to no concern for culture or history. BlakeyBlakey, Michael L. Introduction: Section 1: Background of the New York African Burial Ground Project. Philadelphia, PA: US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 2004. has argued that scientific or forensic treatments of human remains from archaeological sites construct a view of the past that is neither cultural nor historic, and has suggested that a biocultural version of bioarchaeology will be able to construct a more meaningful and nuanced history that is more relevant to modern populations, especially descent populations. By biocultural, Blakey means a type of bioarchaeology that is not simply descriptive, but combines the standard forensic techniques of describing stature, sex and age with investigations of demography and epidemiology in order to verify or critique socioeconomic conditions experienced by human communities of the past. The incorporation of analysis regarding the grave goods interred with individuals may further the understanding of the daily activities experienced in life. Currently, some bioarchaeologists are coming to view the discipline as lying at a crucial interface between the science and the humanities; as the human body is non-static, and is constantly being made and re-made by both biological and cultural factors.Lorentz, Kirsi. \\"From Bodies to Bones and Back: Theory and Human Bioarchaeology.\\" Between Biology and Culture.

It does not closely link skeletal remains to their archaeological context, and is best viewed as a \\"skeletal biology of the past.\\"Buikstra, Jane E. \\"Introduction to Section III: On to the 21st Century.\\" p. 354.

Inequalities exist in all human societies, even so-called ‚Äúegalitarian‚Äù ones. It is important to note that bioarchaeology has helped to dispel the idea that life for foragers of the past was ‚Äúnasty, brutish and short‚Äù; bioarchaeological studies have shown that foragers of the past were often quite healthy, while agricultural societies tend to have increased incidence of malnutrition and disease. However, based on a comparison of foragers from Oakhurst to agriculturalists from K2 and Mapungubwe, Steyn believes that agriculturalists from K2 and Mapungubwe were not subject to the lower nutritional levels expected for this type of subsistence system. Danforth argues that more ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù state-level societies display greater health differences between elites and the rest of society, with elites having the advantage, and that this disparity increases as societies become more unequal. Some status differences in society do not necessarily mean radically different nutritional levels; Powell did not find evidence of great nutritional differences between elites and commoners, but did find lower rates of anemia among elites in Moundville.Powell, M.L. Status and Health in Prehistory: A Case Study of the Moundville Chiefdom. Washington, DC: Smithson Inst., 1988. An area of increasing interest among bioarchaeologists interested in understanding inequality is the study of violence.Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. P√©rez, eds. The Bioarchaeology of Violence. Gainesville: University of Press Florida, 2012. Researchers analyzing traumatic injuries on human remains have shown that a person's social status and gender can have a significant impact on their exposure to violence.Martin, Debra L., Ryan P.

Archaeological ethics  There are ethical issues with bioarchaeology that revolve around treatment and respect for the dead. Large-scale skeletal collections were first amassed in the US in the 19th century, largely from the remains of Native Americans. No permission was ever granted from surviving family for study and display. Recently, federal laws such as NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) have allowed Native Americans to regain control over the skeletal remains of their ancestors and associated artifacts in order to reassert their cultural identities. NAGPRA passed in 1990. At this time, many archaeologists underestimated the public perception of archaeologists as non-productive members of society and grave robbers. Concerns about occasional mistreatment of Native American remains are not unfounded: in a Minnesota excavation 1971, White and Native American remains were treated differently; remains of White people were reburied, while remains of Native American people were placed in cardboard boxes and placed in a natural history museum. Blakey relates the growth in African American bioarchaeology to NAGPRA and its effect of cutting physical anthropologist off from their study of Native American remains. Bioarchaeology in Europe is not as affected by these repatriation issues as American bioarchaeology but regardless the ethical considerations associated with working with human remains are, and should, be considered. However, because much of European archaeology has been focused on classical roots, artifacts and art have been overemphasized and Roman and post-Roman skeletal remains were nearly completely neglected until the 1980s. Prehistoric archaeology in Europe is a different story, as biological remains began to be analyzed earlier than in classical archaeology.

He was the son of Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk and Catherine Brockholes. Howard was known for actively participating in the Tory party as part of the support for King George III. He also spent a considerable amount of his money rebuilding and refurbishing Arundel Castle after inheriting his title and lands. Family He married, firstly, Marion Coppinger (daughter of John Coppinger), on 1 August 1767, who died a year later giving birth. He married, secondly, Frances Scudamore (1750‚Äì1820), the only child of Charles FitzRoy-Scudamore and his wife Frances, formerly Duchess of Beaufort, on 6 April 1771 at London, England. Frances soon became insane after her marriage and was locked away until her death in 1820. Howard then lived with several mistresses. His longtime mistress, Mary Ann Gibbon (a cousin of Edward Gibbon), was reputed to be his secret third wife and she had five children by him, including two sons who were officers of arms, Matthew Howard-Gibbon, and Edward Howard-Gibbon. An older illegitimate son by a previous mistress, Sir William Woods, later became Garter King of Arms. Politics and letters Norfolk renounced his Catholicism to start his political life, but remained a staunch supporter of Catholic Emancipation, as well as opposing the war with the American colonies. He sat in Parliament from 1780 to 1784 and became a lord of the treasury in the Portland cabinet in 1783. He succeeded to the title of 11th Duke of Norfolk in 1786 upon the death of his father. Eventually he was dismissed from the lord lieutenancy of the West Riding in 1798 for toasting ‚ÄúOur sovereign‚Äôs health‚Äîthe majesty of the people‚Äù in terms displeasing to George III. He was known as the \\"Architectural Duke\\" for setting in motion the rebuilding of Arundel Castle, after over one hundred years of neglect, in the regency style. The 15th Duke disliked the 11th Duke's style but left his Library, which is regarded as the best room in the Castle. Norfolk wrote Historical Anecdotes of some of the Howard Family (1769 and 1817). He was a good friend of Sir Bysshe Shelley, allowing him in 1786 to make out the patent for his baronetcy. Shelley was influenced by Norfolk and built the flamboyant Castle Goring, one side of which was a partial copy of Norfolk's residence of Arundel Castle. Norfolk died on 16 December 1815 at age 69, without issue from either of his two legal marriages. Upon his death, his lands and titles passed to his cousin, Bernard.

Population geography involves demography in a geographical perspective. It focuses on the characteristics of population distributions that change in a spatial context. This often involves factors such as where populations are found and how the size and composition of these populations is regulated by the demographic processes of fertility, mortality, and migration. Contributions to population geography are cross-disciplinary because geographical epistemologies related to environment, place and space have been developed at various times. Related disciplines include geography, demography, sociology, and economics. Since its inception, population geography has taken at least three distinct but related forms, the most recent of which appears increasingly integrated with human geography in general. The earliest and most enduring form of population geography emerged in the 1950s, as part of spatial science. Pioneered by Glenn Trewartha, Wilbur Zelinsky, William A. V. Clark, and others in the United States, as well as Jacqueline Beujeau-Garnier and Pierre George in France, it focused on the systematic study of the distribution of population as a whole and the spatial variation in population characteristics such as fertility and mortality. Population geography defined itself as the systematic study of: # the simple description of the location of population numbers and characteristics # the explanation of the spatial configuration of these numbers and characteristics # the geographic analysis of population phenomena (the inter-relations among real differences in population with those in all or certain other elements within the geographic study area). Accordingly, it categorized populations as groups synonymous with political jurisdictions representing gender, religion, age, disability, generation, sexuality, and race, variables which go beyond the vital statistics of births, deaths, and marriages. Given the rapidly growing global population as well as the baby boom in affluent countries such as the United States, these geographers studied the relation between demographic growth, displacement, and access to resources at an international scale. Examples can be shown through population density maps. A few types of maps that show the spatial layout of population are choropleth, isoline, and dot maps. Topics in Population Geography * Demographic phenomena (natality, mortality, growth rates, etc.) through both space and time * Increases or decreases in population numbers * The movements and mobility of populations * Occupational structure * The way in which places in turn react to population phenomena, e.g. immigration Research topics of other geographic sub-disciplines, such as settlement geography, also have a population geography dimension: * The grouping of people within settlements * The way from the geographical of places, e.g. settlement patterns All of the above are looked at over space and time. Population geography also studies human-environment interactions, including problems from those relationships, such as overpopulation, pollution, and others..

Early life Ishizuka was born in rural Kitakanbara District, Niigata Prefecture. He moved to Tokyo in 1924, and found a job in a bookstore, while hoping to find a break into the literary world. His chance came when a friend introduced him to the famed novelist Yokomitsu Riichi, who agreed to take Ishizuka on as his disciple. However, Ishizuka was interested in poetry as well as prose, and also joined a literary circle organized by Hasegawa Reiyoshi. Literary career In 1933, Ishizuka contributed haiku verses to the Ashibi literary magazine. Around this time, he went to work for Tenbosha Books as an editor of the essay magazine, Buntai (\\"Style\\"). In 1935, he started his own bookstore, called Sara, which enabled him to publish works by Yokomitsu Riichi and Kawabata Yasunari, and the haiku anthologies of Nakamura Kusatao and Ishida Hakyo. He co-founded the haiku magazine, Tsuru (\\"Crane\\") in 1937 together with Ishida. In 1940, Ishizuka succeeded in publishing his own haiku anthology, Hosun Kyojitsu, which brought him to the attention of the haiku world. After the death of Ishida Hakyo in 1969, he took over full control of Tsuru. His other haiku anthologies include Iso Kaze (\\"Beach Wind\\"), Kojin (\\"Light Dust\\") and Tamanawa-sho. In 1942, Ishizuka changed from poetry to prose, and published the novel, Matsukaze (\\"Pine Wind\\"), serialized in the magazine Bungakukai. His subsequent novels included Seishun (\\"Youth\\") and Hashi-mori (\\"Bridge Guard\\"). Ishizuka lived in Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture from 1945 until his death in 1986 at the age of 79. In Kamakura, he was a member of the Nanboku (\\"North-South\\") literary circle organized by Atsuko Anzai and (through a recommendation by Kawabata Yasunari) was hired as an editor to the short-lived Kamakura magazine published by Kamakura Bunko.

Muzzleloading guns, both antique and reproduction, are used for target shooting, hunting, historical re-enactment and historical research. The sport originated in the United States in the 1930s, just as the last original users and makers of muzzleloading arms were dying out. The sport received a tremendous boost in the 1960s and 1970s. The Muzzle Loaders Associations International Committee (www.MLAIC.org) was formed in 1970 and held its first World Championship in 1971. Since then a flourishing industry manufacturing working reproductions of historic firearms now exists in the United States and Europe, particularly in northern Italy near Gardone. In the United States muzzleloading guns are, subject to a number of qualifications, generally not considered firearms. Subject to state law they may be possessed by persons who might otherwise not be legally allowed to own a firearm.ATF.gov Top 10 Frequently Asked Firearms Questions and Answers The American National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association holds two national tournaments a year in Friendship, Indiana as well as the Western National Shoot Event held in Phoenix, Ariz.. The Muzzle Loaders Associations International Committee (MLAIC) governs international competition with muzzle-loading arms. The MLAIC holds a Short Range World Championship in even-numbered years and a Long Range World Championship (300 to 1000 yards) on odd numbered years (South Africa has won the last 5 Long Range World Championships). Modern use Driven by demand for muzzleloaders for special extended primitive hunting seasons, firearms manufacturers have developed in-line muzzleloading rifles with designs similar to modern breech-loading centerfire designs. Knight Rifles pioneered the in- line muzzleloader in the mid-1980s, manufacturing and selling them to this day. Savage Arms has created the 10ML-II, which can be used with smokeless powder, reducing the cleaning required.

The title is also known as Living National Treasure. History  In 1950, the government of Japan began to designate certain individuals or groups who embodied intangible national cultural values as living human treasures. This was supplementary to buildings or places of great cultural and historical value that were designated as national treasures. Living Human Treasures thus became eligible for special protection and government support. Some of the ancient protected crafts initially were pottery, music, handmade paper, dolls, and swordmaking, but have been expanded to also include song, dance, cuisine, and other categories. Several countries have followed suit with their own official programmes of recognition for intangible cultural values and the people who embody them, including France, Philippines, Romania, South Korea and Thailand. In 1993, the government of South Korea proposed to the UNESCO Executive Board the establishment of a codified \\"Living Human Treasures\\" program for all member states. The board adopted a decision and invited member states to establish and promote such national systems. Through its Intangible Cultural Heritage section, UNESCO introduced definitions and guidelines for supporting such living human treasure programmes.\\"Guidelines for the Establishment of National 'Living Human Treasures' Systems\\", UNESCO, undated  Definitions  The member states at the 32nd UNESCO General Conference in October 2003 agreed to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.

Behavioral geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. In addition, behavioral geography is an ideology/approach in human geography that makes use of the methods and assumptions of behaviorism to determine the cognitive processes involved in an individual's perception of or response and reaction to their environment. Behavioral geography is that branch of human science, which deals with the study of cognitive processes with its response to its environment, through behaviorism.

Behavioral geography draws from early behaviorist works such as Tolman's concepts of \\"cognitive maps\\". More cognitively oriented, behavioral geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are materialists and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the landscape patterns or even group identity.Norton, W. (1997). Human geography and behavior analysis: An application of behavior analysis to the evolution of human landscapes. The Psychological Record, 47, 439‚Äì460 The cognitive processes include environmental perception and cognition, wayfinding, the construction of cognitive maps, place attachment, the development of attitudes about space and place, decisions and behavior based on imperfect knowledge of one's environs, and numerous other topics. The approach adopted in behavioral geography is closely related to that of psychology, but draws on research findings from a multitude of other disciplines including economics, sociology, anthropology, transportation planning, and many others.  The Social Construction of Nature  Nature is the world which surrounds us, including all life (plants, animals, organisms, humans, etc.) and physical features. Social Construction is the way that human beings process the world around us in our minds. According to Plato's 'Classical Theory of Categorization', humans create categories of what they see through experience and imagination.Gerber, J. (1997).

Retrieved from http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.925.2585&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf Social constructionism, therefore, is this characterization that makes language and semantics possible. If these experiences and imageries are not placed into categories, then the human ability to think about it becomes limited. The social construction of nature looks to question different truths and understandings for how people treat nature, based on when and where someone lives. In academic circles, researchers look at how truths exist (ontology) and how truths are justified (epistemology). Construction is both a process and an outcome, where people's understandings of the word nature can be both literal and metaphorical,Demerit, D. (2002). What is the 'social construction of nature'?

Keyword: A vocabulary of culture and society. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. It can also be used to discredit science or philosophy. As a subset of behavioral geography, the social construction of nature also includes environmental ethics and values, which affect how humans treat, and interact with, the natural environment. It incorporates ideas from environmental science, ecology, sociology, geography, biology, theology, philosophy, psychology, politics, economics, and other disciplines, to bring together the social, cultural and environmental dimensions of life. Social constructionism uses a lot of ideas from Western world thinking, but it is also incorporates truths from other world views, such as the Traditional Knowledge of Aboriginal groups, or more specifically ecofeminismMerchant, C.

Norton & Co. = The Role of Linguistics = Raymond Williams, author of Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society (1983). There are many ways of understanding and interpreting nature. According to Raymond Williams, there are three ways to give meaning to (or define) nature: # Nature as a quality, character or process (e.g. human nature) # Nature as a force (e.g. weather) # Nature as the material world (e.g. the physical environment) According to Raymond Williams, language plays a role in how we understand, interpret, and give meaning to nature. This is how multiple truths can be valid at the same time. = The Role of Mental Maps = Humans have the ability to create images of their environments through experiences in their mind.Lynch, D. (1960). The Image of the City. MA: Harvard University Press. These experiences allow us to create mental maps where we can create memories associated to space. It is a two-way process where the environment provides suggestions for what should be seen, and then the observer gives meaning with those suggestions. These images have three parts: # An identity # A pattern # A practical or emotional meaning According to Kevin Lynch, the environmental images (or mental maps) that we make can either be weak or strong, where the process is ongoing and never stops. = The Role of Science = Science occurs at many dimensions and scales that do not consider culture, but can be motivated by politics, economics and ethics.Pedynowski, D. (2003). Science(s) - which, when and whose? Probing the metanarrative of scientific knowledge in the social construction of nature.

According to Michel Foucault, a truth does not have to be close to reality for it to be worth something or have power. For Carolyn Merchant, science can only be given power if a truth is interpreted as having worth.  Schools of Thought  Relativism is important in the social construction of nature, as all truths are relative to the perspective they are coming from. There are two schools of thought on how the social construction of nature is relative: # Critical Realism (being realistic) # Pragmatism (being practical) Critical realists reject the idea of relativism and rely more on natural sciences. Pragmatists have no set opinion on the matter and rely on social science and ethics, instead. According to Richard Rorty, relativism is relevant to pragmatism in three ways: # Every belief is equally valid # There is no criteria for what a truth can be # That any truth can be justified by the society it comes from According to Gilbert White, pragmatism has four main assumptions: # That human existence is based on putting labor into the land # That the idea of owning anything is a conception # That humans learn from their experiences # That engagement of the publics is what allows for commitments Richard Rorty also associated three characteristics to pragmatism: # That all theories characterize some form of truth # That there is not difference between what can and should be done when it comes to the truth # That knowledge is constrained by the conversations we have Being pragmatic is the more accepted school of thought for social construction being a relative concept.

In 1938, he studied Halakha (traditional Jewish law) in the Hebron Yeshiva, and was ordained as a rabbi by chief rabbis Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel and Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. He was among the founders of a yeshiva high school Midrashiat Noam in Pardes Hanna, and served for two years as a teacher there, and became one of the founders of the religious Kibbutz Tirat Zvi in the Beit She'an Valley.Retired Justice Menachem Elon Dies at 90 The Elon family, a member of the religious Zionist elite, is entrenched in the world of law, politics, Literature, and Halakha (Jewish religious law). In 1949, Menachem Elon married Ruth Buchsbaum, the daughter of Dr. Mordechai Buchsbaum, an Orthodox Jewish attorney and a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem.

In 1979, Elon was awarded the Israel Prize for Hebrew law. Supreme Court of Israel In 1977, he was appointed to the Israeli Supreme Court. Elon's rulings often drew upon the principles of Jewish law; he sought to incorporate traditional Halakha into the corpus of Israeli civil law.\\"Our teacher\\" Menachem Elon By BERNARD AUERBACH Elon emerged as a prominent critic of former president of the Supreme Court Aharon Barak's judicial activism. Elon was involved in a number of important verdicts, including the acquittal of Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk. Among Elon's prominent decisions were a ruling prohibiting registering the character of non-Orthodox conversions on Israeli identity cards, one ordering the return of a girl who had been transferred for adoption without her parent's consent, and the decision to order a local religious service committee to accept Leah Shakdiel as its first female member.‚ÄòOur teacher‚Äô Menachem Elon In 1988, he ruled that active euthanasia (\\"mercy killing\\") was illegal, because it negated the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish state (Yael Shefer v. The State of Israel). In 1988, he was promoted to the position of deputy president of the Supreme Court, under Meir Shamgar. He served in this position until his retirement in 1993 after 16 years as a justice; he was succeeded as deputy president by Aharon Barak.

Wertheim grew up in Stralsund. After being an apprentice at Wolff and Apolant, Wertheim along with his brother Hugo, took over in 1876 their parents' (Abraham and Ida Wertheim) haberdashery, founded in 1875. The two brothers quickly brought new ideas into the shop: customers were allowed to replace goods, the price of a good was no longer debatable but reliable, and purchases were made strictly with cash. This concept was successful, and after the opening of another branch in Rostock, the first branch in Berlin (Rosenthaler Stra√üe) was founded in 1885. Wertheim quickly realised the changing demand of the growing city in the period of industrialisation and in 1890 opened the first real department store on Moritzplatz/Oranienstra√üe in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The shop floor was more generous in size and permitted more elaborate presentation of products for sale, products were put on display, and longer runs allowed lower prices. However, it increasingly appeared that the limitations, which arose due to the shops' locations within old housing: the rooms were not especially large and made further expansion scarcely possible. Georg Wertheim furthered his education at the Berlin Art Academy in Sonntagskursen and, with the previously unknown architect Alfred Messel, began to develop the concept of a building designed specifically for the sale of goods. The store was established in Leipzig Street in 1892, and in 1894 began the sale of goods in the first purpose planned and built department store on the Oranienstra√üe. The well-known Wertheim Kaufhaus on Leipziger Platz, which was opened in 1896, went a step further. Wertheim wanted upmarket customers, who until then had held back from patronising his department stores, to have all their needs satisfied under one roof. Because of this the new building on the busiest square of the city was soon opened. In the following years, Messel had to constantly expand the building. The Wertheim store on Leipziger Platz was compared with Harrods in London and the Galeries Lafayette in Paris. Other shopping centres on Rosenthaler Stra√üe (1903), K√∂nigsstra√üe (1911) and, again, on Moritzplatz (1913) followed. The Moritzplatz Wertheim store helped to finance the redirecting of the U-Bahn (Underground) (copying the model of his competitor Rudolph Karstadt) in order that customers could go directly from the underground platform to the entrance. In 1913 the Wertheim empire was the largest German company of its kind. The success soon also aroused envy, and because most shopping complexes like Wertheim were in the hands of Jewish family companies, there were many versatile campaigns against the shopping centres. It was insinuated that they worked with false weightings, provided inferior goods, exploited employees, and demoralised customers. The Wertheim family tried to counter and work against such criticisms with special quality and security provision for their employees. In 1933, the Jewish Wertheim family were forced to \\"Arianise\\" their company, i.e. to surrender their company to an \\"Aryan.\\" On 1 January 1937, Georg Wertheim left the business, but the Wertheim family attempted to avoid losing control of the company by making Georg's wife, Ursula, the principal shareholder since she was considered \\"Aryan\\" under Nazi law. The company was declared as German and renamed as the ‚ÄúAllgemeine Warenhandels-Gesellschaft‚Äù (General Merchandise Trading Business), or AWAG. Georg Wertheim died on 31 December 1939 in Berlin. After the Second World War, Wertheim in 1949 was ousted from the DDR, and in 1951 in West Germany the Hertie-Konzern bought the majority of the shares and continued the business under the Wertheim name. The relatives of the family received some small compensation and relinquished all claims to the shares of the company purchased by Hertie. In 1984, Hertie acquired the rest of the Wertheim stock. For a long time, the shop on the corner of Steglitzer Schlossstrasse and Treischkestrasse was of greatest importance. In the 1960s it was largely expanded, which led to the restructuring of a whole residential quarter (in the direction of Schildhornstrasse). In the following decades a large Karstadt-shopping centre and other shopping centres developed on the Schlossstrasse/Bornstrasse corner next to Kaufhaus Wertheim, where for a long time already had stood Kette Held‚Äôs, later Hertie‚Äôs shops. In 1994 the only remaining Wertheim store on Kurfuerstendamm together with the Hertie business were taken into the possession of the Karstadt company. The descendants of the Wertheim family today live in Germany and the USA, and in 2003 they initiated legal proceedings against the Karstadt company for compensations. The claim for re-transfer of ownership of the parts of the company and premises ousted in the DDR was denied by the courts in 2004. In 2005, an action brought by KarstadtQuelle was dismissed, and eventual compensation was therefore rendered more likely.

It is located along the Cuyahoga River in Northeast Ohio on the western edge of the county. The 2000 census found 5,276 people in the township and 5,527 at the 2010 Census. The township is part of the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland-Akron-Canton Combined Statistical Area. Franklin Township was originally surveyed as Town 3 Range 9 as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve and was purchased by Aaron Olmsted in 1798. It was one of the first civil townships organized in the Western Reserve and initially covered a large area. The township was named by Aaron Olmsted after his son Aaron Franklin Olmsted. It was first settled in 1805 by John Haymaker and its government structure, which consists of three township trustees, was established in 1815. Today Franklin Township is a mostly rural area largely associated with the neighboring city of Kent as the two share a common history, public school district, ZIP code, and fire department. Name and history Standing Rock, located in the Cuyahoga River in what is now northern Kent, was an important landmark for Native American tribes in the area. The area that makes up Franklin Township was originally inhabited by a number of American Indian tribes including the Mound Builders who built a burial mound in the eastern part of the township sometime during the 1st century in what would become Towners Woods Park. Captain Samuel Brady crossed the area around 1780 as part of his campaigns against an unknown tribe, escaping by leaping the Cuyahoga River in present-day downtown Kent and hiding in Brady Lake. In 1796 the area was surveyed by the Connecticut Land Company as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The original survey township was known as Town 3 Range 9 and contained and of land. Aaron Olmsted of East Hartford, Connecticut purchased this township at a cost of 12.5 cents an acre and named it for his son Aaron Franklin Olmsted. Comes from page 24 of the Combination Atlas Map of Portage County by L.H. Everts, published in 1874, which is included as part of the 1978 Atlas It is one of twenty-one Franklin Townships statewide. In 1802, much of the original Trumbull County, which covered the entire Western Reserve, was organized under the name of Franklin Township. The area under the Franklin Township name included all of present-day Portage County and much of present-day Summit County as well as parts of present-day Trumbull County. The following year, the township was surveyed into individual lots. At the formation of Portage County in 1807, Franklin Township included what would become Brimfield, Charlestown, Ravenna, and Rootstown townships.Brown & Norris, p. 195 The first settlers arrived in November 1805 when John Haymaker and his family moved west from Warren to the banks of the Cuyahoga River. They were joined by John's brother George and their father Jacob Haymaker and their families early the next year, and built a gristmill in 1807. Initial growth in the area was slow, but eventually two small villages would develop due to the potential power generated by the Cuyahoga River that could be used in gristmills and manufacturing. The first village, known as Franklin Mills, or locally as the \\"Lower Village\\", developed mostly around the original Haymaker property. In 1818, Joshua Woodard arrived in the area and began constructing buildings just north of the village forming the \\"Upper Village\\" that would come to be known briefly as Carthage.Brown and Norris, p. 435 \\"...the twin settlements were known respectively as \\"Upper Village\\" and \\"Lower Village.\\" The name Carthage was afterward applied to the Upper Village.\\" In the 1820s, Franklin Township was included in the route of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal (P & O Canal). When construction began on the canal in the mid-1830s, land speculation was rampant in many areas of northeast Ohio along the canal, including Franklin Mills. As a result, an industrial and business region was established along the east side of the river in what is now downtown Kent. Factories and mills were either planned or constructed along the Cuyahoga River, some of which either were never built or ultimately failed, due mostly to effects of the Panic of 1837.Grismer, pp. 19‚Äì25 The canal officially opened in 1840, but it would be relatively short-lived, lasting into the 1860s. By 1870 the canal was completely shut down. During this time, what would become the Franklin Township Hall was constructed in 1837 as the intended home of the Franklin Silk Company. The company failed before the building was finished so the township took over the building, finished construction, and began using it for the seat of township government beginning in 1840. In 1851, the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad was built across the northern part of the township with a station at Earlville, a small settlement that once existed along present-day State Route 43 north of Kent. Though the railroad did little in terms of spurring economic development in the township, it would indirectly lead to later economic and population growth. The creation of what would become the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad under the direction of Marvin Kent began that year after Kent was upset by the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad bypassing Franklin Mills. The arrival of the Atlantic and Great Western in the township in 1863 and the establishment of Franklin Mills as the site of the railroad's maintenance yards and shops the next year fueled a new spurt of prolonged economic and population growth in the village, culminating in it being renamed Kent in 1864 and formally incorporating in 1867.Grismer, p. 29Grismer, p. 37 Geography Lake Pippen, located in the eastern part of the township Franklin Township is located in west-central Portage County in Northeast Ohio approximately northeast of Akron and southeast of Cleveland.Grismer, p. 202 It is bordered by Kent on the south and west, Brimfield Township on the south, Stow on the west, Streetsboro and Sugar Bush Knolls to the north, Ravenna Township on the east, and the township completely surrounds the village of Brady Lake. Franklin Township also touches the city of Hudson on the northwest corner, Shalersville Township on the northeast corner, and Rootstown Township on the southeast corner. Within the boundaries of the township is the unincorporated community of Twin Lakes, a residential area on either side of State Route 43 just south of Sugar Bush Knolls. Immediately south of Twin Lakes is the location of the historical town of Earlville which existed primarily in the 19th and early 20th centuries as a stop on the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad. Originally, Franklin Township covered approximately . Most of the city of Kent, all of the village of Brady Lake, and a small part of Sugar Bush Knolls occupy land that was once part of the township. Sugar Bush Knolls withdrew in 1965 and both Kent and Brady Lake formally separated from the township in 1993. Franklin Township is included in the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland-Akron-Elyria Combined Statistical Area. Located on the western end of the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau, the topography of Franklin Township includes rolling hills and varied terrain. Lake Rockwell, the main drinking water source for the city of Akron, is in the northeastern part of the township. It was created in 1913 and impounds water from the Cuyahoga River, covering approximately . In addition to Lake Rockwell, there are seven natural kettle lakes in the township. The largest, Lake Pippen, is owned by the city of Akron as an unused part of the city's water supply. Brady Lake, which is largely within the village limits of Brady Lake, is used for recreation along with East Twin Lake and West Twin Lake, which straddle each side of State Route 43 in the northern part of the township. The United States Geological Survey lists the township's elevation at above sea level at a point inside the Kent city limits near the township's original geographic center. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2000 the township has an area of of which is land and water. =Climate= Franklin Township's climate is classified as a humid continental climate in the Dfa K√∂ppen climate classification meaning it typically has very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters with moderate and variable spring and autumn seasons. During the spring and summer months, thunderstorms are fairly common and the area is susceptible to tornadoes. Effects from tropical systems can also be felt, usually taking the form of increased humidity, rain, and wind, such as with the remnants of Hurricane Ike in September 2008. During the winter months, snowfall is common and can occur in large quantities with considerable cloud cover. Franklin Township is not considered part of the Lake Erie snowbelt, though lake-effect snow does occur at times. The township is in what is referred to as the \\"secondary snowbelt\\", meaning it will receive heavier snowfall totals from lake-effect snow when certain wind directions are more prevalent, but typically sees far less snowfall than areas to the north closer to Lake Erie. While temperatures below the freezing point are typical in the winter months, thaw periods where temperatures exceed and even are not uncommon in January and February. Demographics Initial population growth in Franklin Township was influenced by the location on the Cuyahoga River which led to the development of industrial and manufacturing jobs.Grismer, pp. 11, 25 Early settlers mainly came from the northeastern United States and were largely of German descent.Brown, R.C and Norris, J.E., pp. 658‚Äì716 As of the 2000 Census, there were 5,276 people, 2,174 households, and 1,325 families residing in the township. The population density was 408.8 people per square mile (157.8/km). There were 2,275 housing units at an average density of 176.3/sq mi (109.5/km). The racial makeup of the township was 93.7% White, 2.0% African American, 2.2% Asian, 0.2% Native American, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.3% from other races, and 1.6% from two or more races. 0.7% of the population is Hispanic or Latino of any race. There were 2,174 households, out of which 28.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.6% were married couples living together, 6.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.5% were non-families. 27.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 2.99. In the township the population was spread out, with 21.6% under the age of 18, 14.1% from 18 to 24, 26.6% from 25 to 44, 26.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37.4 years, slightly above both the median age for Ohio (36.2) and the United States (35.3), but significantly above the median age for the city of Kent (22.9). For every 100 females there were 104.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.4 males. The median income for a household in the township was $47,750, and the median income for a family was $64,792. This compared with Ohio's median household income of $40,956 and $41,994 for the United States. Males had a median income of $43,281 versus $27,262 for females. The per capita income for the township was $28,656. About 2.8% of families and 10.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.4% of those under age 18 and 0.5% of those age 65 or over. These are slightly below the levels for both the state and national averages, with 10.6% of individuals in Ohio and 12.4% in the United States being below the poverty line and 7.8% of families in Ohio and 9.2% in the United States. Educationally, like Kent, Franklin Township is above the national, state, and local averages for residents who have attained a bachelor's, master's, or above a master's degree. At the 2000 Census, approximately 42.9% of the township's population above the age of 25 had obtained a college degree compared to 37.1% of Kent's population, 21.0% of the population of Portage County, 21.2% statewide, and 24.4% nationally. Economy The location of Franklin Township along the Cuyahoga River and later the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal and multiple railroad lines made it attractive initially for the establishment of small gristmills and factories. Progressively larger factories would later develop due to increased power potential of the river and later due to the ease and lower cost of transportation of goods to other markets. During the latter half of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the township's largest employers were all industrially based, including the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad and its successors, which operated its main maintenance shops in the village; the Seneca Chain Company; and bus manufacturer Twin Coach among others.Grismer, pp. 168‚Äì185 Changes in the structure of the railroad and declines in the manufacturing sector during the mid-20th century combined with the rapid growth of Kent State University following World War II led to the university becoming Portage County's largest employer and influencing the development of other areas of the township's economy. Kent State University operates Centennial Research Park, along Ohio State Route 59 in the Joint Economic Development District with Kent, which houses two high tech start-up companies in the liquid crystal industry. As of 2000, the educational, health, and social services fields were the township's largest sector, and employed approximately 29% of the workforce. 17.8% is employed in manufacturing, with 13.6% in retail. Arts and entertainment accounts for 7.9% of the workforce with 7.3% in professional and management services. 86.1% of those employed commuted alone to work by way of a car, truck, or van with another 6.8% carpooling. 2.2% of workers walked to work with 0.4% using public transportation. The average commute time was approximately 20 minutes. Government The township is governed by a three- member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following 1 January. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it.

As former sovereign family, later mediatized to Bavaria in 1806 the family belongs to High nobility.  History  Pappenheim originated as a Lordship around 1030, and was raised to a county in 1628. The first member of the House of Pappenheim was Henricus Caput, mentioned in 1111 as vassal of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. From about 1100 until 1806 the Lords and Counts of Pappenheim held the position of hereditary marshals of the Holy Roman Empire, a court office that made them deputies of the Empire's arch marshals, the Electors of Saxony, with certain ceremonial tasks at the Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor. Being immediate to the Emperor, Pappenheim was a member of the Swabian bench of Imperial Counts with one collective vote in the Imperial Diet. Pappenheim was partitioned twice: between itself, Alesheim (Aletzheim), Gr√§fenthal and Treuchtlingen in 1439; and between itself and St√ºhlingen in 1558. Pappenheim absorbed Alesheim in 1697, Gr√§fenthal in 1536, and Treuchtlingen in 1647. Treuchtlingen was purchased in 1447/53 and, after the Treuchtlingen branch went extinct in 1647, became part of the Principality of Ansbach. St√ºhlingen, acquired in 1582, was inherited by F√ºrstenberg in 1639. Pappenheim was mediatised by Bavaria in 1806. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna recognized that Pappenheim should receive compensation for their loss of the hereditary office of Imperial marshal. The former Saar department of the First French Empire was divided five ways, with one of the portions granted to Pappenheim as sovereign territory. Shortly thereafter, the family exchanged title to their land to Prussia for a monetary payment.Treitschke, Heinrich. The History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, Eng. Trans. 1915. Vol. 3, Page 111. Pappenheim was formally recognized by Bavaria as a mediatized house in 1831, after all claims were settled.

Founded in 2003 by Swedish think tank Piratbyr√•n, The Pirate Bay allows visitors to search, download, and contribute magnet links and torrent files, which facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing among users of the BitTorrent protocol. The Pirate Bay has sparked controversies and discussion about legal aspects of file sharing, copyright, and civil liberties and has become a platform for political initiatives against established intellectual property laws as well as a central figure in an anti-copyright movement. The website faced several shutdowns and domain seizures, switching to a series of new web addresses to continue operating. In April 2009, the website's founders (Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, and Gottfrid Svartholm) were found guilty in the Pirate Bay trial in Sweden for assisting in copyright infringement and were sentenced to serve one year in prison and pay a fine. In some countries, Internet service providers (ISPs) have been ordered to block access to the website. Subsequently, proxy websites have been providing access to it. Founders Svartholm, Neij, and Sunde were all released by 2015 after having served shortened sentences.  History  The Pirate Bay was established in September 2003 by the Swedish anti-copyright organisation Piratbyr√•n (The Piracy Bureau); it has been run as a separate organisation since October 2004. The Pirate Bay was first run by Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij, who are known by their nicknames \\"anakata\\" and \\"TiAMO\\", respectively. They have both been accused of \\"assisting in making copyrighted content available\\" by the Motion Picture Association of America. On 31 May 2006, the website's servers in Stockholm were raided and taken away by Swedish police, leading to three days of downtime. The Pirate Bay claims to be a non-profit entity based in the Seychelles; however, this is disputed. The Pirate Bay has been involved in a number of lawsuits, both as plaintiff and as defendant. On 17 April 2009, Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm, and Carl Lundstr√∂m were found guilty of assistance to copyright infringement and sentenced to one year in prison and payment of a fine of 30 million SEK (approximately 4.2m USD, 2.8m GBP, or 3.1m EUR), after a trial of nine days. The defendants appealed the verdict and accused the judge of giving in to political pressure. On 26 November 2010, a Swedish appeals court upheld the verdict, decreasing the original prison terms but increasing the fine to 46 million SEK. On 17 May 2010, because of an injunction against their bandwidth provider, the site was taken offline. Access to the website was later restored with a message making fun of the injunction on their front page. On 23 June 2010, the group Piratbyr√•n disbanded due to the death of Ibi Kopimi Botani, a prominent member and co-founder of the group. The Pirate Bay was hosted for several years by PRQ, a Sweden-based company, owned by creators of TPB Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij. PRQ is said to provide \\"highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services to its customers\\". From May 2011, Serious Tubes Networks started providing network connectivity to The Pirate Bay. On 23 January 2012, The Pirate Bay added the new category Physibles. These are 3D files described as \\"data objects that are able (and feasible) to become physical\\" using a 3D printer. In May 2012, as part of Google's newly inaugurated \\"Transparency Report\\", the company reported over 6,000 formal requests to remove Pirate Bay links from the Google Search index; those requests covered over 80,500 URLs, with the five copyright holders having the most requests consisting of: Froytal Services LLC, Bang Bros, Takedown Piracy LLC, Amateur Teen Kingdom, and International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). On 10 August 2013, The Pirate Bay announced the release of PirateBrowser, a free web browser used to circumvent internet censorship. The site was the most visited torrent directory on the World Wide Web from 2003 until November 2014, when KickassTorrents had more visitors according to Alexa. On 8 December 2014, Google removed most of the Google Play apps from its app store that have \\"The Pirate Bay\\" in the title.Google Joins Piracy Purge, Pro-Pirate Bay Apps Booted From Play Store . Retrieved 9 December 2014. On 9 December 2014, The Pirate Bay was raided by the Swedish police, who seized servers, computers, and other equipment. Several other torrent related sites including EZTV, Zoink, Torrage and the Istole tracker were also shut down in addition to The Pirate Bay's forum Suprbay.org. On the second day after the raid EZTV was reported to be showing \\"signs of life\\" with uploads to ExtraTorrent and KickassTorrents and supporting proxy sites like eztv-proxy.net via the main website's backend IP addresses. Several copies of The Pirate Bay went online during the next several days, most notably oldpiratebay.org, created by isoHunt. On 19 May 2015, the .se domain of The Pirate Bay was ordered to be seized following a ruling by a Swedish court. The site reacted by adding six new domains in its place. The judgment was appealed on 26 May 2015. On 12 May 2016, the appeal was dismissed and the Court ruled the domains be turned over to the Swedish state. The site returned to using its original .org domain in May 2016. In August 2016, the US government shut down KickassTorrents, which resulted in The Pirate Bay becoming once again the most visited BitTorrent website.  Website  = Content = The Pirate Bay allows users to search for Magnet links. These are used to reference resources available for download via peer- to-peer networks which, when opened in a BitTorrent client, begin downloading the desired content. (Originally, The Pirate Bay allowed users to download BitTorrent files (torrents), small files that contain metadata necessary to download the data files from other users). The torrents are organised into categories: \\"Audio\\", \\"Video\\", \\"Applications\\", \\"Games\\", \\"Porn\\" and \\"Other\\". Registration requires an email address and is free; registered users may upload their own torrents and comment on torrents. According to a study of newly uploaded files during 2013 by TorrentFreak, 44% of uploads were television shows and movies, porn was in second place with 35% of uploads, and audio made up 9% of uploads. The website features a browse function that enables users to see what is available in broad categories like Audio, Video, and Games, as well as sub-categories like Audio books, High-res Movies, and Comics. Since January 2012, it also features a \\"Physibles\\" category for 3D-printable objects. The contents of these categories can be sorted by file name, the number of seeders or leechers, the date posted, etc. Piratbyr√•n described The Pirate Bay as a long-running project of performance art. Normally, the front page of The Pirate Bay featured a drawing of a pirate ship with the logo of the 1980s anti-copyright infringement campaign, \\"Home Taping Is Killing Music\\", on its sails instead of the Jolly Roger symbol usually associated with pirate ships. = Technical details = Initially, The Pirate Bay's four Linux servers ran a custom web server called Hypercube. An old version is open-source. On 1 June 2005, The Pirate Bay updated its website in an effort to reduce bandwidth usage, which was reported to be at 2 HTTP requests per millisecond on each of the four web servers, as well as to create a more user friendly interface for the front-end of the website. The website now runs Lighttpd and PHP on its dynamic front ends, MySQL at the database back end, Sphinx on the two search systems, memcached for caching SQL queries and PHP-sessions and Varnish in front of Lighttpd for caching static content. , The Pirate Bay consisted of 31 dedicated servers including nine dynamic web fronts, a database, two search engines, and eight BitTorrent trackers. On 7 December 2007, The Pirate Bay finished the move from Hypercube to Opentracker as its BitTorrent tracking software, also enabling the use of the UDP tracker protocol for which Hypercube lacked support. This allowed UDP multicast to be used to synchronise the multiple servers with each other much faster than before. Opentracker is free software. Original undated. Opentracker is released under a beerware license. In June 2008, The Pirate Bay announced that their servers would support SSL encryption in response to Sweden's new wiretapping law. On 19 January 2009, The Pirate Bay launched IPv6 support for their tracker system, using an IPv6-only version of Opentracker. On 17 November 2009, The Pirate Bay shut off its tracker service permanently, stating that centralised trackers are no longer needed since distributed hash tables (DHT), peer exchange (PEX), and magnet links allow peers to find each other and content in a decentralised way. On 20 February 2012, The Pirate Bay announced in a Facebook post that after 29 February the site would no longer offer torrent files, and would instead offer only magnet links. The site commented: \\"Not having torrents will be a bit cheaper for us but it will also make it harder for our common enemies to stop us.\\" The site added that torrents being shared by fewer than ten people will retain their torrent files, to ensure compatibility with older software that may not support magnet links.  Funding  = Early financing = In April 2007, a rumour was confirmed on the Swedish talk show Bert that The Pirate Bay had received financial support from right-wing entrepreneur Carl Lundstr√∂m. This caused some consternation since Lundstr√∂m, an heir to the Wasabr√∂d fortune, is known for financing several far-right political parties and movements like Sverigedemokraterna and Bevara Sverige Svenskt (Keep Sweden Swedish). During the talk show, Piratbyr√•n spokesman Tobias Andersson acknowledged that \\"without Lundstr√∂m's support, Pirate Bay would not have been able to start\\" and stated that most of the money went towards acquiring servers and bandwidth. (English tr.) =Donations= From 2004 until 2006, The Pirate Bay had a \\"Donate\\" link to a donations page which listed several payment methods, stated that funds supported only the tracker, and offered time-limited benefits to donors such as no advertisements and \\"VIP\\" status. After that, the link was removed from the home page, and the donations page only recommended donating \\"to your local pro-piracy group\\" for a time, after which it redirected to the site's main page. Billboard claimed that the site in 2009 \\"appeals for donations to keep its service running\\". In 2006, Petter Nilsson, a candidate on the Swedish political reality show Toppkandidaterna (The Top Candidates), donated 35,000 SEK (US$4,925.83) to The Pirate Bay, which they used to buy new servers. In 2007, the site ran a fund intended to buy Sealand, a platform with debated micronation status. In 2009, the convicted principals of TPB requested that users stop trying to donate money for their fines, because they refused to pay them. In 2013, The Pirate Bay published its Bitcoin address on the site front page for donations, as well as Litecoin. homepage. = Merchandising = The site links to an online store selling site-related merchandise, first noted in 2006 in Svenska Dagbladet. = Advertising = Since 2006, the website has received financing through advertisements on result pages. According to speculations by Svenska Dagbladet, the advertisements generate about 600,000 SEK (US$84,000) per month. (English tr.) In an investigation in 2006, the police concluded that The Pirate Bay brings in 1.2 million SEK (US$169,000) per year from advertisements.(English tr.) The prosecution estimated in the 2009 trial from emails and screenshots that the advertisements pay over 10 million SEK (US$1.4M) a year,(English tr.) but the indictment used the estimate from the police investigation.(English tr.) The lawyers of the site's administrators counted the 2006 revenue closer to 725,000 SEK (US$102,000). (English tr.) The verdict of the first trial, however, quoted the estimate from the preliminary investigation. , IFPI claims that the website is extremely profitable, and that The Pirate Bay is more engaged in making profit than supporting people's rights. The website has insisted that these allegations are not true, stating, \\"It's not free to operate a Web Site on this scale\\", and, \\"If we were making lots of money I, Svartholm, wouldn't be working late at the office tonight, I'd be sitting on a beach somewhere, working on my tan.\\" In response to claims of annual revenue exceeding US$3 million made by the IFPI, the site's spokesman Peter Sunde argues that the website's high bandwidth, power, and hardware costs eliminate the potential for profit. The Pirate Bay, he says, may ultimately be operating at a loss. In the 2009 trial, the defence estimated the site's yearly expenses to be 800,000 SEK (US$110,000). There have been unintentional advertisers. In 2007, an online ad agency placed Wal-Mart The Simpsons DVD ads \\"along with search results that included downloads of the series\\". In 2012, banner ads for Canada's Department of Finance Economic Action Plan were placed atop search results, as part of a larger \\"media buy\\", but were pulled \\"quickly\\". = Fee = According to the site's usage policy, it reserves the right to charge commercial policy violators \\"a basic fee of ‚Ç¨5,000 plus bandwidth and other costs that may arise due to the violation\\". Co-founder Peter Sunde accused Swedish book publishers, who scraped the site for information about copyrighted books, of violating the usage policy, and asserted TPB's copyright on its database.  Projects  \\"Jubilee!\\" ‚Äì on the homepage 31 January 2008 thepiratebay.org, 31 January 2008. \\"10 million peers. 1 million torrents. 2.5 million registered users. 100 blog entries. Jubilee!\\" The team behind The Pirate Bay has worked on several websites and software projects of varying degrees of permanence. In 2007, BayImg, an image hosting website similar to TinyPic went online in June. (English tr.) Pre-publication images posted to BayImg became part of a legal battle when Conde Nast's network was later allegedly hacked. In July, \\"within hours after Ingmar Bergman's death\\", BergmanBits.com was launched, listing torrents for the director's films, online until mid-2008. In August, The Pirate Bay relaunched the BitTorrent website Suprnova.org to perform the same functions as The Pirate Bay, with different torrent trackers, but the site languished; the domain was returned to its original owner in August 2010, and it now redirects to TorrentFreak.tv.. TorrentFreak. 4 August 2010. Retrieved 10 August 2010. Suprbay.org was introduced in August as the official forum for ThePirateBay.org and the various sites connected to it. Users can request reseeding of torrents, or report malware within torrent files or illegal material on ThePirateBay.org. Announcement of blog. BOiNK was announced in October in response to the raid on Oink's Pink Palace, a music-oriented BitTorrent website. A month later Sunde cancelled BOiNK, citing the many new music websites created since the downfall of OiNK. A Mac dashboard widget was released in December, listing \\"top 10 stuff currently on TPB, either per category or the full list\\". SlopsBox, a disposable email address anti-spam service, also appeared in December, and was reviewed in 2009. (English tr.) Slopsbox is offline. Political cartoon criticising the entertainment industry on the main page of TPB In 2008, Baywords was launched as a free blogging service that lets users of the site blog about anything as long as it does not break any Swedish laws. In December, The Pirate Bay resurrected ShareReactor as a combined eD2k and BitTorrent site. The same month, the Vio mobile video converter was released, designed to convert video files for playback on mobile devices such as iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, many Nokia and Windows Mobile devices. In 2009, Pastebay, a note sharing service similar to Pastebin, was made available to the public as of 23 March. First mention. The Video Bay video streaming/sharing site was announced in June to be \\"The YouTube Killer\\", with content viewable in HTML 5-capable browsers. The site was in an \\"Extreme Beta\\" phase; a message on the homepage instructed the user \\"don't expect anything to work at all\\". The Video Bay was never completed and as of 28 April 2013, The Video Bay is inaccessible. A contest by Project Chanology advertised at The Pirate Bay in December 2009 On 18 April 2011, Pirate Bay temporarily changed its name to \\"Research Bay\\", collaborating with P2P researchers of the Lund University Cybernorms group in a large poll of P2P users. The researchers published their results online on \\"The Survey Bay\\", as a public Creative Commons project in 2013. In January 2012, the site announced The Promo Bay; \\"doodles\\" by selected musicians, artists and others could be rotated onto the site's front page at a future date. Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho was promoted, offering a collection of his books for free download. By November, 10,000 artists were reported to have signed up. TPB preserves a dated collection of exhibited logos. image collection. The Pirate Bay. On 2 December 2012, some ISPs in the UK such as BT, Virgin Media, and BE started blocking The Promo Bay but stopped a few days later when the BPI reversed its position. = Purchases = In January 2007, when the micronation of Sealand was put up for sale, the ACFI and The Pirate Bay tried to buy it. The Sealand government, however, did not want to be involved with The Pirate Bay, as it was their opinion that file sharing represented \\"theft of proprietary rights\\". A new plan was formed to buy an island instead, but this too was never implemented, despite the website having raised US$25,000 (‚Ç¨15,000) in donations for this cause. The P2P news blog TorrentFreak reported on 12 October 2007 that the Internet domain ifpi.com, which previously belonged to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, an anti-piracy organisation, had been acquired by The Pirate Bay. When asked about how they got hold of the domain, Sunde told TorrentFreak, \\"It's not a hack, someone just gave us the domain name. We have no idea how they got it, but it's ours and we're keeping it.\\" The website was renamed \\"The International Federation of Pirates Interests\\" However, the IFPI filed a complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization shortly thereafter, which subsequently ordered The Pirate Bay to return the domain name to the IFPI.  Incidents  = May 2006 raid = On 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay and people involved with the website took place as ordered by judge Tomas Norstr√∂m, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations. Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's Internet service provider, PRQ. The company is owned by two operators of The Pirate Bay. Three peopleGottfrid Svartholm, Mikael Viborg, and Fredrik Neijwere held by the police for questioning, but were released later that evening. All servers in the room were seized, including those running the website of Piratbyr√•n, an independent organisation fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities. Equipment such as hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and fax machines were also seized. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) wrote in a press release: \\"Since filing a criminal complaint in Sweden in November 2004, the film industry has worked vigorously with Swedish and U.S. government officials in Sweden to shut this illegal website down.\\" MPAA CEO Dan Glickman also stated, \\"Intellectual property theft is a problem for film industries all over the world and we are glad that the local government in Sweden has helped stop The Pirate Bay from continuing to enable rampant copyright theft on the Internet.\\" The MPAA press release set forth its justification for the raid and claimed that there were three arrests; however, the individuals were not actually arrested, only held for questioning. The release also reprinted John G. Malcolm's allegation that The Pirate Bay was making money from the distribution of copyrighted material, a criticism denied by the Pirate Bay. After the raid, The Pirate Bay displayed a message that confirmed that the Swedish police had executed search warrants for breach of copyright law or assisting such a breach. The closure message initially caused some confusion because on 1 April 2005, April Fools' Day, The Pirate Bay had posted a similar message as a prank, stating that they were unavailable due to a raid by the Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau and IFPI. Piratbyr√•n set up a temporary news blog to inform the public about the incident. (English tr.) On 2 June 2006, The Pirate Bay was available once again, with their logo depicting a pirate ship firing cannonballs at the Hollywood Sign.The Pirate Bay has servers in both Belgium and Russia for future use in case of another raid. According to The Pirate Bay, in the two years following the raid, it grew from 1 million to 2.7 million registered users and from 2.5 million to 12 million peers. The Pirate Bay now claims over 5 million active users. Sweden's largest technology museum, the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology, acquired one of the confiscated servers in 2009 and exhibited it for having great symbolic value as a \\"big problem or a big opportunity\\".The Pirate Bays server p√• Tekniska museet (in Swedish). Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology, February 2009. = Autopsy photos = In September 2008, the Swedish media reported that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed. The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later. On 11 September 2008, the website's press contact Peter Sunde participated in the debate program Debatt on the public broadcaster SVT. Sunde had agreed to participate on the condition that the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT. This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day. \\"I don't think it's our job to judge if something is ethical or unethical or what other people want to put out on the internet\\", said The Pirate Bay's spokesperson Peter Sunde to TV4. = Legal issues = In September 2007, a large number of internal emails were leaked from anti-piracy company MediaDefender by an anonymous hacker. Some of the leaked emails discussed hiring hackers to perform DDoS attacks on The Pirate Bay's servers and trackers. In response to the leak, The Pirate Bay filed charges in Sweden against MediaDefender clients Twentieth Century Fox Sweden AB, EMI Sweden AB, Universal Music Group Sweden AB, Universal Pictures Nordic AB, Paramount Home Entertainment (Sweden) AB, Atari Nordic AB, Activision Nordic, Ubisoft Sweden AB, Sony BMG Music Entertainment (Sweden) AB, and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Nordic AB, but the charges were not pursued. MediaDefender's stocks fell sharply after this incident, and several media companies withdrew from the service after the company announced the leak had caused $825,000 in losses. Later, The Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde accused police investigator Jim Keyzer of a conflict of interest when he declined to investigate MediaDefender. Keyzer later accepted a job for MPAA member studio Warner Brothers. (English tr.) The leaked emails revealed that other MPAA member studios hired MediaDefender to pollute The Pirate Bay's torrent database. In an official letter to the Swedish Minister of Justice, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested assistance from the Swedish government to prevent The Pirate bay distributing video clips from the Beijing Olympics. The IOC claimed there were more than one million downloads of footage from the Olympics ‚Äì mostly of the opening ceremony. The Pirate Bay, however, did not take anything down, and temporarily renamed the website to The Beijing Bay. the trial The trial against the men behind the Pirate Bay started in Sweden on 16 February 2009. They were accused of breaking Swedish copyright law.. BBC News, 16 February 2009. The defendants, however, continued to be confident about the outcome. Half the charges against the Pirate Bay were dropped on the second day of the trial. The three operators of the site and their one investor Carl Lundstr√∂m were convicted in Stockholm district court on 17 April 2009 and sentenced to one year in jail each and a total of 30 million SEK (US$3.6 million, 2.7 million EUR, 2.4 million GBP) in fines and damages. The defendants' lawyers appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal and requested a retrial in the district court, alleging bias on the part of judge Tomas Norstr√∂m. On 13 May 2009, several record companies again sued Neij, Svartholm, Sunde and also The Pirate Bay's main internet service provider Black Internet. They required enforcement for ending The Pirate Bay's accessory to copyright infringement that had not stopped despite the court order in April, and in the complaint listed several pages of works being shared with the help of the site. The suit was joined by several major film companies on 30 July. The Stockholm district court ruled on 21 August that Black Internet must stop making available the specific works mentioned in the judgment, or face a 500,000 SEK fine.Ruling in case number T 7540-09 and T 11712-09(PDF). (Swedish) Stockholm district court. 21 August 2009. The company was notified of the order on 24 August, and they complied with it on the same day by disconnecting The Pirate Bay. Computer Sweden noted that the judgment did not order The Pirate Bay to be disconnected, but the ISP had no other option for stopping the activity on the site. It was the first time in Sweden for an ISP to be forced to stop providing access for a website. A public support fund fronted by the CEO of the ISP was set up to cover the legal fees of an appeal. Pirate Party leader Rickard Falkvinge submitted the case for Parliamentary Ombudsman review, criticising the court's order to make intermediaries responsible for relayed content and to assign active crime prevention tasks to a private party. On 28 October 2009, the Stockholm District Court ordered a temporary injunction on Neij and Svartholm with a penalty of 500,000 SEK each, forbidding them from participating in the operation of The Pirate Bay's website or trackers.Ruling in case number T 7540-09 and T 11712-09.(PDF). (Swedish) Stockholm district court. 28 October 2009. On 21 May 2010, the Svea Court of Appeal decided not to change the orders on Black Internet or Neij and Svartholm. On 1 February 2012, the Supreme Court of Sweden refused to hear an appeal in the conviction case, and agreed with the decision of the Svea Court of Appeal, which had upheld the sentences in November 2011. On 2 September 2012, Pirate Bay co-founder Gottfrid Svartholm Warg was arrested in Cambodia. He was detained in Phnom Penh by officers executing an international warrant issued against him in April after he did not turn up to serve a one-year jail sentence for copyright violations. On 24 December 2012, administrators of TPB changed the homepage to urge users to send Warg, in jail, \\"gifts and letters\\". (Via Webcitation.org and TinyPic.com.) In March 2013, The Pirate Bay claimed in a blog post that it had moved its servers to North Korea. The incident turned out to be a hoax. In April 2013, within a week The Pirate Bay had moved its servers from Greenland to Iceland to St. Martin, either in response to legal threats or preemptively. In December 2013, the site changed its domain to .ac (Ascension Island), following the seizure of the .sx domain. On 12 December, the site moved to .pe (Peru), on 18 December to .gy (Guyana). Following the site's suspension from the .gy domain, on 19 December The Pirate Bay returned to .se (Sweden), which it had previously occupied between February 2012 and April 2013. = Trial = The Pirate Bay trial was a joint criminal and civil prosecution in Sweden of four individuals charged for promoting the copyright infringement of others with The Pirate Bay site. The criminal charges were supported by a consortium of intellectual rights holders led by IFPI, who filed individual civil compensation claims against the owners of The Pirate Bay. Swedish prosecutors filed charges on 31 January 2008 against Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm, and Peter Sunde; and Carl Lundstr√∂m, a Swedish businessman who through his businesses sold services to the site. The prosecutor claimed the four worked together to administer, host, and develop the site and thereby facilitated other people's breach of copyright law. Some 34 cases of copyright infringements were originally listed, of which 21 were related to music files, 9 to movies, and 4 to games. One case involving music files was later dropped by the copyright holder who made the file available again on The Pirate Bay site. In addition, claims for damages of 117 million kronor (US$13 million, ‚Ç¨12.5 million) were filed. The case was decided jointly by a judge and three appointed lay judges. According to Swedish media, the lead judge was involved in one pro-copyright organisation, and on the board of another, but denied that his involvement constituted a conflict of interest. The trial started on 16 February 2009, in the district court (tingsr√§tt) of Stockholm, Sweden. The hearings ended on 3 March 2009 and the verdict was announced at 11:00 am on Friday 17 April 2009: Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm and Carl Lundstr√∂m were all found guilty and sentenced to serve one year in prison and pay a fine of 30 million Swedish krona (app. ‚Ç¨2.7 million or US$3.5 million). All of the defendants appealed the verdict. The appeal trial concluded on 15 October 2010, and the verdict was announced on 26 November. The appeal court shortened sentences of three of the defendants who appeared in court that day. Neij's sentence was reduced to 10 months, Sunde's to eight, and Lundstr√∂m's to four. However, the fine was increased from 32 to 46 million kronor. On 1 February 2012, the Supreme Court of Sweden refused to hear an appeal in the case, prompting the site to change its official domain name to thepiratebay.se from thepiratebay.org. The move to a .se domain was claimed to prevent susceptibility to US laws from taking control of the site. On 9 April 2013, the site changed its domain name to thepiratebay.gl, under the Greenland TLD, in anticipation of possible seizure by Swedish authorities of its .se domain. The change proved to be short lived, as the site returned to the .se domain on 12 April 2013 after being blocked on the .gl domain by Tele-Post, which administers domains in Greenland. Tele-Post cited a Danish court ruling that the site was in violation of copyright laws. Founders Svartholm, Neij, and Sunde were all released after having finished serving their sentences by 2015. = Service issues = In May 2007, The Pirate Bay was attacked by a group of hackers. They copied the user database, which included over 1.5 million users. The Pirate Bay claimed to its users that the data was of no value and that passwords and e-mails were encrypted and hashed. Some blogs stated that a group known as the AUH (Arga Unga Hackare, Swedish for \\"Angry Young Hackers\\") were suspected of executing the attack; however, the AUH stated on the Computer Sweden newspaper that they were not involved and would take revenge on those responsible for the attack. On 27 April 2009, the website of The Pirate Bay had fibre IPv4 connectivity issues. There was widespread speculation this was a forced outage from the Swedish anti-piracy group, accelerated somewhat by TPB adding contact details for the Swedish anti-piracy group's lawyers to its RIPE database record. The site and its forums were still available via IPv6 at the time. On 24 August 2009, one of The Pirate Bay's upstream providers was ordered to discontinue service for the website by a Swedish court in response to a civil action brought by several entertainment companies including Disney, Universal, Time Warner, Columbia, Sony, NBC, and Paramount. According to the TPB Blog, this caused a downtime of 3 hours; however, some users were unable to access the site immediately following the relocation due to unrelated technical difficulties. The site was fully operational again for everyone within 24 hours. On 6 October 2009, one of the IP transit providers to The Pirate Bay blocked all Pirate Bay traffic causing an outage for most users around the world. The same day, the site was reportedly back online at an IP address at CyberBunker, located in the Netherlands. It is not known whether The Pirate Bay is actually located at CyberBunker or whether they are using the CyberBunker service that routes CyberBunker IP addresses to any datacenter around the world. These routes are not visible to the outside world. CyberBunker was given a court injunction on 17 May 2010, taking the site offline briefly; later that day, hosting was restored by Sweden's Pirate Party.English tr. Former spokesman for the Pirate Bay, Peter Sunde, commented that it would now be very difficult to stop the site because it would now be seen as political censorship if anyone tries to shut it down. (English tr.). On 8 July 2010, a group of Argentine hackers gained access to The Pirate Bay's administration panel through a security breach via the backend of The Pirate Bay website. They were able to delete torrents and expose users' IP-addresses, emails and MD5-hashed passwords. The Pirate Bay was taken offline for upgrades. Users visiting the website were met by the following message: \\"Upgrading some stuff, database is in use for backups, soon back again. Btw, it's nice weather outside I think.\\". TorrentFreak. 8 July 2010.Mick, Jason (8 July 2010). . DailyTech.com. Retrieved 8 July 2010.As of 22:20 (UTC), 8 July 2010 the site is up. On 16 May 2012, The Pirate Bay experienced a major DDoS attack, causing the site to be largely inaccessible worldwide for around 24 hours. The Pirate Bay said that it did not know who was behind the attack, although it \\"had its suspicions\\". On 5 May 2015, The Pirate Bay went offline for several hours, apparently as a result of not properly configuring its SSL certificate. = Acquisition discussion = On 30 June 2009, Swedish advertising company Global Gaming Factory X AB announced their intention to buy the site for SEK 60 million (approximately US$8.5 million) (30m SEK in cash, 30m SEK in GGF shares). The Pirate Bay founders stated that the profits from the sale would be placed in an offshore account where it would be used to fund projects pertaining to \\"freedom of speech, freedom of information, and the openness of the Internet\\".Acquisitions of The Pirate Bay and new file sharing technology, P2P 2.0(PDF). Press release. Global Gaming Factory.. Reuters, 30 June 2009. Assurances were made that \\"no personal data will be transferred in the eventual sale (since no personal data is kept).\\" Global Gaming Chief Executive Hans Pandeya commented on the site's future by saying \\"We would like to introduce models which entail that content providers and copyright owners get paid for content that is downloaded via the site\\", and announced that users would be charged a monthly fee for access to The Pirate Bay. Global Gaming Factory's letter of intent expired at the end of September 2009, without the transaction having taken place. This may be due to the company's financial difficulties. \\"PC World\\" magazine regarded the deal's future as \\"doomed\\". = December 2014 raid = The Hydra Bay logo; occasionally displayed on the official website On 9 December 2014, police in Stockholm raided the company's premises and seized servers and other computers and equipment, which resulted in the website going offline. The raid was in response to a complaint from Rights Alliance, a Swedish anti-piracy group. The Pirate Bay was one of many peer-to-peer and torrent-related websites and apps that went down. One member of the crew was arrested. TorrentFreak reported that most other torrent sites reported a 5‚Äì10% increase in traffic from the displaced users, though the shutdown had little effect on overall piracy levels. In retaliation to the raid, a group of hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous allegedly leaked email log-in details of Swedish government officials. The Pirate Bay co- founder Peter Sunde commented in a blog post that he was happy to see the website shut down, believing his successors have done nothing to improve the site, criticising in particular the increased use of advertisements. IsoHunt has since copied much of the original TPB database and made it accessible through oldpiratebay.org, a searchable index of old Pirate Bay torrents. IsoHunt also released a tool called The Open Bay, to allow users to deploy their own version of the Pirate Bay website. The tool is responsible for around 372 mirror sites. Since 17 December 2014, The Pirate Bay's Facebook page has been unavailable. On 22 December 2014, a website was resumed at the domain thepiratebay.se, showing a flip clock with the length of time in days and hours that the site had been offline, and a waving pirate flag. From this day TPB was hosted for a period in Moldova, on Trabia Network (Moldo-German company) servers. The Pirate Bay then began using the services of CloudFlare, a company which offers reverse proxy services.Trabia anun»õƒÉ cƒÉ The Pirate Bay nu mai este gƒÉzduit √Æn Moldova, dar IP-ul aratƒÉ altceva.

The website returned with a prominent phoenix logo displayed at the domain thepiratebay.se on 31 January 2015. = Error 522 downtimes = Beginning in October 2018, the clearnet Pirate Bay website started to be inaccessible in some locations around the world, showing Error 522. As the result, direct visits to the website dropped by more than 32 percent in October. The incident was found to be unrelated to internet provider blocking or domain name problem, but the exact cause has not been determined. The site's Tor domain and proxies remained unaffected. The Error 522 problem occurred again in early March 2020, with the site's admins unable to say when it would be resolved. After one month, the site's functionality was restored with an update of the domain records and the Cloudflare nameservers.  Censorship and controversies  =Anti-copyright movement= The Pirate Bay has sparked controversies and discussion about legal aspects of file sharing, copyright, and civil liberties and has become a platform for political initiatives against established intellectual property laws and a central figure in an anti-copyright movement.Jessica L. Beyer. Expect Us: Online Communities and Political Mobilization. Page 65. Oxford University Press. 3 July 2014. . The website faced several shutdowns and domain seizures which \\"did little to take the site offline, as it simply switched to a series of new web addresses and continued to operate\\". = Domain blocking by countries = The Pirate Bay's website has been blocked in some countries, despite the relative ease by which such blocks can be circumvented in most countries. While the URL to the Pirate Bay itself has been blocked in these countries, numerous mirror websites emerged to make the website available at different URLs, routing traffic around the block. According to Google chairman Eric Schmidt, \\"government plans to block access to illicit filesharing websites could set a 'disastrous precedent' for freedom of speech\\"; he also expressed that Google would \\"fight attempts to restrict access to sites such as the Pirate Bay\\".  Sweden  On 13 February 2017, Sweden's Patent and Market Court of Appeal decided that the broadband provider Bredbandsbolaget must block its customers from accessing file sharing site The Pirate Bay, overruling a district court ruling to the contrary from 2015. This is the first time a site was openly blocked in Sweden. The rest of the ISPs are expected to follow the same court orders. = Censorship by corporations =  Facebook  After The Pirate Bay introduced a feature in March 2009 to easily share links to torrents on the social networking site Facebook, Wired.com found in May that Facebook had started blocking the links. On further inspection, they discovered that all messages containing links to The Pirate Bay in both public and in private messages, regardless of content, were being blocked. Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyers commented that Facebook might be working against the US Electronic Communications Privacy Act by intercepting user messages, but Facebook chief privacy officer Chris Kelly said that they have the right to use blocks on links where there is a \\"demonstrated disregard for intellectual property rights\\", following users' agreement on their terms of service. Links to other similar sites have not been blocked.  Microsoft  In March 2012, Microsoft blocked Windows Live Messenger messages if they contain links to The Pirate Bay. When a user sends an instant message that contains a link to The Pirate Bay, Windows Live Messenger prompts a warning and claims \\"Blocked as it was reported unsafe\\". \\"We block instant messages if they contain malicious or spam URLs based on intelligence algorithms, third-party sources, and/or user complaints. Pirate Bay URLs were flagged by one or more of these and were consequently blocked\\", Microsoft told The Register in an emailed statement.  In media  The Pirate Bay is featured in Steal This Film (2006), a documentary series about society and filesharing, produced by The League of Noble Peers; in the Danish Documentary Good Copy Bad Copy, which explores the issues surrounding file copyright; and the documentary TPB AFK.

On the Media, NPR. Interview with Daniel Roth. Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus, former member of the Swedish pop music group ABBA, criticised copyright infringing activities of The Pirate Bay supporters as \\"lazy and mean\\". In contrast, Brazilian best- selling author Paulo Coelho has embraced free sharing online. Coelho supports The Pirate Bay and offered to be a witness in the 2009 trial. He accounts much of his growing sales to his work shared on the Internet and comments that \\"a person who does not share is not only selfish, but bitter and alone\\".

Early life and education Christina Crawford was born in Los Angeles, California in 1939, to unmarried teens. According to her personal interview with Larry King, her father was married to another woman and supposedly in the Navy; her mother was unmarried. Crawford was adopted from a baby broker in Nevada because Joan was formally denied an adoption by social services for being an unfit candidate in California in 1940. Christina maintains that Joan did not have a positive relationship with either her own mother, Anna, or with her brother Hal, which contributed to social services' conclusion as well as Joan's multiple divorces. Crawford was one of five children adopted by Joan. Her siblings were Christopher (1942‚Äì2006), adopted in 1943, and twin girls ‚Äî Catherine (Cathy, 1947‚Äì2020) and Cynthia (Cindy, 1947‚Äì2007) ‚Äî adopted in 1947. Another boy, also named Christopher, was adopted in 1941 but was reclaimed by his birth mother. During Episode 2008 of a PBS Broadcast of Antiques Roadshow that first aired on February 23, 2019, a \\"Joan Crawford\\" archive was evaluated. The owner of the estate items stated that he was the grandson of a lady that was employed by Joan Crawford and had served as a nanny. The estate items included a set of instructions that were described as having been typed by Joan Crawford, and that instructed the nanny to \\"tie\\" one of the children (Christopher) to their highchair during the children's morning schedule. Crawford has stated that her childhood was affected by her adoptive mother's alcoholism. At 10, Crawford was sent to Chadwick School in Palos Verdes, California, which many other celebrity children attended. However, her mother sent her from Chadwick to graduate from Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy in La Ca√±ada (now the city of La Ca√±ada Flintridge), California, and curtailed Crawford's outside contact until her graduation. After graduating from Flintridge, she moved from California to Pittsburgh to attend Carnegie Mellon School of Drama and then to New York City, where she studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse in Manhattan. After seven years, she gained a Bachelor of Arts degree from UCLA. After 14 years as an actress, Crawford returned to college, graduating magna cum laude from UCLA and receiving her master's degree from the Annenberg School of Communication at USC. Then she worked in corporate communications at the Los Angeles headquarters of Getty Oil Company. Personal life Crawford met Harvey Medlinsky, a director and Broadway stage manager, while she was appearing in the Chicago national company of Barefoot in the Park. They were married briefly. She met her second husband, commercial producer David Koontz, while she was working on a car commercial. She has no children. Career Crawford appeared in summer stock theatre, including a production of Splendor in the Grass. She also acted in a number of Off-Broadway productions, including In Color on Sundays (1958). She also appeared in At Chrismastime (1959) and Dark of the Moon (1959) at the Fred Miller Theater in Milwaukee, and The Moon Is Blue (1960). In 1960, Crawford accepted a role in the film Force of Impulse, which was released in 1961. Also in 1961, Crawford appeared in a small role in Wild in the Country, a film starring Elvis Presley. That year, she made a guest appearance on Dean Miller's NBC celebrity interview program Here's Hollywood, promoting the films. In 1962, she appeared in the play The Complaisant Lover. She played five character parts in Ben Hecht's controversial play Winkelberg. The same year, she appeared on the CBS courtroom drama The Verdict is Yours. In October 1965, she appeared in Neil Simon's Barefoot in the Park, with Myrna Loy, a friend of her mother. She also had a role in Faces (1968). Crawford played Joan Borman Kane on the soap opera The Secret Storm in New York from 1968 until 1969. While Crawford was in the hospital recovering from an emergency operation in October 1968, Joan, then over 60 years old, asked for the role of the 28-year-old character. She did so without mentioning it to her daughter, and under the guise of \\"holding the role\\" for Crawford so that the part would not be recast during her absence, she appeared in four episodes. Viewers increased 40% during this replacement time, and Crawford, already feeling betrayed, also felt embarrassed by her mother's seemingly intoxicated performance. Eventually let go from the series, Crawford believed her mother's interference had contributed to her departure. The producers, however, said that the character and her storyline had simply run its course. Crawford also made guest appearances on other TV programs, including Medical Center, Marcus Welby, M.D., Matt Lincoln, Ironside and The Sixth Sense. =Later career= After Joan Crawford died in 1977, Crawford and her brother, Christopher, discovered that their mother had disinherited them from her $2 million estate, her will citing \\"reasons which are well-known to them.\\" In November 1977, Crawford and her brother sued to invalidate their mother's will, which she signed on October 18, 1976. Cathy LaLonde, another Crawford daughter, and her husband, Jerome, the complaint charged, \\"took deliberate advantage of decedent's seclusion and weakened and distorted mental and physical condition to insinuate themselves\\" into Joan's favor.Los Angeles Times, November 19, 1977 A court settlement was reached on July 13, 1979, awarding Crawford and Christopher $55,000 from their mother's estate. In 1978, Crawford's book Mommie Dearest was released. The book accused her mother of being a cruel, violent, neglectful, and deceitful narcissistic fraud who adopted her children only for wealth and fame after she had been labeled \\"box office poison\\" after being fired from MGM studios In 1981, a movie adaptation of the book was released, starring Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford, Mara Hobel (Mara Boyd) as very young Christina, and Diana Scarwid as adult Christina Crawford. The film, while critically panned, grossed more than $39 million worldwide from a $5 million budget and garnered five Golden Raspberry Awards, including worst picture. Crawford has published five subsequent books, including Survivor. After a near-fatal stroke in 1981, she spent five years in rehabilitation before moving to the Northwest. She ran a bed and breakfast called Seven Springs Farms in Tensed, Idaho, between 1994 and 1999. She formed Seven Springs Press in 1998 to self-publish the 20th-anniversary edition of Mommie Dearest in paperback from the original manuscript and included new material about the years after her graduation from high school. In 2000, Crawford began working as entertainment manager at the Coeur d'Alene Casino in Idaho, where she worked until 2007. She then wrote and produced a regional TV series, Northwest Entertainment. On November 22, 2009, she was appointed county commissioner in Benewah County, Idaho, by Governor Butch Otter, but she lost her bid for election in November 2010. In 2011, Crawford founded the non- profit Benewah Human Rights Coalition and served as the organization's first president. In 2013, she made a documentary, Surviving Mommie Dearest. On November 21, 2017, the e-book editions of Mommie Dearest, Survivor, and Daughters of the Inquisition were published through Open Road Integrated Media. She is also currently working with composer David Nehls on a stage musical adaptation of Mommie Dearest, to be produced in regional theater. Crawford is currently writing the third book in her memoir trilogy, following Mommie Dearest and Survivor.

A capital levy is a tax on capital rather than income, collected once, rather than repeatedly (regular collection would make it a wealth tax). For example, a capital levy of 30% will see an individual or business with a net worth of $100,000 pay a one-off sum of $30,000, regardless of income. Capital levies are considered difficult for a government to implement. Some economists argue that capital levies are a disincentive to savings and investment, and cause capital flight, but others argue that in theory this need not be the case. The latter view was popular in the World Wars; in the 2010s, it has also gained some acceptance as more heavily indebted nations struggle to raise revenues. Examples of capital levies = Ancient democracies = In ancient Athens during its democracy, there was a form of capital levy known as a liturgy (). The liturgy might anything from financing a public play to supplying and manning a trireme for the navy. An Athenian could volunteer for such a levy, but if no-one volunteered, a wealthy person meeting the eligibility requirements would be ordered to supply it. They could escape by nominating someone wealthier to take over the duty; if the nominated person disputed this, the nominator could take the liturgy, or offer to exchange property with their nominee (antidosis). If the nominee refused, the matter went to court, and the liturgy was assigned whoever the court case determined to be wealthier. Athenians often concealed their wealth to escape taxation, and sycophants who discovered concealed wealth might use it as blackmail material. Antidosis helped the state identify the wealthiest people, and kept the rich suspicious of one another. Athens also had a wealth tax called eisphora (see symmoria), and for this purpose the city required each rich person give an estimate of his fortune (œÑŒØŒºŒ∑ŒºŒ±). These self-assessments were not very accurate. The liturgy has not been much studied by economists. =20th century= During both World Wars, capital levies were introduced, with the generally-stated aim of distributing the sacrifices required by the war more evenly. This had a significant effect on both income and wealth distributions, lasting decades into the post-war period. Such policies were commonly referred to as the \\"conscription of wealth\\".https://web.stanford.edu/group/scheve-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2013/08/ScheveStasavage_IO_2010.pdf The Economist, a British publication, opposed capital levies, but supported \\"direct taxation heavy enough to amount to rationing of citizens' incomes\\"; similarly, the American economist Oliver Mitchell Wentworth Sprague, in the Economic Journal, argued that that \\"conscription of men should logically and equitably be accompanied by something in the nature of conscription of current income above that which is absolutely necessary\\". =21st century= The Italian government of Giuliano Amato imposed a 0.6 percent levy on all bank deposits on 11 July 1992. In 1999, Donald Trump proposed for the United States a one off 14.25% levy on the net worth of individuals and trusts worth $10 million or more. Trump claimed that this would generate $5.7 trillion in new taxes, which could be used to eliminate the national debt.\\"Trump proposes massive one-time tax on the rich\\". CNN. November 9, 1999. The Cypriot government levied 47.5 percent of Bank of Cyprus deposits over one hundred thousand Euros in July 2013. In October 2013, the International Monetary Fund released a report stating, \\"The sharp deterioration of the public finances in many countries has revived interest in a 'capital levy' ‚Äì a one-off tax on private wealth ‚Äì as an exceptional measure to restore debt sustainability. The appeal is that such a tax, if it is implemented before avoidance is possible and there is a belief that it will never be repeated, does not distort behavior.\\"IMF Fiscal Monitor: \\"Taxing Times\\" Oct 2013, p.49 The next year the Bundesbank proposed that Eurozone countries should attempt a one-off levy of bank deposits to avoid bankruptcy.

He was the eldest of three children born to James William Marshall and Ellen Marshall, n√©e Skeet. His mother died in 1901, aged 24, leaving James to raise the children on his own. Marshall joined the Essex Yeomanry in 1915, at the age of seventeen, after lying about his age; he took part in the Battle of Loos in the same year. He was given the nickname \\"Smiler\\" after he threw a snowball at a drill sergeant who threatened to \\"give him something to smile about\\". This event occurred during his basic training at Stanway. Marshall served in the 1/1st Essex Yeomanry and later the 8th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps between 1915 and 1919 and saw action at the Battle of the Somme, Battle of Arras, the Third Battle of Ypres, the Germany Offensive of 1918 as well as the Advance to Victory and the Army of Occupation campaigns at the end of the war. Marshall recalled the horrors of the battlefield and his memories of seeing many of his comrades blown to bits by enemy shells or mown down in No Man's Land by a haze of bullets. The Battle of the Somme, beginning on 1 July 1916, had no greater resonance for Smiler than all the other battles he had fought throughout the war. He had been sent to France in late 1915 and despite a number of periods of home leave had remained in or near the front line for the remainder of the war. He was present on the Somme for the first day of the offensive in which over 20,000 troops were killed in the first several hours, with 40,000 more injured, making the battle one of the heaviest death and wounded tolls of the war. Marshall had been kept well behind the lines during the opening day of the Somme campaign waiting for a breakthrough, however it did not come. As a result of his unit being kept back during the Somme, Marshall was not credited with being the last veteran of the opening day; nonetheless, he remembered the trauma and horror of that campaign and the images on the battlefield remained with him. He later recalled picking up and sending home the letters found next to the body of a man killed near Mametz Wood. In March 1917, Marshall suffered a blighty wound in the hand and was sent home. On his return he joined the Machine Gun Corps and fought at the Battle of Cambrai where he was captured as a Prisoner of War by the Germans. Smiler was released by his captors as they were short of rations and returned to the front. When the war ended in 1918, Marshall volunteered for a tour of duty in Ireland and was stationed near Dublin. He was demobbed in 1921 and returned home to Tendring where he married Florence C. Day. The couple had five children. In his later years, Marshall continued to live in a small house, which was attached to a larger house in which he had worked for the owner since the Second World War. He kept by his bedside a wooden cross taken from the rubble of Albert Basilica at the time of the Battle of Somme. In the final decade of his life, Marshall was awarded the Legion d‚Äôhonneur and appeared on numerous television shows as well as attending a veterans' party at Buckingham Palace. He also took part in three pilgrimages to the battlefields of the First World War, including one to mark the 80th anniversary of the Third Battle of Ypres. Marshall died at the age of 108 on 16 May 2005 in Ashtead, Surrey. At the time of his death he was survived by one son; twelve grandchildren; twenty-four great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren. Marshall's legacy as one of the last surviving veterans of the First World War was that he was able to claim a number of records: the last man to wear the 1914-15 Star; the last man to serve on the Somme and perhaps, the most significant for a man who had served in the Essex Yeomanry, the last man to have served in the cavalry.

He was Sinn F√©in's longest sitting councillor and is currently an MLA for Belfast West as well as being a former councillor for the Laganbank electoral area of Belfast. Early life Maskey was educated at St Malachy's College and at the Belfast Institute for Further and Higher Education and then worked in Belfast docks as a labourer and barman. He was a successful amateur boxer, having only lost 4 out of 75 fights. When the Troubles broke out in 1969 he became involved with the Provisional Irish Republican Army, and was interned twice in the 1970s. Politics Maskey stood unsuccessfully in West Belfast in the 1982 Assembly Election. In June 1983, Maskey won a by-election and became the first member of Sinn F√©in to be elected to Belfast City Council. He was greeted with boos and jeers when he entered the chamber for his first council meeting, and unionist councillors started stamping their feet and screaming when he attempted to deliver his maiden speech in Irish. Maskey emerged as a key ally of Sinn F√©in President Gerry Adams' approach to the strategy. In 1987 he survived being shot at close range by loyalist paramilitaries. He was targeted again by loyalists in 1988, and also a gun attack at his home in 1993 when one his friends was killed. In 1996 Maskey was elected to the Northern Ireland Peace Forum for the Belfast West constituency but did not attend the Forum in accordance with Sinn F√©in's policy of abstentionism. Two years later he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, which on this occasion Sinn F√©in did not boycott. Maskey's growing political profile led him to contest the Belfast South constituency in the 2001 general election as part of Sinn F√©in's strategy of building up their vote in one of their weaker constituencies. In the local elections held on the same day he switched to the Laganbank area of South Belfast and won a seat there. In 2002 Maskey became the first ever republican to serve as Lord Mayor of Belfast. His first duty in office was to open the annual Presbyterian General Assembly despite being a non- Presbyterian. Maskey garnered general praise when as part of his duties as Lord Mayor in July 2002 he laid a wreath in memorial of British soldiers who died in the First World War. However he declined to attend the main memorial ceremony, stating that it was \\"the military commemoration of the Battle of the Somme\\". In his office he flew the British Union Jack and the Irish tricolour side by side. In the 2003 Assembly election Maskey stood in South Belfast again and won Sinn F√©in's first seat there with a boost in the vote share. He contested the same-named House of Commons seat in the 2005 general election with the vote share down on the Assembly elections, losing to the Social Democratic and Labour Party candidate, Alasdair McDonnell. Health On 25 December 2005, Maskey suffered a heart attack while with his family. Several weeks later he appeared on BBC Radio Ulster to talk about his health. Later years In 2006 he participated in the negotiations resulting in the Basque nationalist organisation ETA truce announced on 22 March. On 23 April 2007 he was announced as one of three Sinn F√©in members who would sit on the re-vamped Northern Ireland Policing Board. Maskey resigned from Belfast City Council in October 2010, as part of Sinn F√©in's policy of abolishing double jobbing.\\"Alex Maskey Belfast's first republican mayor quits council seat\\", Belfast Telegraph, 13 October 2010. With the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont, Maskey was elected Speaker on 11 January 2020.

Cherry Hill Mall is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and is bound by Route 38, Haddonfield Road (County Route 644), Church Road (County Route 616), and Cherry Hill Mall Drive. The center was designed by architect Victor Gruen and built and managed by The Rouse Company. Rouse sold its shopping center portfolio to Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust in 2003 as PREIT converted its holdings from residential to retail. The mall has a gross leasable area of , placing it in the top ten among the largest shopping malls in New Jersey. Cherry Hill Mall is widely held to be the source of the 1962 renaming of what had been called Delaware Township to its current name of Cherry Hill Township. The town was named Cherry Hill in a voter referendum due to the development of a new U.S. Postal Service office for the region, and historical ties to Cherry Hill Farm, which once occupied land opposite the current mall site, and various locations named for the farm, including the Cherry Hill Estates housing development and the Cherry Hill Inn. The mall is currently anchored by JCPenney, Macy's, and Nordstrom. History Cherry Hill Mall from Macy's Cherry Hill Mall opened on October 11, 1961 on the former site of the 16 acre George Jaus farm. It was designed by Victor Gruen and built and managed by The Rouse Company\\"The Would-Be City That Won't Be\\", The Washington Post, July 31, 2005. Accessed December 2, 2008. at a cost of $30 million. Upon opening, it became largest mall in the nation and is commonly referred to as the first enclosed and climate-controlled mall in the Eastern United States. The mall featured 90 stores, exotic birds, tropical plants, fountains and a movie theater, something unlike anything in what was called Delaware Township had ever seen. The mall layout was unique for the time. Unlike the dumbbell malls of the time, the mall started from the east anchor, Bamberger's, with a large \\"Delaware Mall\\" concourse to the west of it. About halfway along this concourse was an exit way that led back to a twin movie theatre and a children's amusement park with 6 rides and a mini roller coaster with a giant arcade. The center of the mall featured Cherry Court, a court with high ceilings, more tropical plants, fountains, parrots, plus a staircase leading directly to the second floor into Strawbridge & Clothier. The northern wing featured the \\"Market Court\\", Food Fair, and Thrift Drug. There were also a Kresge's, Woolworth's, and two liquor stores.Newman, Andy. \\"SHOPPING AROUND: AT THE MALL; The Making of a Mall: Managing the Mood and the Merchandise \\", The New York Times, November 16, 1997. Accessed December 2, 2008. The mall changed through the years; 1973 brought a detached nine-story office tower. In 1977 a new two-story wing was built in the north part of the mall, following the closure and demolition of Pantry Pride and the Market Court. This wing was anchored by JCPenney. The 1990s brought more change to the mall, with the mall being remodeled once more, featuring a teal/gray color scheme and skylights. The mall received different fountains and the ornate Strawbridge's staircase was replaced with a simple escalator/stairs combination. By 1997, two distinct parts of the mall had formed: an upscale wing near Macy's featuring Banana Republic and Victoria's Secret, while the JCPenney wing featured General Nutrition Centers and several urban shops. In 2003, the mall was sold to Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PREIT). =PREIT renovation and expansion= The One Cherry Hill office building adjacent to the mall Under PREIT's ownership, Old Navy moved in early on, but the company had bigger plans for the mall. From the period of 2007 to 2009, the mall underwent a massive $220 million renovation that saw 228,000 sq ft. of new retail added. Jim Ryan and his team at JPRA Architects were brought in to create the mall‚Äôs new design. Following Strawbridge's closure after the Macy's takeover, the store was razed and backfilled to make way for the new Grand Court featuring 140,000 sq ft. of new retail, along with a new 138,000 sq ft. Nordstrom anchor store which opened on March 27, 2009. Additionally, the mall added several exterior-facing restaurants in a new section known as Bistro Row. A large- scale entrance to an H&M; store to the frontage of Route 38 was also added, while the food court was also moved to the JCPenney wing, in a much smaller configuration than the mall's original food court but now features many eateries. The mall also added The Container Store and Crate & Barrel as outparcel retailers outside the mall's parking lot. Additionally, a three- story parking garage was constructed, while the whole mall was gutted for a clean contemporary marble-and-wood color scheme. The new changes created a new tenant mix similar to King of Prussia. The mall today consists of many upscale stores in a newly renovated interior and exterior. Cherry Hill Mall has completely changed its entire exterior and interior, bringing many high-end stores, new restaurants, and a revitalizing theme running throughout the center.

Early life Collins was born in Bidston, Birkenhead, on the Wirral Peninsula in Cheshire, now Merseyside. At the age of two he won 'The Most Beautiful Baby in Liverpool' contest.

His first gig was playing with his father's band, and he also joined a group of older school pupils to form a band called The Renegades at the start of the Merseybeat music scene in Liverpool in the late 1950s. His passion for firearms started in his youth from a membership of the Liverpool Central Rifle Club.Obituary for Lewis Collins, The Independent, 28 November 2013. On leaving school, he took an apprentice hairdresser's position at the Andre Bernard Salon, alongside fellow apprentice Mike McCartney (stage name Mike McGear ‚Äì later a member of the comedy, music and poetry trio The Scaffold). In the same period Collins was writing songs with Mike McCartney, and when the drummer Pete Best was dropped from the Beatles, Mike McCartney suggested Collins as a possible replacement to his elder brother Paul McCartney. Turning down the option of an audition with The Beatles, Collins continued playing music on an amateur basis for a number of local bands, including The Eyes, and The Georgians. In late 1964, Collins quit hairdressing to become the bass player with The Mojos (which his father managed), performing on their charting singles \\"Goodbye Dolly Gray\\" and \\"Until My Baby Comes Home\\", and moved from Liverpool to London with them when the band appeared to have good commercial prospects. However the band failed to chart again and broke up, and finding himself in the midst of cosmopolitan London in 1966 during the Swinging Sixties, Collins made a living engaged in temping work such as delivery van driving, cleaning windows and being a waiter, before deciding that he wanted to become an actor after hearing a play being performed on the radio.Interview with Lewis Collins, Granada Tonight, Granada Television (1993). Having been accepted for training in acting by the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, which he attended between 1968 and 1971,Obituary, The Independent 28 November 2013. he drew the notice of his fellow students for an \\"electrifying\\" performance in the lead role of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Theatre career On graduation from LAMDA he joined the Chesterfield Civic Theatre's Repertory Company in 1971, moving to the company of the Citizen‚Äôs Theatre, in Glasgow in 1972 under the director Giles Havergal. While in Glasgow he also taught deaf and mute children mobility skills, learning British sign language so he could communicate with them, later saying that this was the most satisfying work that he had done in his life.Obituary for Lewis Collins, 'The Scotsman' 29 November 2013. In 1972, he appeared in seven plays in Glasgow including the lead in Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great. He then went with Havergal on an acting teaching tour with the Prospect Theatre Company in the United States and Canada, before returning to the British Isles to appear in London's West End, starring in City Sugar and The Threepenny Opera, and at the Royal Court Theatre in the play The Farm in 1973, directed by Lindsay Anderson. After moving into film acting in the mid-1970s, he intermittently returned to the stage throughout his career. He performed in a pantomime of Babes in the Wood at the King's Theatre in Southsea in Christmas 1983. In the mid-1990s he performed in an English provincial tour of the play Who killed Agatha Christie by Tudor Gates.Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch online archive detailing the performance in August‚ÄìSeptember 1993 Performance at the Derngate Theatre, Northampton, 15‚Äì21 May 1994. His last performance in theatre was a 1999‚Äì2000 provincial tour in the English Midlands of J.B. Priestley's Dangerous Corner. Move into television While appearing in The Farm at the Royal Court in 1973 Collins received an offer for his first television role in the British Broadcasting Corporation's police drama Z Cars. His first major television role was in Granada Television's comedy series The Cuckoo Waltz from 1975 to 1977 in the role of Gavin Rumsey, alongside his landlord played by David Roper and landlady Diane Keen, whom his character was constantly trying to seduce. By the mid 1970s he was regularly appearing on British television dramas in multiple roles. The Professionals (1977‚Äì1983) In 1976, the dramatist and television producer Brian Clemens wrote a new British television crime-action drama series entitled The Professionals, modelled on the success of the hit American television series Starsky and Hutch. It was also intended to be a more realistic follow-up to a prior successful television series that he had just produced about government agents entitled The New Avengers. As with the previous series Clemens planned to have a split leads casting arrangement for the new show. Having cast the actor Martin Shaw, Clemens found in the first week of filming that the initial partnership he had arranged for the recording of the pilot episode with the actor Anthony Andrews lacked personal on-screen chemistry due to the similarity of the acting styles of Andrews and Shaw.Interview with Brian Clemens on the making of 'The Professionals', Huffington Post (UK edition), 27 March 2014 He thought of Collins as an alternative after seeing a recently filmed episode of The New Avengers, in which Collins and Shaw (both trained at LAMDA) had appeared alongside one another and there had been a noticeable dynamic tension between them, both in their acting style and off-screen private personalities. After a screen test of Collins, he replaced Anthony Andrews as 'William Bodie'. Although not getting on particularly well with one another personally, the good-humoured antagonism and bravado between Collins and Shaw on-screen worked well and the series was highly successful on British television for the next six years, making household names of them both. The production came to an end in 1981, although new episodes continued to be shown onscreen until early 1983. Military career Collins was a private in the 10th Battalion Parachute Regiment of the British Army (a Territorial Army unit) from 1979 to 1983. In 1983 he applied to join the Territorial SAS but was rejected because of his celebrity status, despite passing the entrance tests. From 15‚Äì23 March 1980 Collins with several volunteers from the Parachute Regiment, along with the British boxer John Conteh, took part in a forced march in military service conditions from London to Liverpool up the A41 road, the funds raised from the event being donated to a charity for disabled children. Acting career (1980s-1990s) In 1982 he auditioned for the role of 007 with Eon Productions, the producers of the James Bond cinema franchise, to succeed Roger Moore, but the audition with its producer Cubby Broccoli did not go well and he was rejected as being \\"too aggressive\\". Collins regarded this failure in retrospect as the key missed opportunity of his acting career.Hill, Valerie (2004) \\"Lewis Collins\\", Liverpool Daily Post, 4 June 2004 In 1982 he moved into cinema starring in the role of a British Army officer confronting terrorists in the film Who Dares Wins. As the 1980s progressed Collins attempted to maintain a cinematic career. An initial plan to continue to make feature films with the Who Dares Wins producer Euan Lloyd, including one set in the Falklands War provisionally entitled Task Force South, came to nothing, so he instead signed a German-Italian co-production contract to star in three mercenary war genre feature films directed by Antonio Margheriti set in the Third World, viz., Code Name: Wild Geese (1984), Kommando Leopard (1985) and Der Commander (1988), which attempted to capitalise on the recent box-office hits of The Wild Geese and The Dogs of War, but they were commercially unsuccessful; as a result he returned to working in British television productions. In 1986 he played the French medieval war-lord Philip Marc in the series Robin of Sherwood. In 1988 he played second lead to Michael Caine in the British television film Jack the Ripper. At the start of the 1990s, he appeared in the role of \\"Colonel Mustard\\" in the British television drama/gameshow Cluedo (1991‚Äì92), however acting roles became sparser as the decade progressed. In the early 1990s, seeking to extend his career options in drama to work beyond acting he attended courses in screenwriting and direction at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in Los Angeles, California, US,Lewis Collins interview, 'This Morning', Granada Television, 1992. but this led to no subsequent professional employment. In the mid 1990s he moved his family to Los Angeles, where he was residing part-time, while he returned to England intermittently for the occasional provincial theatre tour and minor acting roles in television productions. In March 1997, Collins announced in an interview on British television that he was in discussions with a production company to star in a new series based on The Professionals, reprising his career signature role of William Bodie as the CI5 Agency's Chief in the part played by Gordon Jackson in the original series. However, after months of negotiations it was announced by the producer David Wickes that Collins had been dropped as a casting option for the role for undisclosed reasons, and it had been given to the actor Edward Woodward instead. The new show, entitled CI5:The New Professionals, went on to be a commercial and critical failure, and only ran for one series. Collins' final acting performance was in an episode of the British television police drama seriesThe Bill entitled \\"034\\" in 2002.Lewis Collins career listing, IMDb. Final years In 2003, Collins left Britain and abandoned acting and drama, and saw out his last decade in private business in the United States selling computer equipment. In early 2012 his return to acting was announced by his theatrical agent issuing a statement that he had been cast to play the role of the Earl Godwin in the historically based feature film production 1066, but in June 2013 it was announced by the same source that he had withdrawn from the production due to ill health. Death After being first diagnosed in 2008, Collins died at the age of 67 from cancer in Los Angeles on 27 November 2013. Shortly before his death he had returned to visit England, spending some time on Merseyside.'Mike McCartney's tribute to Lewis Collins', The Wirral Globe, 28 November 2013. Collins' body was cremated. An urn holding his ashes is deposited in a memorial display cabinet at the North Pacifica Mausoleum section of Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.

Biography Hentz was born in Versailles, France. He was the youngest child of Charles Nicholas Arnould Hentz and Marie-Anne Therese Daubree Hentz. He studied medicine and learned the art of miniature painting in Paris. His father was an active Republican and participant in the French Revolution. Upon the restoration of the Bourbons in 1815, his father was banished from France. So, in 1816, Marcellus immigrated with his family to the United States, where they settled in Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania. He taught French and miniature painting in Boston, Philadelphia, and other places. He became a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) in 1819. His illustrations were published in their journal. Among these illustrations are three well known watercolors, two of which are of freshwater fish from Alabama (painted in 1847) and one is a miniature of Hentz's father-in-law, John Whiting (painted 1824-1850). In 1820, Hentz enrolled as a medical student at Harvard but soon after abandoned his studies to teach. In 1824/5 he was associated with George Bancroft in the Round Hill School at Northampton, Massachusetts. From 1826 to 1830, he was professor of modern languages and belles lettres in the University of North Carolina. In 1827, he became the \\"chair of modern languages\\" at the university. In 1830, Hentz conducted a female academy for two years. Following, he conducted various schools in Cincinnati, Ohio, 1832-1834; Florence, Alabama, 1834-1843; Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 1843-1845; Tuskeegee, Alabama, 1845-1848; and Columbia, Alabama, 1848-1849\\\\. After 1851, Hentz and his wife lived with his son in Marianna, Florida, where he eventually succumbed to an illness in 1856.  Family  He married Caroline Lee Whiting on 30 September 1824, and moved with his wife to Covington, Kentucky, in 1831. Caroline was an author with numerous published works in periodicals and newspapers. It is rumored that although not a revolutionary, her female characters exhibited strong qualities for assertiveness and independence possibly as consequence of an oppressive relationship with her husband. Her last novel, \\"Ernest Linwood\\" (1858), was based on an incident in which Hentz became jealous of Caroline's admirers and resulted in the end of their residence in Cincinnati. Professor Hentz and his wife had five children: Marcellus Fabius (1825-1827), Charles Arnould (1827-1894), Julia Louisa (1829-1877), Thaddeus William Harris(1830-1878), and Caroline Therese (1833-1904). Julia was born at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. She was educated by both of her parents and married in 1846 to Dr. John Washington Keyes in Tuskegee.Ancestry.com.

The youngest daughter, Caroline Therese was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and also educated by her parents and married the Baptist pastor, Rev. James O. Branch. She went on to publish tales and sketches published in magazines. Charles Arnould became a physician (Allopath).Directory of Deceased American Physicians, 1804-1929 [database on-line].

Religious Concerns  Title page of The Spiders of the United States: A Collection of the Arachnological Writings of Nicholas Marcellus Hentz, M.D. (1875)As the most accomplished entomologist in the United States, Hentz was offered an honorary M.A. degree by the University of North Carolina in 1829. Yet, there were mixed feelings in the community about the renowned scholar. The community at the university was largely Presbyterian and did not approve of Hentz's Roman Catholic background, and was predisposed to \\"ejaculatory prayer\\". The professor also had a severe nervous disorder. Many of his students thought the study of French went against their religious principles. Consequently, Hentz was suspected of French revolutionary liberalism. Professor Hentz resigned from the university in 1833 after finding new academic regulations too restrictive. After Hentz left the university, French was completely dropped from the curriculum. Insects Hentz became a pioneering zoologist in the field of arachnology. In France, he had developed a long lasting friendship with Thomas Say (1787-1834). Originally, he and Say were going to collaborate and illustrate a collection called \\"American Entomology\\". In the United States, Hentz took to collecting insects. He sold his collection to the Boston Society of Natural History in the 1840s. Hentz is best known for describing 141 spider species and these descriptions were published in the society's journal between 1842 and 1850. He was one of the first to collect and document North American spiders. As is custom in binomial naming, each species was noted with his name and the year Hentz classified them. A few spiders from his collection are the Yellow sac spider, the Southern house spider, a common tarantula, and a genus of jumping spider.Cooke, J. (1996). A pioneering spider man.

Water color of a Fresh water fish by Hentz Exemplar of spider drawings Hentz made his first publication on alligators in 1820 which was followed by French textbooks issued between 1822 and 1839. In 1825, he published a novel about the Indian massacre of 1778. This novel is called \\"Tadeuskund, the Last King of the Lenape, an Historical Tale\\". Finally, his major collection in arachnology was republished in 1875.

Etymology The word \\"Tafilalt\\" is an Amazigh word and it means \\"Jug\\", which is specifically a pottery jar used to store water. History In the area, the town of Sijilmasa founded by Miknasa Amazigh leader Moussa ben Nasser in 757 BCE, formerly existed. It was on the direct caravan route from the Niger river to Tangier, and attained a considerable degree of prosperity. In the 17th century, the Alaouite dynasty of Morocco is known to have started in Tafilalt, and in 1606 Zidan al-Nasir, Sultan of Morocco hid in Tafilalt, where he made a profit off of gold mined in the area, built an army, and took back control over Marrakech. A few years later in 1610, Ahmed ibn Abi Mahalli also built up an army in the Tafilalt area and took Marrakech back for himself, but lost control after Sidi Yahya ben Younes liberated the city for al-Nasir. A decade after this, a small revolt built up in Tafilalt against the sultan, but was repressed after four months of skirmishes. Later, Tafilalt was a major center of the Dila'ites. In 1648, a custom was established of the Moorish sultans of Morocco sending superfluous sons or daughters to Tafilalt. Medieval traveller Ibn Batuta wrote about visiting Sijilmasa (near Tafilalt) in the fourteenth century on his journey from Fez to Mali, \\"the country of the blacks\\". It was later destroyed in 1818 by the A√Øt Atta, but its ruins remain, including two gateways. The first European to visit Tafilalt in the modern era was Ren√© Cailli√© (1828), and later Gerhard Rohlfs (1864). English writer W. B. Harris described Tafilalt in a journal after his visit.

Its department stores are JCPenney and Macy's. There is a food court on the second floor, which was originally the second floor of a Woolworth. An office building called One Oxford Valley is located next to the mall. History The Oxford Valley Mall was developed by The Kravco Company and opened in 1973. In 1986, the Gimbels store was converted to Stern's after Allied Stores purchased seven Gimbels locations in the Philadelphia area. That same year, Bamberger's became Macy's. In 1989, Sears replaced Stern's after the latter closed several stores in the Philadelphia area. The mall underwent a renovation in 1990. In 1992, a separate, 10 screen movie theater was added behind Sears (4 new auditoriums were added in 2004). In 1995, the mall opened its food court on the second floor, replacing what had been the second floor of a Woolworth store. In addition, the mall replaced the spiral pedestrian ramp and fountain with a glass-enclosed elevator, upgraded the air conditioning system, and extensively renovated the JCPenney and Sears stores. All fountains were eventually removed with only the outdoor one remaining. The same year, Wanamaker's was converted to Hecht's. In 1997, Hecht's became Strawbridge's after its parent company, May Department Stores, acquired the Strawbridge's chain. In 2006, the Strawbridge's store closed as a result of Federated Department Stores acquiring May Department Stores, with Boscov's taking over the former store. The Boscov's store closed in 2008 as part of their restructuring. On October 15, 2018, Sears announced that its store would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide as a result of the company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The store closed on January 7, 2019. This left Macy's and JCPenney the only anchors. In August 2019, a local news agency reported that Simon Property Group and multiple other related entities have proposed a plan to redevelop the mall and the surrounding property into a mixed use center, including the addition of a 600 unit high-end apartment complex in place of the former Boscov's anchor; that would include studio-2 bedroom units, a fitness center, indoor and outdoor common spaces, dog park, pools, full-time management, maintenance, and concierge services like dog walking on site.

Historical geography is the branch of geography that studies the ways in which geographic phenomena have changed over time. It is a synthesizing discipline which shares both topical and methodological similarities with history, anthropology, ecology, geology, environmental studies, literary studies, and other fields. Although the majority of work in historical geography is considered human geography, the field also encompasses studies of geographic change which are not primarily anthropogenic. Historical geography is often a major component of school and university curricula in geography and social studies. Current research in historical geography is being performed by scholars in more than forty countries.Powell, Richard, and Robert M Wilson. ‚ÄúWhat Futures for the Pillar of Geography? a Report on the 16th International Conference of Historical Geographers, London.‚Äù Historical Geography 43 (2015). Themes Historical geography seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved by understanding their interaction with their local environment and surroundings. Development of the discipline In its early days, historical geography was difficult to define as a subject. A textbook from the 1950s cites a previous definition as an 'unsound attempt by geographers to explain history'.Mitchell,J.B. Historical Geography (Hodder and Stoughton educational, 1954) Its author, J. B. Mitchell, came down firmly on the side of geography: 'the historical geographer is a geographer first last and all the time'. By 1975 the first number of the Journal of Historical Geography Journal of Historical Geography Volome 1, Number 1,1975 had widened the discipline to a broader church: 'the writings of scholars of any disciplinary provenance who have something to say about matters of geographical interest relating to past time'. For some in the United States of America, the term historical geography has a more specialized meaning: the name given by Carl Ortwin Sauer of the University of California, Berkeley to his program of reorganizing cultural geography (some say all geography) along regional lines, beginning in the first decades of the 20th century. To Sauer, a landscape and the cultures in it could only be understood if all of its influences through history were taken into account: physical, cultural, economic, political, environmental. Sauer stressed regional specialization as the only means of gaining sufficient expertise on regions of the world. Sauer's philosophy was the principal shaper of American geographic thought in the mid-20th century. Regional specialists remain in academic geography departments to this day. Despite this, some geographers feel that it harmed the discipline; that too much effort was spent on data collection and classification, and too little on analysis and explanation. Studies became more and more area-specific as later geographers struggled to find places to make names for themselves. These factors may have led in turn to the 1950s crisis in geography, which raised serious questions about geography as an academic discipline in the USA. This sub-branch of human geography is closely related to history, environmental history, and historical ecology.Bal√©e, William (2006): The Research Program of Historical Ecology.

Largest is 1.0 mm in diameter. Carbonate rocks are a class of sedimentary rocks composed primarily of carbonate minerals. The two major types are limestone, which is composed of calcite or aragonite (different crystal forms of CaCO3), and dolomite rock (also known as dolostone), which is composed of mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). Calcite can be either dissolved by groundwater or precipitated by groundwater, depending on several factors including the water temperature, pH, and dissolved ion concentrations. Calcite exhibits an unusual characteristic called retrograde solubility in which it becomes less soluble in water as the temperature increases. When conditions are right for precipitation, calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing rock grains together or it can fill fractures. Karst topography and caves develop in carbonate rocks because of their solubility in dilute acidic groundwater. Cooling groundwater or mixing of different groundwaters will also create conditions suitable for cave formation. Marble is the metamorphic carbonate rock. Rare igneous carbonate rocks exist as intrusive carbonatites and even rarer volcanic carbonate lava.

It recorded a population of 148,406 in the 2019 Moroccan census and is the capital of Taza Province. History Historically Taza was known first as ' RibƒÅt Taza ÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ∑ ÿ™ÿßÿ≤ÿ© ' , a military camp belonging to the Fatimid state , was founded by the local governor Mussa ibn aby Ala√¢fiya ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿâ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ£ÿ®Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÅŸäÿ© who was the leader of Miknassa tribe too. Up to at least the early 20th century, Taza was a considerable trading centre on the route between Fez and the Algerian frontier. Taza was first settled by Miknasa tribesmen, who gave it its name: Miknasa Taza, similar to Miknasa al-Zeitoun (present-day Meknes, another Miknasa settlement). The Almoravid empire took over Taza in 1074. They were replaced by the Almohad empire in 1132. In 1248 the city was captured by the Marinids. Although Taza barred the route of Turks from Algiers seeking conquest in what is now Morocco, it fell to the French in 1914. The old town has Berber monuments, mosques, and a 14th-century madrasa (Coranic school). Population in 1982 stood at 77,216. Geography Taza is located in north-central Morocco, in the south of the Rif region right outside the mountain range on a narrow plain. The city is composed of two formerly separate towns built on separate terraces overlooking a mountain valley. The old-Taza town is at an elevation of 1,919 feet (585 m) above sea level and is surrounded by fortifications; the newer town, established by the French in 1920, is located in a fertile plain at an elevation of 1,460 feet (445 m). Fossil remains indicate that caves in the area were inhabited as early as the Paleolithic Period. One of the most important caves in Morocco, Rhar Chara, is close to Taza. This cave is over 7.6 kilometres long. The city is located in a mountain pass known as the \\"Taza Gap\\", where the Rif mountains and the Middle- Atlas range come together. Through this pass successive waves of invaders moved westward onto the Atlantic coastal plains of northwestern Africa. Climate K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa). Located along the Atlas Mountains, Taza has a seasonal climate, shifting from cool in winter to hot days in the summer months. Rainfall can reach up to 900 mm per year. Sights The old town's main thoroughfare is enlivened by the Grain Market and the Souks where wickerwork, tapestries, jewelry, ...are sold. The road terminates at a square doubling as a parade ground which sports the Al-Andalous Mosque. The Mosque's minaret, constructed in the 14th century, is wider at the top than at its base. Bab el-Qebbour Street crosses the Kissaria (covered marketplace), then leads on to the Market Mosque where it meets up with Bab Jamaa gate, the main point of entry of Taza. Somewhat further south, across from Bab el-Rih, the Wind Gate, a bastion dating from the 16th century closes the ring around the kasbah. Taza's city walls, raised in the 12th century and frequently enlarged on later occasions were equipped with a Borj or fortified tower 26 metres (85 ft) wide at the base by the Saadi Ahmed el-Mansour in the 16th century. The gate with an iron grate and the casemates with terraced roofs are clearly influenced by European military architecture of the time. Topology The topology of the area has imposed a pattern of urban spread. Viewed from above, the city takes the form of a \\"T\\". It has its root in Taza high and stretches north to reach the bed of the Oued Larba√¢. Since the urban stretches east and west along the N6 between Fez and Oujda. At the dawn of independence, the city consisted of the Medina High Taza, the European district occupying a hill called \\"No Adrar Illouz. People usually pronounce Dra√¢ louz. This area became the center of town, and finally the station area a few kilometers below. During the following years (60s, 70s) districts have emerged, midway between downtown and the train station (Bit Goulem, Ourida, Bin-Jradi). During the 80s, other districts make their appearance, especially north of the city (and Massira Al-Quds), extended and developed areas today. The goal of this extension was the slum clearance. It was a success, since 1986 the city was declared a city without slums. The craze is such that sections like (Massira II) are villa style. The 90s marked the beginning of the urbanization of the axis center - Taza above. These are buildings with 6 or 7 floors occupying a strategic content between public facilities (municipality, space, civil protection, hospital ibn baja, high school and college ...) and on the other hand, it is down the high rock a hundred yards. This area is also adjacent to the uptown-Qessou meddah, Friouato and Hay Shuhada (developed throughout the last three decades). More recently this area continues to morph and promises a beautiful view from the heights of the city. The planning now also spread on the road to Fez for several kilometers to reach the intermittently R508 (about Tainast). The development plan provides a direct link between Taza West (at the \\"white bridge\\") and Taza high.
