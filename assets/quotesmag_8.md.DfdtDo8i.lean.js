Founded circa 1890 as a railroad town, Elko prospered in the early 1900s as a local depot and trading center for cotton planters in southern Houston County. History The district around Elko, called the Old Thirteenth Georgia Military District, had been devoted mainly to cotton farming since Houston County was established in the 1820s. By spring 1888 the Georgia Southern and Florida Railroad (or GS&F;) completed a line through Houston County. In the southern part of the county, the railroad passed near two older farm communities called Hickory Grove and Spoonville. The GS&F; Railroad sold land lots for a new town with a railroad depot. The community was first called \\"Elko\\" in 1889. The town of Elko was incorporated in 1891 with an elected mayor-council government.Bobbe Smith Hickson, A Land So Dedicated: Houston County, Georgia ([Perry, Ga.]: Houston County Library Board, 1977), 145-7, 162-5. The railroad depot was the center of business and social life in Elko, and crowds greeted the daily trains that ran from Macon, Georgia through Valdosta, Georgia to Palatka, Florida. Regular passenger service began in March 1890. The line was acquired by the Southern Railway in 1895. Because of the railroad, Elko residents could go shopping in Macon and return home the same evening. They could also travel overnight to Florida and visit the resorts at St. Augustine. In 1900 the town's population was estimated at 500. A newspaper, The Elkonian, appeared in 1899. The Bank of Elko was founded in 1900. =Decline= The boll weevil blight had a devastating effect on the town's commerce. The Bank of Elko soon liquidated its assets and closed, followed by many other businesses in Elko. Local farmers switched to peach crops, and Elko citizens built a peach packing shed, but the town never recovered its former prosperity. In 1915 or afterward, a fire caused by cinders from a locomotive smokestack burned down Elko's remaining stores. Scheduled passenger service to Elko ended in 1930. The town's last mayor was Joe Norton \\"Nick\\" Buff. In the latter half of the twentieth century only Paul Davis' general store, which doubled as the town's post office, remained open in Elko. Origin of the name The origin of the name \\"Elko\\" is unknown, but it is believed to have been bestowed by the GS&F; railroad company in 1889. Other railroad towns named \\"Elko\\" exist in the American states of Nevada and South Carolina. Present-day Elko With the demise of railroad passenger service, Elko became more isolated in the latter half of the twentieth century than it had been in the 1890s, and the population declined. Elko's residential district, with its Victorian houses shaded by oak and pecan trees, attracts some residents who commute to nearby cities. As an unincorporated community, Elko is governed by the Houston County Board of Commissioners and protected by county sheriff's patrols and a volunteer fire department. The town's churches hold both weekly and monthly services, with some residents attending more than one church on alternating Sundays.

However, many believe he died in the summer of 1838. #Run over by an army supply wagon. #Killed by a horse when he went to feed them. #Falling through the ice of Lake St. Clair.

History Barnim the Great of Pomerania-Stettin erected the castle within Szczecin's walls against the will of the burghers in 1346. An older Pomeranian burgh had been leveled in 1249.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.121, In 1490 the castle was partially reconstructed for Bogus≈Çaw X's wedding with Anna Jagiellonka (daughter of king Casimir IV Jagiellon). Between 1573‚àí1582 the castle was rebuilt again, this time in the mannerist style for duke John Frederick by Italian stonemasons according to design by Wilhelm Zachariasz Italus. Two new wings were added to close the courtyard before the medieval southern and eastern wings. The main gate was adorned with ducal crest, the eastern wing was enhanced and the northern wing was intended for chapel. In 1648, due to the tenets of the Peace of Westphalia, the castle become a seat of Swedish governor. Before 1705 another reconstruction occurred to prepare the castle for Queen of Poland - Catherine Opali≈Ñska, who lived here with her daughters Anna and Marie Leszczy≈Ñska (future Queen of France) and a small court between 1705-1711. In 1711 king Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski, who sought refuge before chasing him Saxon and Russian forces, joined his wife and daughters at the castle. After the Great Northern War, in 1720, the city of Stettin become a Prussian property and the castle was allocated to the garrison commander Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, whose daughter Sophie Friederike Auguste (future Catherine II of Russia) was born here in 1729 and was raised in the castle. Under Swedish and later Prussian rule, the castle was extensively modified. In 1840-42 a tower in Classical architecture in allusion to the architecture of Karl Friedrich Schinkel was erected, and the south wing was built in the style of Frederician Rococo. Polish conservations maintain that these modifications under Prussian rule in the 19th were barbaric, devastating the many Renaissance elements in the castle (arcades, attics, vaulting).. Eventually about 60% of the castle was destroyed during World War II (August 1944). Under Polish rule, the castle was rebuilt between 1958‚Äì1980 with some modifications. The castle was seen as a point of contact with the town's lost Slavic past, supporting and legitimizing the cleansing of Germans and subsequent Polonization. The castle was restored to its original 16th-century appearance according to 1653 engraving by Matth√§us Merian (among others). The refernence to the Renaissane appearance was important because during Renaissance times, the town, part of the Holy Roman Empire was ruled by the House of Griffin, whose Slavic or even Piast descence is debated among historians. The castle thus became a lieu de m√©moire for the town's new inhabitants.

This was Capote's first musical, and was the first theatrical production outside of Trinidad and Tobago to feature the new Caribbean instrument‚Äîthe steel pan. It was produced by Saint Subber who was also responsible for Kiss Me, Kate and seven plays by Neil Simon. Synopsis The story concerns two neighboring bordellos that battle for business in an idealized Haitian setting. One of the sex workers, Ottilie, turns down a rich lord to marry a poor mountain boy named Royal. Her madam plots to keep her by having Royal sealed in a barrel and tossed into the ocean. Royal escapes the watery death by taking refuge on the back of a turtle. The lovers are eventually married and live happily ever after. History In the early 1950s Truman Capote became further involved in the performing arts. He was approached once again by producer Saint Subber, who was interested in his recent story \\"House of Flowers\\": would he be interested in adapting the work as a musical play for Broadway? Despite the difficulties they had had in turning \\"The Grass Harp\\" into a stage play, Capote agreed for a second time to collaborate with producer Saint Subber and set to work. Much of the writing was done in the Italian fishing village of Portofino; but Capote and Jack Dunphy found time to travel to Switzerland and Paris before turning to America, where Capote met again with producer Saint Subber and continued his work in the musical. After a Philadelphia try-out, the show opened on Broadway on December 30, 1954 at the Alvin Theatre and played for 165 performances. The director was Peter Brook. The cast included Pearl Bailey, Diahann Carroll, Juanita Hall, Ray Walston, Carmen de Lavallade, Alvin Ailey and Geoffrey Holder (who also provided a section of choreography). Although the show received generally poor reviews, the dance-rhythm infused score has been praised for its mix of blues and calypso. Most of the original orchestral score by Ted Royal has been lost, but the piano score survives.NY Times review of the Encores! production Oliver Messel won the Tony Award for Best Scenic Design, the show's only nomination. There was an unsuccessful Off-Broadway revival in 1968 at Theater de Lys. In 2003, there was an Encores! production, starring Tonya Pinkins and Armelia McQueen as the battling bordello madams and Maurice Hines as Captain Jonas, the smuggler. The virginal Ottilie was played by Nikki M. James, and the mountain boy, Royal, was played by Brandon Victor Dixon. Roscoe Lee Browne played the voodoo priest, Houngan. In 2003, Columbia Masterworks reissued the original cast recording.

Early life  Elizabeth was born on 9 July 1556. She was the daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Heneage, who was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in the latter years of the reign of Elizabeth I. Her mother was the former Anne Poyntz, daughter of Sir Nicholas Poyntz and Joan (n√©e Berkeley) Poyntz. After her mother's death in 1593, her father remarried to Mary Browne, Countess of Southampton on 2 May 1594. Personal life At sixteen years old, she was married to Moyle Finch (‚Äì1614) on 14 November 1572. Moyle was the eldest surviving son of Sir Thomas Finch and the brother of Henry Finch. Together, they were the parents of six children: * Theophilius Finch (1573‚Äì1619), later 2nd Baronet. * Heneage Finch (b. 1576), who died young. * Hon. Thomas Finch (1578‚Äì1639), later 2nd Earl of Winchilsea. * Hon. Sir Heneage Finch (1580‚Äì1631), later Speaker of the House of Commons. * Hon.

Soon after their marriage, her husband became a politician, serving as a Member of Parliament for Weymouth between 1576 and 1584, for Kent in 1593 and for Winchelsea in 1601. He served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1596 and 1605. He was knighted in 1584, and awarded a baronetcy in 1611.

In 1628, she was further elevated by Charles I as Countess of Winchilsea. On her death in 1634, her titles passed to her eldest surviving son, Sir Thomas (who had already inherited his elder brother's baronetcy in 1619). Elizabeth and Sir Moyle are depicted in repose in a monument commemorating members of the Finch family, sculpted by Nicolas Stone . The piece was created after Sir Moyle's death during Elizabeth's lifetime, and is now displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. It was originally in the church of St Mary, Eastwell, Kent, which became a ruin in the 1950s and is now owned by the Friends of Friendless Churches. =Descendants= Through her son Heaneage, she was a grandmother of seven boys and four girls. One of her grandsons was Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham. His daughter Anne married Edward Conway, Viscount Conway, and was a philosopher in the tradition of the Cambridge Platonists and an influence on Leibniz. His daughter Frances married Sir Clifford Clifton, MP.

It was created and produced by Jed MacKay, who also wrote all of the show's original songs. The first two seasons were directed by Doug Williams. The next four seasons were directed by Wayne Moss. It won the Alliance for Children and Television's Best Pre-school Program Award and was also a finalist three times for the Gemini Award for Best Pre-school Program. Although the cast was racially integrated, with two \\"minority\\" cast members and one \\"majority\\" member, this fact was never mentioned by the characters. Their shared humanity was the implicit focus. Every program had a number of elements woven into the plot line that invited its audience to \\"Join In!\\"; in games, songs, puzzles, or stories. The cast also broke the fourth wall, talking to the camera, and thus the audience, as if they were right there on set. The songs broke away from the usual children's format, offering a wide variety of rhythm and styles. The cast also sang live on each show. The series revolved around three adults named Jacob Bennett, Nikki, and Zack, who shared a studio loft together. After the second season, Nikki moved away and was replaced by Kia. In a typical episode, the three would be planning for some kind of play or production that would usually involve Nikki being in charge of music and sound, and Jacob and Zack would be in charge of the set, lighting, costumes, etc. when some form of problem would arise. The show also featured a toy wizard named Winston, his wife Emmelina, and their dog Abra, who lived on a windowsill in the loft. The show was filmed in Lindsay, Ontario.

Greek Queen) is a Tamil language historical novel written by Sandilyan. The story is based on ancient Tamil poetry. The author of this novel is Sandilyan. It is a love story set around 2000 years ago, focusing on the Commander-in-chief of the Chola Army. The story takes place during the period of Karikala Chola, one of the greatest kings of the Early Cholas. Plot summary The story starts in Poompuhar, a port city that was an important harbour for the Cholas during a time of trade between the seafaring nations and Tamil Nadu. Ilanchezhiyan is the commander in chief of the eastern regiment of Cholas. The army includes both Yavanas (Greeks) and Tamils. When walking across the beach sands of Poompuhar, Ilanchezhiyan finds a beautiful Yavana woman gasping for breath on the bank of the Kaveri River. He takes her to his palace and gets assistance from Hippalaas, one of the many Greek soldiers in the Chola army, in rescuing the woman. Hippalaas is scared to go near the woman, and instead salutes her. Ilanchezhiyan learns from Hippalaas that the woman is of royal origin after seeing the royal emblem of a swan on her golden bracelet. Meanwhile, the Yavana chief of the fort hears of the queen's presence in Poompuhar. He sets out to capture Ilanchezhiyan and Hippalaas for taking the queen. Ilanchezhiyan escapes the Yavana soldiers, using the queen as a hostage. With his sword on her back, he rides away into the thick forest on his white Arabic horse. Tiberius, a great naval commander of the time, who had arrived with the Greek queen to the shores of Poompuhar, chases Ilanchezhiyan in an attempt to rescue the queen. The queen falls in love with Ilanchezhiyan, however, and helps him escape from Tiberius. Illanchezhiyan flees with the queen and Hippalaas. Brahmananda, a monk and politician, helps them escape through a secret tunnel into a temple. They disguise themselves as monks performing bhajans, and emerge from the temple's sanctum sanctorum. Ilanchezhiyan learns from Brahmananda of the murder of Ilanchetchenni, the emperor of the Chola kingdom, by his enemies. He agrees to spy for Brahmananda in Uraiyur, the capital of the ancient Cholas. During the mission, Ilanchezhiyan is captured and imprisoned in a cave by Irungovel, the slayer of the king. Ilanchezhiyan escapes to see a palace burning on the other side of Amaravathi river. He rescues a handsome teenage youth (except for his charred legs) from seven armed soldiers. Ilanchezhiyan helps the youth to a palace, where his lover, Poovazhagi, was imprisoned. It is revealed that the youth is the prince of the Chola kingdom. With the help of Ilanchezhiyan, the prince escapes into the forest. Ilanchezhiyan and the Yavana queen run in the opposite direction, straight into Tiberius. Tiberius poisons Illanchezhiyan and crowns the Yavana as the Queen of Poompuhar on the day of Venus festival. The queen knows the ancient Venus festival occurs on the date of Indrathiruvizha of Poompuhar. Meanwhile, Ilanchezhiyan finds himself in a ship en route to Greece and learns that he was drugged and will be thrown to the lions. Hippalaas rescues him from the ship by throwing him into sea. They survive a shark attack, and a powerful wave takes them to shore. When Ilanchezhiyan opens his eyes, he finds himself being sold as a slave along with Hippalaas. Ilanchezhiyan and Hippalaas return to sea as slaves to be sold in Greece. The slave ship is then attacked and captured by pirates of Erythraean sea. The pirate captain is persuaded by Illanchezhiyan to invade Ghana (present day Yemen or Oman). The pirates are taken as prisoners by Iliasu, referred to in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as Eleazus, the King of Ghana. The king forces Ilanchezhiyan to become a disciple of the head priest. Ilanchezhiyan lures the priest on board the slave ship for a religious debate. With the help of Alima, the adopted daughter of the lady commander Iliyasu, and his slave friends, Ilanchezhiyan travels back to Tamil Nadu. The political situation becomes tense when Illanchezhiyan arrives. Tiberius builds a fortress impregnable to anyone from sea or land. The fort has two mechanical towers which can throw spears for several miles. Illanchezhiyan is in the dense forest of Guna Nadu, when he sees a huge army disguised as farmers. The army destroys tanks, ponds, farmlands and buildings under the orders of Illanchezhiyan. Irungovel, the assassin of the emperor, wages war with them but is defeated. Illanchezhiyan and the army enter the fortress of Poompuhar on the day of the Venus festival, and capture the signposts and mechanical towers. The key to the mechanical towers is given to Illanchezhiyan by the queen. Tiberius, his dreams of a Greek empire in Tamil Nadu shattered and now surrounded by the enemy army, stabs her before Illanchezhiyan can run to her rescue. Illanchezhiyan's spear throwing expert commander kills Tiberius, but a second too late. Illanchezhiyan cries for his beloved dead queen. The novel ends with the rightful ownership of the Chola Empire being given to the prince (whom Illanchezhiyan had saved earlier) known later as the legendary Karikala Chola. Illanchezhiyan marries his lover Poovazhagi and then assumes his post as the commander for the Chola Empire.

At two months old, she was also the youngest passenger aboard. Family Dean was born in Branscombe, England, on 2 February 1912 to Bertram Frank Dean (1886‚Äì1912) and Georgette Eva Light (1879‚Äì1975). She had an older brother, Bertram Vere Dean, born 21 May 1910. She never married and had no children. Her father died on the Titanic; her mother died on 16 September 1975, aged 96; and her brother died on 14 April 1992, age 81, the 80th anniversary of the iceberg collision. Aboard Titanic Dean's parents decided to leave the United Kingdom and emigrate to the United States; they were planning to move to Wichita, Kansas, where her father had relatives, and his cousin owned a tobacco shop that he was going to co-own. They were not supposed to be aboard the Titanic, but due to a coal strike, they were transferred onto it and boarded it as third-class passengers at Southampton, England. Dean was barely two months old when she boarded the ship. Her father felt its collision with the iceberg on the night of 14 April 1912, and after investigating, returned to his cabin, telling his wife to dress the children and go up on deck. Dean, her mother, and her brother were placed in Lifeboat 10. Her father did not survive, and his body, if recovered, was never identified. Return to the United Kingdom Millvina (right) and Bertram As was the case with many of Titanics immigrant widows, Etta Dean surrendered any notion of remaining in the United States once it was clear her husband had not been saved. In the 2000 PBS Documentary Lost Liners, in giving her account of the disaster, Millvina described the state her mother was in during the aftermath of the disaster: The White Star Line offered Etta and her children passage back to England aboard . While aboard the ship, Dean attracted considerable attention. An article in the Daily Mirror dated 12 May 1912 described the ordeal: Later years It was not until Dean was in her seventies that she became involved in Titanic-related events. Over the years, she participated in numerous conventions, exhibitions, documentaries, radio and television interviews, and personal correspondence. In 1997, Millvina sailed to New York, along with several members of the Titanic Historical Society, aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2). After a few days in New York, Millvina travelled to Kansas City, and visited the house that her uncle owned, and to where her family was going to settle. Several of her uncle's descendants met Millvina for the first time. In 1998, she travelled to the United States to participate in a Titanic convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, and another in 1999 in Montreal, Quebec. She had also been scheduled to appear at a commemoration of the 94th anniversary of the sinking in 2006, but a broken hip prevented her appearance. She also appeared in the History special Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces. Dean staunchly refused to see James Cameron's film Titanic (1997). She recalled having nightmares after seeing A Night to Remember (1958), the film based on Walter Lord's book, and did not wish to imagine her father as one of the people in the crowd of passengers stranded on the sinking liner. She declined invitations to the premieres of Titanic and Ghosts of the Abyss (2003). In December 2007, she also criticised the BBC and its television programme Doctor Who for including an episode with a starship \\"cruise liner\\" called the Titanic which was similar in appearance to the historical liner. Speaking from her nursing home, she said: \\"The Titanic was a tragedy which tore so many families apart. I lost my father and he lies on that wreck. I think it is disrespectful to make entertainment of such a tragedy.\\" A spokeswoman for the show said: \\"No offence was intended. 'Voyage of the Damned' is set on a spaceship called The Titanic and not a boat.\\" Health issues In April 2008, Dean had accepted an invitation to speak in Southampton at an event commemorating the 96th anniversary of the sinking, but ill health resulting from a respiratory infection forced her to cancel. In December 2008, at age 96, Dean was forced to sell several of her family's possessions to pay for her private medical care following a broken hip. These included a letter sent to her mother from the Titanic Relief Fund, and a suitcase given to her and her mother in New York following the sinking. Their sale raised approximately ¬£32,000. In February 2009, she announced that she would be selling several more items to pay for her increasing medical costs which she said exceeded ¬£3,000 a month. Death Dean died of pneumonia on the morning of 31 May 2009, 97 years and seven weeks after the Titanic sailed, at a care home in Ashurst, Hampshire. She was cremated, and on 24 October 2009, her ashes were scattered from a launch at the docks in Southampton where the Titanic set sail. Since October 2007, Dean had been the last Titanic survivor following the death of Barbara West Dainton, who died at age 96 in England. The Millvina Fund In response to the escalating cost of Dean's healthcare, The Millvina Fund was set up in April 2009 by the Belfast, British, and International Titanic Societies with the exclusive aim of taking care of her nursing home bills. It was given a boost by the Irish author and campaigning journalist Don Mullan at the opening of his worldwide Nokia photographic exhibition, A Thousand Reasons for Living (featuring a portrait of Dean), in Dublin on 22 April 2009. Mullan introduced an additional portrait of Dean's hands, as she signed a card for a Titanic autograph collector, which he produced as a limited edition of 100 copies. He made the edition available at ‚Ç¨500 each and then challenged the director and stars of the film Titanic (1997) ‚Äì James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet ‚Äì singer Celine Dion, and the corporations Sony Music, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures to match him euro-for-euro to support her with her bills. DiCaprio and Winslet led the way with a joint contribution of US$20,000. Cameron and Dion donated US$10,000 each.

It was directed by Jack Clayton (his final theatrical film) and produced by Richard Johnson and Peter Nelson, with George Harrison and Denis O'Brien as executive producers. The music score was by Georges Delerue and the cinematography by Peter Hannan. The screenplay was by Peter Nelson from the novel Judith Hearne by Northern Irish-Canadian writer Brian Moore. The story presents \\"a character study film about a woman's rage against the Church for her wasted life\\". Moore wrote the novel after leaving Ireland, in part because of the religious conflict there, and was living in Canada. The book was published in 1955 and was optioned for the stage and screen almost immediately. John Huston optioned it for a film with Katharine Hepburn. Director Irvin Kershner planned on casting Deborah Kerr. Eventually, Jack Clayton, a Catholic himself, was chosen to direct. The cast also features Wendy Hiller, Marie Kean, Ian McNeice, Alan Devlin, Prunella Scales, Sheila Reid, and Aidan Gillen in his first film appearance. The novel is set in Belfast, but filming took place in Dublin. BBC Radio 4 produced a radio drama adaptation directed by Michael Quinn in 1995. Plot Judith Hearne is a lonely middle-aged Irish spinster from a good family in distressed circumstances who gives piano lessons independently but is losing pupils. After moving into a new Belfast rooming house, she meets and is attracted to the landlady‚Äôs widowed brother, the charming James Madden, who has returned from America.

Future plans  Planned models in OO gauge are a British Rail DP2 and several versions of the Class 128 parcels DMU. In O Gauge a GWR AEC 'Razor Edge' Railcar, British Rail Class 31, Class 40, Class 56 and a Class 17 Clayton are all planned but production is dependent on enough customers placing advanced orders for them. It is hoped that these will mirror the huge success of the \\"Deltic\\" when it was released in 2011. Heljan recently admitted that they had been considering the possibilities of producing a Class 14 \\"Teddy Bear\\" in O gauge but this was not thought to be viable due to lack of customer interest.

Many overseas military units were primarily made up of Irishmen (or members of the Irish military diaspora) and had the word 'Irish', an Irish place name or an Irish person in the unit's name. 'Irish' named military units took part in numerous conflicts throughout world history.Harris, R. G.: The Irish Regiments 1689‚Äì1999 , Sarpedon New York (1989, 1999) Murphy, David: The Irish Brigades 1685‚Äì2006, Four Courts Press Dublin (2007) Murphy, David: Introduction, xvii‚Äìxxi The first military unit of this kind was in the Spanish Netherlands during the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Dutch. A notable example is that of Owen Roe O'Neill. Australia and New Zealand The British colonies of Australia and New Zealand suffered a series of 'war scares' during the 19th century from perceived threats from France and Russia. In 1870, when the last British troops left, defence became the responsibility of locally raised colonial forces. =New Zealand= The first Irish unit formed was in New Zealand - the Christchurch Royal Irish Rifle Volunteers were gazetted on 18 November 1868, re-designated No. 2 (Royal Irish) Company Christchurch R.V. on 4 April 1871, and then disbanded on 11 August 1874. On 29 April 1885, a meeting was held in Christchurch, New Zealand and 95 members of the Irish- community applied to form an Irish volunteer corps. That was accepted on 30 April 1885 as the Canterbury Irish Rifle Volunteers. On 1 June 1892, they were amalgamated with the Sydenham R.V. to form the Christchurch City R.V., gazetted 22 July 1892. New Zealand's Dunedin Irish R.V. were formed 7 May 1885, when 189 men offered their services. The Dunedin Irish R.V. became part of the 1st Battalion Otago R.V. on 25 January 1886, and were disbanded on 13 September 1893. One other Irish Corps was to be formed in the South Island of New Zealand, the Southland Irish R.V., were formed at Invercargill and accepted 10 June 1885 as an Honorary Corps. On 7 August 1885, it applied to be formed into a Garrison Corps and then being disbanded on 9 July 1886. Another N.Z. Irish corps was proposed during a 'war scare' in 1885, the Temuka Irish Rifles, on 13 June 1885, but the proposal was abandoned when the government deemed it improbable that hostilities would ensue. Another Irish corps was proposed on 3 April 1887, and was accepted 24 June as the Auckland Royal Irish R. V. On 13 August 1887, they were posted to the 3rd Battalion Auckland R.V. When inspected on 6 October 1889, they had a total strength of 93 officers and men and they were disbanded on 5 March 1892. The last Irish Corps to be formed in New Zealand was the Irish R.V. (Wanganui), accepted 22 October 1901. They were attached to the 2nd Battalion Wellington (West Coast) R.V. and 'J' Company, formed 16 April 1902, becoming 'I' Company on 1 November 1904. The N.Z. Defence Act of 1911 saw an end to the volunteer system, the Wanganui Irish (by then 'H' Company) were absorbed into the new territorial system when the 2nd Battalion Wellington (West Coast) R.V. were re-designated, 7th Regiment (Wellington West Coast Rifles) on 17 March 1911. An Irish Caubeen was worn by the Nelson, Marlborough, and West Coast Regiment, which came about after a regimental-alliance with the Royal Irish Fusiliers, which took place on 23 September 1949. The blue caubeen and green hackle of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, was formally presented to the NMWC Regiment at a Barrosa Day parade in 1961 but may have been worn on special anniversaries and parades before that. On 24 January 1964, the Ist Battalion Nelson, Marlborough, and West Coast Regiment amalgamated into the, 2nd Battalion (Canterbury, Nelson, Marlborough, West Coast) Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment. N.Z. Army Headquarters ruled that only \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Companies of the new regiment were to wear the caubeen and hackle on dates significant to the regiment. That was found to be unworkable and so the caubeen and hackle were not worn until 1968, when the ruling was changed. Only officers and warrant officers seem to have worn the caubeen during formal parades, and the RNZIR cedar green beret was worn for everyday use. By the early 1990s. all ranks were wearing the caubeen and hackle. On the formation of the Royal Irish Rangers in 1969, the green caubeen of the Irish Rangers was adopted by the New Zealanders. The 2RNZIR discontinued wearing the caubeen in the 1990s due to financial constraints, and it was replaced by the cedar green beret. In November 1998, the NZ mounted-rifles \\"lemon-squeezer\\" hat was introduced army wide, and was worn for formal parades, while the beret was worn for everyday use. In 1999, the rifle green beret was adopted for the New Zealand army and was phased-in in late 2002. The 2nd (Canterbury, Nelson, Marlborough, West Coast) Battalion Group, as the unit was known then, wore the green hackle on the left side of the mounted rifle hat. That was to signify the continued association with the Royal Irish Regiment. =Australia (pre-Federation)= Queensland An offer to form an Irish Corps in the British colony of Queensland, Australia, had been rejected in 1862. Eighteen years after the formation of the first Irish Corps in New Zealand, a Queensland Irish Volunteer Corps were proposed on 18 February 1887, and gazetted 24 February 1887 as 'A' Company Queensland Irish Rifle Corps. Established at Peel Street, South Brisbane with three officers and 100 other ranks, 'B' and 'C' companies quickly followed, formed on 11 March 1887 at Valley, North Brisbane and on 22 March 1887 at Petrie Terrace, West Brisbane. 'D' Company was formed at Gympie on 14 November 1888 with an establishment of three officers and 90 other ranks. The application to form this unit had been submitted on 27 May 1887. The application to form a company at Ipswich was submitted 26 August 1889. They were gazetted on 4 September 1889 as 'E' Company and had a strength of three officers and 90 other ranks. Gazetted the same day were 'F' Company established at Woollongabba, East Brisbane with three officers and 90 other ranks. The final company raised was 'G' Company at Maryborough and again with three officers and 90 other ranks, on 4 December 1889. An application in March 1887, signed by over 100 men willing to form an Irish Corps at Rockhampton came to nothing. 'G' Company at Maryborough was the first to disband on 6 August 1891, followed by 'D' Company at Gympie on 7 November 1894. In a re-organisation during 1896, the Queensland Irish Volunteer Corps were designated 3rd (Queensland Irish) Battalion, Regiment of Queensland Rifles and 'A', 'B', 'C', 'E' and 'F' companies became 'I' ,'J', 'K', 'M', and 'N' companies. On 30 July 1897, 'I', 'K', and 'M' Companies were disbanded; 'L' and 'N' companies were disbanded by August the following year, and this brought to an end the Volunteer Corps in Queensland. New South Wales In November 1895, a meeting was held in Sydney Town Hall when it was decided to form an Irish Rifle Corps. These companies were established and gazetted on 5 March 1896, as the New South Wales Irish Rifles. They were grouped together with St George Rifles and the Scottish Rifles to form an administrative regiment, designated the 5th (Union Volunteer) New South Wales Infantry Regiment on 20 June 1896. Another Irish company was formed in Sydney in 1998. http://www.planetfigure.com/threads/australia-nsw-irish-rifle- regiment-1900.79431/ NSW Irish Rifles ‚Äì belt-buckle http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-conflicts-periods/other/irish_rifle.htm On 1 July 1899, these national companies split to form their own distinct regiments, and the Irish were re-designated as the 8th Union Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Irish Rifles). Badges of the 8th Union Volunteers Infantry Regiment (Irish Rifles) https://harrowercollection.com.au/33rd-infantry- regiment/ For administrative purposes, two non-Irish companies from the Illawarra district (one at Kogarah and one at Bulli) were attached. A further Irish Company was formed at Newcastle, the men being sworn in in June 1900. Twenty-three men of the 8th (Irish Rifles) fought in the Boer War. The 8th Union Volunteers Infantry Regiment (Irish Rifles) was re-designated NSW Irish Rifle Regiment (Volunteers) in 1903, and then became the 1st Battalion NSW Irish Rifle Regiment in 1908. A major re-organisation in 1912 saw the name change to 33rd Infantry Regiment and, in yet another re-organisation in 1918, changed to the 55th Battalion. In 1927 the old NSW Irish Rifles title was revived. The 'Irish connection' finally came to an end in 1930, when the regiment was re-designated as the NSW Rifle Regiment. NSW Irish Rifles ('Vice Regal' cigarette-card) https://sites.google.com/site/irishregimentsoftheempire/australia-and-new- zealand New South Wales Irish Rifles - hat badge variations https://sites.google.com/site/irishregimentsoftheempire/australia-and-new- South Australia The South Australian Register, dated 13 February 1900, carried the following public notice: \\"A meeting of all interested in the formation of an Irish Rifle Corps will be held on Tuesday 20 February at 8pm in the town hall.\\" Afterwards 157 names of volunteers were taken, and after selection, were to become 'F' (Irish) Company, 1st Battalion Adelaide Rifles. At the formation of the Irish Company, it was suggested that a green uniform be worn, but no distinctive uniform was adopted. although a shamrock worked from black braid was worn on the uniform sleeves, and hand-engraved brass harp collar badges were worn. They were worn until January 1910, when the company was ordered to discontinue wearing them, which they did under protest. That was done to secure uniformity of dress with the other companies in the 10th AIR. A green stripe an inch wide was also approved to be worn on the trouser seams, but was later disallowed. Victoria Attempts had been made to form other Irish Corps. A five hundred strong Irish Australian Volunteer Corps was proposed in Melbourne Victoria in April 1885. A number of meetings were held at St. Patrick's Cathedral Hall. =Australia (post-Federation)= With the formation of the Australian Commonwealth military forces in 1903, the Adelaide Rifles became part of the newly-formed 10th Australian Infantry Regiment. That had been the last Irish unit to be formed in Australia. Steps were also taken in May 1901 and May 1910, to form an Irish Australian Regiment in Melbourne, and again in 1941. An Irish Volunteer Corps was proposed at a meeting held in the dining rooms of the Shamrock Hotel, in Perth Western Australia on 18 April 1900. Another Irish corps was proposed in Perth in 1904. An Irish regiment was suggested at Bendigo Victoria in April 1906, and a company of Irish Rifles was considered at Broken Hill NSW in April 1910. An Irish corps was also proposed in Queensland, as part of the 9th Australian Infantry Regiment (Moreton) in 1906. Committees were often appointed, but the corps were never formed. The 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (4 RAR); an infantry battalion formed on 1 February 1964, and renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment on 19 June 2009. 4 R.A.R. is affiliated with Britain's 4th Regiment of Foot Guards (The Irish Guards). The 4 R.A.R. regimental band use the same uniform as the Pipes and Drums of the Irish Guards. The 4 R.A.R. battalion subsequently served in Malaysia as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve from August 1965 to September 1967, and seeing active service in Borneo against the Indonesian army during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation. The battalion began its first 12-month tour of Vietnam on 1 June 1968, returning to Vietnam for its second tour in May 1971. From 1990 to 1993 many individual soldiers from the battalion served with the United Nations in Cambodia. In 1993, soldiers from the battalion were detached for operational service in Somalia. In May 1993, the battalion deployed troops to Cambodia. In 1994, the battalion deployed Rwanda. In 1996, a decision was made to convert 4 RAR to a special forces unit. On 1 February 1997, was renamed to 4 RAR (Commando). The unit conducted operations in East Timor and Iraq, and later lost soldiers killed- in-action during the war in Afghanistan. 2/4 RAR Irish Pipes and Drums https://24rarassociation.com/?page_id=1076 (see image 66) Austria and Austria-Hungary The Habsburgs were the principal employers of Irish soldiers in Central Europe. The multinational nature of the empire meant that gifted foreigners were always welcome and had opportunities not available in other Eastern and Central European countries. By one estimation, over 100 Irishmen were field marshals, generals, or admirals in the Austrian Army, with a corresponding number of men holding commissions in the lower ranks. The first Irishman of note to serve the Habsburgs was Colonel Richard Walsh of Carrickmines, Dublin, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of L√ºtzen. His son Oliver became a Major-General. In all, eleven members of this family were field marshals or generals, the most notable being George Olivier, count of Wallis. Many Irishmen were Inhaber and held rank as regimental colonels. Jacob Butler is the first of these. A Walter Butler was an Inhaber of a dragoon regiment and received praise for his role in the defence of Frankfurt an der Oder. Butler was responsible for the assassination of the Bohemian general Albrecht von Wallenstein, who was in the process of defecting to the Swedes.Projekt Runeberg: Walter Butler Another Irishman to serve as field marshal was Francis Taaffe, 3rd Earl of Carlingford. While attending the Jesuit college at Olomouc, he came to know Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, and this benefited his career greatly. He played a prominent role in saving Vienna in 1683 and in the subsequent conflict with the Turks. He later became a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece and served Charles V as his prime minister. Maximilian Ulysses Browne was of the first generation born in Austria but was from a prominent Limerick family. Through his mother he was descended from the FitzGeralds, Earls of Desmond. Browne was a major-general by the age of 30. He rose to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall and died leading his men into battle during the Battle of Prague. Browne was a kinsman and mentor to Franz Moritz von Lacy (son of Peter Lacy) who rose to be president of the Hofkriegsrat from 1766 to 1774. Other famous Irish-Austrian generals included William O'Kelly from Aughrim in Co. Galway; John Sigismund Maguire of Co. Kerry, who captured Dresden in 1758 and successfully defended it against Frederick the Great, who mentioned him on a number of occasions; and General Karl O'Donnell, was known for his exceptional conduct at the Battle of Torgau. Meanwhile, Colonel Hume Caldwell of Co. Fermanagh was noted for his conduct at Breslau and Olm√ºtz, where he perished. Unusually, Caldwell was of Protestant origin. Field Marshal Laval Nugent von Westmeath was prominent during the Napoleonic Wars and was most noted for his role in the capture of Rome in 1815. In recognition of this, Pope Pius VI made him a prince in 1816. There were no Irish regiments in the Austrian Army with influence confined to nobility serving as officers.

By the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, well over one-third of the military forces of the British Army consisted of Irishmen, because of:- * the Kingdom of Ireland electing, from the Crown of Ireland Act 1542, to be in a personal union with: ** House of Tudor ** from the 1603 Union of the Crowns, with the House of Stuart, and from 1707 the Stuart Kingdom of Great Britain ** from 1714 the House of Hanover * from Irish House of Commons approving the acts of Union 1800, through the partitioning Government of Ireland Act 1920, and 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, Ireland was a constituent nation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the North continuing as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. * the traditions of the nobility and landed gentry, which caused them to prefer military service to a career in trade (see: Noblesse oblige) * economic necessity * ambition * family tradition Irishmen with notable or outstanding overseas careers included:- * Major- General John Ardagh * Admiral Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer * Rear Admiral Francis Beaufort * William Blakeney, 1st Baron Blakeney * Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Dermot Boyle * Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Bulfin * Admiral of the Fleet Sir George Callaghan * Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester * Major General Sir George Colley * Lieutenant-General Sir Eyre Coote * Lieutenant- general Alan Cunningham * Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope * Field Marshal Sir John Dill * Major-General Beauchamp Doran * Eric Dorman-Smith * Major-General Lord Dugan * Paddy Finucane * Air Chief Marshal Sir Francis Fogarty * Field Marshal Viscount Gough * Rear-Admiral James Macnamara * Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne * Major General Sir Charles Gwynn * Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings * Tom F.

Of these thirty were awarded in the Crimean War, 52 in the Indian Mutiny, and 46 in numerous other British Empire campaigns between 1857 and 1914. In the 20th century, 37 Irish VCs were awarded in the First World War, ten in the Second World War. One has been awarded in Afghanistan in the 21st century to a Belfast-born soldier of the Parachute Regiment. = 'Irish' named units of the British Army = * What is now the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was founded in 1674 as \\"The Irish Regiment\\" * The Volunteers of Ireland (1777‚Äì82), were renamed the 105th Regiment of Foot * The Catholic Irish Brigade (1794-1798) * 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, amalgamated 1922. * 5th Royal Irish Lancers, disbanded in 1921, reconstituted and amalgamated in 1922. * 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons * 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, amalgamated 1958. * 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, amalgamated with the 12th Royal Lancers to form the 9th/12th Royal Lancers in 1960. * Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, created 1958, amalgamated 1993. * Queen's Royal Hussars (Queen's Own & Royal Irish). created 1993. * North Irish Horse * South Irish Horse * Irish Guards The Royal Irish regiment in the Battle of Amoy in China, 26 August 1841 * Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, amalgamated 1968 * Royal Irish Fusiliers, amalgamated 1968 * Royal Ulster Rifles, amalgamated 1968 * Royal Irish Rifles, renamed as Royal Ulster Rifles 1921. * Royal Irish Rangers, created 1968, amalgamated 1992 * Royal Irish Regiment * Tyneside Irish Brigade, disbanded 1918. * London Irish Rifles, amalgamated 1992 * Liverpool Irish. * Royal Irish Artillery, amalgamated 1801. * Ulster Defence Regiment, amalgamated 1992 * 135th (Limerick) Regiment of Foot 1796 (highest regimental number of any British line regiment.) = 'Irish' named 1922 disbanded units of the British Army = Following the establishment of the independent Irish Free State in 1922, the six regiments that had their traditional recruiting grounds in the counties of the new state were all disbanded.Murphy, David: Irish Regiments in the World Wars (Osprey Publishing (2007) ), p. 20 quote: \\"Following the treaty that established the independent Irish Free State in 1922, it was decided to disband the regiments that had their traditional recruiting grounds in southern Ireland: The Royal Irish Regiment; The Connaught Rangers; The Prince of Wales' Leinster Regiment; The Royal Munster Fusiliers; The Royal Dublin Fusiliers; The South Irish Horse\\" On 12 June, five regimental Colours were laid up in a ceremony at St George's Hall, Windsor Castle, in the presence of HM King George V.Harris, Major Henry E.

Canada  The Irish Regiment of Canada in the Second World War was the only Canadian Irish unit to fight in any war. It also perpetuates the active service of the 1st Canadian Machine Gun Battalion from the First World War and the indirect service of the 190th (Sportsmen) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, and the 208th (Canadian Irish) Battalion, CEF. Served as 1915 110th Irish Regiment; 1920 ‚Äì The Irish Regiment; 1932 ‚Äì The Irish Regiment of Canada; 1936 ‚Äì The Irish Regiment of Canada (MG); 1940 ‚Äì The Irish Regiment of Canada.

The colonel had Irish ancestry, but the largest group of its men were recent eastern European immigrants from the fringes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire who spoke Ukrainian but would have had Austrian citizenship. This combined with the 211th (Alberta Americans) Battalion, CEF, to form the 8th Battalion, Canadian Railway Troops, which served in France building and maintaining railroads. = 'Irish' named units of the Canadian Army = * The Irish Canadian Rangers * The Irish Fusiliers of Canada * The Princess Louise Fusiliers.

By 1916 only 52 men had volunteered, and the plan was abandoned. In the Second World War an even smaller number volunteered to join the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany and were trained at Friesack Camp. Separately some IRA sympathisers planned certain operations with the Abwehr that were generally unsuccessful.

By 1860 the ability of foreign countries to recruit in Ireland and Great Britain was frowned upon but still technically possible. It wouldn't be outlawed for another ten years with the Foreign Enlistment Act. Despite been promised that they would serve in a single brigade they were scattered among other brigades with men from other European Catholic countries. They were poorly clothed and equipped but fought with gallantry. The first battle they played a part in was Perugia where after most of the Papal force surrendered the Irish continued to fight. The next battle where the Irish fought was Spoleto. 300 Irish volunteers under Myles O'Reilly held off 2,500 veteran Piedmontese, including Victor Emmanuel's elite light infantry the Bersaglieri for fourteen hours including vicious hand-to- hand fighting. The next significant engagement was the Battle of Castelfidardo where 150 Irishmen fought. The war ended shortly after this when the outnumbered and outequipped Papal army were ordered by Pius to lay down their arms. Apart from Myles O'Reilly this was the first military experience of Myles Keogh who later on to fight with distinction during the US Civil War and after in the United States Cavalry until he fell at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. Portugal Kingdom of Portugal * Marshal William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford; head of the Portuguese army from 1809 to 1820. Russia The most recognised and outstanding Irishman to serve in the Russian Army was Peter Lacy from Bruff, County Limerick, who died in 1751 while governor of Livonia. Lacy's daughter married another Irish man from Limerick, General George Browne who became a Russian general and their son Johann Georg von Browne also rose to the rank of general in Russia. Count John O'Rourke was a prominent military theorist during the time of Catherine the Great. O'Rourke and his brother Cornelius joined the Russian Army. Cornelius married a niece of Lacy. John O'Rourke's son Joseph Cornelius O'Rourke rose to the rank of lieutenant general during the Napoleonic period. Another prominent descendant Eduard Alexander Ladislaus Graf (Count) O'Rourke became the bishop of Gda≈Ñsk in the inter war years and died an exile in Rome in 1943. * Field Marshal Count Peter von Lacy Sweden Irish military involvement in the Swedish army was neither happy nor successful. At the beginning of the seventeenth century about 6,000 men were shipped out of Ulster for the security of the plantation and sent to Sweden. They were especially unhappy fighting for a Lutheran power. Some Irish friars disguised themselves as soldiers and moved among the men encouraging them to desert to Catholic powers. The men then left Swedish service and most joined the army of Poland. After this incident Gustavus Adolphus refused to accept any large scale recruitment of Irishmen considering them untrustworthy. However a small number went to serve in the officer corps. The most prominent of these was Hugh Hamilton, 1st Viscount of Glenawly. Two of his nephews also entered Swedish service.

Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetu√°n The first major military exodus of Irishmen to Spain happened after the failure of the Second Desmond Rebellion in 1583. At least 200 Irish were part of the Armada in 1588. About the same time, in 1587, 600 Irishmen under the command of Sir William Stanley sent to aid the Dutch in their war with Spain switched sides with their commander and served Spain. The next great exodus of Irishmen to serve in the armies occurred after the Siege of Kinsale. An Irish regiment was formed in 1605 and Colonel Henry O'Neill was placed at its head. Five other Irish regiments were formed between 1632 and 1646 and were placed under the command of The Earl of Tyrconnell, Owen Roe O'Neill, Thomas Preston, Patrick FitzGerald and John Murphy. Later they were joined by Irishmen who had served in the army of Henri de Bourbon and Charles IV. The difficulties that plagued them at home were carried to the continent when O'Donnells refused to serve under O'Neills and tension existed between the Old English and the Old Irish. This was especially evident in tensions between O'Neill and Preston. After the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland there was a fresh exodus of men which suited the English as it ensured that men of fighting age would be engaged in wars on the continent. In one incident in 1653 during the Siege of Girona (Principality of Catalonia) some of the Irish defenders deserted and joined the French under de Bellefonds. With the restoration of Charles II in 1660 most of the remaining Irish chose to return to Ireland. Two regiments remained under the command of the O'Neills and Hugh Balldearg O'Donnell. With the War of Succession in 1701 Irish regiments were reformed mostly via France. Two dragoon regiments were formed and named after their founders, O'Mahony (1703) and Crofton (1705). Four infantry regiments were formed between 1702 and 1718 while a fifth transferred from French service in 1715. They were named: *Regimento de Infanter√≠a de Hibernia (1705‚Äì ) *Regimento de Infanter√≠a de Irlanda (1702‚Äì ) *Regimento de Infanter√≠a de Limerick (1718‚Äì ) *Regimento de Infanter√≠a de Ultonia (Ulster) (1718‚Äì ) *Regimento de Infanter√≠a de Wauchop (1715‚Äì ) *Regimento de Infanter√≠a de Waterford (1718‚Äì ) There was a certain amount of reorganisation, so the Regimento de Infanter√≠a de Waterford became the second battalion of Irlanda in 1733. When Charles, Duke of Parma (future Charles II) became King of Naples and Sicily he took Regimento de Infanter√≠a de Limerick with him into Neapolitan service, where it was known as Regimento del Rey. The remaining regiments remained in Spanish service and wore red uniforms until 1802, when they changed to light blue in common with the remainder of the Spanish army. * Donal Cam O'Sullivan Beare * Hugh Dubh O'Neill * Shane O'Neill (son of Hugh) * Field Marshal Alejandro O'Reilly * Juan O'Donoj√∫ * Joaqu√≠n Blake y Joyes * Ricardo Wall * Leopoldo O'Donnell y Jorris * Carlos Luis O'Donnell y Jorris * Ambrosio O'Higgins * Charles Wogan Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939) * Frank Ryan * Eoin O'Duffy * Irish Brigade (Spanish Civil War) * Irish Socialist Volunteers United States of America Commodore John Barry by Gilbert Stuart Irish have been fighting in the United States and British North America all the way back to the mid 1600s mostly in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and the Carolinas.

In September 2003, he returned to Celtic succeeding Ian McLeod as Chief Executive. The job title was changed for Lawwell to Executive Director, Head of Operations as many of the previous Chief Executives had performed poorly in that role. Arsenal were interested in appointing Lawwell as their chief executive in 2008, but Lawwell rejected their approach. Lawwell has been credited with increasing revenue, reducing debt and is considered a tough transfer negotiator. He has attracted criticism since 2008, however, as rivals Rangers had won three championships in a row. In particular, Celtic fans cite the club's refusal to increase their offer for Steven Fletcher in January 2009, after which Rangers overhauled Celtic to win the 2008‚Äì09 Scottish Premier League championship. In 2010 it was reported that Lawwell earned a wage of more than ¬£700,000 a year, after receiving a 25% rise from his previous contract for the 2008‚Äì09 season. After Celtic failed to win a trophy in the 2009‚Äì10, season he apologised to the Celtic fans. Celtic then sold Aiden McGeady for ¬£9.5 million and reinvested the proceeds in new players, including Emilio Izaguirre, Beram Kayal and Gary Hooper. In July 2011, Lawwell was named as part of the Scottish Football Association's new professional game board which was set up to advise over professional football in Scotland. By March 2012, Celtic, under Lawwell's guidance, were nearly debt-free. Celtic won the 2011-12 Scottish Premier League and after this Lawwell spoke of his desire for Celtic to get back to competing regularly in the Champions League. He also praised manager Neil Lennon and the management staff.

He also excelled in baseball, spurning contract offers in order to remain on the gridiron. Green Bay Packers In 1962 the reigning world champion Green Bay Packers drafted Green in the 14th round of the 1962 NFL Draft, but during training camp they traded him to the Cleveland Browns where he would make a name for himself as one of the league's top running backs. Cleveland Browns After seeing only limited action as a rookie in 1962, Green was installed in the Cleveland backfield the following year alongside legendary Hall of Famer Jim Brown. He finished his first full season of action with 526 rushing yards, and also caught 28 passes out of the backfield. Even more importantly, he also helped open holes for Brown to gain a then-NFL record 1,863 yards. In 1964, the two helped the Browns capture their fourth NFL championship, capping the year with a stunning 27-0 shutout of the Baltimore Colts at the 1964 NFL Championship Game. Following Brown's retirement in July 1966, Green was switched from halfback to fullback and teamed with another future Hall of Famer, Leroy Kelly, to continue to give Cleveland one of the most dangerous backfield combinations in the NFL. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in each of the next two seasons,Ernie Green Statistics and was twice named an NFL All-Pro. In August 1968, Green injured his knee during a preseason contest in Los Angeles and missed the next two months. On his return, he saw only limited action due to lingering problems with the knee. Just after the end of the season, he underwent surgery to repair torn cartilage in the troublesome knee but was then advised to retire. He followed that advice and accepted the Browns' offer to coach their running backs. In his seven-year NFL career, he gained 3,204 yards and caught 179 passes out of the backfield.

It was a version of the Fiat 600 made under licence from 1962A. J. Jacobs, Automotive FDI in Emerging Europe, page 297 and was longer in length than the Fiat version. The Zastava 750 has a engine, which produces . The more powerful 750 SE has at 5400 rpm and torque is at 3600 rpm. It is the smallest car ever made by Zastava. Later on during production, in 1980, the Zastava 850 was introduced. It is nearly identical to the Zastava 750 but the engine had a larger capacity. The Zastava 850 is harder to find than the 750 model but both are still widely available in former Yugoslavia. The Zastava 750 is widely known by its nickname \\"Fiƒáa\\" (–§–∏—õa) in Serbian, \\"Fiƒáo\\" in Bosnian and Croatian, by \\"Fiƒço\\" or \\"Fiƒçko\\" in Slovene and by \\"Fikjo\\" (–§–∏—ú–æ) in Macedonian. The nickname \\"Fiƒáa\\" comes from the main character of a comic published by the newspaper Borba during the first years of the car's production.

It received a Zastava 750 badge in 1962. The 750 retained frontal suicide doors (rear-hinged) until 1969. Later it got bigger front lights, autoadjusting brakes, seatbelts, slightly improved interior and many other small improvements. The later Zastava 850 had many improvements from the original model, but it retained the same 600 body style. The 750 used a 25 hp (30 hp in the 750 SE) 767 cc engine, while the 850 received an 848 cc version providing 32 hp and a useful dollop of extra torque. Production of the Zastava 750 began on 18 October 1955 and ended on 18 November 1985. The car's popularity has started increasing in the last years, partly from the low fuel consumption and very cheap price as a second hand vehicle. Also it starting to become a symbol for nostalgia, and many youngsters that need cheap utilitarian vehicle with a bohemian status symbol are buying this car as a second hand vehicle. Because of that prices have risen in the last couple of years and many fan clubs have emerged. Colombian assembly The Zastava 750 was also assembled in Colombia - next to a variety of American Jeeps as well as other Fiat models - by Leonidas Lara (C.C.A.) in Bogot√°. It was sold in Colombia as the \\"Fiat 750Z\\", from 1977 until 1984. The 750Z was built in comparatively large numbers for the first three years, after which production slowed down considerably.

A. Alan B. Pritsker (February 5, 1933--August 24, 2000) was an American engineer, pioneer in the field of Operations research, and one of the founders of the field of computer simulation. Over the course of a fifty-five- year career, he made numerous contributions to the field of simulation and to the larger fields of industrial engineering and operations research.  Biography  Alan Pritsker was born in Philadelphia to Robert and Gertrude Pritsker. He served on the faculties of Arizona State University (1962‚Äì69), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (1969‚Äì70) and Purdue University (1970-98). In addition to educating many undergraduate-level students in hundreds of traditional academic courses and industrial short courses on simulation, Alan Pritsker compiled a superlative record as an adviser of graduate students. Of the eighteen doctoral students and over sixty master's students who completed their graduate work under his supervision, all are highly successful professionals in academia, government or industry. From 1970 to 1973 he was also the director of Purdue's Center for Large-Scale Systems. During the 1970s and 80s, his activities at Purdue led to what many observers have called the \\"Golden Age of Simulation\\". He was a co-founder of Pritsker & Associates, Inc. (1973). He also served as the Board Chair of FACTROL, Inc. (1986‚Äì89). When Pritsker Corporation was created in 1989 through the merger of Pritsker & Associates and FACTROL, he served the new company as Board Chair and CEO (1989‚Äì91 and 1996‚Äì98) and as President and CEO (1991‚Äì96). He cofounded the Operations Research Division of AIIE in 1968 and he served as the director of that division from 1968 to 1970. He also co-originated the AIIE Systems Engineering Conference in 1973. Alan Pritsker's service to professional societies was not limited to IIE. From 1973 to 1979, he served the Society for Computer Simulation as the SIMULATION journal's area editor for combined discrete-continuous simulation. Elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1985, Alan Pritsker enjoyed the distinction of being the second industrial engineer to join that organization. For over fifteen years, he actively served the National Academy of Engineering in many positions of great responsibility. By his leadership in these various professional societies and governmental organizations over the past forty-five years, Alan Pritsker contributed significantly to the dramatic growth of the field of simulation as well as the larger fields of industrial engineering and operations research. In 1966 Alan Pritsker received the \\"AIIE Distinguished Research Award\\" and he was elected a Fellow of AIIE in 1978. In 1987 he received the \\"Arthur Young‚ÄìVENTURE Magazine Entrepreneur of the Year Award\\". He also received honorary doctorates from Arizona State University (1992) and Purdue University (1998). It is especially noteworthy that in 1991, he received from IIE the \\"Frank and Lillian Gilbreth Industrial Engineering Award\\", the highest and most esteemed honor presented by that organization. For his long-standing, exceptional service to the international simulation community, he received the ‚ÄúDistinguished Service Award‚Äù from the INFORMS‚ÄìCollege on Simulation in 1991. Moreover, in 1999 he received the ‚ÄúLifetime Professional Achievement Award‚Äù from the INFORMS‚ÄìCollege on Simulation, which is the highest honor given by that society. The Pritsker Award is given each year at Arizona State University for outstanding accomplishment in teaching. The Institute of Industrial Engineers Pritsker Doctoral Dissertation Award recognizes outstanding graduate research in the field of industrial engineeringThe Pritsker Doctoral Dissertation Award (retrieved October 29, 2006)  Work  Comprehensive documentation of his career can be found in his professional autobiography Papers, Experiences, Perspectives (Systems Publishing Corporation 1990). In March 2001 an article entitled \\"Alan Pritsker‚Äôs Multifaceted Career: Theory, Practice, Education, Entrepreneurship, and Service\\" appeared in a special issue of IIE Transactions honoring Alan Pritsker for his numerous contributions to the profession over five decades. = Discrete-continuous system simulation = Foremost among Alan Pritsker's achievements is his work in the theory and methodology of discrete and combined discrete-continuous system simulation. During the early 1970s, he and his students formulated the basic principles of combined discrete-continuous simulation and implemented those principles in the GASP IV, SAINT, and SMOOTH simulation languages. Subsequently, he extended the foundations of combined simulation to encompass the process-interaction approach; and working with several collaborators, he implemented a family of simulation software systems, including SLAM and its extensions‚ÄîSLAM II, TESS, SLAMSYSTEM, FACTOR/AIM, and Visual SLAM/AweSim. His strategic vision of a family of related simulation software products played a crucial role in the growth and maturing of the field of simulation over the past thirty years. = Stochastic network = Alan Pritsker also made numerous fundamental contributions to the theory and methodology for analysis of stochastic networks and more general large-scale simulation experiments. For this work he received the ‚ÄúH. B. Maynard Innovative Achievement in Industrial Engineering Award‚Äù from the American Institute of Industrial Engineers (AIIE, now IIE) in 1978 and the ‚ÄúOutstanding Simulation Publication Award‚Äù from The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS, now INFORMS) College on Simulation and Gaming (now the College on Simulation) in 1985. = Engineering theory and practice = Among Alan Pritsker's diverse contributions to engineering practice, perhaps the most prominent was his development and use of large-scale simulation models to support policy analysis for organ transplantation by the United Network for Organ Sharing. In particular, his work was used to formulate more effective and equitable protocols for assigning liver transplants to waiting patients. This is a remarkable example of the definitive practice of system simulation in addressing ultimate questions of life and death. Most of Alan Pritsker's groundbreaking contributions to engineering theory, methodology and practice are widely available via numerous well-known texts and book chapters that he wrote over a period of forty-five years. Perhaps more than any other single individual, he effectively disseminated knowledge about simulation technology at all levels of academia, government and industry through the publication of twelve popular textbooks. = Simulation = Another prominent aspect of Alan Pritsker's contributions to the growth of the field of simulation was his role in founding and leading several commercial enterprises dedicated to the development and dissemination of simulation technology. Alan Pritsker's service to the profession spanned a broad range of activities sustained over four decades. Perhaps his most prominent contributions in service were made through his leadership of the Winter Simulation Conference (WSC). He served as a member of the WSC Board of Directors representing AIIE from 1970 to 1973. He also served on the WSC Board of Directors representing TIMS‚ÄìCollege on Simulation and Gaming from 1981 to 1987; and he served as Board Chair from 1984 to 1985. He was an active participant in the technical program of the WSC each year for over thirty years, and in 1989 he delivered the keynote address for that conference.  Quotes  Lee Schruben of the University of California, Berkeley describing Alan Pritsker's influence on the industry: > \\"Alan is directly responsible for the success of many careers in simulation, > mine included. Indeed, he was the first, and maybe the last, to demonstrate > that it is possible to be a first-rate practicing engineer, scholarly > researcher, devoted teacher, and successful entrepreneur. Many people in the > field have modeled their careers after one of these characteristics of Alan > ‚Äî none, to date, have succeeded in doing all four. Almost everyone in our > field has been influenced at least indirectly by Alan's activities.\\" John White, Chancellor Emeritus of the University of Arkansas, summarizing Alan Pritsker's contributions to the field of simulation with the following memorable comparison: > \\"I believe Alan Pritsker's accomplishments surpass those of, arguably, the > world's greatest hockey player, Wayne Gretzky. It is said that good hockey > players skate to where the puck is, but Gretzky skates to where the puck is > going to be. Alan Pritsker did not just skate to where simulation was going > to be; instead he took it to where it needed to be. He has shaped and > defined the field.\\"Pritsker by James R.

He was one of the leaders of the May Fourth Movement in 1919. He studied experimental psychology at University College London from 1920‚Äì23. He was also one of the creators of the Academia Sinica, and was named director of the Institute of History and Philology upon its founding in 1928.Xu Yahui (Hsu Ya-hwei) Ë®±ÈõÖÊÉ†; Ancient Chinese Writing, Oracle Bone Inscriptions from the Ruins of Yin, 2002.

National Palace Museum, Taipei. Govt. Publ. No. 1009100250, p.8 Early years Fu was born on 26 March 1896 in Shandong, immediately after the First Sino-Japanese War, a time when the traditional systems were being challenged and revolutions were about to happen. In 1909, Fu entered the secondary school set up by Tianjin government, excelling in mathematics, English, and Chinese. In 1913, Fu was accepted by the preparatory school of Peking University where he ranked first upon graduation in humanities division.Wang, Fan-shen, Fu Ssu- nien: A life in Chinese history and politics. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000 In 1916, Fu went on to the Chinese Department of Peking University to pursue his bachelor's degree. During his time at the university, Fu gradually changed from a conservative to a radical. In 1919, Fu participated in the famous May Fourth Movement and was one of the major students leaders. On the morning of 4 May 1919, Fu led a group of approximate 3000 students to protest the Chinese government's weak response to the Treaty of Versailles, which ceded the Shandong province to Japan.Vera Schwarcz, The Chinese Enlightenment: Intellectuals and the Legacy of the May Fourth Movement of 1919, University of California Press, 1986 In 1920, Fu went to Europe to continue his education. His first stop was University College London. Fu registered in the department of Psychology and took most courses at undergraduate level. He also spent a considerable amount of time in medical school courses. In June 1923, Fu traveled to Berlin and studied at Berlin University because the high inflation in Germany after World War I gave him a favorable exchange rate. It seemed that Fu never intended to obtain a B.A degree at these overseas institutions. Instead, he advised his friends to utilize this rare chance to pursue as much learning as possible. Academic career In October 1926, Fu accepted an offer from Sun Yat-sen University and joined the faculty of humanities and social science. He became the department head in 1928. On the national scene, he established the Institute of History and Philology (IHP) of Academia Sinica, and remained as director until his death. In 1929, Fu moved the Institute of History and Philology to Peking and started to teach at Peking University, his alma mater. In 1945, Fu was appointed as acting president of Peking University at the age of 50. In 1946, his second year as the acting president, he excluded many \\"turncoat\\" professors who supported the Wang Jingwei government, a puppet government controlled by Japanese forces during World War II. During his term, Fu also recruited many famous scholars at that time, such as Ji Xianlin and Zhu Guangqian. Fu did not shy away from controversy. After the organization of the path-breaking Yinxu excavations, he published his East Yi West Xia theory about the origin of the Shang dynasty culture in China. This theory has not been accepted by later scholars, but Fu's approach and techniques were widely influential. He is known due to his pioneering historico-philological research of the concepts of \\"nature\\" (xing ÊÄß) and \\"destiny\\" (ming ÂëΩ). Rather than making arguments based on philosophy, he developed interpretations proceeding from the archaic morphemes Áîü and ‰ª§. His condemnation of the Chinese medicine guoyi as being not scientific remains a point of debate. Despite his own call for historical objectivity, Fu opposed the Japanese aggression with the quasi- historical claim that Manchuria and Mongolia were not entitled for independence from China. In 1947, after witnessing the drastic deterioration of the economy, Fu published three famous articles calling for the resignation of T. V. Soong. Soong resigned some days later due to mounting public pressure. In 1948, Fu attempted suicide but was saved because of the retreat of KMT forces in the civil war. Fu went to Taiwan in the earlier part of 1949. On 20 January 1949, he was appointed President of National Taiwan University. In July, Fu was accused of recruiting faculty members with communist backgrounds. An article published in a local newspaper said that, under Fu's leadership, National Taiwan University had turned into a base for communists. Despite Fu's deep belief in academic freedom, he was forced to compromise his beliefs with the political pressure of the day and fire those scholars alleged to have communist ties.Ê≠êÁ¥†Áëõ„ÄàË≤¢ÁçªÈÄôÂÄãÂ§ßÂ≠∏‰∫éÂÆáÂÆôÁöÑÁ≤æÁ•ûÔºçË´áÂÇÖÊñØÂπ¥ËàáËá∫ÁÅ£Â§ßÂ≠∏Â∏´Ë≥á‰πãÊîπÂñÑ„Äâ In December 1950, Fu died in the Taiwan Representative Council at the age of 55 due to hypertension. Soon after answering questions from assembly member on 20 December, Fu sat down and said to the assembly's secretary-general , \\"I‚Äôm done! I‚Äôm done!\\", and fell. The announcement of Fu's death by interim assembly chairman the next day caused a protest led by NTU students. Lee stated that \\"Fu had left this world\\", but his Hoklo accent made it sound as if Fu had \\"died of anger\\" caused by Kuo's questioning. Legacy Fu Ssu-nien Library The Fu Ssu-nien Library of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica in Taiwan was named in his honor.Institute of History and Philology Fu was known for saying, \\"There are only 21 hours available per day because the remaining three hours are reserved for self-reflection.\\" Scholar Hu Shih said that Fu Ssu-nien is one of the best educators and charismatic leaders of his time.

The collection features eight short stories originally published in pulp magazines between 1935 and 1941. At Chandler's request, the stories remained uncollected during his lifetime and, save for three which were reprinted without his express permission, were not republished until 1964. Contents The collection features eight stories, all but the last predating Chandler's first novel The Big Sleep. They are, with place of original publication: *\\"Killer in the Rain\\" (Black Mask, January 1935) *\\"The Man Who Liked Dogs\\" (Black Mask, March 1936) *\\"The Curtain\\" (Black Mask, September 1936) *\\"Try the Girl\\" (Black Mask, January 1937) *\\"Mandarin's Jade\\" (Dime Detective Magazine, November 1937) *\\"Bay City Blues\\" (Dime Detective Magazine, November 1937) *\\"The Lady in the Lake\\" (Dime Detective Magazine, January 1939) *\\"No Crime in the Mountains\\" (Detective Story Magazine, September 1941) Cannibalization During his lifetime, it was Chandler's personal desire that the stories not be reprinted. This was because he felt that the plots had become cannibalized -- in the process of writing three of his novels, Chandler had borrowed, expanded, and extensively reworked plots, passages, and characters from these eight stories. The Big Sleep made use of \\"The Curtain\\", \\"Killer in the Rain\\", as well as small passages from \\"Finger Man\\". Farewell, My Lovely made use of \\"The Man Who Liked Dogs\\", \\"Try the Girl\\" and \\"Mandarin's Jade\\". The Lady in the Lake made use of the short story of the same name, \\"Bay City Blues\\" and \\"No Crime in the Mountains\\". The opening passage of \\"The Curtain\\" would also be revised and reused for the same function in his sixth novel, The Long Goodbye.

She was mother of Shivaji's second son, Rajamram. She was the younger sister of Maratha army chief Hambirrao Mohite. She was executed in 1681, after she failed to dethrone Sambhaji, the elder son of Shivaji. Early life Born Soyarabai Shirke, she was married to Shivaji at a very young age in 1660.The marriage took place when Shivaji visited his father Shahaji at Bangalore with his mother Jijabai. Tukabai(N√©e Mohite), the stepmother of Shivaji and paternal aunt of Soyarabai insisted on the marriage. After the death of Jijabai in (1674), Soyarabai gained prominence in Shivaji's family and by extension, in the Maratha court politics. Soyrabai bore two children to Shivaji, a daughter Balibai and son Rajaram. After Shivaji's death Many historians blame her for Shivaji's death. She was ambitious and she wanted her son Rajaram to succeed Shivaji instead of the elder son Sambhaji. Sambhaji was not kept informed on the Shivaji's death and he was absent when Shivaji was cremated. After Shivaji's death in 1680, with the help of some of the courtiers, Soyarabai got her ten- year-old son, Rajaram, on the vacant throne. Her stepson and heir presumptive Sambhaji, was able to remove him from power with the help of Soyrabai's own brother and army chief Hambirrao Mohite. He imprisoned courtiers and formally assumed power as the Chhatrapati on July 20, 1680. After Sambhaji seized power from Soyrabai, she tried every means to dethrone him. Soyarabai's henchmen tried to poison Sambhaji in August 1681, but he survived and ordered the execution of Soyarabai. Many plotters including Soyarabai's and Yesubai's relatives from the Shirke family were also executed.

She is said to have been an Irish princess, the sister of Erc of Slane and a student of Saint Baricus. Legend Ia went to the seashore to depart for Cornwall from her native Ireland along with other saints. Finding that they had gone without her, fearing that she was too young for such a hazardous journey, she was grief- stricken and began to pray. As she prayed, she noticed a small leaf floating on the water and touched it with a rod to see if it would sink. As she watched, it grew bigger and bigger. Trusting God, she embarked upon the leaf and was carried across the Irish Sea. She reached Cornwall before the others, where she joined Saint Gwinear and Felec of Cornwall. Legend holds that they had up to 777 companions. She is said to have founded an oratory in a clearing in a wood on the site of the existing Parish Church that is dedicated to her. Ia was martyred under \\"King Teudar\\": R A Ogden, An Unknown Planet?, 2008, Park Corner Press, Warrington, p 41 (i.e., Tewdwr Mawr of Penwith) on the River Hayle and buried at what is now St Ives, where St Ia's Church‚Äîof which she is now the patron saint‚Äîwas erected over her grave.

Founded in 1607 at the bequest of King Karl IX, Skultuna Messingsbruk is located in Skultuna on the outskirts of V√§ster√•s. The logotype of Skultuna consists of the closed royal crown, the name \\"Skultuna\\" and the founding year \\"1607\\". Early history In the year 1607, King Karl IX could at last implement his long held plans for a Swedish brass industry. He had a man sent off on the Crown's business to find a suitable location for a brass foundry. The choice fell on Skultuna, where the Svart√•n brook provided sufficient water power. Charcoal was available here as well, there was a harbor in V√§ster√•s and the copper mine at Falun was also close. Skultuna Messingsbruk was founded and the king's decision confirmed in a letter dated 11 February 1607. The work could proceed. The history of the brass foundry During the time of Gustav Wasa and Erik XIV, Sweden had become indebted to the Hanseatic League. Refining copper into brass would reduce imports of brass and increase income from exports. The work was divided up between different workshops, each one supervised by a master craftsman. The early products consisted mainly of brass plate, chandeliers and candlesticks. Some of these are still designs are still in production like the Office Candlestick and Chandeliers. Near the end of the 19th century Skultuna worked closely with the Swedish designer Carl-Hjalmar Norrstr√∂m who created a number of classic items for Skultuna, among these a baptismal font in brass, copper and silver that won the gold medal at the Stockholm Exhibition in 1897 and the Paris Exhibition in 1900. Present day The production in Skultuna is continuing in an unbroken line since 1607, every year about five hundred chandeliers are built, a couple of thousand candlesticks are mounted and polished, thousands of cuff links are packaged and shipped around the world. Skultuna has two product lines today: Home Accessories and Fashion Accessories. Skultuna is working closely together with some of the world's leading designers like Ilse Crawford, Richard Hutten Claesson Koivisto Rune, Monica F√∂rster and Thomas Sandell. Among the many designers that worked with Skultuna through 1900s Sigvard Bernadotte and Pierre Forssell stands out with their timeless modernism. Royal Warrant Holder to the Swedish Court Skultuna is a Purveyor to the Court of Sweden. Founded in 1607 at the bequest of King Karl IX, Skultuna has been a Royal Warrant Holder to the Swedish court for ages. To qualify for a warrant, the order must come from the royal court and the company must deliver its goods or services to the court.

Controversies Within Mexico in March 2015, an article from the Mexican edition of the Forbes magazine revealed that Cinepolis along its rival movie theater chain Cinemex, were fined $7 million pesos each for directly disobeying instructions by the Intituto Nacional Electoral (INE, National Electoral Institute), by showing political propaganda of the Partido Verde Ecologista de Mexico (Ecologist Green Party of Mexico), with the political party itself being fined $35 million pesos. In 2017, the Del Amor Nace La Vista charity foundation of Cinepolis was criticized for allegedly leaving 100 Mayan indigenous people blind due to negligence. Cinepolis said it was only two, and no negligence was detected within the operations.

Little, Brown) The Million Dollar Shot is a children's story written by Dan Gutman. It is held by over 1100 US and Canadian libraries, according to worldCat. Plot Finkle Foods, a snack company, is holding a contest, with the grand prize being a trip to New York City to take a foul shot at the first National Basketball Association final game that, if made, would give the winner a million dollars. No one needed (or deserved) this money as much as Eddie Ball, a boy who lives in a trailer park in Louisiana with his widowed mother, Rebecca Ball. Rebecca had recently been laid off from Finkle Foods, and Eddie was determined to run George Finkle, the founder, out of business. He entered the contest by writing a rap poem, which was upon hearing it, turned down by his friend and neighbor Annie \\"Annie Oakley Oakley\\" Stokely. Annie wrote another poem, which went: :'How could the pilgrims e'er be contented, :'When savory Finkle's had not been invented?' Annie's poem won the contest, though Eddie took credit for it. With the help of Annie's father, Bobby Stokely, Eddie trained long and hard to make the million dollar shot in June. Not everyone was in Eddie's favor, however. George Finkle himself tried to bribe Eddie to miss the shot, offering him his mother's job back and all the Finkles he could eat, but Eddie declined. He knew Finkle had been spying on him while practicing and thus knew how good he was at shooting. Eddie arrived in New York City for the game and, under monumental pressure, made the shot and received the one million dollars. As it turned out, Finkles caused cancer and Finkle Foods was shut down by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the next day. Eddie bought the company with his prize money and, with the help of his mother and the Stokelys, created the Air Ball Company, with the main product being the Air Ball Crunchy, a snack of his mother's invention originally shot down by Finkle Foods. The Air Ball Company's motto was: :'How could the pilgrims e'er be contented,' :'When Air Ball Crunchies had not been invented?'

Headquartered near Seattle in the city of Bellevue, Washington, the channel broadcasts regional coverage of sports events throughout the Pacific Northwest, with a focus on professional sports teams based in Seattle and Portland. It is available on cable providers throughout Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska and nationwide on satellite via DirecTV and Dish Network. History Root Sports Northwest was launched in late 1988 as Northwest Cable Sports, a network owned by King Broadcasting Company. In 1991, King Broadcasting sold Northwest Cable Sports and its other media properties to The Providence Journal Company, which sold the network to Liberty Media in 1992. Liberty integrated Northwest Cable Sports into its Prime Network group of regional sports networks, subsequently rebranding it as Prime Sports Northwest. In 1996, News Corporation, which formed a sports division for the Fox network two years earlier after it obtained the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference and sought to create a group of regional sports networks, acquired a 50% interest in the Prime Network from Liberty. Later that year on November 1, News Corporation and Liberty Media relaunched the Prime Network affiliates as part of the new Fox Sports Net group, with the Seattle-based network officially rebranding as Fox Sports Northwest. The channel was rebranded as Fox Sports Net Northwest in 2000, as part of a collective brand modification of the FSN networks under the \\"Fox Sports Net\\" banner. Subsequently, in 2004, the channel shortened its name to FSN Northwest, through the networks' de-emphasis of the \\"Fox Sports Net\\" brand. On December 22, 2006, News Corporation sold its interest in FSN Northwest and sister networks FSN Utah, FSN Pittsburgh and FSN Rocky Mountain to Liberty Media, in an asset trade in which News Corporation also 16.3% traded its 38.5% ownership stake in satellite provider DirecTV for $550 million in cash and stock, in exchange for Liberty Media's stake in the company. On May 4, 2009, DirecTV Group Inc. announced it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off into the separate company under the DirecTV name, in a deal in which Liberty would increase its share in DirecTV from 48% to 54%, with Liberty owner John Malone and his family owning a 24% interest. DirecTV would operate its newly acquired FSN-affiliated networks through DirecTV Sports Networks, a new division formed when the split off from Liberty Media was completed on November 19, 2009. On December 17, 2010, DirecTV Sports Networks announced that its four Fox Sports Networks-affiliated regional outlets would be relaunched under the \\"Root Sports\\" brand. The network officially rebranded as Root Sports Northwest on April 1, 2011, with The Dan Patrick Show as the first program under the new Root Sports branding. For nominal purposes, the Root Sports networks continued to carry programming distributed mainly to the Fox Sports regional networks to provide supplementary sports and entertainment programming. In April 2013, the Seattle Mariners announced that they would acquire controlling interest in Root Sports Northwest, as part of a long-term extension of its contract with the team through the 2030 season. DirecTV remained a minority stakeholder and controlling partner, and the network continued to operate under the Root Sports brand. DirecTV was subsequently acquired by AT&T; on July 14, 2017, its sister networks were re-branded as AT&T; SportsNet. Root Sports Northwest did not adopt the AT&T; SportsNet brand, likely because AT&T; is not the majority owner of the service. Nonetheless, Root Sports still introduced a rebranded version of AT&T; SportsNet's new on-air graphics.

It is one of the Berlin State Museums institutions and is funded by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. It houses some 20,000 Asian artifacts, making it one of the largest museums of ancient Asian art in the world. The museum is located in the same building as the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. The museum houses important collections of Art houses of South, Southeast and Central Asian countries and art from the Indo-Asian cultural area, from the 4th millennium BC to the present. Its geographic reach covers regions in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Autonomous Region of Tibet and Xinjiang of the People's Republic of China, the Southeast Asian countries of Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and also the Indonesian Islands or archipelago. History The collection originally belonged to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin founded in 1873. From 1904 it was known as the \\"Indian Department\\". Uyghur Princes wearing Chinese-styled robes and headgear. Bezeklik, Cave 9, 9-12th century CE, wall painting, 62.4 x 59.5 cm. On November 8, 1906, by government decree, Wilhelm von Bode, director-general of the Royal Museums of Berlin, founded the collection of the Museum of East Asian Art in Berlin. Germany's oldest museum of its kind, it was first located on Museum Island. As a result of the four German Turfan expeditions, from 1902 to 1914, the collection was expanded to include Central Asia. In 1924, the exhibition was moved into the building belonging to the Arts and Crafts Museum, which at that time was also home to the Museum of Pre- and Early History (since 1981, it has been known as Martin-Gropius-Bau). The Society for East Asian Art founded in 1926 has provided substantial support for the museum's work. Thanks to their consistent expansion until the Second World War, the collections were among the most important in the world. During the Second World War, there were regrettable losses, partly due to damage to the museum building and partly to the removal of a large number of artifacts to Russia. After the war, the Red Army took about 90 percent of the distributed collections to the Soviet Union as war booty. There they were taken to the Hermitage in St Petersburg where they have remained until today. Only a few pieces were returned to Berlin. The almost complete loss necessitated recreating the collection but this could only be achieved gradually. From 1952, it was the Pergamon Museum that exhibited East Asian Art. At the instigation of the first director, Herbert H√§rtel, the collections were presented as part of an independent \\"Indian Art Department\\", later called the \\"Museum of Indian Art\\" (from 1 January 1963 to 4 December 2006). After the Berlin Wall went up, it was decided in 1970 to build new exhibition premises in West Berlin in the Zehlendorf district. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, efforts were made to reorganize Berlin's museum scene. In 1992, the two separate collections were brought together in Dahlem. The Association of Friends of the Department, the Society of Indo-Asian Art Berlin eV, was founded in 1993. It publishes the annual Indo-Asiatische Zeitschrift (\\"Indo-Asian Journal\\"). In 2000, they were extended, forming until 2006 the Museum of East Asian Art, which now continues as the East Asian Art Collection at the Museum of Asian Art, since December 2006 Collection The collection covers the art of all of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia, with special focus on sculpture (south and southeast Asia) and murals (central Asia). The artifacts date from the third millennium BC to the present day. The permanent exhibition contains stone, bronze, stucco and ceramic sculptures and stone reliefs with Hindu, Buddhist and Jain subjects as well as murals, clay sculptures and textiles from Buddhist complexes on the northern Silk Road (now Xinjiang, PR China), and Indian miniatures and craftwork from the Islamic Mughal period. Sculptures of stone, bronze and wood, as well as ritual objects from Nepal, Tibet, Burma, and southeast Asia complete coverage of the Indo-Asian region. Special sections include the Gandhara Art Collection (Pakistan and Afghanistan, 1st-5th centuries) and a replica of a Central Asian Buddhist cave with a large section of the original. The Gandhara art displays include artifacts from the Swat Valley. The museum, with an outstanding collection of some 20,000 artifacts, has example of stone sculptures, reliefs, bronze and terracotta works representative of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Much of its collection of Jain art and Hindu sculpture dates to the classic period or the Middle Ages, and the museum also contains reconstruction of Indian temples. The East Asian Art Collection houses the largest and most important collection of Chinese, Korean and Japanese art in Germany. It consists of some 13,000 artefacts from all cultural periods, from the Neolithic to the present day. The three countries of the Asian subcontinent are first presented separately in their own departments. Their galleries converge on a central hall exhibiting the art of Buddhism, a common element in all three cultures. The Chinese Department has a large exhibition of porcelain, considerably enriched by Georg Weishaupt's collection, as well as lacquerware. Over 3,000-year-old bronzes, jades and ceramics attest to the country's early civilization and culture. A porcelain cup from the Wanli Emperor's time (1573‚Äì1620) during the Ming dynasty is of outstanding cultural and historical significance. In a separate room, a 17th-century traveling throne belonging to the Kangxi Emperor is exhibited. Its unique rosewood screen has rich pearl inlays with decorations of gold and lacquerwork. With selected examples its China-Japan gallery, the museum presents the art of writing, common to all areas of East Asian art. As many works of Chinese and Japanese writing and some of the old paintings are particularly sensitive to light, they are exhibited for periods of three months before being replaced. The same applies to many items of lacquerwork and textile art. However, as a result of ties with Japanese woodcuts and the museum's important graphic collection, new relationships and priorities constantly emerge. In the Japanese department, visitors are shown a Japanese tea room or Boki. A study collection offers interested museum visitors the opportunity to experience an in-depth insight into the collection. A central repository for the collections is being planned in Berlin Friedrichshagen. Services By appointment the Japanese tea ceremony can be observed. A reference library is open exclusively to experts. An interactive computer program and alternating short films complement the presentation. The courtyard, which can be reached from the basement, presents a stone copy of the east gate of the famous Stupa I from Sanchi in central India. Associations A tradition of close cooperation exists with the German Society for East Asian Art, one of the museum's two supporting associations. At an international level, the museum cooperates with various non-European art museums, as well as with the Museum Rietberg in Z√ºrich and the Mus√©e Guimet in Paris . In the scientific field, the South, Southeast and Central Asia Collection and the East Asian Art Collection are closely connected with the neighboring Free University of Berlin. For example, museum director Willibald Veit is also Professor of East Asian Art History at the University. The merger of the two museums has been done with a future expansion plans of the \\"Stiftung Preu√üischer Kulturbesitz\\" and to establish the Humboldt-Forum on Schlossplatz in Berlin-Mitte, a new concept venue for unique European collections.

The film debuted at the Hamptons International Film Festival on October 17, 2007. Plot Turn the River stars Famke Janssen as Kailey Sullivan, a woman rough around the edges and schooled in hard knocks. Divorced from her son's father and without visitation rights, she and her son write letters to each other and meet surreptitiously. Kailey learns that her son, Gulley, is being abused by his father and is being bullied in school. She decides that the best thing for her and her child would be to leave the country and start a new life in Canada. She puts a plan into motion to organize fake passports and papers, which require that she raise a fair amount of money. Kailey starts off by using her exceptional skills at pool to win small bets. After a nasty encounter with a player unhappy at losing, Kailey reveals to her friend Teddy Quinette that she met her ex-husband, David, while she was running an illegal card game room. David left his studies in a seminary to marry a then pregnant Kailey. David's mother, staunchly religious and unhappy at this turn of events, reported Kailey's illegal activities and then struck a deal with her to make her life easier in return for Kailey getting a divorce and giving away custody of Gulley. With Teddy's help, Kailey begins to organise high-stakes games against skilled players at the pool bar Teddy owns. Kailey eventually collects enough money and prepares to flee with her son in tow. On the morning of departure, she drops by David's house to speak to him for the first time in eleven years. She tells him that she is leaving with Gulley and that he will be better off with her. Kailey then handcuffs David inside the house with the aid of a replica handgun. David's wife returns to find him, and they call the police. After driving to the Canada‚ÄìUS border, Kailey and Gulley have only to catch an early morning bus over the border. The police manage to track them down before they can leave, and Kailey is shot by police who believed her to be reaching for a firearm in her bag. It is left to the viewer to decide if she died or not. The movie ends with a flashback of Gulley walking to Quinette's pool bar for the first time to receive a postcard from his mother.

Dunalastair was the home of the Clan Donnachaidh of Scotland, which includes names such as Robertson, Duncan and Reid. This family lived there until the 1850s, and there is a burial ground of the chiefs of Clan Donnachaidh in the grounds. There is the ruin of an old baronial-style mansion in the grounds, built in 1862 by General Macdonald, the then-owner of Dunalastair. The original tower house was burnt down after the 1745 rebellion, as the great chieftain Alexander Robertson of Struan was a Jacobite supporter. Another house built on the site was demolished by General Macdonald in order to build the current building. The estate is overlooked by the peak of Schiehallion, a conical mountain sometimes translated as \\"Fairy hill of the Caledonians\\".

He wrote it in his diary entry for 4 March 1917. The poem is written about how the staff officers of the British Army (referred to as scarlet majors) send soldiers off to the war front to be killed, while they stay at the Base \\"Guzzling and gulping in the best hotel\\" and sending \\"glum heroes up the line to death\\". Like Sassoon's many other poems, \\"Base Details\\" is bitterly sarcastic and derisive of the comfortable establishment that supported the continuation of the war while showing little concern for the people who suffered its consequences. It took place during World War I in France around 1914-1918. The theme is anger and bitterness. It expresses anger to those who start wars and send their fellow men to their death. The main message is that army officers plan battles from safety of their base, and are usually not involved in the fighting, and therefore does not know the horrors that they are forcing soldiers to face. The first two quartiles are talking about the Majors, in a very sarcastic way, and the last couplet talks about how the war isn't actually a joke, that it is very serious. Analysis The major in this poem is cynical, he treats war as if it is a game. 'last scrap.' The major knows nothing of war because he has never been on the frontline. The major is a figure associated with power and privilege. Also, he knows that the meaning of the \\"last scrap\\" is how the major thinks of war, a game. The title of the poem \\"Base Details\\"- Base possibly meaning a military base and Details could be a command assignment, someone or something lowly. \\"fierce; and bald, and short of breath\\" this would be a stereotypical World War I officer. \\"Glum heroes\\" refer to the heroes by dying they are unhappy. \\"Up the line\\" is the battlefield. \\"puffy petulant face\\" is the officer's faces from the excessive eating and drinking. \\"Guzzling and gulping in the best hotel\\": The officers eat and drink until their hearts delight while the best hotel refers to them living in the lap of luxury. This also could portray them as acting like monsters and this is what Sassoon intended. In the second line is the phrase \\"scarlet major\\" which is possibly a double entendre . Scarlet (red) has several different meanings. One reference is to the red tabs that staff officers wore on the lapels of their dress uniforms. These denoted them as non-regimental officers that would never see actual fighting, but work safely in the rear headquarters. Another reference is to the red blood on their hands from knowing that they have killed all these people by sending them to the front line. It could also imply that their faces are red from being drunk or that they are very childish, which implies they are ignorant and will do anything to get what they want. Also their faces might be red because they are so obese and they are out of breath from doing nothing. \\"Poor Young Chap\\" this direct speech can be interpreted as that it mimics the Majors as they pretend to care, to get the public on their side, said almost as a matter of routine. The term \\"Scrap\\" can refer to the generals and Majors referring to the war as a game, or \\"scrap\\". \\"Youth stone dead\\" a very blunt metaphor which shows the harshness of the author, who isn't impressed. The last two lines however show how the war is not just a game, and how young boys are being slaughtered for small sections of land that should not be valued the same as people's lives. \\"Toddle\\" refers to the drunk Major and a very good use of satire as it is effective in diminishing the normal view of a major, and \\"Die\\" is what Siegfried wants the major to do. Siegfried Sassoon shows great disgust towards military majors. He is appalled at the way the majors act while men are dying in the battlefield. The majors are fat, insensitive, greedy, vain and very proud, and display no empathy with the soldiers whatsoever. The use of iambic pentameter and a regular rhyming scheme help create a tone of sarcasm. As the topic is serious such an upbeat rhythm would normally, seem inappropriate except that Sassoon skillfully employs the techniques to satirize the complacent attitude of majors who never have to face the horror of war.

It is unlike the modern way of writing Luise√±o.Haas, Preface, p. xv Tac also wrote an essay on the \\"Conversion of the San Luise√±os of Alta California.\\" The latter includes information on aboriginal lifeways (including dances and games) and the history and organization of the Mission, along with two drawings by Tac. Tac authored an early account of life at Mission San Luis Rey entitled Indian Life and Customs at Mission San Luis Rey: A Record of California Mission Life by Pablo Tac, An Indian Neophyte (written circa 1835, edited and translated by Minna Hewes and Gordon Hewes in 1958). In the book, Tac lamented the rapid decline of his people: > In Quechla not long ago there were 5,000 souls, with all their neighboring > lands. Through a sickness that came to California 2,000 souls died, and > 3,000 were left.\\" Lightfoot, p. 108 Tac went on to describe the preferential treatment the padres received: > In the mission of San Luis Rey de Francia the Fernandino [sic] father is > like a king. He has his pages, alcaldes, majordomos, musicians, soldiers, > gardens, ranchos, livestock....\\" Lightfoot, p. 105 Tac also noted that his people initially attempted to bar the Spaniards from their southern California homelands. When the foreign invaders approached, > \\"...the chief stood up...and met them,\\" demanding, \\"...what are you looking > for? Leave our country!\\" Commemorations For the 2005 Venice Biennale, Luise√±o artist James Luna created an artwork dedicated to the memory of Pablo Tac. The piece, titled Emendatio, included three installations, Spinning Woman, Apparitions: Past and Present, and The Chapel for Pablo Tac, as well as a personal performance in Venice, Renewal.Nottage, 25 It was sponsored by the National Museum of the American Indian.McFadden and Taubman, 248 In July 2019, author Christian Clifford presented the workshop \\"Pablo Tac: Indian from the far shores of California\\" in Ohio at the 80th annual Tekakwitha Conference, a Catholic Native American organization.Peter Jesserer SmithRedacci√≥n ACI Prensa See also *Population of Native California *List of Native American artists *Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas Notes References  * McFadden, David Revere and Ellen Napiura Taubman.

He attended Ashland High School and was a good student and a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, Sixkiller was an All-Southern Oregon Conference selection and a second team all-state selection. He was a back-up at quarterback as a sophomore to senior Gene Willis, who later played at Washington. In basketball, he was an all- conference selection. In baseball, he was a pitcher and an all-conference selection. Sixkiller graduated in 1969 and had hoped to stay in-state and play for Oregon State in Corvallis, but head coach Dee Andros declined to offer him a scholarship, wary of his short stature (, ). University of Washington On the advice of Willis, head coach Jim Owens recruited Sixkiller and offered him a scholarship to the University of Washington in Seattle. Due to his name, he was given uniform number 6. Sixkiller became the starting quarterback for the Huskies as a sophomore in 1970, and led the Huskies to a record, a vast improvement over the record in 1969. He completed 186 passes for 2,303 yards and 15 touchdowns in what many called the Year of The Quarterback, in which Jim Plunkett of Stanford passed for 2,715 yards on the year and broke his own conference record. Plunkett won the Heisman Trophy in 1970, beating out Notre Dame's Joe Theismann and Archie Manning of Ole Miss.

He was among the founders of the Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I) in 1921. Biography Born in Luzzara (Emilia-Romagna), Fortichiari began his activity as a journalist and socialist activist at an early age, and, in the early 1910s, he met Amadeo Bordiga. In December 1912 he was appointed responsible of the Milanese section of the Italian Socialist Party. He was the author of the order that expelled the pro-National Syndicalist and future Fascist ruler Benito Mussolini from the party in 1914, and, in contrast to Mussolini, was among the foremost opponents in first line to protest against the Italian intervention in World War I. After the war he was instrumental to all the events the led to the founding of the PCd'I in Livorno (January 21, 1921). He was a member of the executive committee of the new grouping, together with Bordiga, Ruggero Grieco, Luigi Repossi and Umberto Terracini, with responsibility for the illegal activities against the increasing success of Fascist forces in repressing left-wing forces. He was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1924. When all the Italian Communist deputies were arrested (November 8, 1926), Fortichiari was sentenced to five years of internment, but he was released after one year for being affected by tuberculosis. He moved to Milan, but here he met difficulties to find a regular job, which were aggravated by his expulsion from the PCI in 1929. During World War II, he entered in contact with members of the Internationalist Communist Party, a group led by ex-PCI members who disagreed with the moderate politics of the party in opposition to Comintern demands. Despite the PCI's campaign against him, Fortichiari was readmitted in its ranks after the war, although he held secondary positions and was under a strict control of the party cadres, who were arguably weary of his intact charisma as the main figure inside an anti-Stalinist current. In 1956, he was again expelled from PCI. He remained active until his death, apart a hiatus in 1965-1970, trying to collect the dissension against the party's official doctrine in the communist left movement. Fortichiari died in Milan.

Background The producer of \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\", Abner Spector, was an A&R; man for the Chicago-based Chess Records. Spector was responsible for The Corsairs' 1962 number 12 hit \\"Smoky Places\\", which had been released on Tuff, a subsidiary of J&S; Records. In the summer of 1963, Spector asked J&S; owner, Zelma \\"Zell\\" Sanders, to assemble a vocal ensemble to record a girl group style record, to which end Sanders wrote the song \\"Sally...\\" with Spector's wife Lona Stevens, drawing inspiration from the nursery rhyme \\"Ring around the Rosie\\". The songwriting copyright for \\"Sally...\\" is now in the name of Abner Spector who died in 2010; Zell Sanders died in 1976. The arrangement for \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" was provided by Artie Butler, who recalls Spector \\"asked me to listen to [the] song...[I] decided that in its present form it did not [have potential], but I heard something in my head. He said, 'Go into a small demo studio and do what you hear', and he would pay for it.\\" Butler says that he prepped the backing track for \\"Sally...\\" at Broadway Recording Studios in the Ed Sullivan Theater; in spite of it being widely reported that Buddy Miles is the drummer, Butler claims that, except for the guitar parts (by Al Gorgoni and Carl Lynch), he played all the instruments on the track. Butler states the entire recording of \\"Sally...\\" was done \\"on an old Ampex tape machine at 7 IPS mono....Each time when I added another element\\" ‚Äì including the final element: the vocalists ‚Äì \\"I added a different type of reverb. Each generation [ie. development] seemed to add to the distinct sound of the record.\\" Besides the five vocalists credited in the group which Zell Sanders assembled to record \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" (Yvonne Bushnell, Ethel Davis (aka Vernell Hill), Ada Ray Kelly, Johnnie Louise Richardson and Mary Sue Wells (aka Mary Sue Wellington/Mary Green Wilson)), at least five other vocalists are known to be featured on the track: Selena Healey, Marie Hood, Marlene Jenkins (aka Marlina Mack/Marlina Mars), Louise Harris Murray, Lezli Valentine and Iggy Williams have been identified as participating in the recording sessions for \\"Sally...\\". The recording sessions took place over a week, running up of costs of $60,000, then an exorbitant amount of time and money for a single track. According to Johnnie Louise Richardson: \\"Anybody that came in the studio that week, [Spector] would put them on [the track]. Originally, I think he had about 20 voices on 'Sally.'\\" Butler's recollection is that Spector only heard the \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" track when it was completed and \\"hated it. He was really angry. He felt that I wasted his money.\\" Butler played the track for Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who offered to buy it from Spector: the interest of the duo caused Spector to reassess \\"Sally...\\", which he had Sanders release as a single credited to 'the Jaynetts', with the instrumental track as the B-side. Butler claimed his only return for arranging \\"Sally...\\" was being credited as the arranger on the record: a 1971 Billboard article states that Butler's arrangement of \\"Sally...\\" did earn him $3.Billboard vol 83 #45 (6 Nov 1971) page 20 The recording engineer of \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" was John P. \\"Jack\\" Sullivan. Reception \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" had its first major market breakout in San Francisco, its ringing arrangement being a precursor of the San Francisco Sound. The song was a favorite number of Grace Slick when she fronted the Great Society, her pre-Jefferson Airplane outfit, and it was a formative influence on Laura Nyro. \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated 28 September 1963, remaining at number 2 on the Hot 100 dated 5 October, both weeks kept out of the top slot by \\"Blue Velvet\\" by Bobby Vinton. On the Music Vendor Top 40 dated 12 October 1963, \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" was ranked at number 1. In the Cash Box Top 100, it reached the number 3 spot on 28 September 1963, its highest position; it remained there for another week (5 October 1963). It was also a hit in France, reaching number 7 with a 17-week chart run, and reached number 2 in New Zealand. Tuff released a Sally Go 'Round the Roses album which, despite the group being promoted as a quintet, displayed a cover image of a trio, only two of whom, Ethel Davis and Lezli Valentine, are identifiable. Besides the title cut, in both vocal and instrumental versions, and the follow-up single \\"Keep an Eye on Her\\", the album featured \\"Archie's Melody\\", \\"Bongo Bobby\\", \\"I Wanna Know\\", \\"No Love at All\\", \\"One Track Mind\\", \\"Pick Up My Marbles\\", \\"School Days\\" and \\"See Saw\\". Also featured as 'a special guest appearance' was \\"Dear Abby\\", credited to the Hearts, a minor hit (number 94) recorded by at least some of the same personnel who were involved with \\"Sally...\\". Billboard placed the song at number 78 on its list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. Interpretations \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" was unlike other pop songs of the day, with a spooky, even ominous, musical ambiance heightened by the sometimes odd and opaque lyrics, which gave the song a mysterious feeling that probably accounted in part for its popularity, and which has led to speculation on the meaning of the song. \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" could be interpreted as a conventional song of heartbreak over cheating, or it could be ‚Äì and has been ‚Äì seen as alluding to deeper matters, including drug use, illegitimate motherhood, madness, suicide, or, most especially, lesbianism. Tim Buckley builds on this latter notion on his song \\"Sally, Go 'Round the Roses\\" from his 1973 album Sefronia. Although the song contains many new lyrics not in the original (and credits only Buckley as the songwriter), it begins with a version of Sanders' song but with the lyric \\"Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown; saddest thing in the whole wide world is to see your baby with another girl\\" replaced with \\"Oh Sally don't you go down, oh darlin' don't you go downtown; Honey the saddest thing in the whole wide world is to find your woman been with another girl\\". Other versions A 1966 performance of the song by Grace Slick is featured on Conspicuous Only in its Absence, the Great Society's live album released in 1968. The recording was released as a single by Columbia Records in 1968 and got some Top 40 airplay but failed to chart. In the UK, where the Jaynetts' single had a non-charting 1963 release on Stateside Records, \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\" was first covered by Lyn Cornell, which had an October 1963 release on Decca: this version also failed to chart as did later covers by the Remo Four in May 1964, and Dee King in April 1966, both on Piccadilly Records. \\"Sally...\\" would gain its highest UK profile when recorded by Pentangle in 1969, for their hit album Basket of Light; \\"Sally...\\" was employed as B-side for the 1970 US single release of the Basket of Light track, \\"Light Flight\\", which had charted in the UK but with a different B-side (\\"Cold Mountain\\").

His primary interests include philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, metaphysics and epistemology. His current work involves the philosophy of linguistics, foundational issues in semantics, the semantics of definite descriptions and demonstratives, semantic externalism, and scientific realism. Education Devitt's secondary education (1952-1957) was at Bradfield College in Berkshire, England, where he completed 3 \\"A\\" Levels and 9 \\"O\\" Levels. He then studied at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia between 1958-1961, taking his qualifying exam at the end of that time. His higher education began at the University of Sydney in 1962, where he studied philosophy and psychology. He graduated in 1966 with First Class Honours and a University Medal in philosophy. He continued on as a post-graduate research student until 1967, when he moved to Harvard University and studied under Quine. He received his MA in 1970 and his PhD in 1972. Academic positions Following the completion of his coursework at Harvard, Michael Devitt returned to Sydney in 1971 and began his teaching career as a lecturer in the Philosophy department. He was prominent in the 'Sydney philosophy disturbances'.The Sydney Philosophy Disturbances He was made a senior lecturer in 1977 and Associate Professor in 1982, and by 1985 was named as Head of Department of Traditional and Modern Philosophy. He continued teaching at the University of Sydney until 1987, after which he returned to the United States and accepted an appointment of Professor of Philosophy at the University of Maryland in 1988. He remained in Maryland until 1999, when he became a Professor (later Distinguished Professor) at the CUNY Graduate Center. There he served as the Executive Officer of the Philosophy Program from 1999-2002\\\\. He continues to teach there as a Distinguished Professor as of 2012. In addition to his tenured or tenure-track positions, Michael Devitt has held numerous non-tenured positions at the University of Nottingham, Macquarie University, Australian National University, Victoria University of Wellington, University of Michigan, University of Southern California, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Harvard University, and The Women's College, University of Sydney. Philosophical work Devitt is a noted proponent of the causal theory of reference. He claims that repeated groundings in an object can account for reference change. However, such a response leaves open the problem of cognitive significance that originally intrigued Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege. Devitt, along with Georges Rey, is also a critic of the transcendental argument against eliminativism, and defends this position against claims that it is self-refuting by invoking deflationary semantic theories that avoid analysing predicates like \\"x is true\\" as expressing a real property. They are construed, instead, as logical devices so that asserting that a sentence is true is just a quoted way of asserting the sentence itself. To say, \\"'God exists' is true\\" is just to say, \\"God exists\\". This way, Rey and Devitt argue, in so far as dispositional replacements of \\"claims\\" and deflationary accounts of \\"true\\" are coherent, eliminativism is not self-refuting.Devitt, M. & Rey, G.

She served during the French Revolutionary Wars, but her career ended after just four years in service when she was wrecked on the Haak sands off the Dutch coast. Construction Apollo was ordered on 28 March 1793 and was laid down that month at the yards of John Perry & Hanket, at Blackwall. She was launched on 18 March 1794 and was completed at Woolwich Dockyard on 23 September 1794. She cost ¬£13,577 to build; this rising to a total of ¬£20,779 when the cost of fitting her for service was included. Career Apollo was launched in March 1794 and commissioned in August under her first commander, Captain John Manley. Her career began inauspiciously, when Manley accidentally ran her aground on sandbanks in the mouth of the Wash in late 1794. On Manley's orders the ship was lightened by the disposal over the side of her stores and several of her guns, after which she floated free of the sand. Her rudder had broken in the process, and after some difficulty she was sailed to Great Yarmouth for repairs.Grocott 1997, p.13 In June 1796, she and captured the French corvette L√©g√®re, of twenty-two 9-pounder guns and 168 men. L√©g√®re had left Brest on 4 June in company with three frigates. During her cruise she had captured six prizes. However, on 23 June she encountered the two British frigates at . After a 10-hour chase the British frigates finally caught up with her; a few shots were exchanged and then L√©g√®re struck. The Navy took into her service as HMS Legere.Winfield (2008), p.255. Then in December, Apollo and were off the Irish coast when they captured the 14-gun French privateer schooner , of 100 tons bm and 80 men. The Royal Navy took her into service under her existing name. In 1798 Captain Peter Halkett was appointed to the command of Apollo. Apollo shared with , , and the hired armed cutter Rose om the proceeds from the capture on 13 May of the Houismon, Welfart, and Ouldst Kendt. Fate An accident at sea in late 1798 forced Apollo back to port in Great Yarmouth and left her with a depleted crew. A capstan pawl, or crossbar, had broken while the crew were raising the anchor, and the weight of the anchor and chain caused the remaining pawls to turn sharply as the anchor ran back out. Around thirty men were injured after being struck by the pawls.Grocott 1997, p67 Halkett gave orders for a prompt return to port, where the injured men were discharged from Apollos service and entrusted to local medical care. The ship then put back to sea on 5 January, without replacing the injured crew. Halkett's orders were to take Apollo to a point off the coast of Holland, and there to seek out Dutch vessels for capture. One such vessel was sighted on 6 January, and Apollo was turned to give chase. The pursuit was hampered by thick fog, and at 7am on the following morning Apollo ran aground on the Haak Sandbank adjacent to Texel. Halkett ordered that the ship's stores and guns be thrown overboard in order to lighten her and float her free, but despite these efforts she remained stuck fast in the sands. In the late afternoon, a Prussian galliot was sighted and hailed by Apollos crew. After some negotiation, the Prussian captain agreed to jettison the bulk of his cargo of wines and take 250 of Apollos crew back to England. The remaining crew members went aboard Apollos cutter with plans to make their own way to port. By 9pm all crew members had left the British ship, which was then abandoned to the tides. The Prussian ship reached Yarmouth on 11 January, followed three days later by the cutter. A Royal Navy court martial was established to examine the reasons for the loss of the ship. Apollos pilot, John Bruce was found to have shown \\"great want of skill\\" in the execution of his duties, and he was dismissed forthwith from naval service.Hepper 1994, p.90 No findings were made against Captain Halkett, who returned to the Navy at his previous rank and was granted command of a newly completed 36-gun frigate, also named .Winfield (2008), p.155.

They are native to the Indomalayan and Afrotropical realms. Taxonomy and systematics = Phylogeny = The genus Ploceus was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1816. The type species was subsequently designated as the baya weaver. The genus name is from Ancient Greek œÄŒªŒøŒ∫ŒµœÖœÇ plokeus meaning \\"weaver\\", and is derived from the Greek word œÄŒªŒµŒ∫œâ plek≈ç \\"to entwine\\". Based on recent DNA-analysis, the genus Ploceus is almost certainly polyphyletic. If all species currently included in the genus would remain and the genus would be made monophyletic, it would have to encompass the entire subfamily Ploceinae. The Ploceinae can be divided into two groups. In the first group, the widowbirds and bishops (genus Euplectes) are sister to a clade in which the genera Foudia and Quelea are closest relatives and which further includes the Asiatic species of Ploceus, i.e. P. manyar, P. philippinus, P. benghalensis, P. megarhynchus, (and P. hypoxanthus, although untested). Since Georges Cuvier picked P. philippinus as the type species, these five species would logically remain assigned to the genus Ploceus. Basic to the second group is a clade consisting of both species so far included in Ploceus that live on Madagascar, P. nelicourvi and P. sakalava, and these are morphologically very distinct from the remaining species. These two species could in future be assigned to the genus Nelicurvius that was erected by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850, but which was merged with Ploceus later on. This second group further contains the genera Malimbus and Anaplectes, and all remaining Ploceus species. As Malimbus is the earlier name, erected by Vieillot et al. in 1805, the remaining species of Ploceus, as well as Anaplectes rubiceps, could in future be assigned to Malimbus. These changes are largely corroborated by morphological revisions. Provided that the other genera that have not been proposed to be merged into an extended \\"Malimbus\\" are monophyletic, the following (incomplete) tree expresses current insights. =Species list= Speke's weaver (Ploceus spekei, below) and village weaver (Ploceus cucullatus subsp. nigriceps) The genus contains 64 species. * Baglafecht weaver (Ploceus baglafecht) * Bannerman's weaver (Ploceus bannermani) * Bates's weaver (Ploceus batesi) * Black-chinned weaver (Ploceus nigrimentus) * Bertram's weaver (Ploceus bertrandi) * Slender- billed weaver (Ploceus pelzelni) * Loango weaver (Ploceus subpersonatus) * Little weaver (Ploceus luteo) * Spectacled weaver (Ploceus ocularis) * Black- necked weaver (Ploceus nigricollis) * Strange weaver (Ploceus alienus) * Black-billed weaver (Ploceus melanogaster) * Cape weaver (Ploceus capensis) * Bocage's weaver (Ploceus temporalis) * Eastern golden weaver (Ploceus subaureus) * Holub's golden weaver (Ploceus xanthops) * Orange weaver (Ploceus aurantius) * Heuglin's masked weaver (Ploceus heuglini) * Golden palm weaver (Ploceus bojeri) * Taveta weaver (Ploceus castaneiceps) * Pr√≠ncipe weaver (Ploceus princeps) * Northern brown-throated weaver (Ploceus castanops) * Southern brown-throated weaver (Ploceus xanthopterus) * Kilombero weaver (Ploceus burnieri) * R√ºppell's weaver (Ploceus galbula) * Northern masked weaver (Ploceus taeniopterus) * Lesser masked weaver (Ploceus intermedius) * Southern masked weaver (Ploceus velatus) * Katanga masked weaver (Ploceus katangae) * Lufira masked weaver (Ploceus ruweti) * Tanzanian masked weaver (Ploceus reichardi) * Vitelline masked weaver (Ploceus vitellinus) * Speke's weaver (Ploceus spekei) * Fox's weaver (Ploceus spekeoides) * Village weaver (Ploceus cucullatus) * Giant weaver (Ploceus grandis) * Vieillot's black weaver (Ploceus nigerrimus) * Weyns's weaver (Ploceus weynsi) * Clarke's weaver (Ploceus golandi) * Juba weaver (Ploceus dichrocephalus) * Black-headed weaver (Ploceus melanocephalus) * Golden-backed weaver (Ploceus jacksoni) * Cinnamon weaver (Ploceus badius) * Chestnut weaver (Ploceus rubiginosus) * Golden-naped weaver (Ploceus aureonucha) * Yellow-mantled weaver (Ploceus tricolor) * Maxwell's black weaver (Ploceus albinucha) * Nelicourvi weaver (Ploceus nelicourvi) * Sakalava weaver (Ploceus sakalava) * Asian golden weaver (Ploceus hypoxanthus) * Compact weaver (Ploceus superciliosus) * Black- breasted weaver (Ploceus benghalensis) * Streaked weaver (Ploceus manyar) * Baya weaver (Ploceus philippinus) * Finn's weaver (Ploceus megarhynchus) * Dark-backed weaver (Ploceus bicolor) * Preuss's weaver (Ploceus preussi) * Yellow-capped weaver (Ploceus dorsomaculatus) * Olive-headed weaver (Ploceus olivaceiceps) * Usambara weaver (Ploceus nicolli) * Brown-capped weaver (Ploceus insignis) * Bar-winged weaver (Ploceus angolensis) * S√£o Tom√© weaver (Ploceus sanctithomae) * Yellow-legged weaver (Ploceus flavipes) References External links Category:Ploceidae Category:Bird genera ","title":"Ploceus"},{"id":"7681743","text":"The California Cup Distaff is an American thoroughbred horse race run annually at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California during its Oak Tree Racing Association meet in the fall of the year. as a downhill turf event over a distance of six and one-half furlongs on the grass and is open to fillies and mares three-years-old and up bred in the state of California.

Paul Taubman provided the show's live music. Contestants tried to find objects hidden on an electronic board by tracing the outline of the object using a wand. The game began with Morrow telling the contestants what object to look for. He then asked them a true-false question; a countdown clock began at 10 and stopped when a contestant buzzed in. There's a penalty for buzzing in after the clock reach zero for the third time. A correct answer was worth points determined by time left on the clock, and removed a piece of the camouflage; the contestant had ten seconds to find and trace the object. If s/he tried and failed, the opponent got 10 points and a chance to trace it. An incorrect answer also gave the opponent the points and control of the board. (Each contestant had a separate board which his or her opponent could not see.) To help, once a player scored 30 points in the quiz, s/he got to see what the object looked like. The first player to spot and trace the object won the game and a prize. When it was obvious that the contestant had spotted and begun to trace the object, Morrow would say, \\"You say it's there...it is there!\\" Each game had a predetermined point value (up to 200 points), with ten points deducted from the value of the game when a contestant made an incorrect tracing or chose to pass and wait for more of the camouflage to be removed. The winner's prize was determined by that person's score in the quiz added to the points left in the overall value of the game. The day's big winner was given one more object to find in fifteen seconds for a new car. For the bonus round, none of the camouflage was removed. Contestants retired after winning the car or five games, whichever came first. The original version of Camouflage aired from January 9, 1961 to November 16, 1962 on ABC. From January 9, 1961 to June 29, 1962 it aired at 12:00 PM, Eastern; on July 2, 1962 it moved to 12:30 PM and its running time was cut to 25 minutes, with a five-minute newscast airing at 12:55. This continued for the remainder of the original show's run. One of the artists responsible for creating the elaborate drawings for the show, Eric Lieber (then a commercial art student), went on to create the influential relationship show Love Connection in 1983. 1980 On February 4, 1980 Chuck Barris revived this show for syndication with Los Angeles disc jockey Tom Campbell as host. This time around, the contestants answered general-knowledge questions for $50 apiece, and each game had a designated dollar value of $200‚Äì$1,000, with three games played per show. The bonus round was basically the same as on the original version, except there was no time limit. After several weeks, the format was changed slightly: two contestants competed in game 1, followed by two new contestants in game 2, with the potential values of each game reduced to $200‚Äì$500 and the winner of each game playing the bonus round for an additional $1,000. The 3rd game was a playoff between the winners of the first two games, with the champion going on to play the \\"Super Bonus Puzzle\\" for the car. Other program personnel included announcer Johnny Jacobs and musical director Milton DeLugg, who with his \\"Band with a Thug\\" rhythm section provided live music in the studio. =Scheduling and ratings= This was one of the last once-a-week game shows to air in access time (7:00-8:00 PM Eastern, 6:00-7:00 PM Central), as most stations were switching to Monday-through-Friday \\"strip\\" shows. Consequently, Camouflage did not get wide distribution in syndication and was cancelled on May 2. Only thirteen episodes aired. Episode status =ABC= The original series is most likely destroyed, with only two episodes known to exist (both from 1962) - January 8 (the first-anniversary show, with Gilbert guest- hosting) and April 27 (promotes the short-lived game show Window Shopping \\"coming up next\\"). A third episode is held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, along with the latter episode above.Camouflage episodes held by UCLA =1980= The series is likely extant, given that Game Show Network reran several episodes of this version in the 1990s, along with another episode as a Game of the Week in 2000 - although they have not been rerun since.

However, there are the odd few that are grassland or steppe tinamous. There are 21 species of and a total of 67 taxa (species and sub-species). Etymology Crypturellus is formed from the Greek words Œ∫œÅœÖœÄœÑœåœÇ (krupt√≥s), \\"covered\\" or \\"hidden\\", Œø·ΩêœÅŒ¨ (our√°), \\"tail\\", and -ellus, a Latin diminutive suffix. The genus name Crypturellus therefore means \\"small hidden tail\\".Gotch, A. F. (1995) Description Crypturellus members, like other tinamous, have a cryptic color scheme dominated by browns, buffs, yellows, and greys. Unlike the rest of the family, these birds show some sexual dimorphism: the females are more heavily barred than the males and are also a bit brighter and larger. Range The majority of species occupy forests or rain forests, preferring lower elevations. They range from Uruguay to Mexico. However, the earliest known occurrence of the genus is a fossil humerus, described as Crypturellus reai, from the Early Miocene Santa Cruz Formation of Patagonia. Vocalization Crypturellus are a very loud group of birds with melodious calls. They tend to use lower frequency when they call than other members of the Tinamou. Males and females have different calls and each species also has different calls. Normally each sex will have a long and a short phrase call. The genus can be grouped into two partial groups based on the similarity of their calls. * Group 1 ** Undulated tinamou ** Red-legged tinamou ** Yellow- legged tinamou * Group 2 ** Brown tinamou ** Small-billed tinamou ** Tataupa tinamou Some, like the slaty-breasted tinamou are quiet and hide during the middle of the day, choosing this time to take naps and conserve energy. The slaty-breasted tinamous also have a unique call amongst themselves, so much so that individual birds can be recognized by their calls. Most members of the genus have a variation in their calls, within the species, based on their geographical location. They also are known to use regular calling sites. Feeding Similar to other forest tinamou, the members of this genus prefer to eat fleshy fruit; however like tinamous in general they are opportunistic and will eat a variety of foods including insects, which they have been known to leap high to obtain Breeding Courtship technique for the members of Crypturellus consists of the male lowering his breast to the ground, stretching his neck forward and raising his posterior vertically. This will cause the male to appear larger and longer than normal, which not only impresses the female but also benefits the male in that it scares away competitors. Females outnumber the males with some of the species, such as the variegated tinamou, having a 4:1 female-to-male ratio. They also only have a 2-egg clutch, which would explain why they are one of the species that have multiple clutches. Once copulation has taken place, the female will choose a nest site that is typically a depression covered with leaves next to a tree trunk, usually between a couple of buttresses. Members of the genus that are savanna style birds such as the small-billed tinamou will instead lay their eggs in a cavity near a clump of grass. The eggs are oval or elliptical on the smaller birds and near spherical in the larger birds, such as the undulated tinamou and the Brazilian tinamou. The colorings of the eggs are varied, but in general are brightly colored with no splotches or spots; the colors fade over time and usually will change to a less overt color midway through the incubation period. The predominate colors are chocolate or red wine with the eggs of yellow-legged tinamou, undulated tinamou, little tinamou, and red- legged tinamou using different color schemes. Clutch size can be upwards of 9-16 eggs, however these larger clutches are the products of multiple females. The male will incubate and care for the young. Incubation takes about 16 days. If he dies, the female will take over. When the chicks cross cleared areas, they will run like the chicks of rails. Some members of the genus mature rapidly, like the slaty-breasted tinamou which can gain adult size (not weight) by 20 days.

He is the son of noted New Orleans, Louisiana radio personality Bob DelGiorno. DelGiorno is married to Andrea, and father of Anna, Alex, and Nick DelGiorno. DelGiornio is a local talk radio host currently with 99.7 WWTN-FM in Nashville, Tennessee and who was previously on KFAQ-AM in Tulsa, Oklahoma from 2002-2007. In 2002 he helped to establish KFAQ as a talk radio station, switching from its previous format as a country music station known as KVOO. His co-host Gwen Freeman succeeded him after his departure in April, 2007, but shortly afterward (February 2008) also left KFAQ, initially joining him as co-host of his Nashville program. Prior to the launch of KFAQ, DelGiorno was the operations manager of Clear Channel Radio Tulsa and host of the morning show on KTBZ \\"The BUZZ\\" AM 1430. Previous to that DelGiorno was program director and afternoon host on NewsTalk 740 KRMG. In his decade at KRMG, DelGiorno was twice voted \\"Oklahoma Radio Personality of Year\\" by the Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters. DelGiornio's show featured in-depth investigations of local and state politicians, notably Tulsa Mayor Kathy Taylor and Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry. DelGiorno is a born-again Christian and Republican who is also a friend to several prominent Tulsa Democrats. In 2004, DelGiorno published a memoir entitled Standing Up for What's Right () in which he described circumstances involved in his move from KRMG to KFAQ, other moves which he had made earlier in his radio career, his political and religious philosophies and the influences shaping them, and personal details about his life such as his being born with a clubfoot and the career crisis which led him to personal bankruptcy. DelGiorno and co-host Freeman were credited for helping to overturn a Tulsa City Council election for voter irregularities. The loser in that election was Roscoe Turner, a prominent Democrat. After a legal challenge, the election was invalidated and Turner was the winner of the new election. DelGiorno also saw controversy while in Tulsa. An outspoken critic of gambling and Indian casinos, DelGiorno was banned from two separate Indian casinos based upon allegations of inappropriate conduct.Tulsa World: Local radio talk-show host is banished from casinos DelGiorno admitted on the air that he had been gambling, but never admitted to the allegations of misconductTulsa World: Radio show host apologizes DelGiorno was also sued for defamation by Tulsa City Councilor Bill Christiansen over remarks DelGiorno made on the air about Christiansen's business practices. The suit was settled prior to trial. Terms of the settlement were confidential, but DelGiorno's former radio station was required to run a retraction and apologize for DelGiorno's remarks, which the station admitted were not true.http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071220_1_A17_hKFAQ60381 Later, Tulsa City Councilors Chris Medlock and Jim Mautino were the subjects of a recall effort mounted from outside the City of Tulsa. KFAQ took up the challenge, and are credited with helping these City Councilors to survive the recall effort. DelGiorno left KFAQ in Tulsa for WWTN, a higher-rated talk station in the Nashville, Tennessee market, in April 2007.

Fills are an important part of the archaeological record as their formation and composition can throw light on many aspects of archaeological study. Primary fills A primary fill is the context that first appears in the sequence after the context representing the cut it \\"fills\\". In many cases this will be a silt or naturally accumulating material that forms in the base of some hole or trench before its function is realized. For example, a medieval rubbish pit may be open for some time before rubbish is placed in it allowing natural processes to silt up the base, but the interpretation may mark the end of a cut feature's use. Similarly, a ditch that silts up by neglect could represent the start of the end of the features function in the record. Secondary and subsequent fills all form above the primary fill. Primary fills, in the plural sense, are all the fills within a feature that are sealed by layer(s) possibly representing a change in phase or function. Fig 1. Pit fills and slumping layers Slumping Slumping is a process that can occur to any context in the archaeological record and not just fills. Slumping represents how a context's deposition morphology may deform from its original position by natural settling action. This is readily apparent with fills which have a tendency to settle radically over time. This settling is termed slumping and has a bearing on the excavation of cut features. As fills slump the overlying layers which seal the feature will slump in sympathy creating false impressions of fills below the lip of the cut and introduce the possibility of contaminated dating evidence into the features excavation. (See archaeological section in fig 1). also the degree of slumping of the primary fills compared to the slumping of overlying sealing layers is a possible measure of time differences between the formation of the fills the overlying sequence. This is because sealing layers laid down over a slumping feature with the intent of leveling the area for a specific purpose such as construction will either conform to the slumped fills as though the slump has occurred at the time of the sealing layers formation. Or the sealing layers will not take into account the slumping because the slumping is yet to occur. This can lead to sympathetic slumping up the sequence of other features including later structures. Fig 2 Theorized embankment deduced from tip lines Tip lines Tip lines are an intrinsic characteristic of fills, but they can apply to many other types of context such as dumps. Tip lines are the angles which the contexts form as an indicator of action in the past. As fills of a feature form stratigraphically, the direction off the horizontal by which they form may give us information. For example, a ditch that has fills all angled, so one side of each fill is higher on a specific side of the ditch, would suggest that the ditch was backfilled from the side where the fills were highest. (See archaeological section in fig 2). This can be circumstantial evidence for features or detail not preserved in the archaeological record. This reading of a fills deposition morphology is an example of why deposits and contexts are important discoveries in themselves independent of whether they represent structures or contain artifacts.

Truevision, Inc. was a maker of digital video processing add- on boards for PC computers. It was founded by Cathleen Asch, Carl Calabria, Joseph Haaf, Bryan Hunt, Brad Pillow, Joe Shepard and Jeff Walters and others when AT&T; split off their Electronic Photography and Imaging Center (EPICenter) in 1987. EPICenter was founded by Alan Wlasuk, Carl Calabria, Bryan Hunt, Brad Pillow, Joe Shepard and Jeff Walters. Located in Indianapolis, Indiana, Truevision was later acquired by monitor and graphics card maker RasterOps in Santa Clara, California. RasterOps took on the Truevision name and retained the Indianapolis engineering team which continued producing ever more advanced products until 1999 when the company was finally acquired by its biggest competitor, Pinnacle Systems. Pinnacle Systems was later acquired by Avid Technology, who initially used the AT-Vista when they were a two-person startup company. The administrative hierarchy of the company developed into a triumvirate shortly after its inception. Joseph Haaf became VP of Sales and Marketing, Carl Calabria was VP of engineering, Cathleen Asch was VP of Administration and Accounting. Each had equal voting power in corporate decisions-making. The company was privately held by employees until purchased by RasterOps in 1992. Beginning as AT&T; EPICenter with still-image frame grabber cards like the ICB (image capture board), Truevision Inc. went on to pioneer the desktop digital video editing industry with the introduction of the TARGA videographics card in 1987. Its engineers developed brand new ASICs that were eventually powerful enough to perform realtime operations on live video microscopy, which culminated in the TARGA 2000 digital video processing board in 1998. These HUB chips operated with a memory-centric architecture that simplified the task of third-party developers to integrate TARGA boards into their products. Most notable were Japanese companies Sony and Matsushita (Panasonic), who used TARGA in the heart of several of their video editing workstations. Multiple observation methods were supported, and the range of applications has been further increased. Historical Tidbits Still Frame Video Teleconferencing Developed by Bryan Hunt, this was a product using the ICB for still frame video teleconferencing. RA-RAM Row addressable DRAM. The development at AT&T; that allowed the development of the VDA, ICB and Targa cards in the days before DRAM was fast enough for high pixel depth video frame buffer applications. VIDI/O Workbench A card and associated hardware that allowed for complex video waveform and vectorscope analysis and test pattern generation. Fresco One dynamic Truevision development was software, which peaked with the hiring of several software engineers to create programs that would show off the ATVista hardware to its largest advantage. These \\"utilities\\" were often handed to 3rd party software development companies to append or enhance existing applications. However, in 1988, a fully fleshed paint program was developed internally under the working name of Fresco by authors David Cook, Walter Wright, William Romanowski and Shawn Steiner. The complex software had capabilities which far exceeded many of the current paint packages of the day and in some cases had features which are still unrivaled. Fresco was never released.

Bolland Bolland B√ºst of Bolland by Albert Termote (Leiden University) Gerardus Johannes Petrus Josephus Bolland (9 June 1854, Groningen ‚Äì 11 February 1922, Leiden), also known as G.J.P.J. Bolland, was a Dutch autodidact (self-taught man), linguist, philosopher, biblical scholar, and lecturer. An excellent orator, he gave extremely well attended public lectures in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Delft, Groningen, Nijmegen and Belgium. He became an expert in German idealism, being especially interested in the works of Eduard von Hartmann and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. He began researching the formation of Christianity in 1891, and was extremely literate in religious history. He was associated with the Dutch radical school. He effected a revival in Hegelianism in the Netherlands around 1900 by arranging a new edition of Hegel‚Äôs works, and stimulating a renewal of interest in philosophy in the Netherlands. He had a quirky style in his use of the Dutch language causing linguist J.A. D√®r Mouw, among others, to criticise him sharply. Life Bolland was born into a simple Catholic family in Groningen. He reached the position of professor of philosophy at the University of Leiden in 1896 after a career as a teacher in Katwijk aan Zee and as a teacher of English and German in Batavia (Dutch East-Indies). He published \\"Hegel: An Historical Investigation\\" (\\"Hegel. Eene Historische Studie\\") in 1898, and a year later he started publishing Hegel‚Äôs most important works. In 1904 he published \\"Pure Reason. A book for the Friends of Wisdom\\" (\\"Zuivere Rede. Een boek voor vrienden der wijsheid\\"). Bolland had a \\"charismatic and eccentric personality, (was) harshly critical to various social groups and institutions, thus making lots of decided enemies, but also adorers.Klaus Schilling's translation and summary of Hermann Detering's overview of Gerardus Bolland\\". An antidemocratic conservative, he harboured a virulent hatred of Jews, Freemasons and the working class. His statue was removed from the House of Representatives in 2003 because of a complaint by MP Van Raak about Bolland's antisemitism.\\"Wijsgeer Bolland weg\\". Trouw (September 3rd 2003). Bolland described himself as ‚Äúmystic and a ‚Äúdesperate sceptical agnostic‚Äù. Although critical of Christianity and clericalism he was a religious man. After his death, Hegelians of the right formed the Bolland Association (Bolland Genootschap). :\\"The unique position of Bolland in Dutch intellectual history was a paradox in that it was a climax and a fiasco at one and the same time.\\" Harco Rutgers, \\"Dutch Hegelianism: The Cement Of Social Life\\", Section 3: Bolland: the 'self made philosopher', Rotterdam, 1994 Bolland‚Äôs theory of early Christianity Bolland was an advocate of the Christ myth theory.McCown, Chester Charlton.

Scribner. p. 75 He continued Bruno Bauer's \\"concepts about Philo, the Caesars, and their influenceArthur Drews, Dutch Radicalism section of \\"The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present\\", Karlsruhe, 1926\\" on the development of Christianity. He believed that the basis for Christianity developed among strongly syncretised, Hellenized Jews in Alexandria and Judeophile Greeks in the early Common Era. These early beliefs revolved around a mythical Chrestos figure, and were not connected to a nationalistic Messiah figure. Among the influences in these circles were Gnosticism and Hermeticism. Philo‚Äôs writings were also a step in this development, especially the concept of the Logos. He believed the development of Christianity took place during the first century in the decades after the Second Temple‚Äôs fall when the mythic Chrestos figure became transformed into the legendary Jesus. Bolland states that the transformed Chrestos received the name of Moses‚Äô successor, Joshua the son of Nun, who became \\"leader of the people of Israel, as Moses failed to complete the task to guide the people into the promised land\\". According to Bolland, the Gospel of Matthew is the oldest, followed by Luke‚Äôs and then Mark‚Äôs.

Named after Harriet Lane, niece and official hostess of President James Buchanan. Harriet Lane was constructed by Tacoma Boatbuilding, Tacoma, Washington and delivered 20 April 1984. History Harriet Lane was commissioned on 14 June 1984 and has served the Coast Guard and the nation with distinction, for example, by conducting Coast Guard and national defense missions from Maine to South America and even into the Pacific Northwest. In 1994, as the Commander of Operation Able Manner forces, she directed the rescue of thousands of Haitian and Cuban migrants flowing across the Windward Passage and Florida Straits toward U.S. shores. During this mass migration, Harriet Lane's crew saved over 2,400 migrants, directed 15 cutters, an aerostat and multiple aircraft. She has twice been a key U.S. participant in the annual UNITAS multi-national exercise with South American navies in 1994 and 1997. In 1995, Harriet Lane conducted a trial Alaska patrol to determine the feasibility of placing a WMEC in the Seventeenth District. In 1996, Harriet Lane was the on scene commander for much of the initial search and recovery of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island. She escorted an international fleet of tall ships during the OPSAIL 2000 Parade of Sail. Most recently, exhibiting the Coast Guard's multi-mission nature and typical of Harriet Lane's twenty years of service, she stood as a maritime security sentry in Charleston, South Carolina Harbor for the Operation Iraqi Freedom load-out, then moved south to the Caribbean and seized two tons of cocaine headed for the U.S., and finally, rescued several hundred migrants attempting to reach the U.S. in unseaworthy boats. Most recently in May 2010, Harriet Lane was directly involved in response efforts of the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico after the major explosion that sank the rig. This was considered the worst environmental disaster in US history. Notable commanders *Paul F.

Ulta Beauty carries cosmetics and skincare brands, men's and women's fragrances, nail products, bath and body products, beauty tools and haircare products. Each store is also equipped with a salon, Benefit brow bar and Dermalogica skin bar. Ulta Beauty currently has 1,196 stores across all 50 states. History Ulta Salon, Cosmetics and Fragrance was founded by Richard E. George, the former President of Osco Drug, Inc., and Terry Hanson. George left work at Osco in 1989, beginning his attempt to create a business plan for what would later be Ulta. His business plan included a new concept for retail that offers higher-end and lower-end products. Other Osco executives joined George and Hanson in the business, and raised $11.5 million in venture capital, and launched Ulta officially in 1990. In September 1996, Hanson hired Charles \\"Rick\\" Weber, another Osco veteran, as Chief Financial Officer. In the later years, Terry Hanson became president of the company. In December 1999, Lyn Kirby, formerly of Sears Circle of Beauty, became the President and Chief Executive Officer and Weber became Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The two ran the business together until Weber left in September 2006 when he was selected by Tom Stemberg, founder of Staples, to become Chairman and Chief Executive officer of Rec Room Furniture and Games, Inc. On October 25, 2007, the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ. In 2008, the company opened a second distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona. On April 26, 2010, Ulta announced that Carl \\"Chuck\\" Rubin would be appointed as Chief Operating Officer, President, and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective May 10, 2010. According to public filings, Rubin earned over $11.1 million in 2010, making him one of the 20 highest paid CEOs in Chicago. Ulta Beauty, Ann Arbor, Michigan On June 24, 2013, it was announced that Mary Dillon would be appointed as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2013. Dillon was previously the chief of U.S. Cellular and a senior executive at McDonald's and PepsiCo. As of February 2017, the company had a net income of $269 million, and has stock in over 20,000 products including makeup, fragrances, and nail, skin, and hair products. Ulta Beauty offers products from about 500 beauty brands across all categories and price points. Ulta also employs over 35,000 associates, where 88% are female. Ultimately, Ulta Beauty was designed for customers to go into freestanding stores, such as found in strip malls, that allow them to feel comfortable shopping in a makeup store, with no workers handing out samples. In 1994, Ulta had a makeover that eliminated products and items that were typical of drugstores, such as toothbrushes and vitamins. The store moved strictly to beauty products. In 1999, Ulta Beauty changed its name from Ulta3, changing the brand almost entirely. Operations  In 2013, Ulta opened 125 stores in the United States, bringing their total number of locations to 675 stores. They also announced plans to open 100 more locations by the end of 2014. On August 4, 2018, Ulta operated 1,124 stores in 49 states and the District of Columbia. As of February 2, 2019, Ulta operates 1,174 retail stores across 50 states. A majority of Ulta Beauty stores are located in the East Coast region, although California also has a large presence of company- owned stores. Ulta Beauty offers both high-end and drugstore cosmetics, skincare, and fragrances, in addition to its own brand of makeup, bath and body products, skincare, haircare, nail polish, fragrances and some men's products. In May 2017, MAC Cosmetics became available for purchase online, with products scheduled to be in stores beginning in June 2017. Kylie Cosmetics debuted in Ulta stores November 17, 2018. Also, Colourpop Cosmetics launched in Ulta stores on February 25, 2018. Ulta has a salon located in every store nationwide. The store format includes a 950 square feet salon area with eight to ten stations. The salon has a concierge desk, skin treatment room, and semi-private shampoo and hair color processing areas. It offers services including haircuts and coloring from Redken-trained hair stylists, skin treatments and facials from Dermalogica-trained skin therapists, and manicures from OPI-trained professionals. They also provide professional makeup applications. They additionally include the Benefit Brow Bar, which includes services such as brow arching, brow tinting, facial waxing, and eyelash application. Ulta Beauty sales were $713.8 million for the first quarter ending in May 2014. At the end of the second quarter ending in August 2014, Ulta Beauty reported that total sales increased by 22.2 percent and comparable store sales increased 9.6 percent. Wall Street expected the company's total sales to reach $3.19 billion for the fiscal year ending in February 2015, which would be almost three times its 2009 sales levels. As of February 2, 2019 net sales for Ulta Beauty have increased 9.7% to $2,124.7 million. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which started to widely impact the United States retail market in March 2020, Ulta was one of the first retailers to proactively close their retail store locations. This was to protect their employees and guests as well as reduce the spread of the virus. Store closers started on March 19, 2020 and are schedule to reopen on March 30, 2020. Although given the current fluidity of the situation, Ulta is expected to be re-evaluate the opening timeline as information becomes available and more time progresses. Charitable giving The Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation (UBCF), formed in 2016, aims to support the education and well-being of women and their families by partnering with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF), Dress for Success and additional local charities. In 2009, Ulta Beauty partnered with BCRF and in the 10 years since, has raised more than $22 million to support its groundbreaking research. UBCF is among BCRF's top three major donors and is currently helping to fund 16 breast cancer research projects. UBCF partnered with Dress for Success in 2017 to help empower women to achieve economic independence by providing them with professional attire and the resources needed to help them progress their careers. Ulta Beauty provides financial support, products and valuable time to local nonprofit organizations, especially in relation to family and child care, and many leaders serve on the board of various nonprofits organizations. UBCF also has an Associate Relief Program that helps employees at Ulta Beauty affected by a financial hardship.

The company was one of the world's first type foundries to have no history in the production of metal type. It is now a wholly owned brand or subsidiary of Monotype Imaging. History The company was founded to design, license and market typefaces for filmsetting and computer set types internationally. The company issued both new designs and revivals of older or classic faces, invariably re-cut to be suitable for digital typesetting use and produced in families of different weights. Although it is claimed that the designers took care to preserve the style and character of the original typefaces, several ITC revivals, such as ITC Bookman and ITC Garamond in particular, have received criticism that the end result was related in name only to the original faces. Among the company's notable type designers was Ed Benguiat, the creator of Tiffany and Benguiat fonts. ITC's revival designs frequently followed a formulary of increased x-height, multiple weights from light to ultra bold, multiple widths and unusual ligature combinations, sometimes with alternate characters. Critics sometimes complain that, while the dramatically higher x-height increased legibility in smaller point sizes, in normal text sizes the extreme height of the lowercase characters imparted a commercial, subjective voice to texts. In recent years several new revivals have been praised for showing more historical accuracy, and for not increasing the x-height to the dramatic heights of earlier ITC typeface revivals.

Because of its extraordinary blend of typographic design, illustration and cartoons (sometimes by world-renowned artists and cartoonists such as Lou Myers), verse and prose extolling the virtues of well-designed type, as well as contributions by amateur or semi- professional typographers, the magazine was avidly read by type enthusiasts and sought after by collectors the world over. A web version of the magazine started in 1998, along with a brand-new sans-serif logo by Mark van Bronkhorst (replacing the famous swash lettered logo by Herb Lubalin). In an editorial, John D. Berry wrote: \\"There‚Äôll be plenty of overlap between the print magazine and the online magazine, but they won‚Äôt be identical: some things are best done with ink on paper, others are best done on screen.\\" Yet the paper edition, which in 1998 had shrunk in format from tabloid pages to 8.5\\" x 11\\", did not survive for long. The final printed edition was vol. 26 no. 2, dated fall 1999.The Last U&lc; The last numbered U&lc; issue is 42.1.1, issued in 2010. A book celebrating U&lc;, U&lc;: Influencing Design & Typography by John D. Berry (the magazine's final editor) , was published by Mark Batty in 2005. In October 2010 Allan Haley announced on the Fonts.com blog that the complete run of U&lc; had been digitized and would be made available, one year's worth per month, via PDF download from that same blog.U&lc; Back Issues to be Made Available As part of Fonts.com redesign in 2012,Redesigned Fonts.com Premiers with New Look and Features - New site offers a single source for desktop and Web fonts access to U&lc; were moved to fonts.com blog, and Learn About Fonts & Typography for various U&lc; web edition articles. Acquisitions and mergers In 1986 the company was acquired by Esselte Letraset,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/25/business/esselte-letraset.html who had taken over Letraset, originally makers of the first dry transfer lettering, and later to become developers of new typefaces for filmsetting and computer applications. In 2000, Agfa Monotype Corporation announced the acquisition of the capital stock of International Typeface Corporation (ITC) from Esselte. The transaction included ITC‚Äôs complete library of over 1600 typefaces, all typeface subscriber and distributor agreements, the itcfonts.com Web site, and typographic software. At this point ITC ceased to operate as an independent entity.

It opened its first line, between Glasgow and Ayr, in stages from 1839 to 1840. The section between Glasgow and Paisley was made jointly with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway. Later it built a line from Dalry via Kilmarnock to Cumnock, linking there with the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway, and together forming a through route from Glasgow to Carlisle. The two companies merged to form the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The original main line from Glasgow to Ayr, and the line from Kilmarnock to Carlisle, are in use today, although many intermediate stations and branch lines have closed. History =Earliest lines= Coal and other minerals were extracted in the west of Scotland from medieval times; getting the heavy product to market was always a challenge, and this encouraged the development of tracked systems; the earliest platewaysPlateways used L-shaped rails and the wagons had plain wheels; the guidance was achieved through the upstand of the \\"L\\" and the wagons could run conveniently on ordinary ground at the terminals, for example. in the vicinity of Ayr date from‚Äîat the latest‚Äî1775.Harry Broad, Rails to Ayr: 18th and 19th Century Coal Waggonways, Ayr Archaeological and Natural History Society, 1991 In 1812 the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway opened, also a horse-operated plateway, constructed to carry coal from the Kilmarnock area to the harbour at Troon, for onward conveyance by coastal shipping; it was the first railway in Scotland to have an authorising Act of Parliament. In the late 1820s, several further mineral railways were constructed in the west of Scotland: the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway, opened in 1826, proved a remarkable success in carrying coal from the collieries near Airdrie and was quickly followed by the Ballochney Railway. These \\"coal railways\\" used horse traction (mostly) and short cast iron rails on stone block sleepers. The key technical advance was that they used \\"edge rails\\": the guidance was provided by flanges on the wheels of the wagons. These lines showed the way forward.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System: 1722-1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, Don Martin, The Monkland and Kirkintilloch and Associated Railways, Strathkelvin Public Libraries, Kirkintilloch, 1995, In 1831 the Ardrossan Railway opened; it too was a horse-operated line using stone block sleepers, but passenger operation was a major part of its objective. It was conceived as a means of developing Ardrossan Harbour as the sea port for Glasgow. However the promoters were unable to raise sufficient money to build the whole of their line; moreover recent improvements to the navigability of the River Clyde enabled sea-going ships to reach the City. Accordingly, the line was truncated, and only reached a terminal at Kilwinning and collieries east of that town. Nonetheless it was a considerable commercial success, carrying passengers and in enabling coal, particularly from the pits belonging to the Earl of Eglinton to be exported at Ardrossan, and it further emphasised the viability of railways. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway had opened the previous year, and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, and indicated that longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery, could be dealt with, and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next. When the Grand Junction Railway was authorised in 1833, it was possible to consider that railways might one day link central Scotland and the south of England.David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, =Glasgow to Ayr and Kilmarnock= By 1835 the idea of building a railway from Glasgow into Ayrshire gained sufficient support for a survey to be commissioned from John Miller, a partner in the firm of Grainger and Miller, which had been heavily involved in the earlier railways in the west of Scotland. Miller proposed a route from Tradeston, in Glasgow at the south end of Glasgow Bridge, through Paisley and the Garnock Valley to Kilwinning and Ayr, with a branch from Dalry to Kilmarnock. The cost was to be ¬£550,000 and a 10% return could be expected; notwithstanding the south-westerly course of the line, it was foreseen as a first step towards linking with railways in England. Interests in Kilmarnock were dismayed to be consigned to a branch line, and the Burgh Council of Kilmarnock commissioned Scott, Stephen and Gale, an engineering partnership \\"which was not to make a mark on railway engineering\\"Robertson, page 138 to plan a more direct route. Plotting a direct route was easy, but gradients were severe, earthworks would be formidable, and there was much less intermediate business. Gale was a rival canal company's engineer, and was hardly impartial. It was necessary to bring in someone to settle the matter; George Stephenson gave a report supporting Miller's choice of route. Raising capital proved straightforward, and it was possible to present a Bill for the line in the 1837 session of Parliament. There was strenuous opposition from river and canal interests, but this was overcome. At the time the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway (GP&GR;) was also promoting its line, with a similar route from Tradeston to Paisley. It became obvious that Parliament would be hostile to the formation of two adjacent lines, so it was determined to build the line jointly as far as Paisley. Both the GPK&AR; and the GP&GR; received the royal assent on 15 July 1837. The Glasgow, Paisley Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway Act authorised share capital of ¬£625,000, and ¬£208,300 in loans. The line was to be constructed simultaneously from each end, to prevent the experience of the Ardrossan Railway which failed to build the eastern end of its authorised line.Whishaw, p. 114Awdry, page 77 The gauge of the new line was not yet determined, although the estimates had been prepared on the basis that it would not exceed 6 feet. Many of Grainger and Miller's lines had been to a gauge of 4 ft 6in; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway (1831) had been at 4 ft 6¬Ωin (1,384 mm) and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, authorised in 1836, was to be 5 ft 6in (1,676 mm). Connections to local railways were considered important in determining the gauge, but the engineer Joseph Locke urged that conformity to the gauge of the English railways was important, and in the end this was adopted: standard gauge, 4 ft 8¬Ωin (1,435 mm).Locke was advising the Glasgow Paisley and Greenock company, and it was their decision to conform to the gauge of railways in England that obliged the GPK&AR; to follow suit.Campbell Highet, The Glasgow and South Western Railway, Oakwood Press, Lingfield, 1965 =Construction starts= Construction of the line, supervised by Grainger & Miller, proved challenging, as a large-scale contracting industry was not yet in place in Scotland; nor was large-scale financing.SLS, page 2 At the end of 1838 Miller was instructed to build a branch from Barassie to Troon Harbour, earlier thoughts of taking over the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway and converting it‚Äîas it was then still a horse- operated plateway‚Äîhaving been dropped. In 1839 the Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway was engaged in converting its gauge to standard so as to interwork with the GPK&AR; (with which it was to connect at Kilwinning), and the following year it changed its name to the Ardrossan Railway =Opening‚Äîin stages= After a directors' special run between Ayr (north of the river, at Newton-on-Ayr) and Irvine on 19 July 1839, the line opened to the public between those points on 5 August 1839. The Eglinton Tournament, held on Friday 30 August, resulted in huge demand for tickets. For the railway, this was an enormous success and that limited section of the line made a surplus of ¬£500 from opening to the end of that year. The section between Irvine and Kilwinning opened on 23 March 1840. On 13 July 1840 the joint line between Paisley and a temporary terminus in Glasgow at Bridge Street was ready for a demonstration run, opening fully to the public the following day. The remainder of the main line opened in further stages, and the dates for the whole line were: * Glasgow Bridge Street (temporary station) to Paisley (Joint Line): 14 July 1840; * Paisley to a temporary station at Howwood (then spelt Howood): 21 July 1840; * Howood to Beith: 12 August 1840; Howood station then closed; * Beith to Kilwinning: 21 July 1840; * Kilwinning to Irvine: 23 March 1840; * Irvine to Ayr (Newton-on-Ayr): 19 July 1839.SLS The permanent Bridge Street station opened on 6 April 1841. The GPK&AR; moved their head offices to Bridge Street from Gordon Street in March 1841.SLS, page 6 The construction of the main line was stated to have overrun estimated costs considerably, and at a shareholders' meeting in February 1841 it was stated that as a result, the Kilmarnock branch could not be started until authority for additional capital had been obtained, and of course the money actually raised. Kilmarnock had to be content with a coach connection until the line there from Dalry Junction opened on 4 April 1843.Robertson, page 118Wham, p. 54 =By rail and sea to London= The opening of the line and the conversion of the Ardrossan railway to run in connection, enabled a fast service‚Äî26¬Ω hours‚Äîbetween Glasgow and London to be instituted. The fast steamer Fire King plied on alternate days between Ardrossan and Liverpool; from May 1841 the English terminal was transferred to Fleetwood following the opening of the Preston & Wyre Railway and Dock Company. The service only lasted a few days and was not a commercial success; the GPK&AR; sold the vessel to James Burns, who continued the service but \\"soon withdrew it\\", transferring the boat to a route to Ireland. =The railway route to England= Monkton station in 2007 From the time the GPK&AR; was authorised, controversy raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that became known as the Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries‚Äîthe Nithsdale line‚Äîwould have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build. The Government intervened and in 1839 appointed two Royal Commissioners to determine the way forward; at this time there was a presumption that one railway route from Scotland to England would suffice; but which? There was no consensus between expert witnesses, and in 1840 the Commissioners reported that the Annandale route should prevail, but \\"the promoters must prove their bona fide intention to complete the English portion of the line, otherwise preference would be given to the East Coast route\\" (from Edinburgh via Berwick-upon-Tweed and Newcastle upon Tyne). This stalled the whole process: there was no such single group as \\"the promoters\\" of any route via Carlisle, and in fact the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway was not authorised until 1844. The report of the Commissioners was not binding, and the rivalry between supporters of the two routes intensified. An independent Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway was proposed, to build from Carlisle to meet the GPK&AR;, and the GPK&AR; itself proposed several branches, mostly for tactical reasons, to weaken or exclude the Caledonian Railway (CR), as the dominant supporter of the Annandale route. Of these only an extension from Kilmarnock to Horsecleugh, south of the mining town of Old Cumnock was authorised, by Act of 21 July 1845. The CR case was strengthened by its intended branch to Edinburgh;That is, the proposed line from Carlisle would fork and serve both Glasgow and Edinburgh, while a route via Dumfries and Kilmarnock could not reach Edinburgh so directly. moreover locomotive designs were being improved, and the capacity to haul trains over the steep gradients of the Annandale route was diminishing in importance. In Parliamentary hearings in 1845, the Caledonian Railway passed the Commons and despite the GPK&AR; fighting on in the Lords, the Caledonian Railway was authorised, in preference to the Nithsdale route, on 31 July 1845. The Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway felt the setback most keenly, as it had no railway and had just been refused sanction to build one. =A resilient mood; but then collapse= The GPK&AR; was at least able to see a positive future without the line to Carlisle; a 6% dividend was declared in August 1845. The Shareholders approved the lease of the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway (K&TR;); as a horse-operated plateway this would need to be converted and upgraded at a cost of ¬£40,000, but the process would give much improved access to the harbour for collieries in the area. In addition a mineral line was to be built from Auchinleck, on the Cumnock extension, to Muirkirk. There had long been an ironworks at Muirkirk which suffered from the disadvantage of poor transport links to market;Thomas Martin Devine, Gordon Jackson (editors), Glasgow: Beginnings to 1830, Manchester University Press, Manchester, 1995, in addition a new ironworks at Lugar would also be accessed by the line.Alan Birch, The Economic History of the British Iron and Steel Industry, 1788 - 1880, Routledge, Abingdon, reprint 2006, The 1846 session of Parliament experienced a snowstorm of bills for new railways; many of these threatened to encroach on the GPK&AR; area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in self-defence the GPK&AR; itself promoted numerous schemes‚Äîin fact 25 branches as well as a bill nominally by the K&TR; to authorise the modernisation works‚Äîto head off some of the encroachment. In this session, the remodelled Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway got its authorising Act of Parliament (on 13 August or 16 July), to build from Horsecleugh (near Cumnock, the southern limit of the GPK&AR; authorisation) to Gretna Junction, reaching Carlisle from Gretna over the Caledonian Railway line. The Act stipulated that on actual completion of the construction, the GD&CR; should merge with the GPK&AR; to form a new company, the Glasgow and South Western Railway. This huge volume of intended activity was fuelled by financial speculation‚Äîthe \\"railway mania\\". It appeared that fortunes could be made by subscribing to shares in new lines, and the subscriber only had to put a small deposit down until construction got under way. Over-optimism led to stark inability to pay up when the calls (for cash on subscribed shares) came in, and suddenly money was impossible to come by. Most of the speculative schemes collapsed at once. =Regaining momentum= Ballochmyle ViaductAlthough in difficulties for cash, the GD&CR; started construction; obstructions by the Caledonian Railway at the Gretna end were eventually resolved, and a fresh Act structuring the merger with the GPK&AR; was passed (on 9 July 1847), but \\"so heavily amended ... as to be useless to the Companies\\".Ross, G&SWR;, page 31 On 1 March 1847 the Kilmarnock and Troon line reopened, as a standard gauge locomotive operated railway. It had been closed for the modernisation work, and it now provided a proper link from Kilmarnock to the coast. The GPK&AR; opened a short connecting spur between its own line and the K&TR; in Kilmarnock. On the same day a branch at Dalry to Swinlees was opened; there was a copper mine there.Swinlees Copper Mine at Aditnow Website, [www.aditnow.co.uk]; free registration required On 22 July 1847 the company acquired control of the Paisley and Renfrew Railway under the Paisley & Renfrew Railway Sale and Improvement Act. ,.RobertsonLewin, p. 36 The purchase had earlier been agreed by the proposed Paisley, Barrhead and Hurlet Railway, supported by the GPK&AR;, for ¬£34,000. It was horse-operated and had a track gauge of 4 ft 4in (1,321 mm). The line was loss-making and had no practical value other than the tactical one of securing territory against competing companies.Awdry states on page 98 that the sale was completed on 31 July 1852. The Paisley Barrhead and Hurlet Bill failed in the 1847 session of Parliament and was re-presented in 1848; the share capital proposed had risen to ¬£230,000; during the Lords' hearings it became plain that running powers were likely to be granted to the Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, an offshoot of the Caledonian Railway. The GPK&AR; had subscribed to ¬£150,000 in face value of the shares of this proposed line, with the sole intention of excluding the Caledonian Railway from the area. The GPK&AR; now petitioned against the Bill, but this was unsuccessful, and it received the Royal Assent, with the running powers clause, on 31 August 1848. Having a majority shareholding, the GPK&AR; was able to stall any plans to proceed with construction of the Hurlet line, but on 9 October a special GPK&AR; Shareholders' Meeting reviewed the financial commitments made by their Board in the frenzied days of 1845 and 1846, when support to numerous new lines had been committed; the meeting left the directors in no doubt as to their disapproval. On 28 May 1848 a line opened between Irvine and Busbie, about 2 miles (3 km) north-west of Kilmarnock; a short branch to Irvine Harbour opened on the same day.Wham, p. 57SLS says 22 May 1848 The Cumnock line as far as Auchinleck and the Muirkirk branch from that point, opened on 9 August. This included the Ballochmyle Viaduct, located near Catrine; it was built with a central span of 181 feet (55.2 m) and 175 feet (53.3 m) high above the River Ayr. It was the largest masonry arch span in the world at the time of its completion, and is the highest railway bridge in Britain.Gordon Biddle and O S Nock, The Railway Heritage of Britain : 150 Years of Railway Architecture and Engineering, Studio Editions, 1990, Also on 9 August 1848 the Newmilns branch opened from Hurlford to Galston. A branch to Perceton Colliery (a short northward spur from the Irvine - Busbie line) opened on 26 June 1848. On 1 July 1848, a Perceton branch from the Doura line of the Ardrossan Railway opened. It was actually the only part of the Glasgow Kilmarnock and Ardrossan Railway to be built; it became part of the Ardrossan Railway. On 26 February 1849 the Fairlie branch of the former Kilmarnock and Troon Railway was opened. =Completing the line to Carlisle= Gailes station in 2007 The Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway had been proceeding with construction as fast as funds would allow, and on 23 August 1848 it opened its line between Gretna and Dumfries. At Gretna passengers could change to Caledonian Railway trains; the Dumfries station was a temporary structure south of Annan Road. The GPK&AR; provided the rolling stock to its junior partner. The GD&CR; was insolvent, owing ¬£230,000 and needing ¬£602,000 to complete the line; these facts emerged after another bruising session at which shareholders criticised the liabilities and futile Parliamentary expenses incurred by the directors of both companies. (In fact there was considerable overlap on the two boards.) By March 1849 these negative feelings led to the GPK&AR; Chairman, James McCall being removed along with several directors; Andrew Orr took over as chairman, but for a period the remaining directors from the earlier years formed an obstructive group; their motivation seemed to be the personal liabilities they had taken on on behalf of the company, and their wish to be indemnified against personal loss. Orr eventually resolved these issues and on 24 August, Orr held shareholders' meetings of each company (separately) and announced that all the \\"old\\" directors had resigned, and that a new board would shortly be formed, with an identical composition for the two companies. The engineer John Miller also resigned at this time in the interest of economy. All the remaining GD&CR; construction contracts had been let and were proceeding, and the two companies would operate as a single unit using GPK&AR; rolling stock. On 20 May 1850 the line was opened between Auchinleck and New Cumnock, completing the GPK&AR; southward extension and including the northern extremity of the GD&CR; line. By 28 October 1850 the final section of the main line to Carlisle was completed by the GD&CR;, and trains began to run through to Carlisle; evidently the difficulty with the Caledonian Railway from Gretna southwards had been resolved. =The Glasgow and South Western Railway is formed= The GPK&AR; and the GD&CR; had already been authorised by the Acts of 1846 and 1847 to amalgamate at this stage. In fact the GD&CR; was absorbed by the GPK&AR; which then changed its name to the G&SWR; the 1847 Act provided for the vesting of the GD&CR; in the GPK&AR; on the date of the opening throughout of the GD&CR;, when that company would be dissolved. From the date of the amalgamation the company would be called the Glasgow and South Western Railway.Glasgow and South Western Railway Incorporation Act, 1847, paraphrased in SLS On 28 October 1850 the Glasgow and South Western railway started its existence. Train services The first services on the line in 1839, between Irvine and Ayr, travelled at an average of with stoppages averaging 1 min 6 secs per station,Whishaw, p. 118 meaning a trip along the entire line at that point would have taken around 35¬Ω minutes. The maximum fare for passengers at the time was 2d, 1¬Ωd and 1d for first, second and third class respectively. 137,117 passengers travelled on the line during the first year of services. In conjunction with the Ardrossan Railway, which was regauged in 1840, on alternate days a fast steamboat service ran between Ardrossan Pier and Liverpool, and vice versa.Hamilton Ellis, Vol 1, (1954), P113. This connected with the Grand Junction Railway and London and Birmingham Railway's expresses to London. In 1841 the steamboat service was transferred from Liverpool to the new Port at Fleetwood, Lancashire. In March 1850 the passenger train service consisted of five trains southbound and four northbound on the Ayr line; these called at all stations except that Cochrane Mill was served only by the first southbound and last northbound trains; the journey time to Ayr was two to two and a half hours. The service between Glasgow and Muirkirk had four trains each way, but only two went throughout; one trip was to and from Auchinleck only, and one was to and from Kilmarnock; there were connecting trains from Ayr to Irvine. The journey time Glasgow to Muirkirk was three hours. Three of the four Kilmarnock line trains were combined with Ayr trains between Glasgow and Irvine, and between Dalry and Kilmarnock trains travelled via Irvine and Dreghorn. In addition a \\"Glasgow to Troon direct\\" train was advertised, running on Wednesdays and Fridays in connection with the steamers to Liverpool, leaving Glasgow at 4.30 pm. This is the departure time of an ordinary parliamentary train to Troon and Ayr, so it does not appear to be a separate boat train.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 3rd mo, (March) 1850, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2012, Rolling stock Phoenix - an Edington and Son 2-2-2 locomotive built 1840-1841 The original locomotives used on the line in 1839 were similar to those used on the London and Birmingham Railway, having cylinders, stroke and four wheels. Designed by Bury,SLS, page 24 the 2-2-0 locomotives cost around ¬£1,200 per engine were given the names Mazeppa, Mercury, Marmion and Cutty-sark. Two more of the same design were obtained in 1841 named Stuart and Bute. The six original locomotives were withdrawn between 1858 and 1860. In 1840-1841 twelve 2-2-2 locomotives (designed by company engineer J. Miller) were built and given names such as Bruce, Eglinton, Phoenix, Prince Albert and Loudoun. Bruce and Cutty-sark hauled the first special train from Glasgow to Ayr on 11 August 1840. Early passenger carriages were of similar design to those used on railways in England at the time, holding eighteen passengers on first class carriages, and thirty on second class. Third class carriages originally had seats, but on 15 April 1840 a board decision declared that all future third class carriages were to be made without seats.SLS, page 5 All existing third class carriages also had their seats removed. A later board decision on 3 July 1840 ordered that third class carriages would be situated closest to the engine, followed by second class, with first class at the rear. Development under the Glasgow and South Western Railway The Glasgow and South Western Railway emblem, originally used by the GPK&AR.; On taking over the GPK&AR; and GD&CR; networks, the Glasgow and South Western Railway had a main line from Glasgow to Ayr, and from Glasgow to Carlisle, and some branches. It already served areas rich in minerals, especially coal and ironstone, and had useful access to west coast ports. It had two main limitations. The first was that the Carlisle line was very circuitous compared with the competing Caledonian Railway (CR) route via Beattock, which also served Edinburgh; the route also depended on running over the CR from Gretna Junction to Carlisle, and needed accommodation at Carlisle station. The CR was to prove a formidable competitor for Anglo-Scottish traffic, both passenger and goods, and much energy and money were expended in securing exclusive territory for the G&SWR;, and in keeping the CR out. The second issue was that both the Glasgow and Ayr stations were awkward. The Glasgow station, at Bridge Street, was on the south of the Clyde (and Glasgow Bridge carried a toll at the time). The Ayr station was north of the River Ayr, and although not inconvenient for passenger access to the town, the location prevented southward railway extension. The means adopted to overcome these challenges are described more fully in the Glasgow and South Western Railway and other articles. In overview: * The company encouraged local promoters to build railways that extended or fed the G&SWR; often this was with substantial financial support from the company; * a number of branches were constructed directly; this was especially the case to serve districts where mining was dominant; * in later years a number of agreements were finalised with the Caledonian Railway over primacy of territory and limitation on the formation of encroaching routes; * the Ayr and Dalmellington Railway, encouraged by the G&SWR;, built its line southwards from Falkland Junction, immediately north of Ayr station; the new line passed round the east side of the burgh, and a new through station for Ayr was provided on it in 1857; after initial reluctance, this became the main passenger station for Ayr; * with the North British Railway, the G&SWR; sponsored the City of Glasgow Union Railway, which opened a line crossing the Clyde in Glasgow and making a south to north link line; as part of that scheme a new passenger terminal at St Enoch was opened, and (no less important) a central goods terminal at College, on land vacated by the University of Glasgow; the river crossing and a temporary central station were in use in 1870 and the St Enoch station was opened in 1876; after a short time the Bridge Street station was vacated by the G&SWR; * the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway was made, jointly with the Caledonian Railway, forming a direct route between Glasgow and Kilmarnock, and shortening the route from Glasgow to Carlisle; this opened in 1873; the Dalry to Kilmarnock line was reduced in importance for express passenger trains, but continued as an important link from Carlisle to the West Coast ports, and for mineral and goods traffic. Twentieth century closures In the first half of the twentieth century, the extractive industries of the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process took place in the iron and steel production industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, and could not be sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities. The heavy rationalisation process in British Railways in the 1960s, often referred to as the Beeching Axe, resulted in a re-assessment of those lines, at a time when efficient bus services were abstracting passengers from often infrequent and inconvenient train services. The effect of this process on the original GPK&AR; network can be summarised thus: * Glasgow to Ayr: still operating; electrified 19 January 1987; a diversion to serve Troon more conveniently replaced a short section of the original main line there in 1892; * Dalry to Kilmarnock: closed to local passenger trains on 18 April 1966.;Stansfield, page 18 a night sleeper train continued running over the line, giving a direct Paisley to London service, but the line closed completely on 23 October 1973; * Kilmarnock to Horsecleugh: still operating as part of the Glasgow - Kilmarnock - Dumfries - Carlisle route; * Irvine to Busbie Junction: closed to local passenger traffic on 6 April 1964,Stansfield, page 25 and closed completely 11 October 1965;Hurst, page 40 * Irvine Harbour branch; closed; * Perceton branch; closed; * Barassie to Kilmarnock (former Kilmarnock and Troon Railway): still operating; * Auchinleck to Newmilns: the section between Auchinleck and Cronberry closed to passenger traffic on 3 July 1950. The line between Cronberry and Newmilns was part of a route between Ayr and Muirkirk, but this too closed to passenger trains on 1 October 1950. In 1951 services were reinstated for two weeks to accommodate diverted trains from Edinburgh to Ayr. The entire line from Auchinleck to Muirkirk then closed to regular passenger traffic on 1 October 1950; the line was used until 1976.Stansfield, pages 12 and 29 Topography A viaduct on the closed Dalry to Kilmarnock line in 2007 The line near the site of the closed Beith station in 2007 Note: station and route details are confined to those opened during GPK&AR; days, and the subsequent history of those stations and routes; details of stations opened on the route later than 1850, and of contiguous routes opened later, can be found in the Glasgow and South Western Railway article.

Life Leon Roger Payne was born in Alba, Texas, on June 15, 1917. He was blind in one eye at birth, and lost the sight in the other eye in early childhood. He attended the Texas School for the Blind from 1924 to 1935, where he met his future wife, Myrtie Velma Courmier. They had two children together, as well as two children from Myrtie's previous marriage. Leon Payne died at age 52 from cancer in 1969 in San Antonio, Texas. His wife Myrtie died in San Antonio in 2008, and Leon's composition \\"I Love You Because\\" was played at her funeral service by pedal steel guitarist Emmett Roch, accompanied by musicians who were members of her church. Career Leon wrote hundreds of country songs in a prolific career that lasted from 1941 until his death in 1969. He is perhaps best known for his hits \\"I Love You Because\\", \\"You've Still Got a Place in My Heart\\" and the 1948 song \\"Lost Highway\\", a song made famous by Hank Williams in 1949 (in appreciation, Hank gave his 1938 Martin D-18 guitar to Leon). Leon Payne also wrote under the pen-name of \\"Pat Patterson\\" on tracks such as \\"It's Nothing to Me\\" performed by Sanford Clark. He began his music career in the mid-1930s, playing a variety of musical instruments in public, and later performing on KWET radio in Palestine, Texas, starting in 1935. He also had a stint playing with Bob Wills' Texas Playboys in 1938. Payne was a regular working musician at Jerry Irby‚Äôs nightclub in Houston, Texas.Colin Escott, Hank Williams - The Biography, Boston, 1995, p. 98. He joined his stepbrother, famed songwriter Jack Rhodes, and formed Jack Rhodes and The Lone Star Buddies in 1949. They performed regularly on the Louisiana Hayride show in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was later on the Grand Ole Opry. Much of his musical legacy is in the form of recordings of his songs by other artists, perhaps most famous of which are two of his songs recorded by Hank Williams: \\"Lost Highway\\" and \\"They'll Never Take Her Love From Me\\", which were both minor hits.

He was born in the Georgian capital city of Tbilisi, where he studied at the Tbilisi State Conservatoire and graduated in 1952 with a diploma in composition, conducting and piano. Biography In 1953 he went to Moscow to study at the faculty of mathematics, but in two years he quit and entered the State Film Institute (VGIK) where his teachers were Alexander Dovzhenko and Mikhail Chiaureli. While still a student, he began working at the Gruziafilm studios in Tbilisi, first as an assistant director and then as an editor of documentaries. In 1958 he directed his first short film Akvarel. In 1961 he graduated from VGIK with a diploma in film direction. When his medium-length film Aprili (1961) was denied theatrical distribution, Iosseliani abandoned filmmaking and in 1963‚Äì1965 worked first as a sailor on a fishing boat and then at the Rustavi metallurgical factory. Aprili was finally released only in 1972. In 1966 he directed his first feature film Giorgobistve that was presented at the Critics' Week at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival and won a FIPRESCI award there. When his 1976 film Pastorali was shelved for a few years and then granted only a limited distribution, Iosseliani grew sceptical about getting any artistic freedom in his homeland. Following Pastorali's success at the 1982 Berlin Film Festival, the director moved to France where in 1984 he made Les Favoris de la Lune. The film was distinguished with a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. Since then Venice became a showcase for all his subsequent films. In 1986 he was a member of the jury at the 36th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1989 he again received a Special Jury Prize for Et la Lumiere Fut and in 1992 the Pasinetti Award for Best Direction for La Chasse aux Papillons. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union he continued to work in France where he made the documentary Seule Georgie (1994) which was followed by the sardonic and allegorical Brigands - Chapitre VII (1996). In 1995 he was a member of the jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival. In 2011 his film Chantrapas was selected as the Georgian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, Also verified with Georgian National Film Centre but it did not make the final shortlist. In 2011 Otar Iosseliani received a lifetime achievement honor ‚Äì the CineMerit Award at the Munich International Film Festival. It was given by his former pupil, a Georgian filmmaker Dito Tsintsadze.  Political views  Iosseliani holds political views that are considered Russophobia by some observers.\\"200 Years of Contempt and Hatred\\" by Argumenty i Fakty, 29 June 2009.

Music career Fiorentino was born in Naples and studied at the Conservatorio San Pietro a Majella in Naples under Luigi Finizio and Paolo Denza, earned his diploma in 1946 and attended a master class of Carlo Zecchi in Salzburg in 1948. He debuted at New York's Carnegie Recital Hall in 1953. The next year, however, while on tour in Argentina and Uruguay, he suffered a near-fatal plane accident, forcing him to cut back on concert performances. This led to him becoming a teacher at the Naples Conservatory of Music, where he had once been a student. In the late 1950s he made a new start in concert performances, both in his native country and in England. Many of his recordings were made during those years (1958‚Äì1965). But again, he withdrew from the concert stage, limiting his rare public appearances to his native country, and again started to regularly teach master classes. After leaving the Naples Conservatory in 1993, he again began to play more in public outside his native Italy and performed in Germany, France, Taiwan, and the United States. He also made a series of acclaimed recordings for Appian Publications & Recordings (APR) in Berlin during four sessions between 1994 and 1997. An augmented 10-CD set of these recordings was issued by Piano Classics in 2012. Negotiated and contracted engagements in Russia and Canada as well as a scheduled fifth recording session for APR could not be fulfilled due to his sudden death in his home in Naples on August 22, 1998. Fraud with Concert Artists label Beginning in 1994 through after his death in 1998, a large number of recordings by Fiorentino were released. Recordings made in Berlin from 1994 to 1997 were released on APR whereas earlier unissued material was put out by the Concert Artists label. In February 2007, Concert Artists admitted to falsely attributing music recorded by others to the late Joyce Hatto. Subsequently, a CD of mazurkas by Fiorentino produced by Concert Artists (CACD9002-2) has been found to contain plagiarised tracks from three other performers. Some of Fiorentino's recordings made during the late fifties and early sixties were issued after the original label's (Saga) failure under pseudonyms by the new owner (Marcel Rodd).

Its scientific name is derived from Venetian terms for small rails. The spotted crake (P. porzana) is the type species. Taxonomy The genus Porzana was erected by the French ornithologist Louis-Pierre Vieillot in 1816 with the spotted crake (Porzana porzana) as the type species. The genus unites the typical \\"crakes\\" found essentially anywhere in the world except desert and polar regions. It contains 3 living species. In addition, a large number of prehistorically extinct species known only from fossil or subfossil remains have been discovered. The genera Coturnicops, Crex (including Crecopsis) and Laterallus have been suggested to be closely related. However, molecular phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the suspicion, raised in the late 20th century in the first cladistic studies of morphology, that the \\"genus\\" Porzana is rather an evolutionary grade, consisting of an assemblage of unrelated plesiomorphic rails. Micropygia is maintained as monotypic genus for the ocellated crake until its relationships are fully resolved. The ash-throated crake, which was only tentatively placed in Porzana, has been united with the two former species of Neocrex in Mustelirallus; they are almost certainly closely related to Pardirallus.Slikas, B.; Olson, Storrs L. & Fleischer, R.C. (2002): Rapid, independent evolution of flightlessness in four species of Pacific Island rails (Rallidae): an analysis based on mitochondrial sequence data. J. Avian Biol. 33(1): 5-14. (HTML fulltext) The molecular data find Crex part of a more ancient lineage including Gallirallus and Rallus however; this clade (without Crex) is also well supported by the morphological data, so the similarities between Crex and the crakes seem to be due to a convergent anatomy. Coturnicops and Laterallus, meanwhile, seem closely related to each other and at least the dot-winged crake and yellow-breasted crake as well as Anurolimnas, but not to the core group of Porzana. Part of Amaurornis seems to form a complex with the remaining small species of \\"Porzana\\"; the old name Zapornia is now re-established for these. Finally, there is Porzana proper, a group of a few fairly large species which seems close to the last common ancestor of coots and moorhens; the spot-flanked gallinule, presently placed in Gallinula or separated in a monotypic Porphyriops, may be a particularly close relative. Description and ecology These birds are among the smaller members of their family, none being larger than a chicken and some really tiny, smaller than a starling or thrush. Their upperparts are a cryptic lighter or darker brownish hue. The underside is also brown in some, but more often buff or grey. Several species have patterns like whitish dots or black- and-white barred flanks, conspicuous close up, but at a distance providing additional camouflage in these birds' habitat. Some others are rather uniformly blackish-brown all over. The bill and feet are often brightly colored in red to yellow hues; the eyes' iris has some reddish-brownish hue, sometimes being bright red and also very conspicuous at close quarters. Porzana males and females generally differ barely if at all; in the little crake (P. parva), however, they differ so much they might be mistaken for separate species.Taylor & van Perlo (1998) Australian crake (P. fluminea) Most species of Porzana crakes inhabit wetlands. Some, however, are (or were) found on rocky islands with little water; even these, though, prefer places where abundant vegetation provides a dense ground-cover to hide in. They are usually reclusive and shy, but unlike the larger rails are active and inquisitive birds. When foraging, they will investigate anything that catches their attention and is not considered a predator; in some places, this even includes any humans and their food or equipment that visit these birds' habitat. Their food is mostly small invertebrates ‚Äì typically arthropods and mollusks ‚Äì as well as selected plants, seeds and fruit. This is complemented by any small vertebrate they can catch, such as a fish or frog. They can swim if they need to and even dive a bit, but not for extended distances; rather, they prefer to clamber through dense reeds to escape threats, or walk on floating vegetation or just passively drift around a spot when foraging. As usual for Rallidae, their flight is rather clumsy and their navigation skills and ability to maintain course against the wind are poor; on the other hand, their stamina in the air is exception for their small size; several species migrate thousands of kilometers every spring and autumn, while others originated from wind-blown individuals swept to oceanic islands just as far away from any continent. In this regard, Porzana presently in fact stands supreme among the Rallidae, and even among birds in general it is quite remarkable for its radiation of oceanic island lineages. Gallirallus rivals it in extent, but unlike the cosmopolitan Porzana crakes these rails simply originate in the region next to Oceania and have otherwise not much spread beyond. Porzana species, by contrast, are attested from islands in almost every ocean. As usual for oceanic-island Rallidae, a number of them eventually became flightless due to the rarity of predators on their ocean homes; most of them went extinct from hunting and predation after humans and their accompanying animals reached these islands. The social and sexual habits of this genus do not markedly differ from the usual standards of their family. They possess the typical complex repertoire of calls, usually quite high-pitched due to the small size (the namesake \\"crake\\" calls), but in some situations communicate with a surprisingly deep booming calls. Porzana crakes are monogamous and defend a territory during the breeding season. For the rest of the year, the pairs split and territories are abandoned; pairmates often choose a different partner for the next breeding season. The nest sites are typically in hidden spots at the water's edge, but can be in any dense clump of vegetation between shallow water and dry land as the situation requires. Not much effort is put into building the nest; usually the parents do little more than press down the plants with their bodies. However, the nest cup is carefully lined with soft dry plant material, feathers or hair, which the parents collect specifically for this purpose. The clutch is around 5‚Äì10 eggs (a few species have less) whose buffish color is more or less obscured by a rather even and dense cover of brown to purplish dots. The hatchlings are remarkably long-legged and covered blackish down feathers as is typical for rails and crakes. They are precocial and able to leave the nest immediately after recovering from hatching. After a few days they can accompany their parents on long walks, and the nest is soon deserted. After two months or so, the young learn to fly and are able to fend for their own, and have parted ways with their parents. If the pair nests early and/or the clutch fails, they will usually try to raise a second clutch in the same season.

A few older fossils of extant rail lineages are known, suggesting that older Porzana (or at least Zapornia) fossils may also eventually be found. More importantly, the comparatively abundant remains from around 4 million years ago may indicate that even Porzana proper had its near-cosmopolitan distribution at that time already.

Generally it is found on lower hills and inland valley floors where soil is fertile and well drained. In New Zealand the species is called Fuscospora fusca. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 35 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, broad ovoid, 2 to 4 cm long and 1.5 to 3 cm broad, the margin distinctively double-toothed with each lobe bearing two teeth. The fruit is a small cupule containing three seeds. Pollen from the tree was found near the Antarctic Peninsula showing that it formerly grew in Antarctica since the Eocene period. Red beech is not currently considered threatened. Uses Red beech is the only known plant source, apart from rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), of the C-linked dihydrochalcone glycoside nothofagin. It is also grown as an ornamental tree in regions with a mild oceanic climate due to its attractive leaf shape. It has been planted in Scotland and the North Coast of the Pacific of the United States. The red beech's wood is the most durable of all the New Zealand beeches. It was often used in flooring in many parts of New Zealand. The timber is exceptionally stable when dried to appropriate moisture values. The average density of red beech at 12 percent moisture content is 630 kilograms per cubic metre.

Life Nicolas Bonet was born in the Touraine region of France, where he entered the Franciscan convent at Tours. Nothing is known about his early life. He was incepted as Master of Theology at Paris in the year 1333-4W.O. Duba, \\"Three Franciscan Metaphysicians after Scotus,\\" in: F. Amerini & G. Galluzzo (eds.), The Latin Medieval Commentaries on Aristotle's Metaphysics, Leiden, Brill 2014, 413-493., where he received the title of \\"Doctor Pacificus\\" (The Peaceful Doctor) on account of his suave and tranquil mode of lecturing. Bonet took part in the heated dispute concerning John XXII's view on the beatific vision which was finally settled by the decree of his successor, Benedict XII, \\"Benedictus Deus\\". He was a member of the papal embassy tasked by Benedict XII to prepare a diplomatic mission to Kublai Khan, in response to the khan's petition to Benedict XII for new labourers in the Franciscan missions of Asia. The pope tasked four Franciscans: John of Florence, afterwards Bishop of Bisignano in Calabria, Nicholas Bonet, Nicholas of Molano, and Gregory of Hungary. The delegates, bearing letters from the pope to the khan, left Avignon towards the end of the year 1338 and returned to Avignon in 1354.Arnald of Sarrant, Muscat, Noel (2010). Chronicle of the Twenty-Four Generals of the Order of Friars Minor, p. 80. Ordo Fratrum Minorum, Malta. Bonet did not join the mission himself, because he was consecrated Bishop of Malta by Pope Clement VI on November 27, 1342. It is assumed that Nicolas died in 1343, since the bull appointing his successor mentions his death.\\"Nicolaus Bonetus\\", 29 January 2015. Retrieved on 04 February 2015. Works All four of Nicolas's surviving works have been printed in the sixteenth century. They are his Metaphysica, Philosophia Naturalis, Praedicamenta andTheologia naturalis. Older histories mention some other works, including a treatise on the immaculate conception, a treatise on the formal distinction and his commentary on Peter Lombard's Sentences. Since none of these works survive, their attribution is uncertain. Philosophy Metaphysics Most of Nicolas's metaphysics is contained in his Metaphysica. Unlike many of his predecessors and contemporaries, Nicolas did not simply write a commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics. Instead, he opted to provide a systematic order to his Metaphysica, departing from the most general principles and working towards specifics. His main sources of inspiration for doing so were Aristotle himself and Avicenna. It has therefore been argued that Nicolas's Metaphysica was the first systematic treatise on metaphysics, preceding Francisco Su√°rez by multiple centuries. Many of the topics discussed belong to the core of Scotist metaphysics and medieval metaphysics in general: the formal distinction, the subject of metaphysics, the object of the intellect and the different properties of being. Recent scholarship has drawn attention to whether or not his metaphysics can be seen as a supertranscendental science and Nicolas's conception of unity. Natural philosophy Both Nicolas's Praedicamenta and Philosophia Naturalis contain an atomistic account of nature, a view Nicolas shared with Gerardus Odonis.

It is part of Alpine Shire local government area and on the banks of the Ovens River, near the Buckland River junction. At the , Porepunkah had a population of 941. The town is named for the Hindi word for \\"gentle breeze\\". History Mount Buffalo sedan car, 1925 European settlement began in the 1830s, but it wasn't until the discovery of gold in the 1850s that development of the town took place. Porepunkah is the nearest modern township to the site of the Buckland Riot, an anti-Chinese race riot that occurred on 4 July 1857. The notorious bushranger Harry Power defied police in the Ovens district for a decade. Power held up the mail coach at Porepunkah on 7 May 1869 after escaping from Pentridge Prison. Porepunkah Post Office opened on 22 February 1870. Although the Post Office doesn't exist exclusively today, the Porepunkah Roadhouse provides Australia Post services to the community as there is no mail service to homes. Porepunkah Primary School (No. 1144) was officially opened on 23 January 1873, with Henry Jeffreys as the headmaster and an enrolment of 43 children. The school remains open today. The Porepunkah Recreation Reserve was gazetted on 11 April 1895. Porepunkah was proclaimed a township on 22 June 1910 by Lord Carmichael, the Governor of Victoria. Porepunkah railway station was the stopping point for passengers to disembark for Mount Buffalo. In June 1925 a \\"sedan passenger car\\" was introduced to transport up to 27 people from the station to the Mount Buffalo Chalet. Industry Tobacco used to be grown near Porepunkah, but the industry was shut down in 2006. There are hop gardens near Porepunkah towards Eurobin. There are several vineyards and wineries in the Porepunkah district, which is part of the cool-climate Alpine Valleys wine region. There is one dairy farm in the Buckland Valley operated by the Lumsden family. Bruce Lumsden is an international ploughing competitor.The Border Mail, A sport to plough into, 19 April 2010 Nearby softwood plantations provide seasonal employment for thinning, pruning, planting and harvesting. In the 2016 Census, the most common industries of employment for persons aged 15 years and over usually resident in Porepunkah were accommodation (13.3%); hospitals (7.0%); supermarket and grocery stores (4.8%); cafes and restaurants (4.6%); and local government administration (4.1%). As there are no health services or local government offices located in Porepunkah; the statistics reflect that Porepunkah is partly a dormitory town for Bright and Myrtleford. Sport Football, cricket and cycling were popular sports at Porepunkah in the early 20th century. Porepunkah teams competed against rivals from Bright and district. Porepunkah competed in the Myrtleford Bright Football League as late as 1951. On 10 April 1913, The Argus newspaper in Melbourne reported a \\"country record\\" of six wickets for one run by Porepunkah bowler John Graham in a match against Wandiligong. Porepunkah won the 1915 Bright District Football League premiership when the competition was cancelled to aid recruiting for the war as Porepunkah \\"had a substantial lead from the other clubs\\". Today, the Porepunkah Panthers baseball team plays at the Porepunkah Oval in the North Eastern Baseball Association. There are tennis courts at the Porepunkah Hall.

Stability in flight was important because it allowed the javelin to land on its point, which was the only way the throw could be accurately recorded in competition or be useful against a live target. An amentum also increased the effective length of the throwing arm, as does a spear-thrower, and so enhanced speed. Throwing technique The javelin was held at ear level and released after a short run. The amentum was looped over the first two fingers of the throwing hand so as to slip off when the throw was made. In competition throwing for distance, including the Ancient Olympic pentathlon at Olympia, Greece, a blunt javelin would be launched at about 45 degrees, but in war or the chase, a sharp weapon was thrown much closer to the horizontal. Javelins and their amenta were used both on foot and from horseback. The amentum was attached firmly, at or near the centre of gravity of the shaft. By putting the amentum behind the centre of gravity it is possible to increase the distance thrown, but at the sacrifice of accuracy. Hence the amentum was detachable, and the athlete fastened it to suit his taste shortly before use. The winding of the amentum added rotation and therefore accuracy to the projectile, similar to the effect of rifling on a bullet. The experiments conducted by H. A. Harris support the theories based on vase paintings of the proper use of an amentum.Harris, H.A. (1963) \\"Greek Javelin Throwing\\", in Greece & Rome, Second Series, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Mar., 1963), pp. 26-36. Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association. Retrieved 21 September 2013. Performance enhancement In experiments made by General Reffye for Emperor Napoleon, a javelin that could be thrown only 20 metres by hand could be thrown 80 metres with the amentum. More recent experiments have failed to replicate this level of enhancement, with well-designed tests, showing only a 58% improvement on average. S.R. MURRAY, W.A. SANDS, N.A. KECK, and D.A. O'ROARK Efficacy of the Ankyle in Increasing the Distance of the Ancient Greek Javelin Throw in: Nikephoros, 23, 2010, 329-333. The advantages of the amentum are the high precision for fast- flying light javelins, and a less demanding construction than atlatl darts. Parallels Similar throwing straps were used on light javelins throughout Europe. Italian, Gaulish, and Iberian troops used them before and after the Roman conquests, they are mentioned in an ancient Irish story, and remains have been found on spears in the Nydam bog finds, where some appear to have been permanently fastened with studs. A similar device was used in New Caledonia, but in the rest of the world, the spear-thrower was the usual device for increasing the speed and range of light javelins.

Her education continued at New Hall (now Murray Edwards College), University of Cambridge (BA, first-class honours, 1973), and at Harvard Divinity School (ThM, 1975), to which she went as a Harkness Fellow. Her PhD on Ernst Troeltsch is also from the University of Cambridge (1983). Career =Academic career= Coakley has taught at Lancaster University (1976‚Äì1991), Oriel College, Oxford (1991‚Äì1993) and Harvard University in the divinity school (1993‚Äì2007; as Mallinckrodt Professor of Divinity, 1995‚Äì2007). She was a visiting professor of religion at Princeton University (2003‚Äì2004). In 2006, she was elected the Norris‚ÄìHulse Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge (the first woman appointed to this chair) and took up the position in 2007. In 2011, she became deputy chair of the School of Arts and Humanities with a four-year appointment on the general board of the university. She stepped down as Norris‚ÄìHulse Professor in 2018 and was made professor emeritus. She has been an honorary professor of the University of St Andrews since 2018 and a visiting professorial fellow at the Australian Catholic University since 2019. Coakley's teaching and research interests cover a number of disciplines cognate to systematic theology, including the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of science, patristics, feminist theory and the intersections of law and medicine with religion. Her contributions to these areas have generally been by way of co-ordinating research projects and editing or co- editing collections of papers. It was through these collaborative projects that her profile gained a level of international prominence. At the time of her appointment to the Norris‚ÄìHulse chair in Cambridge, Coakley had not published a monograph subsequent to the 1988 publication of her doctoral thesis. She has been working on a four-volume systematic theology, the first volume of which was published in 2013 as God, Sexuality and the Self: An Essay 'On the Trinity. From 2005 to 2008, Coakley co-directed, with Martin A. Nowak, the \\"Evolution and Theology of Cooperation\\" project at Harvard University sponsored by the Templeton Foundation, out of which has come a co-edited volume, Evolution, Games, and God: The Principle of Cooperation. An earlier interdisciplinary project on \\"Pain and Its Transformations\\", undertaken with Arthur Kleinman at Harvard (as part of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Initiative), produced Pain and Its Transformations: The Interface of Biology and Culture (co-ed. with Kay Kaufman Shelemay, Harvard UP, 2007). Coakley delivered the Gifford Lectures in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 2012. She holds honorary degrees from Lund University, St Andrews, University of St Michael's College, Toronto, and Heythrop College, London. In July 2019, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. =Ordained ministry= Coakley was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 2000 and as a priest in 2001. She has assisted in parishes in Waban, Massachusetts, and at the Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore, Oxford, England (where she served her title). Her training for the priesthood included periods working in a hospital and a prison. In 2011 she was appointed an honorary canon of Ely Cathedral where she assists with the morning office and Eucharist. (Note: as at June 2019, Ely Cathedral no longer lists Coakley as an honorary canon.) In 2012, she was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to change Church of England rules to allow women to become bishops. Personal life In 1975, Coakley married J. F. Coakley, a Syriac scholar and fine printer. They have two daughters, Edith Coakley Stowe and Agnes Coakley Cox, who attended Buckingham Browne & Nichols school in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her brother is a legal adviser to Prince Charles. Her father, a wealthy lawyer and bon viveur, died in September 2016.

He was designated a Member of the Italian Senate in 1923, and ennobled as Conte della Vetta in 1937.  Pre- World War I activism  Born into a nationalistically oriented family (that rejected the Austrian domination of his Trentino and supported the Italian irredentism), after his studies in Florence and Rome Tolomei became associated with the nationalistic Dante Alighieri Society. After graduation in 1888 he taught in Italian schools at Tunis, Thessaloniki, ƒ∞zmir and Cairo. He returned to Italy in 1901 and was appointed Inspector General of Italian Schools Abroad by the Foreign Ministry's Office. His nationalistic activities had begun in 1890 with the founding of the weekly magazine La Nazione Italiana (The Italian Nation), a propagandistic publication whose aim was to popularize the positions of the Dante Alighieri Society.Framke 1987, p. 43. Its articles dwelled mainly on the issue of Trento and Trieste, then still under Austro- Hungarian rule, but covered other areas including the Levant and North Africa, anticipating the fascist dream of a new Mediterranean empire. As the end of the century neared, Tolomei's activities began to focus on the northern boundaries of Italy. To him, this natural boundary was the main watershed of the Alps near Reschen Pass and Brenner Pass, even though few Italians lived in this mostly German-speaking area of the Austrian Empire. In this early phase, he saw the Ladins (a group speaking a Rhaeto-Romance language which inhabited the mountainous areas in what was then the eastern part of Southern Tyrol, a territory now divided between South Tyrol, Trentino and the province of Belluno) as the Latin element through which \\"an Italian-Ladinic wedgeSteininger 2003, p. 15.\\" could be driven into the Germanic-speaking region, which in those days he called Alto Trentino - Upper Trentino, not having yet devised the name Alto Adige - High Adige, a creation which would become the official Italian designation for the province after World War I up to this day.Gianni Faustini, \\"Facevo il giornalista\\". Appunti e notizie autobiografiche sull'attivit√† giornalistica di Ettore Tolomei. In Sergio Benvenuti, Christoph H. von Hartungen (eds.) 1998, p. 169. In 1904 Tolomei climbed the high Klockerkarkopf or Glockenkarkopf, which he believed to be the northernmost mountain on the main watershed in the Tyrolean Alps. In fact, the northernmost point of the Adrian drainage basin is not the Klockerkarkopf, but the nearby Western Zwillingsk√∂pfl. Tolomei claimed to be the first climber and renamed the peak Vetta d'Italia - Summit of Italy (with a clear political aim), although Franz Hofer and Fritz K√∂gl had already climbed it in 1895. page 318 It is not clear whether Tolomei was aware of K√∂gl's ascent or not, although an extensive article about it had appeared in the Austrian Alpine Club magazine. Italian maps later adopted this name. According to a legend U.S President Woodrow Wilson, for this reason believed that South Tyrol was an Italian land . In 1938 Tolomei was given the title \\"Conte della Vetta\\" (Count of the Summit) by the Italian King Vittorio Emanuele III. To further his goals, in 1906 Tolomei founded the Archivio per l'Alto Adige, a magazine which moved along the same propagandistic lines as La Nazione Italiana, but focused solely on the South Tyrolean issue. The Archivio propagated the Italianness of South Tyrol in articles that claimed scientific authority and objectivity, but were in fact deeply tinged with ideology and propagandistic intent, and for Tolomei a tool for personal promotion and narcissistic gratification.Ferrandi 1986, p. 26. An important instrument in the struggle for the Italianization of South Tyrol, apart from the scholarly articles in the Archivio per l'Alto Adige which soon enjoyed a large readership in Italy, was the creation of an Italian name for every village and geographical feature in South Tyrol. As World War I neared, toponymy assumed increasing importance. The toponymic studies were presented as a re-Italianization of names which, according to Tolomei and his collaborators, had been Germanized not many generations before.Cristina Fait, Per la verit√† ed il diritto d'Italia. Archeologia e \\"Idea di Romanit√†\\" nell'Alto Adige dall'inizio del Novecento fino alla seconda guerra mondiale. In Sergio Benvenuti, Christoph H. von Hartungen (eds.) 1998, pp. 149-150. The result of these activities, called Prontuario dei nomi locali dell'Alto Adige, would be published in 1916 by the Reale Societ√† Geografica Italiana la prima . Activities during World War I In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Tolomei fled to Rome in order to avoid being drafted by the Austrian army. By this time, he had succeeded in giving the region between the Brenner pass and the Salurner Klause an appearance of Italianness. The Archivio had become the reference work for all matters regarding South Tyrol, and during the war became the sole source of information for Italians. The idea of an Italian legal entitlement to South Tyrol had become generally accepted.Steininger 2003, pp. 16‚Äì17. As Italy joined the war on the side of the Allies in 1915, Tolomei joined the Italian armed forces under the pseudonym \\"Eugenio Treponti\\", to avoid being executed as a traitor if caught by the Austrians. He was immediately assigned to the Chiefs of Staff committee.Maurizio Ferrandi, Scheda biografica. Biographische √úbersicht. In Benvenuti, v. Hartungen 1998, p. 182. The Archivio continued to appear as Serie di Guerra ‚Äì War series, printed in Rome. The spectrum of the topics changed, and most articles were now written by Tolomei himself. As a result, the magazine's propagandistic intentions became more obvious. From 1915 onwards, Tolomei increased his lobbying activities, sending several letters to government officials and nationalistic associations detailing his views on the steps to be taken for and after the annexation of South Tyrol. He anticipated that German speakers would assimilate to the Italian language and culture, although there were already thoughts of a possible resettlement. Also in 1915, he published his programmatic points for the \\"annexation and adaptation\\" of South Tyrol in the Archivio per l'Alto Adige. In its Volume 11 of 1916 appeared the Prontuario dei nomi locali dell'Alto Adige, a translation of over 10,000 village and place names. \\"[...] for the first time, the entirety of the indigenous nomenclature of place names, including the names of geographical features and farmsteads, were transformed into another language through one man's act of will\\".Steininger 2003, p. 17. In 1916 and 1917, he collaborated with the Istituto Geografico De Agostini (now De Agostini) to prepare maps for the region which would show it as being part of Italy. These maps were used by the Italian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, strengthening the impression that this was really an old Italian region. After the occupation of Tyrol by Italian troops, Tolomei vigorously advocated decisive measures to radically alter the ethnic situation so that South Tyrol would become permanently Italian. Although he was nominated Commissario alla Lingua ed alla Cultura in Alto Adige - Commissioner for language and culture in Alto Adige, during the first postwar years his suggestions were not received well by the liberal administration. His big moment would only arrive with the fascist takeover of the Italian state.Steininger 2003, p. 18 Post-World War I career Street sign in Innsbruck, North Tyrol, commemorating the city of Bozen, set up in 1923 in response to the prohibition of the original southern Tyrolean place names. Shortly after Italian troops had occupied the southern part of Tyrol in the wake of the Austrian-Italian Armistice of Villa Giusti in November 1918 (which was confirmed by the Treaty of St. Germain in 1919), Tolomei was appointed to a cultural office in the main city of the area, Bozen (Bolzano). On 2 October 1922, Tolomei led a group of Blackshirts when they occupied the town hall of Bolzano and managed to persuade the Civil commissioner Luigi Credaro to depose the mayor; the following day they moved to Trento and, using similar tactics, obtained the suppression of the administrative Provincial assembly and, after Credaro's and minister Salandra's dismissals that of the entire Central office for the new provinces. It was 'de facto' the end of all democratic policies in the area of Trentino- Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol between the wars: supported by Benito Mussolini, Tolomei enforced his policy of Italianization from 1923 onwards. The names of some 8,000 towns and places were changed, and Italian was made the only official language. His program totalled 32 points, publicly presented by Tolomei in Bolzano's Civic Theatre in July 1923,Sabrina Michielli, Hannes Obermair (eds): BZ ‚Äô18‚Äì‚Äô45: ein Denkmal, eine Stadt, zwei Diktaturen. Begleitband zur Dokumentations-Ausstellung im Bozener Siegesdenkmal. Vienna-Bozen/Bolzano: Folio Verlag 2016. , p. 134. of which some of the most salient were: * prohibition of the name \\"Tirol\\", and any variation of the same; * closure of German-language schools; * dissolution of parties specific to the German- speaking community; * imposition of Italian as the only official language; * closure of German-language press. In 1939, his work led to the South Tyrol Option Agreement that forced people to choose between remaining in Italy or emigrating to the Third Reich, the so-called \\"Option f√ºr Deutschland\\". In 1943, when Italy surrendered, he was seized by German forces and deported, first to the Dachau concentration camp then to a sanatorium in Thuringia. Because of his policies of enforcing Italian names on towns in South Tyrol, he is denigrated as \\"the gravedigger of South Tyrol\\" by the German-speaking group in the area.

Its properties can differ significantly from those of terrestrial soil. The physical properties of lunar soil are primarily the result of mechanical disintegration of basaltic and anorthositic rock, caused by continual meteoric impacts and bombardment by solar and interstellar charged atomic particles over years. The process is largely one of mechanical weathering in which the particles are ground to finer and finer size over time. This situation contrasts fundamentally to terrestrial soil formation, mediated by the presence of molecular oxygen (O2), humidity, atmospheric wind, and a robust array of contributing biological processes. Some have argued that the term soil is not correct in reference to the Moon because on Earth, soil is defined as having organic content, whereas the Moon has none. However, standard usage among lunar scientists ignores that distinction. Lunar soil typically refers to only the finer fraction of lunar regolith, which is composed of grains 1 cm in diameter or less, but is often used interchangeably. Lunar dust generally connotes even finer materials than lunar soil. There is no official definition as to what size fraction constitutes \\"dust\\"; some place the cutoff at less than 50 Œºm in diameter, while others put it at less than 10 Œºm. Formation processes Orange soil found on Apollo 17, the result of volcanic glass beads The major processes involved in the formation of lunar soil are: *Comminution: mechanical breaking of rocks and minerals into smaller particles by meteorite and micrometeorite impacts; *Agglutination: welding of mineral and rock fragments together by micrometeorite-impact-produced glass; *Solar wind sputtering and cosmic ray spallation caused by impacts of ions and high energy particles. These processes continue to change the physical and optical properties of the soil over time, and it is known as space weathering. In addition, fire fountaining, whereby volcanic lava is lofted and cools into small glass beads before falling back to the surface, can create small but important deposits in some locations, such as the orange soil found at Shorty Crater in the Taurus- Littrow valley by Apollo 17, and the green glass found at Hadley-Apennine by Apollo 15. Deposits of volcanic beads are also thought to be the origin of Dark Mantle Deposits (DMD) in other locations around the Moon. Mineralogy and composition Lunar soil is composed of various types of particles including rock fragments, mono-mineralic fragments, and various kinds of glasses including agglutinate particles, volcanic and impact spherules. The agglutinates form at the lunar surface by micrometeorite impacts that cause small-scale melting which fuses adjacent materials together with tiny specks of metallic iron (Fe0) embedded in each dust particle's glassy shell. Over time, material is mixed both vertically and horizontally (a process known as \\"gardening\\") by impact processes. However, the contribution of material from external sources is relatively minor, such that the soil composition at any given location largely reflects the local bedrock composition. There are two profound differences in the chemistry of lunar regolith and soil from terrestrial materials. The first is that the Moon is very dry. As a result, those minerals with water as part of their structure (mineral hydration) such as clay, mica, and amphiboles are totally absent from the Moon. The second difference is that lunar regolith and crust are chemically reduced, rather than being significantly oxidized like the Earth's crust. In the case of the regolith, this is due in part to the constant bombardment of the lunar surface with protons (i.e. hydrogen (H) nuclei) from the solar wind. One consequence is that iron on the Moon is found in the metallic 0 and +2 oxidation states, whereas on Earth iron is found primarily in the +2 and +3 oxidation states.

The potential for construction of structures, ground transportation networks, and waste disposal systems, to name a few examples, will depend on real-world experimental data obtained from testing lunar soil samples. The load-carrying capability of the soil is an important parameter in the design of such structures on Earth. Due to myriad meteorite impacts (with velocities in the range of 20 km/s), the lunar surface is covered with a thin layer of dust. The dust is electrically charged and sticks to any surface with which it comes in contact. The density of lunar regolith is about 1.5 g/cm3.Lunar Regolith @NASA The soil becomes very dense beneath the top layer of regolith. Other factors which may affect the properties of lunar soil include large temperature differentials, the presence of a hard vacuum, and the absence of a significant lunar magnetic field, thereby allowing charged solar wind particles to continuously hit the surface of the Moon. Moon dust fountains and electrostatic levitation There is some evidence that the Moon may have a tenuous atmosphere of moving dust particles constantly leaping up from and falling back to the Moon's surface, giving rise to a \\"dust atmosphere\\" that looks static but is composed of dust particles in constant motion. The term \\"Moon fountain\\" has been used to describe this effect by analogy with the stream of molecules of water in a fountain following a ballistic trajectory while appearing static due to the constancy of the stream. According to a model proposed in 2005 by the Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, this is caused by electrostatic levitation. On the daylit side of the Moon, solar ultraviolet and X-ray radiation is energetic enough to knock electrons out of atoms and molecules in the lunar soil. Positive charges build up until the tiniest particles of lunar dust (measuring 1 micrometre and smaller) are repelled from the surface and lofted anywhere from metres to kilometres high, with the smallest particles reaching the highest altitudes. Eventually they fall back toward the surface where the process is repeated. On the night side, the dust is negatively charged by electrons from the solar wind. Indeed, the fountain model suggests that the night side would achieve greater voltage differences than the day side, possibly launching dust particles to higher velocities and altitudes.Moon Fountains This effect could be further enhanced during the portion of the Moon's orbit where it passes through Earth's magnetotail; see Magnetic field of the Moon for more detail.NASA - The Moon and the Magnetotail On the terminator there could be significant horizontal electric fields forming between the day and night areas, resulting in horizontal dust transport - a form of \\"Moon storm\\". Lunar \\"twilight rays\\" sketched by Apollo 17 astronauts This effect was anticipated in 1956 by science fiction author Hal Clement in his short story \\"Dust Rag\\", published in Astounding Science Fiction. A piece of regolith from Apollo 11 presented to the Soviet Union and exhibited in the Memorial Museum of Astronautics in Moscow There is some evidence for this effect. In the early 1960s, Surveyor 7Strange Things Happen at Full MoonLiveScience and several prior Surveyor spacecraft that soft-landed on the Moon returned photographs showing an unmistakable twilight glow low over the lunar horizon persisting after the Sun had set. Moreover, the distant horizon between land and sky did not look razor-sharp, as would have been expected in a vacuum where there was no atmospheric haze. Apollo 17 astronauts orbiting the Moon in 1972 repeatedly saw and sketched what they variously called \\"bands,\\" \\"streamers\\" or \\"twilight rays\\" for about 10 seconds before lunar sunrise or lunar sunset. Such rays were also reported by astronauts aboard Apollo 8, 10, and 15. These may have been similar to crepuscular rays on Earth. Apollo 17 also placed an experiment on the Moon's surface called LEAM, short for Lunar Ejecta and Meteorites. It was designed to look for dust kicked up by small meteoroids hitting the Moon's surface. It had three sensors that could record the speed, energy, and direction of tiny particles: one each pointing up, east, and west. LEAM saw a large number of particles every morning, mostly coming from the east or west‚Äîrather than above or below‚Äîand mostly slower than speeds expected for lunar ejecta. In addition, the experiment's temperature increased to near 100 degrees Celsius a few hours after each lunar sunrise, so the unit had to be turned off temporarily because it was overheating. It is speculated that this could have been a result of electrically-charged moondust sticking to LEAM, darkening its surface so the experiment package absorbed rather than reflected sunlight. However, scientists were unable to make a definite determination of the source of the problem, as LEAM operated only briefly before the Apollo program ended.Trudy E. Bell, Stronger Than Dirt, Air & Space Smithsonian, August/September 2006, pp. 46‚Äì53 It is possible that these storms have been spotted from Earth: For centuries, there have been reports of strange glowing lights on the Moon, known as \\"Transient lunar phenomena\\" or TLPs. Some TLPs have been observed as momentary flashes, now generally accepted to be visible evidence of meteoroids impacting the lunar surface. But others have appeared as amorphous reddish or whitish glows or even as dusky hazy regions that change shape or disappear over seconds or minutes. These may have been a result of sunlight reflecting from suspended lunar dust. Harmful effects of lunar dust A 2005 NASA study listed 20 risks that required further study before humans should commit to a human Mars expedition, and ranked \\"dust\\" as the #1 challenge. The report urged study of its mechanical properties, corrosiveness, grittiness, and effect on electrical systems. Most scientists think the only way to answer the questions definitively is by returning samples of Martian soil and rock to Earth well before launching any astronauts. Although that report addressed Martian dust, the concerns are equally valid concerning lunar dust. The dust found on the lunar surface could cause harmful effects on any human outpost technology and crew members: * Darkening of surfaces, leading to a considerable increase in radiative heat transfer; * Abrasive nature of the dust particles may rub and wear down surfaces through friction; * Negative effect on coatings used on gaskets to seal equipment from space, optical lenses, solar panels, and windows as well as wiring; * Possible damage to an astronaut's lungs, nervous, and cardiovascular systems; * Possible increased risk of spacesuit arcing due to small dust grains' exposure to the space environment. The principles of astronautical hygiene should be used to assess the risks of exposure to lunar dust during exploration on the Moon's surface and thereby determine the most appropriate measures to control exposure. These may include removing the spacesuit in a three-stage airlock, \\"vacuuming\\" the suit with a magnetProfessor Larry Taylor, Director of the Planetary Geosciences Institute at the University of Tennessee before removal, and using local exhaust ventilation with a high‚Äìefficiency particulate filter to remove dust from the spacecraft's atmosphere.Dr. J. R. Cain ‚Äì \\"The application of astronautical hygiene to protect the health of astronauts\\", UK Space Biomedicine Association Conference 2009, Downing College, University of Cambridge The harmful properties of lunar dust are not well known. However, based on studies of dust found on Earth, it is expected that exposure to lunar dust will result in greater risks to health both from direct exposure (acute) and if exposure is over time (chronic). This is because lunar dust is more chemically reactive and has larger surface areas composed of sharper jagged edges than Earth dust.Dr. John R. Cain, \\"Moon dust - a danger to lunar explorers\\", Spaceflight, Vol. 52, February 2010, pp. 60‚Äì65 If the chemical reactive particles are deposited in the lungs, they may cause respiratory disease. Long-term exposure to the dust may cause a more serious respiratory disease similar to silicosis. During lunar exploration, the astronauts' spacesuits will become contaminated with lunar dust. The dust will be released into the atmosphere when the suits are removed. The methods used to mitigate exposure will include providing high air recirculation rates in the airlock, the use of a \\"Double Shell Spacesuit\\", the use of dust shields, the use of high‚Äìgrade magnetic separation, and the use of solar flux to sinter and melt the regolith.Dr. John R. Cain, \\"Lunar dust: the hazard and astronaut exposure risks\\", Earth, Moon, Planets October 2010. =Present availability= The Apollo astronauts brought back some of lunar rocks from six landing sites. Although this material has been isolated in vacuum-packed bottles, it is now unusable for detailed chemical or mechanical analysis‚Äîthe gritty particles deteriorated the knife-edge indium seals of the vacuum bottles; air has slowly leaked in. Every sample brought back from the Moon has been contaminated by Earth's air and humidity. The dust has acquired a patina of rust, and, as a result of bonding with terrestrial water and oxygen molecules, its chemical reactivity is long gone. The chemical and electrostatic properties of the soil no longer match what future astronauts will encounter on the Moon. Moon dust-contaminated items finally became available to the public in 2014, when the US government approvedNew Law says astronauts can keep (or sell) their space artifacts. the sale of private material owned, and collected, by astronauts. Since then only one item has been produced for sale with genuine Moon dust collected after the item spent over 32 hours on the Moon. A luggage strap, exposed to the elements of the Moon for 32 hours, a piece of Charles \\"Pete\\" Conrad's spacesuit on the Apollo 12 mission, was sold by his estate to a private purchaser at auction.Apollo 12 astronaut's mementos up for auction 23 April 2014 In 2017 lunar soil collected by Neil Armstrong in 1969 was put up for auction. While many jewelry- and watch-makers claim their product contains \\"Moon dust\\", the products only contain pieces of, or dust from, meteorites believed to have originated from the Moon. On 11 September 2020, NASA announced that it is willing to create a market for Lunar soil by calling out for proposals to purchase the Lunar soil from commercial suppliers.

Plaster veneer was developed as a way of taking advantage of the reduced labor of modern drywall, while providing a genuine plaster surface for a wall. Applications In much of the world, plaster veneer is a very rare wall surface. Consequently, it can be difficult to find a local trade worker skilled in the practice. However, in some regions, such as Ireland, or Massachusetts this situation is reversed, with plaster veneer a common standard, and mud-and-tape the less common alternative. Unpainted, tinted plaster veneer. Plaster veneer is well-suited to the renovation of older buildings, since it is an easier option than full re-creation of the original lath and plaster. The veneer surface will closely mimic antique walls, with their hand-applied variations. In contrast, properly finished mud-and-tape drywall can be very planar, and industrially uniform in character. Drywall feels relatively warm and soft to the touch, while plaster feels cooler and very hard. Consequently, plaster veneer might be an appropriate choice in the renovation of an older house with existing lath-and-plaster walls. Bare mud- and-tape drywall is generally only acceptable as a final decorating finish in utility spaces such as attics or garages. In most rooms, such walls are finished with paint or wallpaper. Plaster veneer walls are usually similarly decorated, but unpainted plaster can also serve as a finish. Because bare plaster can be appealing to the touch, and paint would add an additional layer, some decorators opt to leave exposed plaster in some or all of a room, as a creative choice. In such cases, if the plaster's natural color is not desired, tints can be added as part of the mixing process, or can be introduced unevenly for artistic color effects. Methodology A plaster veneer wall being troweled smooth. The plaster veneer method begins with the hanging of specially designated drywall (\\"blueboard\\"), in the conventional manner., N.B. In North America, the color of the face paper of drywall indicates its intended application: white for standard, green for moisture resistance, etc. Plaster veneer wallboard is blue or gray . Plaster veneer may also be applied to ordinary drywall, or over existing walls, but this requires \\"gluing\\" the existing wall surface by painting on a special adhesive compound, and then applying a thin layer of \\"base coat\\" plaster. After the blueboard or base coat covers the interior of a room, the finishing plaster is mixed in batches (typically about 5 gallons), by blending plaster powder with water, to the ideal consistency. Working quickly, a thin layer (usually one to three millimeters) of finish plaster is applied over a wall face before the plaster begins to congeal in the bucket. Over a period of a few hours, as the plaster chemically sets on the wall, it is periodically smoothed or textured using hand trowels, until the desired finish is achieved. When a wall face has sufficiently set, an adjoining face can be safely applied. After the plaster has fully set, it is allowed to cure for a period of days to weeks, permitting excess moisture to escape into the air. If the plaster is no more than about three millimeters thick, two to three days' cure time is usually sufficient. A skilled eye can see areas where moisture is lingering until the curing is complete. After the walls are fully cured, they are ideal for painting or papering. Advantages of plaster veneer Some considerations favor plaster veneer over mud-and-tape drywall. *Moisture resistance: Once cured, plaster is an effective water barrier. By contrast, unprotected drywall and joint compound absorb water, causing sagging, bloating, or complete structural failure. As a consequence of plaster's inherent water shedding properties, it is a very effective water and mildew barrier. *No sanding: Plaster is typically applied in one work session per wall or per several non-adjoining walls. The smoothness or texture is achieved by working the plaster as it sets, over a period of up to five hours. By contrast, drywall is typically sanded or otherwise mechanically smoothed as the final step of the wall surfacing process. The fine dust particles created can be difficult to clean and dangerous to breathe. *Pleasing surface: Bare plaster can be a beautiful interior surface. The natural color of veneer plaster is a mottled white. When applied for maximum smoothness, it can result in a hard, mirror-like surface, which masks the mechanical uniformity of the drywall with the subtly organic form of a hand-applied layer. Tinting can be added to the wet plaster for color effects. *Durable surface: Plaster veneer results in a harder and more durable surface than drywall. Scuffs and gouges are less likely. *Quicker: The overall calendar time from beginning to end for a plaster veneer project is typically slightly shorter than for conventional drywall.(N.B. The overall labor time is usually less with mud-and-tape drywall.) This is because drywall joint compound is applied in at least three phases, followed by sanding. Some drywall joint compounds (\\"hot mud\\") set chemically, allowing rapid re-coating, but these compounds can make sanding more difficult. By contrast, each wall in a plaster veneer project is applied as a single task, and allowed to set and cure without intervention. Disadvantages of plaster veneer Some considerations make plaster veneer a less appropriate choice than mud-and-tape drywall. *Rare technique: In most locales, there are few trade professionals with the skills for plaster veneer. Where drywall is much more common, it can be difficult even to acquire plastering tools and materials from local suppliers. After a wall is surfaced with plaster, any future work on that wall should ideally be done by a craftsperson familiar with plaster veneer. *Application time commitment: Once a plaster wall is begun, it must be completed before the worker can stop. This time commitment makes scheduling each task more critical, and can cause a worker to end the work day early or late. *Cure time: There is only a 24-hour wait time to decorate over \\"one coat\\" veneer. Cure time is only for two or three coat plastering that may have lime in the finish. It is recommended to wait a few days or weeks before painting a lime finish wall. Plastering walls with one coat is actually faster than taping since you don't have to wait for three separate coats to dry for 24 hours, as in taping. If heavy patchwork is involved, then yes, there is also a wait time. However, that is typically for drying time not curing. *More expensive: In comparable settings, the costs of plaster veneer walls is higher than mud-and-tape drywall walls. That is, a skilled tradesman working start to finish at full efficiency can surface mud-and-tape with somewhat less labor than with plaster veneer. Additionally, plaster veneer uses significantly more plaster material than the amount of joint compound in a typical mud-and-tape wall.

She preferred to deal with complex number fields and integers, rather than the more abstract aspects of the theory.  Biography  She was born in Samara, Russian Empire, but her father's job as a representative with a Russian sugar company moved the family to Harbin, China in 1910. Emma was tutored at home until the age of 14, when a school was opened locally. She managed to make her way to the USA for her higher education. At UC Berkeley, she started out in engineering in 1924, but found her niche in mathematics. One of her professors was Derrick N. Lehmer, the number theorist well known for his work on prime number tables and factorizations. While working for him at Berkeley finding pseudosquares, she met his son, her future husband Derrick H. Lehmer. Upon her graduation summa cum laude with a B.A. in Mathematics (1928), Emma married the younger Lehmer. They moved to Brown University, where Emma received her M.Sc., and Derrick his Ph.D., both in 1930. Emma did not obtain a Ph.D. herself. Most universities had nepotism rules which prevented husband and wife from both holding teaching positions, although Emma claimed there were many advantages to not holding a Ph.D. The Lehmers had two children, Laura (1932) and Donald (1934). Contributions Lehmer did independent mathematical work, including a translation from Russian to English of Pontryagin's book Topological Groups. She worked closely with her husband on many projects; 21 of her 56 publications were joint work with him. Her publications were mainly in number theory and computation, with emphasis on reciprocity laws, special primes, and congruences.

Widely considered among his finest works, it illustrates a popular local legend of his time. An exceptionally large painting, it is divided into two sections, heavenly above and terrestrial below, but it gives little impression of duality, since the upper and lower sections are brought together compositionally. The painting has been lauded by art scholars, characterized, inter alia, as \\"one of the most truthful pages in the history of Spain\\", as a masterpiece of Western art and of late Mannerism, and as the epitome of Greco's artistic style.M. Lambraki-Plaka, A Tribute to El Greco, 81 * F. Philipp, \\"El Greco's Entombment\\", 88‚Äì89 * S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 1 Theme The theme of the painting is inspired by a legend of the beginning of the 14th century. In 1312, a certain Don Gonzalo Ruiz de Toledo, mayor of the town of Orgaz, died (his family later received the title of Count, by which he is generally and posthumously known). Don Gonzalo Ruiz de Toledo was a descendant of the noble Palaiologos family, which produced the last ruling dynasty of the Byzantine Empire. A pious Caballero, the Count of Orgaz was also a philanthropist, who, among other charitable acts, left a sum of money for the enlargement and adornment of the church of Santo Tom√© (El Greco's parish church), where he wanted to be buried.D.F. Gonz√°lez, Gonzalo Ruiz de Toledo, 213 * M. Lambraki-Plaka, A Tribute to El Greco, 74 * S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 1‚Äì4, 7 According to the legend, at the time the Count was murdered, Saint Stephen and Saint Augustine descended in person from the heavens and buried him with their own hands in front of the dazzled eyes of those present. The event is depicted in the painting, with every detail of the work's subject described in the contract signed between Greco and the Church. The miracle is also mentioned in the Latin epitaphian inscription, set into the wall below the painting.M. Lambrakis-Plaka, El Greco-The Greek, 54‚Äì55 * S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 1 Although Greco abided by the terms of the contract, he introduced some elements which \\"modernized\\" the legend, such as a series of features attributed to a 16th century customary funeral procession, the vestments of the two saints, as well as the depiction of eminent Toledan figures of his time. The \\"modernization\\" of the legend serves the didactic purpose of the painting, which, in accord with the Counter-Reformation doctrines, stresses the importance of both the veneration of saints and of good deeds for the salvation of the soul.S.

Greco must have worked at a frantic pace, and finished the painting between late 1587 and the spring of 1588. A long debate between the priests and the painter followed in relation to the value of the latter's work, for which the contract stipulated that it would be determined by appraisal.R.L.

Kagan, \\"El Greco and the Law\\", 85‚Äì86 * M. Lambraki-Plaka, A Tribute to El Greco, 75 * F. Philipp, \\"El Greco's Entombment\\", 77 Already in 1588, people were flocking to Santo Tom√© to see the painting. This immediate popular reception was mainly due to the realistic portrayal of the notable men of Toledo of the time.M. Lambraki-Plaka, El Greco-The Greek, 54 It was the custom for the eminent and noble men of the town to assist the burial of the noble-born, and it was stipulated in the contract that the scene should be represented in this manner.Web Gallery of Art, The Burial of the Count of Orgaz El Greco would pay homage to the aristocracy of the spirit, the clergy, the jurists, the poets and the scholars, who honored him and his art with their esteem, by immortalizing them in the painting. The Burial of the Count of Orgaz has been admired not only for its art, but also because it is a gallery of portraits of some of the most important personalities of that time in Toledo. In 1612, Francisco de Pisa wrote: \\"The people of our city never grow tired, because [...] there are realistic portraits of many notable men of our times.\\"S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 2 Analysis of the painting Detail of the painting. According to the terms stipulated in the contract and the prevailing scholarly approach, the painting is divided into two zones, juxtaposing the earthly with the heavenly world, which are brought together compositionally (e.g., by the standing figures, by their varied participation in the earthly and heavenly event, by the torches, cross etc.).M. Lambraki-Plaka, A Tribute to El Greco, 76 * S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 7 * Franz Philipp emphasizes the element of the assumption of the soul (assumptio animae), and argues that the work should be considered as tripartite: the central division of the painting is occupied by the assumptio animae, in the form of a newborn, \\"ethereal\\" baby.F. Philipp, \\"El Greco's Entombment\\", 78‚Äì82 Augustine's perception of the soul and its ascent, which evolved from a Neoplatonic basis, is a possible inspiration for the painter's imagery of assumptio animae.D. Davies, \\"El Greco & the Reform Movements in Spain\\", 70 Greco's way of thematically and artistically linking the upper with the lower zone of the painting has been characterized by art scholars as ingenuous, and as further accomplishing the main message of the painting, that veneration and good works lead to salvation.S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 7, 9 In the upper part, the heavenly one, the clouds have parted to receive the \\"righteous man\\" in Paradise. Heaven is evoked by swirling icy clouds, semiabstract in their shape, and the saints are tall and phantomlike. Christ, clad in white and in glory, is a radiance of light, and the crowning point of the triangle formed by the figures of the Madonna and Saint John the Baptist in the traditional Orthodox composition of the Deesis.M. Lambraki-Plaka, El Greco-The Greek, 55 * D. Davies, \\"El Greco & the Reform Movements in Spain\\", 70 * S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 9 These three central figures of heavenly glory are surrounded by apostles, martyrs, Biblical figures (including Moses, Noah and David) as well as Philip II of Spain, though he was still alive. The \\"righteous\\" Philip II is spiritually united with Christ and the heavenly creatures in a City of God as conceived by Augustine. The heavenly and terrestrial land both blend together in an amazing fashion, but there is little sense of duality. In the central part of the composition, an angel powerfully pushes the nascent soul upwards, a movement interpreted once again as a visualization of the Counter-Reformation teaching of salvation.E.A. Mar√©, \\"The Being and Movement of the Angel\\", passim The scene of the miracle is depicted in the lower part of the composition, in the terrestrial section, where all is normal as regards the scale and proportions of the figures. Saint Augustine, bearing the characteristics of Gaspar de Quiroga y Vela, the Archbishop of Toledo, and Saint Stephen, in golden and red vestments respectively, bend reverently over the body of the count, who is clad in magnificent armor that reflects the yellow and reds of the other figures. The armor is contemporary with Greco's time, and inspired by the ceremonial military dress of the Spanish royals as depicted in Titian's portraits.M. Lambraki-Plaka, A Tribute to El Greco, 76, 78 The noblemen contemplate the event in a detached and restrained manner. Their subdued composure has been interpreted either as another visual element of the didactic purpose of the painting under the Counter-Reformation influence or as an expression of the Byzantine origins of Greco's art.M. Lambraki-Plaka, A Tribute to El Greco, 76 * S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 7 The young boy at the left is El Greco's son, Jorge Manuel; on a handkerchief in his pocket is inscribed the artist's signature and the date 1578, the year of the boy's birth. Jorge Manuel's inclusion emphasizes the didactic purpose of the painting: the boy occupies a prominent position close to the spectator's view, directing the latter with his pointing finger.S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 3 The artist himself can be recognised directly above the raised hand of a knight of the Order of Santiago.M. Lambraki-Plaka, A Tribute to El Greco, 78 * Web Gallery of Art, The Burial of the Count of Orgaz The painting has a chromatic harmony that is very rich, expressive and radiant. On the black mourning garments of the nobles are projected the gold-embroidered vestments, thus creating an intense ceremonial character. In the heavenly space there is a predominance of transparent harmonies of iridescence and ivoried greys, which harmonize with the gilded ochres, while in the Madonna's maphorion (mantle) deep blue is closely combined with bright red. The rhetoric of the expressions, the glances and the gestural translation make the scene very moving.M. Lambraki-Plaka, El Greco-The Greek, 55‚Äì56 Influences The Dormition of the Virgin. The Dormition was suggested as the compositional model for The Burial of the Count of Orgaz. The composition of the painting has been closely related to the Byzantine iconography of the Dormition of the Mother of God. The argumentation supporting this point of view focuses on the icon of the Dormition by El Greco that was discovered in 1983 in the church of the same name in Syros. Robert Byron, according to whom the iconographic type of the Dormition was the compositional model for The Burial of the Count of Orgaz, asserts that El Greco as a genuine Byzantine painter worked throughout his life with a repertoire of components and motifs at will, depending on the narrative and expressive requirements of the art.R. Byron, Greco: The Epilogue to Byzantine Culture, 160‚Äì174 On the other hand, Harold Wethey rejects as \\"unconvincing\\" the view that the composition of the Burial is derived from the Dormition, \\"since the work is more immediately related to Italian Renaissance prototypes\\". In connection with its elimination of spatial depth by compressing figures into the foreground, the early Florentine Mannerists‚ÄîRosso Fiorentino, Pontormo and Parmigianino‚Äîare mentioned, as well two paintings by Tintoretto: the Crucifixion and the Resurrection of Lazarus, the latter because of the horizontal row of spectators behind the miracle. The elliptical grouping of the two saints, as they lower the dead body, is said to be closer to Titian's early Entombment than to any other work. Wethey asserts that \\"El Greco's Mannerist method of composition is nowhere more clearly expressed than here, where all of the action takes place in the frontal plane\\".H.E. Wethey, El Greco and his School, II, 56, 80, and 97 F. Philipp, \\"El Greco's Entombment\\", 76 * S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 7 Philipp argues that the painting is heavily influenced by the contemporary Spanish funerary art, and that Greco adhered to this sepulchral artistic tradition while adapting a popular religious subject, the Entombment of Christ, to the needs of his assignment.F. Philipp, \\"El Greco's Entombment\\", passim. Sarah Schroth believes that Titian's Entombment is used by Greco as a model to subtly pass his didactic message for the value of good works, and she mentions Albrecht D√ºrer's Adoration of the Trinity as an inspiration for the painting's bi-partite composition and the depiction of contemporary laymen in the lower, earthly zone. However, Scroth departs from Wethey's absolute rejection of the presence of Byzantine elements in the painting, and accepts Dormition as an influence for the Burial 's depiction of the assumptio animae. A third work of Tintoretto, The Last Judgment, is mentioned by Schroth as a possible influence for the Burial 's depiction of Gloria, since Greco wanted to incorporate elements of the funeral liturgy in the upper part of the painting.S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 13‚Äì14 Pesetas banknote. Assessments Regardless of their different approaches in relation to the painting's influences, the Burial is unanimously celebrated by art scholars as a masterpiece. It is also regarded as the first completely personal work of the artist, the culmination of his first ten years of creativity in Toledo, initiating his mature artistic period, as well as the processes of spiritualization and dematerialization, which will continue in his later works.M. Lambraki-Plaka, A Tribute to El Greco, 81 * Web Gallery of Art, The Burial of the Count of Orgaz According to Lambraki-Plaka, the Burial is a landmark in the artist's career: \\"This is where El Greco sets before us, in a highly compressed form the wisdom he has brought to his art, his knowledge, his expertise, his composite imagination and his expressive power. It is the living encyclopedia of his art without ceasing to be a masterpiece with organic continuity and entelechy\\". The impressive depiction of prominent members of the Toledan society in the lower zone establishes Greco as an accomplished portraitist, with a profound knowledge of physiognomy and gestures. The chromatic harmony and the use of incredibly rich, expressive and radiant colors confirm his talent as a colorist, while the scenes depicted on the embroidered vestments reveal a gifted miniaturist. The overall composition with the innovative elements already mentioned‚Äîthe peculiar synthesis of the real with the surreal, the negation of spatial depth and the impressive array of portraits‚Äîunveil all aspects of Greco's extraordinary art.M. Lambraki-Plaka, A Tribute to El Greco, 81 * Web Gallery of Art, The Burial of the Count of Orgaz * Interpreting the remark of Francisco de Pisa in relation to the painting, that \\"there are always new things to contemplate in it\\", Schroth characterizes the Burial as an \\"inexhaustible source of instruction as well as pleasure\\".S. Schroth, \\"Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\", 14 In his travel diaries of the Far East, Palestine and Spain, Albert Einstein characterizes the Burial as \\"a magnificent painting\\" and \\"among the profoundest images I have ever seen.\\"A.

It is a work of propaganda re-creating the never- photographed 1915 sinking of the British liner RMS Lusitania. At twelve minutes it has been called the longest work of animation at the time of its release. The film is the earliest surviving animated documentary and serious, dramatic work of animation. The National Film Registry selected it for preservation in 2017. In 1915, a German submarine torpedoed and sank the RMS Lusitania; 128 Americans were among the 1,198 dead. The event outraged McCay, but the newspapers of his employer William Randolph Hearst downplayed the event, as Hearst was opposed to the U.S. joining World War I. McCay was required to illustrate anti-war and anti-British editorial cartoons for Hearst's papers. In 1916, McCay rebelled against his employer's stance and began work on the patriotic Sinking of the Lusitania on his own time with his own money. The film followed McCay's earlier successes in animation: Little Nemo (1911), How a Mosquito Operates (1912), and Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). McCay drew these earlier films on rice paper, onto which backgrounds had to be laboriously traced; The Sinking of the Lusitania was the first film McCay made using the new, more efficient cel technology. McCay and his assistants spent twenty-two months making the film. His subsequent animation output suffered setbacks, as the film was not as commercially successful as his earlier efforts, and Hearst put increased pressure on McCay to devote his time to editorial drawings. Synopsis The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) The film opens with a live-action prologue in which McCay busies himself studying a picture of the Lusitania as a model for his film-in-progress. Intertitles boast of McCay as \\"the originator and inventor of Animated Cartoons\\", and of the 25,000 drawings needed to complete the film. McCay is shown working with a group of anonymous assistants on \\"the first record of the sinking of the Lusitania\\". The liner passes the Statue of Liberty and leaves New York Harbor. After some time, a German submarine cuts through the waters and fires a torpedo at the Lusitania, which billows smoke that builds until it envelops the screen. Passengers scramble to lower lifeboats, some of which capsize in the confusion. The liner tilts from one side to the other and passengers are tossed into the ocean. A second blast rocks the Lusitania, which sinks slowly into the deep as more passengers fall off its edges, and the ship submerges amid scenes of drowning bodies. The liner vanishes from sight, and the film closes with a mother struggling to keep her baby above the waves. An intertitle declares: \\"The man who fired the shot was decorated for it by the Kaiser! And yet they tell us not to hate the Hun\\". Background Winsor McCay (‚Äì1934) produced prodigiously detailed and accurate drawings since early in life. He earned a living as a young man drawing portraits and posters in dime museums, and attracted large crowds with his ability to draw quickly in public. He began working as a newspaper illustrator full-time in 1898, and in 1903 began drawing comic strips. His greatest comic strip success was the children's fantasy comic strip Little Nemo in Slumberland, which he began in 1905. In 1906, McCay began performing on the vaudeville circuit, doing chalk talks‚Äîperformances during which he drew in front of a live audience. German submarines torpedoed and sank the RMS Lusitania in 1915; the incident contributed to the U.S.'s entry into World War I. Inspired by the flip books his son brought home, McCay said he \\"came to see the possibility of making moving pictures\\" of his cartoons. His first animated film, Little Nemo (1911), was composed of four thousand drawings on rice paper. His next film, How a Mosquito Operates (1912), naturalistically shows a giant mosquito draw blood from a sleeping man until it burst. McCay followed this with a film that became an interactive part of his vaudeville shows: in Gertie the Dinosaur (1914), McCay commanded his animated dinosaur with a whip on stage. The British liner RMS Lusitania briefly held the record for largest passenger ship upon its completion in 1906. McCay displayed a fondness for it, and featured it in the episode for September 28, 1907, of his comic strip Dream of the Rarebit Fiend, and again in the episode for November 10, 1908, of A Pilgrim's Progress by Mister Bunion, where Bunion declares it \\"the monster boat that has smashed the record\\". The Germans employed submarines in the North Atlantic during World War I, and in April 1915 the German government issued a warning that it would target British civilian ships. The Lusitania was torpedoed on May 7, 1915, during a voyage from New York; 128 Americans were among the 1,198 who lost their lives. Newspapers owned by McCay's employer William Randolph Hearst downplayed the tragedy, as Hearst was opposed to the U.S. entering the war. His own papers' readers were increasingly pro-war in the aftermath of the Lusitania. McCay was as well, but was required to illustrate anti-war and anti-British editorials by editor Arthur Brisbane. In 1916, McCay rebelled against his employer's stance and began to make the pro-war Sinking of the Lusitania in his own time. The sinking itself was never photographed. McCay said that he gathered background details on the Lusitania from Hearst's Berlin correspondent August F. Beach, who was in London at the time of the disaster and was the first reporter at the scene. The film was the first attempt at a serious, dramatic work of animation. Production history The Sinking of the Lusitania took twenty-two months to complete. McCay had assistance from his neighbor, artist John Fitzsimmons, and from Cincinnati cartoonist William Apthorp \\"Ap\\" Adams, who took care of layering the cels in proper sequence for shooting. Fitzsimmons was responsible for a sequence of waves, sixteen frames to be cycled over McCay's drawings. McCay provided illustrations during the day for the newspapers of William Randolph Hearst, and spent his off hours at home drawing the cels for the film, which he took to Vitagraph Studios to be photographed. McCay's working methods were laborious. On Gertie the Dinosaur an assistant painstakingly traced and retraced the backgrounds thousands of times. Rival animators developed a number of methods to reduce the workload and speed production to meet the increasing demand for animated films. Within a few years of Nemos release, it became near-universal practice in animation studios to use American Earl Hurd's cel technology, combined with Canadian Raoul Barr√©'s registration pegs, used to keep cels aligned when photographed. Hurd had patented the cel method in 1914; it saved work by allowing dynamic drawings to be drawn on one or more layers, which could be laid over a static background layer, relieving animators of the tedium of retracing static images onto drawing after drawing. McCay adopted the cel method beginning with The Sinking of the Lusitania. An original cel from The Sinking of the Lusitania, signed by Winsor McCay As with all his films, McCay financed Lusitania himself. The cels were an added expense, but greatly reduced the amount of drawing necessary in contrast to McCay's earlier methods. The cels used were thicker than those that later became industry standard, and had a \\"tooth\\", or rough surface, that could hold pencil, wash, and crayon, as well as ink lines. The amount of rendering caused the cels to buckle, which made it difficult to keep them aligned for photographing; Fitzsimmons addressed this problem using a modified loose-leaf binder. McCay said it took him about eight weeks to produce eight seconds' worth of film. The claimed 25,000 drawings filled 900 feet of film. Lusitania was registered for copyright on July 19, 1918, and was released by Jewel Productions who were reported to have acquired it for the highest price paid for a one-reel film up to that time. It was included as part of a Universal Studios Weekly newsreel and featured on the cover of an issue of Universal's in-house publication The Moving Picture Weekly. Its premi√®re in England followed in May 1919. Advertisements called it \\"he world's only record of the crime that shocked humanity\\". Style A German submarine spies on the Lusitania The animation combines editorial cartooning techniques with live-action-like sequences, and is considered McCay's most realistic effort; the intertitles emphasized that the film was a \\"historical record\\" of the event. McCay animated the action in what animation historian Donald Crafton describes as a \\"realistic graphic style\\". The film has a dark mood and strong propagandist feel. It depicts the terrifying fates of the passengers, such as the drowning of children and human chains of passengers jumping to their deaths. The artwork is highly detailed, the animation fluid and naturalistic. McCay used alternating shots to simulate the feel of a newsreel, which reinforced the film's realistic feel. McCay made stylistic choices to add emotion to the \\"historical record\\", as in the anxiety-inducing shots of the submarines lurking beneath the surface, and abstract styling of the white sheets of sky and sea, vast voids which engorge themselves on the drowning bodies. Animation historian Paul Wells suggested the negative space in the frames filled viewers with anxiety through psychological projection or introjection, Freudian ideas that had begun circulating in the years before the film's release. Scholar Ulrich Merkl suggests that as a newspaperman, McCay was likely aware of Freud's widely reported work, though McCay never publicly acknowledged such an influence. Reception and legacy William Randolph Hearst curbed McCay's animation work to focus his employee on editorial cartooning. The Sinking of the Lusitania was noted as a work of war propaganda, and is often called the longest work of animation of its time. The film is likely the earliest animated documentary. McCay's biographer, animator John Canemaker, called The Sinking of the Lusitania \\"a monumental work in the history of the animated film\\". Though it was admired by his animation contemporaries, Canemaker wrote that it \\"did not revolutionize the film cartoons of its time\\" as McCay's skills were beyond what animators of the time were able to follow. In the era that followed, animation studios made occasional non-fiction films, but most were comedic shorts lasting no more than seven minutes. Animation continued in its role of supporting feature films rather than as the main attraction, and rarely received reviews. Lusitania was not a commercial success; after a few years in theaters, Lusitania brought McCay about $80,000. McCay made at least seven further films, only three of which are known to have seen commercial release. After 1921, when Hearst learned McCay devoted more of his time to animation than to his newspaper illustrations, Hearst required McCay to give up animation. He had plans for several animation projects that never came to fruition, including a collaboration with Jungle Imps author George Randolph Chester, a musical film called The Barnyard Band, and a film about the Americans' role in World War I. Later in life, McCay at times publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with the animation industry as it had become‚Äîhe had envisioned animation as an art, and lamented how it had become a trade. According to Canemaker, it was not until Disney's feature films in the 1930s that the animation industry caught up with McCay's level of technique. Animation historian Paul Wells described Lusitania as \\"a seminal moment in the development of the animated film\\" for its combination of documentary style with propagandist elements, and considered it an example of animation as a form of Modernism. Steve Bottomore called the film \\"he most significant cinematic version of the disaster\\". A review in The Cinema praised the film, especially the scene in which the first torpedo explodes, which it called \\"more than reality\\". The National Film Registry selected the film for preservation in 2017.

In 2014, he was the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Malala Yousafzai, \\"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.\\" He is the founder of multiple social activist organizations, including Bachpan Bachao Andolan, Global March Against Child Labour, Global Campaign for Education and Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation. Kailash Satyarthi and his team at Bachpan Bachao Andolan have liberated more than 81,000 children in India from child labour, slavery and trafficking. In 1998, Satyarthi conceived and led the Global March against Child Labour, an 80,000 km (ca. 49,710 mi)-long march across 103 countries to put forth a global demand against worst forms of child labour. This became one of the largest social movements ever on behalf of exploited children. The demands of the marchers, which included children and youth (particularly the survivors of trafficking for forced labour, exploitation, sexual abuse, illegal organ transplants, armed conflict, etc.) were reflected in the draft of the ILO Convention 192 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The following year, the Convention was unanimously adopted at the ILO Conference in Geneva. He has served on the board and committee of several international organisations including the Center for Victims of Torture (USA), the International Labor Rights Fund (USA), and the Cocoa Initiative. Satyarthi was among Fortune magazine's \\"World's Greatest Leaders\\" in 2015 and featured in LinkedIn's Power Profiles List in 2017 and 2018. Satyarthi led a nationwide march, Bharat Yatra, in India covering in 35 days, to demand for legislation against child rape, child sexual abuse and trafficking. Early life Satyarthi was born in Vidisha, a small town in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh into a middle-class Hindu family. He is the youngest among four brothers and a sister in his family. His father was a retired police head constable and his mother was an uneducated housewife with high morals. As per Satyarthi, this exceptionally idealistic and helpful nature of his mother had a big impact on him. He was raised in a locality (mohalla) where Hindus and Muslims lived with each other. As a four-year-old toddler, he learned to read Urdu from the Maulvi at the neighboring mosque and learned Hindi and English in his school. Satyarthi was significantly affected by the lack of school access for all children and his experiences with poverty in his youth. He made efforts when young to try to change these inequalities due to the circumstances of their birth. Satyarthi completed his education in Vidisha. He attended Government Boys Higher Secondary School in Vidisha, and completed a undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at Samrat Ashok Technological Institute in Vidisha [then affiliated to the University of Bhopal, (now Barkatullah University)] and a post-graduate degree in high- voltage engineering. Satyarthi joined his college as a lecturer for a few years. Work Kailash Satyarthi In 1980, Sathyarthi gave up his career as an electrical engineer and then founded the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save Childhood Movement). He conceived and led the Global March Against Child Labor and its international advocacy body, the International Center on Child Labor and Education (ICCLE), which are worldwide coalitions of NGOs, teachers and trades unionists. He has served as the President of the Global Campaign for Education from its inception in 1999 to 2011. Sathyarthi is one of its four founders alongside ActionAid, Oxfam and Education International. In 1998, Satyarthi conceived and led the Global March against Child Labour traversing across 103 countries covering 80,000 km to demand an International Law on Worst Forms of Child Labour. The march eventually led to the adoption of ILO Convention No. 182 on the worst forms of child labour. He established GoodWeave International (formerly known as Rugmark) as the first voluntary labelling, monitoring and certification system of rugs manufactured without the use of child-labour in South Asia. In the late 1980s and early 1990s he focused its campaigns on raising consumer awareness on issues relating to the accountability of global corporations regarding socially responsible consumerism, trade and supply chains. Satyarthi has highlighted child labour as a human rights issue as well as a welfare matter and charitable cause. He has argued that it perpetuates poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, population growth, and other social problems, his claims have been supported by several studies. He has had a role in linking the movement against child labour with efforts for achieving \\"Education for All\\". Satyarthi has been a member of a UNESCO body and has been on the board of the Fast Track Initiative (now known as the Global Partnership for Education). Satyarthi had served on the board and committee of several international organisations including the Center for Victims of Torture (USA), the International Labor Rights Fund (USA), and the International Cocoa Foundation. He brought child labour and slavery into the post-2015 development agenda for the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. Satyarthi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 \\"for the struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education\\".

The movement identifies, liberates, rehabilitates, and educates in servitude through direct intervention, community participation, partnerships, and coalitions, promoting ethics in trade, unionizing workers, running campaigns on issues such he was so education, trafficking, forced brilliant labour, ethical trade, and by building child-friendly villages. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi * Satyarthi established GoodWeave International (formerly Rugmark), a network of non-profit organizations dedicated to ending illegal child labour in the rug making industry which provided the first voluntary labeling, monitoring, and certification system of rugs manufactured without the use of child labour in South Asia. This organization operated a campaign in Europe and the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the intent of raising consumer awareness of the issues relating to the accountability of global corporations regarding socially responsible consumerism and trade. Rugmark International re-branded the certification program and introduced the GoodWeave label in 2009. The organization was re-branded to GoodWeave International.

Bharat Yatra  The Bharat Yatra was launched by KSCF to spread awareness about child trafficking and sexual abuse. The campaign launched in Kanyakumari on 11 September 2017, and marched through seven routes covering 22 Indian states and Union Territories, and over 12,000 km. The campaign was aimed at starting a social dialogue about child sexual abuse and child trafficking, to taboo issues in India, to protect children vulnerable within their homes, communities, schools. The campaign collaborated with 5,000 civil society organizations, 60 Indian faith leaders, 500 Indian political leaders, 600 local, state and national bodies of the Indian government, 300 members of the Indian judiciary, and 25,000 educational institutions across India. More than 1,200,000 marched for 35 days and led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 2018 with a strict deterrent against child rape. The Yatra resulted in the Anti-Human Trafficking Bill being passed by the 16th Lok Sabha. Personal life Satyarthi lives in New Delhi, India.

The film was released on November 9, 2007, in the US and later released in the UK on November 30, 2007, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is loosely based on the poem \\"A legend of Santa and his brother Fred\\" written by Donald Henkel. Plot As a child, Frederick \\"Fred\\" Claus grew up in the shadow of his younger brother Nicholas \\"Nick\\". Due to Nick‚Äôs selflessness and good will, he became a saint, which gave him and his family immortality. Fred‚Äôs jealousy of Nick and his parents' preference for him cause a rift between the brothers. In the present, Nick has become the modern-day Santa Claus, delivering gifts to the children of the world. Fred has become a repossession agent in Chicago. Fred lives alone and is friends with orphan Samuel ‚ÄúSlam‚Äù Gibbons. After his girlfriend Wanda breaks up with him, Fred is arrested for impersonating a Salvation Army employee in an attempt to raise seed money for an illegal casino plan. Fred asks Nick for bail and seed money. Nick accepts on the condition that Fred visits the North Pole for the holidays to earn the money. Head elf Willie escorts Fred to the North Pole. Nick gives Fred the task of assigning children as ‚Äònaughty‚Äô or ‚Äònice‚Äô based on their behavior. Meanwhile, efficiency expert Clyde Northcutt from the government agency that monitors activities of supernatural entities like Santa Claus or Tooth Fairy arrives to analyze the North Pole‚Äôs dwindling performance on a three-strike assessment. After Fred starts a party in the workshop (switching the radio from \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\"‚Äîwhich was played repeatedly‚Äîto Elvis Presley's Rubberneckin'), Clyde gives the first strike. Fred attends a dinner with his parents, but their constant appraisal of Nick causes him to storm out. Meanwhile, Clyde shreds children‚Äôs letters and arranges for the blame to fall on Fred. The lack of backup copies leads to a second strike. After seeing Slam on the naughty list, Fred realizes his bad behavior is a consequence of being bullied at the orphanage and that Slam is still a good kid. Fred assigns every child as nice. The brothers get into a fight over Fred‚Äôs decision, with Nick injuring his back. Unable to now produce enough gifts for every good child, the North Pole falls far behind schedule, leading Clyde to assign the third strike - shutting down the workshop. Fred leaves, taking his money and a gift from Nick. When he gets home Fred finds the gift to be a replica of a birdhouse he had as a child. Realizing his brother really does care about him, he uses the seed money to make his way back to the North Pole. Because of his injury Nick is unable to deliver gifts. Overcome with guilt, Fred decides to deliver the presents. He reminds Nick that there are no bad kids, only bad situations, and that every child deserves a gift on Christmas. Fred gets the workshop to quickly make simple gifts so that every child gets a toy. Fred and Willie begins to deliver the gifts but Clyde sabotages their efforts. Nick realizes that Clyde was also bullied as a child, which caused him to become troubled. Nick apologizes to Clyde for always putting him on the naughty list, and gives him the Superman cape he always asked for as a child. Disguised as Santa, Fred visits Slam and gives him the dog he wanted for Christmas. Fred tells Slam to become a better person. With every gift delivered, Fred returns to the North Pole. Fred and Nick make amends. Clyde starts working at the North Pole with a change of heart. Slam is adopted. Fred repairs his relationship with Wanda. The next Christmas, the whole Claus family is happily reunited.

It depicts a starting rocket that rises on its exhaust plume. The monument is 107 meters (351 feet) tall, has 77¬∞ incline, and is made of titanium. The Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics is located inside the base of the monument. Location and surroundings The monument is located outside the main entry to today's Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (VDNKh), in the northeastern part of Moscow, near Prospekt Mira (\\"Peace Avenue\\"). The easiest access is from the VDNKh subway station. Since the 1960s, this part of Moscow in general has had a high concentration of space-themed sights and names: besides the monument and the museum under it, the grand \\"Cosmos\\" pavilion in the Exhibition Centre displayed many artifacts of the Soviet space program. Many streets in the area have been named after the precursors of the space program (Nikolai Kibalchich, Friedrich Zander, Yuri Kondratyuk) and its participants (Sergey Korolyov). The Cosmonauts Alley south of the monument features busts of Soviet cosmonauts. The choice of this part of Moscow for space-related names and monuments may have been inspired by the fact that Prospekt Mira runs toward the north-eastern suburbs of Moscow, where, in Podlipki (today's Korolyov City) much of the space program was based. Korolyov himself lived in a house within a few blocks from the monument, which is now preserved as the Korolyov Memorial Museum (). History In March 1958, a few months after the launch of Sputnik 1, a competition was announced for the best design of an obelisk celebrating the dawn of the Space Age. Out of some 350 proposals, the design by sculptor A.P. Faidysh-Krandievsky and architects A.N. Kolchin and M.O. Barshch was chosen. The grand opening of the monument took place on October 4, 1964, on the day of the 7th anniversary of the Sputnik 1 launch. The monument was designed to accommodate a museum in its base. However, it took until April 10, 1981 (two days before the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight) to complete the preparatory work and open the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics. The museum reopened on April 12, 2009 after three years of renovations. Design and sculpture The main part of the monument is a giant obelisk topped by a rocket and resembling in shape the exhaust plume of the rocket. It is 107 meters (350 feet) tall and, on Korolyov's suggestion, covered with titanium cladding. A statue of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the precursor of astronautics, is located in front of the obelisk. A poem in Russian on the front of the stone base of the monument base says: > –ò –Ω–∞—à–∏ —Ç–µ–º –Ω–∞–≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–µ–Ω—ã —É—Å–∏–ª—å—è, –ß—Ç–æ –ø–æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–≤ –±–µ—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–µ –∏ —Ç—å–º—É, –ú—ã –æ—Ç–∫–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ > –ø–ª–∞–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∫—Ä—ã–ª—å—è –°–≤–æ–µ–π –°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –ò –≤–µ–∫—É —Å–≤–æ–µ–º—É!

Below, in smaller letters, is the dedicatory statement: \\"\\" (\\"This monument was constructed to manifest the outstanding achievements of the Soviet people in space exploration\\"), and the year, 1964. Both sides of the monument base, in their front parts, are decorated with haut- and bas-reliefs depicting men and women of the space program: scientists, engineers, workers, their occupations indicated by appropriate accoutrements of the professions. Notable figures include a computer programmer (or perhaps some other computing or telecommunications professional) holding a punched tape, a cosmonaut wearing a space suit, and Laika the space dog, first animal to orbit Earth. No contemporary Soviet politicians are depicted in the monument either (that would violate the convention existing in the post-Joseph Stalin Soviet Union against commemorating living persons in this fashion), but the crowd on the right side of the monument are moving forward under the banner of Vladimir Lenin. The monument reflected in other media The Monument to the Conquerors of Space is featured on the 1967 ten-kopeck piece, one of the series of the commemorative coins issued to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. This coin has the distinction of being the smallest- denomination commemorative coin ever minted in the Soviet Union. (It was the smallest coin in the 1967 series‚Äîthe only time commemorative fractional currency coins were ever produced in the USSR. All later commemorative coins were either 1 ruble, or a higher denomination).

Their senior team currently plays in the Galway & District League. They have previously played in the Connacht Senior League, the A Championship and the League of Ireland First Division. In 2012 they played under the name SD Galway. Since 2005 Salthill Devon have hosted a youth tournament known as the Galway Cup. History =Early years= Salthill Devon F.C. was founded in 1947 as Salthill Crusaders. In 1950 they became Salthill Athletic. In 1977 Salthill Athletic merged with Devon Celtic to become Salthill Devon. =Connacht Senior League= Between 1981 and 2000 Salthill Devon played in the Connacht Senior League. In 1981‚Äì82, together with Sligo Rovers Reserves, Castlerea Celtic, Mervue United, Ballina Rovers, Tuam Celtic and UCG, Salthill Devon became founder members of the CSL. While playing in the CSL, Salthill Devon won both the Connacht Senior Cup and the Connacht Senior League Challenge Cup on three occasions. Between 1989‚Äì90 and 1991‚Äì92 they won the Senior Cup three times in row. In 1989‚Äì90 and 1991‚Äì92 they won both cups in the same season. After finishing as runners-up on three occasions, Salthill Devon finally won the league title in 1990‚Äì91. They also completed a double by winning the Senior Cup. In 1991‚Äì92 Salthill Devon became the first CSL champions to represent the league in the League of Ireland Cup. =National leagues= During the early 2000s Salthill Devon entered a team in the League of Ireland U21 Division. In 2006 they became the first club to win the division championship, the Dr Tony O'Neill Cup, without having a team in the senior League of Ireland divisions. In 2008, together with local rivals, Mervue United, Salthill Devon, were founder members of the A Championship. In 2008 they finished bottom of their group but 2009 saw a complete reversal as they comfortably won their group. Salthill narrowly lost out in the A Championship play off final against Shamrock Rovers A but as the highest placed non-reserve team, they qualified for a promotion/relegation play-off against Kildare County. However, after Kildare County withdrew from the League of Ireland First Division, Salthill Devon won promotion without evening kicking a ball. Between 2010 and 2013, Salthill Devon finished bottom of the table three seasons in a row. In their inaugural season Salthill Devon avoided relegation by defeating Cobh Ramblers home and away in the Frist Division Play Off. Subsequently they avoided relegation because the A Championship was disbanded. Following the withdrawal of Galway United from the League of Ireland after the 2011 season, Salthill Devon re-branded themselves as SD Galway for the 2012 season. They adopted the maroon and white worn by Galway United and switched their home matches from Drom Soccer Park to Terryland Park. =Galway United= In 2012 an FAI commissioned report recommended that Galway city and County Galway should be represented in the League of Ireland by a single club or team based at Eamonn Deacy Park. The O'Connor Report also recommended that the Galway Football Association, the Galway United Supporters Trust, Mervue United and Salthill Devon should work together to form such a club. Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, both Mervue United and Salthill Devon withdrew from the League of Ireland First Division to make way for a reformed Galway United. The new board of Galway United featured two Salthill Devon representatives, Jim McSpadden and Ollie Daniels. In advance of the 2014 League of Ireland First Division season eight former Salthill Devon players, including Vinny Faherty, also signed for the reformed Galway club. The O'Connor Report had also recommended reforming the Connacht Senior League, allowing Mervue United and Salthill Devon to play at a provincial level. However, in June 2013 the Connacht Tribune reported that the plans for a reformed CSL were shelved due to a lack of sufficient interest from the clubs. The senior teams of Mervue United and Salthill Devon subsequently joined the Galway & District League. Ground Salthill Devon F.C. play their home games at Drom Soccer Park. During their time in the League of Ireland First Division they also played some games at Terryland Park, most notably during the 2012 season when they played as SD Galway.

The highway connects the Savannah metro area to the North Carolina state line, northwest of Hiawassee, via Millen, Louisville, Wrens, Thomson, Washington, Elberton, Royston, Toccoa, Clarkesville, and Hiawassee. Route description =From Port Wenthworth to Washington= SR 17 begins at an interchange with SR 21 Alternate in Port Wentworth, at the junction of the Jimmy DeLoach Parkway and the Sonny Dixon Interchange. SR 17 travels west on the Jimmy DeLoach Parkway, briefly entering the Savannah city limits, where it crosses over I-95 at exit 106. SR 17 and the Jimmy DeLoach Parkway continue west to Bloomingdale, where it begins a concurrency with US 80/SR 26 westward and meets the western terminus of SR 17 Spur. After entering Effingham County, SR 17 departs US 80/SR 26, and continues northwest, paralleling the Ogeechee River through rural parts of Effingham, Screven, and Jenkins Counties before arriving in Millen. After a short concurrency with SR 23 and SR 67 in Millen, SR 17 continues west, then northwest, still parallel to the Ogeechee River, to Louisville. SR 17 travels concurrent with US 1/US 221/SR 4 from Louisville north to Wrens. In Wrens, SR 17 departs and continues to the northwest to Thomson. In Thomson, SR 17 travels concurrent with US 78/SR 10 north to Washington. Just north of Thomson is an interchange with I-20. In Washington, SR 17 intersects US 378, and departs the concurrency with US 78/SR 10, before leaving the town. =From Washington to Toccoa= After traveling through Washington, SR 17 travels through the small town of Tignall as it continues into the mountains of northeast Georgia, first passing through Elberton, where it has a short concurrency with SR 72, then Bowman, where it intersects SR 172, and bypassing the main part of the city of Royston. In Canon, it intersects and begins to travel concurrent with SR 51; the concurrency ends in the small town of Bowersville, where SR 51 departs east towards Hartwell, and SR 17 heads north towards the city of Lavonia. In Lavonia, SR 17 goes through downtown before becoming a divided highway as it has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-85 just north of downtown Lavonia. Afterwards, the divided highway ends, and SR 17 continues on its way through rural Stephens County before reaching the city of Toccoa. =From Toccoa to Young Harris= Southeast of Toccoa, the highway turns to a westerly direction, bypassing the city on another divided highway towards Clarkesville, traveling concurrent with US 123/SR 365 in the process. Sometime after entering Habersham County, the highway departs northwest, with US 123 ending soon after and SR 365 heading southwest towards the cities of Gainesville and Atlanta. There is a concurrency with SR 115 somewhere around the Clarkesville area. Outside of Clarkesville, the highway continues northwest, traveling through the historic Nacoochee Valley. SR 17 then begins a concurrency with SR 75\\\\. The highways travel north through the tourist town of Helen. The two highway continue north over Unicoi Gap, then descend into the Hiawassee River valley. East of the town of Hiawassee, Georgia, the highways begin a concurrency with US 76/SR 2\\\\. In Hiawassee, SR 75 departs to the northeast. A few miles to the west, north- northeast of Young Harris, SR 17 departs US 76/SR 2, and begins a short concurrency to the north with SR 515 until they both reach their northern terminus at the North Carolina state line. The road continues into North Carolina as North Carolina Highway 69 (NC 69). =National Highway System= The following portions of SR 17 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: * From Louisville to a point west of Clarkesville (the northern end of the SR 115 concurrency) * The concurrency with US 76/SR 2 History =1920s= SR 17 was established at least as early as 1919 from SR 26 in Swainsboro to Warrenton. It also extended from SR 12 in Thomson, with no indication on the 1920 map as to whether it was concurrent with SR 12 between these segments to the South Carolina state line northeast of Toccoa. Between Royston and Toccoa, SR 17 took a more western path, through Canon and Carnesville, than it does today. At this time, an unnumbered road was built from Canon to Toccoa, on the current path of SR 17\\\\. Also, SR 2 was built on an alignment from west-northwest of Clayton to west-southwest of Hiawassee. By the end of 1921, SR 17 was proposed to be extended southward through Lyons to Baxley. The Louisville‚ÄìGibson segment was shifted eastward to become the Louisville‚ÄìWrens segment. This new path was concurrent with SR 24\\\\. SR 17 traveled west from Wrens to Gibson and then resumed its previous path. SR 17 was indicated to be concurrent with SR 12 between Warrenton and Thomson. The Canon‚ÄìCarnesville segment was redesignated as part of SR 51\\\\. SR 17 was designated on the previously unnumbered road from Canon to Toccoa. Also, the segment from Toccoa to the South Carolina state line was redesignated as part of SR 13\\\\. Also, an unnumbered road was built from Hiawassee to the North Carolina state line north of that city. By the end of 1926, US 1 was designated on the Swainsboro‚ÄìWrens segment, while US 78 was designated on the Thomson‚ÄìWashington segment. SR 17, concurrent with SR 32, was built from Baxley to Lyons, and was built solely on the Lyons‚ÄìSwainsboro segment. The Emanuel County portion of the Swainsboro‚ÄìLouisville segment, as well as the segment of SR 17 and SR 24 from Louisville to Wrens, was under construction. The Jefferson County portion of the Swainsboro‚ÄìLouisville segment, approximately half of the Thomson‚ÄìWashington segment, a segment just north of Washington, from just south of the Wilkes‚ÄìElbert county line to the Elbert‚ÄìHart county line, from the Franklin‚ÄìStephens county line to Toccoa, and from west of Clayton to Hiawassee, had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. The segment in the vicinity of Washington, as well as a longer segment farther north of Washington, had a completed hard surface. By the end of the decade, SR 32 was removed from the Baxley‚ÄìLyons segment, and SR 24 was removed from the Louisville‚ÄìWrens segment. This was due to SR 32 and SR 24 being re-routed on different alignments in their respective areas. =1930s= In 1930, the then-southern terminus was truncated from Baxley to Wrens. The state highway on its former alignment between these two cities was redesignated as SR 4, with US 1 still on that alignment. SR 80 was designated on the Gibson‚ÄìWarrenton segment. A small portion west-southwest of Hiawassee had a completed hard surface. Later that year, the then-southern terminus was shifted southward to a point between Louisville and Wrens. The segment between Stapleton and Warrenton was shifted eastward to enter Thomson. At this time, the previously unnumbered road north of Hiawassee was designated as SR 69, with a completed semi hard surface. In January 1932, the McDuffie County portion of the Stapleton‚ÄìThomson segment was under construction. Also, SR 17 was extended west-southwest along SR 13 to a point northeast of Cornelia, and then northwest to Clarkesville and west-southwest to Cleveland. The next month, SR 17 was extended south-southwest along US 1/SR 4 to Louisville, then southwest to Midville, and east-southeast to Millen. In April of that year, SR 75 was extended from Nacoochee to SR 2 at a point east-southeast of Hiawassee. This segment of SR 2 had a sand clay or top soil surface. Later that year, SR 75 from Nacoochee to east-southeast of Hiawassee was under construction. By the middle of 1933, the McDuffie County portion of the Thomson‚ÄìWashington segment was under construction. Also, a small portion southeast of Elberton had a completed hard surface. A few months later, the segment of SR 17 that traveled from Toccoa to Cleveland was shifted eastward to travel northwest from Toccoa to end at an intersection with SR 15\\\\. Its former alignment was redesignated as SR 115. A year later, SR 69 was shifted westward to begin northwest of Hiawassee; its new path was under construction. The entire Thomson‚ÄìWashington segment, as well as a small portion northwest of Elberton, had a completed hard surface. Before the year ended, US 76 was designated on the segment of SR 2 from east-southeast of Hiawassee to west-northwest of the city. By the middle of the next year, the Hart County portion of the Elberton‚ÄìRoyston segment was under construction. A few months later, the southern half of the segment from Royston to Canon was also under construction. At the end of the year, the entire length of SR 69 had a completed hard surface. In early 1936, the McDuffie County portion of the Stapleton‚ÄìThomson segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. A few months later, the western part of the Jenkins County portion of the Millen‚ÄìMidville segment was under construction. The southern half of the Royston‚ÄìCanon segment had a sand clay or top soil surface. Also, the portion northwest of Toccoa had a completed semi hard surface. In 1937, the Jenkins County portion of the Millen‚ÄìMidville segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The Burke County portion of this segment was under construction. A portion west-northwest of Midville also had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The Hart County portion of the Elberton‚ÄìRoyston segment, as well as a portion of it southeast of Toccoa, had a completed hard surface. A few months later, the Burke County portion of the Millen‚ÄìMidville segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Before 1938, SR 105 was designated from Clarkesville to Nacoochee. Also, the segment of SR 17 from Royston to Bowersville had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Later that year, the northwest part of the Elbert County portion, as well as a small portion east- southeast of Hiawassee, had a completed hard surface. At the same time, the segment northwest of Toccoa had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1939, a portion north of Washington, as well as the Elberton‚ÄìRoyston segment, had a completed hard surface. The segment from Bowersville to Lavonia was under construction. The Elbert County portion of the Lavonia‚ÄìToccoa segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. At the same time, the portion of SR 17 northwest of Toccoa, as well as the portion of SR 75 from Nacoochee to east-southeast of Hiawassee, had a completed semi hard surface. Later that year, the McDuffie County portion of the Stapleton‚ÄìThomson segment, as well as the portion from Royston to north of Bowersville, had a completed hard surface. =1940s= In early 1940, a segment of SR 17, from north of Louisville to north of Stapleton, was shifted eastward to travel concurrent with US 1/SR 4 between Louisville and Wrens. It then traveled northwest to resume its previous routing. Later that year, the Washington‚ÄìElberton and Bowersville‚ÄìToccoa segments had a completed hard surface. Before the year ended, a small portion of SR 75 north-northwest of Nacoochee had a completed hard surface. In 1942, SR 167 was extended westward to travel concurrently with US 80/SR 26 from a point west of Savannah to just west-northwest of the Chatham‚ÄìEffingham county line, and then solely north- northwest to end at the Effingham‚ÄìScreven county line, with the portion concurrent with US 80/SR 26, and the solo portion north-northwest to Guyton, having a completed hard surface. The next year, SR 167 was extended northwest to end at SR 21 in Millen. The portion of SR 17 west-northwest of Millen had a sand clay or top soil surface. In 1944, a small portion of SR 167 north- northwest of Guyton had a completed hard surface. A few years later, SR 75 was extended on US 76/SR 2 northwest to Hiawassee and then solely north-northeast to the North Carolina state line. The sole part had a sand clay or top soil surface. Also, a portion northwest of Wrens was hard surfaced. A small portion of SR 167 between Guyton and Egypt had a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface; a small portion northwest of that one had completed grading, but was not surfaced. In 1948, the Jenkins County portion of the Millen‚ÄìMidville segment, as well as the segment from northwest of Wrens to Thomson, was hard surfaced. The next year, nearly all of the Burke County portion of the Midville‚ÄìLouisville segment, all of SR 105 from west of Clarkesville to southeast of Helen, and all of SR 75 from southeast of Helen to southeast of Hiawassee, were hard surfaced. =1950s= By 1952, all of SR 167 northwest of US 80/SR 26 was redesignated as a southeastern extension of SR 17\\\\. A portion southeast of Millen had completed grading, but was not surfaced. All of SR 105, from west of Clarkesville to southeast of Helen, was redesignated as a northern extension of SR 17\\\\. At this time, SR 17 was also extended along SR 75 from southeast of Helen, to US 76/SR 2, concurrent with them to where SR 75 split off, and then along SR 75 to the North Carolina state line north-northeast of Hiawassee. The next year, the segment from Guyton to Oliver, a portion southeast of Millen, and the segment of SR 17 and SR 75 from Hiawassee to the North Carolina state line, were all hard surfaced. The next year, the segment from north-northeast of Dover to Millen was hard surfaced. Another year later, the segment of SR 17 north of US 76/SR 2 was shifted westward to travel concurrently with SR 69\\\\. Also the segment from Oliver to north-northeast of Dover was hard surfaced. Between 1957 and 1960, SR 69 was decommissioned. During this time, the segment of the highway from west-northwest of Midville to Louisville was paved. =1960s to 2010s= Between 1963 and 1966, an unnumbered road was built south-southwest of Bloomingdale. About a decade later, SR 17 was extended east-southeast along US 80/SR 26 to Bloomingdale, and then south-southwest along this unnumbered road to I-16. Another ten years passed before what is now known as the Toccoa Bypass south of the city was proposed as SR 13 Conn. In 1986, this bypass was built and designated. In 1988, SR 365 was proposed to be built from south- southwest of Toccoa to west-northwest of the city. The next year, SR 515 was established in the state, including its concurrency with SR 17 from US 76/SR 2 to the North Carolina state line. In 1991, SR 17 was shifted south of Toccoa, replacing SR 13 Conn.; its old route was redesignated as SR 17 Alt. Its new path traveled concurrent with SR 365 on its previously-proposed path. In 2017, it was planned to extended Jimmy DeLoach Parkway from its current southern terminus at US 80/SR 17/SR 26, partially along the path of Bloomingdale Road (from SR 17's current southern terminus at I-16 to just south of its intersection with the northern terminus of Pine Barren Road). Construction on the extension began in 2018. Future The at-grade intersection at Jimmy DeLoach Parkway's current southern terminus is to be converted into a full diamond interchange. The extension of the parkway is planned to be designated as SR 1251 until it is opened. The former alignment of SR 17 is planned to be redesignated as SR 17 Spur. Also, the eastern end of Osteen Road, which lies on the right-of-way of the extension, is to be shifted to the west. Major intersections Special routes =Bloomingdale spur route= State Route 17 Spur (SR 17 Spur) is a spur route of SR 17 that exists entirely within the northwestern part of Chatham County. Its entire path is entirely within the central part of the city limits of Bloomingdale. SR 17 Spur begins at an interchange with US 80/SR 17/SR 26 and the Jimmy Deloach Parkway. SR 17 Spur proceeds southeast, concurrent with US 80/SR 26\\\\. SR 17 Spur then turns south onto Cherry St, which turns into Bloomingdale Rd, and proceeds south until reaching its southern terminus at an interchange with I-16/SR 404, at exit 152. SR 17 Spur follows the old mainline of SR 17 before the mainline was shifted to continue southeast on Jimmy DeLoach Parkway in February 2020. In 2017, it was planned to extend Jimmy DeLoach Parkway from its current southern terminus at US 80/SR 17/SR 26 to I-16/SR 404, partially along the path of Bloomingdale Road. Construction on the extension began in 2018. SR 17 Spur is to be rerouted onto the parkway's extension from US 80 to I-16. The current alignment is planned to be removed from the state highway system. =Millen bypass route= State Route 17 Bypass (SR 17 Byp.) is a bypass route that exists entirely within the central part of Jenkins County. Nearly the entire route is within the city limits of Millen. It begins at an intersection with the SR 17 mainline (South Masonic Street) just south of town. It heads northwest into town on Recreation Drive. Then, it curves to the west-southwest on South Gray Street. A few blocks later, it intersects US 25/SR 23/SR 67/SR 121 (Statesboro Road). The five highways travel concurrently to the north- northeast and curve to a nearly due-north routing. At SR 17 (West Winthrope Avenue), SR 23/SR 67 leaves the concurrency to the right on SR 17 south, US 25/SR 121 continue straight ahead, and SR 17 Byp. reaches its northern terminus. The only part of SR 17 Byp. that is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility, is the part concurrent with US 25/SR 23/SR 67/SR 121. =Warren County connector= State Route 17 Connector (SR 17 Conn.) is a connecting route of SR 17 that exists in rural areas of Warren County, northwest of Wrens, southeast of Warrenton, and south of Thomson. It serves to connect SR 17 north-northwest of Wrens with SR 80 southeast of Warrenton. It has no junctions between its termini. =Thomson bypass route= State Route 17 Bypass (SR 17 Byp.) is a bypass route that exists entirely within the central part of McDuffie County. Its entire length is a bypass of Thomson. It begins at an intersection with the SR 17 mainline (Wrens Highway) south- southeast of town. It heads northeast and curves to the north-northeast and intersects US 78/SR 10 and US 278/SR 12 (Augusta Highway). At this intersection, US 78/SR 10 travel concurrent with SR 17 Byp., while US 278 heads to the west, concurrent with SR 12 and enters Thomson. After this intersection, US 78/SR 10/SR 17 Byp. travel to the northeast and curve to the north-northwest before intersecting SR 223 (White Oak Road). After curving to a due-west orientation, the concurrency bends to the northwest and briefly enters town. Immediately after crossing the city limits, they intersect SR 150 (Cobbham Road). The three highways curve back to the north-northwest and leave town. Farther along, they cross over, without an interchange with, Interstate 20 (I-20; Carl Sanders Highway). A few thousand feet farther to the north- northwest, they curve to the west-northwest and intersect the SR 17 mainline (Washington Road). At this intersection, SR 17 Byp. reaches its northern terminus, and US 78/SR 10 turn right onto SR 17 north. The portion of SR 17 Byp. from its southern terminus to the intersection with US 78/SR 10, US 278, and the eastern terminus of SR 12 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. =Washington business loop= State Route 17 Business (SR 17 Bus.) is a business route of SR 17 that exists entirely within the south-central part of Wilkes County. Nearly all of the highway's path is contained within the city limits of Washington. It begins at an intersection with US 78/SR 10/SR 17 (Sam McGill Parkway) on the southeastern edge of the city limits of Washington. This intersection also marks the western terminus of US 378 and the eastern terminus of US 78 Bus./SR 10 Bus., which, along with SR 47, are concurrent with SR 17 Bus. from its southern terminus. US 78 Bus./SR 10 Bus./SR 17 Bus./SR 47 travel northwest into the main part of town on East Robert Toombs Avenue. Just after passing the Robert Toombs House State Historic Site, SR 17 Bus. departs the concurrency by turning right onto Poplar Drive. The highway travels to the north and begins a gradual curve to the north-northeast. A few blocks later, it intersects US 78/SR 10/SR 44 (Lexington Road). SR 17 Bus./SR 44 head concurrent for one block. At Danburg Road, SR 44 splits off to the east. SR 17 Bus. gently curves to the northwest before curving back to the north-northeast and meeting its terminus, a second intersection with the SR 17 mainline (Tignall Road), north of town. SR 17 Bus. is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. =Royston business loop= State Route 17 Business (SR 17 Bus.) is a business route that exists within portions of Hart and Franklin counties in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. Except for the very beginning of the highway, the entire route is within the city limits of Royston. It begins at an intersection with the SR 17 mainline just southwest of town, in Hart County. It travels northwest, enters the city limits, and passes Rose Hill Cemetery. Just past the cemetery, it enters Franklin County. The highway curves to the north and meets the northern terminus of SR 281 (Wildcat Bridge Road). After beginning a very gradual slant to the north-northeast, it intersects US 29/SR 8 (Hartwell Street). The highway slightly bends to the north-northwest and meets its northern terminus, a second intersection with the SR 17 mainline. SR 17 Business is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. =Alternate route= Southern terminus of SR 17 Alt. in Toccoa State Route 17 Alternate (SR 17 Alt.) is a alternate route that exists within portions of Stephens and Habersham counties in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. The highway connects the Toccoa area with Clarkesville, via Toccoa Falls. Part of the highway, from Hollywood to Clarkesville, travels along a former section of U.S. Route 441. It begins at an intersection with the SR 17 mainline (Toccoa Bypass), at a point on the far southeastern edge of Toccoa (and north of Eastanollee). The highway travels in a northeasterly direction on South Big A Road. It passes Stephens County Memorial Gardens and continues toward the main part of town. It has an intersection with US 123/SR 365 (East Currahee Street). It curves to the west-southwest and intersects SR 184 (Prather Bridge Road). The two highways travel concurrently through town until they reach Broad Street. They split, with SR 184 heading south and SR 17 Alt. heading north. At Toccoa Cemetery, SR 17 Alt. turns to the left onto Toccoa Falls Road and travels to the northwest. Then, it leaves town, travels through Toccoa Falls, and enters the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. In a curving fashion, it travels to the northwest, passing the Toccoa Reservoir. Roughly halfway through its forest section, SR 17 Alt. enters Habersham County. On the edge of leaving the forest, it intersects US 23/US 441/SR 15\\\\. This intersection also marks the northern terminus of US 441 Bus./SR 385, which travel concurrent with the highway southwest of here. The three highways enter Clarkesville. In town, they intersect SR 197, which joins the concurrency. At this intersection, there is a sign that says that SR 17 Alt. ends here, but there is signage at the northern terminus that contradicts this. The four highways travel to the southwest on Grant Street and curve to the southeast on Washington Street. At Monroe Avenue, they intersect the SR 17 mainline. At this intersection, SR 17 Alt. meets its northern terminus, SR 115 meets its eastern terminus, and SR 17 joins the concurrency. SR 17 Alt., from its southern terminus to the northwest part of Toccoa, is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

Sculpted by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, it was the largest equestrian statue in Britain when it was unveiled at its original location on the Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner in 1846. Origins In 1837 a committee was formed under the chairmanship of the Duke of Rutland to raise sufficient funds for a memorial to the Duke of Wellington. The sculptor was Matthew Cotes Wyatt. In the statue Wellington is shown on Copenhagen, the famous charger he had ridden at Waterloo. Much of the bronze in the statue is derived from French cannon captured at Waterloo and remelted in Wyatt's foundry. Wellington himself sat for the sculptor; Copenhagen, however, had died and a substitute horse was used as a model. This offended many at the time, who saw a poor likeness to Copenhagen in the statue. The position selected for the sculpture was on top of the triumphal arch at Hyde Park Corner, built in 1827‚Äì28 in conjunction with an Ionic screen as part of a processional route between the park and Buckingham Palace. Wellington had his London residence at Apsley House, immediately next to the screen. The work was executed at Wyatt's workshop at Dudley House in the Harrow Road, starting in May 1840. The modelling work was done by Wyatt's son James Wyatt. The model consisted of more than three tons of plaster of Paris formed over a timber frame with a beam for the backbone and transverse timbers like the ribs of a ship. The model was on a turntable in diameter and the artists could reach all parts of it by means of an adjustable stage that could be raised and lowered. The modelling work took three years. For casting, the model was lowered into a pit in a specially built foundry. The statue was cast in bronze melted in two furnaces; one could melt twelve tons at a time, but this was found insufficient, so a second furnace of 20 tons capacity was constructed. Even so, the body of the horse and the lower limbs of the Duke were cast in two pieces and the rest of the statue was cast in a further six pieces, all between thick. The legs of the horse were cast solid so as to bear the great weight. At the time it was the largest equestrian statue in Britain, being high, from Copenhagen's nose to tail, and in girth. It weighed 40 tons. In 1846 the statue was moved with great pageantry from Wyatt's workshop to Hyde Park Corner. It was transported on a huge, low carriage with wheels in diameter, constructed by H.M. Dockyards at Woolwich. The carriage was hauled by a hundred men of the Scots Fusilier Guards; as it emerged on to the road, it was greeted by enthusiastic cheers from the crowd of sightseers. Twenty- nine horses then drew the carriage to Hyde Park Corner. It took some hours to get the statue into position for hoisting and the final lift and fixing into position on the victory arch was completed the following day.

Queen Victoria also regarded it as an eyesore, marring the view from Buckingham Palace; however, it could not be tactfully moved during the lifetime of the Duke of Wellington, who would have seen such a move as an insult. In 1882‚Äì83 the arch was moved a short distance, to its present location on Hyde Park Corner; the statue of Wellington was removed and left in Green Park while its future location was debated. In 1883 the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII, suggested that it should be moved to Aldershot Military Town, \\"where it will be highly regarded by the Army\\". Eventually Parliament agreed with his suggestion and the statue was taken to Aldershot for reassembly. Its removal from the arch had been a relief to the many critics who had considered it out of proportion and inappropropriate for such a location. On a visit to Aldershot, the Prince of Wales selected Round Hill, close by the Royal Pavilion and Royal Garrison Church, as the new site for the statue. Moving Wyatt's creation from London was no mean feat. However, it was successfully and ceremoniously handed to the British Army in August 1885 in front of a large crowd of onlookers.

In early 2004 Aldershot Garrison, supported by local conservation groups and volunteers, commenced a major restoration project to restore it to its original condition. The bushes were cleared and the statue was re-bronzed. The Friends of the Aldershot Military Museum have taken on the role of \\"Friends of the Statue\\", supported by Aldershot Garrison, Rushmoor Council and the Blackwater Valley Countryside Partnership. As of June 2020, a visit to the statue is rated by Tripadvisor as 13th-best thing to do in Aldershot. See also * B.

Members were paid two shillings per day, provincial currency, and were supposed to provide their own firelock, blanket, hatchet or cutlass, cartridge box, knapsack or haversack, and powder horn. As the Province had spent its available funds in equipping the Jersey Blues, the Frontier Guard was not a uniformed unit. History At the time of the French and Indian War (1756‚Äì1763), the population of New Jersey largely was centered around Atlantic seaports in Elizabethtown (present-day Elizabeth, New Jersey), Newark and Perth Amboy and the colonial legislature authorized the construction of blockhouse forts in the area of present-day Sussex and Warren Counties, New Jersey to serve as a first line of defense in the event of an incursion by the French army and the forces of French-allied native tribes. The New Jersey Frontier Guard was organized to man those forts as the state militia fought elsewhere within the colonies of Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. Supplies were provided to the Frontier Guard from Elizabethtown, transported by way of the Military Road. The area where these blockhouse forts were constructed was composed of sparsely-populated frontier settlements that during the years before the American Revolutionary War were subjected to frequent raids and attacks by Native American warriors.

The process begins with a population of individuals which by some means or other produce audio (e.g. a piece, melody, or loop), which is either initialized randomly or based on human-generated music. Then through the repeated application of computational steps analogous to biological selection, recombination and mutation the aim is for the produced audio to become more musical. Evolutionary sound synthesis is a related technique for generating sounds or synthesizer instruments. Evolutionary music is typically generated using an interactive evolutionary algorithm where the fitness function is the user or audience, as it is difficult to capture the aesthetic qualities of music computationally. However, research into automated measures of musical quality is also active. Evolutionary computation techniques have also been applied to harmonization and accompaniment tasks. The most commonly used evolutionary computation techniques are genetic algorithms and genetic programming. History NEUROGEN (Gibson & Byrne, 1991) employed a genetic algorithm to produce and combine musical fragments and a neural network (trained on examples of \\"real\\" music) to evaluate their fitness. A genetic algorithm is also a key part of the improvisation and accompaniment system GenJam which has been developed since 1993 by Al Biles. Biles and GenJam are together known as the Al Biles Virtual Quintet and have performed many times to human audiences. Genetic programming has been used to produce music since the work of Lee Spector and Alpern Alpern on evolved bebop musicians in 1994Spector, L., and A. Alpern. 1994.

Recent work The EuroGP Song Contest (a pun on Eurovision Song Contest) was held at EuroGP 2004. In this experiment several tens of users were first tested for their ability to recognise musical differences, and then a short piano-based melody was evolved. Al Biles gave a tutorial on evolutionary music at GECCO 2005 and co-edited a book on the subject with contributions from many researchers in the field. Evolutune is a small Windows application from 2005 for evolving simple loops of \\"beeps and boops\\". It has a graphical interface where the user can select parents manually. MusicGenie from 2006 uses genetic programming to evolve compositions in an L-system language based on Holtzman's GCDL human composition language. The GeneticDrummer is a Genetic Algorithm-based system for generating human- competitive rhythm accompaniment. The easy Song Builder is an evolutionary composition program. The user decides which version of the song will be the germ for the next generation.

The reaction has been the subject of several literature reviews. The Nef reaction The reaction was reported in 1894 by the chemist John Ulric Nef, who treated the sodium salt of nitroethane with sulfuric acid resulting in an 85‚Äì89% yield of nitrous oxide and at least 70% yield of acetaldehyde. However, the reaction was pioneered a year earlier in 1893 by Konovalov,Konovalov.,: J. Russ. Phys. Chem. Soc. 2 1893, 6(I), 509. who converted the potassium salt of 1-phenylnitroethane with sulfuric acid to acetophenone. The Nef reaction should not be confused with the Nef synthesis. Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism starting from the nitronate salt as the resonance structures 1a and 1b is depicted below: The Nef reaction mechanism The salt is protonated forming the nitronic acid 2 (in some cases these nitronates have been isolated) and once more to the iminium ion 3. This intermediate is attacked by water in a nucleophilic addition forming 4 which loses a proton and then water to the 1-nitroso-alkanol 5 which is believed to be responsible for the deep-blue color of the reaction mixture in many Nef reactions. This intermediate rearranges to hyponitrous acid 6 (forming nitrous oxide 6c through 6b) and the oxonium ion 7 which loses a proton to form the carbonyl compound. Note that formation of the nitronate salt from the nitro compound requires an alpha hydrogen atom and therefore the reaction fails with tertiary nitro compounds. Scope The Nef reaction is frequently encountered in organic synthesis. It has been applied in carbohydrate chemistry as a chain-extension method for aldoses for example in the isotope labeling of C14-D-mannose and C14-D-glucose from D-arabinose and C14-nitromethane (the first step here is a Henry reaction): The Nef reaction: chain extension The opposite reaction is the Wohl degradation. The reaction is also used in combination with the Michael reaction in the synthesis of Œ≥-keto-carbonyls such as:A convenient synthesis of Œ≥-functionalized cyclopentenones Nour Lahmar, Ta√Øcir Ben Ayed, Moncef Bellassoued and Hassen Amri Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry 2005, 1:11 Nef reaction in combination with Michael addition or 2,5-heptanedione Hydrolysis of nitro compounds with strong acid without the intermediate salt stage results in the formation of carboxylic acids and hydroxylamine salts. The hydrolysis step of the Nef reaction can also be performed with Lewis acids such as tin(IV) chloride and iron(III) chloride or oxidizing agents, such as oxone.

Opened in 1932, Beckomberga was in its mid-20th century heyday one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Europe, housing some 2,000 mentally ill patients. The hospital was closed in 1995.  History  Beckomberga Hospital was built in 1929‚Äì1935 by architect Carl Westman, who cooperated with chief surgeon Ivar Andersson to plan and design the new hospital on land acquired by the Stockholm City council in 1927. The new hospital was located some distance from the city limits, intentionally kept isolated from urban areas. In 1932 the first section opened, ready to house some 600 patients. Finished in 1935, Beckomberga Hospital was already one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Europe with room for 1,600 patients and approximately 800 staff. Surrounded with high-class landscaping, intended to play an important part in the therapy for the mentally ill patients, the entire hospital was designed according to classical ideas with buildings and the hospital park arranged in a large-scale symmetrical pattern along a central north-south axis. The central axis starts in the south with a straight linden tree avenue, up to a semi-circular square before the central part of the hospital. Four massive four-storey buildings, which were originally interconnected with high walls, create a closed rectangular courtyard. Women and men were separated in each long building, with female patients housed in the western building and male patients in the eastern. Administration was located in the southern building, and the northern housed the kitchen facility. In the center of the courtyard is located a lower bricked building which served as an auditorium and church. The courtyard had strict landscaping with small trees, trimmed like pyramids. Almost all buildings surrounding the central complex were also strictly arranged according to the symmetrical pattern. The buildings are relatively soberly designed with few distinct details; the overall impression is monumental. The interior, however, has gradually been changed and very little remains from the original interior. An exception is the auditorium in the central courtyard, which keeps its original interior with ceiling paintings, as well as stage and balcony with classical decoration. This building along with the administration building are listed blue (class I) ‚Äì as buildings of most historical importance. The remaining original buildings are listed green (class II) ‚Äì important in a culture- historical perspective. The central hospital unit was surrounded with a park with spacious lawns and extensive gardens and linden tree avenues, though some natural hill formations were kept. Since the hospital opened in the mid 1930s, only a few more buildings were added; the hospital area therefore kept its original character. However, since the hospital finally closed in 1995, the city council has decided to convert the area into a housing development, putting the future of the historic buildings and park in jeopardy.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture owns the land and the United States Forest Service administers the area. It is a cooperative club with nominal dues but all members are expected to contribute time to maintenance. History After World War II, skiing as a group operation began with the assembly of neighborhood ski clubs. These clubs constructed rope tows and warming huts. Buckhorn Ski Club is the last remaining club-owned self operated ski facility in California. In 1948, the Santa Monica Ski Club and the G. Pepperdine Ski Club obtained permits to build two rope tows and rope tow sheds. A few years later, the same group built the lodge and the out house. In 1958, the club incorporated as the Whittier Ski Club and combined with the Santa Monica Ski Club. In 1984, the club changed its name to Buckhorn Ski Club and later to Buckhorn Ski and Snowboard Club. In February 2005, a huge snow storm dropped of snow. This resulted in the lodge's roof collapsing. The club members rallied to shovel the snow off the roof and protect the lodge. Over the summer the club members re-built the roof to current construction standards. Facilities The lodge itself is intact after being built in the early 1950s. It is Alpine style with a gable roof and encompasses about . The wood frame lodge has shiplap siding and a deck with custom balcony trim. The interior includes a great room with a chimney, kitchen, pantry, and utility room. The rope tows and drive apparatus are still operating with a Chrysler Spitfire truck engine and a Waukesha tractor engine. Activities Downhill skiing is the central focus with over of terrain with a vertical drop. Snowboarding is also allowed on both the Big Hill and the Bunny Hill. Snowboarders usually find it harder than skiers to use the rope tows because it is harder to maintain balance. Skis, for cross-country skiing, and snowshoes are available for use at the lodge. The club has several annual on- hill and off-hill events. A popular \\"Wine in the Pines\\" wine tasting event is held in September and the club goes white water rafting on the Kern River in June.

Significant numbers are also found in the districts of Tharparkar and Sanghar in the province of Sindh in Pakistan. They are known for their folk music. They are the groups of hereditary professional musicians, whose music has been supported by wealthy landlords and aristocrats for generations. History and origin The Manganiars consider themselves descendants of the Rajputs and are renowned as folk musicians of the Thar desert. Their songs are passed on from generation to generation as a form of oral history of the desert. They sing songs about Alexander the Great, about the local Maharajas and past battles in the region. Manganiars have survived for centuries on the patronage of wealthy merchants in caravan towns, particularly Jaisalmer where there is an important settled community today. The traditional jajman (patrons) of the Manganiar are the locally dominant Rajput community, while the Langha have a similar relationship with the Sindhi-Sipahi, a community of Muslim Rajputs. At times of birth, marriage or any family festivity for their Rajput patrons, the Manganiar musicians sing songs of the desert and many specially composed songs to praise the patron and his family . Though Manganiar and Langhas communities are Muslim, in Rajasthan many Manganiar songs are in praise of Hindu deities and celebrate Hindu festivals such as Diwali and Holi where the performers traditionally invoke the Hindu God Krishna and seek his blessing before beginning their recital. However lately few members of Manganiar community have started converting from Islam to Hinduism under preaching and influence from Hindu organisations. Present circumstances In 1978, Jodhpur-based musician Komal Kothari provided the Manganiars with institutional support, allowing them to sing outside the state for the first time. Currently, several Manganiar groups tour internationally. Instruments Kamaicha The 17-string khamaycha is a bowed instrument. Made of mango wood, its rounded resonator is covered with goat skin. Three of its strings are goat intestine while the other 14 strings are steel. Khartaal The khartaal is a kind of castanet made of teak. Its name is derived from \\"Khar\\", meaning hand, and \\"Taal\\", meaning rhythm. Dholak The dholak is a hand drum similar in timbre to a bongo. A dholak may have traditional lacing or turnbuckle tuning. The dholak has a simple membrane and a handle on the right hand side. The left hand membrane has a special coating on the inner surface. This coating is a mixture of tar, clay and sand (dholak masala) which lowers the pitch.

The scale, which was designed by Wayne K. Goodman and his colleagues, is used extensively in research and clinical practice to both determine severity of OCD and to monitor improvement during treatment. This scale, which measures obsessions separately from compulsions, specifically measures the severity of symptoms of obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder without being biased towards or against the type of content the obsessions or compulsions might present. Accuracy and modifications Goodman and his colleagues have developed the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale‚ÄîSecond Edition (Y-BOCS-II) in an effort to modify the original scale which, according to Goodman, \\"[has become] the gold standard measure of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptom severity\\". In creating the Y-BOCS-II, changes were made \\"to the Severity Scale item content and scoring framework, integrating avoidance into the scoring of Severity Scale items, and modifying the Symptom Checklist content and format\\". After reliability tests, Goodman concluded that \\"Taken together, the Y-BOCS-II has excellent psychometric properties in assessing the presence and severity, of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Although the Y-BOCS remains a reliable and valid measure, the Y-BOCS-II may provide an alternative method of assessing symptom presence and severity.\\" Studies have been conducted by members of the Iranian Journal of Psychiatry & Clinical Psychology to determine the accuracy of the Yale‚ÄìBrown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (specifically as it appears in its Persian format). The members applied the scale to a group of individuals and, after ensuring a normal distribution of data, a series of reliability tests were performed. According to the journal, \\"[the] results supported satisfactory validity and reliability of translated form of Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale for research and clinical diagnostic applications\\".  Children's version  The children's version of the Y-BOCS, or the Children's Yale‚ÄìBrown Obsessive Compulsive Scales (CY-BOCS), is a clinician- report questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder from childhood through early adolescence. The CY-BOCS contains 70 questions and takes about 15‚Äì25 minutes. Each question is designed to ask about symptoms of obsessive compulsive behavior, though the exact breakdown of questions is unknown. For each question, children rate the degree to which the question applies on a scale of 0-4. Based on research, this assessment has been found to be statistically valid and reliable, but not necessarily helpful. = Other versions = The CY-BOCS has been adapted into several self- and parent-report versions, designed to be completed by parent and child working together, although most have not been psychometrically validated. However, these versions still ask the child to rate the severity of their obsessive compulsive behaviors and the degree to which each has been impairing. While this measure has been found to be useful in a clinic setting, scores and interpretations are taken with a grain of salt, given the lack of validation. Another version, which is parent-focused, is similar to the original CY-BOCS and is administered to both parent and child by the clinician. This version was distributed by Solvay Pharmaceuticals in the late 1990s, creating an association between the measure and a number of pharmaceutical groups that has caused it to be avoided by most clinicians. Severity cutoff scores for this version have not been empirically determined.

It was founded in 1918, as the Coon-Sanders Novelty Orchestra, by drummer Carleton Coon and pianist Joe Sanders. History Carleton Coon was born February 5, 1894 in Rochester, Minnesota, United States, and his family moved to Lexington, Missouri shortly after his birth. Joe Sanders was born on October 15, 1896 in Thayer, Kansas. Sanders was known as \\"the Old Left Hander\\" because of his skills at baseball, but he gave up playing the sport in the early 1920s to concentrate on dance music as a career. The orchestra began broadcasting in 1922 on clear channel station WDAF, which could be received throughout the United States. They were broadcast in performance at the Muehlebach Hotel in Kansas City. They took the name Nighthawks because they broadcast late at night (11:30pm to 1:00am). By 1924, their fan club had 37,000 members. Fans were encouraged to send in requests for songs by letter, telephone, or telegram. That move became so popular that Western Union set up a ticker tape between Sanders's piano and Coon's drums so the telegrams could be acknowledged during the broadcasts. Their song \\"Nighthawk Blues\\" includes the lines: \\"Tune right in on the radio/Grab a telegram and say 'Hello'.\\" In 1925, they recorded the Paul Whiteman and Fred Rose composition \\"Flamin' Mamie\\". The group left Kansas City for the first time in 1924 for a three- month engagement in a roadhouse in Chicago, Illinois. The orchestra moved to Chicago the same year, where Jules Stein used the profits from a tour he booked for them to establish the Music Corporation of America (MCA), with the orchestra as its first client. The orchestra moved into the Blackhawk in Chicago in 1926. The members of the orchestra at that time were Joe Richolson and Bob Pope, trumpets; Rex Downing, trombone; Harold Thiell, John Thiell and Floyd Estep, saxophones; Joe Sanders, piano; Russ Stout, banjo and guitar; \\"Pop\\" Estep, tuba; Carleton Coon, drums. Teddy Roy also played with the group in the late 1920s. In the following years, the Nighthawks performed at the Blackhawk every winter, doing remote broadcasts over radio station WGN. Their reputation spread coast-to-coast through these broadcasts and the many records they made for Victor Records. They also undertook successful road tours. In 1931, the orchestra moved to New York City, for an 11-month broadcast engagement at the Hotel New Yorker arranged by William S. Paley, who needed a star attraction to induce radio stations to join the Columbia Broadcasting System. At the peak of the band's success, the musicians owned identical Cord automobiles, each in a different color with the name of the Orchestra and the owner embossed on the rear. The Orchestra's popularity showed no signs of abating, and their contract with MCA had another 15 years to run in the spring of 1932 when Carleton Coon came down with a jaw infection and he died on May 4 that year. Sanders attempted to keep the organization going; however, without Coon, the public did not support them. In 1935, he formed his own group and played until the early 1940s, when he became a part-time orchestra leader and studio musician. In his later years he suffered from failing eyesight and other health problems. He died on May 15, 1965, after suffering a stroke. Revivals The Coon Sanders Nighthawks Fans' Bash is held annually on the weekend following Mothers' Day in Huntington, West Virginia to remember the contributions to music made by the Coon Sanders Nighthawks Orchestra and to enjoy the music of the era. This event has been held annually for 44 years. In 2011, the event featured the West End Jazz Band from Chicago, the Toll House Jazz Band from Columbus Ohio, the Sounds of Dixie from Raleigh North Carolina and the Backyard Dixie Jazz Stompers from Huntington West Virginia. Over the years, such musical notables as Curt Hitch, Bill Rank, Earl Roberts, Doc Ryker, Paul Oconnor, Mike Walbridge, Bob Neighbor, Frank Powers, Bob Lefever, Johnny Haynes, Jimmy and Carrie Mazzy, Moe Klippert, Clyde Austin, Nocky Parker, Fred Woodaman and Spiegle Willcox have attended the event. Efforts were being made during 2011 to organize and fund a project to record modern performances of the Coon-Sanders repertoire (as well as performing the music in a series of live concerts). The project was led by Doug Bowles, the Washington, D.C.-based founder of a period big band, the SingCo Rhythm Orchestra.

Built in 1883‚Äì84, it is a prominent example of Ruskinian Gothic architecture, designed by the noted firm of Peabody and Stearns. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description The Bayley House stands in a residential area roughly midway between the villages of Newtonville and Newton Corner, on the south side of Fairmont Avenue, a short way west of its junction with Centre Street. It is a large 2-1/2 story building, built of brick, freestone, red slate, and wood. It has irregular and asymmetric massing typical of the Queen Anne period, including a tower with steeply pitched pyramidal roof at one corner. Its main gables are adorned with stucco and half-timbering. A single-story porch extends around parts of the building, with Union Jack balustrades; a porte-cochere provides access to the main entrance via a semicircular drive. The original carriage house, located at the southwest corner of the property, was torn down in the 1930s when that corner of the lot was sold off and a house was built on the site (on Lombard Street). The original lot extended east to Centre Street, three houses were built in the 1920s on those perimeter lots along Centre St, an additional two houses were built on perimeter lots on Lombard St. in the 1930s. The current owners added a freestanding garage in 2018. The landscape design of the property is said to have been done by William Manning, working for Frederick Law Olmsted. History The Bayley House was designed and built in 1883‚Äì84 by the Boston-based architectural firm of Peabody and Stearns, noted for its commercial and residential architecture in the late 19th century. The house was commissioned by James C. Bayley, a Boston shoe merchant who died within months after ground was broken in late 1883. Bayley's widow, Martha R. Bayley, oversaw the completion of the house, but she and her young children never moved in. The first occupants of the house were the family of Cyrus Anderson, who lived there from 1884 to 1897. Subsequent owners were the Luther Adams family (wife Lizzie), from 1897 through approximately 1901. Adams was a wine merchant in Boston. Also residing with them were daughters Fanny M. and Mabel Adams. Luther Adams died in 1901 at age 68. The house was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Edgar P. Van Etten (President, Boston and Albany Railroad) in 1903. From approximately 1905 to approximately 1919, the home was owned by the Charles H. Breck family who formerly lived at 62 Bellevue Street in Newton. Breck was in the agricultural tools business at 51 North Market in Boston, known as Joseph Breck & Company (now called Breck's, founded by his grandfather Joseph Breck and his father, Charles H.B. Breck). Mrs. Charles H. Breck (Marion A.) was a daughter of Luther Adams. Her sister Fanny also lived here. Other children included Charles H. Breck Jr. and Luther J. Breck. From 1919 to 1925, the home was owned by the John H. O'Brien family, O'Brien was in the wool business at 619 Atlantic Avenue, Boston; his wife was the former Emma M. Matthews. Their children included Byron H. O'Brien and Arnold N. O'Brien. (Arnold, a coal dealer, was born in Dorchester in 1906 and married Helen F. Priest in Keene, New Hampshire on June 10, 1933.) On a 1929 map of Newton, the home is owned by Christopher C. Crowell, a well-known developer and builder of homes in Newton. Land at the perimeters of the lot have been subdivided and start to show homes on them (northeast corner lot at Centre and Fairmont, southeast corner lot at Centre and Lombard). The carriage house still shows on the southwest corner of the lot, that piece of land has not yet been subdivided. There is no evidence that Crowell actually lived in the house, but rather that he purchased it from the O'Brien family for development of the land. From 1931 through 1945, the home was used as the Damon Hall Junior College, run by Frank and Annie Damon. The house was lost in foreclosure to the Charlestown Five Cents Savings Bank, the mortgage holder. A private family (John Ronne, an attorney) purchased the home in foreclosure and then lived in the home from 1945 until approximately 1967 when it was sold to R. Lewis Wright and Sarah G. Wright. The Wrights owned the home from 1967 to 1970, when it was sold to the religious order of Stigmatine Fathers, a Catholic religious congregation of priests and brothers. The order also owned the house next door at 36 Fairmont Avenue. The Stigmatine Fathers owned the home until 1984. The house was returned to use as a private residence in 1984, and has been owned by the current residents since 1995. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 1986.

She is held in highest of esteem, as being the single most ideal example for all women; in terms of her purity and the eventual martyrdom of her son, she is considered to be the Muslim counterpart to the Christian Mary, mother of Jesus; indeed, one of her names is Maryam al-Kubr√°, or \\"the greater Mary\\".Kassam-Hann 2002, p 84.

After Abu Bakr assumed leadership, he asked Muslims to swear allegiance to him, as was the Arab custom of the time. Ali and his followers refused and were harassed and threatened by Abu Bakr's supporters. =Umar at Fatimah's house= According to the Shi'a view, Umar ibn al-Khattab was not only one of Abu Bakr's most zealous supporters, but also his co-conspirator and in some cases his superior. Umar led a party of armed men against Ali's house in Medina and called for Ali and his men to come out and swear allegiance to Abu Bakr, who they had decided would take power in the meeting at Saqifah. Umar and Khalid ibn Walid threatened to burn the house down if they did not submit.

They proceeded by stripping Fatima of all financial means: The land of Fadak, which Shi'a believe was a gift from Muhammad to her before the Conquest of Mecca,Jafri 1979 p 62; citing Yaqubi II p 127, Tabarsi Ihtijaj I pp 131-149 and others. was confiscated and any inheritance due to her was denied since Abu Bakr had conveniently been the only one to hear Muhammad state that \\"prophets do not leave an inheritance\\".Jafri 1979 p 62; citing Bukhari and Yaqubi. Fatima opposed this confiscation, and contested Abu Bakr's statements: She still had the merit of being Muhammad's daughter and people were still watching, although they were in shock over how the events had turned out. However, even though Fatima and Ali successfully contested Abu Bakr's claim, Abu Bakr refused to return her property as this would jeopardize their newly gained power. Fatima made one last attempt: She interrupted Abu Bakr's speech in the mosque of Medinah, with a long speech of her own. After this speech, Abu Bakr repented and went to return the deed to the land. However, he was stopped by Umar, who grabbed Abu Bakr's beard and demanded an explanation, forcing him to stop jeopardizing the mission. Abu Bakr yet again changed his mind. Breach in relations This caused a major breach in their relations, she refused to talk to Abu Bakr until her death, something noted in Sunni hadith collections.Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim The question of this inheritance is one of the most debated points in the Sunni/Shi'a conflict. In effect, Abu Bakr's hands were tied: if he acknowledged her claim to Fadak, it would lend credence to her lineage's claim to the succession of Muhhammad.Jafri 1979 p 63 Shia continue that some time later, it became evident that Fatima would not be recovering from her wounds. She still had the people's heart as she was Muhammad's favorite and only biological daughter and was also the mother of Muhammad's only grandchildren. Abu Bakr and Umar went to her house to seek her. Fatimah refused to answer them, their army including them burned the door. That door fell on Fatimah and injured her severely. This pain caused by the door falling on her was felt by her for the rest of her life such that she walked holding her back. This barbaric action by Umar and Abu Bakr also caused the death of Fatimah's unborn son, Mohsin.Tarikh al- Khulafa, vol 1 p 20 cited in Muhammad al-Tijani Then I was Guided, chapter \\"The Opinion of the Companions about each other\\". Fatimah, still angered that Abu Bakr was refusing her inheritance, angrily rebuked them: :\\"God be my witness that you two have offended me. In every prayer I curse you and will continue cursing you until I see my father and complain against you.\\".Peshawar Nights on Al-Islam.org Prophet Muhammed also said: \\"whoever angers fatimah,angers me.\\" Last period When Fatima was ill with the final sickness which caused her death, the wives of the emigrants and companions of Muhammad went out visit her to ask how she was feeling. In reply to them, after asking for the blessings of God for her father, Muhammad, she said: Death Ashura day in Arak with a Fatimid green flag. Fatima did not survive long after the demise of her father. Sources differ from one month to six months.Jafri, S.H.M. The Origins and Early Development of Shi'a Islam. Longman, New York; 1979 p59. According to numerous Shi'a sources, because of the rift between her and the Abu Bakr faction, before her death she made these requests of her husband: * O Ali, you will personally perform my funeral rites. * Those who have displeased me should not be allowed to attend my funeral. * My corpse should be carried to the graveyard at night.at-Tabari I p1825; Bukhari Sahih V p288 and others, cited in Jafri 1979 p63 Ali did as she wished: she was buried at night, and accompanied to the grave by her relatives and sons. The burial was done secretly, so that Abu Bakr and Umar could not attend. The Shi'a believe that Fatima died at the age of eighteen in Medina. This caused great grief to her husband. Eventually, in accordance with another part of her will, Ali married the woman of Fatima's choice, so that Fatima's children would be well taken care of. After Fatima's death, Ali renewed the claim to the properties, but was again denied by Abu Bakr.Sahih Muslim Shi'a gave Fatima Zahra many titles of praise. See List of Shi'a titles for Fatima Zahra Legacy In Iran, her birthday was chosen as the date for National Women's Day, and annual mowludi or birthday celebrations are held in her honor by Iranian women; the themes routinely reflected in sermons at these functions are those of Fatimah's example as a pious daughter and wife and caring mother, and her simple lifestyle.Kalinock, Sabine. \\"Between party and devotion: Mowludi of Tehran women.\\" Critique: Critical Middle Eastern Studies. Fall 2003, Vol. 12 Issue 2, p173-187. Muhammad said \\"Every mothers children are associated with their father except for the children of Fatimah for I am their father and lineage\\". Thus descendants of Fatimah are descendants of Muhammad, and part of his Bayt. Shia Islam believe this and tree placed below depict Fatimid and all other sects as vast family of Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and, Husayn.

Until the worldwide release of SEGA Pocket Club Manager (Pro Soccer Club o Tsukurou!ROAD TO WORLD in Japan) on Android and iOS platform in May 2018, it was the only game in the SakaTsuku series to be localized for the Western market. Game Information The game has heavy role-playing video game elements with a running story and characters alongside the more regular management side of the game. Unlike other football management titles, in this game the player are also the chairman and founder of the club. The game is set around the 2005-06 footballing season, coming off of the league promotion playoffs at the end of the 2004-05 football season. The game story begins with a brief introduction concerning the history of football. After this, the player is then led to creating their own football club, where the hometown and base of the club is chosen. In total there are six countries the club can be based in: England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. While players can create teams based in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Monaco, they will still play in the English and French league systems, respectively. After this, the name of the owner of the club, the colour and design of the club kit, the team's playing style and club secretary are chosen. The story then continues. Following this, the game slides onto a series of newspaper headlines, such as chronicling the formation of the player's team and its rise to the third tier of the respective country's league system. The game officially starts as the playoffs for the 2nd Division of the country which the club is based in begin. If the player's club are knocked out of this tournament, the player gets an early Game Over. There are three other ways in which the game may end. These are: *Ranking last position in the country's 2nd division two seasons in a row. *Becoming bankrupt financially, causing the club to close down. *The player being unable to provide 16 uninjured and non-tied players for a match. In addition, the game provides a \\"Vs. Mode\\", which plays more like a conventional football game despite only allowing management controls, and allows players to choose teams from outside the six main leagues all over the world, including national teams, for friendly matches and custom tournaments. Teams created in the main game may be imported to Virtua Pro Football. Reception When the game was first released, reception to the game was mixed with most reviewers seemingly either loving or hating it. However, since then, much criticism has aroused, mainly due to the fact the game takes a long period of time to begin its actual story and gameplay. Additionally, similar to the other titles, there is an increased quantity of unlicensed factors in the game. Nonetheless, the game still has its advocates. The Neo-Seeker forum for LMAST was the second highest used in 2008 (only behind FIFA 2007) and is still used to this day. A tutorial video of the game has 13,000 views on YouTube and there have been a number of campaigns for a sequel. The game was described as 'a slow-building addictive, mesmeric tour de force of a sporting simulation, which prevails over FIFA, PES and Football Manager.' by game critic Craig Navarro.

Most extant sources about ancient Greek boxing are fragmentary or legendary, making it difficult to reconstruct the rules, customs and history surrounding this activity in great detail. Still, it is clear that gloved boxing bouts were a significant part of ancient Greek athletic culture throughout the early classical period. Origins There is archeological and artistic evidence of ancient Greek boxing (œÄœçŒæ - pyxœÄœçŒæ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library or œÄœÖŒ≥ŒºŒÆ - pygmeœÄœÖŒ≥ŒºŒÆ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library in Œëncient Greek) as early as the Minoan and Mycenaean periods. There are numerous legends about the origins of boxing in Greece. One legend holds that the heroic ruler Theseus invented a form of boxing in which two men sat face to face and beat each other with their fists until one of them was killed. In time, the boxers began to fight while standing and wearing gloves (with spikes) and wrappings on their arms below the elbows, but otherwise they fought naked. According to the Iliad, Mycenaean warriors included boxing among their competitions honoring the fallen, though it is possible that the Homeric epics reflect later Greek culture. Boxing was among the contests held in memorial of Achilles' slain friend Patroclus, toward the end of the Trojan war. It was in commemoration of Patroclus that the Greeks later introduced boxing (pygme / pygmachia) to the Olympic Games in 688 BCE. Participants trained on punching bags (called a korykos). Fighters wore leather straps (called himantes) over their hands (leaving the fingers free), wrists, and sometimes breast, to protect themselves from injury. There was no protection for the face or head. The scholar and historian Philostratus maintained that boxing was originally developed in Sparta. The early Spartans believed helmets were unnecessary and boxing prepared them for the inevitable blows to the head they would receive in battle.Swaddling, Judith. The Ancient Olympic Games. 2nd ed. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1999. However, Spartans never participated in the competitive aspect of boxing, believing the means of defeat to be dishonorable.Craig, Steve. Sports and Games of the Ancients. Sports and Games Through History Series. Series Advisor Andrew Leibs. Westport, Connecticut and London: Greenwood Press, 2002 Equipment Minoan youths boxing (BCE 1500), Knossos fresco. This is the earliest known evidence for the use of gloves. The style of protection utilized on the hands and knuckles could determine the style of fighting for the competitors. From the time of the Iliad until around 500 BCE, himantes were used as protection for the knuckles and hand. They were thongs of ox hide approximately long that were wrapped around the hands and knuckles numerous times. The thongs usually had loops in which an athlete could insert four of his fingers and clench them together in a fist. Generally, this was the only form of protection worn by participants from the era of Homer until the end of the fifth century. This is in contrast to modern boxing, which utilizes thick, padded gloves. Classical sources describe these as \\"soft gloves\\", though modern study has indicated that these thongs were far from soft and were protection for the knuckles, not to soften the blow to the opponent. They can be found on many vases excavated from the fifth and sixth century BCE. In around 400 BCE sphairai were introduced. The sphairai were very similar to himantes. The only notable difference was that they contained a padded interior when wrapped around the hands and the exterior of the thong was notably more rigid and hard. In addition, \\"sharp thongs\\" were introduced during this time period to facilitate greater damage and remained popular up until around 200 CE.Swaddling, op. cit. Soon before the implementation of the sphairai, the oxys were introduced to boxing. They consisted of several thick leather bands encircling the hand, wrist, and forearm. A band of fleece was placed on the forearm to wipe away sweat. Leather braces extended up the forearm to give greater support when punching and the knuckles were reinforced with leather as well.Miller, Stephen G. Ancient Greek Athletics. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2004. Korykos were the equivalent to modern punching bags. They were used for practice in the Palaestra and were filled with sand, flour, or millet. They were commonly depicted in art depicting boxing of the time. Rules and Characteristics The right boxer signals giving up by raising his finger high (ca. BCE 500). Boxers represented on a Panathenaic amphora. Currently located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The currently accepted rules of ancient Greek boxing are based on historical references and images. Because of the few intact sources and references to the sport, the rules can only be inferred.Craig, Swaddling, Miller, op. cit. *No holds or wrestling *Any type of blow with the hand was allowed but no gouging with the fingers *No ring was used *There were no rounds or time limits *Victory was decided when one fighter gave up or was incapacitated *No weight- classes, opponents were selected by chance *Judges enforced the rules by beating offenders with a switch or whip *Fighters could opt to exchange blows undefended if the fight lasted too long Unlike modern boxing, the Greeks did not enclose the competitors in a ring to encourage fighting in close quarters. Therefore, most boxers fought defensively as opposed to offensively to encourage patience and caution. In addition, boxing in Ancient Greece was not divided into individual rounds. Competitors fought until finish, usually by surrender or mutual exhaustion. Felled boxers could be attacked without consequence, just as if they were standing. While the practice of dividing boxers into weight classes is popular in the modern world, it was an unheard of practice for the Greeks. Typically, any man who wished to participate in the event was welcome to regardless of strength or muscle mass, and participants competed with each other through random drawings. The precise rules of boxing in antiquity cannot be known for certain, and are thus inferred from historical references and images. It is believed that any type of blow with the hand was permitted, though using the hands to gouge at the eyeballs was not. Holding or wrestling one's opponent was also prohibited. If the fight lasted too long due to the tenacity of the competitors, the athletes could choose to exchange blows undefended to speed up the process. Judges probably enforced the rules by beating the offenders with a switch or a whip.

He was the uncle of Pope Gregory XIV. Biography In 1601, Pope Clement VIII associated Count Luigi Bevilacqua and his two brothers, Conte Bonifazio IV (1571‚Äì1627) and Conte Alfonso II (1565‚Äì1610), with his own family granting them use of his family‚Äôs Aldobrandini Coat of Arms and the right to appoint courts and judges in their territories. They were also made Counts of the Palace and Knights of the Lateran and of the Golden Spur. Luigi also acquired citizenship in Rome, Bologna, Mantua and Montferrat with the Castle of Fontanile, Perugia, and Assisi. In 1607, Pope Paul V appointed him Captain of the Curiasses and the Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando I gave him the Leadership of the Helmets. In addition, Clement made Bonifazio a cardinal in 1599.David Cheney, Bonifazio Bevilacqua Aldobrandini, su Catholic-Hierarchy.org. Bonifazio was a ‚Äúsecret waiter‚Äù of Pope Gregory XIII in his youth, and received his doctorate in law at the University of Padua. Later, Bonifazio became Archdeacon of Ferrara and the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. Bonifazio was also elected Governor of Fano, and Governor of the Duchy of Camerino which were part of the Papal States at the time. During the conclave of Pope Gregory XV, Bonifazio formed strong alliances on the side of the French against Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio and the Spanish. When Gregory became pope, he gave Bonifazio citizenship in the Republic of Lucca. Due to the political animosity among the cardinals during his election, Pope Gregory XV abolished these abuses by making the balloting secret with no cardinal able to vote for himself. When Bonifacio was made Cardinal, he was in charge of the diocese of Sabina, and Perugia, both in Umbria. He was also made the Prefect of the Cardinal‚Äôs Consul, Referendario of the Cardinal‚Äôs Senate, and elected Prefect of all of the Catholic Church‚Äôs Assemblies. Pope Clement VIII bestowed his own family name, Aldobrandini, with all hereditary rights to Bonifazio since he loved him like a son. Bonifazio had the sepulchral monument of Torquato Tasso built in the church of S. Onofrio al Gianicolo in memory of one of his closest and dearest friends. Bonifacio is buried in a beautiful tomb in the Chapel of Saint Sebastiano Martire in the Church of Saint Andrea della Valle in Rome.Gaspare De Caro, BEVILACQUA, Bonifazio, in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, vol. 9, Roma, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1967. The Bevilacqua family exercised a tremendous amount of power within the Catholic Church through Cardinal Bonifacio and his aunt. Countess Isabella Bevilacqua (1519‚Äì1589) married Cavaliere Lorenzo Sfondrati, the Patrizio of Cremona. Lorenzo‚Äôs brother, Francesco, was made a cardinal by Pope Paul III in 1544. Francesco was a Senator of Milan and when his wife, Sigismonda d‚ÄôEste, died, he became a cardinal. Francesco‚Äôs son, Niccol√≤, became Pope Gregory XIV on 5 December 1590 and the next year made his nephew Paolo Emilio Sfondrati a cardinal.David Cheney, Bonifazio Bevilacqua Aldobrandini, su Catholic-Hierarchy.org. Arts Cardinal Bonifazio was a great patron of the arts. He constructed the Church della Madonna della Neve in Cervia with his relatives the Capponi. The Capponi family built the Church and Monastery of Santo Spirito in Florence in 1360 by Gino Capponi. Gino was famous for conquering Pisa for the Florentines in 1404. His son Neri, whose portrait is done in basso-relief by Simone di Betto in the church, was distinguished in the war of the Florentines against the Duke of Milan, Cosimo de' Medici. His grandson Piero was threatened by Charles VIII of France to surrender or Charles VIII would ‚Äúsound his trumpets for the final attack‚Äù. Piero responded by saying, \\"Then, we shall sound our bells.\\" Piero Capponi was killed in 1496 in an assault against the Pisans. He was buried in the same tomb as his great-grandfather Gino which is next to the monument of Cardinal Luigi Capponi, a close friend of Cardinal Bonifazio.Gaspare De Caro, BEVILACQUA, Bonifazio, in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, vol. 9, Roma, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1967. Cardinal Bevilacqua was a major patron of Ventura Salimbeni, the son of the Sienese artist Arcangelo Salimbeni (1567‚Äì1589), and Battista Focari, widow of Eugenio Vanni. Ventura was first taught painting in his native Siena by his father, as was his half-brother Francesco Vanni. Cardinal Bonifazio introduced Ventura to Pope Sixtus V (1585‚Äì90) in 1588. Ventura received his first commission for the fresco decoration of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (the Vatican Library) by the pope. During 1590‚Äì91, Salimbeni received commissions from Cardinal Bevilacqua to decorate Ges√π and Santa Maria Maggiore churches in Rome. In 1595, and the Church of Santa Trinita and the Church of Santa Spirito in Siena utilizing the Mannerist style. Subsequently, Cardinal Bonifacio Bevilacqua commissioned Salimbeni to paint the Betrothal of the Virgin in the diocese‚Äôs seminary in Foligno while Bonifazio was governor. Salimbeni was commissioned to paint Saint Carl Borromeo Adores the Name of Jesus for the cathedral of Saint Lawrence in Grosseto. Cardinal Bevilacqua was a supporter of the cult of the Name of Jesus instituted by Saint Bernardino and sanctioned by Pope Eugene IV in 1432. His next work, Concert of Angels, is stylistically very similar to Betrothal of the Virgin. For almost all of his painting cycles he first created detailed drawings. The few engravings that Salimbeni executed for the cardinal were made in Rome. Of these, only seven survive, dated between 1589 and 1594.Gaspare De Caro, BEVILACQUA, Bonifazio, in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, vol. 9, Roma, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1967. In Perugia, he decorated the Church of San Pietro. After completing his fresco in the church called Cavaleriato del Esperon de Oro, Cardinal Bevilacqua bestowed Ventura Salimbeni with the Bevilacqua family name. From that time, he became known as Il Cavaliere Ventura Salimbeni Bevilacqua. The title of Cavaliere was similar to being knighted. While knighthood was the first and most common of Italy's entitlements, it is not hereditary as are the royal titles. Knighthood is an individual title conferred by members of an Italian royal family for an individual‚Äôs outstanding or meritorious service. In 1612, one year before Salimbeni died, he painted a portrait in celebration of Bonifacio‚Äôs elevation to the cardinalate. This is a reference to the letter sent by Pope Clement VIII on April 3, 1598 granting Bonifacio with dispensation for not having reached the canonical age to accept his election by the College of Cardinals to the title of Patriarch of Constantinople. Bonifazio was only 27 years of age; three years younger than the canonical age to be elected a Patriarch.David Cheney, Bonifazio Bevilacqua Aldobrandini, su Catholic- Hierarchy.org. In 1763, Cardinal Bonifacio‚Äôs portrait was incorporated as part of Cardinal Giovanni Maria Riminaldi‚Äôs prestigious collection of nineteen portraits of famous cardinals at the Civic Museum of Ferrara in the Schifanoia Palace.

The station was opened on December 30, 1996, as part of the first stage extension of the Syretsky radius. The Syretsky radius was planned in the early 1980s when construction of the whole line began. Open opening of the line in 1989, the tunnel boring to the northwest continued, but in line of economic problems during the early 1990s, construction pace was very slow paced. Also the original first stage of the radius was supposed to open with two stations, this and Lvivska Brama. However, due to geological projects with Lvivska Brama, works on the station were stopped in the early 1990s. Lukyanivska was opened in 1996 as the first deep level station following the independence of Ukraine with a new original design (stations opened along the Pechersky radius in 1991-1994 were all from architecture which dates to Soviet-time designs, when they were starting to be built). In such a case Lukyanivska for the first time, after the turbulent early 1990s, demonstrated an insight into a future. The design, work of architects N. Alyoshkin, V. Gnevyshev and T. Tselikovskaya, incorporates a classic pylon tri-vault design with plastered ceilings and granite floor. Darker black marble is used for lower parts of the pylon, whilst white marble is used for the top and floor. One of the station's most featured details is lighting which consists of a metallic curved pipes with a standard filament light bulb, giving the appearance of a sprouting flower. The large quantity of these elements highlight the bright and cheerful design of the station. However, when the station was built, due to the low quality of the engineering from the constant breaks in construction due to financial reasons, the hydroisolation of the station was not properly done. As a result, what are meant to be bright white ceilings, are now stained with constant leakages from the soil water. This has a profound impact on the overall appearance of the station. The station is situated in the middle of the Lukyanivska Square, where the large white-marble faced vestibule structure was built (effectively halving the square in process). The upper level of the vestibule is occupied by a store. The opening of the station, was long- awaited, as it had a considerable impact on the passenger traffic on stations of the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line, although four years later after the opening of the second stage of the radius with the station Dorohozhychi, and Lukyanivska ceasing to be the terminus, there was a notable drop. However most of the passenger traffic that is or was is insignificant to what it will be after the opening of the Hlubochitska station of the Podilsko-Voskresenska Line in 2015, and Lukianivska becoming a transfer station. The connection will likely include a link to the far end of the central hall, which is now occupied by a white marble wall.

It ran between M-77 at Germfask and M-28 near McMillan. The highway connected both small towns situated around Manistique Lake when it was designated with the rest of the original state highways in 1919. The section north of Helmer on the east side of the lake ran concurrently with M-135 after the latter's creation in the late 1920s. M-98 was extended at the end of the 1940s before the whole trunkline was removed from the highway system in the 1960s. Since the 1970s, part of M-98 has been designated as one of the two County Road H-44s in the state. Route description M-98 started at a junction with M-77 in Germfask next to the Seney National Wildlife Refuge, a managed wetland in Schoolcraft County. The highway followed Ten Curves Road east and then north out town. The trunkline turned back due east and crosses the Fox River before a set of curves that shifted the highway along the Schoolcraft‚ÄìLuce county line to pass north of Big Manistique Lake. Ten Curves Road passes between the Big and North Manistee lakes as it enters the community of Helmer in Luce County. There, M-98 intersected M-135, and the two ran concurrently north along Manistique Lakes Road. M-98/M-135 turned due east to intersect M-28 southwest of McMillan near East Lake. History M-98 was first designated by July 1, 1919, at the same time as the initial state highway system was signed. In 1929, M-135 was designated, creating the concurrency along the last several miles of M-98. By 1936, a series of corners were straightened out on the western end of M-98 near Germfask. In late 1949 or early 1950, M-28 was realigned to take an angled route southeasterly out of McMillan. The east‚Äìwest section of the previous M-28 routing was added to M-98 while the north‚Äìsouth segment was added to M-135. By the middle of 1958, M-135 was shifted to follow M-98, removing the roadway section added to its routing previously; this change made M-98 and M-135 concurrent north of Helmer all the way to M-28 once again. M-98 was removed from the state trunkline system in late 1960 or early 1961, and the designation was decommissioned at that time. The M-98 designation has not been reused since. The routing was then assigned as a County Road H-44 after October 5, 1970, along the east‚Äìwest section of the former M-98. The former M-98/M-135 was given the H-33 moniker at the same time. Both roads have retained those designations ever since. The Luce County Road Commission has also assigned the former highway the designations County Road 98 (CR 98) along Ten Curves Road and CR 135 on Manistique Lakes Road since taking control back from the state in the 1960s.

She was an ally of the Legion of Super-Heroes prior to Zero Hour. Fictional character biography =Pre-Zero Hour= Grava of the Earth colony Extal was a long- time fan of Star Boy, and wanted desperately to become a member of the Legion. Hoping to gain superpowers she foolishly jumped from a space ship into the tail of a passing comet - failing to realize that Star Boy had flown through a particular comet while inside a starship, rather than unprotected by anything more than a futuristic space-suit. The ploy worked and the comet gave her the ability to fly in the vacuum of space as well as the ability to emit various \\"comet-like gases.\\" The comet tail also altered Grava's physical form, giving her hair the appearance of streaming flames; presented as nominally humanoid in flashback, her father appeared to be some species derived from something akin to rats, and this would suggest she was of mixed parentage or possibly adopted. In Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes #336 (June 1986), reserve Legionnaire Bouncing Boy described to his comrade Superboy how he came to meet the young heroine while he was on a goodwill tour to a planet called Quaal III; Comet Queen ambushed him in the hotel and introduced herself, declaring him her very own \\"personal Legionnaire.\\" Bouncing Boy rejected Comet Queen's initial bid for membership on the grounds that she has not proven herself. Later, he finds out from several hotel guests, including Grava's own father, that the girl had gone off in a fit of dejection to search for Quaal III's lava seas to seek out the planet's mythical natives, as a \\"super-feat\\" to prove herself worthy - mirroring Supergirl's bid to join the Legion by excavating various Earthling artifacts. Instead, Bouncing Boy and Comet Queen ended up in a near-death situation until they work together, combining their powers, and finding an escape. As a result of Comet Queen's adventure with Bouncing Boy, she was accepted into the Legion Academy training program, located at Montauk Point (a safe distance from the Legion itself) and taught by Bouncing Boy and his wife Duo Damsel. It is here that she became friends with other Legion hopefuls, including Superman's supposed descendant Laurel Kent, and Shadow Lass' cousin Shadow Kid. Comet Queen's unusual appearance is paired with eccentric speech patterns ‚Äì her dialogue is peppered with bizarre private slang that incorporates words relating to celestial bodies seemingly at random. In particular, she enjoys saying things like: \\"C-speed limit,\\" \\"star-particles,\\" \\"totally gravitied,\\" \\"starshine,\\" and \\"go nova.\\" Her dialogue is usually presented in square, yellow-tinged speech balloons with thick lines, and her idiosyncratic rhythms baffle those around her, often as a spoof of stereotypical Valley Girl style. She was later recruited into a short-lived version of the Legion of Substitute Heroes; this version is formed by Cosmic Boy in order to deal with special missions.Legion of Super-Heroes Annual #3 1987 Other members of this group include Night Girl, Karate Kid II, as well as her former teachers Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel. =Post-Zero Hour= Comet Queen makes two appearances after Zero Hour: Crisis in Time, in Legionnaires #43 (December 1996), and later as a member of the new Legion Academy in Legion #25. = Post-Infinite Crisis/52 = Comet Queen later appears in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5, among many Legionnaires from alternate realities and Legion-related characters who have been brought to fight the Time Trapper. Comet Queen made another appearance in Legion of Super-Heroes #6, as part of the active class at the Legion Academy. Later in that series many Legionaries were considered lost presumed dead. The legion was shorthanded and she and several members of the academy were inducted into the legion. After a couple issues she betrayed the Legion to their enemies the Dominators. The book got canceled before the story line got resolved. Powers and abilities After exposure to a comet's tail, Comet Queen gained the ability to fly, even in the vacuum of space. She can also emit a variety of noxious gases that can be used to stun an opponent.

He is a multi- instrumentalist who plays violin, guitar, bass, and piano. Career Nichols co-wrote many songs with lyricists Paul Williams, Tony Asher, and Bill Lane. Asher and Nichols co-wrote several songs on Nichols' debut album Roger Nichols And The Small Circle Of Friends (A&M; Records, 1968) which was produced by Tommy LiPuma, engineered by Bruce Botnick and featured session contributions from Van Dyke Parks, Randy Newman and Lenny Waronker. Although the album was not a big seller, A&M; co-owner Herb Alpert recommended that Nichols be hired by A&M; publishing as a staff songwriter, and it was during this period that he was introduced to Paul Williams. Nichols' collaborations with Paul Williams include \\"We've Only Just Begun\\" (performed by The Carpenters), which was originally written for a Crocker Bank commercial. They were commissioned to write a jingle after a bank executive heard Nichols' album, and it was composed in a matter of hours on the last day before the deadline. The commercial (sung by Williams) was heard on TV by Richard Carpenter, who believed it had hit potential and his group The Carpenters subsequently recorded a version, which became a major hit for them in late 1970. It was nominated for a Grammy for Song of the Year, was included on BMI's million performances list and received an award for selling a million copies of sheet music. The song was also covered by Curtis Mayfield among many others. \\"Times of Your Life\\", written with Lane and performed by Paul Anka, had reached number one on the Adult Contemporary chart (3‚Äì10 January 1976). Another Nichols-Williams song, \\"Out in the Country\\" by Three Dog Night (later covered by R.E.M.), reached the Top Ten. Six months later, \\"Rainy Days and Mondays\\" was another gold record by The Carpenters and Nichols' third gold record in a single year. Other hits were The Carpenters' \\"I Won't Last a Day Without You\\", Art Garfunkel's \\"Travelin' Boy\\" (covered by Rumer) and \\"I Never Had It So Good\\" (covered by Barbra Streisand). He also scored the theme song from Hart to Hart with a lyric by Lane. Nichols released a Japan-only CD in 1995 called \\"Roger Nichols and a Circle of Friends -- Be Gentle With My Heart\\", featuring vocalist Sheila O'Connell-Roussell, on which he recorded some of his best- known tunes, including \\"We've Only Just Begun\\", \\"I Won't Last a Day Without You\\", and \\"Rainy Days and Mondays\\" (which features Paul Williams on guest vocal). He also released a CD in 2007 with the original Small Circle of Friends called Full Circle which brought together the group to cover many of Nichols hits for other bands, including \\"Out in the Country\\" and \\"Let Me Be the One\\" as well as other tunes penned during Roger's late-1960s heyday. 2008 saw an upgraded release of \\"Full Circle\\" issued by Steve Stanley's Now Sounds label.

She had much political influence in her adopted country and with her husband did much to improve the welfare of the Electorate of Bavaria. Princess of Savoy Born at the Castello del Valentino in Turin, she was the older of twin girls; her sister Princess Catherine Beatrice of Savoy died in Turin 26 August 1637. On 7 October 1637 she lost her father Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy, when she was just one year old. Her mother, Christine of France, was the daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici. After the death of her father, her mother served as Regent of Savoy on behalf of two of Henriette Adelaide's brothers: Francis Hyacinth (1632‚Äì1638), then Charles Emmanuel II (1634‚Äì1675) after the older brother died. Her uncles Prince Maurice of Savoy and Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano, intrigued against their sister-in-law and her French entourage. When the first heir Francis Hyacinth died in 1638, the brothers Maurice and Thomas started the Piedmontese Civil War with Spanish support. The two parties in the war were known as the \\"principisti\\" (supporters of the princes) and \\"madamisti\\" (supporters of \\"Madama Reale,\\" the Regent Christine ). With the support of her brother, King Louis XIII of France, Marie Christine was able to defeat the challenge to her rule. Electress of Bavaria On 8 December 1650 Henriette married Ferdinand Maria, heir to the Electorate of Bavaria future. The next year he became Elector upon the death of his father Maximilian. Henriette Adelaide had a strong influence on Bavarian foreign affairs in favor of France, whose royal family counted her mother as a member. This led to an alliance between France and Bavaria against Austria. One of the results of the alliance was the marriage of Henriette's eldest daughter Maria Anna and her cousin Louis, Dauphin of France (le Grand Dauphin), in 1680. She had a leading role in the building of Nymphenburg Palace and the Theatine Church in Munich. Many Italian artists were invited to Munich, and she also introduced Italian opera to the court of Bavaria. Henriette died in Munich and was buried in the Theatine Church - the church she and her husband built as a gesture of thanks for the birth of the long-awaited heir to the Bavarian crown, Prince Maximilan II Emanuel, in 1662.

The intuitive idea may be seen in the case of the set of all lattices in a Euclidean space E. There these are only certain of the closed subgroups: others can be found by in a sense taking limiting cases or degenerating a certain sequence of lattices. One can find linear subspaces or discrete groups that are lattices in a subspace, depending on how one takes a limit. This phenomenon suggests that the set of all closed subgroups carries a useful topology. This topology can be derived from the Vietoris topology construction, a topological structure on all non-empty subsets of a space. More precisely, it is an adaptation of the Fell topology construction, which itself derives from the Vietoris topology concept.

A tributary of the River Lea, it rises to the south-west of Sandon in the hills northeast of Stevenage and joins the Lea at Hartham Common in Hertford. Watermills In medieval times there were a number of watermills along the course of the Beane. A few of the buildings and mill races survive. * Sele Mill, Hertford, is perhaps the site with the most historical interest. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book.SELE HOUSE including front railings (1268844). Historic England Its main claim to fame is that in the 15th century the facility was converted for use as a paper mill and was, as far as is known, the earliest paper mill in England. It is not clear when paper production began there, although 1488 has been suggested, but it was certainly underway in the 1490s. Paper from Sele Mill, supplied by John Tate, was used in publications from that decade, and the mill was visited by Henry VII in 1498 and 1499. Despite this sign of royal favour, paper production did not continue there for long, and appears to have ceased by the time the paper maker John Tate made his will in 1507.Richard L. Hills, ‚ÄòTate, John (c.1448‚Äì1507/8)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 24 June 2015. Subscription or UK public library membership required. * Walkern Mill, which was rebuilt in the 19th century, is a grade II listed building. Abstraction The Beane valley remains mainly rural in character. However, Hertfordshire's population increased substantially in the second half of the twentieth century, and the consequent demand for water has affected rivers such as the Beane and the Mimram. In the case of the Beane, a licence was given to abstract water near Aston for Stevenage's water supply. The river has since been adversely affected by over- exploitation of the chalk aquifer in its upper reaches. The photo shows a dry section south of Walkern where from the 1990s until about 2014 there was only seasonal flow. An indication of the scale of the decline in flow is that the section at Walkern was once big enough to power a watermill and to support watercress beds.Walkern Mill Dry bed of the Beane near Aston, Hertfordshire in 2006 The lower Beane is more robust and there has continued to be regular flow through Watton-at-Stone, Stapleford and Waterford until the confluence with the River Lea. However, overall the river has performed badly in assessments by the Environment Agency of flow level. Restoration The state of the upper Beane resulted in calls for the river's restoration. The management plan for the river includes the objective that there is adequate flow along the length of the river to support a ‚Äògood status‚Äô chalk stream ecology (as defined by the European Union's Water Framework Directive). River Beane: Catchment management plan www.riverleacatchment.org.uk One possible approach to the restoration of the upper Beane which was discussed was to use recycled water from sewage treatment works. Sewage from the Stevenage area bypassed the river, being pumped down the Beane valley to Rye Meads near Hertford for treatment and eventual discharge into the River Stort. However, the water could theoretically have been discharged into the Beane if treated further upstream.Waste Water Report, Halcrow Group In the event another option was chosen. Affinity Water was told to take less water from its pumping station near Aston, even though obtaining water from a less environmentally damaging source was difficult as the River Lea's catchment area as a whole is under pressure. There have been initiatives to improve the condition of lower stretches of the river, for example where it passes through the Woodhall Park estate near Watton. Here the river has been modified by an 18th-century landscaping project which had the adverse consequence of impeding fish passage. Access Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust (HMWT) has launched a circular trail at Waterford, which includes some scenic sections of the River Beane.

The highway served as a connector between US Highway 23 (US 23) and the former routing of US 10, which ran along what is now the Interstate 75 (I-75) corridor. The highway connected the downtown areas of each community as well as running through then-rural areas of Genesee and Oakland counties. The trunkline was decommissioned in late 1960, removing it from the system. Route description Immediately before decommissioning, M-87 began at a junction with Business US 23 (Bus. US 23, Leroy Street) east of the Shiawassee River in the town of Fenton. From there the road traveled to the east along Main Street, where it crossed a branch rail line of the present-day CSX Transportation and headed east out of town in Genesee County. After about , the highway crossed into Oakland County and followed Grange Hall Road south of Seven Lakes State Park. The road then turned south in the town of Holly along Saginaw Street. Near Bevins Lake, the street curved to the east around the end of the lake. The highway turned east on Maple Street and ran south of Simonson Lake as it continued eastward out of Holly. The road crossed a branch line of the present day Canadian National Railway in Springfield Township. The trunkline continued to the east and southeast through rural areas before terminating at US 10 (Dixie Highway).

FOCUS established its pilot program in January 1998 at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas, with two staff members and 24 students. Curtis Martin discussed the mission of the organization with Pope John Paul II that same year. At the invitation of Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, former Archbishop of Denver, a FOCUS program was established in the fall of 1998 at the University of Northern Colorado, Greeley. The group is now headquartered outside of Denver. FOCUS currently has over 500 full-time staff members. FOCUS takes recent college graduates, trains them in the teachings of the Catholic Church, Scripture and practical aspects of ministry, and sends them out typically in teams of four to serve on college campuses. FOCUS staff members make an initial two-year commitment to this full-time work on campus. FOCUS works with the approval of the local bishop and the support of the local pastor, as well as existing campus ministries.\\"Fellowship of Catholic University Students Heads Back to Campus, Adding 16 New Schools\\", National Catholic Register, September2, 2012 Operations The greater part of FOCUS' work occurs in Bible studies, small groups that meet weekly to discuss a passage of Scripture, typically led by a missionary for the organization. The organization calls this small-group model \\"the method modeled by the master,\\" that is, it purports to base its modes of evangelization off of Jesus' actions in the gospels. FOCUS Bible studies are either all-male or all-female. Meetings generally follow formats and lesson plans distributed by the organization and available online. A Bible study leader will typically meet one-on-one with a couple of select members once a week outside of study sessions in what are called \\"discipleship\\" sessions. Missionaries are typically recent graduates who have some experience with the organization's Bible studies as undergraduates, who dedicate a year or two of service stationed on a campus with a FOCUS program. Missionaries, who make a living by fundraising salaries, undergo a five-week training program at the organization's Denver Support Center the summer prior to their assignments. FOCUS also hosts a pair of yearly conferences which occur on alternating years. The larger of the two, SEEK, is largely educational and social in nature. The smaller, the Student Leadership Summit (SLS), is more directly aimed at training undergraduates and other young and ministerial professionals in the organization's methods. Both conferences feature high-profile speakers, exhibitors, and social events. The organization has hosted conferences since 1999. The organization also hosts service trips and retreats scheduled to coincide with typical undergraduate term breaks.  Founder  Curtis Martin is the founder and CEO of FOCUS. Martin holds a master's degree in Theology and is the author of the best-selling book Made for More, and co-host the EWTN show Crossing the Goal. In 2004, Curtis and his wife Michaelann were awarded the Benemerenti Medal by Pope John Paul II for their outstanding service to the Church. In 2011, Curtis Martin was appointed as Consulter to the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization by Pope Benedict XVI.The Denver Post - Pope calls Denver's Curtis Martin to serve on evangelization council Dr. Sri helped found the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS) with Curtis and Michaelann Martin in 1998.

In his own time, he was notorious as a flamboyant preacher against Puritan and sectarian dissent in the Church of England, and was remembered for the riot that accompanied the 1632 debut of his play The Rival Friends.Laurens Joseph Mills, Peter Hausted, Playwright, Poet, Preacher, Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1944. Beginnings Hausted was born at Oundle, in Northamptonshire. He earned an M.A. at Queens' College, Cambridge, and pursued a career in the Church of England. For a time he was the curate at Uppingham in Rutland.Theophilus Cibber, The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland, London, 1753; Bibliobazaar LLC, 2008; p. 307. Hausted participated in college theatricals as an actor; he was in the cast of the 1631 Cambridge production of Fucus Histriomastix, probably written by Queens' College's Robert Ward. Controversies The scandal over The Rival Friends involved a visit by Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria to Cambridge and the University in March 1632. As part of the entertainment, the University scheduled a performance of Hausted's The Rival Friends, a seven-hour-long play filled with anti-Puritan and anti-sectarian satire. In preparation for the event, the University authorities issued an edict, warning the student body not to indulge in \\"...any rude or immodest exclamations...nor any humming, hawking, whistling, hissing, or laughing...or any stamping or knocking, nor any such uncivil or unscholarlike or boyish behavior....\\" And above all, \\"no tobacco.\\"Andrew Gurr, Playgoing in Shakespeare's London, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1996; p. 54. The performance that ensued (and curiously, John Milton might have been in the audience)Barbara Lewalski, The Life of John Milton: A Critical Biography, Oxford, Blackwell, 2001; p. 43. was a theatrical disaster, a near riot in the faces of the King and Queen. Reacting to the disgrace, the University's vice-chancellor Henry Butts committed suicide by hanging himself on Easter Sunday, which was also April Fool's Day. When The Rival Friends was published later in the year, the title page stated that the play was \\"Cried down by boys, faction, envy, and confident ignorance, approv'd by the judicious, and now exposed to the public censure, by the author,\\" which gives a taste of Hausted's style. Hausted's troubles were not confined to the single incident of the 1632 riot. In 1634 he was attacked by a mob at the University church for preaching too wildly against the Puritans. Other works In addition to The Rival Friends, Hausted was the author of the Latin play Senile Odium, performed at the University in 1631 and printed in 1633. As a playwright, Hausted has been classed among the Sons of Ben, the followers of the comedic style of Ben Jonson. Like Jonson, Hausted has been noted for his indulgence in \\"self-praise and invective.\\"Michael Saenger, The Commodification of Textual Engagements in the English Renaissance, London, Ashgate Publishing, 2006; p. 64 n. 135. He was also a minor poet and translator; his translation of Raphael Thorius's Hymnus Tabaci, or \\"Hymn to Tobacco,\\" was published posthumously in 1651 (\\"Tobacco, King of Plants I well may call, / Others have single virtues, this hath all\\"). Hausted was a colleague of Thomas Randolph, another \\"Son of Ben\\" from Trinity College, Cambridge -- though the two were \\"rival friends\\" for a time, their conflict rooted in the controversy around Hausted's play. Randolph's The Jealous Lovers had been performed on the same day as The Rival Friends, and had been as great a success as Hausted's had been a failure. Eventually the two patched up their quarrel; Hausted wrote his colleague's epitaph after Randolph's death in 1635. Post mortem Hausted died on 20 July 1644, during the siege of Banbury Castle in the English Civil War. Early critics like Edmund Gosse reported that he died in combat, \\"shot on the ramparts;\\" more recent research indicates that he probably died of plague.Paul Elman, \\"The Death of Peter Hausted,\\" Notes and Queries 195 (1950), p. 16. A Satire Against Separatists, printed in 1675, has been variously attributed to Hausted and to Abraham Cowley.

The first helicopter flight in Germany took place on 26 June 1936 with a Focke-Wulf Fw 61. The Focke-Wulf Fw 61 was, however, an experimental helicopter and only two examples were ever built. Yet, Ernst Udet, head of the Reich Air Ministry development wing, having seen the demonstration flights, became a proponent of this relatively new type of aircraft. During World War II, several types were considered to be procured for the three different branches of the Wehrmacht. The German Army initially ordered 1,000 Flettner Fl 282 reconnaissance helicopters, however the production plant was destroyed and so only about 40 helicopters entered service. Another project, the more complex Focke Achgelis Fa 223 multi-role helicopter was beset with problems so that ultimately only 11 aircraft were delivered. The early years 1955 - 1960 Saro Skeeter With the foundation of the Bundeswehr in 1955, a decision was made that every branch of the Bundeswehr should have their own helicopter units, operating within the framework of the tasks designated to each branch of the armed forces. Thus, the German Army Aviation Corps was founded. Even before helicopters had been purchased by the German government, the first officers to become helicopter pilots in the newly formed German Army began their training in August 1956 in the United States at Fort Rucker. In September 1956, the German government purchased the following types of helicopters for the German Army Aviation Corps: * 11 Saunders-Roe Skeeter * 14 Bell 47G * 26 Sikorsky H-34 * 28 Vertol H-21 * 26 Sud-Ouest SO 1221 Djinn.

German Dornier Do 27, the only fixed-wing aircraft in service with German Army Aviation Corps On 7 November 1956, Colonel Horst Pape became the first head of Department German Army Aviation Corps within the General Staff, after having been responsible since 1954 for the planning and setting up of the German Army Aviation Corps. On 7 January 1957, the German Army Aviation Corps took over Mendig Air Base air base from the French Armed Forces. The first aircraft to be used was a Dornier Do 27. In March 1957, 130 conscripts started their basic training within units of the German Army Aviation Corps. During 1957, several new bases and squadrons were founded. Niedermendig, later renamed to Mendig, Fritzlar and Celle were the first bases with flying units. Alouette II On 9 March 1959, 130 SA318 Alouette II were bought. For more than 40 years, this helicopter was to be the training helicopter of the German Army Aviation Corps. The first German Army Aviation School (Heeresfliegerwaffenschule) was founded in Niedermendig on 1 July 1959. Its first commanding officer was Colonel Kuno Ebeling. On 12 January 1960, the instruction unit was transferred to former RAF B√ºckeburg, now B√ºckeburg Air Base, at Achum near B√ºckeburg. 1961 - 1990 During the disastrous North Sea flood of 1962, the German Army Aviation Corps came to the rescue of the population of Hamburg and its surroundings, rescuing countless people from drowning. 71 helicopters of the German Federal Army are engaged in rescue supported by 25 helicopters from the US ArmyGrandes catastrophes √† travers l'histoire, Parragon, p. 66, 2007, . On 1 April 1963, a teaching unit of the German Army Aviation Corps was established in Zweibr√ºcken. In 1967, this unit, too, was ultimately transferred to B√ºckeburg. On 20 August 1963, the first Bell UH-1D was delivered to training units. On 1 April 1968, Brigadier-General Kurt Kauffmann became the first General of the German Army Aviation Corps. On 9 June 1971, the helicopter museum of the German Army Aviation Corps in B√ºckeburg opened for the public. On 26 July 1971, replacement of the Sikorsky H-34 with Sikorsky CH-53G began. In 1975, the German Army Aviation Corps received its first flight simulator for the Bell 47G. The purpose of the simulator was not only to train crews for standard situations but also for SAR situations. During a spread of wildfires in Germany in 1975 and 1976, helicopters of the German Army Aviation Corps contributed to the extinguishing of the fires. During these tasks, the device Smokey for fighting large-scale fires was developed. In January 1976, German Army Aviation Corps came to the rescue of the population of Cuxhaven and the Haseldorf Marshes, affected by severe flooding. On 8 May 1978, the first MBB Bo 105P, designed as an anti- tank helicopter, was delivered into service units. Consequently, three regiments equipped with this helicopter were established at Celle Air Base, Roth Air Base and Fritzlar Air Base. In August 1980, devastating wildfires on Mount Athos in Greece, threatening century-old monasteries, were fought with the aid of German Army Aviation Corps, using their device Smokey. Post 1990 Mil Mi-8 LTH NATO-HELICOPTER 90 Kurdish refugee children run toward a CH-53G helicopter of the German Army Aviation Corps in Northern Iraq in 1991 A CH-53G helicopter of the German Army Aviation Corps near Sarajevo in 1999 Eurocopter EC 135 PAH-2 Tiger UHT Following the German reunification (3 October 1990), 3rd and 5th wing of the East German Airforce, part of the National People's Army (NVA), became 70th, 80th and East Squadron of the German Army Aviation Corps. During a transitional period, German Army Aviation Corps flew Soviet-built Mil Mi-8 helicopters. The Mil Mi-24 fleet, however, was no longer used and subsequently sold off. In 1991, German Army Aviation Corps helicopters provided humanitarian aid to Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq. From October 1991 onwards, Sikorsky CH-53G of the German Army Aviation Corps provided the means of transport for UN weapons inspectors in Iraq. In 1993 and 1994, in Somalia, Bell UH-1D helicopters equipped with machine-guns were used for the first time in earnest as a means for self-protection. On 1 April 1994, the German Army Aviation Corps Brigade 10 was established. This brigade united all German Army Aviation Corps transport helicopter units under one leadership. The reconnaissance and liaison units were also integrated into this brigade. In December 1995, German Army Aviation Corps became part of IFOR contingent, later to be renamed SFOR, in the former Yugoslavia, flying missions into the most remote mountainous regions. In 2004, NATO handed over the command of SFOR to the EU. The name of the mission changed then to EUFOR. During civil unrest in Albania in March 1997, the German Army Aviation Corps flew several missions into Albania in order to evacuate foreign citizens. On 3 April 1997, a new brigade was established, Air-Motorised Brigade 1, combining several German Army Aviation Corps forces into one unit, in order to create more rapidity in response, flexibility and fighting power. During flooding in July and August 1997, the dikes along the river Oder in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern were on the verge of collapsing. The German Army Aviation Corps flew numerous mission in order to save the dikes and the population. In February 1999, following a devastating avalanche in Galt√ºr in Austria, ten helicopters of the German Army Aviation Corps took part in evacuation missions as part of the international aid effort. In March 1999, German Army Aviation Corps' mission in Kosovo began when the first base was established in Macedonia. The helicopters were part of KFOR. Later that year, the unit was transferred to Kosovo proper. On 9 September 1999, the new helicopter LTH NATO-Helicopter 90 was presented to the public at the German Army Aviation School in B√ºckeburg. Delivery to active units is planned to be taking place from the second half of 2006 onwards, after the manufacturer, NH Industries, encountered several problems causing a delay in production. On 13 September 1999, the first Eurocopter EC 135 was brought into action as a training helicopter, eventually to supersede the Alouette II. The last flight of a German Army Aviation Corps' Alouette II took place early in 2006. On 14 December 1999, an improved version of the CH-53G, the CH-53GS, was introduced, easily recognisable because of their large pair of auxiliary fuel tanks. During the flooding of the river Elbe in 2002, the German Army Aviation Corps flew countless missions in order to rescue people, strengthening the crumbling dikes and flying in supplies into areas cut off by the high waters. Beginning with the transfer of four helicopters to Kabul in Afghanistan in April 2002, the German Army Aviation Corps' mission as part of ISAF started, the units either being based in Afghanistan proper or in neighbouring Uzbekistan at the air base of Termez. In November 2007 the helicopters moved their base to Mazari Sharif. Towards then end of 2003, the first Eurocopter Tiger helicopters were delivered for testing and evaluation purposes to the German Army's Office of Defense Technology and Procurement. In 2005, Eurocopter Tigers were delivered to the Franco-German Training Centre in Le Luc where the initial pilot training scheme takes place. Delivery to combat units is expected to take place in the second half of 2006. German Army Aviation Corps Attack Helicopter Regiment 26 Franken based in Roth Air Base is to be equipped with the Eurocopter Tiger as well as German Army Aviation Corps Attack Helicopter Regiment 36 based in Fritzlar. During yet another flooding of the river Elbe in April 2006, the German Army Aviation Corps again contributed to the aid of the population by flying numerous SAR missions. Helicopters of the German Army Aviation Corps were part of EUFOR RD Congo in support of UN mission MONUC to monitor the general elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This mission lasted from June 2006 and ended with the last soldiers returning in December of the same year. In August 2007 helicopters of the German Army Aviation Corps were part of the international force assisting the Greek authorities in fighting the catastrophic forest fires on the Peloponnese.Firehouse.com, Associated Press, 2007-08-27 In October 2011 the German Federal Ministry of Defence announced a reorganisation/reduction of the German Armed Forces. As a consequence, the strength of Germany Army Aviation Corps will be reduced. Flying and training operations at Altenstadt, Rheine Air Base, Celle Air Base and Roth Air Base will cease to exist and the respective army aviation units stationed at these air bases disbanded.Quoted from , PDF-file \\"Die Stationierung der Bundeswehr in Deutschland\\", passim Medium Transport Helicopter Regiment 25, based at Laupheim Air Base disbanded on 31 December 2012 and was re-established as Helicopter Wing 64 of the German Air Force on 1 January 2013.

He also supported Turkish nationalism against its Ottoman counterpart as well as laicism against theocracy.Bozkurt G√ºven√ß, T√ºrk Kimliƒüi, K√ºlt√ºr Bakanlƒ±ƒüƒ±, 1993, p. 32. Frash√´ri was one of the sons of an impoverished Bey from Frash√´r (Fra≈üer during the Ottoman rule) in the District of P√´rmet. He gained a place in Ottoman literature as a talented author under the name of ≈ûemseddin Sami Efendi and contributed to the Ottoman Turkish language reforms. Frash√´ri's message, however as declared in his book \\"Albania - What it was, what it is, and what will become of it\\" published in 1899, became the manifesto of the Rilindja Komb√´tare. He discussed the prospects for a united, free and independent republic of Albania. In this way, beginning with a demand for autonomy and struggle for their own alphabet and education, Frash√´ri helped the Albanian National Movement develop its claim for independence. His lifetime goal, as that of many other members of the Albanian renaissance was the development and improvement of Albania's culture and eventual establishment of an independent country. Life Museum house of the Frash√´ri Brothers in Frash√´r, P√´rmet, Albania Sami Frash√´ri was born in 1850 in the village of Frash√´r in the Vilayet of Janina to a distinguished Muslim Albanian family of Bektashi religious affiliations. Sami, alongside his brothers Naim, Abdyl and 5 other siblings were the children of Halit Bey (1797‚Äì1859) and their paternal family traditions held that they were descendants of timar holders that hailed from the Berat region before coming to live in Frash√´r. While their mother Emine Hanƒ±m (1814‚Äì1861) was descended from Imrahor Ilyas Bey, a distinguished 15th century Ottoman Albanian commander from the Kor√ß√´ area. Sami began his studies at the Bektashi tekke in Frash√´r. Halit Bey and Emine died in 1859 and 1861 respectively. His older brother Abdul became head of the household and moved the whole family to Yanina. There Sami attended the Greek language Zosimea high school. During that time he came in touch with western philosophy and studied Latin, ancient and modern Greek, French and Italian. He also attended a local Muslim school and learned through lessons from teachers Turkish, Arabic, and Persian. Frash√´ri was a bright student and finished an eight-year schooling program by graduating at the end of seven years. His reflections of the Zosimea later in life was that it was \\"the perfect high school\\". Having received a broad education in a diverse socio-cultural and religious environment at the Zosimea and through private tutors, he gained the linguistic tools to emotionally and intellectually travel between cultures during his lifetime. In 1872 Sami and his brother Naim migrated to Istanbul and both got a job working for the Ottoman bureaucracy and as he admired French culture became involved in translating French language novels such as Les Mis√©rables into Ottoman Turkish, later writing some short stories, plays and novels of his own. He was briefly posted in Tripoli, Libya and in 1874 returned to Istanbul becoming a writer for a newspaper. Later in 1877 he went on another short assignment being posted briefly at Rhodes. Returning to Istanbul he remained in the capital for the remainder of his life. Frash√´ri emerged as an accomplished Ottoman-Albanian intellectual with a reputation of having an inquisitive and sharp intellect. He assisted in founding and serving as chief editor for several journals and newspapers. In Ottoman Turkish he wrote more than a dozen books like Insan (Human Being), Medeniyet-i Islamiye (Islamic Civilisation) and Kadƒ±nlar (Women). He compiled a French-Turkish (1882) and Turkish-French (1884) dictionary, an Arabic language dictionary (1898) and a two volume Ottoman Turkish dictionary (1899-1901) along with a six volume encyclopedia Kamus al Alam (1899-1899). Additionally Frash√´ri authored other publications in the Albanian language that included a pamphlet on the alphabet question, a reader, a grammar and a political treatise on the Albanian question titled Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be. = Involvement in the Albanian national movement =  The Besa yahut Ahde Vefa play  In Istanbul 1874 Frash√´ri wrote a play named Bes√¢ y√¢hut √Çhde Vef√¢ (Pledge of Honour or Loyalty to an Oath) in the Albanian language with themes based on an Albanian ethnicity, a bond to an ethnic based territory, ethno-cultural diversity as underlying Ottoman unity, honour, loyalty and self-sacrifice. The play revolved around a betrothed girl kidnapped by a jealous villager that kills her father and whose mother vows revenge co-opting the culprit's father who gives his besa (pledge of honour) to help not knowing its his son, later killing him and himself ending with family reconciliation. Frash√´ri's reasons for the play were to inform people about the morals, values, customs and traditions of Albanians whom he considered an important part of the empire and to create more local Ottoman theatre which he felt was dominated by foreign influences. The play was intended to present Albanians in a positive light to Ottoman and Albanian audiences that involved mainly Armenians directing and acting in roles with smaller numbers of Turks during its stage run. His play and its discussion of besa signified to more astute audiences the political implications of the concept and possible subversive connotations in future usage while it assisted Albanians in rallying militarily and politically around a national program. By 1901 his play was translated into Albanian by close friend Abdul Ypi and published in Sofia by Kristo Luarasi while it was part of the curriculum of the Albanian school in Kor√ß√´ until its closure in 1902. The themes of the play highlighting a besa for the self-sacrifice of the homeland carried a subversive message for Albanians to aim at unifying the nation and defending the homeland, something Ottoman authorities also saw as fostering nationalist sentiments. The Ottoman government placed the Albanian language version of the play on a list of books it deemed that \\"incite national sentiments of the Albanians\\" and during the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 there were reports of Albanian guerillas acting out scenes around campfires. Frash√´ri's play would not appear in theatres until the aftermath of the 1908 Young Turk Revolution when performances continued for a full three years and during 1911-1912.  League of Prizren period  During the Great Eastern Crisis, the Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights was founded in 1877 and headed by elder brother Abdyl with Sami, Hasan Tahsini, Pashko Vasa and Jani Vreto being members. The Committee aimed at the territorial unity and integrity of Albanian inhabited land within the Ottoman Empire with its members sending protests and visiting European embassies while urging Albanians in the Balkans to resist partition. Early in 1879, this committee formed a commission for the Albanian alphabet. The Committee appointed Sami along with Tahsini, Vasa and Vreto to create an Albanian alphabet. During discussions about the Albanian alphabet Frash√´ri and Vreto wanted the inclusion of a Greek alphabet character on the premise that Albanians and Greeks have the same ancestors, the Pelasgians.Michael Kreutz. Modernismus und Europaidee in der √ñstlichen Mittelmeerwelt, 1821-1939. p. 166. \\"Der bekannte intellektuelle Vordenker Sami Frash√´ri setzte sich wie Jan Vreto (Ioannis Vretos) f√ºr das Griechisch e ein, mit der Begr√ºndung, dass Albaner wie Griechen beidermassen Abk√∂mmlinge der Pelasger seien.\\" Frash√´ri created a new Albanian alphabet based on the Latin script and a one letter, one sound principle that contained certain Greek letters and others invented by him for sounds that a Latin alphabet was unable to convey. By 19 March 1879 the Society for Albanian Writings adopted Frash√´ri's 36 letter Istanbul alphabet consisting mostly of Latin characters that resulted in the publication of Albanian books and toward the late nineteenth century his alphabet had spread among Albanians. On 20 June 1878 Sami was one of ten signatories to a memorandum addressed to Berlin Congress hosts chancellor Bismarck and Count Andrassy calling for reforms and Albanians to remain in the Ottoman state with their rights, desires, interests and traditions being respected. Amidst this time Frash√´ri worked for the Ottoman newspaper Terc√ºman-ƒ± Hakikat and he reported coverage on the geopolitical situation and events in Albania. In an article published on 24 December 1878 about the Albanian question, he expressed that Albania was his special vatan (homeland) and he felt connected to the wider Ottoman motherland stressing that Albanians were loyal to the empire and ready to defend it. He referred to two threats facing Albanians, one military due to irredentist claims of neighbouring powers on Albanian inhabited land and the other was cultural where Slavs and Greeks had established schools that used their languages in Albanian areas. The solution for him was the unification of Albania into one vilayet (province) that could establish an effective resistance force. Frash√´ri continued to write a series of articles expanding his views by maintaining that Albanians wished to read and write in their language and those abilities he thought would allow Albanians protection from the influences of Hellenism and Slavism. By 2 January 1879 he developed his thoughts further and stressed that the Ottoman constitution of 1876 guaranteed this right to all peoples of the empire to read and write in ones native language. Frash√´ri viewed the plight of his fellow Albanians as based upon poverty and ignorance that disadvantaged them when it came to dealing with Hellenism and Slavism. He considered those factors as placing Albanians at risk of being severed from the empire for the benefits of foreign powers and peoples with Frash√´ri stating that both Christian and Muslim Albanians were thinking alike on these issues. Frash√´ri also founded and headed in Istanbul the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings in October 1879, where Albanian scholastic books and texts were compiled by him and his brother Naim. He expressed that the Society had difficulties in its work due to a lack of \\"liberty\\" in the empire and for Frash√´ri the aims of the organisation went further then publishing books but to revive the Albanian language and unify its dialects. In a correspondence of 1881 with Girolamo De Rada regarding the Albanian question Frash√´ri expressed sentiments supporting Albanian unity that transcended Muslim and Christian divisions with religion being separate from the state. By 1884 he had developed a reputation for championing the Albanian cause. The Society for Albanian Writings was forced to close by the Ottoman Government in 1885. In 1885, Frash√´ri managed to get permission from the Ottoman sultan for the opening of an Albanian boys school in Kor√ß√´. On 7 March 1887 it opened in Kor√ß√´ with some two hundred enrolled students of Muslim and Christian faiths and due to a lack of education material Sami, his brother Naim and several other Albanians wrote textbooks in Albanian for the school. In 1896 he made an assessment of education in the Vilayet of Monastir claiming that Greeks, Bulgarians and Aromanians had more progressive schools and advanced education than Muslim Albanians. = Between Ottomanism, Albanianism and Turkism =  The Kamus al-A'lam encyclopedia  Between 1889 and 1899 Frash√´ri wrote a six volume encyclopedia Kamus al-A'lam written in Ottoman Turkish and was a scientific work of 4,380 pages. He sought to provide information about the Islamic world on famous individuals, geography and countries, demography, history, cultures from around world and other topics that he felt was minimally covered in Western publications. The encyclopedia had a focus on Turks, Arabs and in particular the Ottomans with Frash√´ri including detailed information for his readers on topics about Albania and Albanians. For example, one entry titled Arnavud (Albanian) was six pages and a total of eleven columns. The detailed article presented Albanians as an ancient Balkan people, older than Greeks and Latins that preserved in the mountains their customs such as the besa, traditions, language and an identity. The assertion aimed to present Albanians as legitimate members of the community of nations during an era of nationalism. Frash√´ri included information on the Venetian period, Ottoman conquest, conversion to Islam, attainment of Ottoman privileges and highlighting sacrifice and service to the state as soldiers, bureaucrats, in commerce and industry by Albanians. Skanderbeg, a fifteenth century warrior and his revolt against the Ottomans were described in a positive light as were the national and intellectual achievements of the Albanian diaspora in southern Italy. Despite regional differences of Ghegs and Tosks, Frash√´ri emphasized the unity of Albanians as speaking the same language with small dialectal differences. He stressed the importance of developing Albanian language education and literature as a way of resisting encroachment from others through for example Hellenisation and as such urged authorities to allow Albanian national development. As with other entries on cities, towns, administrative units and others on Albanian topics Frash√´ri overall aimed in his encyclopedia to educate the general public about Albanians, to raise Albanian self-awareness and outline the geographical boundaries of Albania. The concept of Albanianism was also subtly developed within his encyclopedia. Sami Frash√´ri, circa early 20th century In comparison, the article T√ºrk was three pages and five columns which underfeatured the importance and role of Turks in the empire when compared to Albanians. Tracing their history Frash√´ri described the Turks \\"as among Asia's biggest and most famous nations\\" numbering ten million and the Ottoman Empire as a \\"Turkish state\\". Apart from the prominence of Turks and Turkish culture, Frash√´ri stressed the ethnic and cultural diversity of the Ottoman Empire in his encyclopedia. That theme was embodied in the entry Ottoman a term Frash√´ri presented as originating from a great Turkish tribe with a change in meaning over time encompassing all Ottoman peoples and subjects, due to the Tanzimat reforms guided by a principle of equality. After being involved with the Albanian movement during the League of Prizren period Frash√´ri increasingly came under suspicion by the Ottoman government over a number of times. In an investigation of 1890 into Frash√´ri by authorities, an acquaintance said that he and his brothers worked for eventual Albanian independence by first aiming to unite the Albanian inhabited vilayets into a unitary province within the empire. Ottoman authorities did not act against him and he published a further four volumes of his encyclopedia with the last being in 1899 while continuing with public and private discourses on Albania and Albanians. In 1896, the authors of the Ottoman government provincial almanac for Kosovo titled Kosova Salnamesi credited Frash√´ri and his encyclopedia as the source for most of their information. By 1899, a successor organisation to the Prizren League called League of Peja (Besa-Bes√´) had arisen and Frash√´ri again attempted to raise public discussion on Albania. He organised an Albanian Committee in Istanbul that supported lower taxes and use of Albanian in government schools in the region. These events saw his position with the state change rapidly and according to recollections by his children in later years a palace official had visited Frash√´ri at his home and restricted his movements while he was still employed by the government until his death.  Political Treatise: Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be  In March 1899, Frash√´ri secretly completed an important booklet Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be which outlined his geopolitical ideas on the Albanian question. The booklet was smuggled out of the Ottoman Empire and published in Bucharest with the identity of the author not appearing in the publication. Publishers from Austro-Hungary printed some of Frash√´ri's most important works containing nationalist themes with Austro-Hungarian Albanologists Theodor Anton Ippen and Baron Nopcsa financing the translation and distribution of his publications. After several months passed from his death the identity of Frash√´ri as author was revealed on 17 November 1904 by Shahin Kolonja who had published the work and later by a German translation of the booklet in 1913. As in previous publications he repeated certain points such as claiming Albanians as the oldest peoples of Europe, focused on Skanderbeg in a few pages, the Ottoman era in Albania and Albanian contribution to the empire. The second section of the booklet was concentrated on Albania of his time. Frash√´ri discussed the borders of Albania and Albanian unity despite the Gheg-Tosk subgroups and differences of religion in society. He lamented the lack of progress spanning over twenty years toward developing the Albanian language and the opening of Albanian schools within the Ottoman Empire. Declaring \\"I am an Albanian\\", his work derided identification of Muslim Albanians with Turks and Orthodox Albanians as Rums while he opposed attempts by Greeks to hellenise them and seeking to incorporate Tosk√´ria at a future date into Greece. He believed that Albania and the empire could no longer coexist in the same unit, even if there was a new period of prosperity due to a history of Ottoman prohibition on the development of an national Albanian identity and language. Frash√´ri worried that Albania would not be able to preserve its nationality because of restrictions on Albanian schooling while at the same time the Porte was allowing rival national movements to act as they pleased, and that this would ultimately lead to the partition of Albania - hence, Albanians had to take matters into their own hands for self- preservation. He preferred Albanian political unity and recognition of Albanian rights achieved by European powers exerting pressure on the empire than an anti-Ottoman revolt, as he thought the empire was on borrowed time and Albanians would need to prepare for creating an independent state. Frash√´ri proposed that Albanians make a besa to demand the empire and Europe recognize Albanian national rights, especially by applying pressure upon the Ottomans to achieve those aims. He envisioned an autonomous Albanian state with a political parliamentary system, a capital called Skenderbey to be located in central Albania, an Albanian school system, two universities with one each in the north and south and an army of 20,000 men. The nationalisation of the various faiths and sects was envisioned where Catholics would have their own archbishop, Muslims their mufti, Orthodox their Exarch, Bektashi their chief Baba with Jews and Protestants also worshiping in freedom. The booklet by Frash√´ri overall was an articulation of political Albanianism.  Contributions to Turkism  Frash√´ri was a significant contributor to the development of Turkism. From the early 1880s he had an interest in the imperial Ottoman language as expressed in an article \\"The Ottoman Turkish Language\\" on 2 November 1881 where Frash√´ri argued that it was a Turkish language. These views would appear in articles published during the 1890s where he advocated for the imperial Ottoman language to be simplified and replaced by spoken Turkish, with words and grammatical structures stemming from Arabic and Persian being removed. Frash√´ri envisaged the emergence of a modern colloquial Turkish language from a disintegration of the imperial Ottoman language that would have benefit wider society. Frash√´ri published an Ottoman Turkish dictionary Kamus i T√ºrki and in its first two volumes in 1899 he expressed in an introduction that Western Turkish or Ottoman was the same language as its Eastern Turkish counterpart or Cagatay. The differences for him was that Western Turkish had absorbed Persian, Arabic, Italian and Greek words which Frash√´ri thought was unnecessary. For him the dictionary was the wealth of a language and as other languages possessed their dictionaries Frash√´ri viewed Turkish as in need of its own dictionary to preserve unique linguistic attributes. Embracing Turkish as \\"our language\\", Frash√´ri stuck to his Albanian heritage by affirming an Albanian identity and commitment to Albanianism in the dictionary. In word entries on Albania and Albanians he included definitions on being Albanian such as the term Albanianism where an example of its use in an sentence was rendered as \\"He is not denying his Albanianism/Albanianess\\" (Arnavudluƒüunu inkur etmiyor). Sami Frash√´ri and his wife Emine, May 1884. The choice of wording by Frash√´ri in labeling the language Turkish as opposed to Ottoman assisted to nurture a national identity among Turkish people. For him his idea of the Ottoman Empire was for Abdul Hamid II to emphasize Ottomanism over Islamism and incorporate concepts like Turkism and Albanianism into the state framework allowing cultural pluralism with Albanians and Turks each developing their own languages and teaching them in schools. He considered cultural and ethnic diversity of the Muslim community as factors that would strengthen Ottoman unity. Frash√´ri, after several years of work published a 500-page Arabic dictionary (Kamus-i Arabi) in 1896 and he also noted that Kurdish lacked a dictionary but was unable to compile it as he lacked linguistic skills in the language. Stories of him working on an Albanian dictionary existed during his lifetime. He failed however to produce one and George Gawrych holds that probably due to the work of his friend Konstantin Kristoforidhi whose Albanian dictionary was published in 1904 he choose to let it be the standard version. Sami Frash√´ri also played a role in the later developing Turkish nationalist movement, by translating the works of European Turkology into Turkish and transmitting their Western ideas to Turk audiences. These works would serve as a basis for an emerging Turkish identity, and the early Turkish nationalists were grateful for them. He had close relationships with Turkish nationalist intellectuals Veled √áelebi (ƒ∞zbudak) and Necip Asƒ±m (Yazƒ±ksƒ±z) and maintained friendships with the writers and publisher of the journal ƒ∞kdam which contributed to the spread of cultural Turkism and promotion of nationalism within Turkey.  Legacy  Frash√´ri died on 18 June 1904 aged fifty four after a severe illness at his home in Erenk√∂y, Istanbul. He left a number of unpublished manuscripts relating to Turkish studies. Due to his envedours and work within that field it has earned him a place within Ottoman intellectual history. During his lifetime Frash√´ri admired European culture and its intellectual achievements while he sought respect and dignity for his Albanian background being himself loyal to the Ottoman Empire. As an Ottoman, like many other Albanians he negotiated the daily reality of the multi-ethnic, linguistic and religious realities of his time appreciating and supporting the diversity of the state while also advocating for Albanianism. He was devoted to both vatans (homelands), the wider Ottoman and his special Albanian one. Frash√´ri moved socially and intellectually through various communities of Istanbul while having an appreciation of Islam and traditions originating from Arabs and the Ottoman sociopolitical and cultural systems. Along with other Albanians, Albanianism with Ottomanism were seen as being compatible. As a cultural and political activist Frash√´ri however ran into trouble with the Ottoman government. Over time he developed a disillusionment with the regime of sultan Abdul Hamid II and increasingly turned to Albanianism. Being an Albanian Tosk he felt frustration with his fellow Albanian Ghegs and other conservative and traditionalist Albanians whom he thought were more preoccupied with regional and local matters than with the national issues. Frash√´ri did not want Albanians to be confused for Turks and he worked to foster the national identities of both ethnic groups. At times tensions existed for him when the categories of Ottomanism and Albanianism and of Turk and Albanian were not in balance. As scholar Francis Trix put it he was \\"an Ottoman reformer [who] could be both an Albanian patriot and, at the same time, a cultural Turk of the highest order\\".

Among Turkish circles, the Young Turk newspaper Osmanlƒ± published in Geneva described him in their full front-page obituary as a scholar and great humanritarian that \\"honored Ottomanism (Osmanlƒ±lƒ±k).\\" Yusuf Ak√ßura, an advocate of Turkism and contemporary of Frash√´ri considered him as a Turkish nationalist. Albanians of the era regarded Frash√´ri as a patriot, while due to his contributions toward developing a national Albanian literature modern Albanian historians view him as an Albanian nationalist. As the works of Frash√´ri contain nationalistic discourse, following his death they have retained the attention of the public during different time periods and governments in Albania and Turkey. Within Turkish literary history Frash√´ri is revered as being a forefather of Turkish literature and a significant innovator for the Turkish language. In Albanian collective memory he is cherished as a founding father of Albanian literature and as one of the rilindjas (national awakeners) of the Albanian nation. An Ottoman historian Kemal Karpat summed up his complex identity as \\"Sami considered himself a 'Turk' because he was a member of the Ottoman state, and he saw no conflict between his Ottoman political identity and his Albanian ethnicity.\\" The four surviving children of Frash√´ri remained in Turkey and due to their commitment to the republic Turkish authorities decided in the 1950s not to allow the remains of Sami to leave the country for Albania. His son, Ali Sami Yen (1886‚Äì1951), was a footballer and founder of Galatasaray SK and chairman of Galatasaray between 1905‚Äì18 and 1925‚Äì6. Nowadays, a lot of schools bear his name, i.e. Sami Frash√´ri High School is one of the most well-known gymnasium in Prishtina and another in Tirana, and in other localities like Bogovinje, North Macedonia and so on. The Frash√´ri brothers have been commemorated in Albanian folk songs. Work Sami is the author of around 50 works. Some of his most important writings are: =Novels= * Ta'a≈ü≈ü√ªk-ƒ± Tal'at ve Fitn√¢t (Albanian: Dashuria e Talatit me Fitneten -English: The Love Between Talat and Fitnat, 1873) The story carries a sentimental subject of love between Talat and Fitnat. Generally, the novel consists of a combination of Oriental and Western writing styles. Also, this novel is commonly mistaken to be the first novel written in Turkish.In reality, the first novel written entirely in Turkish was Akabi's Story by Vartan Pa≈üa, an Armenian Ottoman Pasha in the year 1851 =Drama= * Bes√¢ y√¢hut √Çhde Vef√¢ (Albanian: \\"Besa ose Mbajtja e Fjal√´s\\" - English: Besa or The Given Word of Trust, 1874).

He also published a small compilation of Humor named Let√¢'if in two volumes, a compilation of Proverbs and Quotes named Ems√¢l in four volumes, and a series of reading-oriented educational books for schoolchildren. During Eb√ºzziya Tevfiks exile, Frash√´ri managed the Ottoman journal Muharrir. =Language studies and linguistics= * Us√ªl-√º Tenk√Æd ve Tert√Æb (1886, Orthography of Turkish) * Nev-us√ªl Sarf-ƒ± T√ºrk√Æ (1891, Modern Turkish Grammar) * Ye√±i Us√ªl-√º Elifb√¢-yƒ± T√ºrk√Æ (1898, New Turkish Alphabetical System) * Us√ªl-√º Ced√Æd-i Kav√¢'id-i 'Arabiyye (1910, New Method for Learning Arabic) * Tatb√Æk√¢t-ƒ± 'Arabiyye (1911, Exercises in Arabic) =Political work= * Shqip√´ria √ß'ka qen√´, √ß'√´sht√´ e √ßdo t√´ b√´het√´ (Albania - what it was, what it is and what it will be, 1899). **Theoretical commentary that became Rilindja Komb√´tare's manifesto.

Lang also performed \\"Tom, Dick or Harry\\" (as Lucentio) with Edwin Clay (as Gremio), Charles Wood (as Hortensio) and Lisa Kirk (as Bianca). Although he appeared on television in the early 1950s, Lang made no commercial films. It was reported 20th Century- Fox wanted him for the role of Vera-Ellen‚Äôs boyfriend Mike in Three Little Girls in Blue (1946) but he had to refuse because of stage commitments. A great loss because he would have introduced the now-classic song \\"You Make Me Feel So Young.\\" His replacement was non-singer/dancer, minor-player Charles Smith (actor). The New York Public Library has archival films of Lang's work in Fancy Free and Interplay.

Born in rural Knox County, Illinois, Copley's family moved to Aurora when Copley was two so that he could be treated for scarlet fever. After graduating from Yale College and the Union College of Law, Copley assumed management of the Aurora Gas Light Company. He successfully guided the company into a regional utilities giant, eventually merging his assets into the Western Utility Corporation, which he sold in 1926. Copley purchased his first newspaper in 1905, eventually amassing over two dozen papers as Copley Press. He was a Republican and was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1911, where he served until 1923. From 1915 to 1917, he represented his district as a Progressive. Copley was defeated in a primary in 1922. He is the namesake of Rush‚ÄìCopley Medical Center. His adopted sons James S. and William went on to notable careers in business and art, respectively. Biography Ira Clifton Copley was born on October 25, 1864, in Copley Township, Knox County, Illinois, south of Altona. He was the son of Ellen Madeleine (n√©e Whiting) and farmer Ira Birdsall Copley, for whom the township was named. At the age of two, Copley contracted scarlet fever, prompting his family to move east to Aurora, Illinois to see an eye specialist. Copley regained his sight around the age of six, though he struggled with vision problems for the rest of his life. In the meantime, his father became a prominent Aurora citizen, managing the Aurora Gas Light Company. Copley graduated from high school in 1881, then attended the Francis Jennings Seminary. Graduating in 1883, he then matriculated at Yale College, where he graduated in 1887. He then studied law for two years at the Union College of Law, but dropped out before graduating. By this time, his father's gas company was struggling. Although he had recently been admitted to the bar in Illinois, Copley decided to return to Aurora to assume management. Copley shifted the focus of the company from illumination to selling gas as a fuel. The company saw great success and Copley used the profits to purchase competing gas companies. In 1905, he merged his companies into the Western United Gas & Electric Company. Copley would continue to expand the operation for the next twenty years. In 1914, he organized a coal and coke company, then consolidated the two organizations in the Western Utility Corporation in 1921. He sold his interest in the company to investment firms Rollins & Sons and Fitkin & Co. in 1926. At the same time as his rising success as an industrialist, Copley took an interest in publishing. He purchased the Aurora Beacon in 1905 and later purchased papers in Elgin and Joliet. After selling the Western Utility Corporation, Copley purchased twenty-four newspapers in Southern California for $7.5 million. He managed these publishing holdings as Copley Press, Inc. and was its first president, serving until 1942. He integrated his Illinois publishing interests into the company in 1939. Copley focused on cities that had only one publisher, with the exception his San Diego, California, holdings purchased from the estate of John D. Spreckels. Unlike his contemporaries, Copley took little interest in the politics of his papers and insisted that local managers write impartially. Copley enlisted as a private, Company \\"B\\" 3rd Regiment in the Illinois National Guard in 1880. He was promoted to captain of Company \\"I\\" in 1893, then the next year was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel & Inspector of Rifle Practice for the full brigade. He served in this capacity until 1899. Despite political independence in his papers, Copley led an active political life. In 1894, he was named a member of the Illinois Republican State Central Committee, the state Republican Party organization, where he served for four years. He was the organization's Chairman of the Finance Committee for two of those years. He was also elected President of the Illinois League of Republican Clubs in 1896, declining re-election in 1898. He was appointed to the Illinois Park Commission in 1894, serving four years. Copley was an aide, also known as an Illinois Colonel, to Governor Charles S. Deneen during his eight-year term starting in 1905. Copley was tasked with constructing a new Illinois State Penitentiary in 1909, which he oversaw until 1926. Jarvis Hunt designed Copley's 1917 mansion in Aurora, now on the National Register of Historic Places In 1910, he campaigned for Howard M. Snapp's former seat in Illinois's 11th congressional district of the United States House of Representatives. He successfully defeated his Democratic opponent. He was re-elected two years later. In 1914, Copley aligned with Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive (Bull Moose) Party and was one of five Representatives elected from the party. With the party disintegrating by the end of his term, Copley, returned to the Republican Party in 1916. He represented his district until 1922, when he was defeated in a primary election by Frank R. Reid. His uncle Richard H. Whiting had also served in the House of Representatives (1875‚Äì1877). Copley continued his publishing aspirations after leaving Congress, purchasing Springfield's Illinois State Journal in 1927, favoring its pro-Republican stance. Copley attempted to buy the Illinois State Register, the Journal's Democratic- oriented competitor, at the same time. That effort failed, and the two newspapers engaged in nearly 15 years of circulation battles, with the Register focused on city circulation and the Journal seeking subscribers throughout the Springfield area. In 1942, however, Copley tried again to buy the Register. This time, he was successful, although he also promised that the Register could keep its independent editorial voice.The Thin Gold Watch, by Walter S.J. Swanson (2nd ed.), Copley Press, 1970 The two papers were merged in 1974 into The State Journal-Register. (The SJ-R, now owned by GateHouse Media, is still the major newspaper in Springfield.) In 1928, Copley consolidated the San Diego Union and San Diego Tribune into The San Diego Union-Tribune. Later that year, Senator George W. Norris accused Copley Press of receiving money from public utility companies, but Copley successfully defended his position before the Federal Trade Commission in 1929. =Personal life= Copley married Edith Straker in March 1892. They adopted two sons: James Strohn, who became president of Copley Press in 1947, and William Nelson, who became a prominent artist. Edith died in 1929; in 1931, Copley married Chloe (n√©e Warley) Davidson. He was named to the board of directors of the Aurora Public Library in 1890. From 1892 to 1897, he served on the board of trustees of the Jennings Seminary. He joined Freemasonry in 1889 and the Knights of Pythias in 1890. In his free time, he enjoyed traveling. Copley donated over $2 million to the Aurora City Hospital in 1937 to fund a new campus; originally dedicated as Copley Memorial Hospital, it is now known as the Rush‚ÄìCopley Medical Center. Copley died on November 1, 1947, and was buried in Spring Lake Cemetery in Aurora. Bishop William W. Horstick proceeded over the service. Copley still managed seventeen newspapers at the time of his death. His former residence in Aurora, the Col. Ira C. Copley Mansion, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Located on the grounds are the Morven Park Mansion, the Winmill Carriage Museum, formal boxwood gardens, miles of hiking and riding trails, and athletic fields. The park is also home to the Museum of Hounds and Hunting of North America with displays of art, artifacts and memorabilia about the sport of foxhunting. The Mansion, once the home of Thomas Swann, Jr., governor of Maryland during the Civil War and Westmoreland Davis, governor of Virginia during World War I, is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a Virginia Historic Landmark. The Westmoreland Davis Memorial Foundation operates Morven Park, which is a 501c3 nonprofit organization supported by contributions from donors. The world-renowned Morven Park International Equestrian Center hosts Olympic equestrians and top-level riders from around the world who come to compete in Horse Trials, Dressage, Hunter/Jumper shows, Pony Club and Carriage Driving events. From 1980 until 2010, Morven Park was the site of the Morven Park Steeplechase Races, one of the most popular race meets in the country. History The first structures on the site of Morven Park date to about 1780. A fieldstone house built by Wilson Cary Seldon is now a part of the north wing of the main house, stuccoed over to match the rest of the mansion. Judge Thomas Swann acquired the property around 1800. Around 1830 Swann built the center two-story portion of the house, with flanking pavilions. It is not known whether the pavilions were initially linked to the house, but the renovations included the prominent tetrastyle Greek Revival portico that dominates the front portico. While the brick structure remains, now stuccoed, none of the Swann interiors exist. Judge Swann's son, Thomas Swann Jr., began a remodeling program around 1850, using the Baltimore firm of E.G. Lind and William T. Murdock as architects, converting the Palladian house to the Italianate style with four towers, including one that was five stories tall, stated by The Buildings of Virginia to resemble Queen Victoria's Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The pavilions were by this time linked to the main house. The towers were later removed by Thomas Swann Jr.'s daughter, Mary Mercer Swann Carter, and her husband, Dr. Shirley Carter. They made more changes, raising the height of the hyphens to two stories and reworking the interior. Westmoreland Davis, a New York lawyer, had roots in Virginia and purchased Morven Park in 1903. He and his wife were avid equestrians, and they quickly became involved in the Virginia fox hunting community. Davis was a founding member of the Loudoun Hunt and served as Master of Foxhounds. He later made Morven Park into an agricultural showpiece, while his wife developed formal boxwood gardens near the house. He served as Virginia's governor from 1918‚Äì1922. He and his wife were the last private owners of the estate, which is now run as a nonprofit organization that raises money to keep the park open to the public. From 1967‚Äì1991, Morven Park was home to the world-renowned Morven Park International Equestrian Institute. The Institute was a training center for riding instructors, teaching advanced dressage, 3-day-eventing and show jumping. A number of expert riders trained at Morven Park went on to international equestrian competition. In its day, Morven Park was considered the most prestigious riding school in the United States, and flourished under the direction of Major John Lynch, an instructor at the British Army Equitation School at Weedon, as well as at the English military academies of Sandhurst and Woolrich. He had been coach and trainer to British, Irish and American Olympic teams.  Today  In 2017 Morven Park International Equestrian Center began a multimillion-dollar renovation and Polo in the Park was launched.  Programs  With its 1,000 acres of rolling hills and pristine landscapes, Morven Park is considered to be the \\"Central Park\\" of rapidly growing Loudoun County, Virginia, the wealthiest county in the United States. Every year, more than 200,000 visitors enjoy a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, museum tours, equestrian events, and field sports. As a nonprofit organization, Morven Park relies on donations from supporters to keep its gates open to visitors. Morven Park is also the home of the Center for Civic Impact, which teaches civic skills that help prepare students in grades K‚Äì12 to become engaged citizens. In partnership with Loudoun County Public Schools, this program complements elementary, middle and high school curricula, and expands, invigorates and connects classroom learning to the real world.

It is on the east rim of the Pine Creek Gorge, also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania, which is deep and nearly across here. It also serves as headquarters for the adjoining Colton Point State Park, its sister park on the west rim of the gorge. Leonard Harrison State Park is known for its views of the Pine Creek Gorge, and offers hiking, fishing and hunting, whitewater boating, and camping. The park is in Shippen and Delmar Townships, west of Wellsboro at the western terminus of Pennsylvania Route 660. Pine Creek flows through the park and has carved the gorge through five major rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. Native Americans once used the Pine Creek Path along the creek. The path was later used by lumbermen, and then became the course of a railroad from 1883 to 1988. Since 1996, the Pine Creek Rail Trail has followed the creek through the park. The Pine Creek Gorge was named a National Natural Landmark in 1968 and is also protected as a Pennsylvania State Natural Area and Important Bird Area, while Pine Creek is a Pennsylvania Scenic and Wild River. The gorge is home to many species of plants and animals, some of which have been reintroduced to the area. Although the Pine Creek Gorge was clearcut in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it is now covered by second growth forest, thanks in part to the conservation efforts of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s. The park is named for Leonard Harrison, a Wellsboro lumberman who cut the timber there, then established the park, which he donated to the state in 1922. The CCC improved the park and built many of its original facilities. Since a successful publicity campaign in 1936, the park has been a popular tourist destination and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Leonard Harrison State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) Bureau of Parks for its \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\" list, which praised its \\"spectacular vistas and a fabulous view of Pine Creek Gorge, also known as Pennsylvania's Grand Canyon\\".  History  = Native Americans = Humans have lived in what is now Pennsylvania since at least 10,000 BC. The first settlers were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. Note: For a general overview of Native American History in the West Branch Susquehanna watershed, see Note: ISBN refers to the Heritage Books July 1996 reprint. URL is to a scan of the 1892 version with some OCR typos. The hunter- gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000 BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000 BC and 1500 AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrows, and ornaments. Leonard Harrison State Park is in the West Branch Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks.The earliest written record of contact with the Susquehannocks comes from Captain John Smith of Jamestown, who met members of the tribe near the mouth of the Susquehanna River on Chesapeake Bay in 1608. The tribe controlled the Susquehanna drainage basin and are believed to have lived there for at least a few centuries prior to this contact. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large long houses, and \\"occasionally inhabited\\" the mountains surrounding the Pine Creek Gorge. Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. The Iroquois lived in long houses, primarily in what is now New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. They and other tribes used the Pine Creek Path through the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there. They used the path through the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it, including one just north of the park near what is now the village of Ansonia. Note: ISBN refers to 1998 impression To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).Note: ISBN refers to a 1999 reprint edition, URL is for the Susquehanna River Basin Commission's web page of Native American Place names, quoting and citing the book. The French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763) led to the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin. On November 5, 1768, the British acquired the New Purchase from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, including what is now Leonard Harrison State Park. The Purchase line established by this treaty was disputed, as it was unclear whether the border along \\"Tiadaghton Creek\\" referred to present-day Pine Creek or to Lycoming Creek, further to the east. As a result, the land between them was disputed territory until 1784 and the Second Treaty of Fort Stanwix. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania, although some isolated bands of Natives remained in Pine Creek Gorge until the War of 1812. = Lumber era = Prior to the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682, up to 90 percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods: more than of eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, and a mix of hardwoods. The forests near the three original counties, Philadelphia, Bucks, and Chester, were the first to be harvested, as the early settlers used the readily available timber to build homes, barns, and ships, and cleared the land for agriculture. The demand for wood products slowly increased and by the time of the American Revolution the lumber industry had reached the interior and mountainous regions of Pennsylvania. Lumber thus became one of the leading industries in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons. A log raft on Pine Creek By the early 19th century the demand for lumber reached the Pine Creek Gorge, where the surrounding mountainsides were covered with eastern white pine in diameter and or more tall, eastern hemlock in circumference, and huge hardwoods. Each of these virgin forests produced of white pine and of hemlock and hardwoods. For comparison, the same area of forest today produces a total of only on average. According to Steven E. Owlett, environmental lawyer and author, shipbuilders considered pine from Pine Creek the \\"best timber in the world for making fine ship masts\\", so it was the first lumber to be harvested on a large scale. Pine Creek was declared a public highway by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on March 16, 1798, and rafts of spars were floated down the creek to the Susquehanna River, then to the Chesapeake Bay and the shipbuilders at Baltimore. The lumbermen would then walk home, following the old Pine Creek Path at the end of their journey. A spar sold for one dollar and three spars up to long were lashed together to make a ship's mast. The largest spar produced on Pine Creek was in diameter above the base, long, and in diameter at the top. By 1840, Tioga County alone produced over 452 such spar rafts with more than of lumber. A lumber mill in Asaph, in the Pine Creek watershed ‚Äì few trees remain on the mountain behind As the 19th century progressed, fewer pines were left and more hemlocks and hardwoods were cut and processed locally. By 1810 there were 11 sawmills in the Pine Creek watershed, and by 1840 there were 145, despite a flood in 1832 which wiped out nearly all the mills along the creek. Selective harvesting of pines was replaced by clearcutting of all lumber in a tract. The first lumbering activity to take place close to what is now Leonard Harrison State Park occurred in 1838 when William Dodge and some partners built a settlement at Big Meadows and formed the Pennsylvania Joint Land and Lumber Company. Dodge's company purchased thousands of acres of land in the area, including what is now Colton Point State Park. In 1865 the last pine spar raft floated down the creek, and on March 28, 1871 the General Assembly passed a law allowing splash dam construction and clearing of creeks to allow loose logs to float better. The earliest spring log drives floated up to of logs in Pine Creek at one time. These logs floated to the West Branch Susquehanna River and to sawmills near the Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport. Hemlock wood was not widely used until the advent of wire nails, but the bark was used to tan leather. After 1870 the largest tanneries in the world were in the Pine Creek watershed, and required of bark to produce of quality sole leather. In 1883 the Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway opened, following the creek through the gorge. The new railroad used the relatively level route along Pine Creek to link the New York Central Railroad with the Clearfield Coalfield. In the surrounding forests, log drives gave way to logging railroads, which transported lumber to local sawmills. There were 13 companies operating logging railroads along Pine Creek and its tributaries between 1886 and 1921, while the last log drive in the Pine Creek watershed started on Little Pine Creek in 1905. The west rim, which became Colton Point State Park, had a logging railroad by 1903, which was able to harvest lumber on Fourmile Run that had been previously inaccessible. The old-growth forests were clearcut by the early 20th century and the gorge was stripped bare. Nothing was left except the dried-out tree tops, which became a fire hazard, so much of the land burned and was left barren. On May 6, 1903 the Wellsboro newspaper had the headline \\"Wild Lands Aflame\\" and reported landslides through the gorge. The soil was depleted of nutrients, fires baked the ground hard, and jungles of blueberries, blackberries, and mountain laurel covered the clearcut land, which became known as the \\"Pennsylvania Desert\\". Disastrous floods swept the area periodically and much of the wildlife was wiped out. = Nessmuk and Leonard Harrison = George W. Sears (1821‚Äì1890), also known as Nessmuk George Washington Sears, an early conservationist who wrote under the pen name \\"Nessmuk\\", was one of the first to criticize Pennsylvania lumbering and its destruction of forests and creeks. (No ISBN) In his 1884 book Woodcraft he wrote of the Pine Creek watershed where > A huge tannery ... poisons and blackens the stream with chemicals, bark and > ooze. ... The once fine covers and thickets are converted into fields > thickly dotted with blackened stumps. And, to crown the desolation, heavy > laden trains of 'The Pine Creek and Jersey Shore R.R.' go thundering [by] > almost hourly ... Of course, this is progress; but, whether backward or > forward, had better be decided sixty years hence. Nessmuk's words went mostly unheeded in his lifetime and did not prevent the clearcutting of almost all of the virgin forests in Pennsylvania. Sears lived in Wellsboro from 1844 until his death in 1890, and was the first to describe the Pine Creek Gorge. He also described a trip to what became Leonard Harrison State Park: after a buggy ride, he then had to hike through tangles of fallen trees and branches, down ravines, and over banks for five hours. At least he reached \\"The Point\\", which he wrote was \\"the jutting terminus of a high ridge which not only commands a capital view of the opposite mountain, but also of the Pine Creek Valley, up and down for miles\\".Quoted in A Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC) state historical marker commemorating Nessmuk was dedicated in the park in 1972. Leonard Harrison (1850‚Äì1929) The creation of the park was the work of Leonard Harrison, a former lumberman and businessman from Wellsboro who owned a substantial amount of land in the Pine Creek Gorge. In the 1890s Harrison operated a sawmill at Tiadaghton in the middle of the gorge, which was supplied with logs, not by train as was most common in that era, but by a log slide built into the side of the gorge. The log slide was used on a year-round basis: during the winter the logs slid down on ice; following the snowmelt the slide was greased to ease the descent of the logs. After the village and the mill were destroyed by a fire, Harrison turned his attention to tourism. He purchased of land at the site of the current park in 1906, then developed this land, known as \\"The Lookout\\", and invited the public to enjoy the beauty of Pine Creek Gorge. Harrison donated the picnic grounds to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1922. Although the park was donated to the state, the Wellsboro Chamber of Commerce made initial improvements there and operated it for the first two decades. Elsewhere in the gorge the state bought land abandoned by lumber companies, sometimes for less than . Except for the adjoining Colton Point State Park, this land became the Tioga State Forest, which was officially established in 1925 and lies just north and south of the park. As of 2008 the state forest encompasses , mostly in Tioga County. = Modern era = Despite its status as Leonard Harrison State Forest Park, it took time for the park to become more well known. Access to the park over small roads was still difficult. An elderly woman who had lived nearby all her life visited the park for the first time in 1932 and asked, on seeing the gorge, \\"How long has this been here?\\" A statue honoring the Civilian Conservation Corps workers who built many of the facilities in Leonard Harrison and Colton Point State Parks The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) improved access and constructed many of the amenities at Leonard Harrison park from 1933 to 1936, during the Great Depression. Leonard Harrison State Park is one of many examples of the work of the CCC throughout north-central Pennsylvania. The CCC built picnic and comfort facilities, made roads and trails (often following old logging roads), and planted stands of white pine, spruce and larch. Some of the CCC- constructed facilities remain and are still used, and the park has hosted a reunion of former CCC workers each summer since 1990. In 1936 Larry Woodin of Wellsboro and other Tioga County business owners began a tourism campaign to promote the Pine Creek Gorge as \\"The Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania\\". Greyhound Bus Lines featured a view of the canyon from a Leonard Harrison lookout on the back cover of its Atlantic Coast timetable. The bus line's Chicago to New York City tour had an overnight stay in Wellsboro and a morning visit to the canyon for $3. More than 300,000 tourists visited the canyon by the autumn of 1936, and 15,000 visited Leonard Harrison over Memorial Day weekend in 1937. That year more visitors came to the Pine Creek Gorge than to Yellowstone National Park. In response to the heavy use of the local roads, the CCC widened the highways in the area, and guides from the CCC gave tours of the canyon. A PHMC state historical marker honoring the CCC's work in the park and county was dedicated on June 3, 1995. Near the lookout over the gorge there is a bronze statue of a \\"Tioga County CCC Worker\\", unveiled on August 14, 1999, as a monument to the achievements of the CCC. Pine Creek and the bottom of the gorge within the park After the Second World War the state took over operation of the park, and expanded its size beyond the original land donated by Harrison: six purchases between 1946 and 1949 increased the park's area from to at a cost of $26,328. The Pennsylvania Geographic Board dropped the word Forest and officially named it Leonard Harrison State Park on November 11, 1954. The park was improved in the following decade with the completion of new latrines (1963) and a new concession stand and visitor center (1968). Pine Creek was named a state scenic river on December 4, 1992, which ensured further protection of Pine Creek Gorge in its natural state. In 1997 the park's Important Bird Area (IBA) was one of the first 73 IBAs established in Pennsylvania. In 2000 the park became part of the Hills Creek State Park complex, an administrative grouping of eight state parks in Potter and Tioga counties. Note: the eight parks in the Hills Creek State Park Complex are Cherry Springs, Colton Point, Denton Hill, Hills Creek, Leonard Harrison, Lyman Run, Patterson, and Prouty Place. In 2005 the state began a $1.2 million upgrade of park facilities, including a new maintenance building, the replacement of three pit latrines at the overlook and campground, the addition of showers at the campground, and the conversion of all restrooms to flush toilets. The second half of the 20th century saw great changes in the rail line through the park. Regular passenger service on the canyon line ended after the Second World War, and in 1960 the second set of train tracks was removed. Conrail abandoned the section of the railroad passing through the gorge on September 21, 1988. The right-of-way eventually became the Pine Creek Rail Trail, which follows the path of the former Pine Creek Path. The first section of the rail trail opened in 1996 and included the section in the park: as of 2008 the Pine Creek Rail Trail is long. Leonard Harrison State Park continued to attract national attention in the post-war era. The New York Times featured the park and its \\"breath-taking views of the gorge\\" as well as its trails and picnic groves in a 1950 article, and in 1966 praised the whitewater boating on Pine Creek and the park's \\"outstanding look-out points\\". The Pine Creek Gorge, including Leonard Harrison and Colton Point State Parks and a section of Tioga State Forest, was named a National Natural Landmark (NNL) in April 1968. The plaque for the entire NNL is on the lookout terrace of Leonard Harrison State Park. Another New York Times article on whitewater canoeing in 1973 noted the damage along the creek done by Hurricane Agnes the year before, and Leonard Harrison's waterfalls. In the new millennium, the two state parks on either side of the Pine Creek Gorge are frequently treated as one. A 2002 New York Times article called Leonard Harrison and Colton Point state parks \\"Two State Parks, Divided by a Canyon\\" and noted their \\"overlooks offer the most spectacular views\\". Leonard Harrison and Colton Point were each included in the list of state parks chosen by the DCNR Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\" list. The DCNR describes how they \\"offer spectacular vistas and a fabulous view of Pine Creek Gorge, also known as Pennsylvania's Grand Canyon\\". It goes on to praise their inclusion in a National Natural Landmark and State Park Natural Area, hiking and trails, and the Pine Creek Rail Trail and bicycling.  Pine Creek Gorge  Map showing the park and important locations in its history in the Pine Creek Gorge and Tioga and Lycoming Counties Leonard Harrison State Park lies on the east side of the Pine Creek Gorge, also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania. A sister park, Colton Point State Park, is on the west side, and the two parks combined form essentially one large park that includes parts of the gorge and creek and parts of the plateau dissected by the gorge. Pine Creek has carved the gorge nearly through the dissected Allegheny Plateau in northcentral Pennsylvania. The canyon begins in southwestern Tioga County, just south of the village of Ansonia, and continues south to near the village of Waterville in Lycoming County. The depth of the gorge in Colton Point State Park is about and it measures nearly across. The Pine Creek Gorge National Natural Landmark includes Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks and parts of the Tioga State Forest along of Pine Creek between Ansonia and Blackwell. This federal program does not provide any extra protection beyond that offered by the land owner. The National Park Service's designation of the gorge as a National Natural Landmark notes that it \\"contains superlative scenery, geological and ecological value, and is one of the finest examples of a deep gorge in the eastern United States.\\" The gorge is also protected by the state of Pennsylvania as the Pine Creek Gorge Natural Area, which is the second largest State Natural Area in Pennsylvania. Within this area, of Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks are designated a State Park Natural Area. The state Natural Area runs along Pine Creek from Darling Run in the north (just below Ansonia) to Jerry Run in the south (just above Blackwell). It is approximately long and wide, with state forest roads providing all of the western border and part of the eastern border. Retrieved on September 30, 2008. Within the park, Pine Creek and the walls of the gorge \\"visible from the opposite shoreline\\" are also protected by the state as a Pennsylvania Scenic River. In 1968 Pine Creek was one of only 27 rivers originally designated as eligible to be included in the National Wild and Scenic River system, and one of only eight specifically mentioned in the law establishing the program. Before Pine Creek could be included in the federal program, the state enacted its State Scenic Rivers Act, then asked that Pine Creek be withdrawn from the national designation. However, there was much local opposition to its inclusion on the state's list, based at least partly on mistaken fears that protection would involve seizure of private property and restricted access. Eventually this opposition was overcome, but Pennsylvania did not officially include it as one of its own state Scenic and Wild Rivers until November 25, 1992. The state treated Pine Creek as if it were a state scenic river between 1968 and 1992. It protected the creek from dam-building and water withdrawals for power plants, and added public access points to reduce abuse of private property. (No ISBN)  Geology and climate  Little Fourmile Run's first waterfall, seen from the Turkey Path, which descends to the bottom of the Pine Creek Gorge. Although the rock formations exposed in Leonard Harrison State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge are at least 300 million years old, the gorge itself formed only about 20,000 years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near the present village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, which caused a reversal of the flow of Pine Creek. The creek flooded to the south and quickly carved a deep channel on its way to the West Branch Susquehanna River. The park is at an elevation of on the Allegheny Plateau, which formed in the Alleghenian orogeny some 300 million years ago, when Gondwana (specifically what became Africa) and what became North America collided, forming Pangaea. While the gorge and its surroundings appear mountainous, these are not true mountains: instead years of erosion have made this a dissected plateau, causing the \\"mountainous\\" terrain seen today. The hardest of the ancient rocks are on top of the ridges, while the softer rocks eroded away forming the valleys. The land on which Leonard Harrison State Park sits has undergone tremendous change over the last 400 million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Pine Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, limestone, and coal. The second waterfall on Little Fourmile Run cascades over layers of ancient rock. Five major rock formations are present in Leonard Harrison State Park, from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park and along the gorge, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. Low-sulfur coal was once mined at three locations within the Pine Creek watershed. Below this is the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, which is formed with grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. Millstones were once carved from the exposed sections of this conglomerate. Together the Pottsville and Mauch Chunk formations are some thick. Next below these is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of grayish- red shale and olive-gray sandstone. This is relatively hard rock and forms many of the ridges. Below this is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation, about thick and some 375 million years old. This layer is relatively soft and easily eroded, which helped to form the Pine Creek Gorge. Cliffs formed by the Huntley Mountain and Catskill formations are visible north of the park at Barbour Rock. The lowest and oldest layer is the Lock Haven Formation, which is gray to green-brown siltstone and shale over 400 million years old. It forms the base of the gorge, contains marine fossils, and is up to thick. The dominant soil in Leonard Harrison State Park is somewhat excessively drained Oquaga channery loam, which is often associated with well drained Lordstown channery loam. Much of the campground near the eastern boundary is supported by Morris gravelly silt loam, which is somewhat poorly drained due to a subsoil fragipan. The Oquaga tends to be very strongly acidic (pH 4.8), Morris is strongly acidic (pH 5.3) and Lordstown is moderately acidic (pH 5.5). All of these soils belong to the Inceptisol soil order.http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx The Allegheny Plateau has a continental climate, with occasional severe low temperatures in winter and average daily temperature ranges of 20 ¬∞F (11 ¬∞C) in winter and 26 ¬∞F (14 ¬∞C) in summer. The mean annual precipitation for the Pine Creek watershed is . The highest recorded temperature at the park was in 1936, and the record low was in 1934. On average, July is the hottest month at Leonard Harrison, January is the coldest, and June the wettest.  Ecology  Clearcutting led to the \\"Pennsylvania Desert\\", caused local extinction of many species, and changed the seasonal flow of streams. Descriptions from early explorers and settlers give some idea of what the Pine Creek Gorge was like before it was clearcut. The forest was up to 85 percent hemlock and white pine, with the rest hardwoods. (No ISBN) Many animal species that are now vanished inhabited the area. A herd of 12,000 American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773. Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, panthers, fishers, foxes and bobcats, all save the last three now locally extinct. The area had herds of elk and deer, and large numbers of black bears, river otters, and beavers. In 1794, two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks that they had to sleep in their canoe. Further upstream, insects forced them to do the same. The virgin forests cooled the land and streams. Centuries of accumulated organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into the creeks and runs, so they flowed more evenly year-round. (No ISBN) Pine Creek was home to large numbers of fish, including trout, but dams downstream on the Susquehanna River have eliminated the shad, salmon,Early accounts of \\"salmon\\" in Pine Creek may have been referring to shad. and eels once found in the creek. The clearcutting of forests destroyed habitat for animals, but there was also a great deal of hunting, with bounties paid for large predators. = State Natural Area and wildlife = Looking north from Leonard Harrison State Park in autumn While Leonard Harrison and Colton Point State Parks and parts of the surrounding Tioga State Forest are now the Pine Creek Gorge National Natural Landmark, it is their status as part of a Pennsylvania State Natural Area that provides the strongest protection for them. Within this Natural Area, all logging, mining, and oil and gas drilling are prohibited, and only foot trail access is allowed. In 1988 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, precursor to the DCNR, described it as > about 95% State owned, unroaded, and designated the Pine Creek Gorge Natural > Area. It is a place of unique geologic history and contains some rare plant > communities, an old growth hemlock stand, ... active bald eagle nest[s] ... > and is a major site of river otter reintroduction. Departmental policy is > protection of the natural values of the Canyon from development and overuse, > and restoration of the area to as near a natural condition as possible. The gorge has over 225 species of wildflowers, plants and trees, (No ISBN) with scattered stands of old growth forest on some of its steepest walls. The rest of the gorge is covered with thriving second growth forest that can be over one hundred years old. However, since clearcutting, nearly 90 percent of the forest land has burnt at least once. Typical south-facing slopes here have mountain laurel below oak and hickory trees, while north-facing slopes tend to have ferns below hemlocks and hardwoods. Large chestnuts and black cherry can also be found. The Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania is known for its fall foliage, and Leonard Harrison State Park is a popular place to observe the colors, with the first three weeks of October as the best time to see the leaves in their full color. Red leaves are found on red maple, red oak, and black cherry, while orange and yellow leaves are on black walnut, sugar maple, aspen, birch, tulip poplar and chestnut oak, and brown leaves are from beech, white oak, and eastern black oak trees. Plants of \\"special concern\\" in Pennsylvania that are found in the gorge include Jacob's ladder, wild pea, and hemlock parsley. Second-growth forest along Little Fourmile Run, as seen from the Turkey Path There are over 40 species of mammals in the Pine Creek Gorge. Leonard Harrison State Park's extensive forest cover makes it a habitat for \\"big woods\\" wildlife, including white-tailed deer, black bear, wild turkey, red and gray squirrels. Less common creatures include bobcats, coyote, fishers, river otters, and timber rattlesnakes. There are over 26 species of fish in Pine Creek, including trout, suckers, fallfish, and rock bass. Other aquatic species include crayfish and frogs. Several species have been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were imported from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish what had once been a thriving population. The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced beginning in 1906, after the lumberman had moved out of the area. The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite the fears of anglers, their diet is only 5 percent trout. Fishers, medium-sized weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge as part of an effort to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moths, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed. = Important Bird Area = Turkey vulture at Leonard Harrison State Park Leonard Harrison State Park is part of Important Bird Area #28, which encompasses of both publicly and private held land. State managed acreage accounts for 68 percent of the total area and includes Leonard Harrison and Colton Point State Parks and the surrounding Tioga State Forest lands. The Pennsylvania Audubon Society has designated all of Leonard Harrison State Park as part of the IBA, which is an area designated as a globally important habitat for the conservation of bird populations. Ornithologists and bird watchers have recorded a total of 128 species of birds in the IBA. Several factors contribute to the high total of bird species observed: there is a large area of forest in the IBA, as well as great habitat diversity, with of open water that is used by many of the birds, especially bald eagles. The location of the IBA along the Pine Creek Gorge also contributes to the diverse bird populations. In addition to bald eagles, which live in the IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to belted kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, blue and green heron, hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. The woodlands are inhabited by the ruffed grouse, Pennsylvania's state bird, and wild turkeys. Swainson's thrush breeds in the IBA and the northern harrier breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge. A variety of warblers is found in Leonard Harrison State Park. The Pennsylvania Audubon Society states that Pine Creek Gorge is \\"especially rich in warbler species, including Pine, Black- throated Blue, Black-throated Green, Blackburnian, and Black-and-white.\\" Note: This guide is available both as a book (page number given) and website (URL given). Many of these smaller birds are more often heard than seen as they keep away from the trails and overlooks.  Recreation  = Trails = Near the upper trailhead of the Turkey Path Leonard Harrison State Park is a destination for avid hikers, with some challenging hikes in and around the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania. The park has of trails that feature very rugged terrain, pass close to steep cliffs, and can be slick in some areas. In 2003, the DCNR reported that 37,775 people used the trails in the park, and another 24,407 bicycled in it. * Overlook Trail is a path to Otter View, a vista looking to the south. This moderately difficult loop passes reminders of the CCC's work in the park, including a plantation of red pines and an old incinerator. * Turkey Path is a difficult trail, long (down and back), that follows Little Fourmile Run down the side of the canyon, descending over to Pine Creek and the rail trail at the bottom of the gorge. It was originally a mule drag used to haul timber to the creek. There are several waterfalls on the trail, which passes through an environmentally sensitive area and is on a steep slope. Hikers are encouraged to remain on the path to reduce erosion and protect fragile plant life along the trail. In 2006 a hiker who had left the path slipped near a waterfall and fell to his death. A vista at the halfway point on Turkey Path was constructed in 1978 by the Youth Conservation Corps. Hand rails, steps and observation decks were added to the path in 1993 by the Pennsylvania Conservation Corps. The park website classifies it as a \\"down and back trail\\" since there is no bridge across Pine Creek. However, there is also a Turkey Path from Colton Point State Park on the west rim of the gorge down to a point on Pine Creek just upstream of the end of this trail. According to Owlett and the DCNR Pine Creek Rail Trail map, the creek can be forded with care when the water is low, and the Turkey Path connects the two parks. * Pine Creek Rail Trail is a rail trail from Wellsboro Junction, just north of Wellsboro, south through the Pine Creek Gorge to Jersey Shore: of this trail is in Leonard Harrison and Colton Point State Parks. A 2001 article in USA Today said the scenic beauty of the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania made the trail one of \\"10 great places to take a bike tour\\" in the world. = Camping and picnics = Looking south into the Pine Creek Gorge from the Otter vista, the nearly level horizon is a hallmark of a dissected plateau. Camping is a popular pastime at Leonard Harrison State Park, with 3,511 persons using the rustic camping facilities in 2003. The DCNR classifies camping facilities as \\"rustic\\" if they do not have flush toilets or showers. The state has renovated the park camping area since 2003, building modern bathrooms with flush toilets and hot showers, and no longer considers it \\"rustic\\". The park has updated electric sites for RV campers as well. The campground has picnic tables and fire rings. The park has almost 100 picnic tables for use; seven of these tables are in shelters. The park hosted some 29,150 picnickers in 2003. = Hunting, fishing, and whitewater = Hunting is permitted on about of Leonard Harrison State Park: hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania State Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, and black bear; however, hunting groundhog is prohibited. Additional acres of forested woodlands are available for hunting on the grounds of the adjacent Tioga State Forest. Fishing is permitted at the state park, though anglers must descend the Turkey Path to reach Pine Creek. This has been designated as approved trout waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, which means the waters will be stocked with trout and may be fished during trout season. Other species of fish found in Pine Creek include smallmouth bass and some panfish. Several small trout streams are accessible from within the park, which had 2,597 anglers in 2003. Historically, fishermen of note on the stretch of Pine Creek in the park include President Theodore Roosevelt and Pennsylvania Governor William A. Stone. Edward Gertler writes in Keystone Canoeing that Pine Creek \\"is possibly Pennsylvania's most famous canoe stream\\" and attributes this partly to the thousands who decide to boat on it after they \\"peer into Pine Creek's spectacular abyss from the overlooks of Leonard Harrison and Colton Point state parks\\". The park contains of Pine Creek, which is Class 1 to Class 2 whitewater here. Boaters do not normally start or end their run in the park, which has no launches: it is part of the trip from Ansonia (Marsh Creek) south to Blackwell (Babb Creek).  Nearby state parks  Leonard Harrison State Park is mostly in Shippen Township, with a small portion in Delmar Township north of Stowell Run. It is west of Wellsboro at the western terminus of Pennsylvania Route 660.

It is unique for having two segments, which are separated by over from each other. The first segment, traveling north‚Äìsouth, connects the cities of Georgetown and Florence, via the towns of Hemingway, Johnsonville, and Pamplico. The second segment, near Fort Mill, is a reciprocated continuation of North Carolina Highway 51 (NC 51) from the North Carolina state line to U.S. Route 21 (US 21). Route description Map of the northern segment of SC 51 The main segment of SC 51 begins at US 701, just north of Georgetown. Traveling at a northwesterly direction, along Browns Ferry Road, it merges onto SC 41 in Rhems. For the next , SC 41/SC 51 straddle the county line between Georgetown and Williamsburg counties, before breaking off towards Hemingway, near Rome Crossroads. Connecting with SC 261 in Hemingway, it soon enters Florence County and Johnsonville. Continuing north, it changes from traveling along SC 41 to US 378 in Kingsburg and continues west. After , it splits from US 378 in Salem, traveling northwest along Pamplico Highway towards Pamplico and finally Florence. In Florence, SC 51 connects with US 301 (Freedom Boulevard) and US 52 (Irby Street); it then travels west along Second Loop Road to US 76 where it ends. The majority of the route is a two-lane rural road through mostly swamp and farmland. Around Hemingway and Florence, the route expands to four lanes and has a median. The York County segment of SC 51 is a short road that starts at US 21 near Fort Mill and ends at the North Carolina state line, where it continues on as NC 51 through Pineville. The route is entirely two-lane, expanding to four lanes at the state line. History Established as a new primary routing in 1926; the original routing ran from SC 40 (today as US 701) along Choppee Road (today as S-22-4) and Hemingway Highway (today as SC 261) to Hemingway then onto Florence, ending at SC 41 (today as US 52). The route was fully paved by 1939. In the early 1960s, the SC 51 was rerouted as a concurrency with SC 41 from Hemingway to Rhems, then to US 701 near Georgetown. In 1978, SC 51 was extended along Second Loop Road, in Florence, to US 76. The York County segment of SC 51 was established in 1969. In the prior year, US 21 was rerouted northwest onto a new freeway route into North Carolina and its old alignment through Pineville was replaced by an extension of NC 51 to the state line. South Carolina reciprocated with SC 51, keeping the route number consistent across the border. Junction list Florence connector route South Carolina Highway 51 Connector (SC 51 Conn.) is a connector route that serves to connect SC 51 and US 51\\\\. Its entire length is known as Pamplico Highway and is unsigned. It begins at an intersection with the SC 51 mainline (known as West 2nd Loop Road west of here and also known as Pamplico Highway east of here). It travels to the northwest and immediately curves slightly more to the north-northwest. It then reaches its northern terminus, an intersection with US 52 (South Irby Street) and the southern terminus of James Jones Avenue.

Walton is at the southwest edge of the town, next to the parish of Stockton Heath. It is also close to Daresbury and Moore, although these are in the neighbouring borough of Halton. Walton is part of the council ward of Hatton, Stretton and Walton. Walton is divided into Lower Walton and Higher Walton. Higher Walton is south-west of Lower Walton, and is the location of Walton Hall. The estate of Walton Hall and its surrounding gardens, previously owned by the Greenall family, was bought by Warrington Borough Council in 1941 and is now a park with a zoo and municipal golf course. Walton shares its annual church walking day parade with Stockton Heath. The nearest schools are Stockton Heath Primary School and Bridgewater High School. The name Walton comes from settlement/farmstead of Wealas - native Celts which is what the new Anglo Saxon speaking peoples called the native inhabitants of England. There is strong evidence that in many areas of England taken over by Germanic speaking settlers, the native British (Wealas) remained undisturbed, farming the same land they did when the Romans left. Over time they just adopted or forgot their Celtic tongue (similar to Old Welsh/Cornish) for the language and culture of the newcomers in order to climb the social ladder or were coerced to do so. It was in the Anglo Saxon interest that the native British carry on as usual to ensure the economy produced food and goods for the new landowners. Higher Walton was the site of a railway accident.

The film stars Massimo Foschi, Me Me Lai and Ivan Rassimov. The screenplay was written by Tito Carpi, Gianfranco Clerici and Renzo Genta, and tells the story of a man trying to escape from a jungle island inhabited by a native cannibal tribe. It is the precursor to Deodato's notoriously controversial Cannibal Holocaust (1980), but was originally slated to be directed by Umberto Lenzi as a follow-up to his prototypical 1972 cannibal film Man from Deep River. While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic. Plot Oil prospectors Rolf and Robert travel to an outpost in a jungle on the island of Mindanao. A rough landing damages the plane. Robert and Rolf find the abandoned remains of the original prospecting camp. They then find a rotting corpse and determine the prospectors were massacred by natives. Later, a member of the team, Swan, goes missing. The two prospectors and their pilot Charlie go into the jungle, and the pilot is killed by a booby trap resembling a large mace. Robert and Rolf then see Swan's remains being eaten by cannibals. After building a raft in order to float down river to get back to the airfield, the men are separated when the raft is destroyed after traversing rapids. Robert, lost in the jungle, eats poisonous mushrooms, which cause him to vomit and pass out. He awakens to find himself being poked and prodded with large spears wielded by the cannibals. Robert is then taken to a cave inhabited by the native tribe. He is tied to a rock and stripped down to his underwear by the natives. A native woman, Pulan, walks up to Robert and tears his underwear off. Two native men then walk up to Robert and violently pull on his penis, horrifying him. The natives then attach Robert to a pulley and bungee him from the top of the cave until he passes out. Robert spends the next several days trapped in a small cave, abused by the natives and fed rotting offal. When asking Pulan for a bowl of water, she instead fondles him. He continues to observe the natives living their daily life, which includes eviscerating, cooking, and eating a large crocodile. Robert manages to escape with Pulan after killing two natives, and keeps her tied to a cord. The two wander through the jungle until Pulan tries escaping, after Robert becomes distracted pulling leeches off of his body while bathing in a lake. When Robert finds Pulan, he violently beats and rapes her. The two then find Rolf, who has been living in a cave and whose leg is infected with gangrene. The three of them wander through the jungle until they eventually find the landing field. The cannibals then set upon them and kill, cook and consume Pulan. After Rolf is hit in the chest with a spear, Robert fights and kills one of the cannibals with a spear laced with cobra venom. Robert then eats the native's liver to frighten the other cannibals. Robert and Rolf then manage to make it to a plane and fly off, but Rolf dies from his chest injury soon after takeoff.

In 2003, the film was allowed to release on DVD, but nearly three minutes of cuts were still required. In Australia, the film was initially banned before being released on VHS with heavy cuts to remove \\"indecent violence\\" Reception Mike Long from DVD Talk gave the film two out of five stars, writing, \\"The problem with Jungle Holocaust is that beyond its shock value, it really doesn't offer anything else to the viewer.\\" In his review, Long criticized the film for its lack of story, character development, and unconvincing gore effects. On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings Dave Sindelar wrote, \\"Of the Italian cannibal movies I‚Äôve seen to this point, this is easily the most savage and the nastiest; it is also better made than the others I‚Äôve seen.

It was isolated originally in the mid-1980s from the chalky soil, or \\"caliche pits\\", located in Kerrville, Texas. The sample was collected by a scientist working for Lederle Labs. Total Synthesis and the Creative Process: An Interview with K.C. Nicolaou, Scripps Research Institute It is extremely toxic to all cells and, in 2000, a CD33 antigen-targeted immunoconjugate N-acetyl dimethyl hydrazide calicheamicin was developed and marketed as targeted therapy against the non-solid tumor cancer acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A second calicheamicin-linked monoclonal antibody, inotuzumab ozogamicin (marketed as Besponsa) an anti-CD22-directed antibody-drug conjugate, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on August 17, 2017, for use in the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.ASH Clinical News, Volume 4, Number 2, January 2018. Newly Approved Drugs in ALL and NHL: How to Use Them in Practice. pp. 26-27. Calicheamicin Œ≥1 and the related enediyne esperamicin are the two of the most potent antitumor agents known.Calicheamicin and Esperamicin are the two most potent antitumor agents known to man , Univ Of Georgia, Chem 4500 Mechanism of toxicity Calicheamicins target DNA and cause strand scission. Calicheamicins bind with DNA in the minor groove, wherein they then undergo a reaction analogous to the Bergman cyclization to generate a diradical species. This diradical, 1,4-didehydrobenzene, then abstracts hydrogen atoms from the deoxyribose (sugar) backbone of DNA, which ultimately leads to strand scission. The specificity of binding of calicheamicin to the minor groove of DNA was demonstrated by Crothers et al. (1999) to be due to the aryltetrasaccharide group of the molecule. Biosynthesis Iterative PKS Schematic of calicheamicin glycosylation pathway The core metabolic pathway for biosynthesis of this molecule resembles that of other characterized enediyne compounds and occurs via an iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway. This type I PKS loads Acetyl-CoA and then repeatedly adds a total of seven Malonyl-CoAs. The growing polyketide is acted upon by the ketoreductase domain (KR) and dehydratase domain (DH) during each iteration to produce a 15-carbon polyene, which is then processed by accessory enzymes to yield the putative enediyne core of calicheamicin. Maturation of the polyketide core is anticipated to occur by the action of additional enzymes to provide a calicheamicinone-like intermediate as a substrate for subsequent glycosylation. Glycosylation of calicheamicinone requires 4 glycosyltransferases (CalG1-4) and one acyltransferase (CalO4), each recognizing a specific sugar nucleotide or orsellinic acid substrate. Ground- breaking biochemical studies of CalG1-G4 by Thorson and coworkers revealed the reactions catalyzed by these glycosyltransferases to be highly reversible. This was a paradigm shift in the context of glycosyltransferase catalysis and Thorson and coworkers went on to demonstrate this to be a general phenomenon that could be exploited for sugar nucleotide synthesis and 'glycorandomization'. The structures of all four glycosyltransferases were also reported by the same group, revealing a conserved calicheamicin binding motif that coordinates the enediyne backbone thorough interactions with aromatic residues. The catalytic site of CalG1, CalG3, and CalG4 was shown to possess a highly conserved catalytic dyad of histidine and aspartate which promotes nucleophilic attack on the acceptor hydroxyl group of calicheamicin intermediates. Notably, this motif is absent from CalG2, suggesting a different catalytic mechanism in this enzyme. Resistance Calicheamicin displays unbiased toxicity to bacteria, fungi, viruses, and eukaryotic cells and organisms, which raises questions as to how the calicheamicin-producing Micromonospora manages not to poison itself. An answer to this question was presented in 2003 when Thorson and coworkers presented the first known example of a \\"self-sacrifice\\" resistance mechanism encoded by the gene calC from the calicheamicin biosynthetic gene cluster. In this study, the scientists revealed calicheamicin to cleave the protein CalC site-specifically, destroying both the calicheamicin and the CalC protein, thereby preventing DNA damage. The same group went on to solve the structure of CalC and, more recently, in collaboration with scientists from the Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI), discover structural or functional homologs encoded by genes in the calicheamicin gene cluster previously listed as encoding unknown function. In this latter study, the authors suggest that CalC homologs may serve in a biosynthetic capacity as the long-sought-after polyketide cyclases required to fold or cyclize early intermediates en route to calicheamicin. History It has been proposed that Alexander the Great was poisoned by drinking the water of the river Mavroneri (identified with the mythological River Styx) which is postulated to have been contaminated by this compound. However, toxicologists believe an extensive knowledge of biological chemistry would have been requisite for any application of this poison in antiquity.

Organization  The Asymmetric Warfare Group is made up by a headquarters and headquarters detachment and four squadrons, each one led by a lieutenant colonel: * Able Squadron (Operations) * Baker Squadron (Operations) * Charlie Squadron (Operations) * Dog Squadron (Concepts Integration) Each squadron is subsequently divided into troops commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel (United States).  Mission  Front and back face of Asymmetric Warfare Group coin. Front and back face of Asymmetric Warfare Group coin. The U.S. Army Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) provides global operational advisory support to enable U.S. Army forces to win against current and emerging asymmetric threats, and prepare for Large Scale Combat Operations (LSCO). The key tasks of Asymmetric Warfare Group is: Advise, Scout and to Assist Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) Integration.  History  The U.S. Army Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) is charged with identifying Army and joint force capability gaps to DOTMLPF-P, and developing solutions to those gaps. It further seeks to identify enemy threats and develop methods to defeat those threats. 2016 marks the group's 10th anniversary. In January, 2006, the AWG was established as a Field Operating Agency under the operational control of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Headquarters, Department of the Army. The AWG was activated on March 8, 2006, at Fort Meade, MD. The AWG was assigned to the TRADOC on November 11, 2011 as a direct reporting unit to the commanding general. The assignment to TRADOC enabled enhanced cooperation with the Army Capabilities Integration Center, Combined Arms Center, and the Centers of Excellence. Since 2011, AWG has experienced a significant growth in Operational Advisory support missions, and activated its third Operational Squadron in 2013. With this enhanced capacity, AWG provides observations, analysis, and solution development into both the operational and institutional forces of the Army. AWG's operational advisors deploy globally to complex operating environments to understand the current and emerging challenges to anticipate the character of future conflict. While their focus is on assisting the operating force, they ensure that any lessons learned are passed to the institutional Army for long-term integration and to enhance the development of our generating force. AWG conducts vulnerability assessments to identify security risks for the Army, bridge the skill and knowledge gap between Special Operations Forces and the regular Army, and assists the Army in developing and implementing the Army Learning Model through AWG's unique instructing methods, or ASLTE, Adaptive Soldier Leader Training and Education. Assessing current and emerging threats: AWG determines friendly force vulnerabilities and enemy threat capabilities and then develops programs of instruction to raise situational awareness and understanding of identified problems. AWG then seeks to integrate the programs of instruction into Combat Training Center (e.g., National Training Center) rotations, as well as in-theater JRSOI training. JRSOI is the process that transitions deploying or redeploying forces, consisting of personnel, equipment, and materiel into forces capable of meeting the CCDR's operational requirements or returns them to their parent organization or Service. In addition, AWG evaluates engagement tactics, techniques, and procedures, and works with the Fires Center of Excellence to institutionalize its findings. AWG has also created a compendium of ISIL techniques and procedures, probable scenarios, and ways to counter them, which are distributed in theater and are available through the Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL). AWG developed a similar product addressing Russian hybrid warfare based on Ukraine. Understand the Complex Operating Environment: through AWG's support to Regionally Aligned Forces and Special Operations Forces, they identified the requirement to bring jungle skills back into the U.S. Army. AWG incorporated lessons learned into the 25th Infantry Division's Lightning Academy and created handbooks for CALL. In addition, observations and trend analysis from globally-deployed operational advisors identified the requirement to raise awareness of tunneling and subterranean operations. AWG created handbooks and references for distribution by CALL. AWG continuously deploys operational advisors in support of theater security cooperation plans and events to identify how the complex environment is changing around the world. A handbook was developed by AWG after working with Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Horn of Africa to inform future leaders and planners of the operational challenges a CJTF has in an environment where the DoD is not the lead agency.

She studies human genetics and is particularly interested in genetic heterogeneity and complex traits. She studies the interaction of genetics and environmental influences and their effects on human conditions such as breast and ovarian cancer, inherited deafness, schizophrenia, HIV, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. King is known for three major accomplishments: demonstrating that humans and chimpanzees are 99% genetically identical; identifying breast cancer genes; and applying genomic sequencing to identify victims of human rights abuses. In 1984, in Argentina, she began working with Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo) in identifying children who had been stolen from their families and adopted illegally under the military dictatorship during the Dirty War (1976‚Äì1983). In 2002, Discover magazine recognized King as one of the 50 most important women in science. Early life Mary-Claire King was born on February 27, 1946, to Harvey and Clarice King of Wilmette, Illinois, near Chicago. Her father worked for Standard Oil of Indiana. When King was 15 years old, her childhood best friend died of cancer. King became interested in science in the hope of learning enough to prevent and treat such illnesses. Education King received her undergraduate degree in mathematics (cum laude) from Carleton College, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1967. King was accepted into the graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley, and soon became politically active. She helped to organize protests against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1970. She says: \\"The single most effective thing we did was on the day after the US invaded Cambodia, we got out our suit jackets and shirtwaist dresses ‚Äì not clothes that any of us had worn since coming to Berkeley ‚Äì and went to the synagogues and churches and by the end of Sunday we had 30,000 letters opposing the action.\\" She dropped out of university briefly after the National Guard was sent in against student protestors. She spent a year doing consumer advocacy work for Ralph Nader, investigating pesticide use and its effects on farm workers. After her return to Berkeley, advisor Allan Wilson persuaded her to switch from mathematics to genetics. King had been introduced to genetics by professor Curt Stern, in the last class he taught before his retirement. In her doctoral work at Berkeley, King demonstrated through comparative protein analysis that chimpanzees and humans were 99% genetically identical. King's work supported Allan Wilson's view that chimpanzees and humans diverged only five million years ago, and King and Wilson suggested that gene regulation was likely responsible for the significant differences between the species.Mary- Claire King, Protein polymorphisms in chimpanzee and human evolution, Doctoral dissertation, University of California, Berkeley (1973). King completed her thesis in 1972, and received her doctorate in genetics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1973. Next King went to Santiago, Chile to teach at the Universidad de Chile as part of a University of California-University of Chile exchange program. Her time there was cut short when the Chilean government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a CIA-backed military coup on September 11, 1973. King and her husband Robert Colwell returned to Berkeley in late December. She later learned that a number of her colleagues and students had either disappeared or been killed. King accepted a postdoctoral position at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), to work with Nicholas L. Petrakis. As of January 1, 1974, King began to work on the problem of why breast cancer tends to appear in families. Family King's younger brother Paul King, a mathematician and business consultant, was the CEO of Vanalco in Vancouver, Washington. King married ecologist Robert K. Colwell in 1973.http://viceroy.colorado.edu/Colwell They have one child, Emily King Colwell, born in 1975. Emily studied the evolution of languages at Brown University with a B.A. in linguistics. King and Colwell divorced in 1983. Career King accepted a faculty appointment at the University of California, Berkeley, as professor of genetics and epidemiology in 1976. She remained at UC Berkeley until 1995, when she accepted an appointment as the American Cancer Society Professor at the University of Washington. Research =Breast cancer= From 1974 to 1990, King carried out years of painstaking research, seeking a genetic marker, an identifiable piece of genetic material, that tended to accompany the presence of breast cancer in families. For much of that time, the predominant theory was that cancer was viral. Most scientists disregarded or attacked her ideas. The idea that genetic patterns could be linked to the incidence of complex diseases was considered an unlikely long shot. Genetics had been recognized as significant in diseases with a simple genetic tie, such as Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, and sickle-cell anemia, but researchers were skeptical about the usefulness of genetics in studying more common and complex diseases involving both multiple genetic factors and environmental influences. King sometimes worried that she was going down a blind alley in trying to study the interplay of genetics with a complex human disease. Nonetheless, the search for the breast cancer susceptibility gene was moving forward with firm steps in King's Lab, and accelerating in the mid-1980s. Based on a series of un-selected breast cancer cases and their family history, in 1988, King's team published a genetic epidemiological model for breast cancer, demonstrating the theoretical existence of a major dominant gene that conferred a high degree of susceptibility to breast cancer in a subset of the population. Applying this genetic penetrance model and using the genotyping technology available at the time, King's team evaluated more than 170 genetic markers, utilizing the gene mapping technique known as linkage analysis. When they in 1990 finally found a genetic marker that showed strong evidence in a subset of families, King's group demonstrated that a single gene on chromosome 17 could be linked to many breast and ovarian cancers, and that genetic heterogeneity was present in breast cancer etiology. A team member suggested that they reorganize their data by age of onset, as in the study cohort, the families in which members had developed cancer at a relatively young age tend to show stronger evidence of linkage to this locus. The idea was that early cases might be more likely to reflect a genetic component, in contrast to sporadic mutations that might occur at any age, or even accrue over time. As many as 5-10% of all cases of breast cancer may be hereditary. In 1991 King officially named the gene BRCA1. Her discovery paved the way for identification of the gene sequence. In September 1994, Myriad Genetics published a paper on the positional cloning of the sequence after a highly publicized \\"race\\" by groups of scientists. In December 1994, King and her collaborators published results based on a second cohort of families. A second gene, BRCA2, was also found. These two genes, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 work to clean up cells in the body that have been harmed by things such as tobacco or just help clean the cells because they have aged. When these genes do not perform these functions, it causes cells to grow and divide quickly, leading to some types of cancers. Both genes worked to suppress the development of cancer tumors, but certain types of genetic mutations could prevent them from doing so. In 1996, with support from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) Mary-Claire King and social worker Joan Marks began the New York Breast Cancer Study, which definitively determined that incidence of breast and ovarian cancer was linked to inherited mutations of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. The researchers studied women of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry in New York, a group that was known to have a very high incidence of breast cancer (up to an 80% risk by age 70 compared to 12% in the general population). She has also studied the incidence of breast cancer in Palestinian women. The discovery of the \\"breast cancer gene\\" revolutionized the study of numerous other diseases and phenotypes. The model and technique King developed to identify BRCA1 has since proven valuable in the study of many other illnesses and conditions. King's contributions have made it possible for people to be informed of genetic information that then can aid them in making choices best for themselves and for their future. Mary- Clarie King also worked on a project studying the mutations of genes linked to breast cancer inheritance in Nigerian women between March 1998 and 2014. King's team decided to do this research on the grounds that more people die in Nigeria from triple negative breast cancer that is diagnosed at a later stage than other, more educated regions of the world, such as Europe or America. At the finish of this study, King's team was still unsure of the reason for such high levels of Triple-negative breast cancer, since many of the people diagnosed were not showing mutations in the BRCA 1 gene. Her study supported the idea that genomic sequencing could be useful as a tool to help detect gene mutations early and be proactive in letting those who have high risks for breast cancer know ahead of time. =Hearing loss and deafness= Since 1990, King has been working in collaboration with scientists around the world to identify genetic causes of hearing loss and deafness. They localized the first nonsyndromic deafness-related gene, DFNA1, in a Costa Rica kindred, and successfully cloned the gene in 1999. King continues to work with scientists Karen Avraham at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Moien Kanaan at Bethlehem University in Palestine, modeling international scientific cooperation in conjunction with conducting scientific research. Hereditary deafness is common among some Palestinian and Israeli communities, providing good study populations to understand the genetics of this condition. The genetic etiology of hearing loss is extremely heterogeneneous, with a very high degree of complexity among Middle Eastern populations, presenting a different level of challenge for genetic analysis. King's collaboration with scientists in Israel and Palestine has resolved the complex web of different genes and varying modes of transmission for this common phenotype among many kindreds in the communities in that region. =Schizophrenia= King in recent years has developed a deep interest in studying the genetic factors influencing schizophrenia. In collaboration with other scientists including Judith L. Rapoport, Jonathan Sebat, and Deborah L. Levy, she has discovered evidence that suggests that schizophrenia may be linked to the presence of genetic mutations called copy number variations (CNVs) in pathways involved in neural development. A percentage of such variations may occur spontaneously as a result of copying errors in cells. =Human Genome Diversity Project= King has also worked on the Human Genome Diversity Project, led by Luca Cavalli- Sforza. The project seeks to delineate the distinctions among individuals in order to further understanding of human evolution and historical migrations. =Romanov exhumation= King is well known for her work on the forensic determination of individual identity, in particular the use of mitochondrial DNA from teeth. King was invited to participate in DNA investigations of the first analysis of Romanov remains exhumed in 1991 in Ekaterinburg, Russia. Human rights work King first applied her genetics skills to human rights work in 1984, when she and her lab began working with Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo) in Argentina. She used dental genetics to identify missing persons, ultimately identifying 59 children and helping return them to their biological families. Most had been born to women in prison who had been persecuted as political dissidents and were later \\"disappeared\\" by the Argentine military dictatorship during the eight-year \\"Dirty War\\" from 1976-1983. These children were often illegally \\"adopted\\" by military families without their mother's or other family consent. Beginning in 1977 Las Abuelas (\\"the grandmothers\\") had gathered to protest the disappearance of their grandchildren and seek their return. Every Thursday, they marched to the central plaza in Buenos Aires (\\"Plaza de Mayo\\") to demand the return of their grandchildren, and they began gathering data trying to identify the many missing children (estimated to be 400-500). By the time King joined the project, the dictatorship had been replaced by a democratic government, but it required proof of kinship to remove children from families and return them to biological families. King's technique, using mitochondrial DNA and human leukocyte antigen serotyping genetic markers from dental samples, proved invaluable. The Supreme Court of Argentina in 1984 determined that King's test had positively identified the relationship of Paula Logares to her family, establishing the precedent for the ultimate reunification of dozens of families with their stolen children. Since 1984, this technique has become a major method for genetic identification of the deceased as well as the living. In 1993 King used the technique to identify the remains of individuals massacred in the village of El Mozote, El Salvador. More than 750 adults and children were massacred and buried in mass graves by US-trained Salvadoran soldiers of the Atlacatl Battalion. King has worked with numerous human rights organizations, such as Physicians for Human Rights and Amnesty International, to identify missing people in countries including Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Rwanda, the Balkans (Croatia and Serbia), and the Philippines. King's lab has also provided DNA identification for the U.S. Army, the United Nations, and the U.N.'s war crimes tribunals. King has been supportive of women and ethnic and sexual minorities in science. She has been highly critical of genetic patenting, a practice which was ruled against by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013, on the grounds that \\"genes are natural products and cannot be patented\\".

This allows DNA sequencing to concentrate on the parts of the genome that are most informative and interesting. Concept Briefly, when sheared genomic DNA in solution is heated to near boiling temperature, the molecular forces holding complementary base pairs together are disrupted, and the two strands of each double-helix dissociate or ‚Äòdenature.‚Äô If the denatured DNA is then slowly returned to a cooler temperature, sequences will begin to ‚Äòreassociate‚Äô (renature) with complementary strands. The temperature at which renaturation occurs can be regulated so that little or no sequence mismatch is tolerated. The rate at which a sequence finds a complementary strand with which to hybridize is directly related to how common that sequence is in the genome. In other words, those sequences that are extremely abundant (on average) find complementary strands with which to pair relatively quickly while single-copy sequences take much longer to find complements. In CF, genomic DNA is heat-denatured and allowed to renature to a Cot value (Cot = DNA concentration x time x a factor based on the cation concentration of the buffer) at which the majority of repetitive elements have reassociated but single and low-copy elements remain single stranded. Double-stranded, repetitive DNA is separated from single- stranded, low-copy DNA by hydroxyapatite chromatography or other means. Application CF allows the single/low copy sequences and the repetitive sequences of a genome to be studied independently of each other. It can also be used to fractionate highly repetitive DNA from moderately repetitive sequences or to further fractionate isolated kinetic components. CF is most accurately performed if fractionation is based upon the results of a Cot analysis.

M-106 travels in a southwest-to- northeast direction from Jackson to Gregory at a junction with M-36 just a few miles northwest of Hell. The highway was first designated in 1928 running north out of downtown Jackson. It connected U.S. Highway 12 (US 12) to the state prison and Bunkerhill Road. A pair of changes in the early 1930s resulted in the extension eastward to Gregory. From the 1960s until the early years of the 21st century, a section of M-106 in downtown Jackson was routed along one-way streets. Route description M-106 starts in downtown Jackson at the corner of Cooper Street and Michigan Avenue. Michigan Avenue runs east‚Äìwest carrying Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94), Business US 127 (Bus. US 127) and M-50, and Cooper Street runs northwesterly from here carrying M-106. The highway passes through residential neighborhoods immediately north of downtown, and turns due north near Jackson Catholic Middle School and the historic Michigan State Prison. Continuing a few miles north through an interchange with I-94 and US 127, M-106 runs north out of town. Cooper Street continues out of town, and the trunkline runs by the State Prison of Southern Michigan. North of the current prison, the highway curves to the northwest following Bunkerhill Road. Through this area, M-106 runs through farm fields and forests. The highway turns onto Plum Orchard Road near Batteese Lake and runs east into the community of Munith. M-106 merges onto Territorial Road east of the town before crossing the county line into Ingham County. South of Stockbridge, M-106 merges with M-52 and the two run concurrently into that community. M-106 turns east in the downtown area and continues along Morton Road into Livingston County. The highway ends at a junction with M-36 in Gregory. Intersection of M-106 (Plum Orchard Road) and Musbach Road, the boundary between Henrietta and Waterloo townships M-106 is maintained by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-106 were the 15,474 vehicles daily south of I-94; the lowest counts were the 1,550 vehicles per day in near the M-36 junction. The only section of M-106 has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) is between M-50 and I-94 in Jackson. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History M-106 was first designated in 1928 on a route that ran from US 12 (Michigan Avenue) along Cooper Street to Bunkerhill Road, a total of . This highway was extended north to Stockbridge in late 1930 or early 1931. A further realignment of M-36 resulted in the extension of M-106 to Gregory. Cooper Street in Jackson was converted to one-way, southbound traffic in 1967. A northbound routing along Milwaukee Street was established. The south end of southbound M-106 was trimmed back to end at BL I-94/Bus. US 127/M-50. Two-way traffic was restored in 2004. M-106 was shifted to run only along Cooper Street (formerly Milwaukee Street), and Francis Street (formerly Cooper Street) is left as an unsigned trunkline.

Phylogenetic analyses have found that Oceanodroma paraphyletic with respect to Hydrobates. As a result some authorities have transferred all Oceanodroma species to Hydrobates, although other authorities continue to recognise the two genera.

Overview  Muhammad's inheritance did not occur as is prescribed in the Qur'an, since Abu Bakr, one of Muhammad's most prominent companions said that he heard Muhammad said so. This happened during the Succession to Muhammad, the day after the meeting at Saqifah. Controversially, several of Muhammad's relatives were not convinced of his testimony, and this resulted in a dispute that continued all the way to the era of Umar II, around one hundred years later. People involved in the event include: *Ali - Muhammad's cousin and son- in-law, future fourth Sunni Caliph and first Shi'a Imam *Fatimah - Muhammd's daughter, married to Ali *\`Abbas ibn \`Abd al-Muttalib, also known as Al-Abbas - a paternal uncle of Muhammad. *\`Abd Allah ibn \`Abbas, also known as Ibn Abbas - Muhammad's cousin *Abu Bakr - one of Muhammad's companions and the first Sunni Caliph *Umar - one of Muhammad's companions and the second Sunni Caliph *Uthman - one of Muhammad's companions and the third Sunni Caliph *A'isha - Abu Bakr's daughter and Muhammad's wife *Muhammad's wives, the rest of them The present interpretation of the sources describing the event is also controversial. Shi'a and Sunni do not agree on whether a piece of property named Fadak that was included in conflict between Fatimah and Abu Bakr only constituted inheritance, or if it actually was confiscated by Abu Bakr, and Fatimah demanded it back together with her inheritance.  Event  The events started the day after the death of Muhammad on . Fatimah came with Ali to Abu Bakr.The Book of the Major Classes, Volume 2, page 393 writes: > Fatimah came to Abu Bakr and demanded her share in the inheritance. Al-Abbas > came to him and demanded his share in the inheritance. Ali came with them. > Thereupon Abu Bakr said, \\"The Apostle of God said, \\"We leave no inheritance, > what we leave behind us is sadaqah.\\" I shall make provisions for those for > whom the Prophet had made.\\" The hadith has been reproduced through Abu > Hurairah in , , On this Ali said, \\"Sulayman (Solomon) inherited Dawud > (David), and Zakariya said, ‚ÄòHe may be my heir and the heir of the children > of Jacob (Zachariah about John the Baptist)‚Äô\\". Abu Bakr said, \\"This is as > this is. By God!

Shia also state that Abu Bakr's seizure of Ali and Fatimah's inheritance was complemented by the unjust seizure of the land of Fadak, a gift given to Fatimah during Muhammad's life. Shia Muslims do not view this Hadith as authentic. As Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy notes in his book A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims, Prophet Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. This proves that Prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well. This issue is a hot topic among Shia, and they dedicate long articles to this subject.Fadak; The property of Fatima al-Zahra at answering-ansar.org = Sunni view = Sunni view this conflict between Abu Bakr and Fatimah as unfortunate and are prone to view it as a disagreement with limited consequences.

Her Abbey Series of 38 titles are her best-known and best-loved books.Her major publisher, Collins, republished books from this series (some titles as many as 10 times) between 1920 and 1960 to cater for the demand from readers (Sims & Clare). In her lifetime she had 87 titles published and another two have since been published by her niece, who discovered the manuscripts in the early 1990s. She is considered a major figure among girls' story writers of the first half of the twentieth century, being one of the 'Big Three' with Elinor Brent-Dyer and Dorita Fairlie Bruce.Sims & Clare. Angela Brazil is as well-known - perhaps more so - but did not write her books in series about the same group of characters or set in the same place or school, as did the Big Three. Oxenham's books are widely collected and there are several Appreciation Societies: in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa; with a total membership of over six hundred, some of whom live in the US, Canada, India and The Netherlands although belonging to one or more of the societies mentioned. Biography Elsie Jeanette Dunkerley was born in Southport, Lancashire, England, in November 1880, to an English father and a Scottish mother. Before she was 2 years old the family moved to Ealing, West London, where they lived for nearly forty years. She and her sisters went to private schools and attended Ealing Congregational Church. The six Dunkerley children in order of age were: Elsie, Marjory (Maida), Roderic, Theodora (Theo), Erica and Hugo. The family lived in five different houses during their time in Ealing and moved to Worthing, Sussex, in 1922. She took the surname Oxenham as her pen name when Goblin Island was published in 1907. Her father, William Arthur Dunkerley, had used the pen-name \\"John Oxenham\\" for many years prior to this. During the London years, Elsie Oxenham became involved in the British Camp Fire Girls movement, and qualified as a Guardian - the leader of a group of Camp Fire Girls. She ran this Camp Fire Group for some 6 years, until the move to Sussex. One of the Camp Fire members was Margaret Bayne Todd - later Margaret, Lady Simey - who appears in Abbey Girls in Town and to whom that title was dedicated. It is thought that she was the 'original' on whom the characters of both Jenny-Wren and Littlejan were based.Godfrey 2003 At some point during her time in London Oxenham joined the English Folk Dance Society (EFDS - it did not become the English Folk Dance and Song Society [EFDSS] until much later). She then discovered how 'badly' she had been doing the dances - and teaching them! - as related in The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (published 1922). Everything that the 'Writing Person' [her on-page persona] told Maidlin, Jen and Joy, in The New Abbey Girls (published 1923), about dancing, Grey Edward, and the Camp Fire had happened as described. After the family had moved to Worthing, Oxenham taught folk dancing in nearby villages and schools. She tried to start another Camp Fire but that was not a success as most of the girls of the right age were already Girl Guides. At first, the family all lived at Farncombe Road, Worthing, but after their mother died the four sisters moved out, living in pairs, Elsie with Maida, and Erica with Theo. None of the sisters married, but both brothers did. Elsie died in a local nursing Home in January 1960, a few days after Erica.biographical information, taken with permission, from Monica Godfrey's short biographical piece on the Abbey Chronicle website Books and series =Abbey Series= Oxenham is best known for her Abbey Series of 38 titles which chart the lives of the main characters from their mid-teens until their daughters reach a similar age. The Hamlet Club, formed in the first book in the series Girls of the Hamlet Club, was set up to combat snobbery in the school. Underlying the club‚Äôs overt activities of folk-dancing and rambles was its motto 'To be or not to be', and its badge, the Whiteleaf Cross. These were both symbols of deeper meanings. The motto, deliberately using a quote from the Shakespeare play Hamlet, is taken to mean to make the right choice, usually duty above self-interest, when it arises.Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914), pp. 163-4. Throughout the Abbey Series the various main characters come up against this choice and its consequences, and are shown growing and maturing through making difficult decisions. The badge, taken from a landmark local to the area in which the series is set, is also symbolic‚Äîas is any cross‚Äîof sacrifice.op cit, p.166. The Abbey of the series is almost a character in itself. Based on Cleeve Abbey in Somerset, it first appears as a romantic ruin in the second of the series The Abbey Girls. By the end of this book, the cousins Joan and Joy Shirley are living in Abinger Hall, in the gardens of which the Abbey is situated. Joy has been discovered to be the granddaughter of the late owner, Sir Antony Abinger, and the Hall is left to her, but Joan, who was not related to Sir Antony, has been left the Abbey \\"Because of [her] love for it, and because [her] knowledge of it was so thorough.\\"The Abbey Girls (1920), p. 317. The Abbey and its influence pervades the whole series. Characters try to live up to the precepts of the early Cistercian monks who lived there, and even when facing difficult situations abroad, find that the Abbey ethos helps them find the way through to the right decision.Biddy‚Äôs Secret (1932), p. 132-3 Oxenham depicted herself directly and indirectly in several places within the Abbey series. As \\"The Writing Person\\" she is depicting herself as she was in the early 1920s, over 40 years of age and going to the folk dance classes run by the English Folk Dance Society in London.The New Abbey Girls (1923), pp. 227ff; and The Abbey Girls Again (1924), p. 97. Once Mary-Dorothy Devine, first introduced in The Abbey Girls Again, becomes a writer, statements she makes about the writing experience must logically be those of Oxenham herself. She talks of \\"finding\\" the books, and of \\"listening in to [her own] private wireless\\".The Abbey Girls in Town (1925), p. 163. Some fifteen years later according to the internal chronology of the series, and nearly thirty years later in real time, Mary-Dorothy advises Rachel Ellerton, a younger writer who has been trying to get her adult fiction published, to try writing for children: This statement, from near the end of Oxenham's writing career, seems to convey Oxenham‚Äôs own writing credo. It is quoted in its entirety as one of the few insights Oxenham gives into her own reasons for writing. In her very first book, Goblin Island, published nearly fifty years earlier, and written in the first person, Jean, the narrator, says, This would indicate that her own start in writing was similar; it is certainly known that she typed up the writings of her father, John Oxenham, a task later taken on by her sister Erica Dunkerley, who also used the pseudonym Oxenham for her published writings.Erica Oxenham, J.O. & Scrap- Book of J.O.. Themes and influences =Religion= Oxenham's religious background was in Congregationalism. This gave a Protestant ethos to her writing and her expressed opinions. Many of her characters go through difficult periods in their lives, and their religious beliefs help them through. Several of the books written in the 1920s and 1930s, particularly, include discussions between characters as to the meaning of life and the reasons behind events.for example, in Abbey Girls at Home (1929), pp. 54-5. These in-depth conversations tend to appear less frequently in the later books, but even as late as 1948, in A Fiddler for the Abbey Mary-Dorothy Devine, who has become \\"advisor-in-chief to the clan\\" Robins in the Abbey (1947), p. 226. talks to Rosalind Kane about the biblical concept of \\"rain falling on the just and the unjust\\" and the reasons behind the occurrence of both good and bad events.A Fiddler for the Abbey (1948), pp 106-7. =Folk dancing= Folk dancing is a strong influence in many of the books. From Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914) and At School with the Roundheads (1915) until The Girls of the Abbey School (1921), it was shown as a fairly easy thing for girls to do, and to teach each other. By the time of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (1922) it is apparent that Oxenham herself had come into contact with the English Folk Dance Society and realised that the dances were not so simple after all. The books written from this time for the next six years or so, until Abbey Girls Win Through (1928) depict members of the EFDS hierarchy with affection and almost reverence.see, for instance, the depiction of 'The Pixie' as a wise, all-knowing counsellor in Abbey Girls in Town (1925), pp. 145-9. It seems that something happened to spoil this relationship, as after 1930 these characters do not appear in the books, and are hardly referred to again, certainly not in such glowing terms. The EFDS makes a brief appearance in An Abbey Champion (1946), but the personnel are no longer named. It may have been as simple as the move to Worthing and the impossibility of maintaining as close a friendship at a distance of some sixty miles, but it has been conjectured that 'Madam' (Helen Kennedy North) and 'The Pixie' (Daisy Caroline Daking) may have objected to the way they were being portrayed.see articles by Hilary Clare for The Abbey Chronicle, revised for the Abbey Chronicle web archive on 'Madam' and 'The Pixie' Oxenham never lost the love of folk dancing itself, however, and always shows it as a healthy form of exercise, and a way of lifting oneself out of depression.see, for example, the 'rescue' of Mary-Dorothy Devine in The Abbey Girls Again. =Camp Fire= Camp Fire plays a large part in several of Oxenham‚Äôs books published between 1917 and 1940. Oxenham was a Camp Fire Guardian when she lived in Ealing, but the attempt to form a group in Sussex failed. The Camp Fire ideals of Work, Health and Love‚Äì'Wohelo'‚Äìand the training for young girls in household tasks and cookery it provided, were integral to Oxenham's own philosophy, and underlie the plots of several books. From the Camp Fire as an integral part of a school in A School Camp Fire (1917) and The Crisis in Camp Keema (1928) to the lone Camp Fire Girl, Barbara Holt, in The Junior Captain (1923) and Maidlin becoming a Torchbearer in Maidlin Bears the Torch (1937), Camp Fire is always shown as a way of developing character. As Oxenham became less involved with the organisation, and came more into contact with the Girl Guides, the contrast between the two organisations and their aims are shown,for instance, in Peggy and the Brotherhood (1936), where the whole plot turns on this contrast. and eventually the reality of the changed situation in England at the time meant that Guides were more often mentioned in her books than Camp Fire. Legacy =Place in Children's Literature= Elsie J. Oxenham is considered by collectors of British Girls' Fiction to be one of the 'Big Three'; the other two being Elinor Brent-Dyer and Dorita Fairlie Bruce. Although Angela Brazil is the first name to come to mind for non-specialists, she did not create long series as the other three did, and in terms of collecting and interest Brazil is less popular than they are. Oxenham was not the most prolific of these three, as she had 87 titles published during her lifetime (and a further two were published by her niece, who discovered the manuscripts among Oxenham's papers in the 1990s) whereas Brent-Dyer published 100 books of various kinds.Sims & Clare, p. 73. Nearly forty of Oxenham's books comprise the main Abbey Series, with another thirty or so in several connecting series and the remaining twenty - some in small series of their own, and some isolated titles - having no connection with the Abbey books at all. During the 1920s to the 1950s she had several short stories, and some longer serialised ones, published in Annuals such as the Girl's Own Annual, British Girl's Annual, Little Folks and Hulton's Girls' Stories. Some of these stories were connected to the books - i.e. dealt with characters from one of her books or series - others became books, or sections of books, that were published a year or two later. =Reprinted titles= Collins reprinted most of the Oxenham titles that they had published in various of their publishing series, in particular the main titles in the Abbey Series which were produced in several different formats. Her other publishers did so less often, if at all, though a few titles had one or two reissues. This is why the non-Collins books are normally rarer - and consequently more expensive for the collector. Several books have more recently been reprinted by Girls Gone By Publishers, who are planning eventually to republish all the main Abbey titles. Elsie Oxenham's first book was Goblin Island, published in 1907. This was reprinted in October 2007 by GGBP as a centenary edition, with all the known illustrations from every edition, a new introduction, and a full publishing history. Goblin Island became the first in the so-called Scottish Sequence of six titles, four of which are set largely in Scotland: Goblin Island itself, set on 'Loch Avie', a fictionalised Loch Lomond; Princess in Tatters, set on 'Loch Ruel', which may be Loch Fyne; A Holiday Queen, set at 'Morven' on what appears to be Loch Long; and Schoolgirls and Scouts set at 'Glenleny', which also seems to be on Loch Long, but a bit further up the loch. Of the other two in the series, Twins of Castle Charming - perhaps Oxenham's rarest title - is set largely in Switzerland, whereas Finding Her Family has some early scenes set in Ealing and mainly takes place in Saltburn. From 2012, the EJO Society have been reprinting the titles originally published by Chambers and Muller, thanks to permission granted by EJO's niece. Girls of the Hamlet Club, Biddy's Secret, Joy's New Adventure, Rosaly's New School, Abbey Champion, Two Form Captains, Maidlin to the Rescue, Captain of the Fifth, Fiddler for the Abbey, The Junior Captain, Guardians of the Abbey, The School Without a Name, Ven at Gregory's and Rosamund's Victory, have already been published. A School Camp Fire and Rachel in the Abbey are the next titles projected, for 2018. =Appreciation societies= Elsie Jeanette Oxenham Appreciation Society (UK) The UK EJO Society was founded in 1989 as a \\"postal meeting place\\" for all who collect the books of Elsie J. Oxenham and are interested in her work. Its magazine The Abbey Chronicle is published three times a year and contains articles about the author, her books, the real places used as settings for the books, the originals of characters within the books, and reports of meetings held by members. One of the interests of collectors and EJO Society members is finding and visiting the original sites used by Oxenham in her books. As well as the Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire area which is the background for Girls of the Hamlet Club and the village of Washford, Somerset where Cleeve Abbey is situated, Oxenham used parts of Sussex, Wales, Lancashire, the English Lake District and Scotland for the settings of several books. The UK Society holds a biennial meeting at Halsway Manor in the summer, which includes folk-dancing and tours of nearby Cleeve Abbey as if it were the fictional one. These places are not always depicted in the books exactly as the real sites; Oxenham was writing fiction, and given that she could move an abbey several hundred miles for her purposes, changing a few names and telescoping or stretching distances was also well within her remit. Abbey Girls of Australia The Australian society, The Abbey Girls of Australia, has been in existence since 1985; its motto is 'Bound in Friendship'. It produces a magazine, The Abbey Guardian. There are official branches in several states of Australia. Regular meetings take place, and weekend 'Camps' are held every two or three years to gather people from further afield. May Queen coronations are often held as part of the meetings and camps, but book discussions and general chats are more usual in the less formal meetings. New Zealand New Zealand's Society was founded at about the same time as the British one; its magazine is called The Abbey Gatehouse and the motto is 'Gate Open Be' - a quote from the Abbey books.There is a carved plaque on the gatehouse at Cleeve Abbey which shows the Latin, 'Porta patens esto nulli claudens honesto', which Oxenham translates in several books as 'Gate open be, to honest folk all free.' At the moment there is no web page available for the New Zealand Society. Rest of the World In both South Africa and North America there are groups who meet regularly, but they do not produce their own magazines. Members of the groups receive the magazines which do exist, normally each subscribing to one of the three, as well as magazines for other author interest societies, as a means of sharing them among the rest of the group. =Seat at Cleeve Abbey= In 1995 the EJO Societies worldwide held a collection to provide a seat at Cleeve Abbey as a recognition of the inspiration that the author received by her visits to the Abbey, and her collection of photographs of the site. In summer it is usually placed against the outer wall of the west range to overlook the gatehouse meadow. The plaque on the seat reads: > IN MEMORY OF > ELSIE JEANETTE OXENHAM (1880-1960) > WHOSE VISITS TO CLEEVE ABBEY > INSPIRED HER ABBEY BOOKS > GIVEN BY MEMBERS OF THE WORLD-WIDE > ELSIE OXENHAM SOCIETIES References Bibliography   * Mary Cadogan, 'Dunkerley, Elsie Jeanette (1880‚Äì1960)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 , accessed 24 Feb 2007 (needs log-in) External links The Elsie J.

At the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864, he was among the crew of a small boat sent from Metacomet to rescue survivors of , which had been sunk by a naval mine (then known as a \\"torpedo\\"). Despite intense fire, the boat crew was able to pull ten Tecumseh men from the water. For this action, Avery was awarded the Medal of Honor a year and a half later, on January 15, 1866. Five other members of the Metacomet boat crew also received the medal: Quarter Gunner Charles Baker, Ordinary Seaman John C.

Many years after the war Avery was serving as a berth-deck cook and it was discovered by the captain that he had won a medal of honor. When asked about the medal he said: \\"That can tell you more about it than I can. I did like the rest of the men that day, and I never expected anything more than my pay and rations. We tried to do our duty, and when we saw the men in the other ship being shot down and some drowning, we could only try to help them. God knows it was hard to see them being murdered without much chance for escape\\" This incident was reported in the New York Times on January 16, 1898. Avery later served in one of the bureaus of the Navy Department. He died on October 11, 1898 and is buried in Captain Ted Conaway Memorial Naval Cemetery Portsmouth, Virginia.

Due to the dependence of industrialized society on cheap and readily available petroleum (fossil fuel oil), Heinberg argues that the post-peak period of global history is likely to be characterized by social and economic turmoil, disruption of trade, declining standard of living, and warfare. Heinberg outlines four possible strategies nations could employ to respond to the economic challenges associated with declining oil production: * Last One Standing: Global competition for remaining resources * Powerdown: Global cooperation in reducing energy usage, conservation, resource management, and reducing population * Denial: Waiting, and hoping that some unforeseen element will solve the problem * Building Lifeboats: Preparing local areas to be sustainable in the event that the global economic project collapses Heinberg fleshes out each of these strategies in detail and describes the current political and economic environment in terms of these elements.

The first ever \\"Festival of the Tableland\\", was held in Herberton on 8 May and 9 May 1981. It then moved to Yungaburra in 1982, where it has been held ever since. Various individuals and groups - including locals, the Cairns Folk Club and the Townsville Folk Club - ran the Festival for the next 11 years. Since 1994, the Festival has been organised by a committee of North Queenslanders. The festival celebrates world-wide folk traditions through music, storytelling, circus, dance, and crafts, and features musicians, dancers, circus and fire artists, comedians and festival performers. Yungaburra is surrounded by World Heritage rainforests, lakes, waterfalls and Queensland's tallest mountain, Mount Bartle Frere. Festival Name Change From 2010, the festival will be called: Tablelands Folk Festival. This development means the festival celebrates its 30th anniversary in 2010 with the first Folk Festival held on the Tablelands in 1981 at Herberton. The Festival was called the Tablelands Folk Festival (TFF) for 21 years, the name was then changed to Yungaburra Folk Festival (YFF) for 8 years. The membership voted to return to the former name in February 2010. The members of TFF Assn. Inc. have always been the organising team behind the Yungaburra Folk Festival. The TFF Members‚Äô post-festival analysis and plenary session of November 2007 led to an awareness of the need to plan for the longer term, within the TFF Objects and Mission Statement. This development allows for future events at locations around the Tablelands region, and provides an avenue to umbrella periodic events, showcase performances, bush dances or other festivals. Confusion amongst the public was apparent in 2009, with the Yungaburra Folk Festival presenting the Thursday night anniversary concert at Herberton. The change of name will alleviate such issues.

By mid-2008, the chain operated 276 stores in 39 states. The company was headquartered in Port Washington, New York. The company liquidated all of its stores throughout 2008 and 2009. The chain's origin was based on various university campuses across the United States. Until 2007, it was called Steve & Barry's University Sportswear, and the chain specialized in college-related clothing and private-label casual clothing. The chain dropped the \\"University Sportswear\\" tagline after securing licensing agreements with several celebrities to develop and distribute private-label lines of clothing designed or inspired by each of them, in an attempt to expand the chain's customer base.  History  Steve & Barry's store, a former Mervyn's, at West Oaks Mall, Houston, Texas, demolished in 2011 for Edwards Theaters Founded by Steven Shore and Barry Prevor at the University of Pennsylvania in 1985 while Prevor was an undergraduate student, Steve & Barry's became a local popular destination due to its low prices compared to other university bookstores and gift stores. The success of the original store led to the opening of locations on university campuses, including Michigan State University, the University of Michigan, the University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Indiana University, Rutgers University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Purdue University. In 1998, Steve & Barry's opened its first large mall-based store at Great Lakes Crossing in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The new line of products included denim, business casual, active wear, outerwear, footwear and T-shirts. In addition, the company began marketing \\"All-American\\" brands such as Hershey's, Marvel Comics, Ford, WWE, My Little Pony, Monopoly, and General Mills cereals, amongst others. The continuing product line expansion and store growth allowed the company to achieve a 50% annual growth rate over more than two decades. The International Council of Shopping Centers named Steve & Barry‚Äôs as the ‚ÄúHot Retailer of the Year‚Äù in 2005, along with Apple Computer and Williams- Sonoma, for generating the most mall traffic and cachet. Brandweek named Steve & Barry‚Äôs 2007 Marketer of the Year. The Company‚Äôs in-house video productions won a 2007 Silver Telly Award for distinction in creative work. By 2007, Steve & Barry‚Äôs was ranked in the 400 largest private companies in America by Forbes Magazine. Founders Steve Shore and Barry Prevor were awarded the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for 2006 in a metropolitan New York Area 20th anniversary event with more than 500 people in attendance. For several years, the company was the fastest growing specialty retailer in the United States, adding of new retail space in 2005, of new retail space in 2006, and of new retail space in 2007; more than the combined total of specialty clothing competitors Gap (Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy), Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters, and Pacific Sunwear. Steve & Barry's was among the top 10 builders of new square footage among all retailers in the United States when including big-box chains like Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, Walgreens, Costco, etc. In 2006, private equity firm TA Associates closed a minority investment in the company for an undisclosed amount. A group of investment firms led by Bay Harbour Management, former owner of Barney‚Äôs New York luxury department store chain, later purchased the company for $168 million. In early 2008, GE Commercial Finance Corporate Lending provided a $197 million asset- based credit facility to the company, for working capital to replace Steve & Barry's credit facility from the CIT Group. On July 9, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, citing a liquidity squeeze and the economic downturn, while in discussions with potential strategic and financial partners for a stronger Steve & Barry's to emerge. While initial results were promising, reorganization efforts ultimately failed, and successor parent company BH S&B; Holdings announced the liquidation of its 173 remaining stores at the height of the credit crisis on November 27, 2008, which later converted the Chapter 11 reorganization into a Chapter 7 liquidation.  Celebrity lines  In 2006, the chain announced its partnership with NBA point guard Stephon Marbury, a joint venture in which the chain would produce Marbury's Starbury Collection, a 50-item line of discount clothing, athletic clothing, and sneakers. The centerpiece of the line was the Starbury One, a basketball sneaker that retailed for $14.98. The low price point for an authentic on- court NBA shoe was positioned as a social statement, including donations of thousands of pairs to public school basketball players, with publicity that caused lines and sold-out conditions at many Steve & Barry‚Äôs stores. Marbury liked the high-quality, low price-point promise, which, as he later said, meant \\"we can help teach kids to be responsible, earn their own money and buy these shoes without asking their parents for money.\\" When the collection was unveiled in August 2006, Marbury committed his time and energy by handing out Starburys to high school athletes at basketball camps, on playground courts and in barber shops. He wore on-court exactly the same shoes that consumers got off the shelves. In March 2007, the company announced that then Chicago Bulls center, and 4-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Ben Wallace, would endorse the Starbury brand, wearing Starbury's during all his games and debuting his own Big Ben Starbury sneaker in the 2007-08 NBA season. Similarly, Sarah Jessica Parker introduced her own clothing line, BITTEN, on June 7, 2007. The brand was originally leaked to the press during an early fashion show in March 2007. The Bitten name came from the phrase that one who becomes an actor has been \\"Bitten\\" by the acting bug. After an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, the brand launched in early June 2007, with roughly 400 pieces of clothing that was reported to grow to 500 or more by the fall. The line achieved significant commercial and critical success. Sarah Jessica Parker stated that growing up with her sister's hand-me-downs inspired her to do something so affordable, explaining \\"It‚Äôs a way of giving women without financial means access to good, simple, well-made clothes to feel proud of.\\" The Project Runway reality television series, with Sarah Jessica Parker as guest judge, went on to design clothing which was sold exclusively at Steve & Barry's stores. Announced during the summer of 2007, former Nickelodeon star Amanda Bynes also debuted a clothing line, Dear, on August 16, 2007. Similar to the Bitten line, Dear was a women's brand that appealed mostly to younger women.} Steve & Barry's signed tennis star Venus Williams to market her own clothing and sneakers line called EleVen. Likewise, American golfer Bubba Watson had his own clothing line called \\"Bubba Golf\\". On May 15, 2008, the company debuted big-wave surfer Laird Hamilton's \\"Wonderwall\\" collection with a surfing expo around New York's Statue of Liberty. The collection featured men's clothing themed around surfing, skating, and the outdoors, utilizing the tagline \\"Every man is equal before the wave\\". Hamilton grew up in Hawaii with a single mom and not a lot of money, and he stated that he teamed with Steve & Barry's because he understood the pressures and wanted his line to speak to teens who haven't had access to hip clothes because of their economic status. American singer Ciara, who was at the time the face of rap mogul Jay-Z's 'Rocawear' clothing line, unveiled plans to launch her own fashion line with Steve & Barry's in 2008.  Business model  The company was a proponent of \\"Extreme Value Retailing\\", generally offering every item in the store at a single price point of $5.98 to $9.98, varying with seasonal offerings. Some high value celebrity endorsed items were sometimes sold for slightly higher prices up to a maximum of $19.98. Shore and Prevor discussed their methods for keeping prices down. Steve & Barry's business model was to keep prices low by not advertising through traditional streams, relying on publicity and viral marketing to get the word out, running its company and stores very efficiently, selling in large volumes, and making modest profits on each item. It also sourced clothing progressively, meaning it purchases product from a wide variety of manufacturers at different times throughout the year. The bidding between manufacturers allowed the buyer to purchase at a lower per unit cost than larger retailers who frequently have standing contracts with suppliers. The company‚Äôs low prices and exclusive product lines drew significant traffic and cachet, helping to draw shoppers to smaller retailers in the same shopping complex. The company often opened retail locations in economically-challenged areas with household-income levels, crime rates and population trends that caused other retailers to abandon the neighborhood. Individual store sizes of 25,000 to 150,000 square feet made the retailer a mall‚Äôs anchor store, allowing the company to negotiate low rents and large cash inducements.  Financial problems and bankruptcy plan  As of June 21, 2008, the company was deficient in paying a $135.9 million balance outstanding to a General Electric Commercial lending unit. The firm filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 on July 9, 2008. All stores were to remain open with the store's return policy, store credit, and gift cards unchanged. Founders and co-Chief Executives Steve Shore and Barry Prevor cited liquidity concerns and the generally harsh conditions for retailers in recent months. The Associated Press reported that Steve & Barry's was considering a plan to sell all or some of its assets to repay its outstanding debt. Steve & Barry's was also in talks with Sears Holdings Corporation for a possible acquisition. It was reported that Sears might have been interested in buying some or all of Steve & Barry's brands, or that Sears Holdings could open Steve & Barry's store-within-a-store areas in its Sears or Kmart locations.Sears Holdings Corp. News  Chicago Business News, Analysis & Articles  Sears talks of Steve & Barry's bailout: reports  Crain's On August 21, 2008, Steve & Barry's announced that BH S&B; Holdings LLC, a newly formed affiliate of investment firm Bay Harbour Management L.C., agreed to acquire certain assets of Steve & Barry's. In addition to acquiring merchandise inventories and transfer rights to Steve & Barry's store leases, BH S&B; Holdings would acquire all Steve & Barry's intellectual property rights, including its celebrity and brand licenses, and the company's key facilities, including its Port Washington, New York headquarters, Columbus, Ohio distribution center, and certain overseas offices. Bay Harbour planned to keep open about 150 of the chain's 276 stores, and brought Hal Kahn, chairman and CEO of Macy's East, on board as the new CEO.http://www.wwd.com/retail-news/hal-kahn-to-head-steve-barrys-1837024// Bankruptcy documents revealed 2008 annual sales of $1.1 billion and assets of $693 million. Total sales in 2008 increased by approximately 70% from prior year sales, with average sales per store increasing by 25%. Reorganization efforts failed, with court filings stating that revenue suffered because of the declining health of the U.S. economy and the slump in the retail market. On November 20, 2008, after closing many stores, Steve and Barry's parent company announced the remaining 176 stores would be liquidated by early 2009 and the chain was going out of business. The New York Post reported on Mar. 31, 2010 that Ex-New York Knicks player Stephon Marbury was sued by a sports marketing agency claiming he owes more than $200,000 in commissions for helping create a line of sportswear which was distributed through Steve & Barry's retail stores.

Caterpillars of most Acronicta species are unmistakable, with brightly colored hairy spikes, and often feed quite visibly on common foliate trees. The hairy spikes may contain poison, which cause itchy, painful, swollen rash in humans on contact. The larva of the smeared dagger moth (A. oblinita) is unusually hairy even for this genus. Acronicta species are generally known as dagger moths, as most have one or more black dagger-shaped markings on their forewing uppersides. But some species have a conspicuous dark ring marking instead. Description Its eyes are naked and without eyelashes. The proboscis is fully developed. Antennae are simple in both sexes. Thorax and abdomen tuftless. Abdomen with long coarse hair on the dorsal part of proximal segments. Legs spineless. Forewings with non-crenulate cilia. Inner margin slightly lobed towards base.

It was launched in December 2004. Initially, it was only available on the Canal Digital satellite platform, but was launched on cable platforms, including Com Hem, later on. During its first full year, the channel had average ratings of 0,0 minutes per day and person (Mediam√§tning i Skandinavien). In February 2006, the Swedish government announced that the channel had received a license to broadcast unencrypted in the digital terrestrial network between 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The channel timeshares with ONE Television that broadcast between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Terrestrial broadcasting started in late May 2006. In February 2007, ONE Television was replaced by Kanal 9, which wanted to broadcast during other times than ONE Television did. The timeshare was altered so that Kanal 9 would broadcast from 5.40 p.m. to 5.40 a.m. on weekdays and from 2.30 p.m. to 2.30 a.m. on weekends, while The Voice TV would broadcast during the remaining time. During the channel's second full year, 2006, the ratings had increased slightly to 0,2 minutes per day and person. In 2007, it was viewed 0,3 minutes per day. In March 2008, The Voice TV received a new broadcast license running from 1 April 2008. The license stipulated that starting on 1 January 2009, The Voice TV would broadcast around the clock. This would be done using a new transmitter network that would use H.264 compression. In early September 2008 it was announced that The Voice TV would be closed down on 30 September. This was mostly because the channel would move to a new transmitter network. At the time, this network hadn't been built and few of the set-top-boxes on the market would be able to receive its broadcasts. On 8 September 2008 The Voice TV ended its transmissions in the terrestrial network. The programming consisted mainly of music videos and the channel is linked to the radio network The Voice Hiphop & RnB Sweden.

The organisation's stated aims are \\"promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths\\".From the 'Main aims of Peace Mala' Mala in Hinduism and Sikhism is a string of prayer beads. History Peace Mala was founded in 2002 by Pam Evans, former Head of the Department of Religious Studies at Coedcae Comprehensive School in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, Wales. The idea arose from class discussions about the contribution of the \\"9/11\\" attacks in New York to Islamophobia, racism, religious intolerance and fundamentalism worldwide, as well as local effects exemplified by the experience of the student Imran Sheikh: \\"I suffered from racist taunts and our local mosque was attacked following September 11 and that is when the Peace Mala all started.\\"Word spreads of 'peace mala', BBC Wales interview upon winning first prize in the ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) initiative. In 2005 Evans gave up her position as Head of Department at Coedcae School to focus on her work with Peace Mala. On 16 November 2006, (25th Shawwal 1427 AH), Evans was awarded the Noble Soul Award 2006 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to challenging Islamophobia in schools. The award was presented by RAHMA (Racial Attacks and Harassment Monitoring Association) on the International Day of Peace. =Launch= Peace Mala was officially launched in the UNA Temple of Peace in Cardiff on Wednesday 27 November 2002 by Archbishop of Wales Rowan Williams (later Archbishop of Canterbury). He was joined by members of the fourteen faiths represented on the Peace Mala bracelet, whose procession opened the ceremony, along with NGOs, students and teachers of schools from across Wales, lecturers from the University of Wales, and pupils and staff of Coedcae Comprehensive School. =Awards= Through the promotion of peace, tolerance and respect, Peace Mala has received numerous awards for their work, notably The Prince's Trust Millennium Award in 2003, the Co-op Community Dividend Award in 2003, the ChildLine Cymru CHIPS Friendship and Respect Award in 2003 (1st Prize), and the Carmarthenshire Police Community Challenge Award in 2004. In 2004 Peace Mala was also awarded First Prize in the CEWC-Cymru \\"Right-On\\" National Competition to promote Human Rights in Welsh schools. In 2006 Peace Mala was awarded a grant by Awards for All (Wales) in support of the Peace Mala Awards for Youth. In 2007, Peace Mala was awarded the Community Development Foundation Award. Peace Mala was awarded the Unboxed Award for excellence in positive activities for young people that maximize youth participation, empowerment and potential, and was presented by the City of London Parochial Foundation in 2008. The Corus Community Award from Tata Steel was awarded to Peace Mala in 2009 and 2010. Charitable status On 21 February 2007, Peace Mala, already a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital, was entered in the Central Register of Charities as Registered Charity No. 1118053. Patrons Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, was patron of Peace Mala from 2003 until 2008, and was succeeded by Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director of the Yundrung B√∂n Study Centre. =Rowan Williams= Williams and Evans first met when he visited Coedcae School to give talks to the pupils about his work as Archbishop of Wales, a position now held by Barry Morgan. Williams was one of the first persons to be contacted by Evans when she came up with the idea of the Peace Mala. One of Williams's final acts as Archbishop of Wales was to join 14 other religious dignitaries in the launch of the Peace Mala in November 2002. In 2003 Evans invited Williams to be a patron; he held the position until 2008. =Lama Khemsar Rinpoche= Lama Khemsar Rinpoche also visited Coedcae School prior to his involvement with Peace Mala. Rinpoche left Tibet in 1959, and is the first resident Lama of the Yungdrung B√∂n tradition in Europe. He also teaches widely in the US. Evans invited Lama Khemsar Rinpoche to be a patron of the organisation, and he accepted. Since then, Lama Khemsar Rinpoche's students have made use of the main room in the Peace Mala Registered Office for their weekly B√∂n Zogchen Ng√∂ndro prayers and meditations. The Tibetan room at the centre is often used by Rinpoche when he visits Wales. The Peace Mala bracelet A Peace Mala is a symbolic bracelet used to promote the message of the Golden Rule of mutual respect recognised by many spiritual paths. It consists of 16 beads, forming a double rainbow, which represent Christianity, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Judaism, Bah√° º√≠, ISKCON, Zoroastrianism, Tribal and Native Religions, Jainism, Earth religions, Taoism, Hinduism and Yungdrung B√∂n. The central white bead represents the wearer and whatever path they follow, with two knots on the elastic thread: one symbolising the wearer's uniqueness, the other a reminder of causality and the path of peace and friendship to follow.Official description of the symbology and representations Website The Peace Mala website was created in 2002 using money granted by the Princes Trust Millennium Award. It was designed and published using 100% solar power by the web publishing company Arcania. The website includes news articles relating to Peace Mala activities and endorsements from prominent religious leaders, political dignitaries and celebrities including the Pope John Paul II, the 14th Dalai Lama, Jillian Evans MEP, Sir Mark Tully Beth Nielsen Chapman, Bonnie Tyler and Barbara Dickson. Registered office On Wednesday 18 August 2004, the Peace Mala Registered Office was officially opened during a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor and Consort of the City of Swansea. The registered office is used as a base for Peace Mala activities including workshops and public talks. Yungdrung B√∂n practitioners in Wales also use the centre for their weekly Bon Zogchen Ngon-Dro prayers and meditations. Yungdrung B√∂n (meaning Eternal Light or Enlightened Teaching) is the pre-Buddhist B√∂n faith of Tibet. =Peace Garden= Attached to the registered office is a peace garden with many features including a shrine to Saint Francis of Assisi, Buddhist statues and prayer flags, a miniature Zen-style stone garden, water features, and a tree area which has been blessed in a ceremony led by Witches, and Druids. There is also a tranquil area facing Mecca, which is dedicated to the Muslim faith. Aims Peace Mala outlined its \\"Main Aims\\" as: *Education for global citizenship through the promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths. *Peace Mala supports human rights, confronts bullying and all forms of prejudice. *Peace Mala raises awareness of issues of global interdependence and encourages active compassion by learners that will effect positive changes locally and globally. Educational work Peace Mala works to engages with schools to educate youths into becoming \\"global citizens through the promotion of respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities and faiths\\".Brown, Alex, \\"Youngsters honoured for promoting peace\\", South Wales Evening Post, 22 September 2009 =International Awards for Youth= In 2006 Peace Mala launched the Peace Mala Awards for Youth. The awards and competition encourage young people \\"... to become aware of and involved with issues of peace, justice, tolerance and friendship.\\".Peace Mala, PEACE MALA NATIONAL AWARDS FOR YOUTH Award Winners 2006 . Retrieved 18 April 2013 The competition focuses in issues of equality, human rights and global citizenship.\\"Peace Mala International Youth Awards\\", Positive News, 17 October 2007. Retrieved 18 April 2013 The Youth Awards allows entrants from educational institutions, youth groups and faith groups. Two prizes are awarded: one for juniors (5‚Äì11) and the other for seniors (12‚Äì18). The awards were accompanied by cash prizes, and occasionally donated gifts such as commemorative framed posters signed by Gary Marlon Suson from the Ground Zero Museum Workshop. In 2007 the Peace Mala Awards for Youth became an international competition with youth groups in the USA taking part in the project.Byrne, Kay, \\"Peace hopes win top prize\\", South Wales Evening Post, 27 July 2013 In 2009 the Awards were superseded by the Peace Mala Accreditation. =Accreditation for Schools, Youth Groups and Community Groups= In September 2009 Peace Mala celebrated the last Youth Awards ceremony, where the Awards were replaced an accreditation for schools, youth groups and community groups. As the Awards had focused on competitive engagement by schools and some youth groups, the accreditation would be more cooperative and inclusive. Schools and groups are encouraged to include the vision and objectives of Peace Mala within their ethos via the seven criteria and accreditation is awarded when the seven criteria have been successfully fulfilled as outlined in the self-assessment form available to applicants. These seven areas are intended to fit into the school, youth group or community group's values system and are in line with the objectives and vision of Peace Mala. Applicants for accreditation are judged against seven key criteria: # Community cohesion and global citizenship # Needs and human rights # Interdependence # Active compassion # Celebrating diversity # Environmental responsibilities and sustainable change # Conflict resolution and peace education Interfaith engagement Along with education and youth engagement, with the religious nature of its founding, Peace Mala engages regularly with interfaith and diversity engagement and occasions. Awareness events and fundraisers are regular occurrences. =Pilgrimages= Pilgrimages have been used by Peace Mala as a means of promotion, but also as a means to engage communities in interfaith involvement and raise awareness of local areas of interest and community diversity. Santiago de Compostela Gower In May 2011, volunteers discovered a route map which may have been a pilgrimage path linking the Celtic churches of the Gower Peninsula, as well pre-Christian sites such as holy wells and cromlech stones. A pilgrimage was organised, therefore, the next year to celebrate Peace Mala's first decennial year. The pilgrimage included one pilgrim who was joined at different legs of the pilgrimage culminating in a ceremony at St. Rhidian's Church in Llanrhidian. For the pilgrimage, Pam Evans travelled to Kildare to receive the flame of Brigid of the Brigidine Sisters of the Solas Bhr√≠de hermitage; she then received the World Peace Flame at the Dru International Training Centre for Education and Wellbeing in Snowdonia National Park; finally, various faith representatives attended a ceremony where a flame was blessed at the shrine of St David at St David's Cathedral by The Very Revd Jonathan Lean. These three flames were used during the start of the pilgrimage, where the lights were blessed by The Rt Revd John Davies, Bishop of Swansea and Brecon; as well as at the end, where the flames were blessed by numerous faith representatives including Muslim, Druid and Buddhists, as well as ISKCON sannyasa who greeted the pilgrims with kirtan. At each of the sites visited, the main pilgrim lit votive candles and recited a prayer composed for the pilgrimage. She was joined on various days by school children as well as fellow pilgrims.\\"Pilgrims step out on peace walk\\", South Wales Evening Post, 26 July 2012 Llangyfelach \\"Forgotten\\" Monastery On Thursday 9 May 2013, Ascension Day, Peace Mala led a one-day pilgrimage as means of a revival of a postulated pilgrimage route to a now-defunct early Celtic monastery founded by St David on the site of the current parish Church of St David and St Cyfelach in Llangyfelach.Lewis, Paul, \\"Old tradition revived by pilgrimage\\", South Wales Evening Post, 10 May 2013 The participants in the pilgrimage included pupil from St John Lloyd Catholic School in Llanelli, Hafod Primary School in Swansea and Catwg Primary School. Also in procession were dignitaries from numerous faith, including The Rt Rev'd John Davies, Bishop of Swansea and Brecon, as well as representatives from the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University, the Catholic Church, Anglican Communion and Kagyu Tibetan Buddhism among many others.Evans, Pam, \\"Peace Mala Pilgrimage to Saint David's Forgotten Monastery\\", Diocesan News: The Diocese of Swansea & Brecon , Issue ‚Ññ 18, June 2013 Travelling Doves of Peace Peace Mala released 14 small symbolic doves made from wood painted in the Peace Mala colours and each carrying a Peace Mala bracelet (along with other items) during a ceremony that took place in the Peace Mala peace garden on 30 April 2015. The Deputy Lord Mayor of the City and County of Swansea, the Mayor and Mayoress of Neath Port Talbot, Regional Chief of Police, Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia, representatives of several faith communities and pupils and teachers from some of Peace Mala Accredited schools were all in attendance. The founder aims that as the Doves of Peace (also known as 'Peace Doves') travel the UK and across the world, they will raise awareness of the work of Peace Mala with schools, youth groups and community groups. Within the first few months after the launch, three of the doves travelled to the USA, Ireland, Holland, Italy, Cyprus, Israel, Africa, Hong Kong and Japan. The journeys of the 14 doves are being tracked to provide a geography project for schools and youth groups. This information is published on Facebook, Twitter and our interactive world maps for people to follow online. Dove 13 in Jerusalem Each dove is being sponsored on its travels, thereby also bringing financial support and security for the future work of the Peace Mala educational charity. One doves in particular, number 13, is known as the Inter-Faith Dove of Peace. Information on how to sponsor the doves is available on the Peace Mala website. =Festival of Interfaith and Culture for Education= The Peace Mala Festival of Inter-Faith and Culture for Education was held at the award-winning, beautifully restored setting of The Monastery Manchester in Gorton on 4 October 2010. The festival was organised by Laura Daniels, Head Teacher of Woodheys Primary School in Sale Greater Manchester, one of the first accredited schools in the UK. Daniels came on board as an educational ambassador for Peace Mala in 2008. The festival brought together Peace Mala with the Greater Manchester Authorities and representatives of local Faith and Peace groups to celebrate humanity, unity and diversity. Messages of support came from the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Archbishop of Wales and the former Bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East. Other support was shown by organisations including One World Week, The Interfaith Foundation, Spiritual England, Trafford CYPS and Redeeming Our Communities Manchester. Many schools, cultural communities and representatives of faith communities took part. Guest of honour and main speaker was Terry Waite CBE. =Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales= On 10 June 2010 the founder of Peace Mala was honoured with the Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales. This award was first introduced by the Welsh Assembly Government in 2009. The 2010 Award for Promoting Tolerance was carefully selected to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of the death camps in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Evans received this honour from the First Minister Carwyn Jones AM in recognition of her work with Peace Mala and her positive stand against all forms of inequality and intolerance. Peace Mala units at Primary and Secondary level included in the new Religious Education Agreed Syllabus for Trafford Education Authority UK On Wednesday 9 February 2011, the founder was invited to take part in a full day of meetings with Trafford Education Authority to discuss the inclusion of Peace Mala units at primary and secondary level for the new RE Agreed Syllabus. This proved highly successful with ideas being shared between teachers and RE advisors including Steve Illingworth (Independent Educational Consultant and Education Link Officer to Salford SACRE) and Erica Pounce, School Improvement Partner and Link Advisor for Primary Education. Pounce reported that they had worked as a Collaborative with other Greater Manchester SACREs but had also developed a distinctive local flavour, which is where the Peace Mala Units would sit as an optional unit and as an example of a compelling learning experience. The New RE syllabus for Trafford Education Authority, including units on Peace Mala, was launched on 24 March 2011. = Queen's Birthday Honours = In the Queen's Birthday Honours for 2019, Pam Evans, founder of Peace Mala, received an MBE for services to the promotion of peace and interfaith understanding. =International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace, Llandaff 2017= In July 2017 the Peace Mala International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace took place at Llandaff Cathedral Wales. This major event took almost two years to organise and plan. The idea came to the founder after the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday 13 the November 2015. The founder felt urged to bring the Peace Mala community together and Llandaff Cathedral immediately sprang to mind as a venue for this. She also felt it was time to put the spotlight on the work being achieved by the children and young people in Peace Mala schools. The purpose would be to send out a message of love, friendship and peace to all people in our world. Representatives from sixteen religions, including three Christian Bishops, and supporters from across the UK and beyond attended and took part. These included dignitaries from Cardiff, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Greater Manchester and Peace Mala schools from across Wales, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The cathedral was filled to capacity and turned out to be the largest interfaith gathering for world peace that Wales had hosted. =Apostolic Blessing for Peace Mala from Pope Francis, September 2017= On 21 September 2017, Peace Mala celebrated the UN International Day of Peace at St Joseph‚Äôs Catholic Cathedral in Swansea Wales UK. This was thanks to the invitation of Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia and the support of the Dean, Rev. Fr. Benedict Koledoye. Seven schools attended and took part in the Peace Mala Youth Liturgy for World Peace. Peace Mala linked up with One Day one Choir, a global peace initiative which uses the harmonious power of singing together to unite people around the world on Peace Day. Peace Mala schools that could not be present at the event sang the Peace Mala Anthem, ‚ÄòOne Light‚Äô in their school assemblies across the UK. Lee Michael Walton, composer of the anthem, drove from London and back to accompany the children‚Äôs singing on St Joseph‚Äôs Cathedral organ. When it came to the final prayer and blessing from Bishop Tom, he surprised the congregation with an Apostolic Blessing from Pope Francis, \\"His Holiness Pope Francis presents his good wishes to Pam Evans and to all those persons involved in Peace Mala and imparts to them the requested Apostolic Blessing upon their work for world peace and encourages them with his prayers.\\" This message and blessing which has a seal signed by the Apostolic Nuncio, is now on the office wall of Peace Mala HQ in Swansea. =Youth Liturgy for World Peace, St David's Church Neath 2018= Peace Mala worked with St David's Church in Neath to host a Youth Liturgy for World Peace on the UN International Day of Peace on 21 September 2018 . Peace Mala accredited schools and those working towards accreditation were joined by local dignitaries and 21 representatives from eleven different faiths. = International Interfaith Liturgy For World Peace, Brecon Cathedral September 2019 = On 16 September 2019, Peace Mala celebrated the UN International Day of Peace at Brecon Cathedral in South Wales. Peace Mala schools from Wales and Greater Manchester were present at the event, as were dignitaries from South Wales and Powys. Faith representatives came to Brecon from across the UK. The event also linked up with One Day One Choir, with schoolchildren attending the event singing the Peace Mala anthem 'One Light' with West End star and supporter of Peace Mala, Steve Balsamo, and Peace Mala's Director of Music, Lee Michael Walton. Dance also played an important part in the event, with a Native American Hoop Dance being performed. During the service the Peace Mala Doves of Peace were re-blessed with incense and holy water by the Archbishop of Wales and Bishop Emeritus Tom Burns of Menevia. = World Peace Mala Festival, St David's, Pembrokeshire, June 17th-19th 2020 = To coincide with the 900th anniversary of St David's canonisation, Peace Mala was invited by the Diocese of St David to take our interfaith World Peace Ceremony to the cathedral in 2020. After initial meetings with the Education and Pilgrimage Officer, Director of Education for the Diocese, the Diocese Schools Liaison Officer, and the Dean of the Cathedral, plans are now in place not only for an interfaith ceremony in the cathedral, but a week-long festival celebrating diversity, culture, art, music, international food, and community cohesion for peace.

So equivalently, a factor-critical graph is a graph in which there are near-perfect matchings that avoid every possible vertex. Examples Three friendship graphs, examples of non-Hamiltonian factor- critical graphs The gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid, a claw-free factor- critical graph Any odd-length cycle graph is factor-critical, as is any complete graph with an odd number of vertices. More generally, every Hamiltonian graph with an odd number of vertices is factor-critical. The friendship graphs (graphs formed by connecting a collection of triangles at a single common vertex) provide examples of graphs that are factor-critical but not Hamiltonian. If a graph is factor-critical, then so is the Mycielskian of . For instance, the Gr√∂tzsch graph, the Mycielskian of a five-vertex cycle- graph, is factor-critical.. Every 2-vertex-connected claw-free graph with an odd number of vertices is factor-critical. For instance, the 11-vertex graph formed by removing a vertex from the regular icosahedron (the graph of the gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid) is both 2-connected and claw-free, so it is factor-critical. This result follows directly from the more fundamental theorem that every connected claw-free graph with an even number of vertices has a perfect matching.. Characterizations Factor-critical graphs may be characterized in several different ways, other than their definition as graphs in which each vertex deletion allows for a perfect matching: *Tibor Gallai proved that a graph is factor-critical if and only if it is connected and, for each node of the graph, there exists a maximum matching that does not include . It follows from these properties that the graph must have an odd number of vertices and that every maximum matching must match all but one vertex.. As cited by . *L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz proved that a graph is factor-critical if and only if it has an odd ear decomposition, a partition of its edges into a sequence of subgraphs, each of which is an odd-length path or cycle, with the first in the sequence being a cycle, each path in the sequence having both endpoints but no interior points on vertices in previous subgraphs, and each cycle other than the first in the sequence having exactly one vertex in previous subgraphs. For instance, the graph in the illustration may be partitioned in this way into a cycle of five edges and a path of three edges. In the case that a near-perfect matching of the factor-critical graph is also given, the ear decomposition can be chosen in such a way that each ear alternates between matched and unmatched edges. .. *A graph is also factor-critical if and only if it can be reduced to a single vertex by a sequence of contractions of odd- length cycles. Moreover, in this characterization, it is possible to choose each cycle in the sequence so that it contains the vertex formed by the contraction of the previous cycle.. For instance, if one contracts the ears of an ear decomposition, in the order given by the decomposition, then at the time each ear is contracted it forms an odd cycle, so the ear decomposition characterization may be used to find a sequence of odd cycles to contract. Conversely from a sequence of odd cycle contractions, each containing the vertex formed from the previous contraction, one may form an ear decomposition in which the ears are the sets of edges contracted in each step. *Suppose that a graph is given together with a choice of a vertex and a matching that covers all vertices other than . Then is factor-critical if and only if there is a set of paths in , alternating between matched and unmatched edges, that connect to each of the other vertices in . Based on this property, it is possible to determine in linear time whether a graph with a given near-perfect matching is factor-critical.. Properties Factor-critical graphs must always have an odd number of vertices, and must be 2-edge-connected (that is, they cannot have any bridges).. However, they are not necessarily 2-vertex- connected; the friendship graphs provide a counterexample. It is not possible for a factor-critical graph to be bipartite, because in a bipartite graph with a near-perfect matching, the only vertices that can be deleted to produce a perfectly matchable graph are the ones on the larger side of the bipartition. Every 2-vertex-connected factor-critical graph with edges has at least different near-perfect matchings, and more generally every factor-critical graph with edges and blocks (2-vertex-connected components) has at least different near-perfect matchings. The graphs for which these bounds are tight may be characterized by having odd ear decompositions of a specific form.. Any connected graph may be transformed into a factor-critical graph by contracting sufficiently many of its edges. The minimal sets of edges that need to be contracted to make a given graph factor-critical form the bases of a matroid, a fact that implies that a greedy algorithm may be used to find the minimum weight set of edges to contract to make a graph factor-critical, in polynomial time.. For an earlier algorithm for contracting the minimum number of (unweighted) edges to reach a factor-critical graph, see . Applications A blossom is a factor-critical subgraph of a larger graph. Blossoms play a key role in Jack Edmonds' algorithms for maximum matching and minimum weight perfect matching in non-bipartite graphs.. In polyhedral combinatorics, factor-critical graphs play an important role in describing facets of the matching polytope of a given graph. Generalizations and related concepts A graph is said to be -factor-critical if every subset of vertices has a perfect matching. Under this definition, a hypomatchable graph is 1-factor-critical.. Even more generally, a graph is -factor-critical if every subset of vertices has an -factor, that is, it is the vertex set of an -regular subgraph of the given graph. A critical graph (without qualification) is usually assumed to mean a graph for which removing each of its vertices reduces the number of colors it needs in a graph coloring. The concept of criticality has been used much more generally in graph theory to refer to graphs for which removing each possible vertex changes or does not change some relevant property of the graph. A matching-critical graph is a graph for which the removal of any vertex does not change the size of a maximum matching; by Gallai's characterization, the matching-critical graphs are exactly the graphs in which every connected component is factor-critical.. The complement graph of a critical graph is necessarily matching-critical, a fact that was used by Gallai to prove lower bounds on the number of vertices in a critical graph.. As cited by . Beyond graph theory, the concept of factor-criticality has been extended to matroids by defining a type of ear decomposition on matroids and defining a matroid to be factor-critical if it has an ear decomposition in which all ears are odd..

Early years Asia Frigga Booth was the eighth in the family of ten children born to Junius Brutus Booth and his wife Mary Ann Holmes. Her famous brothers were Junius Brutus Booth Jr., Edwin Thomas Booth, and John Wilkes Booth. Asia was named for the continent where her father thought the Garden of Eden had been located.Giblin, James Cross (2005). Good Brother, Bad Brother: The Story of Edwin Booth and John Wilkes Booth. Clarion Books. p. 7. Retrieved 2011-03-8. Career On April 28, 1859, Booth married John Sleeper Clarke at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, in Baltimore, Maryland. The couple had eight children, two of whom, Creston (1865‚Äì1910) and Wilfred (1867‚Äì1945), became actors. Wilfred would later marry actress Victory Bateman. Because the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865 was committed by her brother, John Wilkes Booth, she and her husband emigrated to England, where they stayed until the end of their lives. Asia became a poet and writer, and through her work some insight was gained into the lives of the Booths, particularly John Wilkes. The Unlocked Book: John Wilkes Booth, a Sister's Memoir was written in 1874, but she kept its existence secret, fearing it would upset her husband. He had been imprisoned and forced to testify at the Lincoln assassination co-conspirators' trials, because of his family connection. The memoir was published in 1938 by G. P. Putnam's Sons, when her heirs felt the public would be receptive. It was re-edited and republished in 1996 as John Wilkes Booth: A Sister's Memoir. Her other family memoirs, which she was able to publish during her lifetime, focused on the acting careers of her father and her brother Edwin Booth. The first, titled Booth memorials: Passages, incidents, and anecdotes in the life of Junius Brutus Booth (the Elder) by His Daughter, was published in December 1865, within a year of Lincoln's assassination. Asia Booth Clarke is buried in the family plot at Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore.

Ordinarily, any form of acceptance must be communicated expressly to an offeror; however, it was found that where a letter of acceptance is posted, an offer is accepted \\"in course of post\\". Facts The case involved two parties in the sale of wool. On 2 September, the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs offering to sell them certain fleeces of wool and requiring an answer in the course of post. The defendants misdirected the letter so that the plaintiffs did not receive it until 5 September.Beale (2002) p.221 The plaintiffs posted their acceptance on the same day but it was not received until 9 September. Meanwhile, on 8 September, the defendants, not having received an answer by 7 September as they had expected, sold the wool to someone else. The defendants argued that there could not be a binding contract until the answer was actually received, and until then they were free to sell the wool to another buyer. Judgment Law J said that if that was true it would be impossible to complete any contract through the post; if the defendants were not bound by their offer until the answer was received, then the plaintiffs would not be bound until they had received word that the defendants had received their acceptance, and this could go on indefinitely. Instead it must be considered that the offerors were making the offer to the plaintiffs during every moment that the letter was in the post. Then when the Offeree has placed his acceptance in the post there is a meeting of minds, which concludes the offer and gives effect to the acceptance.Beale (2002) p.222 The acceptance did not arrive in course of post strictly speaking (all parties understood in course of post to refer to 7 September). But because the delay was the fault of the defendant it was taken that the acceptance did arrive in course of post. Significance This case is the first step towards establishing the postal acceptance rule (mailbox rule). It was not until 1892 in Henthorn v Fraser [1892] 2 Ch 27 that the court determined the precise timing of the acceptance, that is the moment the letter of acceptance is posted.

He was active in the nascent civil rights era in Canada, beginning with his arrival in 1947. Armstrong was a committed union activist who worked to improve conditions for workers in industry. He was also active in promoting equal rights for African-Canadians and was involved with the National Unity Association (NUA) in sit-ins in Dresden, Ontario restaurants that refused to serve blacks. Armstrong travelled to Dresden following the activities of Hugh Burnett and the NUA‚Äîthe NUA had been urging the local town council (unsuccessfully) to create laws that would put an end to discrimination against blacks in the town. In response to delegations to the Ontario Legislature at Queen's Park in the provincial capital of Toronto, in the early 1950s Ontario Premier Leslie Frost brought two laws into place, the Fair Employment Practices Act and the Fair Accommodation Practices Act. The first outlawed discrimination in the workplace, the second outlawed it in businesses that served the public. Enacted in April 1954, the Fair Accommodation Practices Act stated: \\"No one can deny to any person or class of persons the accommodation, services or facilities usually available to members of the public.\\" The Act triggered the repeal of the largely ineffective Racial Discrimination Act of 1944, which outlawed \\"the publication or display, on lands, premises, by newspaper or radio, of any notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation indicating racial discrimination.\\" After local Dresden businesses refused to comply with the Fair Accommodation Practices Act the same year it was enacted, Armstrong and other activists from the Toronto-based Joint Labour Committee for Human Rights conducted sit-ins in Dresden restaurants, testing the owners' non-compliance with the law, and then using that information to urge Premier Frost to eventually press charges against the restaurant owners. The owners were taken to court and the law held; the legal case was Canada's first successful test of laws making discrimination illegal. Armstrong figured in the sit-ins, on one occasion calmly demanding service of a bigoted restaurant owner, who was angrily wielding a meat cleaver in his restaurant kitchen. In 1994, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. Armstrong's story is told in his autobiography: Bromley: Tireless Fighter for Just Causes.

The conflict emerged in May 2006 with the police responding to a strike involving the local teachers' trade union by opening fire on non- violent protests. It then grew into a broad-based movement pitting the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO) against the state's governor, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz. Protesters demanded the removal or resignation of Ortiz, whom they accused of political corruption and acts of repression. Multiple reports, including from international human rights monitors, accused the Mexican government of using death squads, summary executions, and even violating Geneva Conventions standards that prohibit attacking and shooting at unarmed medics attending to the wounded. One human rights observer claimed over twenty-seven were killed by the police violence. The dead included Brad Will, Emilio Alonso Fabi√°n, Jos√© Alberto L√≥pez Bernal, Fidel S√°nchez Garc√≠a, and Esteban Zurita L√≥pez. APPO barricade and graffiti in central Oaxaca, June 2006.  Organisation  After the police fired on non-violent protesters, the teacher's union fought back and were able to force the police out of the city and establish a citywide anarchist community for several months. The teacher's union and other worker's and community groups form the APPO which created large democratic assemblies for citizens. According to one activist who helped to found the APPO: > So the APPO was formed to address the abuses and create an alternative. It > was to be a space for discussion, reflection, analysis, and action. We > recognized that it shouldn‚Äôt be just one organization, but rather a blanket > coordinating body for many different groups. That is, not one ideology would > prevail; we would focus on finding the common ground among diverse social > actors. Students, teachers, anarchists, Marxists, churchgoers ‚Äî everyone was > invited. > The APPO was born without a formal structure, but soon developed impressive > organizational capacity. Decisions in the APPO are made by consensus within > the general assembly, which was privileged as a decision-making body. In the > first few weeks of our existence we created the APPO State Council. The > council was originally composed of 260 people ‚Äî approximately ten > representatives from each of Oaxaca‚Äôs seven regions and representatives from > Oaxaca‚Äôs urban neighborhoods and municipalities. > The Provisional Coordination was created to facilitate the operation of the > APPO through different commissions. A variety of commissions were > established: judicial, finance, communications, human rights, gender equity, > defense of natural resources, and many more. Proposals are generated in > smaller assemblies of each sector of the APPO and then brought to the > general assembly where they are debated further or ratified. There was deep tension in the group between the more radical and libertarian elements who rejected representative democracy and wanted to create a permanent self-organised society against the more conservative and moderate elements who wanted elections. Ultimately, the radicals were more successful and the elections were boycotted by most of the population. The APPO was also able to organise festivals, defensive measures, radio stations and a neighbourhood watch. The festivals, the 'Guelaguetza' thousands of people attended for free to see indigenous culture, dresses and dancing whilst graffiti artists packed the streets and covered the walls of the towns in anti-government and anti-capitalist messages. The APPO also used 'topiles' as a method of keeping the peace. These were neighbourhood watches that also doubled as a militia which fought off government soldiers often with little more than rocks and fireworks. If a criminal was found to be disturbing someone, a bell would be used to alert the nearest topile, who would either give them a minor fine or perhaps hold them for the night. The topiles were successful in organising first aid centres and garbage collection. May and June 2006 In May 2006, a teachers' strike began in the Z√≥calo in the Mexican city of Oaxaca. 2006 was the 25th consecutive year that Oaxaca's teachers had struck. Previously, the protests had generally lasted for one to two weeks and had resulted in small raises for teachers. The 2006 strike began in protest of the low funding for teachers and rural schools in the state, but was prompted to additionally call for the resignation of the state governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz after 3000 police were sent to break up the occupation in the early morning of June 14, 2006. A street battle lasted for several hours that day, resulting in more than one hundred hospitalizations but no fatalities. Ortiz declared that he would not resign. Protests in Oaxaca City centre on June 22, 2006. In response to the events of June 14, representatives of Oaxaca's state regions and municipalities, unions, non-governmental organizations, social organizations, cooperatives, and parents convened to form the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO, from its Spanish name, Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca). On June 17 APPO reestablished encampments in the zocalo and declared itself to be the governing body of Oaxaca, plunging the city into a state of civil rebellion. Barricades were constructed across some streets in an effort to prevent further police raids. APPO began to seek country-wide solidarity with their movement and urged other states within Mexico to similarly organize popular assemblies at every level of social organization: neighborhoods, street blocks, unions, and towns. Various municipality offices across the state closed in unity. A popular mantra was, ‚ÄúNo leader is going to solve our problems‚Äù. Popular Guelaguetza organized by protesters. Though APPO did not boycott the Mexican national elections on July 2, Ulises Ruiz's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) suffered electoral defeat in Oaxaca, a state they had ruled for seventy years. APPO did agree to boycott the annual Guelaguetza festival in the final weeks of July. Protesters blocked access to the auditorium in which the festival is held using burned buses and miscellaneous trash, thus preventing the finalization of renovations to the facility. This action drew criticism due to the damage that some individuals did to the auditorium by starting fires and spray painting graffiti. Some of the graffiti said: \\"Tourists, go home! In Oaxaca we are not capitalists\\". As a result of the boycott, the government cancelled the celebration of the festival ‚Äì in its stead the APPO held an alternative version of the cultural festival over the course of several days. The action marked the lowest point of government for Ulises Ruiz, who subsequently left the State. He resided in Mexico City for a few months. After a few weeks of absence, the APPO assumed control of the city and started implementing their own law, while confrontations with State Police escalated. August 2006 August 1 saw the beginning of APPO's break in of television and radio stations throughout the city. While all of these stations are no longer occupied by APPO members, the use of radio has been an important facet of the movement. APPO utilized the radio resources in order to communicate about possible threats from police and armed gangs, demand the removal of Ulises Ruiz and the release of political prisoners. During APPO's illegal occupation of the radio stations, pro-PRI and PRI-funded groups engaged in frequent late-night armed attacks on APPO- controlled radio stations and damaged their broadcasting equipment. Those attacks on the APPO-controlled radio stations represented an escalation of violence in a conflict that (despite constant rumors of threats) had remained relatively peaceful since the June 14 police raid. In what was called a \\"cleanup operation\\", armed groups of men attacked the APPO's barricades during the nights. The individuals involved were identified as members of pro-PRI organizations and as plain-clothes local police. These attacks, combined with other shootings and assassinations, resulted in the first deaths associated with the conflict, in which six APPO supporters were killed. September 2006 On September 14, striking teachers and APPO members took over the municipal building in Huautla de Jim√©nez, located in the Sierra Mazateca in northern Oaxaca. They retained control of the building until mid-January 2007 (months after the government regained control of Oaxaca City), when Oaxacan state police briefly occupied the city, patrolling the streets with large guns and guarding the municipio all hours of the day and night. The leader of Mazatecan APPO, Agust√≠n Sosa, was elected mayor (presidente) of Huautla de Jim√©nez in November 2007, to a term beginning in January, 2008. Sosa is a longtime activist who spent many months in jail in 2004, accused of murder in the death of a protester (at the hands of the police) at a protest organized by Sosa. He bears no relation to Flavio Sosa, the still imprisoned leader of APPO. October 2006 Mexican Armed Forces assemble near the airport in Oaxaca. On October 27, 2006, Bradley Roland Will, a U.S. Indymedia journalist from New York who had entered the country under a tourist visa, was killed along with Professor Emilio Alonso Fabi√°n and Esteban L√≥pez Zurita, in what the Associated Press has claimed was a \\"shootout\\" between protesters and a group of armed men. Photographs by Brad Will, however, demonstrate that the protesters were throwing rocks at the gunman. Photographs of Will, after he was shot, show a man lying on the ground, surrounded by friends, and not the \\"armed gangs\\" that the Associated Press has reported. An autopsy by the Mexican government has concluded that \\"two shots\\" were fired at Will, one from in front and one from behind (which, the government alleges, was fired by a protester). The body was never examined for blood clotting in the second wound, which would have demonstrated that it was \\"implemented\\" in the morgue. Brad Will's body was cremated. The family of Brad Will visited Mexico to demand justice from the court system, and upon hearing the accusation that their son was shot at close range by a protester, they called it \\"ridiculous, false, without substance, biased, and unconvincing.\\" They also accused the District Attorney of falsifying evidence and acting in bad faith. However, protesters claim the shooting was by a group of armed men against unarmed protesters. Oswaldo Ram√≠rez, a photographer for Mexico City daily Milenio, was also shot in the foot. Lizbeth Cana, attorney general of Oaxaca, claims the shooting of the protesters was provoked by the protesters themselves and that the armed men who engaged them were upset residents from the area. The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Tony Garza, however, claims the men may have been local police. El Universal has identified some of the men as local officials. Protesters also allege that the men were police and not local residents. Indymedia claims from a first-hand witness that the man who shot Will was an \\"urban paramilitary\\" member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. A local news organisation, Centro de Medios Libres, claims that from Will's recovered videotapes, they have found that Pedro Carmona, a paramilitary who was the mayor of Felipe Carrillo Puerto in Santa Luc√≠a del Camino, was the person who shot Bradley Roland Will. Another shooting took place later in the day outside the state prosecutor's office, leading to three injuries. An Associated Press report by Rebeca Romero (December 11, 2006, 12:33 am (ET)) claims, \\"Most of the nine victims of the Oaxaca violence have been protesters who were shot by armed gangs...\\" One protester, in response to the massive denunciations of the state-controlled media, has said, \\"I saw a young boy shot in the leg, friends around me arrested left and right, bullets flying everywhere. The government needed someone to blame, and it came down heaviest on the people at the barricades, especially strategic barricades like Cinco Senores. They called us vandals and thieves and delinquents.\\" The death of Bradley Roland Will prompted President Vicente Fox to send federal police to Oaxaca after months of attempting to stay neutral in what he considered a local issue. =October 29‚Äì30= At least two protesters, Social Security Institute workers Roberto L√≥pez Hern√°ndez and nurse and APPO safety commission member Jorge Alberto Beltr√°n, were killed when about 3,500 federal police and 3000 military police removed protesters in downtown Oaxaca's Z√≥calo, with a backup of 5,000 army troops waiting just outside the city. The police forces were met with resistance from protesters and Radio APPO reported police raids (which were denied by the federal government) on activists' homes, helicopters dropped chemical grenades (apparently tear gas) on protesters who had been pushed from the Z√≥calo. There were multiple unconfirmed reports of a young teenager, but rather a twelve-year-old child, shot in the streets near Puente Tecnol√≥gico; the boy's body was reportedly taken by police. There have been some deaths according to local media, and while the APPO claims 'dozens' of deaths, the exact number is yet unknown. Protests continued, with sporadic clashes occurring around the Z√≥calo, which is held by Federal forces. Numerous people have been detained; footage shows at least four being removed in a PFP Mi-17 helicopter. The Mexican Episcopate Conference, an organization of the Catholic Church, supported the intervention of the Federal Police in the conflict. On October 30, 2006, the Revolutionary Indigenous Clandestine Committee (CCRI) issued a notice condemning the government tactics and the killings, including that of a minor; through the communiqu√©, the EZLN indicated a four-point response, which included the closing of some highways in the southeast state of Chiapas, and their vocal support to the people of Oaxaca. November 2006 An open letter written \\"to honor the memory\\" of slain journalist Brad Will and support \\"the Oaxacan people's efforts to establish a popular government that recognizes local traditions and values\\", was signed in early November by numerous academics and activists, including Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, Michael Moore, Arundhati Roy, Starhawk and Howard Zinn. =November 2, 2006= Federal Preventative Police advanced on the Benito Ju√°rez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, occupied by students and displaced protesters from the Zocalo. Since the University is autonomous, the police are forbidden from entering the grounds, unless invited by the Rector. Thousands of protesters arrived in the following hours, surrounding the police and eventually forcing them to withdraw from the area surrounding the university. The APPO has also received permission by the university rector, through threats of violence, to broadcast their messages through the university radio, which they have used to criticise political parties, the PRI specifically. Opinions against the APPO are quickly taken off the air After criticism by the private sector, political organizations and the press (specifically Grupo Formula's news anchor Denise Maerker) for his remarks towards the APPO the rector declared that he had requested respect for the rights of students and faculty and that a tentative operation by the Federal Police would not be a solution to the issue =November 6, 2006= Three explosions in Mexico City destroyed a Scotiabank branch lobby, blew out windows at Mexico's Tribunal Federal Electoral (Federal Electoral Tribunal), and damaged the auditorium at PRI headquarters. Other homemade bombs were placed in a second Scotiabank branch and in front of the chain restaurant Sanborns, but these were disabled before exploding. A phone call was placed to authorities shortly before midnight which warned of the bombings. None of the exploded bombs resulted in injuries or death. A coalition of five leftist guerrilla groups from Oaxaca claimed responsibility for the blasts. There are no known ties between these guerrilla groups and Oaxacan protesters, and APPO members denied any involvement in or knowledge of the bombings. =November 10‚Äì13, 2006= Despite the presence of federal police in the city, the APPO has continued to organize, holding a Constituent Congress in order to discuss plans to rewrite Oaxaca's political constitution. Likewise, in an attempt to broaden its focus throughout the state and develop future projects, the movement formed the State Council of the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (CEAPPO). This new council will be formed of 260 representatives from the various regions of Oaxaca, including 40 members of the teachers' union. This represents a major development for the APPO's continuing attempts to develop alternative political proposals while still pushing for the removal of Ulises Ruiz. =November 25‚Äì26, 2006= On Saturday, November 25, 2006, a large clash between the federal police and demonstrators occurred in the evening following the seventh megamarch held by the APPO. The march began peacefully, but the situation turned violent when the police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets as protesters attempted to encircle the city's z√≥calo. It is unclear who instigated the violence, but the clash quickly spread through the city as protesters fought back with rocks and homemade PVC rockets. Police took the APPO encampment in the Santo Domingo plaza and arrested more than 160 people. Many APPO supporters were hospitalized, and the deaths of three protesters were reported but remain unconfirmed. On Saturday, and continuing on Sunday, November 26, fires were set by the protesters to numerous vehicles, and fires also destroyed or damaged four buildings housing government offices (including a tax and court office), one university building, and an office building of a local trade association. Three hotels were also attacked, and some local businesses were looted. On Monday, November 27, 2006, the Chief of the Federal Police, Ardelio Vargas, stated that they would no longer have any more tolerance for the APPO. \\"There will be no more tolerance (...) those who go against the law will have their punishment. The warrants and orders of arrest are not ordered by the police, but by local and federal judges\\", he said. Efforts have been made to follow through on these threats as movement leaders have been arrested and organizational offices have been raided. After indications that the APPO would assemble at the State University Campus following the weekends confrontations, Vargas said that \\"there will be no violation of the autonomy of the University\\" In the following days the APPO removed the last of their barricades from the city and turned over control of the university radio station to the rector, citing lack of security. APPO leaders have gone into hiding, claiming a repressive crackdown by state authorities against those involved in the movement. The police have been accused of arresting teachers out of classrooms, beating detainees and false arrests. December 2006 On Monday, December 4, hours after he said at a news conference in Mexico City that he had gone to the capital to negotiate a peaceful solution, Flavio Sosa was arrested by police on charges related to the barricades, vandalism and irregular detentions carried out by some protesters. Sosa's brother, Horacio, and two other men were also arrested on unspecified charges. Flavio Sosa's heavy-set, bearded presence became an emblem of APPO. After his arrest, the PRD, through their speaker, Gerardo Fernandez Noro√±a, revealed that Sosa was a member of the party's National Council and said that this obliged them to assume Sosa's legal defense. The following week, the federal police seized armament from Oaxaca's State Police and said that local forces were under investigation based on accusations of murder that the APPO made against them. The APPO reported that the federal government offered to not detain any other members of their movement. Ulises Ruiz At the heart of the continuing conflict are attitudes towards the state's governor, Ulises Ruiz, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party which governed Mexico for most of the 20th century, but which now is a minority in a nation where political power resides in 3 main parties. However, the main power struggle is between the rightist National Action Party and the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, leaving the Institutional Revolutionary Party free to form coalitions with one of the two parties. Ruiz is a polemical figure whom opponents accuse of stealing his 2004 election, suppressing the freedom of the press, destruction of public spaces and historical monuments in the city, and repression of political opponents. Protestors argue that the constitution gives the central government the power under certain circumstances to remove a sitting governor; the Senate of the Republic, voted on the issue and decided that those \\"special circumstances\\" are not to be found in Oaxaca. As the conflict in Oaxaca has grown more intractable, outside pressure on Ruiz to resign has grown, but he has not shown signs of budging. The senate has blamed both the governor and the APPO for the violence that originated in the state, while the business group Coparmex in the state of Puebla and the then Secretary of the Interior Carlos Abascal have called for his resignation or blamed him for the conflict. The APPO has made his resignation or removal their one non-negotiable demand before they will agree to end the conflict.

Copley (photo by Paolo Monti, 1960) William N. Copley (January 24, 1919 ‚Äì May 7, 1996) also known as CPLY, was an American painter, writer, gallerist, collector, patron, publisher and art entrepreneur. His works as an artist have been classified as late Surrealist and precursory to Pop Art.  Early life and introduction to art  Copley was born in New York City in 1919 and was adopted in 1921 by Ira C. Copley, the owner of sixteen newspaper companies in Chicago and San Diego. Ira C. Copley remarried after the death of his wife, Edith, several years after the adoption took place. The three lived in Aurora, Illinois, until Copley was ten years old whereby the family moved to Coronado Island, California. Copley was sent to Phillips Andover and then Yale University by his adopted parents. He was drafted in the Second World War in the middle of his education at Yale, a decision negotiated by the school and the army. Copley experimented with politics upon returning home from the war, working as a reporter for his father's newspaper. By 1946, Copley met and married Marjorie Doris Wead, the daughter of a test pilot for the Navy. Doris's sister was married to John Ployardt, a Canadian-born animator and narrator at Walt Disney Studios. Copley and Ployardt soon became friends and Ployardt began introducing Copley to painting and Surrealism. The two traveled to Mexico and New York, discovering art, meeting the artists behind the works, and grasping Surrealist ideas. It was during this time that Copley and Ployardt decided to open a gallery in Los Angeles to exhibit Surrealist works.  Galleries and foundation  Copley and Ployardt tracked down Man Ray while living in Los Angeles. Ray then introduced them to Marcel Duchamp in New York City. There, Duchamp opened many doors for them, introducing the two to New York dealers in Surrealism. In 1948, Copley and Ployardt opened The Copley Galleries in Beverley Hills, displaying works by artists including Ren√© Magritte, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, Roberto Matta, Joseph Cornell, and Man Ray.The Jonathan Griffin, \\"The Surrealist Bungalow: William N. Copley and the Copley Galleries (1948‚Äì49),\\" east of borneo (January 13, 2014) https://eastofborneo.org/articles/the-surrealist-bungalow-william-n- copley-and-the-copley-galleries-1948-49/ However, Los Angeles had not yet caught on to the Surrealist scene as other locations such as New York City had done, and the Copley Galleries faced hardships in gaining popularity and sales. Copley painted part-time during the gallery's running from the encouragement of friends Duchamp and Ernst and worked on painting full-time when the gallery closed after its first year. Copley moved to Paris in 1949‚Äì50, leaving behind his wife and two children to continue to paint. During his time in Paris, he remained in Surrealist circles and continued to paint with a uniquely American style. Man Ray introduced him to Noma Rathner, whom he married in 1954. Man Ray took numerous portraits of the Copleys and served as best man at their wedding in Paris.Neil Baldwin, Man Ray. American Artist, (Da Capo Press, 1988), 398 Their home in Longpont in the outskirts of Paris became a central gathering place in the postwar era for a community of Surrealists to reunite after their dispersal during the war.Cay Sophie Rabinowitz, ed. William N. Copley: An American Close to Paris: Longpont-sur- Orge (New York: Osmos, 2018). The Copleys developed the William and Noma Copley Foundation, later known as the Cassandra Collection, in 1953 with the funds from his father's inheritance. The board, in which Marcel Duchamp was also an adviser, gave small grants to artists and musicians. Upon Duchamp's death in 1968, the William and Noma Copley Foundation (later the Cassandra Foundation) gave Marcel Duchamp's last work, \\"Etant Donn√©s\\" to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where it is still on view. = Collecting = From the time of the Copley Galleries until his death, Copley amassed a large collection of artworks with an emphasis on Surrealist works. The basis of his collection started when he began purchasing works that did not sell at the Copley Galleries. From there, he amassed monumental works including Man Ray's \\"A l'Heure de l'Observatoire ‚Äì Les Amoureux.\\" Copley's collection was sold at auction in 1979 for $6.7 million, at the time the highest total for the auction of a single owner's collection in the United States.  Artwork and exhibitions  Copley's first exhibition took place in Los Angeles in 1951 at Royer's Book Shop. From there Copley participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions worldwide. In 1961, Copley was given an exhibition in Amsterdam by the Stedelijk Museum. The museum became the first public institution to add a Copley to their collection. Copley's paintings throughout the 1950s and 60s dealt with ironic and humorous images of stereotypical American symbols like the Western saloon, cowboys, and pin-up girls combined with flags. His works during this period were often considered a combination of American and Mexican folk art and melded in well with the new young POP movement occurring in America when he returned to New York in the 1960s. Artists like Andy Warhol, Christo, Roy Lichtenstein and many others were frequent visitors at Copley's studio on Lower Broadway. Copley believed that pop art had always interested him, claiming American pop art had much to do with \\"self-disgust\\" and \\"satire.\\" = The Letter Edged in Black Press (SMS) = In 1967, after a divorce with his second wife, Noma, Copley and new friend Dmitri Petrov decided to publish portfolios of 20th-century artist collaborations with the abbreviation SMS (for \\"Shit Must Stop\\"). Copley's Upper West Side loft became a meeting place for performers, artists, curators, and composers to work together on the open-ended collective. The SMS portfolio contained six volumes, each of which were shipped out from the artists to subscribers. The works included came from artists both well-renowned and obscure, including Marcel Duchamp, Roy Lichtenstein, Man Ray, Christo, Richard Hamilton, Claes Oldenburg, John Cage, Terry Riley, La Monte Young, Dick Higgins, Ronnie Landfield, Bruce Nauman, Meret Oppenheim, Neil Jenney, Yoko Ono and others.Brooklyn Museum, open collection, objects = CPLY X-Rated = Copley's works in the 1970s focused on his own understating of differences and challenges between men and women in romantic and sexual relationships. His works were now erotic, even pornographic. In 1974 he exhibited these new works at what was then the New York Cultural Center in Columbus Circle, New York in a show titled \\"CPLY X-Rated.\\" These pieces were a sudden change from his previous romantic whimsical periods. The American public had difficulty with the material, for which Copley expressed, \\"Americans... don't know the difference between eroticism and pornography. Because eroticism has always existed in art. And pornography has never necessarily been in art.\\" Copley's experienced greater feedback in Europe, where the work was then well received. In conjunction with the New York Cultural Center Show there was a special \\"CPLY X-Rated Poster and Catalog.  Later years  Copley moved to Roxbury, Connecticut in 1980, where he built a studio and spent time among friends. In 1992 he moved full-time to Key West, Florida, due to health issues and lived with his sixth and final wife, Cynthia Gooch. He died on May 7, 1996, at age 77 from complications from a stroke he had suffered three weeks earlier. Mr. Copley's first five marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his son, who is also a painter, he was survived by his wife, Cynthia Gooch; two daughters, Claire of Manhattan and Theodora of Ohio, and four grandchildren. His daughter, Claire S. Copley,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/24/style/alan- eisenberg-marries-claire-copley.html founded the short-lived, but influential Claire Copley Gallery, which exhibited important works by Michael Asher and Bas Jan Ader.Griffin, Jonathan. \\"The Surrealist Bungalow: William N.

Founded in 2002, and receiving its first charter approval from Chicago Public Schools in 2005, it operates the first all-male public charter high school in the United States. The network opened a second campus in 2009 and a third in August 2010. From 2010‚Äì2019, 100% of the seniors in the school's graduating classes were admitted to four-year colleges or universities. About Urban Prep =History= In 2002, a group of African- American civic, business, and education leaders, organized by former Hales Franciscan High School President Tim King, determined to establish a new high school in Chicago focused on providing a strong, college-preparatory high school option for boys in under-served African-American communities. African- American males had been, and continue to be, the lowest-performing demographic in Chicago Public Schools. A University of Chicago study published in 2006 reported that only one in 40 African-American boys in Chicago Public Schools will eventually graduate from a 4-year university. The Chicago Board of Education approved Urban Prep Academies' charter application in 2005, and Urban Prep opened its first school, Urban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men ‚Äî Englewood Campus, the subsequent September. It is the first charter high school for boys in the country and currently enrolls 460 students in grades 9-12. Urban Prep's second school opened in the East Garfield Park community in 2009, and moved to the near west side of the city in 2011. Urban Prep's third campus, serving the historic Bronzeville community, opened in 2010. Based on its success thus far, Urban Prep plans to open more schools in the Chicago area and in other low-performing urban centers. Approximately 85% of Urban Prep students are low-income and nearly all are African-American. =Admissions= Admission to Urban Prep is non-selective and determined through a lottery system. Enrollment is open to all matriculating 9th grade boys living in Chicago. Information on the lottery admission process is available on Urban Prep's admissions webpage. =Support and funding= Urban Prep Academies is a 501(c)3 tax-deductible charity organization, and relies substantially on private donors to support its operations. The organization's largest source of funding is the Illinois State Board of Education, which funds all charter schools in the state on a per-pupil basis. In 2008, Urban Prep received an anonymous donation of $1,000,000. In 2009, the Oprah Winfrey Foundation donated $250,000. =Media= Urban Prep has been the subject of many national and international news features. Virtually all local television news outlets in Chicago have profiled the schools, as have CNN and the 700 Club on their national broadcasts. Print media on the school has included pieces in the Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Chicago Tribune, Ebony magazine and The Guardian. During the 2009 Presidential Inauguration, Urban Prep students who had traveled to Washington D.C. were interviewed on CNN with newscaster Don Lemon. During the interview, Lemon referred to the students as the \\"Little Obamas.\\" CNN has used the phrase to refer to Urban Prep students in subsequent newscasts, and Oprah Winfrey repeated the phrase when discussing the school in a segment of The Oprah Winfrey Show regarding education in the US. The schools again became the focus of national media attention in March 2010, upon the announcement that 100% of the first graduating class had been accepted to a four-year college or university. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley visited the Englewood Campus to speak with students, and various national media outlets featured the school. The Chicago Tribune covered the story on its front page, MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News all ran short segments on the senior class, and ABC World News Tonight with Diane Sawyer profiled the school as its \\"Person of the Week.\\" Daley again visited the Englewood Campus at the announcement that the Class of 2011 had followed their schoolmates in having all graduating class members accepted to a four-year college or university. Urban Prep became the focus on national attention again in 2012 when they announced a \\"three-peat\\", with all graduating members of the Class of 2012 having been accepted to college. The announcement ceremony was attended by Illinois Governor Patrick Quinn. The announcement coincided with a Chicago Tribune editorial endorsing the school's success. School programs *Arcs: Urban Prep structures its educational approach through four curricular and extracurricular \\"arcs\\": **The Academic Arc: a rigorous college prep curriculum with added focus on reading, writing, and public speaking skills. **The Service Arc: a focus on deepening the students' sense of responsibility and identification of community needs by completing volunteer programs throughout the area. **The Activity Arc: a focus on increasing students' confidence, interpersonal skills, and leadership qualities by participating in at least two school-sponsored activities per year (sports, clubs, etc.). **The Professional Arc: a focus on providing students with valuable experience in a professional setting by requiring them to spend one day a week within such a setting. This serves to reinforce character and leadership development in students, as well as providing for them a means of work experience. *School Culture: A positive school culture is maintained by continued emphasis on the \\"Four R's\\": **Respect: Students and staff members address each other by surnames (Mr. Hatch, Ms. Johnson) only. **Responsibility: Students are held accountable to a strict code of conduct. **Ritual: Daily, weekly and yearly rituals such as Community and Tropaia reinforce feelings of community and self-worth. **Relationship: Each Urban Prep staff member is issued a cell phone whose number is distributed to all students, allowing for continuous contact. *Pride System: Each grade level at Urban Prep is divided into six groups of twenty students, known as \\"Prides\\". The \\"Pride\\" name is derived from the school's mascot, the Lion. Prides function as smaller units within the school to provide each student with an individualized mentor (the Pride Leader, typically an Urban Prep Fellow), as well as a peer-support network. Prides compete with one another for points awarded for good attendance, high average GPA, and through intramural athletic competitions. Alternatively, Prides may lose points for dress infractions, attendance violations, or other disciplinary infractions. The Pride with the highest overall point total is awarded the Pride Cup at the annual year-end ceremony, known as Tropaia. *Uniforms and Discipline: Urban Prep students are required to wear uniforms and adhere to a clearly communicated discipline program based on community and mutual respect. The Urban Prep school uniform consists of khaki pants, a white buttoned down and collared dress shirt, solid-red school necktie, and black two-button blazer with an embroidered school crest. *Summer Programs: During the summer, students participate in academic, professional, and service programs throughout Chicago and around the world. Recently, students have attended summer programs at the UK's Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well as elite stateside institutions including Northwestern University and Georgetown University. All incoming freshmen must attend the summer program that begins in August and ends just before the beginning of the school year. *Athletics: Urban Prep campuses operate independent athletic programs that participate separately, and occasionally compete against one another, in the Chicago Public League. The Lions currently compete in the following sports: **Baseball **Basketball **Bowling **Cross country **Football **Golf **Track and field **Wrestling Urban Prep Fellows Program The Urban Prep Fellows Program, launched at Urban Prep in 2009, recruits recent college graduates from around the nation to work as full-time volunteer mentors, leaders, and educators for students at Urban Prep for a period of one year. Urban Prep Fellows are matched with a group of about twenty students - called a \\"Pride,\\" of which there are six in each grade level - to provide mentoring, academic support, social and emotional guidance, and instruction in one course. In addition to their service to the students, Fellows participate in ongoing community activities and a seminar series to connect their experiences with leaders and ideas shaping change in urban communities. During the Fellowship year, Fellows are provided with housing, transportation, health benefits, and a monthly living stipend. Urban Prep Alumni Program Due to the school's emphasis on success in college, the Urban Prep Alumni Program was launched in 2009, before the first senior class had graduated. Based out of the school's office at 420 North Wabash, the Alumni Program maintains contact with and helps provide for the unique needs of each of Urban Prep's graduates. In addition to publishing a regular alumni newsletter, the Alumni Program helps graduates navigate the intricacies of applying for financial aid and finding tutoring help, as needed. Urban Prep graduates have matriculated into a wide array of public and private colleges and universities, including Georgetown, Cornell, Northwestern, Grinnell, Morehouse and the University of Virginia. Urban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men - Englewood Campus =History= Urban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men - Englewood Campus opened in the fall of 2006 as the United States' first all-male public charter high school. The school's charter was granted in 2005 by the Chicago Board of Education with support from Mayor Richard M. Daley and Chicago Public Schools CEO Arne Duncan's Renaissance 2010 initiative, which aimed to open 100 new schools in Chicago before the year 2010. During its first year of operations, the school was located in the former facility of Chicago Public Schools Robert Lindblom High School. In Fall of 2007, The school relocated to its present home, another CPS facility, at 6201 S. Stewart. =School Traditions= *Convocation: At the start of each academic year, incoming freshman students from all Urban Prep Academies campuses gather together for an evening event to mark the transition into high school. Urban Prep's Convocation ceremony is rife with rituals, including a procession of the organization's board members and faculty in full academic regalia, speeches by noteworthy public figures, a public show of support by the schools' \\"Brothers' Keepers,\\" presentation of crested uniform blazers for the freshmen, and the students' first public recitation of the school creed. *Red and Gold Bowl: The first football match between Urban Prep's Englewood and East Garfield Park campuses occurred in 2009, and was referred to as the \\"Red and Gold Bowl.\\" Due to the fact that 2009 was the inaugural year of the East Garfield Park campus, and the campus only had a freshman (and not a junior varsity or varsity) football team, only the schools' freshman teams played one another. *Tropaia: At the end of each academic year, a school-wide banquet is held to honor students' achievements in the previous year. Individual awards are given for the student at each grade level with the best attendance record, most improvement in GPA, and highest overall GPA. The Pride Cup is awarded to the Pride which has accumulated the most points in the previous year. The name of the ceremony is derived from the Greek word meaning \\"trophy.\\" *Speaker Series: Past guest speakers at the Englewood Campus include director Spike Lee, US Congressman Bobby Rush, US Senator Dick Durbin, US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, McDonald's President and COO Don Thompson, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, and Major League Baseball star Gary Sheffield. Urban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men - West Campus =History= Urban Prep Academy for Young Men - East Garfield Park was granted approval to operate as a Contract school by the Chicago Board of Education in 2008. The school opened welcomed its first freshman class in September 2009. After operating in a Chicago Public Schools facility shared with Willa Cather Elementary School for two years, East Garfield Park was rechristened as Urban Prep Academies - West Campus and moved to its present location at 1326 W 14th Pl in the fall of 2011. After Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed a law in the summer of 2009 raising the cap on charter schools, Urban Prep Academies applied to the Chicago Board of Education to convert the school's legal status from Contract School to Charter School. The application was approved in the fall of 2009 for the school to occupy Charter status beginning in the 2010-2011 school year. Urban Prep Academy for Young Men - Bronzeville Campus =History= The South Shore Campus opened in a temporary facility in the North Kenwood/Oakland community area in August 2010, and moved to the location within Chicago Public School's Williams School Complex at 2710 South Dearborn Avenue the following year. The school's leadership consists of a transfer from the Englewood campus; principal Joffrey Bywater. As of 2018, The school is housed in the former Chicago High School of The Arts (ChiArts) building at 521 E. 35th Street. Images Image:UP Grad.jpgA graduate of Urban Prep, 2011.

A taxpayer may, for a fee, seek advice from the IRS on the proper tax treatment of a transaction. This is called a private letter ruling. A letter ruling binds only the IRS and the requesting taxpayer, so it may not be cited or relied on for precedent. The IRS does have the option of redacting the text of a private ruling and issuing it as a revenue ruling, which may become binding on all taxpayers and the IRS. \\"Even if it is clear that the taxpayer did not rely on a revenue ruling, courts will often hold the Service to the position expressed in the revenue ruling.\\"Mitchell Rogovin & Donald L. Korb, \\"The Four R‚Äôs Revisited: Regulations, Rulings, Reliance, and Retroactivity in the 21st Century: A View From Within\\", 46 Duquesne Law Review 323, 336 (2008). Revenue rulings are published in both the Internal Revenue Bulletin and the Federal Register. The numbering system for revenue rulings corresponds to the year in which they are issued. For example, Revenue Ruling 79-24 was the twenty-fourth revenue ruling issued in 1979. Public administrative rulings are part of second-tier authorities and are subordinate to the Internal Revenue Code and other statutes, Treasury regulations, treaties, and court decisions. They hold higher weight than third-tier authorities, such as legislative history and private letter rulings. Revenue rulings can be used to avoid certain IRS penalties. Comparison with revenue procedures Revenue rulings are different from Revenue Procedures. A revenue procedure is an official statement of a procedure that affects the rights or duties of taxpayers under the law, while a revenue ruling is the conclusion of the IRS on how the law is applied to a specific set of facts. Generally, a revenue ruling states the IRS position, whereas a revenue procedure provides return filing or other instructions concerning the IRS position. For example, a revenue ruling holds that taxpayers may deduct certain automobile expenses, and a revenue procedure provides that taxpayers entitled to deduct these automobile expenses may compute them by applying certain mileage rates in lieu of determining actual operating expenses. Revenue rulings and revenue procedures are alike in that both are issued only by the National Office and both are for the information and guidance of taxpayers.

The party did not contest the next election in 2007 and only ran its leader as a candidate in 2011. It eventually transformed itself into an organisation instead of a party having never attained a seat in the Bermuda Parliament. Twenty-four-year-old artist and musician Gavin Sundjata Smith, the only known member, created the GLP with the assistance of his brother Corin, a former member of the youth wing of the Progressive Labour Party and future United Bermuda Party candidate, and used the name of a type of local dancer, the Gombey, to attract interest in the party.  Platform  Under the slogan, \\"The Power of One\\", the GLP's political platform ‚Äî directed towards the Bermudian youth ‚Äî revolved around removing the remnants of colonialism and British influence from Bermuda. Much of this influence comes in the form of the Governor of Bermuda, whom Smith claimed was consolidating his power ‚Äî backed by a conservative neo-colonial movement ‚Äî over the Bermuda Police Service, the Bermuda Regiment and the legal and banking systems. GLP intended to use \\"therapeutic\\" instead of \\"adversarial\\" measures to attain its goals, including civic engagement and a balance between \\"grassroots values\\" and \\"establishment priorities\\": Grassroots values * Faith * Family * Fulfillment * Fairness * Freedom * Fun * Flexibility * Unity Establishment priorities * Ideology * Bureaucracy * Necessity * Force * Control * Protocol * Efficiency * Order Other goals included the rejuvenation of local culture through the establishment of \\"culture centres\\" on several derelict sites.Johnson, Ayo. \\"GLP targets destructive policies of the past\\", The Royal Gazette, July 10, 2003 More ambitious proposals included relocating the Bermuda International Airport and redeveloping St. George's historic forts for a variety of purposes, as well as initiating truth and reconciliation.Johnson, Ayo. \\"GLP platform builds on its East End roots\\", The Royal Gazette, July 18, 2003  Public response  Though many individuals found Smith and the GLP an entertaining concept, few took him seriously. Of those that did was a section who responded with great hostility, including threats to Smith's family. The origin of this hostility is attributed by some to the use of the phrase \\"Gombey\\" and the fact that the GLP was running against then-Premier Jennifer Smith.Johnson, Ayo. \\"Gombey Liberation Party leader feels hard knocks of politics\\", The Royal Gazette, July 19, 2003  2003 election  During the 2003 general election, founder Gavin Smith was the party's only candidate and ran for the St. George's North constituency, against the PLP's then-Premier Jennifer Smith and the UBP's Kenneth Bascome. He received 16 votes, or about 0.2% of the ballots cast, compared to J. Smith's 423 and Bascome's 415. G. Smith's final count was the lowest of the election, followed by 41 votes for the National Liberal Party's lone candidate Graeme Outerbridge, and 51 votes for the lone independent candidate Stuart Hayward, both of whom were more publicly known than Smith. In fact, these three, and one each from the two main parties, were the only candidates to receive fewer than a hundred votes.

They are widely distributed in South America. Some species are notable as the vectors of Argentinian hemorrhagic fever and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. The genus was originally named Hesperomys, but was changed to Calomys since 1962. History Hesperomys was introduced by George Robert Waterhouse in 1839 for the American rodents with cusps arranged in two series. The name combines the Greek ·ºëœÉœÄŒµœÅŒøœÇ \\"west\\" and ŒºœÖœÇ \\"mouse\\". He considered it possible that species of Hesperomys would be found in the Old World, but did not doubt that the Americas were their chief abode.Hershkovitz, 1962, p. 129; Waterhouse, 1839, p. 75 He included as species Mus bimaculatus (=Calomys laucha), Mus griseo- flavus (=Graomys griseoflavus), Mus Darwinii (=Phyllotis darwini), Mus zanthopygus (=Phyllotis xanthopygus), Mus galapagoensis (=Aegialomys galapagoensis), Symidon hispidum (=Sigmodon hispidus), Mus leucopus (=Peromyscus leucopus), and the woodrats (Neotoma).Waterhouse, 1839, pp. 75‚Äì76; current nomenclature: Musser and Carleton, 2005; Weksler et al., 2006 In following years, authors like Johann Andreas Wagner and Spencer Fullerton Baird expanded the genus to include additional American species, such as those placed now in Scapteromys, Oxymycterus, Abrothrix, and Peromyscus. In 1874, Elliott Coues designated Mus bimaculatus Waterhouse as the type species of Hesperomys.Hershkovitz, 1962, p. 129 In 1888, Herluf Winge used Hesperomys in a sense similar to modern Calomys (but confusingly placed species related to what is now known as Oryzomys in Calomys), but in the same year Oldfield Thomas argued that Hesperomys could not be separated from the hamsters (Cricetus). In 1896, however, he united it with Eligmodontia instead, where it remained until he reinstated it for modern Calomys in 1916. He did not use Calomys (introduced by Waterhouse in 1837 for Mus bimaculatus), because he thought it to be preoccupied by an earlier name Callomys d'Orbigny and Geoffroy, 1830.Hershkovitz, 1962, p. 130 In 1962, Philip Hershkovitz noted that the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature mandates that a name cannot be considered preoccupied even when it differs by only one letter from another, so Callomys cannot invalidate Calomys. As Calomys Waterhouse, 1837, and Hesperomys Waterhouse, 1839, both had Mus bimaculatus as their type species, the two are objective synonyms and the older name, Calomys, prevails; since then, Hesperomys has no longer been in use as a valid name.

He was the Navy's senior administrator as well as its fleet commander in 1917-18. Background Njegovan was born in 1858 in Agram (now Zagreb). Upon graduation from the Imperial and Royal Naval Academy in Fiume (now Rijeka), he joined the fleet in Pola (Pula) in 1877 as a Seekadett. In 1893, after receiving a short instructional course as torpedo officer of Alpha, he received his first command, the torpedo boat Condor. At the Naval Academy he was an instructor in seamanship from 1898 to 1905. Njegovan then held command of the battleship Budapest until 1907. He served from 1907 to 1909 as chief of staff to the Marinekommandant (Navy Commander), Rudolf Montecuccoli, and as adjutant and chief of operations of the Marinesektion (Naval Section of the War Ministry), of which Montecuccoli was Chef (Chief). He was promoted to Kontreadmiral in 1911 and Vizeadmiral in 1913. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he was named commander of the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, hoisting his flag in the dreadnought battleship Tegetthoff. Njegovan was decorated with the Order of Leopold for his bombardment of Ancona the night Italy declared war on the empire, 23/24 May 1915. Fleet Commander SMS Tegetthoff In February 1917 he succeeded the late Grossadmiral Anton Haus as Marinekommandant and as Flottenkommandant (Fleet Commander). Promoted to full Admiral, he was appointed to the additional post of Chef der Marinesektion in April 1917, succeeding the late Karl Kailer von Kaltenfels. Njegovan was the last man to hold all three posts. He received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Iron Crown for the battle of the Otranto Straits, 14/15 May 1917. Njegovan continued Haus' strategy of preserving his major forces as a 'fleet in being'. However, he was unable to ease ethnic tensions on individual warships, where sailors were also influenced by radical agitators. Another pressing problem for which Njegovan could find no solution involved shortages of food, fuel and other vital supplies. In the face of such difficulties, in 1917 Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and Kaiser Karl I of Austria proposed an unrealistic plan for an invasion of Venice using the whole fleet. Njegovan steadfastly opposed the proposal, which eventually was dropped. The abortive communist-inspired mutiny at Cattaro (Kotor) in February 1918 underscored the need for a more energetic fleet commander. Relieved of command, Njegovan was succeeded as Flottenkommandant by Mikl√≥s Horthy and as Chef der Marinesektion by Franz von Holub. The office of Marinekommandant was left vacant. Retired on 1 March 1918, Njegovan spent the rest of the war in Pola. Pensioned and promoted to Grossadmiral on the retired list, he was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold (Austria) for his services to the empire.  Postwar  After the war, Njegovan lived for a time in Venice. His homeland of Croatia had become part of the new nation of Yugoslavia, and in 1930 he died in his hometown of Zagreb at the age of 71. He is buried in Mirogoj cemetery.

Subject  The painting depicts the young Jesus assisting Joseph in his workshop. Joseph is making a door, which is laid upon his carpentry work-table. Jesus has cut his hand on an exposed nail, symbolizing the stigmata and foreshadowing Jesus' crucifixion. Some of the blood has fallen onto his foot. As Jesus' grandmother, Anne, removes the nail with a pair of pincers, his concerned mother, Mary, offers her cheek for a kiss. Joseph examines Jesus' wounded hand. A young boy, who would later be known as John the Baptist, brings in water to wash the wound, prefiguring his later baptism of Christ. An assistant of Joseph, who represents Jesus' future Apostles, observes these events. In the background of the painting various objects are used to further symbolize the theological significance of the subject. A ladder, referring to Jacob's Ladder, leans against the back wall, and a dove which represents the Holy Spirit rests on it. Other carpentry implements refer to the Holy Trinity. Millais likely used Albrecht D√ºrer's print Melancholia I as a source for this imagery, along with quattrocento works. The sheep in the sheepfold seen through the door represent the future Christian flock. It has been suggested that Millais was influenced by John Rogers Herbert's painting Our Saviour Subject to His Parents at Nazareth. He may also have drawn on a painting depicting Jesus helping Joseph in his workshop, which at the time was attributed to Annibale Carracci.Catherine Roach, The Artist in the House of His Patron: Images-within-Images in John Everett Millais's Portraits of the Wyatt Family, Visual Culture in Britain, 1 July, 2008 1, 1 March 2010, pp.67 ‚Äì 92  Critical response  The painting was immensely controversial when first exhibited because of its realistic depiction of a carpentry workshop, especially the dirt and detritus on the floor. This was in dramatic contrast to the familiar portrayal of Jesus, his family, and his apostles in costumes reminiscent of Roman togas. Charles Dickens accused Millais of portraying Mary as an alcoholic who looks > ...so hideous in her ugliness that ... she would stand out from the rest of > the company as a Monster, in the vilest cabaret in France, or the lowest > gin-shop in England. Critics also objected to the portrayal of Jesus, one complaining that it was \\"painful\\" to see \\"the youthful Saviour\\" depicted as \\"a red-headed Jew boy\\".\\"The Royal Academy Exhibition.\\" Builder 1 Jun. 1850, 255‚Äì256. Dickens described him as a \\"wry-necked, blubbering red-headed boy in a bed-gown, who appears to have received a poke...playing in an adjacent gutter\\".Dickens, Charles. \\"Old Lamps for New Ones.\\" Household Words 12 (15 Jun. 1850), 12‚Äì14. Other critics suggested that the characters displayed signs of rickets and other disease associated with slum conditions. Because of the controversy, Queen Victoria asked for the painting to be taken to Buckingham Palace so that she could view it in private.Tate Gallery, Teacher's pack At the Royal Academy the painting was exhibited with a companion piece by Millais's colleague, William Holman Hunt, that also portrayed a scene from early Christian history in which a family help a wounded individual. This was entitled A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids.  Consequences  The effect of the critical comments was to make the Pre-Raphaelite movement famous and to create a debate about the relationship between modernity, realism and medievalism in the arts. The critic John Ruskin supported Millais in letter to the press and in his lecture \\"Pre-Raphaelitism\\" despite personally disliking the painting. The painting's use of symbolic realism led to a wider movement in which the choice of composition and theme was combined with detailed observation.[The Symbolists' rejection of naturalism and narrative in favor of the subjective representation of an idea or emotion would have a significant effect on the artwork of the twentieth century, ...]  References  Category:Paintings by John Everett Millais Category:1850 paintings Category:Paintings depicting Jesus Category:Paintings of the Virgin Mary Category:Paintings depicting John the Baptist Category:Birds in art Category:Sheep in art Category:Paintings of Saint Joseph Category:Paintings of children ","title":"Christ in the House of His Parents"},{"id":"7684939","text":"was a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army in the early Second Sino-Japanese War. He was noted as the commander in many of the operations of the invasion of Manchuria. Biography The second son of a doctor in Shizuoka prefecture, Tamon graduated from the 11th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1898, and served in the Russo-Japanese War as a junior officer with the IJA 4th Infantry Regiment . After the end of the war, he graduated from the 21st class of the Army Staff College in 1909. He served as an instructor at the Army Academy, on the staff of the IJA 6th Division, and as a battalion commander of the IJA 62nd Infantry Regiment and as an instructor at the Staff College.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II He also published the field diary which he had kept during the Russo-Japanese War under the title Yo no Sanka Shitaru Nichiro Sen'eki (My Participation in the Russo-Japanese War). The book was aimed at new recruits to provide them with a glimpse of what they might expect in the event that they were called up in a future conflict, and proved to not only be a best-seller, but was also a model for future war diaries. After spending six months on tour in Europe, Tamon was assigned to the IJA 27th Infantry Regiment based in Vladivostok in 1920 as part of Japan's Siberian Intervention during the Russian Civil War. During the conflict, he was assigned an independent command (the ‚ÄúTamon Task Force‚Äù), which was part of the relief force for Nikolayevsk-on-Amur after the Nikolayevsk Incident.White, The Siberian Intervention Later, he was attached to the staff of the Sakhalin Expeditionary Force. Tamon commanded the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment from 1921 to 1922. He was then Chief of Staff of the IJA 4th Division form 1922 to 1924, at which time he was promoted to major general and was given command of IJA 6th Infantry Brigade. Tamon was Chief of the 4th Bureau of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from 1925 to 1927, and then returned to the Army War College, first as Director, then as Commandant in 1929. From 1930 to 1933, as lieutenant general, Tamon commanded IJA 2nd Division. In 1931, the division came under the control of the Kwantung Army in Manchuria, and took the lead in the initial operations of the invasion of Manchuria, then in the Jiangqiao Campaign, Chinchow Operation, and in overcoming the defense of Harbin, following the Mukden Incident.Matsusaka, The Making of Japanese Manchuria During interviews with western press following the successful completion of the campaign, he spoke out against criticism by the League of Nations, stating that European gentlemen were unaware of the need to restore peace and order in Manchuria. He returned to Japan in January 1933, and in August went into reserves. He died the next year.

It is located at 15.269 km from the starting point in Piraeus. The current station is built on a viaduct at the location of a train station on the former Lavriou Square-Strofyli railway line. The old station of Attica Railways was opened on February 4, 1885, and closed down on August 8, 1938, pending electrification. The railway level crossing, which was replaced with a viaduct when the line was electrified, gave the location its old name Alyssida. The station was converted to standard gauge and was opened as part of the extension of Hellenic Electric Railways to Kifissia in February 1956. The station has two platforms and a reversing siding located between the up and down lines, which can connect to either track, so it can be used as a terminal station if needed. Ano Patissia station was actually used until 1985 as the northern terminus of a local service Thision-Patisia, to improve the service in the central part of the line. After a recent renovation for the 2004 Olympic Games, the station features escalators and lifts for the disabled.

There are four main species of Erinaceus. The range is all across Europe, throughout the Middle East, parts of Russia, and extending to northern China. Some of the European hedgehogs have been introduced to New Zealand.Macdonald, David W. The Encyclopedia of Mammals. New York, NY: Facts on File, 1984 . Description As is characteristic of other hedgehogs, members of Erinaceus have spines. These spines are a modification of the hair that is formed and strengthened by keratin. They contain hollow air filled gaps separated by thin inner layers of the spine to lessen the weight load.Grzimek, Bernhard, Neil Schlager, Donna Olendorf, and Melissa C. McDade. Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2004. Every spine is tapered at the end to form a point and also at the base where it then forms a bulb that is attached to the skin. The tapering at the base allows the spine to have a section that will bend under stress and dampen forces placed on the spines. Each of the spines has a dermal muscle that erects the spine for defense. The size of Erinaceus is 20‚Äì30 cm with a weight of 400‚Äì1200 g.Lal, S. S. Practical Zoology Vertebrate. Meerut, IN: Global Media, 2010. Behavior Like all other hedgehogs Erinaceus is nocturnal and seeks shelter in shrubs and burrows during the day.Qumsiyeh, Mazin B. Mammals of the Holy Land. Lubbock: Texas Tech UP, 1996 . The common defense mechanism is to roll into a ball with the spines facing outward. The action is done because of excess loose skin on the back of hedgehogs allows them to pull it around the rest of their body forming a ball. The first step is to pull skin fold over the head and rear of the body. Once this is done a muscle that runs along the edges of the animal called the panniculus carnosus contracts pulling everything in like a drawstring. Like most hedgehogs Erinaceus is solitary until breeding season. Another normal action is self-anointing where the organism produces thick foamy saliva and proceeds to cover its spines with the saliva. This could be in response to a chemical signal and often is done when a new object is introduced. The reason for self-anointing is unknown and believed to be either part of a defense or attraction of a mate. Hibernation is common in each of the species for Erinaceus. Most have the ability to lower the body temperature close that of the environmental temperature. In particular Erinaceus europaeus the body temperature can drop down to 1 ¬∞C and lower its heart rate down to 22 beats per minute. Reproduction and lifespan It is believed that Erinaceus is polygynous in mating. Once fertilized gestation is between 30‚Äì40 days. Upon birth the young are born blind and dependent to their mother. The average liter size is 2‚Äì5 offspring with a maximum of 10. Offspring are born without developed spines, which form within a few weeks. Weaning occurs around 4‚Äì6 weeks. Sexual maturity is reached around 12 months. The average life span is 2‚Äì5 years while in captivity lifespan can reach as much as 10 years. Diet Erinaceus is an omnivore. It will eat small invertebrates, small vertebrates, fruit, vegetables, and even fungi. In some cases they have been known to eat venomous snakes or even toxic beetles. Some species show resistance to snake venom up to forty times greater than that of the ordinary laboratory mouse.

Wang Wei advised Hou Jing during the latter's time as general and was elevated to prime minister during Hou's time in power. Although Wang Wei was successful as an adviser and strategist, he was captured and executed by Hou Jing's enemy, Xiao Yi after Hou's defeat and retreat east.  As Hou Jing's chief strategist  Wang was from Yingchuan Commandery (ÊΩÅÂ∑ù, roughly modern Xuchang, Henan). His ancestors were from L√ºeyang Commandery (Áï•ÈôΩ, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu), but as his father Wang L√ºe (ÁéãÁï•) served as the county magistrate of Xuchang County (Ë®±Êòå, Yingchuan Commandery's seat), the family remained in Yingchuan. Wang himself was known for his knowledge of the I Ching and for his beautiful writing style, and he served as a secretary under Hou Jing while Hou was put in charge of the provinces south of the Yellow River by the paramount general of Eastern Wei, Gao Huan. In 547, after Gao Huan died, Hou, who was a friend of Gao Huan's but had a running dispute with Gao Huan's son and heir Gao Cheng, rebelled against Eastern Wei. Wang Wei became one of Hou's chief strategists and propagandists. When Gao Cheng read the declarations that Wang wrote on Hou's behalf, he was very impressed, and commented that his staff members should have been aware of Wang's talent and recruited him. Hou subsequently surrendered the provinces he controlled to Liang, but both he and the Liang force commanded by Emperor Wu of Liang's nephew Xiao Yuanming were defeated by the Eastern Wei general Murong Shaozong (ÊÖïÂÆπÁ¥πÂÆó). Xiao Yuanming was captured, and Hou lost the provinces he controlled and was forced to flee to Liang. Emperor Wu allowed Hou to control the important border city of Shouyang. In summer of 548, believing that Emperor Wu was ready to betray him so that Xiao Yuanming would be returned, Hou rebelled against Liang after being encouraged by Wang ‚Äì who pointed out that whether he rebelled or not, he faced death. Subsequently, with Wang's advice, Hou surprised Emperor Wu ‚Äì who had sent his son, Xiao Guan (Ëï≠Á∂∏) the Prince of Shaoling to attack Hou ‚Äì by leaving Shouyang before Xiao Guan could approach and attacked the capital Jiankang directly. Hou was able to reach Jiankang with minimal resistance, and after capturing the outer city, put the palace under siege. Throughout the siege, Wang continued to serve as chief advisor and propagandist as well as negotiator with Emperor Wu and his crown prince Xiao Gang. It was at Wang's advice that Hou, in 549, promised peace to Emperor Wu and Xiao Gang while obtaining additional food supplies, and the resumed the siege once he obtained the additional food. In spring 549, the palace fell, and Hou took control of Emperor Wu and Xiao Gang. Wang often served as the liaison between Hou and Emperor Wu and Xiao Gang. In summer 549, when Emperor Wu died, it was Wang who escorted Xiao Gang to the palace under Hou's orders, for Xiao Gang to succeed Emperor Wu (as Emperor Jianwen). During Emperor Jianwen's reign, Hou was actually in control, although most Liang provincial governors refused to follow Hou's orders (issued as imperial edicts by Emperor Jianwen). When Hou was away from the capital to attack those provincial governors, Wang stayed in Jiankang to defend the capital. In 550, when Hou was away on one such campaign, Emperor Wu's grandson Xiao Huili (Ëï≠ÊúÉÁêÜ) the Prince of Nankang tried to start a coup at Jiankang to kill Wang, but Wang discovered his plot and put him and his coconspirators to death. While Wang could not prove that Emperor Jianwen was involved, both he and Hou became more suspicious of Emperor Jianwen, notwithstanding that Hou had married Emperor Jianwen's daughter Princess Liyang. Nevertheless, Hou continued to favor Princess Liyang greatly, and Wang, feeling that he was spending too much time with her and not enough time on important matters of state, advised him to spend less time with her. However, this brought Wang into conflict with the princess, and she argued with him. Fearing that Hou would turn against him at the princess' urging, Wang instead advised Hou to get rid of the emperor.  As Hou Jing's prime minister  Hou did not act against Emperor Jianwen immediately, but in autumn 551, after his campaign against Emperor Jianwen's brother Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong ‚Äì then the strongest remaining Liang prince ‚Äì ended in disaster, he feared for his safety and wanted to seize the throne immediately. Wang persuaded him that before doing so, he needed to demonstrate his power by deposing the emperor. Hou therefore did so, replacing Emperor Jianwen with his grandnephew Xiao Dong, the Prince of Yuzhang. One and a half months later, at Wang's urging, Hou sent Wang to kill Emperor Jianwen. Wang carried it out by first feasting with Emperor Jianwen (who had already known his intent), and then, after Emperor Jianwen became drunk, suffocating him. A month later, Hou forced Xiao Dong to yield the throne to him, establishing a state of Han. Wang was made the prime minister, and it was at his urging that Hou built temples to worship his ancestors, pursuant to Confucian tradition. Because Hou did not know his ancestors' names beyond his grandfather's, Wang had to make up names for them. Wang also tried to curb Hou's frivolous behavior, although this made Hou depressed.  After Hou Jing's defeat  In spring 552, after Xiao Yi's generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian reached Jiankang and defeated Hou, Wang Wei advised Hou to defend the palace against a potential siege, but Hou instead abandoned Jiankang and fled east. After Hou fled, Wang Wei fled separately with the generals Hou Zijian (‰æØÂ≠êÈëí) and Chen Qing (Èô≥ÊÖ∂), trying to get to Guangling (Âª£Èôµ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) to join another general, Guo Yuanjian (ÈÉ≠ÂÖÉÂª∫). However, on the way, Wang Wei became lost and separated from Hou Zijian. He was instead captured by the army commander Huang Gongxi (ÈªÉÂÖ¨Âñú) and delivered to Jiankang. Wang Sengbian rebuked him for fleeing and not dying for his emperor, and Wang, alluding to an incident where Hou had allowed Wang Sengbian to flee, instead responded, \\"Success and failure had already been determined by heaven. If Hou had accepted my suggestion to detain you, how would you have this success?\\" Wang Sengbian laughed and was impressed with Wang Wei's fortitude in his response, and only imprisoned him, awaiting instructions from Xiao Yi on what to do. While imprisoned, Wang Wei wrote poems to Xiao Yi's associates and Xiao Yi himself, hoping that his talent could impress them enough to spare him. Xiao Yi was initially inclined to spare him, but Wang Wei's enemies instead told Xiao Yi to read one of the propaganda pieces that Wang Wei had written for Hou. Xiao Yi, who was blind in one eye and sensitive about his blind eye, read: Insulted, Xiao Yi ordered that Wang Wei be put to death in a cruel manner.The two main official historical sources differ in their accounts on how Wang Wei was put to death. The Book of Liang recorded that Wang was boiled to death. The History of Southern Dynasties recorded that Wang had his tongue pierced and nailed to a column, and that his intestines were pulled out. It also recorded that his enemies cut off his flesh and showed him his own flesh, and that he was then beheaded after he had been reduced to bones. It was said that as he was being executed, Wang's countenance did not change.

Smidt was a son of the Reformed preacher Johann Smidt sen., pastor at St. Stephen Church in Bremen. Smidt jun. studied theology in Jena, and was one of the founders of the Gesellschaft der freien M√§nner (Community of free men). He was ordained Reformed preacher in Z√ºrich in 1797. He then became Professor of History at the Gymnasium illustre in his hometown. He then became 'Syndikus' (company lawyer) for the √Ñlterleute (aldermen, Bremen's merchants corporation of constitutional rank) and in 1800 'Ratsherr' (councilman), a position in which he exerted considerable influence on the governmental and commercial development of the cities of the Hanseatic League. In particular as he acted as Bremen's diplomatic representative at the Congress of Vienna and preserved the independence of the Hanseatic cities and put through their acceptance into the German Confederation of sovereign states after the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. In the final revision of the decisions of the Congress on the rights of the Jews, Smidt - unauthorised and unconsented by the other parties - changed the text from \\"The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them in the confederal states\\", by replacing the single word \\"in\\", which ensued serious consequences, into: \\"The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them by the confederal states.\\"In the German original: \\"Es werden den Bekennern des j√ºdischen Glaubens die denselben in [von, respectively] den einzelnen Bundesstaaten bereits einger√§umten Rechte erhalten.\\" Cf. Heinrich Graetz, Geschichte der Juden von den √§ltesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart: 11 vols., Leipzig: Leiner, 1900, vol. 11: 'Geschichte der Juden vom Beginn der Mendelssohnschen Zeit (1750) bis in die neueste Zeit (1848)', p. 317. Emphasis not in the original. Reprint of the edition last time revised by the author himself: Berlin: arani, 1998, . In the Confederation's Bundesversammlung, he battled the politics of Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Metternich, and was particularly involved in the negotiations which in 1820 established free shipping on the Weser. Above all, he gave Bremen's commerce an important impulse through the foundation of Bremerhaven in 1827 and by closing advantageous trade agreements with foreign countries, through widening of consular representation, etc. In 1821 he became B√ºrgermeister (mayor) of Bremen and he held this post -- apart from the democratic period of 1849-1852 -- until his death. Smidt was a devout member of the Reformed church, then Bremen's state church, merged only in 1873 with Lutheran congregations to form today's Bremian Evangelical Church. He worked against tolerating other religions and denominations within the city. Inglorious was Smidt's anti-Judaism. As burgomaster, Smidt made the \\"complete expulsion of the children of Israel\\" an \\"urgent concern of the state\\" since 1821. Jews had settled within the city during its incorporation into the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia (1807-1810) and afterwards into France (1810-1813), when all inhabitants had become French citizens of equal status. All this ended in 1813/1815. Since it was the French state and not the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, which had emancipated the Jews in Bremen, the city took the altered formulation of the Viennese decisions as the legal grounds to revoke - as did a number of confederal states - the emancipation of the Jews in its territory. In 1826, Smidt had met his goal with the exception of two 'Schutzjuden' taken over from neighbouring Hanover. Also Bremen's Lutheran congregation, owning and using the Bremen Cathedral, experienced Smidt's steady badgering. The cathedral district, a former immunity district, used to be an extraterritorial enclave of the neighboured state of Bremen-Verden until 1803, when it was incorporated into the Free Imperial City of Bremen. As burgomaster Smidt confiscated the considerable estates of the Lutheran congregation, arguing it would be a legal non-thing, null and void. The representatives of the Lutheran congregation, led by the cathedral preacher Johann David Nicolai, started to fight for its right to exist. The fight lasted until the congregation's official recognition in 1830, asserted by a majority of Bremen's senators (government members) against the expressed will of Smidt.Johann Christian Bosse and Hans Henry Lamotte, Der Dom zu Bremen, 6th ed., Munich and Berlin: Deutscher Kunstverlag, 1990, (Gro√üe Baudenkm√§ler; No. 340), pp. 12seq. Smidt abused his governmental power to suppress the Lutheran congregation by way of ordinances, confiscation and public discreditation. Smidt dedicated himself to close cooperation between the Hanseatic cities. In 'Anerkennung der Hilfe nach dem gro√üen Hamburger Brand' (acknowledgement after the great Hamburg fire) in 1843, he was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg. Smidt's son Heinrich Smidt (1806‚Äì1878), a studied lawyer, also served Bremen as senator and archivist.

The Jewish and Arab populations of Mandatory Palestine and later the Israeli and Jordanian armies fought for control of Jerusalem. Under the UN Partition Plan, Jerusalem was to be placed under international rule in a corpus separatum. Fighting nevertheless immediately broke out in the city between Jewish and Arab militias, with bombings and attacks by both sides. Starting in February 1948, Arab militia under Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni blockaded the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, preventing the supply of the Jewish population. This blockade was broken in mid-April by Operation Nachshon and Operation Maccabee. On 14 May and the following days, Etzioni and Harel brigades supported by Irgun troops launched several operations aiming to take over the Arab side of the city. In the meantime, the Arab Legion had deployed in the area of Palestine dedicated to the Arab state, not entering the Corpus separatum but massively garrisoning Latrun to blockade West Jerusalem once again. Israeli victories against the Arab militias in the city pushed Abdallah of Jordan to order the Arab Legion to intervene. It deployed in East Jerusalem, fought the Israelis and took the Jewish quarter of the Old City. The population was expelled and the fighters taken prisoners to Jordan. The Israeli forces launched three assaults on Latrun to free the road to the city but without success. Israeli forces built an alternative road to Jerusalem before the truce imposed by UN on 11 June, breaking the blockade. During the period called the First Truce, West Jerusalem was supplied with food, ammunition, weapons and troops. Fighting didn't resume during the remaining months of the 1948 war. The city was split between Israel and Jordan after the war, Israel ruling West Jerusalem and Jordan ruling East Jerusalem with the Old City. Overview Aside from the large Jewish population, Jerusalem held special importance to the Yishuv for \\"religious and nationalist\\" reasons. Blockade at Latrun and Bab al-Wad  Arabs attack the commercial center 2.12.1947 Bomb attack by Irgun on 29.12.1947 Palmach soldiers attack the San Simon monastery in Katamon, Jerusalem, April 1948 (battle reconstruction) plundering of the Jewish Quarter after its inhabitants' expulsion Following the outbreak of disturbances at the end of 1947 the road between Tel Aviv and Jewish Jerusalem became increasingly difficult for Jewish vehicles. Arab forces tried to cut off the road to Jerusalem from the coastal plain, where the majority of the Jewish population resided. The Arabs blocked access to Jerusalem \\"at Latrun and Bab al-Wad,\\" a narrow valley surrounded by Arab villages on hills on both sides. The breaking of the siege of Jerusalem and the annexation of the captured areas to the Jewish state became primary goals for the Israelis in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Ambushes by Palestinian Arab irregulars became more frequent and more sophisticated. The intention of the besieging forces was to isolate the 100,000 Jewish residents of the city from the rest of the Jewish inhabitants of Palestine and, in the case of the Jordanian forces, to capture East Jerusalem (including the Old City). In December 1947 the Jewish Agency set up the Jerusalem Emergency Committee, headed by Dov Yosef, which stockpiled food and fuel. In January the Committee estimated 4,500 tons a month was needed. They were given 50,000 Palestine pounds credit with the Histadrut's wholesalers, Hamashbir Hamerkazi. In January 1948 the number of trucks supplying Jewish Jerusalem had fallen to thirty per day. By March the daily average number of trucks reaching Jerusalem was six. By the end of March it was clear that food supplies for civilians in Jewish Jerusalem would run out. On 1 April The Times estimated that the Jewish population of Jerusalem required a minimum of 50 truckloads per week. On 3 April, The Scotsman reported that a spokesman at a meeting of Arab military leaders in Damascus had announced that Jerusalem would be \\"strangled\\" by a blockade. One estimate of the size of the opposing forces at the beginning of March 1948 gives the Arabs 5,300 men in Jerusalem and surrounding district, including 300 Iraqi irregulars and 60 Yugoslav Moslems. Jewish forces included the Haganah's Etzioni Brigade of 1,200 with another 1,200 second line troops, commanded by David Shaltiel. In addition there was a Jewish Home Guard of 2,500, and 500 members of the dissident organisations, Irgun and Lehi. Operation Nachshon In a tactical change from defensive to offensive action, in early April the Haganah was ordered to launch Operation Nachshon, an offensive to clear the strategic hilltop villages along the last few miles of the road to Jerusalem. At the same time a series of massive armoured convoys, involving hundreds of vehicles, forced their way through. The fighting led to the evacuation of the Jewish villages of Atarot (17 May) and Neve Yaakov (18 May) near Jerusalem, and Kalya and Beit HaArava near the Dead Sea (both on 20 May), as well as the expulsion of the Jewish inhabitants of the Old City of Jerusalem. The defenders of the Jewish Quarter surrendered to the Arab Legion on 28 May 1948, this leading to the forced evacuation of all Jewish inhabitants. =Convoys= View of the road to Jerusalem entering Bab al-Wad seen from the Arab Legion positions at Latrun Dov Yosef listed the problems faced in relieving Jewish Jerusalem as: * The lack of heavy war equipment such as planes and artillery. * The nature of the terrain. * The density of Arab population. * No Jewish settlements in the area. In addition there was the British ban on the carrying of weapons. On 17 March six members of the Palmach accompanying a convoy were killed in a clash with the British Army. At the end of March the decision was taken to resist arms searches. On 17 March a 16-vehicle convoy reached the city without incident.Rose, Pauline. The Siege of Jerusalem. Patmos Publishers, London. No date. Introduction dated June 1949. Page 31. But the following week a two-mile long, 80-vehicle convoy came under attack, and five passengers were killed. Dov Yosef refers to a convoy being \\"wiped out\\", 27 March, but gives no details. Two days later a 60-vehicle convoy came under attack at Hulda and was forced to turn back with 17 Jews and 5 Arabs killed. Five captured vehicles were driven to Ramle.The Times. 1 & 2 April 1948. A food convoy escorted by the Palmach reached the city on 6 April without casualties despite being ambushed at Dir Muhsein by a force of \\"150 Arabs ... joined by 80 Arabs from Abu Shushe.\\" It also survived a second road block at Kolonia taking six hours to reach its destination. To coincide with Nachshon, Dov Yosef was given ¬£100,000 and Haganah authority to conscript as many men and trucks as he needed. He proceeded to assemble three large convoys at Bilu Camp with a stockpile of 10,000 tons of supplies. He obtained 150 trucks from the Solel Boneh - Shelev Transport Co-operative. A Haganah field force requisitioned a further 150 trucks with their drivers and conscripted 1,000 men as labourers. On 15 April 131 trucks with 550 tons of food reached the city without being attacked. The supplies included 230 tons of flour and 800 pounds of chocolate. Two days later 300 trucks arrived in the Jewish enclave with 1,000 tons of supplies, also without incident. The third convoy on 20 April had a harder time. Consisting of 300 trucks with 2,000 Haganah and Irgun troops, the convoy battled all day to get through. Twenty trucks were knocked out, ten Jews were killed and 30 wounded.The Times, 21 April. Erev Pesach Also, during Nachshon, there was a secret convoy that brought 1,500 Palmach soldiers into the city. After this Jewish Jerusalem was cut off from the outside world for seven weeks, with the exception of a dozen trucks which brought army supplies on 17 May. =Food rationing= Mathematics professor Michael Fekete, the Provost of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, with his water quota, during the siege. Starting in early 1948, the Arab forces had severed the supply line to Jewish Jerusalem. On 31 March, Dov Yosef introduced a draconian system of food rationing. The bread ration was 200 grams per person. The April Passover week ration per person was 2 lb potatoes, 2 eggs, 0.5 lb fish, 4 lb matzoth, 1.5 oz dried fruit, 0.5 lb meat and 0.5 lb matza flour. The meat cost one Palestine pound per pound. On 12 May, water rationing was introduced. The ration was two gallons/person/day, of which four pints was drinking water. In June the weekly ration per person was 100 grams of wheat, 100 g beans, 40 g cheese, 100 g coffee or 100 g powdered milk, 160 g bread per day, 50 g margarine with one or two eggs for the sick. The mallow plant played an important role in Jerusalem history at this time. When convoys bearing foodstuffs could not reach the city, the residents of Jerusalem went out to the fields to pick mallow leaves, which are rich in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking mallow. When the broadcasts were picked up in Jordan, they sparked victory celebrations. Radio Amman announced that the fact that the Jews were eating leaves, which was food for donkeys and cattle, was a sign that they were dying of starvation and would soon surrender.Consumption of mallow End of the siege and truces Convoy bringing food and supplies to besieged Jerusalem passing Lifta On 27 March an attack on a convoy returning from the Gush Etzion settlement block south of Jerusalem left 15 Jews dead. In April, shortly after the Jewish attack on the Arab village of Deir Yassin west of Jerusalem which caused many civilian casualties, Arab forces attacked a Jewish medical convoy on its way to Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus. The British had provided no escort (as they had in previous months) and both they and Palmach forces were slow to intervene during the attack and help the ambushed Jews. After seven hours of fighting, the British put an end to the standoff; by then 78 Jews (mostly unarmed medical personnel) had been killed, as was one British soldier.Fighting Jack Churchill survived a wartime odyssey beyond compare, Robert Barr Smith, World War II History, July 2005.Hadassah marches on According to Dov Yosef the turning point of Operation Nachshon was the death of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni on 8 April. 30,000 people attended his funeral at the Haram al-Sharif and subsequently the morale of his forces collapsed. The end of the siege came with the opening of the \\"Burma Road\\" in June. In Yosef's words, \\"by the time the first truce (11 June 1948) came it had already broken the siege.\\" This alternative route had been conceived in April after the failure of Nachshon to secure the entrance to the road to Jerusalem at Latrun. Work started on 18 May using bulldozers and several hundred quarrymen from Jerusalem. The major problem was a very steep section at the beginning of the ascent. After two weeks some supplies came through using mules and 200 men from the Home Guard (Mishmar Ha'am) to cover the three miles which were impassable to vehicles. These men, mostly conscripts in their fifties, each carried a 45-pound load and made the trip twice a night. This effort lasted for five nights. Three weeks later, 10 June, the steepest section was opened to vehicles, though they needed assistance from tractors to get up it. By the end of June the usual nightly convoy delivered 100 tons of supplies a night. Harry Levin in his diary entry, 7 June, says that 12 tons a night were getting through and he estimated that the city needed 17 tons daily. On 28 July he notes that during the first truce, 11 June to 8 July, 8,000 truckloads arrived. This remained the sole supply route for several months until the opening of the Valor Road (Kvish Hagevurah). In late May and early June the Israelis launched several assaults on the Latrun salient but without success. During Operation Dani they launched two other attacks on Latrun, again without success and attacked several Arab villages to widen Jerusalem corridor that was 2 km wide in the area of Latrun. United Nations position Part of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which the Jews of Mandatory Palestine accepted and the Arabs of Mandatory Palestine and neighboring states rejected, was that Jerusalem would be a corpus separatum, under United Nations control and not part of either the proposed Arab or Jewish states. Israel argued that the partition plan regarding Jerusalem was \\"null and void\\" due to the UN's \\"active relinquishing of responsibility in a critical hour\\" when the UN did not act to protect the city.\\"Jerusalem Day.\\" The Knesset Website. 2003. 17 July 2011.

They belong to the tribe Charaxini, which also includes the nawab butterflies (Polyura). Charaxes are tropical Old World butterflies, with by far the highest diversity in sub- Saharan Africa, a smaller number from South Asia to Melanesia and Australia, and a single species (C. jasius) in Europe. They are generally strong flyers and very popular among butterfly collectors. Etymology Charaxes means \\"to sharpen\\" or \\"to make pointed\\", referring to the pointed 'tails' on the hind wing. Charaxes may also be related to charax, meaning 'a sharp stake', or charaxis, a 'notch' or 'incision', which are also features of the hind wing. Biology Charaxes frequent sunny forest openings and glades where they rest with open or partly open wings sunning themselves. When alerted, they close the wings exposing the cryptic underside. Certain favoured perches are selected and intruders are chased and driven off, Charaxes feed in part at oozes from tree wounds infested with beetle or other larvae and on rotting fruit (they come to hanging traps baited with fermenting banana). They lay their eggs on small understorey or marginal trees. Tender shoots are usually selected for egg laying but as the larvae grow they move to older leaves. Larvae rest on the upper surface of a leaf on which they have spun a protecting silk pad. Photograph from Schultze, 1917 Die charaxiden und apaturiden der kolonie Kamerun illustrating aspects of Charaxes biology The most striking features in the habits of Charaxes are the rapid flight, the partiality to putrid matter and the constancy with which a specimen returns to the same spot. Few species are found in the open country (C. pelias pelias, C. jasius and C. fabius), where there are only bushes and rarely trees; most species inhabit the more wooded country and some are found only in and near larger forests. The males come often in some numbers to water pools on roads; both sexes are fond of the juice of trees, decaying fruits, dung of animals and putrid meat and can successfully be entrapped by the use of such baits; one is known to come to flowers (C. zoolina). The larvae feed variously on Rhamnaceae, Leguminosae, Sapindaceae, Melianthaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Gramineae, Ochnaceae, Lauraceae, Tiliaceae, Meliaceae, etc. Charaxes acraeoides is part of a mimetic ring with Pseudacraea and Acraea. Life history \\"We have examined the eggs of a number of species, taken from the bodies of dry specimens. Apart from size, there is no apparent difference in the eggs of the various species. The micropyle end is flattened, slightly concave, with the centre raised; from the centre radiate slight ribs, which gradually disappear at the sides and do not reach the base or underside; the longitudinal ribs are connected by extremely feeble transverse ridges, and bear, as Doherty correctly points out, small projecting points, which are easily visible under a good lens. The slug-shaped caterpillar is widest in or before the middle, narrowed behind, and has a finely granulated skin. The head is flat, prognathous, and bears four processes which point backwards and are rough with tubercles, as is the hinder edge of the head between the processes; cheeks also tuberculated; the anal segment bears dorsally two more or less prominent processes, which are longer in the young larva than in the full-grown one. The colour of the larvae is generally green, often yellowish, the head bears, on each side, a light line which runs along the outer horn, and there is a spot on one or more abdominal segments, the colour of these latter markings, which are mostly more or less halfmoon-shaped, is as a rule buffish, the spots having often a darker (reddish or bluish) border. The caterpillar is a very slow creature, which does not voluntarily leave the twig on a leaf of which the egg was deposited. The thick chrysalis is bright green as a rule, very smooth and shining, dorsally very convex; head bluntly bipartite; end of abdomen with two rounded tubercles ventrally.\\"Rothschild, W. & Jordan, K.

Their wingspan is around 8 to 10 cm. The ground colours of the wing uppersides vary from tawny to black to pale. Wing markings may be spots, bars or bands of white, orange or blue. Some species have metallic blue spots and others have an overall iridescent, metallic gloss. Charaxes zingha is partially red and Charaxes eupale is light green. The males of the Charaxes etheocles complex are largely black and are known as the \\"black Charaxes\\". The outer margin of the forewing varies from being nearly straight to deeply concave. The hindwing is abdominally always longer than costally, and in most species presents a triangular shape. The teeth on the distal (or outer) margin of both wings vary much according to species and groups of species, and is also not entirely constant within a species. The anal angle (wing corner) is in many species more pronounced than the outer margin between the tails, best seen in Charaxes zingha. The pattern of the upperside is often very different in the sexes and in the various species. The females can be arranged according to the pattern of the upperside of the forewing into four groups: *Type 1: The discal and postdiscal interstices form a forked band, which is generally more or less interrupted at the veins into spots or patches. This is the normal type of female. There are many species in which the male has a similar band, but in this sex the patches composing the band are smaller than in the female. *Type 2: The upper discal interstitial patches become small or obsolete, while the postdiscal ones form together with the posterior discal ones an oblique band which extends from the costal to the internal margins. This type is found in both sexes of a number of species, and in the males of only a few others. *Type 3: The upper postdiscal interstitial spots are reduced in size or absent, while the discal interspaces and the posterior postdiscal ones form a broad curved band. This type does not occur in the male. *Type 4: The band is similar in appearance to that of type 3, but it is composed of the posterior postdiscal and discal interstices and the upper median ones, the band often entering the cell. This type is also confined to the female, and is met with only in one polychromatic species. The underside is sometimes very colourful with orange, grey and auburn silver areas. Sexual differences Sexual dimorphism is among Charaxes a much commoner phenomenon than similarity of the sexes in colour and shape. The wings of the female are always broader than those of the male, and the hindwing is, as a rule, less triangular; the tails are broader, often widened at the end; in some species the male has one, the female two tails, in other the tails of the male are obliterated (absent), while the female possesses such an appendage. Taxonomy The taxonomy is complex with very many ranks (subspecies, forms and variants) and Charaxes demonstrates both allopatric and sympatric speciation. Splitters, possibly with commercial as well as entomological interests, have named very many forms ‚Äì an example is Georges Rousseau-Decelle. \\"No group of African butterflies arouses stronger emotions than Charaxes.

Van Someren studied long series of museum specimens, drawing attention, as had his predecessors, to the variability of Charaxes species over their often vast range, identifying and describing subspecies and isolating new species. This clinal variation is complicated by variation associated with climate (season), altitude and mimicry. Van Someren recognizes species groups, the analysis is in part subjective and the number of taxa remains uncertain. The type species of the genus Charaxes is Charaxes jasius. Pg. 220 \\"Recognising this fact, Ochsenheimer (1816, Schmett. Europa, vol. 4) removed Papilio jasius from Paphia, and placed it instead in his own genus Charaxes, thus making P. jasius the type-species of the latter by monotypy.\\" Species groups Cladogram of the basal subdivision of the genus Charaxes and its nearest relatives Defining species groups is a convenient way of subdividing well-defined genera with a large number of recognized species. Charaxes species are so arranged in assemblages called \\"species groups\\" (not superspecies, but an informal phenetic arrangement). These may or may not be clades. As molecular phylogenetic studies continue, lineages distinct enough to warrant some formal degree of recognition become evident and new groupings are suggested, but consistent ranking remains a problem. Species In older literature, some of the nawab butterflies, such as Polyura dolon, may be included under Charaxes. =Species not found in the Afrotropical realm= *Charaxes affinis Butler, [1866] *Charaxes amycus C. & R.

Content =The song= \\"Censor\\" was originally released with the title \\"Dogshit\\" as the introductory song off of Skinny Puppy's 1988 album VIVIsectVI. Nettwerk, Skinny Puppy's record label at the time, suggested the change for the single's marketability. The decision to rename the song was ultimately the band's, and the title \\"Dogshit\\" still appears on the 12-inch's spine. Two main versions of \\"Censor\\" exist: the four-minute album mix and the ten-minute extended mix, both of which are featured on the single. Musically, the song begins with an extended intro with distorted, looped, and cut up samples. It then transitions into a multilayered blend of programmed industrial beats, fretless bass, and synthesizer sounds all overlaid with Nivek Ogre's enigmatic and intentionally grating vocals. The last third of the song introduces electric guitar and more electronic noise. The extended mix is deliberately sparser than the original version, and it features a number of new sounds and samples. Ogre's vocals do not enter the track until two and a half minutes in. =The single= Two additional songs originally from the CD versions of VIVIsectVI appear on the \\"Censor\\" single. Cofounding member cEvin Key thought of these tracks, \\"Punk in Park Zoo's\\" and \\"Yes He Ran\\", as a cross between the style of Skinny Puppy the style of some of his side projects, like Doubting Thomas. \\"Punk in Park Zoo's\\" is a short and aggressive song that features a different, more abrupt ending than that which appears on the VIVIsectVI compact disc. It is heavily distorted and noisy and was created during a jam when the band took a break from recording \\"Dogshit\\". \\"Yes He Ran\\" repeatedly employs a sample of Jim Morrison saying \\"everywhere\\".

It is built from Cockercombe tuff and is located near Aley in the parish of Over Stowey in Somerset. It has variously been used as an estate, a sanatorium and a school. History Quantock Lodge =The Estate= In 1833, Lord Taunton purchased the estates of Over Stowey from the Earl of Egmont, and added the estates of Nether Stowey in 1838, forming the estate of 'Over and Nether Stowey' or just the 'Quantock' estate, named after the nearby Quantock Hills. Lord Taunton was then the MP for nearby Taunton, and had been born in Over Stowey; he was later to become President of the Board of Trade, Chief Secretary for Ireland and Secretary of State for the Colonies, before his resignation from the House of Commons and his ennoblement as Baron Taunton in 1859. =The House= In 1857 Lord Taunton engaged Henry Clutton to construct a house for the estate, as a summer residence (Lord Taunton's primary residence was in Belgrave Square, where he died) and to house Lady Taunton's extensive art collection. This required the demolition of the hamlet of Aley Green, and was built in stages in the 1860s, and ultimately came to comprise the main house, stable-block, gatehouse and lodges. The main house has been described, perhaps unkindly, by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"a large rather dull Tudor house... Gothic Stables, a specially crazy Gothic Dovecote and a big Gothic Lodge on the Aisholt Road\\"; it comprised a library, great hall, billiards room and several other major rooms. The Cockercombe tuff necessary for construction was quarried on site. In 1869 on the death of Lord Taunton the house and estate passed to his eldest daughter, the Hon. Mary Labouchere, who married Edward Stanley (1826‚Äì1907) in 1872. Edward Stanley became an MP for West Somerset at a by-election in 1882, and represented the seat, and its successor, as a Conservative until 1906, making three contributions in parliamentary debates, typically on local issues. Edward Stanley had two sons, Henry Thomas Stanley and Edward Arthur Vesey Stanley. Henry was the elder and expected to inherit the estate. Henry was a keen cricketer, representing Somerset County Cricket Club in fifty first-class matches between 1894 and 1899. He had joined the West Somerset Yeomanry as an officer, but died in 1900 during the Second Boer War. As a memorial, Edward Stanley planted trees in the house's grounds in the formation of a cricketing eleven. After Henry's death, Edward Arthur Vesey Stanley, for whom the Quantock Staghounds had been founded in 1902, became heir and inherited the 8,000 acre estate after his father's death in 1907. In 1919 the estate, house and contents were sold at auction over eleven days to clear Edward's debts. =The Sanatorium= At the 1919 auction, the estate was divided, but the main house was bought by Somerset County Council under the Public Health Act 1913 to become the Quantock Sanatorium, along with 2,045 acres. The sanatorium lasted until 1961, when the rise of antibiotics rendered such treatment ineffectual. =The School= Quantock School Crest In the 1962 the house was purchased by David T. Peaster and made into a school in 1964, which he initially headed alongside Cotham School, Bristol, before the latter closed in 1966. The school preserved various traditions of the house, preserving Lord Taunton's arms as the school's crest, and adopting the phrase passibus citis sed novis as their motto. The school was run on traditional lines, and proved especially popular with diplomats and armed services personnel, not least since it was in the exclusive list of schools recommended by the Ministry of Defence. Within a few years of opening, it was described by the Gordonstoun Record as 'the Gordonstoun of the West' and the Daily Express termed it 'Britain's newest Public School'. The estate was gradually developed for educational purposes in this period, with the Patio Block and Sports Hall Block being constructed in the 1970s, and the Stable Block in the following decade. Similarly, to sustain the school's co-curricular activities, an all- weather pitch, tennis court and new heated swimming pool complex were built in the 1980s. In 1986 Quantock School became co-educational, but soon after the turn of the 1990s was in gradual decline, due in the main to the end of the Cold War and the subsequent closure of a number of overseas service bases, which in turn led to a drying up of new pupils. The hand-over of Hong Kong to China in 1997 also had a serious impact on the school population. In 1998, Quantock School closed. =Present Day= Following the death of David Peaster in 2000, the school reverted to its former name of Quantock Lodge, and was remarketed by Peaster's widow Jane as a centre for recreation and banqueting. It is also a youth summer camp centre.

The definition of \\"therapeutic\\" was not specific but was commonly understood to apply to cases in which the pregnant woman's life is endangered.United Nations Population Division. (2002). Abortion Policies: A Global Review. Retrieved 14 July 2006. The law prior to November 2006 held that anyone who performed an abortion upon a woman without her permission would be subject to a prison term of three to six years. If the woman consented, both she and the person who performed the abortion faced a sentence of one to four years, and if she attempted a self- induced abortion, the term of imprisonment was four to eight years. A person who performed, or attempted to perform, an abortion, and, as a result, caused injury to the pregnant woman would be jailed for four to 10 years, or six to 10 years if it caused her death. In October 2006, right before the general elections on 5 November 2006, the National Assembly passed a bill further restricting abortion 52-0 (9 abstaining, 29 absent). The European Union and the United Nations had urged for the vote to be delayed until after the presidential elections. The new law outlawed abortion in all circumstances, making Nicaragua the sixth country in the world to do so, after Chile, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Malta, and Vatican City. The Assembly rejected a proposal which would have increased the penalty for performing an illegal abortion from 10 to 30 years in prison. President Enrique Bola√±os supported this measure, but signed the bill into law on 17 November 2006. Pro- choice groups in Nicaragua have criticized the change to the country's abortion law, and one, the Women's Autonomous Movement, were prepared to file an injunction to prevent it from being enacted.\\"Nicaragua votes to ban abortions.\\" (26 October 2006).

The child's family, who were living in Costa Rica at the time, returned to Nicaragua after Costa Rican hospital officials had opposed their desire to end the girl's pregnancy. After the family successfully sought an abortion in a private clinic, the Health Minister of Nicaragua, Luc√≠a Salvo, declared that the procedure had constituted a criminal act, and officials threatened to press charges against those involved. However, Attorney General Mar√≠a del Carmen Sol√≥rzano stated that the abortion had not violated the law, as it had been performed in the interest of preserving the life of the girl. Rosa's case drew international attention and prompted intense debate about abortion law within Nicaragua. Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua said that the family and doctors involved in obtaining the abortion had excommunicated themselves from the Roman Catholic Church; bishops in Nicaragua also released an open letter which likened the termination of pregnancy to terrorist bombings. Others called for the country's laws to be liberalized.Miles, Nick. \\"Abortion ruling splits Nicaragua.\\" (4 March 2003). BBC News.

Human Rights Watch reports the deaths of at least eighty Nicaraguan women in the eleven months following the ban. To compile the report, interviews were conducted with health officials, women in need of health services, doctors in public health, doctors in the private healthcare system, and family members of women who died as a result of the ban. An unintended side effect has been a \\"chilling\\" of other forms of obstetrical care for women. The report states, \\"While no doctors have been prosecuted for the crime of abortion, as far as we know, the mere possibility of facing criminal charges for providing lifesaving health services has had a deadly effect... the Health Ministry does not monitor the full implementation of the protocols, does not systematize complaints received for the delay or denial of care, and so far has not studied the impact of the law on the lives and health of women.\\" The report quotes an obstetrician as saying \\"since the law was signed, [public hospitals] don‚Äôt treat any hemorrhaging, not even post-menopausal hemorrhaging.\\" Nicaragua‚Äôs Health Ministry officials told Human Rights Watch that they did not have any official documentation of the effects of the blanket ban and no plans for gathering such documentation. Consequently, statements that the ban has not caused women's deaths can not be substantiated. By contrast, the report cites several case histories.

Males are 3‚Äì6 mm long. =Habits= Nephilengys is the most synanthropic (found in and around human dwellings) of the nephiline genera. They build their webs against substrates such as tree trunks or walls. These can have a diameter of up to one meter. Nephilengys species incorporate a tubular retreat into their webs into which they will escape when disturbed. The retreat is always built against a hard surface; the web is built against a substrate, like those of Herennia and Clitaetra. While the orbs of young spiders are roughly symmetric, adults place the web hub very close to the top frame. While most orb web spiders rebuild a damaged web completely Nephilengys repairs damaged parts. Nephilengys are nocturnal spiders, spending most of the day in their retreat and nights at the hub. =Reproduction= The females are much larger than males, for example in N. malabariensis 20 mm versus 4 mm. Adult males do not build their own webs, but live with females, with sometimes several males found in the web of an adult or immature female. They accordingly lack silk glands producing sticky silk. Males often mate with a freshly moulted female, which cannot resist due to the softness of its cuticula. They often sever their mating organs, which are then found stuck in the female genital opening. Severed males may live on in their mate's web. Taxonomy The genus was erected in 1872 by Ludwig Koch. He placed four species in the genus, including the species then known as Epeira malabarensis, first described by Walckenaer in 1842. Koch described Nephilengys as very similar in the form of the cephalothorax, maxillae and labium to Nephila, but differing in the position of the eyes, and in leg lengths. The name Nephilengys refers to the close relationship with Nephila: Nephilengys = Nephila + Ancient Greek -engy-, \\"near to\\" or \\"close to\\". Koch placed Nephilengys in the family Araneidae. In 1894, Eug√®ne Simon erected the subfamily Nephilinae within the Araneidae for Nephila and related genera, including Nephilengys. This classification was used until the late 20th century, when cladistic studies initially suggested that nephilines belonged in the Tetragnathidae, although this was later refuted. In 2006, Matja≈æ Kuntner removed the nephilines from Araneidae and raised them to the family Nephilidae. Molecular phylogenetic studies from 2004 onwards consistently placed nephilids within Araneidae. Accordingly in 2016, Dimitar Dimitrov et al. returned the group to their traditional position as a subfamily of Araneidae. In 2013, based on phylogenetic studies, Matja≈æ Kuntner and co- workers split the original genus Nephilengys into two genera. Two species were left in Nephilengys, the remaining four being moved to the new genus Nephilingis. Nephilengys is differentiated from Nephilingis by the shapes of the female epigynum and the male palpal bulb. =Species= , the World Spider Catalog accepted the following species: * Nephilengys malabarensis (Walckenaer, 1842) ‚Äì India to China, Philippines, Japan, Ambon * Nephilengys papuana Thorell, 1881 ‚Äì New Guinea, Queensland Distribution Nephilengys species occur in tropical Asia, from India to Indonesia, and in Queensland, Australia. Predators and parasites N. malabarensis are preyed upon by the spider-eating jumping spider Portia. At least some species shake their bodies vigorously when touched.

The first is a rare type of old master print parts of which are decorated with small thin shiny fragments of metal or quartz crystal applied to glue. Gold leaf fragments were used on some, and colour was applied before the tinsel. Arthur Mayger Hind cites fewer than ten examples as being \\"practically all whose location is known... all seem to date between about 1430 and 1460\\". All are religious woodcuts, and probably German in origin,An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, pp171-2, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 ; Grove perhaps from Augsburg.Areford They intended to imitate fabric, which was also the intention of the related \\"flock prints\\", printed in glue on paper that had been impressed on fabrics, and then sprinkled with chopped wool.Grove; Areford The second type are popular prints, mainly British, produced in the early or mid-19th century, normally showing actors in their roles, though Napoleon I in his study was another subject. These were sold in plain or hand-coloured and tinselled versions, and the plain versions were often tinselled at home. Tin- foil tinsel in different colours, mostly in pre-stamped shapes, was applied with glue. The theatrical prints cost one penny plain, and two coloured, with a standard size of about 12 by 10 inches (250 x 200 mm). Actors, whether heros or villains, were more often represented than actresses. The artists are not named but the prolific political cartoonist and illustrator George Cruikshank is suspected of being involved.\\"Grove\\" Many prints also used fabric pieces and other additions (such as the plume of Mr Haines' helmet above). Prints with fabric are called \\"dressed prints\\"; this seems to have begun in 18th-century France as a hobby, mainly on devotional images. The same technique became popular for the smaller cut-out figures used in toy theatres, a craze of the period. A wide range of supplies for home-tinselling were available, or pre- tinselled figures could be bought.Rickards, 328 Tinsel printing can also refer to Indian techniques for fabric. Collections Though popular in their day, theatrical tinsel prints were often not valued, and can deteriorate if not well looked after. They are now rare, especially in good condition. There are collections in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London,with over 100, and plain versions the Cooper‚ÄìHewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York, and the Folger Shakespeare Library was given a collection of 53 examples in 2003.DeStefano, Rhea, \\"Rehousing our tinsel print collection\\", April 16, 2012, Folger Shakespeare Library File:Skelt, Martin and Matthew - theatrical tinsel portrait - Madame Vestris as Apollo - Google Art Project.jpgMadame Vestris as Apollo, English, 1837-40.

It was published on January 1, 1979 by Coward, McCann and Geoghegan. The book was adapted into a film by the same name in 1981, minus the novel's fifth protagonist character, Lewis Benedikt. The novel was a watershed in Straub's career. Though his earlier books had achieved a limited amount of critical and commercial success, Ghost Story became a national bestseller and cemented the author's reputation. Synopsis The story takes place in the fictional town of Milburn, New York, and is told from the alternating points of view of five men in their old age. The protagonists, lifelong friends who call themselves the \\"Chowder Society,\\" gather periodically to reminisce and share ghost stories. When one of them dies suddenly, the surviving men find themselves haunted by dreams in which they also die. As the story unfolds, their past is revealed to hold a murder from their youth, and they begin to fear that the young woman they killed has returned to take revenge upon them. Reception Stephen King, in his non-fiction review of the horror medium, Danse Macabre, lists Ghost Story as one of the finest horror novels of the late 20th century and provides a lengthy review within its \\"Horror Fiction\\" section. Relation to other Straub works Ricky Hawthorne is mentioned in the author's 1983 novel Floating Dragon, in which it is stated that he is the uncle of a victim in the latter book.

In some states they formed the core statewide network, but in the others they were either a few government branch lines, or privately owned and operated branch lines, often for mining, logging or industrial use. Prior to becoming an independent unified country in 1901, each of the six British colonies in Australia was responsible for rail transport infrastructure. Of the six colonies, only three (Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania) opted for narrow gauge railways. The other colonies (later states) opted for either standard-gauge or broad-gauge railways, maintaining only limited narrow-gauge rail lines, except for South Australia, which wavered between narrow and broad. As a result of this legacy, Australian railways are a confusing mix of all three gauges. Over time most of the mainland lines of whatever gauge linked up with inconvenient break-of-gauge stations where they met, including the infamous Albury railway station on the Albury‚ÄìWodonga line from Melbourne to Sydney, where the old cry of \\"Albury, all change!\\" has sunk into the national psyche. Some lines remained isolated because they were cut off by long stretches of desert. By state = Queensland = The massive narrow- gauge coal trains of the Queensland Railway with 100 wagons and 2 midtrain electric locomotives show what is possible with narrow gauge with modern equipment and tracklaying techniques. In 1865, the brief given to Queensland Railways was to build a semi-mountainous line in very sparsely populated territory, and it chose light rails, sharp curves, a small loading-gauge, light engines and rolling stock, 32 km/h speeds to make a limited budget go a long way. A clever salesman convinced the Queensland government that a narrow gauge would save money, and do the job for a hundred years. Queensland Railways was the first mainline narrow-gauge railway in the world. Its tracks would eventually extend to around 9000 km. In the intervening century, the rails have been replaced with heavier rails, there are now concrete sleepers and colour light signals, sharp curves have been straightened, tunnels have been opened out. The one thing that hasn't changed is the narrow gauge, even though the rest of the country is converting its main lines to the standard gauge . Queensland Rail also operates the iconic QR Tilt Train, with a recommended maximum speed of 165 km/h. This train currently holds the Australian Railway Speed Record of 210.7 km/h. Dual gauge has been added to give access from the interstate standard-gauge line to the Port of Brisbane. Dual gauge is also proposed to convert the standard-gauge interstate line for use by narrow-gauge commuter trains. Mossman in 1995 Queensland also has extensive sugar cane tramways of gauge. These cane tramways sometimes use second-hand standard-gauge shunting locomotives suitably regauged. The cane trams regularly haul over 500 tonnes of raw cane at a time, and because there are no continuous brakes, they may have a radio-controlled brake van coupled to the rear. To avoid speed restriction where some cane trams cross the main line, several of these crossings have been converted to drawbridges. = Tasmania = The first railway in the island state of Tasmania was broad gauge , but following the success of the narrow gauge in Queensland, a third rail was fitted, to allow conversion to narrow gauge. The state's rail network is now entirely narrow gauge. = South Australia = The first railways in this state were broad gauge including some lightweight horse-drawn lines. But following the success of the narrow gauge in Queensland, several narrow-gauge lines were started. Because of the geography of the state with deep gulfs of the ocean, the various narrow-gauge lines were isolated from each other to begin with. In the 1920s several narrow gauge lines were converted to broad gauge. The South Eastern narrow gauge lines were converted to broad gauge in the 1950s, with steel sleepers able to be converted to standard gauge at a later date if required. The privately owned iron ore mines at Iron Knob and Iron Baron are connected to the steel works at Whyalla by an isolated narrow- gauge line. = Western Australia = Inspired by the success of the narrow gauge in Queensland, Western Australia adopted the same gauge. In the capital of Perth, there was the only narrow-gauge tramway network (of any considerable extent) on mainland Australia. The final portion was closed in 1958. = Northern Territory = NSU class diesel locomotive as used on the Central Australia Railway The Northern Territory adopted narrow gauge when it was still part of South Australia, and a north‚Äìsouth transcontinental line was planned from Adelaide to Darwin in the 1870s. The Central Australia Railway was built northwards from 1878, reaching Alice Springs in 1929, and closed in 1980 when a parallel standard-gauge railway was built. The North Australia Railway was constructed southwards from Darwin to Birdum, opening in 1889 and closing in 1976. The 3000 km standard-gauge Adelaide‚ÄìDarwin railway opened in 2004. Because there are no tunnels or narrow bridges on the old narrow-gauge line, the line received a lot of second-hand standard-gauge rolling stock, this rolling stock being noticeably larger than the original narrow-gauge wagons and carriages. = New South Wales = The railways of New South Wales used standard gauge from the beginning. An exception was at Broken Hill where the large silver-lead mine is only 30 km from the South Australian border, but separated by hundreds of kilometres of desert from the main NSW standard-gauge railway system. As a result, in 1888 the Silverton Tramway was opened between the mines and the South Australian Railways system, the line lasting until gauge standardisation bypassed the line in 1970. = Victoria = The Puffing Billy railway Most railway lines in Victoria were built to the broad gauge. However four common carrier lines were built to the narrow gauge standard, to serve local farming and forestry communities. There was also widespread usage of narrow-gauge forestry railways and tramways. Sections of two lines (Belgrave to Gembrook and Thomson to Walhalla) have been restored as tourist railways. The Puffing Billy Railway is maintained and operated by volunteers as a steam-hauled preserved railway and tourist attraction. The last of the four narrow-gauge railways to open, the Moe to Walhalla line in Gippsland, which was opened in 1910 and then closed in 1954, has been partially reopened from Thomson Station into Walhalla in recent years as the Walhalla Goldfields Railway. Because the Puffing Billy Railway has nearly all of the remaining locomotives and rolling stock known to exist from the four NG lines, this line has had to modify rolling stock from elsewhere or build new, but non-original style, rolling stock. In addition to the main rail network of the Victorian Railways and successors, a number of narrow-gauge private railways and tramways have also existed for logging and mining purposes. These included the Yallourn 900mm Railway in the Latrobe Valley open cut coal mines, the Fyansford Cement Works Railway near Geelong, the Tyers Valley Tramway at Mount Baw Baw, and the Powelltown Tramway from Yarra Junction. Most logging tramways operated in the Otway Ranges, Gippsland, and the inner east of the Great Dividing Range; primarily between the 1850s and the 1950s, with only one surviving into the 1960s. They were primarily of or gauge, with , , , and variants also used.

Only one species is known from subtropical habitats. Galaxiids are the dominant group of native freshwater fish in New Zealand, and, along with the Percichthyidae, one of two dominant groups of native freshwater fish in southeastern Australia. Only one of the species (G. zebratus) is found in Africa, and only three (G. globiceps, G. maculatus, and G. platei) are found in South America. Habitat Galaxiids are coolwater species, with many wholly freshwater species specialising in high-altitude upland streams (including very small streams), rivers, and lakes. Some galaxiids include a marine stage in their lifecycles where larvae are washed out to sea to develop, and return to rivers as juveniles. This type of diadromous fish migration is known as amphidromy. These species are consequently also found in low-altitude habitats, but frequently migrate to high-altitude reaches of river systems in their adult stage. Threats Wholly freshwater galaxiids are gravely threatened by exotic salmonid species, particularly exotic trout species, which prey heavily upon them and compete with them for food and habitat. This is a major concern, as exotic trout species have been introduced to many different land masses (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, South Africa) with no thought as to impacts on native fish such as galaxiids, and no attempt to preserve some exotic trout-free habitats for native fish.Biodiversity, Alien trout, and the \\"So what\\" attitude In most situations, wholly freshwater galaxiids are unable to persist in the presence of exotic trout species, and many are now restricted to the few remaining trout-free habitats. Where these species are found in the presence of trout, the galaxiids usually consist entirely of individuals which dispersed there from an upstream trout-free population, and are not self-sustaining. Numerous localised extinctions of wholly freshwater galaxiid species (i.e. mountain galaxias) have been caused by the introduction of exotic trout species (including ongoing illegal stockings) and a number of wholly freshwater galaxiid species are threatened with extinction by exotic trout species and other exotic salmonids. Introduced salmoniids also have a negative impact on diadromous galaxiids, competing with them for food and habitat, as well as preying on them.

The construction preserves the property of being triangle-free but increases the chromatic number; by applying the construction repeatedly to a triangle- free starting graph, Mycielski showed that there exist triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number. Construction Mycielskian construction applied to a 5-cycle graph, producing the Gr√∂tzsch graph with 11 vertices and 20 edges, the smallest triangle-free 4-chromatic graph . Let the n vertices of the given graph G be v1, v2, . . . , vn. The Mycielski graph Œº(G) contains G itself as a subgraph, together with n+1 additional vertices: a vertex ui corresponding to each vertex vi of G, and an extra vertex w. Each vertex ui is connected by an edge to w, so that these vertices form a subgraph in the form of a star K1,n. In addition, for each edge vivj of G, the Mycielski graph includes two edges, uivj and viuj. Thus, if G has n vertices and m edges, Œº(G) has 2n+1 vertices and 3m+n edges. The only new triangles in Œº(G) are of the form vivjuk, where vivjvk is a triangle in G. Thus, if G is triangle-free, so is Œº(G). To see that the construction increases the chromatic number \\\\chi(G)=k, consider a proper k-coloring of \\\\mu(G){-}\\\\\\\\{w\\\\\\\\}; that is, a mapping c : \\\\\\\\{v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n,u_1,\\\\ldots,u_n\\\\\\\\}\\\\to \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,k\\\\\\\\} with c(x) eq c(y) for adjacent vertices x,y. If we had c(u_i)\\\\subset \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,k{-}1\\\\\\\\} for all i, then we could define a proper (k‚àí1)-coloring of G by c'\\\\\\\\!(v_i) = c(u_i) when c(v_i) = k, and c'\\\\\\\\!(v_i) = c(v_i) otherwise. But this is impossible for \\\\chi(G)=k, so c must use all k colors for \\\\\\\\{u_1,\\\\ldots,u_n\\\\\\\\}, and any proper coloring of the last vertex w must use an extra color. That is, \\\\chi(\\\\mu(G))=k{+}1. Iterated Mycielskians M2, M3 and M4 Mycielski graphs Applying the Mycielskian repeatedly, starting with the one-edge graph, produces a sequence of graphs Mi = Œº(Mi‚àí1), sometimes called the Mycielski graphs. The first few graphs in this sequence are the graph M2 = K2 with two vertices connected by an edge, the cycle graph M3 = C5, and the Gr√∂tzsch graph M4 with 11 vertices and 20 edges. In general, the graph Mi is triangle-free, (i‚àí1)-vertex-connected, and i-chromatic. The number of vertices in Mi for i ‚â• 2 is 3 √ó 2i‚àí2 ‚àí 1 , while the number of edges for i = 2, 3, . . . is: : 1, 5, 20, 71, 236, 755, 2360, 7271, 22196, 67355, ... . Properties Hamiltonian cycle in M4 (Gr√∂tzsch graph) *If G has chromatic number k, then Œº(G) has chromatic number k + 1 . *If G is triangle-free, then so is Œº(G) . *More generally, if G has clique number œâ(G), then Œº(G) has clique number max(2,œâ(G)).. *If G is a factor- critical graph, then so is Œº(G) . In particular, every graph Mi for i ‚â• 2 is factor-critical. *If G has a Hamiltonian cycle, then so does Œº(G) . *If G has domination number Œ≥(G), then Œº(G) has domination number Œ≥(G)+1. . Cones over graphs A generalized Mycielskian, formed as a cone over the 5-cycle, Œî3(C5) = Œî3(Œî2(K2)). A generalization of the Mycielskian, called a cone over a graph, was introduced by and further studied by and . In this construction, one forms a graph Œîi(G) from a given graph G by taking the tensor product of graphs G √ó H, where H is a path of length i with a self-loop at one end, and then collapsing into a single supervertex all of the vertices associated with the vertex of H at the non-loop end of the path. The Mycielskian itself can be formed in this way as Œº(G) = Œî2(G). While the cone construction does not always increase the chromatic number, proved that it does so when applied iteratively to K2. That is, define a sequence of families of graphs, called generalized Mycielskians, as : ‚Ñ≥(2) = {K2} and ‚Ñ≥(k+1) = {Œîi(G)  G ‚àà ‚Ñ≥(k), i ‚àà ‚Ñï}. For example, ‚Ñ≥(3) is the family of odd cycles. Then each graph in ‚Ñ≥(k) is k-chromatic. The proof uses methods of topological combinatorics developed by L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz to compute the chromatic number of Kneser graphs. The triangle- free property is then strengthened as follows: if one only applies the cone construction Œîi for i ‚â• r, then the resulting graph has odd girth at least 2r + 1, that is, it contains no odd cycles of length less than 2r + 1. Thus generalized Mycielskians provide a simple construction of graphs with high chromatic number and high odd girth.  References  *. *. *. *. *. *. As cited by . *.

Personal life  Kallidai was born in Tamil Nadu in India. From 1977 to 1982, Sri U.Ve NSS Rajan Iyengar, a Sri Vaishnava taught him the inner meanings and chanting procedures for various Hindu scriptures like the Vishu Sahasranamam, the Narayaniyam and other Vaishnava texts. He undertook panchasamskaram (also called Samashrayanam in the Sri Vaishnava order) from HH Srimushanam Andavan Srimad Rangaramanuja Mahadesikan of the Srirangam Andavan Ashramam, an orthodox lineage tracing back to Srimad Vedanta Desikan and Srimad Ramanujacharya. He was closely associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In 1990, he became the editor of Hare Krishna Today, a newsletter with a circulation of 25,000 people. In the early 90s, Kallidai left a job in Air India and migrated to the UK, where he worked for the Hinduja Group, before joining Fujitsu UK, the third largest IT service company in the world. He came out of Fujitsu in 2014 as its Global Sales Director for their India GDC.  Involvement in British Hindu organisations  After migrating to the UK, Kallidai immediately played an active role in the campaign to save Bhaktivedanta Manor for public worship. The temple had been threatened with closure by Hertesmere Borrough Council and had led to a campaign of unprecedented scale, uniting Hindus of all denominations in the UK. Kallidai was instrumental in 1994 to set up a youth group called Pandava Sena that had a major role to play in the Bhaktivedanta Manor Campaign. Since then he has been actively involved in serving the Hindu community in the UK. He served on the Executive Committees of various Hindu bodies in the UK including the National Council of Hindu Temples, the Hindu Council UK, Hindu Aid and the Hindu Forum of Britain.  Community agenda  Kallidai has advised the British Government on several public policy matters by drawing evidence from community consultation exercises on issues ranging from diversity, equality, discrimination and human rights to anti-terrorism and crime. = Community consultations on public policy = Kallidai conducted various consultation exercises, stakeholder workshops, surveys and other activities with the Hindu community, and some with the all the major faith communities in the UK.

Three men entered Asia House and damaged two paintings by spray-painting them, causing Asia House to cite security fears as the compelling reason for cancelling the exhibition. This led to a major controversy with many other groups citing a violation of freedom of speech, while many Hindu organisations felt that freedom of speech should not abused to cause so much hurt. May 2006, File Room from the Asia House The M F Hussain exhibition closure resulted in several academics raising the subject of extreme Hindu views being peddled in Britain, and with one even suggesting that there were two versions of 'Hindutva' in the UK, the 'soft' approach of Kallidai and the Hindu Forum of Britain, and the hard-line attempts of organisations such as the Hindu Human Rights, and the HSS. January 2015, Neo- Hindutvca, the Asia House MF Hussain Campaign, Routledge The Birmingham Post invited Kallidai to write a full-page story they published in 2007, titled 'The British way to a Hindu future' in which he pointed out that discrimination against Hindus was not addressed by the Government in the same successful manner as discrimination against Jews and Muslims. 2007, The British Way to a Hindu Future, Birmingham Post In January 2007, he led an international campaign to get German efforts to get the use of the Swastika banned across the European Union, terming the swastika as a 'symbol of peace for thousands of years before the Nazis adopted it' and claimed that the ban on the symbol would discriminate against Hindus. January 2007, Hindus Opposing Swastika Ban, BBC Europe Germany eventually gave up the idea of banning the symbol after an international media campaign that was reported widely in over 25 countries. At a conference he had organised to discuss security for Hindus in partnership with the Metropolitan Police in February 2007, Kallidai alleged that many Muslim men were targeting young Hindu girls for conversion. This generated controversy with several Muslim organisations refuting the allegations made in the presence of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner at that time, Sir Ian Blair. February 2007, Hindu girls targeted by Extremists, BBC South East This resulted in the Commissioner admitting at the conference that many Hindus felt neglected by the Police and the eventual setting up of a Hindu Safety Forum.

November 2007, Gordon Brown becomes a Hindu, Daily Star In 2007 an investigation in the Evening Standard called Kallidai \\"the fundamentalist father\\" and stated that many of his claims of Muslim men \\"forcibly\\" converting \\"hundreds\\" of Hindu girls were based on no evidence. It also cited his defense of more controversial organisations such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, cited by Human Rights Watch as being responsible for thousands of deaths in Gujarat, India, in 2003. In response the Hindu Forum of Britain clarified that the Evening Standard had not given them more than a few hours to respond despite requests for adequate time, and said that the statements in the Evening Standard were wrongly attributed to him without verifying the truth with them. The HFB said that, \\"While having meetings around the country, officers of the HFB have observed a high level of resentment from leaders of the Hindu communities about perceived aggressive conversion techniques. We have maintained that the resentment level is factual, and detrimental to community relations, but that we do not know the scope and extent of the problem.Therefore, during our discussions with the Police and others we have requested a formal study to understand the extent of the problem, and either bust myths to reassure the community if the problem is not real, or to deal with it if it is.

Founded October 24, 1991, the station is owned by Alpha & Omega Communications LLC.  History  On October 24, 1991, the FCC granted a construction permit to Hope Broadcasting Corporation to build a low-power television station on UHF channel 22 to serve the cities of Boise and Caldwell, Idaho. The FCC assigned the callsign K22DX to the station and following two extensions of the construction permit, the station was licensed on August 23, 1994 with a modification of the city of license to only specify Boise. The station took the call letters KCLP-LP in December 1997 and Alpha & Omega Communications LLC acquired the station in September 1999. Local PBS member station KAID received UHF channel 21 in the DTV Table of Allocations in April 1997 and began building the station in July 2000. Because the digital station was adjacent to KCLP-LP, Alpha & Omega applied to move their station to UHF channel 38 in September, and was granted the permit in April 2001, along with a permit to upgrade the license to Class A. The station was licensed as a Class A station on August 8, 2001. The following November, however, the FCC granted permission to KM Communications to change the specified channel of their new full-power construction permit from UHF channel 14 to UHF channel 39, adjacent to the new channel for KCLP-LP. KCLP-LP applied for a license to cover the move to channel 38 in July 2002, then canceled the application in November. Studies had determined that the new full-service station on channel 39, KKJB, would cause interference to 96% of the households served by the low-power station, now called KCLP-CA, on channel 38 . In January 2004, KCLP-CA applied to move to channel 18; the FCC granted the application in May. On March 31, 2006, KCLP-CA was licensed to operate on channel 18.

Reverence and respect for the land and oral traditions are emphasised. Language and other groupings exhibit a range of individual cultures. Australian Aboriginal art has existed for thousands of years and ranges from ancient rock art to modern watercolour landscapes. Aboriginal music has developed a number of unique instruments. Contemporary Australian Aboriginal music spans many genres. Aboriginal peoples did not develop a system of writing before colonisation, but there was a huge variety of languages, including sign languages. Oral tradition Cultural traditions and beliefs as well as historical tellings of actual events are passed down in Aboriginal oral tradition, also known loosely as oral history (although the latter has a more specific definition). Some of the stories are many thousands of years old. In a study published in February 2020, new evidence produced by using a form of radiometric dating showed that both Budj Bim and Tower Hill volcanoes erupted at least 34,000 years and up to 40,000 years ago. Significantly, this is a \\"minimum age constraint for human presence in Victoria\\", and also could be interpreted as evidence for the Gunditjmara oral histories which tell of volcanic eruptions being some of the oldest oral traditions in existence. An axe found underneath volcanic ash in 1947 was also proof that humans inhabited the region before the eruption of Tower Hill. Beliefs Aboriginal Australians' oral tradition and spiritual values build on reverence for the land and on a belief in the Dreamtime, or Dreaming. The Dreaming is considered to be both the ancient time of creation and the present-day reality of Dreaming. It describes the Aboriginal cosmology, and includes the ancestral stories about the supernatural creator- beings and how they created places. Each story can be called a \\"Dreaming\\", with the whole continent is criss-crossed by of Dreamings or ancestral tracks, also represented by songlines. There are many different groups, each with their own individual culture, belief structure and language. *The Rainbow Serpent is a major ancestral being for many Aboriginal people across Australia. *Baiame or Bunjil are regarded as the primary creator-spirits in South-East Australia. *Dingo Dreaming is a significant ancestor in the interior regions of Bandiyan, as Dingo formed the songlines that cross the continent from north to south and east to west.Andrews, M. (2000) 'The Seven Sisters', Spinifex Press, North Melbourne, p. 428 *The Yowie and Bunyip have their roots in Aboriginal mythology. =Sacred sites= Aboriginal people that some places are sacred, owing to their central place in the mythology of the local people. Customary law The words \\"law\\" and \\"lore\\" are commonly used interchangeably: \\"law\\" was introduced by the British, whereas \\"lore\\" relates to the customs and stories from the Dreamtime, which has been passed on through countless generations through songlines, stories and dance. Learned from childhood, lore dictates the rules on how to interact with the land, kinship and community. =Arnhem Land= The complete system of Yolngu customary law is the \\"Madayin\\", which embodies the rights and responsibilities of the owners of the law, or citizens (rom watangu walal, or simply rom). Madayin includes the rom, as well as the objects that symbolise the law, oral rules, names and song cycles, and the sacred places that are used to maintain, develop and provide education in the law. Rom can be roughly translated as \\"law\\" or \\"culture\\", but it embodies more than either of these words. Galarrwuy Yunupingu has described Rom watangu as the overarching law of the land, which is \\"lasting and alive... my backbone\\". It covers ownership of land and waters and the resources within this region; it controls production trade; and includes social, religious and ethical laws. These include laws for conservation and farming of flora and fauna. Observance of Madayin creates a state of balance, peace and true justice, known as Magaya. Rom includes bush crafts such as basket-weaving and mat-making, and stories which teach history, hunting, spear-making, gathering food, building shelters and rafts, various rituals, and taking care of others. \\"Rom\\" is a word and concept shared by at least one of the nearby peoples, the Anbarra, who also perform a Rom ceremony. Ceremonies and sacred objects Australian Aboriginal Ceremonies have been a part of Aboriginal culture since the beginning, and still play a vital part in society. They are held often, for many different reasons, all of which are based on the spiritual beliefs and cultural practices of the community. They include Dreaming stories, secret events at sacred sites, homecomings, births and deaths. They still play a very important part in the lives and culture of Aboriginal people. They are performed in Arnhem Land and Central Australia with the aim of ensuring a plentiful supply of foods; in many regions they play an important part in educating children, passing on the lore of their people, spiritual beliefs and survival skills; some ceremonies are a rite of passage for adolescents; other ceremonies are around marriage, death or burial. Most include dance, song, rituals and elaborate body decoration and/or costume. Ancient Aboriginal rock art shows ceremonies and traditions are still continued today. Ceremonies provide a time and place for everyone in the group and community to work together to ensure the ongoing survival of spiritual and cultural beliefs. Certain stories are individually \\"owned\\" by a group, and in some cases dances, body decoration and symbols in a ceremony pass on these stories only within the group, so it is vital that these ceremonies are remembered and performed correctly. Men and women have different roles, and are sometimes appointed as guardians of a sacred site, whose role it is to care for the site and the spiritual beings who live there, achieved partly by performing ceremonies. The terms ‚Äúmen‚Äôs business‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs business‚Äù are sometimes used; neither have greater spiritual needs or responsibilities than the other, but jointly ensure that sacred practices are passed on. Men often conduct ceremonies, but women are also guardians of special knowledge, hold great spiritual power within a group, and conduct ceremonies. Participation in ceremonies can also be restricted by age, family group, language group, but are sometimes open to all, depending on the purpose of the ceremony. Right of access to songs and dances pertaining to a specific ceremony belong to a certain defined group; some may be shared with people outside the community, but some are never shared. There is a wide range of songs, dances, music, body ornamentation, costume, and symbolism, designed to connect the body with the spiritual world of the ancestors. Ceremonies help to sustain Aboriginal identity as well as the group's connection to country and family. =Examples of ceremonies= *A bora is an initiation ceremony in which young boys (Kippas) become men. *The Bunya feast held in the hinterland of the Sunshine Coast of Queensland is well-known. Representatives from many different groups from across southern Queensland and northern New South Wales would meet to discuss important issues relating to the environment, social relationships, politics and Dreaming lore, feasting and sharing dance ceremonies. Many conflicts would be settled at this event, and consequences for breaches of laws were discussed. *Burial practices differ from group to group. In parts of Northern Australia, there are two stages of burial. After the body has been on an elevated platform, covered with leaves and branches, long enough for the flesh to rot away from the bones, the bones are collected, painted with ochre, and dispersed in various ways. *A corroboree is a ceremonial meeting for Australian Aboriginal people, interacting with the Dreaming and accompanied by song and dance. They differ from group to group, and may be sacred and private. *An ilma is both a public ceremony or performance of the Bardi people, and the hand-held objects used in these ceremonies. *The inma is a cultural ceremony of A·πâangu women of Central Australia, involving song and dance and embodying the stories and designs of the tjukurrpa (Ancestral Law, or Dreamtime). The ceremony carries camaraderie, joy, playfulness and seriousness, and may last for hours. There are many different inma, all profoundly significant to the culture. *A Pukamani, or Pukumani, is a burial ceremony of the Tiwi Islands, which lasts for several days around the grave of the deceased about six months after their death. Elaborate funerary posts known as tutini are erected around the grave before the ceremony, and dancers dance and sing around the posts. *The ROM (or Rom - see previous section) ceremony, involving songs, dances, and artefacts, which involve presenting other neighbouring communities with decorated totem poles, with the intent of establishing or re-establishing friendly terms with them; a form of diplomacy. The process of making and decorating the poles can extend over weeks, and involves successive sessions of song and dance, culminating in the ceremony where gifts are exchanged. In April 2017, a four-day festival to mark the Rom ceremony was attended by about 500 people at Gapuwiyak School, in north- eastern Arnhem Land. It was planned to hold the event each term. Historian and writer Billy Griffiths wrote in his award-winning book Deep Time Dreaming: Uncovering Ancient Australia (2018), of the Rom ceremony as an \\"extension of friendship\\" and \\"ritual of diplomacy\\", of which the \\"full significance ... has yet to be appreciated by the Australian public. At the heart of this symbolic act is a gift ‚Äì of song and dance and cultural knowledge, but it comes with obligations. The acceptance of such a gift enmeshes the recipients into a continual process of reciprocity\\". *A smoking ceremony is a cleansing ritual performed on special occasions. *Tjurunga (or churinga) are objects of religious significance by Central Australian Arrernte groups. *Walkabout is a rite of passage journey during adolescence, often mis-applied. *A welcome to country is a ritual now performed at many events held in Australia, intended to highlight the cultural significance of the surrounding area to a particular Aboriginal group. The welcome must be performed by a recognised elder of the group. The welcome ceremony is sometimes accompanied by a smoking ceremony, music or dance. =Musical instruments and other objects= The didgeridoo originated in northern Australia, but is now used throughout the continent. Clapsticks, seed rattles and objects such as rocks or pieces of wood are used; in a few areas, women play a drum made from goanna, snake, kangaroo or emu skin. Healing Traditional healers (known as Ngangkari in the Western desert areas of Central Australia) are highly respected men and women who not only acted as healers or doctors, but also generally served as custodians of important Dreaming stories.Traditional Healers of Central Australia: Ngangkari. Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Women's Council Aboriginal Corporation. 2013. Magabala Books, Broome, WA, pp. 15-19. Cultural burning Cultural burning, identified by Australian archaeologist Rhys Jones in 1969, is the practice of regularly and systematically burning patches of vegetation used in Central to Northern Australia to facilitate hunting, to reduce the frequency of major bush-fires, and to change the composition of plant and animal species in an area. This \\"fire-stick farming\\", or \\"burning off\\", reduces the fuel-load for a potential major bush fire, while fertilising the ground and increasing the number of young plants, providing additional food for kangaroos and other fauna hunted for meat. It is regarded as good husbandry and \\"looking after the land\\" by Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.Kakadu Man, by Big Bill Neidjie, Stephen Davis, and Allan Fox, 1986, Music A didgeridoo, or yidaki Aboriginal people have developed unique musical instruments and folk styles. The didgeridoo is often considered the national instrument of Aboriginal Australians; however, it was traditionally played by peoples of Northern Australia, and only by the men. It has possibly been used by the people of the Kakadu region for 1500 years. Clapping sticks are probably the more ubiquitous musical instrument, especially because they help maintain rhythm. More recently, Aboriginal musicians have branched into rock and roll, hip hop and reggae. Bands such as No Fixed Address and Yothu Yindi were two of the earliest Aboriginal bands to gain a popular following among Australians of all cultures. In 1997 the State and Federal Governments set up the Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts (ACPA) to preserve and nurture Aboriginal music and talent across all styles and genres from traditional to contemporary. Art and crafts Australian Aboriginal art has a history spanning thousands of years. Aboriginal artists continue these traditions using both modern and traditional materials in their artworks. Aboriginal art is the most internationally recognizable form of Australian art. Several styles of Aboriginal art have developed in modern times including the watercolour paintings of Albert Namatjira, the Hermannsburg School, and the acrylic Papunya Tula \\"dot art\\" movement. Painting is a large source of income for some Central Australian communities such as at Yuendumu. Basket weaving has been traditionally practised by the women of many Aboriginal peoples across the continent for centuries. Astronomy A depiction of the Emu in the sky, which is an Australian Aboriginal constellation consisting of dark clouds rather than stars. The time of year in which the Emu in the sky stands upright in the evening marks the time when emu eggs are ready to be collected. For many Aboriginal cultures, the night sky is a repository of stories and law. Songlines can be traced through the sky and the land. Stories and songs associated with the sky under many cultural tents. Traditional recreation An Indigenous community Australian rules football game The Djabwurrung and Jardwadjali people of western Victoria once participated in the traditional game of Marn Grook, a type of football played with possum hide. The game is believed by some commentators, including Martin Flanagan,Martin Flanagan, The Call. St. Leonards, Allen & Unwin, 1998, p. 8 Martin Flanagan, 'Sport and Culture' Jim Poulter and Col Hutchinson, to have inspired Tom Wills, inventor of the code of Australian rules football. Similarity between Marn Grook and Australian football include jumping to catch the ball or high \\"marking\\", which results in a free kick. Use of the word \\"mark\\" in the game may be influenced by the Marn Grook word mumarki, meaning \\"catch\\". However, this is likely a false etymology; the term \\"mark\\" is traditionally used in Rugby and other games that predate AFL to describe a free kick resulting from a catch, in reference to the player making a mark on the ground from which to take a free kick, rather than continuing to play on. There are many Indigenous AFL players at professional level, with approximately one in ten players being of Indigenous origin . The contribution of the Aboriginal people to the game is recognized by the annual AFL \\"Dreamtime at the 'G\\" match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground between Essendon and Richmond football clubs (the colors of the two clubs combine to form the colours of the Aboriginal flag). . Testifying to this abundance of Indigenous talent, the Aboriginal All-Stars, an AFL-level all-Aboriginal football side competes against any one of the Australian Football League's current football teams in pre-season tests. The Clontarf Foundation and football academy is just one organisation aimed at further developing aboriginal football talent. The Tiwi Bombers began playing in the Northern Territory Football League and became the first all-Aboriginal side to compete in a major Australian competition. A popular children's game in some parts of Australia is weet weet, or throwing the play stick. The winner throws the weet weet furthest or the most accurately.'''

Shoeless Joe's is a sports-themed restaurant chain located in Ontario, Canada. The chain was founded in Toronto, ON in 1985. They specialize in chicken wings, but have a wide range of items on their menu. They are also known for their large complex of sports entertainment channels. The name is a reference to a former Major League Baseball player named Shoeless Joe Jackson. Stores The original location was on Eglinton Avenue in Toronto, Ontario as a local community sports bar. Investor Fred Lopreiato purchased it within several years, and the first franchised location opened in 1991. From 2011 until 2014, the franchise changed its image from that of a local sports bar to a \\"premium sports grill aesthetic.\\" By 2014, there were over 34 locations in Ontario in locations such as Courtney Park, Mississauga, with most franchised. Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill reopened after renovation and a change in ownership on December 12, 2016, located in the Whitby Entertainment Centrum in Durham. Also in July 2016, it was reported that the developer Stonebridge was planning to open a Shoeless Joe's restaurant in Peterborough, Canada. The two former restaurants in the city had closed, with a new building 4,560-square- foot large planned. In July 2016, the first location of the chain was opened outside Ontario, in Stonebridge, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

The center is being built inside the mostly unoccupied Mall At The Source, which was named for its former anchor store Fortunoff (which used the phrase \\"The Source\\" in advertising), which the mall was built around and which closed in June 2009. With the closure of Fortunoff, Steve and Barry's (which closed in early 2009), and Circuit City (which closed in March 2009), three large anchor stores have become vacant. The drop of foot traffic by the loss of the anchors has caused other stores ‚Äì the three aforementioned subanchor chains, plus Saks Off 5th, & Forever 21 ‚Äì and the entire food court ‚Äì including McDonald's, Starbucks, Ranch 1 ‚Äì to pull out from the mall. Simon Property Group and unnamed co-owners of the Mall at the Source defaulted on a $124 million balloon interest-only mortgage in March 2009. It was purchased by a European pension fund in August 2012 and auctioned. In November 2016, it was announced that the Mall at the Source will be sold and could be demolished to make way for a new mixed use development. In May 2017, Lesso Mall Development Long Island Inc. (a subsidiary of the Hong Kong listed LESSO Group) purchased the mall for $92 million. On October 21, 2017, it was announced that the Mall At The Source would be redeveloped into a decoration hub for Lesso Home, which was originally scheduled to open in the fall of 2018, but has been delayed. A few retailers, The Cheesecake Factory, P. F. Chang's China Bistro, Dave & Buster's, and a Fortunoff outdoor furniture and jewelry store will remain open during renovations. History =Proposal and construction (1964‚Äì1997)= The site of The Mall at the Source was originally Roosevelt Field airport, with Charles Lindbergh taking off on his epic trans-Atlantic flight near the site of the mall's parking garage. Roosevelt Raceway bought the property when it expanded the harness-racing track in the 1940s for additional parking. In the early 1960s, Ohrbach's constructed a department store on leased land at north-east corner of the raceway's property. Fortunoff built its store several years later in 1964, as they followed their customers east from the original Fortunoff location in Brooklyn. Alan Fortunoff bought the entire property north of the current boundary of Transverse Drive from Roosevelt Raceway in the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, Alan Fortunoff planned to construct the Long Island Galleria shopping mall, one comparable to the size of the massive Roosevelt Field Mall a few miles away but with different stores. It was to be built by the Westfield Group and include Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom as anchor stores. Community pressure over congestion concerns forced Fortunoff to scale back the size and scope of the mall. Roughly half of the property was sold to Price Club (now Costco), which developed their portion to include a Kmart (now Walmart). The mall was instead built by Simon Property Group, and they continued to manage and co-own the mall until August 2012. =The Mall At The Source (1997‚Äì2017)= The mall was also the first on Long Island to house clothing chains H&M;, Old Navy, Nordstrom Rack, and Saks Off 5th. It was also the first to house restaurants including The Cheesecake Factory, Dave & Buster's, P.F. Chang's China Bistro, and Rainforest Cafe (closed on October 19, 2000). The Mall at The Source is also adjacent to many other shopping complexes and restaurants. Many of the mall's tenants left after the closure of the anchor stores. 2009 saw the shuttering of all three anchor stores ‚Äî Fortunoff, Steve & Barry's, and Circuit City ‚Äî crippling foot traffic and resulting in a steady abandonment by its remaining tenants (outside of its restaurants, which maintained their standalone customers). On August 9, 2012, it was announced that the property was to go up for auction by the end of the month; by then, the mall was under 50% occupancy. The opening of the nearby Gallery at Westbury Plaza in late 2012 prompted Nordstrom Rack, Old Navy, and Saks Off 5th to move away, leaving the future of the mall uncertain. On August 28, an auction was held, but was unsuccessful in attracting buyers. Lenders then took ownership of the mall, and Newmark Grubb Knight Frank was hired for management. In 2013, a Lord & Taylor outlet store and the Jewelry Emporium and Mall opened in the former Nordstrom Rack and Off 5th, respectively. However, these stores failed to increase foot traffic at the mall, and the vacancy rate continued to increase. In 2014, Dick's Sporting Goods closed a substantial portion of its Golf Galaxy stores, including its store in the Mall at the Source. David's Bridal moved to the nearby Roosevelt Raceway Shopping Center in June 2015, leaving the Fortunoff court almost completely vacant. =Lesso Home New York Market (2018‚Äìpresent)= In May 2017, Lesso Mall Development Long Island Inc. (a subsidiary of the Hong Kong listed LESSO Group) purchased the mall for $92 million. On October 21, 2017, it was announced that the Mall At The Source would be redeveloped into a Decor Hub for Lesso Home; redevelopment had been originally scheduled to be completed by the fall of 2018, but has since been delayed. It will include showrooms for many manufactures for home furnishings, decor, walkable markets, etc. The format will be much similar to the Italy-based Eataly. Former layout The Off 5th Saks Court. The Mall at the Source had two floors and is shaped like an L. Because of this, the mall had separate \\"courts\\", named after the stores that anchor it (except for Center Court). Each anchor store had its own public entrance but not all have mall entrances; these stores tend to stay open later than the interior stores. =Center Court= The Center Court is the main entrance and includes a carousel and train. Some of the stores in the Center Court include, P. F. Chang's China Bistro and the former Lord & Taylor Outlet. The center court is also where the former Steve and Barry's was; in its place is a Fortunoff Backyard Store. Nordstrom Rack, Old Navy, and Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th relocated to the neighboring Gallery at Westbury Plaza. The carousel has since been removed. =Off 5th Saks Court= The Off 5th Saks court is the upper tip of the L, a long hall that includes the Food Court and the former Saks Off 5th. The 1st floor has a Dave & Buster's, the only tenant left in the court. It also contained the former Circuit City. =Fortunoff Court= Like the Off 5th Saks Court, the Fortunoff Court is a long hall, ending with the former Fortunoff. It also has the 2nd floor entrance to the former Ayhan's Shish Kebab and The Cheesecake Factory. The court also used to contain Gymboree Play & Music, Famous Footwear, Golf Galaxy, and Men's Wearhouse & Tux.

The station was one of the first commercial FM radio stations in the United States to exclusively feature Christian programming. Today the station programs contemporary Christian music. Owned by Crawford Broadcasting Company, WDJC-FM's transmitter tower is in Southwest Birmingham, and its studios are located in Homewood. History =WSGN-FM= The initial occupant of the 93.7 frequency in Birmingham was WSGN-FM. The station signed on in 1947; it was originally owned by the parent company of The Birmingham News, and it was the sister station of one of the more popular AM radio stations in Birmingham. In 1953, the parent company of The News purchased WAFM-TV, WAPI and WAFM-FM and was forced to sell WSGN-AM and FM to Jemison Broadcasting Company and then to Winston-Salem Broadcasting Company. Because FM radio was in its infancy, and as such neither popular nor profitable, the station was shut down in 1955. =WSFM= On a new license, James Melonas built a new station at 93.7 FM in 1958. This station bore the call letters WSFM and featured a classical music format. In 1967, Melonas, who struggled through most of his ownership to get advertisers to sponsor classical music programming, sold the frequency to Crawford Broadcasting Company. With its new call letters, WDJC, the station changed formats and began broadcasting Christian programming. Initially, the programming consisted of Bible studies, church services and other Christian teaching; by the mid-1970s, some contemporary Christian music was added to the programming mix (it is believed that only Huntsville's now-defunct WNDA‚Äînow WRTT-FM‚Äîwas the only other station in the state to do so at the time). At about the same time, a nightly program featuring Southern gospel music, the Dixie Gospel Caravan, was added. This programming strategy continued well into the 1990s. After an AM sister station was named WDJC, this station was assigned the WDJC-FM call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on December 4, 1978. On December 1, 1981, the station resumed its former WDJC call letters. The station was reassigned the current WDJC-FM call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on June 3, 1994. In 1998, WDJC-FM dropped the non- music elements of its programming. WFMH-FM in Cullman was purchased by a group of Birmingham investors with the purpose of launching a station that would play contemporary Christian music 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Initially, the new station, rebranded as WRRS-FM proved to be a challenger to WDJC-FM; in reaction to the challenge, WDJC-FM began to play contemporary Christian music exclusively. Within three years, WRRS changed formats; ironically, Crawford Broadcasting bought the competing station in 2003 and changed its format to talk radio.

By the 1830s the company had offices in Glasgow, Liverpool and Montreal. All five of Captain Allan's sons were actively involved with the business, but it was his second son, Sir Hugh Allan, who spearheaded the second generation. In 1854, Hugh launched the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company as part of the Allan Line, and two years later ousted Samuel Cunard to take control of the Royal Mail contract between Britain and North America. By the 1880s, the Allan Line was the world's largest privately owned shipping concern. In 1891, the company took over the State Line (founded 1872) and was often referred to as the Allan & State Line. In 1897, Andrew Allan amalgamated the various branches of the Allan shipping empire under one company, Allan Line Steamship Company Ltd., of Glasgow. The company by then had added offices in Boston and London. In 1917, under Sir Montagu Allan, who represented the third generation of the Allan family, the company was purchased by Canadian Pacific Steamships, and by the following year the Allan name had disappeared from commercial shipping. Media The 1970s British television series The Onedin Line (1971-1980) is a complex and veiled take on the Allan Line Family and their steamships. The Allan Line steamship SS Sardinian Notable collisions In 1891, the Allan Line steamer Carthaginian collided with the York River Line steamer Charlotte in the shipping channel at Baltimore, Maryland. Among those aboard the Carthaginian was the Danish-American composer Asger Hamerik. While both boats were damaged, neither sank. In 1905, the Allan Line steamer Parisian was involved in a collision with the Albano off of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The owners of the Albano were found by the Exchequer Court of Canada to be fully at fault, according to Reports of Cases Relating to Maritime Law.

He also held various government positions in the newly founded state of New Jersey during the early 1800s. The New Jersey Journal, which became the third newspaper published in New Jersey, was established by Kollock at his press during 1779 in the colonial village of Chatham, New Jersey, which had been settled in 1710 within the British Province of New Jersey. The newspaper, which later was renamed the Elizabeth Daily Journal, was a driving force in galvanizing support and disseminating information about the Revolutionary War efforts. His newspaper continued to be published for 212 years following its original publication, until January 3, 1992. History =Personal= Shepard Kollock Jr., who was the son of Mary Goddard and Shepard Kollock, was born September 1750 in Lewes, Sussex County, Delaware, and died July 28, 1839 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He married Susan Arnett on June 5, 1777, daughter of Hannah White and Isaac Arnett. Shepard and Susan had twelve children. He is buried in the First Presbyterian Church of Elizabeth. =Professional= He went to Philadelphia to learn the printing trade from William Goddard, editor of the Pennsylvania Chronicle. He remained in Philadelphia until he was twenty. Because of failing health, he then went to Saint Christopher in the West Indies, where he carried on the business of printing. When he heard of the revolutionary Battle of Lexington, he returned to the colony of New Jersey. He received a commission as Second Lieutenant in the Flying Camp in New Jersey, and in January 1777, was made First Lieutenant in the company of Colonel Niell of the Continental Artillery Regiment. He was at the battles of Trenton, Fort Lee, Short Hills, and other engagements. He resigned his commission in 1779 and, at the insistence of the Continental Congress, established the New Jersey Journal, in the village of Chatham. The New Jersey Journal became the third newspaper that started publication in New Jersey. His New Jersey Journal became a catalyst in the revolution. News of events came directly to the editor from the headquarters of George Washington in nearby Morristown. His publication boosted the morale of the troops and their families. He also conducted lively debates about the efforts for independence with both those who opposed and those who supported the cause he championed. During the evacuation of New York in 1783, he moved his press to that city and established the New York Gazetteer, published first weekly and then three times a week. He also founded a paper in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In 1787, he relocated and established his last publication location in Elizabethtown and adopted the name of the new location into his original newspaper title. He remained its owner and editor until 1818, when he sold his printing establishment. The Elizabeth Daily Journal, which had advocated for presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe while Kollock was its owner and editor, ceased publication on Friday, January 3, 1992. This was 212 years after its original start. At that time it was the fourth oldest newspaper published continuously in what now is the United States and the oldest newspaper published in New Jersey.Staff. \\"New Jersey Loses Oldest Paper\\", The Palm Beach Post, January 3, 1992.

At different times, he held all of the more important governmental offices in Elizabethtown, including alderman. He was appointed aide-de-camp for New Jersey Governor Joseph Bloomfield, and was re-appointed by his successor Aaron Ogden. After he sold his printing establishment, under President Monroe, he was appointed as Postmaster of Elizabethtown, which office he held until his retirement in 1829. He was one of the original members of the Society of the Cincinnati, the New Jersey Society that was formed in 1783. Kollock published several books in Chatham: *The United States Almanack, for the Year of our Lord 1780 in 1779 *The New-England Primer Improved, for the more easy attaining the true Reading of English, To which is added, the Assembly of Divines, and Mr. Cotton's Catechism in 1782 *Ebenezer Elmer, Surgeon of the Regiment, An e[u]logy on the late Francis Barber, Esq: Lieutenant Colonel Commandant of the Second New-Jersey Regiment in 1783 Today, Shepard Kollock Park, a recreational field named after him, exists in Chatham, New Jersey.

Early life The Honourable Bridget Hore-Ruthven was born in 1896, the eldest of the four daughters of Major-General Walter Hore-Ruthven, 10th Lord Ruthven of Freeland and the former Jean Lampson. Among her sisters were Hon. Jean Elisabeth St Loe Hore- Ruthven (wife of Don Francisco Larios, only son of Don Ernesto Larios) and Hon. Alison Mary Hore-Ruthven (wife of Cdr Sir John Leighton Barran, 3rd Baronet) and Hon. Margaret Leslie Hore-Ruthven (wife of Peter Llewelyn Davies). Her paternal grandparents were Walter James Hore-Ruthven, 9th Lord Ruthven of Freeland and Lady Caroline Annesley Gore (a daughter of Philip Gore, 4th Earl of Arran). Her maternal grandfather was Norman George Lampson, DL, JP, younger son of Sir Curtis Lampson, 1st Baronet. Bridget was therefore the niece both of Miles Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn, and of Alexander Hore- Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie. Career At the beginning of the Second World War, Lady Carlisle was a Senior Controller of the Auxiliary Territorial Service. The Countess of Carlisle was then promoted to become the Director of the Women's Auxiliary Corps (India) - the Indian counterpart of the ATS - and of the Women's Royal Indian Naval Service (WRINS). For her work in command, she was appointed a CBE (military division) in 1947. From 1962 to 1874, Lady Monckton was the Chairman of the charity Attend: the National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends. From 1977 to 1978, she returned to office at the charity when elected to be the President of Attend. =Peerage= Her father's title dated back to 1651 and was in the peerage of Scotland, hence the form: the Lord Ruthven, rather than Baron Ruthven, which meant that, unlike most English, Irish, British and UK titles, it could be inherited, as a matter of course, by a daughter. Therefore, upon the death of her father in 1956, Lady Monckton inherited the lordship of Ruthven of Freeland. She was now, suo jure, the Lady Ruthven of Freeland. In 1957, her husband received a peerage too, when he was created the first Viscount Monckton of Brenchley. Lady Ruthven of Freeland's marital title was now: the Viscountess Monckton of Brenchley. Although entitled to a Scottish peerage, Bridget was not initially entitled to membership of the legislature. However, from 1963 she did take her seat in the House of Lords, after the new Peerage Act 1963 gave all Scottish peers and all female holders of hereditary peerages the right to sit in the upper chamber of parliament.Bridget Helen Hore-Ruthven, Lady Ruthven of Freeland profile, thepeerage.com; accessed 2 April 2016. Unusually, she sat concurrently with her son and with her second husband, plus her cousins mentioned above. Personal life On 17 January 1918 she married George Howard, 11th Earl of Carlisle, becoming the Countess of Carlisle. They had two children: * Lady Carolyn Bridget Dacre Howard (b. 1919). * Charles James Ruthven Howard (1923‚Äì1994), styled Viscount Howard of Morpeth, until he became the 12th Earl of Carlisle in 1963. In 1947, Lord and Lady Carlisle divorced. Lady Carlisle then married Sir Walter Monckton on 13 August 1947, becoming Lady Monckton. Sir Walter was previously married to Mary Adelaide Somes Colyer-Fergusson (the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Colyer-Fergusson, 3rd Baronet). The couple had no children together, but both had offspring from their previous marriages. Lady Monckton of Brenchley died in April 1982, aged 85, and was succeeded in her own title by her son, who was already the Earl of Carlisle.

His father, Makhdoom Muhammmad Zaman was the 17th spiritual leader of Sarwari Jammat and as well a powerful feudal figure in the province. His father was one of the prominent 67 participants who laid the foundation of the Pakistan Peoples Party where he was made the senior vice-chairman of the party and PPP was found at his house in Hala, Sindh. Makhdoom Muhammad Zaman 'Talib ul Mola' successfully contested in the 1970 general elections and stepped into the national parliament as a member of parliament (MP). Makhdoom Muhammad Zaman was also offered many high-ranking posts in the time of General Muhammad Zia- ul-Haq, but he refused and chose to stay in Hala and look after his Sarwari Jamaat. =Education and early career= Amin Fahim completed his primary education in 1955 from Hala and did matriculation from a local high school in his native town Hala, in 1957.

In 1993 he contested as MPA and MNA, and was the only Parliamentarian in Pakistan to win both seats unopposed. After that he gave up the MPA seat to his younger brother and he even came unopposed on it . Makhdoom was offered the post of Prime Minister in 2002 by then President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, keeping in mind his party's leader Benazir Bhutto's refusal to appoint Mr. Amin Fahim's son Makhdoom Jameel Zaman as the Chief Minister Sindh, though he was offered the post of Prime Minister thrice before 1988‚Äì1990 and 1993. He remained loyal to his party and did not accept offers from then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the military dictators.

It was recorded that Sarwari Jamaat consisted of 900,000 people, 300 years ago and was titled as the 'No Lakhi Gadi' which means the Gaddi of 900,000 disciples. He was once married to Dina, elder sister of famous Bangladeshi Singer Runa Laila who later died due to cancer. Faheem died on 21 November 2015 from leukemia after being admitted to a hospital in Karachi, Pakistan under ICU at the age of 76.Senior PPP leader Makhdoom Amin Fahim dies Career after Benazir Bhutto assassination Makhdoom Amin Fahim was mentioned as a possible chairman for the PPP, in the wake of the 27 December 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto,David Rohde, \\"Musharraf‚Äôs Political Future Appears Troubled\\", The New York Times, 28 December 2007. but Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari were named party co-chairs and he was considered the party's probable candidate for Prime Minister.\\"Revenge mission that will have to wait\\" The Times 31 December 2007 However, the PPP hesitated to name Mr. Makhdoom as its candidate following its victory in the February 2008 election. It was suggested that Benazir Bhutto's widower Asif Ali Zardari, might be reluctant to nominate Makhdoom Amin Fahim as Prime Minister, because he was worried that Faheem could strengthen his political base in Sindh and threaten the influence of the Bhutto family there.Jo Johnson, \\"Party fails to name PM candidate\\", Financial Times, 7 March 2008. On 15 March 2008, Makhdoom Amin Fahim said that he did not understand why the PPP had still not named him as its candidate. According to Faheem, if Zardari wanted to take the position for himself, he would support him.\\"Pakistan: Bhutto party says PM candidate to be named next week\\", Associated Press International Herald Tribune, 15 March 2008. Later, the PPP nominated Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister on 22 March 2008. Although this was viewed as a snub to Mr. Amin Fahim, he said that he would not leave the PPP and had the \\"best wishes\\" for Gilani.\\"Bhutto's party names Pakistani PM candidate\\" Associated Press (MSNBC), 22 March 2008. Amin Fahim, however, was made the Commerce Minister of Pakistan in November 2008 shuffle as a consolation. Poetry Initially, Makhdoom Amin Fahim was more interested in poetry than politics. However, he had no choice but to jump into the fray as the political heir of Makhdoom family. He once said, ‚Äò‚ÄôPoetry is my first love. I am still fond of saying verses and reading poetry of others. His forte is mystic poetry. His poetry speaks about love, Peace, and simplicity.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have always been fond of the poetry of Maulana Rumi, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, and Sachal Sarmast. Their poetry has left a deep impact on my life. I have learned from them (Poets) to be loyal, to be loved, in good or rainy days.‚Äù He further said, ‚ÄúI don't believe in ruling the people. I believe in ruling their hearts.
