Preece relied on experiments and physical reasoning in his life's work. Upon his retirement from the Post Office in 1899, Preece was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1899 Birthday Honours. Biography Preece was born in Caernarfon (Gwynedd), Wales. He was educated at King's College School and King's College London. Preece studied at the Royal Institution in London (Great Britain) under Michael Faraday. He later was the consulting engineer for the Post Office (1870s). He became Engineer-in-Chief of the British General Post Office in 1892. He developed several improvements in railroad signalling system that increased railway safety. Preece and Oliver Lodge maintained a correspondence during this period. Upon Lodge's proposal of \\"loading coils\\" applied to submerged cables, Preece did not realise that \\"Earthing\\" would extend the distance and efficiency. Telegraphy In 1889 Preece assembled a group of men at Coniston Water in the Lake District in Lancashire and succeeded in transmitting and receiving Morse radio signals over a distance of about 1 mile (1.6 km) across water.South African Military History Society ‚Äì Journal ‚Äì WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY DURING THE ANGLO-BOER WAR OF 1899‚Äì1902 at rapidttp.co.za Preece also developed a wireless telegraphy and telephony system in 1892. Preece developed a telephone system and implemented it in England. A similar telephone system was patented in the United States by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. In 1885, Preece and Arthur West Heaviside (Oliver Heaviside's brother) experimented with parallel telegraph lines and an unwired telephone receiver, discovering radio induction (later identified with the effects of crosstalk). Preece blocked publication of some of Arthur and Oliver Heaviside's work. There was a long history of animosity between Preece and Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside considered Preece to be mathematically incompetent, an assessment supported by the biographer Paul J. Nahin: \\"Preece was a powerful government official, enormously ambitious, and in some remarkable ways, an utter blockhead.\\" Preece's motivations in suppressing Heaviside's work were more to do with protecting Preece's own reputation and avoiding having to admit error than any perceived faults in Heaviside's work. Radio In 1897, with Marconi radio experiments from Lavernock Point in south Wales to the island of Flatholm, Preece became one of Marconi's most ardent supporters. He made various efforts to support Guglielmo Marconi in the wireless field. Preece gained financial assistance from the Post Office to help expand Marconi's work. Preece believed that the Earth's magnetic field was critical in the propagation of radio waves over long distances. He had a long-standing rivalry with Oliver Heaviside over his understanding of electricity. It was derisively referred to as \\"the drain-pipe theory\\" by Heaviside, because Preece relied on an analogy between electricity and water for thought experiments. Reportedly, he rejected and never understood James Clerk Maxwell's advances to mathematical physics, and insisted that adding inductance to a telegraph line could only be detrimental, even while Maxwell's and Heaviside's theory and experiments showed that inductance could help. Preece once stated, conveying sentiments later expressed by Edwin Armstrong, Preece served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers between April 1898 and November 1899.

Early life Five fishermen sitting by their nets on a beach, with a young boy, Peter Tait. Tait was born on 5 September 1915, in Wellington's Island Bay suburb. His family were Scottish immigrants, originally from the Shetland Islands. His father Jack and his uncles Peter and Ross belonged to the best known Shetland fishing families in Island Bay. Through his early life, Tait suffered from tuberculosis, which meant that he was unable to play an active role in New Zealand's Second World War effort, nor could he become a Baptist minister. He moved from Waipukurau, a rural community, to the East Coast of the North Island, and ultimately settled in Napier. Once established there, he opened a shoe store, which came to have branches in Waipukurau, Napier, Hastings and Dannevirke. Political career =Member of Parliament= Tait served as the National Member of Parliament for Napier (1951‚Äì1954). =Mayor of Napier= Two years after leaving Parliament, he became Mayor of Napier for the next eighteen years (1956‚Äì1974). Later life and death Tait was a Baptist, who helped to organise the Coalition of Concerned Citizens in the mid-eighties, and fought against homosexual law reform. Ultimately, though, the Homosexual Law Reform Act passed its final reading. Tait then ran foul of his former colleagues in the 'Gang of Twenty' affair in 1989 when the contributory mortgage company he chaired, AdvisorCorp, found itself the target of attacks from National Party leader Jim Bolger. Bolger would later publicly apologise to Tait, but two of the principals in the company were successfully prosecuted and AdvisorCorp collapsed. He funded the Tait Fountain in Napier, which commemorates Victory in Europe Day and was dedicated on 9 May 1995 on the 50th anniversary of the end of that war.

Life He was born on 14 February 1850 at Garvagh, County Londonderry, the second son of Samuel Perry and a Scottish- born wife. John's brother James was the County Surveyor in Galway West and co- founded the Galway Electric Light Company; and one of James's daughters was Alice Perry, the first Irish woman with an engineering degree (and one of the first in the world). Perry worked as Lord Kelvin's assistant at the University of Glasgow, and later became professor of mechanical engineering at Finsbury Technical College. He was a colleague of William Edward Ayrton and John Milne at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo, 1875‚Äì79, and was also a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1900 he was elected president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and from 1906‚Äì08 served as president of the Physical Society of London. Perry was a great admirer of his employer, Lord Kelvin. In the printing of his 1890 lecture on spinning tops, Perry inscribed the following acknowledgement: \\"This report of an experimental lecture is inscribed to Sir William Thomson, by his affectionate pupil, the lecturer, who hereby takes a convenient method of acknowledging the real author of whatever is worth publication in the following pages.\\" The book was later reprinted by Dover Publications in 1957 as Spinning Tops and Gyroscopic Motions. Although others (Max Schuler in Germany, Sperry in the USA) had been working on developing practical gyrocompasses, Perry collaborated with Sidney Brown to further develop these and they were awarded : \\"Gyro-compass\\" by John Perry, Sidney George Brown, filed August 1917; granted 1919. Perry received an honorary doctorate (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901.  Challenging Lord Kelvin  In 1895, Perry published a paper challenging Kelvin's assumption of low thermal conductivity inside the Earth,Perry, John (1895) \\"On the age of the earth,\\" Nature, 51 : 224-227, 341-342, 582-585. and thus disputing Kelvin's estimate that the Earth was only 20‚Äì400 million years old, but this had little impact. It was not until the discovery in 1903 that radioactive decay releases heat and the development a few years later of radiometric dating of rocks that it was accepted that the age of the earth was many times older, as Perry had argued. Perry's reasoning held that if the interior of the Earth was fluid, or partly fluid, it would transfer heat much more effectively than the conductivity which Kelvin assumed, and he stated that \\"much internal fluidity would practically mean infinite conductivity for our purpose.\\" Kelvin rejected this idea as there was no evidence of tidal deformation of the Earth's crust, and in response Perry made a reference to Kelvin's favourite demonstration of the slow deformation of shoemaker's wax to illustrate the supposed qualities of the presumed luminiferous aether thought then to be necessary to transmit light through space. Perry wrote that \\"the real basis of your calculation is your assumption that the solid earth cannot alter its shape ... even in 1000 million years, under the action of forces constantly tending to alter its shape, and yet we see the gradual closing up of passages in a mine, and we know that wrinkling and faults and other changes of shape are always going on in the earth under the action of long-continued forces. I know that solid rock is not like cobbler's wax, but 109 years is a long time, and the forces are great.\\" The failure of the scientific community to accept a fluid interior to the Earth held back ideas in geology until the concept was revived by proponents of continental drift, and even in the 1960s geophysical models were still being constructed on the basis that the Earth was solid.

He was born in Lusitania, in the city of Scallabis (modern Santar√©m in Portugal). He was also bishop of Girona.Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991) vol. 3, p. 1062  Early life  He was educated at Constantinople, where he devoted between 7-17 years to the study of Latin and Greek.  Career  = Imprisonment = When he returned to his homeland, he was imprisoned for several years in Barcelona. Isidore of Seville ascribes this to his refusal to join the Arian Church of the Visigothic realm in Hispania. Modern historians note that other contemporary Iberian sources, including John's own Chronicle do not attest a Visigothic campaign of persecution of Catholics until the revolt of Hermenegild divided Visigothic loyalties. The Visigothic persecutions of dissenters and Jews may be a more recent Catholic myth. Indeed, John wrote that, in 578, \\"Leovigild had peace to reside with his own people.\\" A more likely reason for John's detention was his lengthy stay at Constantinople, with the possibility that he might be a spy for the Byzantine governors in the far south of Iberia. An enforced stay in Barcelona certainly put him out of possible treasonous contact with the Byzantines. John does imply that Arians received favorable treatment under Leovigild, once, in connection with the Arian council convened by Leovigild in 580, where Catholic bishops were ignored. = Monastery = After Leovigild's death in 586, John was released and founded a Benedictine monastery at Biclaro (the exact site is undetermined), where he presided as abbot and finished his Chronicle (in 590), before he was appointed Catholic Bishop of Girona under the new episcopal government. = Bishop = John took part in the synods of Zaragoza (592), of Barcelona (599), and of Egara (Municipium Flavium Egara) (614). His chronicle, which is a continuation (from 567) of the chronicle of Victor of Tunnuna, in Africa (Chronicon continuans Victorem Tunnunensem), reaches to the year 590. It was printed as early as 1600. It is the most complete and reliable authority on Leovigild's stormy reign, and on the Visigothic conversion from Arianism to Catholicism. Three other chronicles cover parts of the Visigothic rule of Hispania: the bishop Hydatius, bishop Isidore of Seville, both of the doctrinally unified Catholic Visigothic establishment, and the fragmentary but apparently secular Chronicle of Zaragoza. A bishop of Girona known as Johannes Gerundensis (\\"John of Girona\\") seems to have been a successor of the chronicler, though some have identified him with the chronicler.

Kollek was re-elected five times, in 1969, 1973, 1978, 1983 and 1989. After reluctantly running for a seventh term in 1993 at the age of 82, he lost to Likud candidate and future Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert. During his tenure, Jerusalem developed into a modern city, especially after its reunification in 1967. He was once called \\"the greatest builder of Jerusalem since Herod.\\" Early life and marriage Theodor (Teddy) Kollek was born in Nagy-V√°zsony, 120 km from Budapest, Hungary as Kollek Tivadar. His parents, Alfred and Margaret, n√©e Fleischer, named him after Theodor Herzl. The family moved to Vienna in 1918.Obituary: Teddy Kollek, in The Telegraph, London, 3 January 2007 Growing up in the Austrian capital city, Kollek came to share his father Alfr√©d's Zionist convictions. Teddy Kollek (second from the right), with the Ein Gev Pioneers (1934‚Äì39) In 1935, three years before the Nazis seized power in Austria, the Kollek family immigrated to British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. In 1937, he was one of the founders of Kibbutz Ein Gev, on the shore of Lake Kinneret. That same year he married Tamar Schwarz. They had two children, a son, the film director Amos Kollek (born in 1947), and a daughter, Osnat.Kollek: A man with 'Viennese optimism' Intelligence services =The \\"Hunting Season\\"= In 1942 Kollek was appointed the Jewish Agency's deputy head of intelligence. Between January 1945 and May 1946 he was the Agency's chief external liaison officer in Jerusalem and was in contact with MI5's main representative as well as members of British Military Intelligence.Andrew, Christopher (2009) The Defence of the Realm. The Authorized History of MI5. Allen Lane. . Pages 355,356. In the 1940s, on behalf of the Jewish Agency (Sochnut) and as part of the \\"Hunting Season\\" or \\"Saison\\", Teddy Kollek was the Jewish Agency's contact person with the British Mandate MI5, providing information against right-wing Jewish underground groups Irgun and Lehi(known as \\"Stern Gang\\"). He succeeded Reuven Zaslani and preceded Zeev Sherf in this function, and was carrying out the Jewish Agency's policy of assisting the British in fighting these groups. On 10 August 1945 he revealed to MI5 the location of a secret Irgun training camp near Binyamina. Twenty-seven Irgun members were arrested in the raid that followed. =Second World War= During World War II, Kollek tried to represent Jewish interests in Europe on behalf of the Jewish Agency. =Cooperation with the USA= In 1947‚Äì48, he represented the Haganah in Washington, where he assisted in acquiring ammunition for Israel's then- fledgling army. Kollek was a key figure in creating an alliance between the Mossad and the CIA during the 1940s and 1950s. In national politics Kollek became a close ally of David Ben-Gurion, serving in the latter's governments from 1952 as the director general of the prime minister's office. Mayor of Jerusalem In 1965 Teddy Kollek succeeded Mordechai Ish-Shalom as Mayor of Jerusalem. On his motivations for seeking the mayor's office in Jerusalem, Kollek once recalled: :I got into this by accident[...] I was bored. When the city was united, I saw this as an historic occasion. To take care of it and show better care than anyone else ever has is a full life purpose. I think Jerusalem is the one essential element in Jewish history. A body can live without an arm or a leg, not without the heart. This is the heart and soul of it. During his tenure Jerusalem developed into a modern city, especially after its reunification in 1967. He was often called ‚Äúthe greatest builder of Jerusalem since Herod.‚Äù Kollek was re-elected five times, in 1969, 1973, 1978, 1983, and 1989 (with all but 1969 being direct elections), serving 28 years as mayor of Jerusalem. In a reluctant seventh bid for mayor in 1993, Kollek, aged 82, lost to Likud candidate Ehud Olmert. =Relationship with the Arab community= In the Six-Day War of 1967, East Jerusalem, which had been under Jordanian control since 1948, was captured by Israel. As mayor of a newly united Jerusalem, Kollek's approach toward the Arab inhabitants was governed by pragmatism. Within hours of the transfer of authority, he arranged for the provision of milk for Arab children. Some Israelis considered him pro-Arab. Kollek advocated religious tolerance and made numerous efforts to reach out to the Arab community during his tenure. Muslims continued to have access to al- Aqsa Mosque and Temple Mount for worship. While he was adamant that Jerusalem never be divided again and remain under Israeli sovereignty, he believed in concessions to reach a final settlement.Teddy Kollek and his life-long dedication Kollek's views on the annexation of East Jerusalem softened after leaving office. =Civic and cultural projects= Teddy Stadium Kollek dedicated himself to many cultural projects during his lengthy term in office, and served as the founder and head of the Jerusalem Foundation, through which he helped finance the projects. Kollek was also instrumental in the establishment of the Jerusalem Theater. The Israel Museum Kollek's most notable cultural project was the development and expansion of the Israel Museum. From 1965‚Äì1996, he was president of the museum, and officially designated its founder in 2000. When the museum celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1990, Kollek was named \\"Avi Ha-muze'on\\" (\\"father of the museum\\").The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, Magazine, Winter-Spring 2007, p.3 Through a leadership which spanned decades, Kollek raised millions of dollars from private donors for civic development projects and cultural programs. Kollek once remarked that Israel needed a strong army, but it also needed expressions of culture and civilization. Jerusalem zoo Teddy the elephant at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, named in honor of Kollek. Kollek was considered the \\"number-one friend\\" of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, which occupied a site in Romema from 1950‚Äì1991. Though the zoo attracted many visitors to its exhibits of animals, reptiles and birds mentioned in the Bible and was successful in breeding and protecting endangered species, it was considered small and inferior to zoos in Tel Aviv and Haifa. Kollek promoted the idea of moving the zoo to a larger location and upgrading it to a state- of-the-art institution. Around 1990, under the auspices of the Jerusalem Foundation, the Tisch family of New York agreed to underwrite the expensive undertaking. The zoo re-opened as The Tisch Family Zoological Garden in Jerusalem on a expanse near the neighborhood of Malha in 1993. Kollek helped the zoo raise money to build the elephant enclosure and to bring in female elephants from Thailand at $50,000 apiece. The zoo named its male elephant Teddy and one of its female elephants Tamar in honor of the mayor and his wife. For Kollek's 90th birthday in 2001, the zoo feted him and the Jerusalem Foundation unveiled a new sculpture garden dedicated in his honor. Retirement and death Kollek continued to be active in retirement, maintaining a five-day work week into his nineties, even as he became increasingly infirm. He and his wife lived in their walk-up Rehavia apartment until the mid-1990s, when they moved to Hod Yerushalayim, a retirement home in the Kiryat HaYovel neighborhood.Kollek Teddy Posters in Jerusalem mourning Teddy Kollek, 4 January 2007 Kollek died on 2 January 2007.

Another song not made available; \\"Trouble\\" is remembered by Ed Gilroy as the first song Madonna wrote (instead of \\"Tell the Truth\\", as Madonna recalls). * \\"(I Like) Love for Tender\\", \\"No Time for Love\\", \\"Bells Ringing\\" and \\"Drowning\\" are all featured on Madonna's studio demo tape with the band Emmy and the Emmy's in 1980. Other Emmy tracks such as \\"Simon Says\\" are not included here because they were either live recordings or already legally released on a small indie label. They belong listed on the Madonna discography page. NOTE: A studio version of \\"Simon Says\\" is included on the Shamrock Tape. See below for corrected track listing. \\"Do You?\\" and \\"Hothouse Flower\\" were performed in an art film of which excerpts have been shown on TV. * \\"Tell the Truth\\" and \\"Hothouse Flower\\" and \\"Simon Says\\" and \\"I Got Trouble (Roll Over It)\\" and \\"Oh Oh (The Sky Is Blue)\\" and \\"Nobody Wants to Be Alone (Once I Thought I Was Good)\\" and \\"Well Well\\" ‚Äì early recordings recorded on the \\"Shamrock\\" reel-to-reel tape. It was recently auctioned to a private owner. \\"Tell the Truth\\" was allegedly the very first song Madonna ever recorded (with the help of Dan Gilroy of the band The Breakfast Club). In 2005 Madonna sang the chorus of \\"Tell the Truth\\" during an interview with Parkinson on UK TV. She also discussed writing the song in Rolling Stone magazine (October 2009). * \\"Take Me (I Want You)\\" and \\"Best Girl\\" and \\"Nobody's Fool\\", with Emmy And The Emmys. Demo recordings of \\"Take Me (I Want You)\\" have leaked online. Live versions of \\"Best Girl\\" and \\"Nobody's Fool\\" songs have also leaked, along with live versions of other Emmy-era tracks (already mentioned) from this period. * \\"Prisoner\\" and \\"Head Over Heels\\" and \\"Get Away\\" and \\"Call on Me\\" ‚Äì possible early recordings from the Emmys era; Those titles are listed on a hand-written set-list spotted in some pictures of a 1980/1981 live gig, taken by photographer George DuBose. Those pictures are famous among collectors as being related to the Underground Club performance. There is actually no evidence that Madonna recorded those songs on tape, they could be compositions written and intended just for live concerts; some audio-tape from rehearsals (featuring those songs) may or may not exist. The existence of these tracks has been confirmed as being on the actual set-list. Those Underground Club pictures can be seen in a large number of fan sites' photo-galleries and even on George DuBose's official site. * \\"We Live in a House\\", written by Josh Braun, Janis Galloway and Madonna in 1982. US copyright registration # PAu-1-843-482. It was recorded with the group Spinal Root Gang after Madonna's roommate Janis Galloway introduced her to them. Janis Galloway later became the wife of Michael Rosenblatt from Warner Bros. Records. Sample lyric: \\"We live in a house, and people just don't care. We live in a house, they don't go anywhere.\\" Madonna screams at one point: \\"You can't come into my house.\\" = Solo vocal recordings = * \\"I Want You\\", \\"Love on the Run\\", \\"Get Up\\" and \\"High Society\\", a Pat Benatar style pop-rock Madonna demo produced under the direction of Madonna's first manager Camille Barbone of August Artists Ltd and Gotham Sound Studios in New York City with guitarist Jon Gordon in 1981. All four of these tracks have leaked on the internet in high quality. Two more songs were recorded at Media Sound Studios but not used on the 1981 demo circulating at the time called \\"Remembering Your Touch\\" and \\"Are You Ready For It\\" which are also reasonably easily available for internet download. * \\"Shake Your Head (Let's Go To Bed)\\" Madonna recorded lead vocal with Don and David for the Was (Not Was) album Born to Laugh at Tornadoes produced in Detroit in 1982‚Äì83. The released vocal were by Ozzy Osbourne with backing vocals by Kathy Kosins and Carol Hall. Madonna and John \\"Jellybean\\" Benitez are both in the album credits. During a May 2006 Kathy Kosins phone interview with Bruce Baron it was revealed that Ozzy recorded his vocal first. Kathy and Carol added vocals in Detroit. Kathy's vocals were intended to be replaced by Madonna by producer Don Was. Madonna's label Sire Records did not agree to the release and Kathy's vocals were restored for the ZE Records release as a backing track. Kathy then became a longtime Was (not Was) contributor. Madonna originally became involved via her friendship with Stephen Bray and his group The Breakfast Club who were also signed with ZE Records (later acquired by MCA). Madonna requested her original vocal not to be used in an early 1990s remix released as a single in Europe to support a Was (Not Was) Greatest Hits album. Kim Basinger did the new vocals. The 1990s remix version with Madonna's vocals leaked onto the internet in April 2008. * \\"Sidewalk Talk\\", written by Madonna for former producer and boyfriend John \\"Jellybean\\" Benitez. The 1983 commercially released version features vocalist Catherine Buchanan on lead vocals and Madonna singing on the chorus and bridge. The original demo version with Madonna on the lead vocal remains unreleased and was produced with Stephen Bray as confirmed by interviews. * \\"Afterglo\\", \\"Rock Your Body\\", \\"Girl with Stars in Her Eyes\\", \\"Swing with Me\\" and \\"Cherish\\". In early 2011 several other previously unknown songs came to light penned by Madonna via handwritten lyric sheets on an auction site. Cherish is different from the song of the same title from the Like A Prayer album released in 1989. To date, these songs have not been released.  1982‚Äì89  = Madonna = * \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\" The released version was produced by Reggie Lucas in 1982 and appeared as the B-side of her \\"True Blue\\" single in 1986, though this is an alternate version to the unreleased version mentioned above. Originally intended to be Madonna's first single. Three more separate unreleased studio versions were also produced each by Mark Kamins, Stephen Bray and John \\"Jellybean\\" Benitez. They were all shelved by Sire Records when the song was recorded and released in 1983 by the female disco act Barracuda on 12-inch vinyl Epic Records release 49-04264. Credited as written only by Stephen Bray due to a publisher contract with July 4 Music. It was actually a Madonna co-write so she is understood to have taken sole writing credit for \\"Everybody\\" in trade. \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\" was included in the US compilation album Revenge of the Killer B's, Vol. 2. * \\"Physical Attraction\\", US copyright registration PAu-484-430 from February 1983 credits words and music created in 1982 only to Madonna as sole author as does April 1983 publisher transfer registration PAu-506-929. Producer Reggie Lucas is not credited as the sole author of this song until 1984 registration PA-210-598 for the 12\\" commercial single release for the work created and published in 1983 and has been the only credited songwriter since. * \\"Writer's Block\\", listed in the MCPS-PRS database as being written by Madonna and Richard Lewis Warren for the 1984 TV show Cover Up starring Jon Erik-Hexum and Jennifer O'Neill. An episode by this name first aired on November 24, 1984 (Season 1, Episode 7) without crediting either Madonna or Richard Lewis Warren. However, that episode does include \\"Lucky Star\\" which means this entry is most likely an error in the database. = Vision Quest soundtrack = * \\"Warning Signs\\", the third Madonna song recorded for the soundtrack to the film but never used. It remains unheard by the public to this day. A collaboration with Stephen Bray from 1984, US copyright registration# PAu-590-962. Bray describes it as a cool synth track. The lyric sheet reveals the opening intro as \\"I see danger up ahead\\", \\"Warning (echo), Warning (echo)\\". Chorus is \\"Warning I see danger up ahead. I can see it in your eyes, and it's really no surprise. Because, I can see your warning signs\\". Supposed complete lyrics for the song have surfaced online on various lyric websites. = Like a Virgin = * \\"(title uncertain)\\", Simon Le Bon of the group Duran Duran mentioned in a mid-1980s interview for the BBC TV show Breakfast that Madonna did backing vocals for them that were never released. On Duran Duran's official website in the 'Ask Katy' section the band members denied that Madonna ever recorded backing vocals on any of their tracks. * \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\", written by Madonna and Stephen Bray. Unreleased title track for the Orion Pictures movie of the same name according to former Madonna collaborator Stephen Bray from 1999 interview. Another \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\" title song was written by Michael Bramon. \\"Into the Groove\\" overshadowed both \\"Susan\\" themes, and both were shelved. = True Blue = * \\"Working My Fingers to the Bone\\" and \\"Pipeline\\", recorded with frequent collaborator Stephen Bray. * \\"Spotlight\\", original version 1985 US copyright registration PAu-716-379 written in 1984. Curtis Hudson & Lisa Stevens. Stevens' demo version sounds remarkably like \\"Holiday\\" which she also co- wrote. Madonna and Stephen Bray changed lyrics and music to this in 1985 via copyright registration PAu-924-278. The demo also has a different rhythm and chorus melody. Sample lyric \\"Spotlight shine on you. Be what you want to be, do what you want to do\\" and \\"Spotlight shine so bright, spotlight shine tonight\\". * \\"(title(s) unknown)\\", musician Fred ZarrZarr's interview with Mark Bego in the book Blonde Ambition (1992, Harmony Books) tried to write two or three songs with Madonna around the time of \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" but never finished. * \\"Each Time You Break My Heart\\", written and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray. Nick Kamen later recorded his version of this song with Madonna as backing vocals. It was a big hit in Europe (number 1 in Italy, number 5 in the UK in November 1986). Madonna's version has appeared on various file-sharing networks. Bray described Madonna's demo in an interview with Bruce Baron for Goldmine Magazine as \\"virtually unchanged from the version later recorded and released by Nick Kamen\\". * \\"Tell Me\\" Stephen Bray confirmed the existence of this demo with Madonna singing as the lead vocal; in the Extended version, Nick Kamen sings lead vocals and Madonna sings backing vocals and a solo. * \\"I Want You\\" Stephen Bray confirmed the existence of this unreleased track in an interview with Madonna music expert, Peter Magennis in 2009. To date this song has never been leaked. = Like a Prayer = * \\"Possessive Love\\", written and recorded with Patrick Leonard, Madonna and Jai Winding. CMRRA database# 875911 Madonna's original demo was given to singer Marilyn Martin for her to record. The song was included on her 1988 album This is Serious. The song was also released as a single by Atlantic Records in 1988 but did not do very well. ASCAP title code #460268111 * \\"Love Attack\\" and \\"First There's a Kiss\\" Two songs Madonna recorded and produced with Stephen Bray but were never used. In 1989 Madonna talked in a Bravo magazine about \\"First There's a Kiss\\" as explaining that it is a song about the friends she lost because of AIDS. * \\"Just A Dream\\" (original Madonna demo) Written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard. Given later to her long-time backing vocalist Donna DeLory for her MCA self-titled debut solo album. Madonna does appear on backing vocals, but the original Madonna lead vocal recording remains unreleased. DeLory's version did manage to crack the US Dance Club Play Chart. * \\"Angels With Dirty Faces\\" Bruce Gaitsch, co-writer of \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and guitarist on \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Like a Prayer\\" alluded to the fact that he was involved with this unreleased track in an interview with Madonna music expert, Peter Magennis in 2006. \\"I have a tape somewhere of some songs I had to learn parts from and none of these songs are on it. But there is a song called Angels with Dirty Faces on it that is killer\\". On July 11, 2017, the co-writer of the track, Patrick Leonard, shared a 20 second video clip of the song on his official Instagram page. On July 22, 2019, Patrick Leonard published the full demo on his YouTube channel. *\\"I Surrender Dear\\" was recorded for the 1989 film, Bloodhounds of Broadway, where Madonna sang it with actress Jennifer Grey, but the song was not included in the soundtrack and has never appeared on any legally published records.  1990‚Äì99  = I'm Breathless and The Immaculate Collection = * \\"Dick Tracy\\", written by Patrick Leonard. This did not appear on the I'm Breathless album. ASCAP title code# 340325268. Another \\"Dick Tracy\\" performed by Madonna is listed in the APRA database id code# GW04472893 and was written solely by Daniel Elfman. * \\"Dog House\\" Another title reported in Billboard magazine circa 1990 for the film Dick Tracy. A song titled \\"You're in the Dog House Now\\" performed by Brenda Lee and co-written by Andy Paley was included on the Dick Tracy soundtrack. This is a possible replacement for the Madonna recorded track, considering the precedents of Madonna's own recordings of \\"Now I'm Following You\\" which was replaced in the film by a version sung by co-writer Andy Paley, and \\"Back In Business\\" being replaced by a same-titled track by Stephen Sondheim. * Various \\"Dick Tracy\\" demos ‚Äì Leaked on 7-inch bootleg vinyl in the early-1990s at record collector shows under the name of \\"MA-HONEY\\". Rehearsal sound quality is rather poor and the printed jacket track listing was incorrect and is corrected as follows \\"More\\", \\"I Always Get My Man\\" (actually \\"Sooner or Later\\"), \\"What Can You Get\\" (actually \\"What Can You Lose\\", sung by Madonna only (ie without her duet partner Mandy Patinkin)). These recordings (which included two different versions of 'I Always Get My Man' and a demo version of 'Now I'm Following You') were included on a bootleg album called 'Calendar Girl' in 1990. This album is credited to a \\"B. Mahoney\\" and includes the official Color Mix of \\"True Blue\\", four songs from the Blond Ambition Tour live in Barcelona, the faux-Madonna track 'Lies in Your Eyes', and a recording of Madonna singing \\"Santa Baby\\" taken from the A Very Special Christmas compilation released in 1987. * \\"To Love You\\", written by Madonna and Andy Paley. Listed in the Warner-Chappel database but remains unreleased. The demo was re-recorded in 1994 but it is unreleased too. The supposed full lyrics for this song have been published on several song lyric websites. * \\"Get Over\\", recorded with Stephen Bray around the time of the Immaculate Collection. (It was going to be the third new song on the greatest hits album.) Madonna's demo version remains unreleased. The song was later recorded and released by actor/model Nick Scotti with Madonna backing vocals produced by Madonna and Shep Pettibone for the film Nothing But Trouble in 1992. Listed as song #301415 in the CMRRA database. It was also included on Nick Scotti's self- titled debut album, and released as a single. = Erotica = * \\"Dear Father\\", an unreleased collaboration with Andr√© Betts and Mic Murphy (former member of duo The System). An uptempo dance track. Part of the lyrics include: \\"Dear Father forgive me/ I don't know what I've done...\\" The song appears in the EMI Music publishing database and in the UK based MCPS system. APRA id# GW09823950. This demo leaked in its entirety online in June 2008. * \\"Love Hurts\\" ‚Äì A unique song title listed in the discography of producer/remixer Junior Vasquez. See Junior Vasquez Music Site. This is an early version of ‚ÄòErotica‚Äô with a different chorus and slightly altered lyrics (‚ÄúI‚Äôll hit you like a Mack truck‚Äù compared to the official version‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hit you like a truck.‚Äù) Leaked to the internet in March 2017. * \\"You Are The One\\", U.S. copyright registration# PAu-1-605-636 Song from The Rain Tapes written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Tony Shimkin not used on the album. The lyrics include, \\"You are the one, my only one ‚Äì you are the one for me\\". The sound is very dance/club/house. It was abandoned in the demo stage. On December 19, the complete lyrics leaked onto the Internet. The refrain runs, \\"You (you) are the one (are the one), Make me feel, Our love is alive...\\" A fake fan-made version leaked on the fake Rain Tapes. The full demo leaked online on July 27, 2014. * \\"Shame\\", U.S. copyright registration# PAu-1-605-637 and separate ASCAP registration# 491644325. Also a CMRRA song registration# 1776484 Song from The Rain Tapes not used on the album. The song opens with a spoken intro, \\"Why do you wanna waste your life away? It's a shame.\\" Later she sings, \\"Anyone can learn to fly, keep your head up...\\" She also says, \\"You've got no one to blame.\\" The chorus starts with \\"It's a Shaaaaaame\\", which sounds similar to the song of the same title and time period by Monie Love. This is possibly the source of the rumor that she and Madonna were going to do something together. The similarity ends there, with Madonna's \\"Shame\\" breaking off into its own unique melody. A 20-second clip has leaked on the Internet. On December 19, the complete lyrics were leaked. The full demo leaked online on July 27, 2014. * \\"Goodbye to Innocence\\", alternate version written and produced by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Tony Shimkin. U.S. copyright registration# PAu-1-605-640 ‚Äì This is very different from the commercially released remixed version which appeared on the various artists collection Just Say Roe and in a further revised dub from as \\"Up Down Suite\\" as one of the B-sides for the \\"Rain\\" single. The unreleased demo versions use the same theme and many of the same lyrics, but everything is switched around. It is a different vocal recording (strong-and-clear unlike the commercial mix). Much of the song's melody is different including the chorus. The arrangement is pure pop-funk-dance, no club remix style here. Extra lyrics include the spoken line: \\"Goodbye to innocence, anonyminity [sic], peace of mind..\\" The chorus includes: \\"You know you'd better stop, stop and think...\\" A full demo of this song, called \\"Straight Pass\\", leaked onto the Internet in February 2008. * \\"Actions Speak Louder Than Words\\" (two alternate demo versions) ‚Äì Both versions are without the eastern instrument found in the released version simply called \\"Words\\". Instead the synth keys that are found at the end of the commercial mix are used during the chorus. There is also a subtle guitar-like sound. Additional lyrics include \\"I can't fight with your words, they come disguised as love, but your words are so cruel\\", and \\"I can't fight with your words, they pretend to be kind, but your words are for fools\\". The backing vocals and bridge arrangements are slightly different. U.S. copyright office registration PAu-1-605-641. As with most of the Rain Tapes tracks, fakes are in circulation which have no relevance to the authentic demos. Finally, one of the real demos leaked online on September 26, 2019. * \\"Erotica\\" (unreleased demo). U.S. copyright registration PAu-1-605-642 ‚Äì Known among fans as \\"You Thrill Me\\" since these words are contained in the alternate lyrics. Madonna incorporated this demo into the version of Erotica that she performed on her 2006 Confessions Tour. It is significantly different from the released album version. The verse lyrics are the same as those used on the album, though there is no trace of the familiar chorus lyric \\"Erotic, Erotic, put your hands all over my body\\". Instead Madonna sings a different chorus line with a different melody in the same type of voice that ends with the line: :\\"....You are who you are....and I :Wouldn't want to change a thing...in spite of :All the pain that love can bring... :Tell me, what can I do? I'm so in love with you. :You thrill me, surround me, you fill me :You send me, you put me in a trance :You fill me, inside of me, you take me :You thrill me, you put me in a trance.\\" :The instrumentation is approximately the same as the commercial mix but the released mix is more distinctive, more complex, and more exotic. The Rough Mix includes the complete refrain, \\"Erotica, romance, I'd like to put you in a trance...\\". A full demo of this song, called \\"Final Demo 2\\", leaked onto the internet in February 2008. * \\"Jitterbug\\" (song fragment, about 30‚Äì45 seconds) ‚Äì Included on The Rain Tapes cassette tapes submitted by Shep Pettibone to the U.S. copyright office. It was mostly taped over, but showed up between two of the other tracks. It is listed on the handwritten tape label, but it has no copyright registration of its own. The title was originally spelled with a \\"G\\", but was written over darker with a \\"J\\" in blue ink. It features typical generic Shep Pettibone dance music with Madonna finishing up with \\"Jitterbug, Jitterbug\\". Madonna stops singing but the music continues, and she can be heard asking: \\"Is this gonna go on forever and ever? Somebody end this dance lesson.\\" The music abruptly stops. She then says into the microphone: \\"There were some cute ideas right there.\\" A fake is in circulation which uses a Cathy Dennis instrumental and a peculiar vocal which seems to be a recreation of the word \\"Jitterbug\\" using the relevant vowels and consonants from other Madonna songs as well as an excerpt from Truth Or dare ‚Äì \\"Do I have to listen to this?\\" In 2011, Tony Shimkin, co-producer of the track, confirmed in an interview that this song was intended to be featured in A League of Their Own together with \\"This Used to Be My Playground\\". However, it was abandoned because, as Shimkin states: \\"we were in the middle of so many other things at the time and maybe there wasn‚Äôt a necessity for it in the movie.\\" Leaked onto the internet in September 2019. * \\"Thief of Hearts\\" (alternate demo versions) U.S. copyright registration# PAu-1-605-643 ‚Äì Uses slightly different intro, bridge and outro arrangements. One version has what was eventually the end of the song placed at the beginning. One uses the voice of a southern black woman to say the line \\"sit your ass down\\" instead of Madonna herself as done on the commercial release, and Madonna is briefly heard laughing immediately after. A full-length version of one of the demos ‚Äì Old Music ‚Äì became available on file-sharing networks in February 2008. The others in circulation are, as before, fakes. The 'New Music' demo leaked in September 2019. * \\"Secret Garden (Demo Version)\\", demo version of the released last album track. It features same lyrics and music, but the vocals are stronger and clearer, with some alternate music choice, i.e. in some points there's only the bass line and Madonna's voice. It clocks 3'47, and has been available on peer-to-peer sharing software since July 2008. = Bedtime Stories = * \\"Something's Coming Over Me\\" ‚Äì The unreleased original version of the song \\"Secret\\" written and produced with Shep Pettibone and then abandoned. US copyright registration# PAu-1-889-253. This version does not have the downbeat guitar R&B; vibe of the released song. During the unique bridge of the unreleased demo the music drops out and Madonna speaks: \\"I see your love coming down...\\" Then the bass and the drum kick back up in club anthem style where she sings: \\"Something's coming over me...\\" Shep Pettibone later did get co-writing credit for \\"Secret\\" due to this initial work which he did not originally get when the album Bedtime Stories was first released in 1994. * \\"I Will Always Have You\\" ‚Äì The unreleased original version of what became the released song \\"Inside Of Me\\" recorded with Shep Pettibone and then abandoned. US copyright registration# PAu-1-889-251. This ballad sounds more like the familiar style of \\"Crazy for You\\" or \\"You'll See\\" than what later became the soft, lullaby-like released version. The released song's theme is all about Madonna cherishing the memory of a loved one, but in this demo she also wants to be the object of the song to also be remembered. The words \\"inside of me\\" are hardly used but many of the same lyrics are switched around. The melody is significantly different from the released version. * \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover (feat. Tupac Shakur)\\", an alternate version of the song where, instead of Me'Shell NdegeOcello rapping the breakdown, Tupac is rapping. This version was originally meant to be released, but was scrapped due to serious criminal charges brought against the late rapper and since the album was to present a kinder, more gentle Madonna, any unnecessary controversy was best avoided. Leaked to the internet in November 2009. * \\"Love Won't Wait\\" (original 1994 demo), a song abandoned and not used on the Bedtime Stories album. Madonna and Shep Pettibone later gave it to former Take That singer Gary Barlow. It was not written specifically for him. He received a demo tape with that song including her lead and backing vocals. The unreleased Madonna demo is US copyright registration# PAu-1-889-250. The demo leaked onto file-sharing services from sources unknown around the year 2000. Madonna's version has a strong clear vocal with bubblegum instrumentation that vaguely sounds like synth-Motown. * \\"Bring It\\", written and produced by Madonna and Shep Pettibone but never released. US copyright registration# PAu-1-889-252. Partial lyric reads: \\"I know your love is bad for me, but I won't give up until you bring it to me.\\" * \\"Goodtime\\" and \\"Tongue Tied\\", listed in the Warner/Chappell Music database, along with \\"Bring It\\". All three songs are listed as written by Madonna and Shep Pettibone, copyright ASCAP. * \\"Right On Time\\", written by Madonna and Dallas Austin. Listed in the European MCPS database. APRA id# GW0916567. = Something to Remember = * \\"I Can't Forget\\" An unreleased collaboration with David Foster. Recorded with two other released songs for the Something to Remember retrospective album but this one was never used. BMI work# 2133633 published by Peermusic Ltd. and Warner/Chappell Music. The song was later recorded by Tilt. They released their version titled \\"Come Closer\\" on their 2006 album Vaults. Madonna is credited as writer of the song. The song was also given to Canadian singer Angelica DiCastro for her album \\"Beautiful Feeling\\". The song is credited to David Foster and Madonna. A couple of clips from Madonna's demo version leaked onto the internet on September 26, 2008. On February 17, 2010, Madonna's demo version leaked to the internet in full. * \\"You'll Stay\\", written with Patrick Leonard and appeared in publishing records. Also found at the APRA site, song id# GW15524580. * \\"Indian Summer\\", written in 1995. Found as ID #GW14567699. A short excerpt of the song was used in a 1995 Japanese Takara commercial, with the slogan \\"Takara Jun Legend\\". Lyrics include \\"How can I be pure (how can I be pure), All the strength I have, is breaking me, How can I be sure (How can I be sure), Where the road I chose, is taking me.\\" = Ray of Light = Unreleased demos recorded for the album Ray of Light written with Rick Nowels. The CMRRA has Madonna, Rick Nowels and Greg Fitzgerald: * \\"Gone, Gone, Gone\\" ‚Äì Song from the early stages of Ray Of Light in 1997, when Orbit wasn't asked yet for the album. The song appeared on the internet. Sometimes the song is also called \\"Gone Gone Gone (This Love Affair Is Over)\\". * \\"Like A Flower\\" ‚Äì CMRRA song registration# 888544. The demo of this song leaked onto the Internet around 2003. It was later given to Italian singer Laura Pausini for her 2004 album Resta In Ascolto (Italian for \\"Remain listening!\\") and re- titled \\"Mi Abbandono A Te\\" (Italian for \\"I Give Up on You\\"). ASCAP song registration# 431644652; CMRRA song registration# 1012340. This song was recorded also in Spanish with the title \\"Me Abandono A Ti\\" for the Spanish version of \\"Resta In Ascolto\\" named \\"Escucha\\" (Spanish for \\"Listen!\\"). * \\"Revenge\\" ‚Äì CMRRA song registration# 742435. The song was one of the early demos of the Ray Of Light album from 1997, produced by Greg Fitzgerald and Rick Nowells in late 1997 before William Orbit's involvement in the project \\"Ray Of Light\\". In 2002 it was rumored to be the new recorded song from Madonna for the James Bond movie, and the leaked demo even got some airplay. In early 2005 it was also rumored to be Madonna's new single from her then upcoming album Confessions On A Dancefloor. The song has since been recorded by English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, as revealed by Peter Magennis in an interview with Greg Fitzgerald for his July 2008 cover feature for UK magazine, Record Collector (issue #351). A vinyl acetate exists, the version is 3 minutes 45 seconds. Other songs from this era: * \\"Be Careful\\", written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard only, APRA song id# GW23038624. A possible early version of the song \\"Be Careful (Cuidado Con Mi Corazon)\\" recorded with Ricky Martin and William Orbit, APRA song id# GW1552449. Leonard is not credited on the released Madonna-Orbit version with Ricky Martin but he has his own separate Madonna-Leonard documented entry in the Warner-Chappell publishing database. Oddly, the CMRRA lists them all, along with Susan Leonard, as co-writers together on one song work# 732670. The ASCAP database lists only Madonna and William Orbit as writers, with the song listed as \\"Cuidado Con Mi Corazon\\". In September 2010, another supposed demo leaked. This file was titled \\"Corazon\\" and contains Madonna singing over typical William Orbit synths. This may in fact be a fan creation and not a real demo recording as the music appears to be sampled from William Orbit's single \\"Dice\\" for Finley Quaye in collaboration with Beth Orton. * \\"No Substitute For Love\\", the original name for what became \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\" with different lyrics, vocal melody and instrumentation. The chorus starting: \\"Face the truth, no substitute for love\\". The song is also without the San Sebastian Strings sample of \\"Why I Follow the Tigers\\" that is present in the released version. This version has leaked onto the internet. * \\"Regfresando,\\" a Madonna and Patrick Leonard collaboration of unknown origin, listed in the Warner-Chappell database as Regfresando. APRA song id# GW19069760. The never released title might actually be a misspelling for the Spanish word Regresando which translates to English as meaning Returning. Until additional information is provided, the inclusion of the letter f in the original word spelling is thought by many fans to be nonsensical and probably listed incorrectly in the publisher database. * \\"You'll Stay,\\" a variation of \\"Like A Flower\\" produced by Patrick Leonard. The song leaked in February 2019. * \\"I'll Be Gone\\" and \\"Never Love A Stranger\\" produced by Babyface. Both songs leaked in 2019 along with other demos from this era. *An early version of \\"Skin\\" called \\"Flirtation Dance\\" produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard.  2000‚Äì09  = Music = * \\"Alone Again\\", a Madonna co-write with Rick Nowels, CMRRA song registration# 1775314. A song widely publicised in the media in 2002 as having been recorded by Kylie Minogue. The Minogue version was supposed to be the B-side to her \\"Come into My World\\" single, but the song remained unreleased until it was featured in the Kylie documentary \\"White Diamond\\", which premiered on October 16, 2007. Madonna and Rick Nowels are credited as writers. Madonna is also thanked in the credits of the film. Madonna has two ASCAP entries for this song. Her own version remains unreleased. * \\"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\\" Madonna and Orbit covered this ABBA song during the Music sessions. The demo and the Orbit instrumental leaked onto the internet on August 15, 2008. * \\"Little Girl\\" and \\"La Petite Jeune Fille\\" (translation: \\"The Little Girl\\") Written and produced with William Orbit, recorded during the Music sessions. The original ballad \\"Little Girl\\" leaked onto the internet on September 18, 2010. An early demo instrumental version of the song, with the title of 'Dear Pumpkin' leaked onto the internet in April 2011. Confirmed ASCAP title codes 420566552. 420566570 and 430653519. The second version of the song, \\"La Petite Jeune Fille\\" with similar lyrics, is an up-tempo dance song (resembling \\"Runaway Lover\\" from the same album) and leaked on the internet on December 14, 2011. * \\"Liquid Love\\", co-written and produced by William Orbit, originates from late 1999, presumably from the same sessions that yielded \\"Amazing\\" and \\"Runaway Lover\\", which would end up being featured on her Music album a year later. Madonna confirmed in a 2005 interview with Attitude that the track was also supposed to be on the album but was axed because it gave her \\"the wrong tingles\\". When the song leaked onto the internet on June 3, 2006, it became clear that the song \\"Bubble Universe\\" from William Orbit's album Hello Waveforms was actually based on the same instrumental track. An alternate mix of \\"Liquid Love\\" leaked onto the internet on August 15, 2008. * \\"Mysore Smile\\". Written and produced with William Orbit but never used or released. Instrumental leaked by William Orbit in 2013. It appeared to be an early version of \\"Cyber-Raga\\", a B-side for \\"Music\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and also a bonus track for the Japanese and Australian editions of Music, the album. Mysore is a city in India, a center of yoga and meditation study. * \\"Run\\". Written and produced with William Orbit but never used or released. Confirmed ASCAP title code 480358398. \\"Run\\" has since been released in instrumental form on William Orbit's official Streamcast site, with the track retitled \\"Forbidden Planet\\". It was also revealed by Peter Magennis in a 2008 interview with madonnalicious.com that Swedish girl group Sahara Hotnights recorded a cover of \\"Run\\" that remains unreleased, as was revealed to Peter during his interview with long-time Orbit collaborator, Rico Conning. On January 11, 2011, William Orbit commented on \\"Run\\" on his Twitter account. He stated that he would not release the song, after receiving multiple requests from fans to leak the song in full. Clips of Madonna's Run demo leaked onto the internet on April 19, 2011, the full demo leaking two days later. * \\"Arioso\\", written and produced by Madonna and William Orbit. The title was misspelled as \\"Ariosa\\". In classical music, arioso is a type of solo vocal piece, usually occurring in an opera. Literally, arioso means airy. This song is actually from where the notorious Wonderland 47-seconds track ‚Äì used for a TV series from 1999 ‚Äì comes (see below). A 30-second snippet leaked online, on August 4, 2014.\` The song leaked in full on December 25, 2014 amidst the mass leak of demos from her album Rebel Heart. The demo was based on Johann Sebastian Bach's Arioso, Adagio in G from Cantata BWV 156. * \\"Wonderland\\", the 45-second score to the short lived ABC TV show of the same name. The series aired only two episodes due to controversial content which viewers found disturbing. ASCAP title code 530521409. Written by Madonna and William Orbit. The full track remained unreleased until \\"Arioso\\" surfaced at Christmas 2014 (see above). When various other Madonna demos recorded with William Orbit leaked onto the internet in the summer of 2008, a slightly different version of this track leaked, crediting actor Rupert Everett as a co-vocalist (cf. William Orbit's blog post 54). * \\"The Funny Song\\". ASCAP Title Code: 501807576. Writers: Ciccone Madonna L. Madonna performed a live version of this song as part of her 2001 Drowned World Tour setlist, calling it her \\"brand new song\\". Madonna recorded a studio version in preparation for the tour, along with the rest of the setlist. While most of the other studio recorded setlist songs have been made available online, the studio version of this song remains unleaked. The track is also listed in the Warner/Chappell Music database with Madonna again credited as sole composer. The song is often listed as \\"Oh Dear Daddy\\" or \\"The Funny Song (Oh Dear Daddy)\\" on lyric web sites, due to its chorus. * \\"(title(s) unknown)\\", two songs recorded with Belgian-Congolese fusion group Zap Mama mixed by Pairs-based Bengali artist Subhendu Bapi Das Baul says the Screen India June 8, 2001. Plus a third recording is a Madonna guest vocal on a Bapi Das Baul track says the India Today April 2, 2001. Ultimately, Shubhendu ended up cutting not one, but two tracks. So far, these collaborations have not surfaced. = Die Another Day soundtrack = * \\"Can't You See My Mind\\" Recorded and produced with French- techno producer Mirwais Ahmadza√Ø for the James Bond film Die Another Day. Widely reported in the media and was revealed to be an alternate title for \\"Die Another Day\\". Listing confirmed at Warner-Chappell Music Publishing. Also ASCAP title code# 330991414. = American Life = * \\"Cool Song\\" is a track written with Mirwais and Monte Pittman. A remixed version by Paul Oakenfold, retitled \\"It's So Cool\\", appears as an iTunes-only bonus track on Madonna's greatest hits compilation Celebration (see below). The original recording from 2002 leaked in full onto the internet on August 31, 2010. It features a stripped-down, acoustic performance by Madonna and includes a children's choir during the final chorus. Another recording without the choir leaked on September 1, 2010 and is most likely an earlier version of the 2002 recording. * \\"The Game\\" is a song written and produced with Mirwais. It became available on file-sharing networks in August 2008. The song has a stripped-down acoustic folk feel. * \\"Set the Right\\" is a song produced by Mirwais and recorded during the American Life sessions. It was later suggested to be titled as \\"To the Left, To the Right\\" or \\"Set To Right\\" without further proof or citation. The song leaked in full as \\"Set the Right\\" on Internet on September 18, 2010. * \\"React\\". Listed on the BMI Music Licensing website. BMI Work #7337527. Composers are Ahmadzai, Mirwais and Ciccone, Madonna L. The song remains unleaked. = Re-Invention Tour era & musicals projects = * \\"I'm in Love with Love\\" A song supposedly written with Mirwais and Monte Pittman during the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. It was actually recorded between American Life and the \\"Post Re-Invention Tour Musicals\\". To confuse this timeline, the individual who leaked the song mixed it with the original \\"I Love New York\\" from I'm Going To Tell You A Secret. Both of these tracks are indicative of the sound originally conceptualised for the next album, before the project evolved into what became Confessions On A Dance Floor. The full song leaked on Internet on September 20, 2010. A low-quality clip of an alternate version with different lyrics has leaked, as well. * \\"Miss You\\", \\"If You Go Away\\", \\"How High\\", \\"Curtain\\", \\"The Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Is this Love (Bon D'Accord)\\" ‚Äì among a number of songs written for a planned musical Hello Suckers, a 1920s-style musical loosely based on the life of Texas Guinan.Scan of Attitude Magazine interview Songs were written with a number of co-writers including Patrick Leonard and Mirwais Ahmadza√Ø. Lyrics from \\"How High\\" were later reworked into a song for Confessions on a Dance Floor. Some lyrics from \\"Is This Love\\" were later re-used on the song \\"Voices\\" on the album Hard Candy. \\"The Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" was planned to be included on The Re-Invention Tour, but was later reworked with Madonna's brother-in-law Joe Henry. Ultimately, the song did not surface until the album Hard Candy following further development with Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and Nate Hills. \\"Is this Love (Bon D'Accord)\\" has since been leaked to the internet. \\"If You Go Away\\" is based on the classic \\"Ne me quitte pas\\" by Jaques Brel. The English version has been covered by a wide range of artists, including Marlene Dietrich, Shirley Bassey and Tom Jones. Madonna's version leaked onto the internet on September 2, 2010. \\"Miss You\\" was also planned for the musical and has more of an acoustic folk feel to it and leaked onto the internet on September 3, 2010, some lyrics were later re-used on the song \\"Like It or Not\\" from the album Confessions on a Dance Floor. * \\"(titles unknown)\\" ‚Äì A second musical to have been directed by filmmaker Luc Besson was also in pre- production during 2005, but was abandoned when Madonna read the script and was dissatisfied with the result. See Observer Guardian UK Madonna interview Nov 2005. = Confessions on a Dance Floor = * \\"Get Together\\", original unreleased version, produced by Anders Bagge and Peer √Östrom. Dramatically different from the released album version. Leaked onto the internet in April 2008. * \\"History (Land of The Free)\\" Completely different version from the song released as the B-side to Jump. Madonna's voice is more pure, and the song has a completely different structure. Two different demos with slightly different lyrics leaked, the first in 2007 and the second in April 2008. * \\"Keep the Trance\\" A collaboration with Mirwais that was not used for the album. A short edit of this track that was recorded during the album sessions, leaked onto the internet in January 2008. An alternate mix (reportedly final) leaked in August 2008. The lyrics were eventually reworked and used for the Live Earth charity release \\"Hey You\\", which has very similar lyrics. The instrumental track was later reworked and used for the song \\"Get It Right\\" by Yas, taken from her album Arabology, which was also produced by Mirwais. * \\"(title uncertain)\\" Brother-in-law Joe Henry mentioned in an interview that he was working with Madonna on two songs. Only one of these collaborations (Jump), appeared on the final cut of the album. The second song may have been \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" which Madonna developed with Henry in 2005 before re-working it with other writers for inclusion on her 2008 album Hard Candy. * \\"Triggering\\" Another collaboration between Madonna and Mirwais. The song leaked in full on August 21, 2008. Sometimes referred to by fans as \\"Triggering Your Senses\\" due to the song's chorus. Registered ASCAP Work ID# 502697032 = Hard Candy = * \\"Across the Sky\\", a reported collaboration with Justin Timberlake, Danja and Timbaland. An edited nine-second low-quality a capella clip was leaked onto the internet in 2009; the full song leaked on January 21, 2010. An earlier version leaked on September 5, 2010. Justin Timberlake sings on the chorus of both demos. * \\"Animal\\" is another Timbaland outtake. The full song leaked onto the internet on September 6, 2010. Some of the lyrics are as follows; \\"There's no use goin' back 'cos the damage is done. Throw away...\\" * \\"Beat Goes On (Demo)\\", an early version leaked onto the internet in August 2007 titled as \\"The Beat Goes On\\". It features significantly different lyrics and musical structure from the album version. The song was completely reworked after this demo leaked, and another demo with Pharrell Williams titled \\"Silly Girl\\" was supposedly incorporated into the final album version of \\"Beat Goes On\\". The Kanye West rap present in the released version was recorded after this demo leaked. The original instrumental was reworked and given to rapper Busta Rhymes, it appears as \\"G Stro\\" on the Fast & Furious soundtrack. * \\"Infinity\\", an early version of \\"Give It 2 Me\\". The full song leaked onto the internet on September 3, 2010. It features similar lyrics, but the musical structure is completely different compared to the released version. It has been suggested that this early recording was produced by Timbaland and Timberlake, and that an alternate version with added elements also exists. * \\"Latte a.k.a. Pala Tute\\" (aka \\"Lela Pala Tute\\", translation: The Madness of Love), a collaboration with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland and Danja. The full demo leaked onto the internet on September 7, 2010 as the incorrect title \\"Latte\\". Timbaland mentioned the song during an interview with MTV, then calling it \\"La La\\". He has also been heard describing the song as \\"Coffee Song\\". The chorus is sung in Romani and incorporates lyrics from the song \\"Pala Tute\\" by Gogol Bordello. It has been said that Timbaland misunderstood the lyrics of the chorus, erroneously assuming that it was about coffee. A final version of the song exists, with slightly different instrumentation and additional vocals by Justin Timberlake. Madonna incorporated some parts of \\"Pala Tute\\" into \\"La Isla Bonita\\" during her Live Earth performance and again on her Sticky & Sweet Tour in 2008/2009. Most file-sharing sites, lyric websites, and her fans still refer to the song as \\"Latte\\" instead of its correct title. * \\"The Beat Is So Crazy\\", a reported collaboration with Eve and produced by Pharrell Williams. The song was originally recorded with Pharrell for Hard Candy, but was given to Eve when it didn't make the cut. Then, the song was supposed to be included on Eve's \\"Here I Am\\" album, slated to drop in 2007, but was never released due to creative differences with her label at the time, Interscope Records (what has become current Madonna label later). Eve sings the verses, and Madonna joins her on the hook: \\"The beat is so crazy / It makes me want to let go / And totally forget today / I'm better off anyway,\\". In addition, Pharrell makes a brief vocal cameo at the latter part of the song. The version recorded for Eve's album leaked on August 16, 2014. The original version of the song leaked in August 2015. = Celebration = * \\"Broken\\", was mentioned by Paul Oakenfold,Pauloakenfold.com interview . another track recorded for the compilation. Lyrics include, \\"Broken like a crooked smile, a little hunched over...\\". Parts of the lyrics were taken from the previously released song \\"Miles Away\\". The full song leaked onto the internet on September 6, 2010. Clips of the original acoustic demo of \\"Broken\\", possibly recorded in 2007, leaked on April 19, 2011. The full acoustic demo leaked two days later. On August 25, 2011, it was announced on Madonna's official website that fans who active Platinum members or renewed their membership of Madonna's official fanclub, ICON, in 2010, would receive a limited edition 12\\" vinyl single of the song, including the Original Extended Mix and the Instrumental Version. The vinyl has later appeared in the official Madonna online store as available for redemption only by qualified 2010 Madonna Platinum ICON members who received a redemption coupon code. * \\"It's So Cool\\" is a song originally written with Mirwais and Monte Pittman, CMRRA registration# 1852456 (see above). A remixed version by Paul Oakenfold appears as an iTunes-only bonus track on Madonna's greatest hits compilation Celebration. In an interview for the June 2009 T√™tu Magazine, Mirwais stated that: \\"We still have some tracks we're supposed to do together. Especially one that I really like, a very folkish song, but her last album (Hard Candy) had a more R&B; sound.\\" It is suspected he was in fact talking about the demo \\"Cool Song\\". Mirwais was commissioned to rework this track initially recorded with Madonna for the American Life album. For the Celebration album, Madonna chose to use Oakenfold's version; however, Mirwais' 2002 and 2009 versions leaked onto the internet in full on August 31, 2010.  2010‚Äì19  = MDNA = * \\"Bang Bang Boom\\" Original \\"Mika-version\\" demo, later reworked for the song \\"Gang Bang\\". The song contains some of the same lyrics but the composition is completely different from the album version released on MDNA. The lyrical structure of the song is somewhat altered, however, the intonation of the vocals is very different. The song leaked in full via the internet on May 14, 2012. The Priscilla Renea songwriter's demo, sung entirely by Renea herself, also leaked to the Internet some time in 2012/13. = Rebel Heart = * Thirteen demos from the album had leaked online by the night of December 16, 2014, before a title or release date had been announced. Along with the leak came false rumors of possible album titles, Iconic and Unapologetic Bitch. Snippets of the demos for \\"Rebel Heart\\" and \\"Wash All Over Me\\" leaked prior to this date some time in late November of the same year. Before the mass leak of demos, the songs \\"Joan of Arc\\", \\"Rebel Heart\\", \\"Wash All Over Me\\", and \\"Two Steps Behind Me\\" had been confirmed to have been recorded for the album by August 2014. Madonna revealed through social media that half of the leaked demos won't be released on the final version of the album, and \\"the other half have changed [or] evolved\\". Fourteen further demos were leaked to the internet on December 23, including \\"Back That Up (Do It)\\", which was eventually reworked and included as a bonus track on her 2019 album Madame X. Over the following day, three more demos leaked, including alternate acoustic takes of \\"Rebel Heart\\" and \\"Wash All Over Me\\". \\"Arioso\\", a demo from Ray of Light,https://twitter.com/WilliamOrbit/status/548997576595226626?lang=en leaked on December 25 amidst this mass leak of materials. On December 27 two more songs were leaked online, including the long-rumored \\"Two Steps Behind Me\\", which is reported to be a Lady Gaga diss track, though the claim has been denied by both Madonna and her management.

Effeminacy is the manifestation of traits in a boy or man that are more often associated with feminine behavior, mannerism, style, or gender roles rather than with masculine behavior, mannerisms, style or roles. It is typically used implying criticism or ridicule of this behavior (as opposed to merely describing a man as feminine). The terms effeminate is most often used by people who subscribe to the widespread view that males should display traditionally masculine traits and behaviors. Certain groups, however, have reclaimed the term and its related words for self-identification. History =Terminology= Effeminate comes from Latin effeminƒÅtus, from the factitive prefix ex- (from ex 'out') and femina 'woman'; it means 'made feminine, emasculated, weakened'. Another Latin term is mollities, meaning 'softness'. In ancient Koine Greek, the word for effeminate is Œ∫ŒØŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒøœÇ kinaidos (cinaedus in its Latinized form), or ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒØ malakoi: a man \\"whose most salient feature was a supposedly \\"feminine\\" love of being sexually penetrated by other men\\".Winkler, 1990 \\"A cinaedus is a man who cross-dresses or flirts like a girl. Indeed, the word's etymology suggests an indirect sexual act emanating a promiscuous woman. This term has been borrowed from the Greek kinaidos (which may itself have come from a language of Ionian Greecs of Asia Minor, primarily signifying a purely effeminate dancer who entertained his audiences with a tympanum or tambourine in his hand, and adopted a lascivious style, often suggestively wiggling his buttocks in such a way as to suggest anal intercourse....The primary meaning of cinaedus never died out; the term never became a dead metaphor.\\"Williams, 1999 Other vernacular words for effeminacy include: pansy, nelly, pretty boy, nancy boy, girly boy, molly, sissy, pussy, tomgirl, femboy, and girl (when applied to a boy or, especially, adult man). Conversely, a masculine girl or woman would be called a tomboy, butch, or dyke. The word effete similarly means effeminacy or over-refinement, but comes from the Latin effetus 'having given birth; exhausted', from ex- and fetus 'offspring'. The term tomgirl, meaning a girlish boy, comes from an inversion of tomboy, meaning a boyish girl. =Ancient Greece and Rome= Greece Greek historian Plutarch recounts that Periander, the tyrant of Ambracia, asked his \\"boy\\", \\"Aren't you pregnant yet?\\" in the presence of other people, causing the boy to kill him in revenge for being treated as if effeminate or a woman (Amatorius 768F). As part of Greek politician's (Aeschines') proof that a member of the prosecution against him, Timarchus, had prostituted himself to (or been \\"kept\\" by) another man while young, he attributed fellow prosecutor Demosthenes' nickname Batalos (\\"arse\\") to his \\"unmanliness and kinaidiƒÅ\\" and frequently commented on his \\"unmanly and womanish temper\\", even criticising his clothing: \\"If anyone took those dainty little coats and soft shirts off you... and took them round for the jurors to handle, I think they'd be quite unable to say, if they hadn't been told in advance, whether they had hold of a man's clothing or a woman's.\\"Dover, 1989 Demosthenes is also implicated in passive homosexuality and the prostitution of youth:Aiskhines iii 162 \\"There is a certain Aristion, a Plataean..., who as a youth was outstandingly good- looking and lived for a long time in Demosthenes' house. Allegations about the part he was playing [lit., 'undergoing or doing what'] there vary, and it would be most unseemly for me to talk about it.\\" The late Greek Er√¥tes (\\"Loves\\", \\"Forms of Desire\\", \\"Affairs of the Heart\\"), preserved with manuscripts by Lucian, contains a debate \\"between two men, Charicles and Callicratidas, over the relative merits of women and boys as vehicles of male sexual pleasure.\\" Callicratidas, \\"far from being effeminised by his sexual predilection for boys... Callicratidas's inclination renders him hypervirile... Callicratidas's sexual desire for boys, then, makes him more of a man; it does not weaken or subvert his male gender identity but rather consolidates it.\\" In contrast, \\"Charicles' erotic preference for women seems to have had the corresponding effect of effeminising him: when the reader first encounters him, for example, Charicles is described as exhibiting 'a skillful use of cosmetics, so as to be attractive to women.'\\" Rome Over-refinement, fine clothes and other possessions, the company of women, certain trades, and too much fondness with women were all deemed effeminate traits in Roman society. Taking an inappropriate sexual position, passive or \\"bottom\\", in same-gender sex was considered effeminate and unnatural. Touching the head with a finger and wearing a goatee were also considered effeminate.Holland, 2004 Roman consul Scipio Aemilianus questioned one of his opponents, P. Sulpicius Galus: \\"For the kind of man who adorns himself daily in front of a mirror, wearing perfume; whose eyebrows are shaved off; who walks around with plucked beard and thighs; who when he was a young man reclined at banquets next to his lover, wearing a long-sleeved tunic; who is fond of men as he is of wine: can anyone doubt that he has done what cinaedi are in the habit of doing?\\"fr. 17 Malcovati; Aulus Gellius, 6.12.5; cited/translated by Williams 1999, p. 23 Roman orator Quintilian described, \\"The plucked body, the broken walk, the female attire,\\" as \\"signs of one who is soft [mollis] and not a real man.\\"Institutes 5.9.14, cited/translated by Richlin, 1993 For Roman men masculinity also meant self-control, even in the face of painful emotions, illnesses, or death. Cicero says, \\"There exist certain precepts, even laws, that prohibit a man from being effeminate in pain,\\"Fin. 2.94 and Seneca adds, \\"If I must suffer illness, it will be my wish to do nothing out of control, nothing effeminately.\\"Epist. 67.4 Emperor/philosopher Julian the Apostate, in his Against the Galileans, wrote: Why the Egyptians are more intelligent and more given to crafts, and the Syrians unwarlike and effeminate, but at the same time intelligent, hot- tempered, vain and quick to learn? In his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar wrote that the Belgians were the bravest of all Gauls because \\"merchants least frequently resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind\\".Commentarii de Bello Gallico, I,1 Emperor Marcus Aurelius evidently considered effeminacy an undesirable trait, but it is unclear as to what or who was being referred.Meditations, Book 4. =The Bible= Malakos is listed among other vices in the New Testament book of I Corinthians 6:9. Translations use different terms to express this. The online Greek Interlinear Bible uses Strongs concordance (last corrected in 2008) translates Malakoi as \\"Catamites\\", and Arsenokoitia as \\"sodomites\\".Martin, 1996 The word malakos, #3120 in the Greek Dictionary of The New Testament of James Strong's Exhaustive Concordance to The Bible states: \\"of uncertain affinity\\". Possible biological causes of effeminacy in men = The effects of chemicals = One of the more demonstrable causes of effeminacy in men is the effect of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) especially during the gestation period and early childhood. EDCs interfere with or disrupt the proper functioning of human hormones. One of the major classes of chemicals that are cited as contributing to male feminisation consists of certain plasticisers, notably phthalates. In 2009, Shanna Swan (professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Rochester) and her colleagues published a study on the effect of the phthalates DEHP and DBP on expectant mothers and their unborn children. It shows that the boys born from mothers with the highest concentration of these two chemicals were five times less likely to show behaviour typically associated with young males of similar age: 'If the mother's MEHHP concentration [one of the phthalate metabolites] was high, in the upper quartile, the odds that her boy had a score that was less masculine [in play behavior] was five times greater than mothers whose MEHHP was in the lowest quartile.\\" A possible link to sexual orientation is yet to be established. In addition, certain plants can produce chemical compounds that have a similar effect as human oestrogens, hence the term \\"phytoestrogen \\", thanks to their structural similarity with estradiol (17-Œ≤-estradiol). Vegetable foods with the highest relative phytoestrogen content are nuts and oilseeds, followed by soy products, cereals and breads, legumes. It has often been assumed that the frequent ingestion of such phyoestrogens contributes to male feminisation (including the condition of Gynecomastia) or the disruption of male reproductivity. It is unclear however under which conditions this may occur (and to which extent), i.e. whether it depends on the daily dose, the age (of the male consumer) or even genetic disposition. A 2010 meta-analysis of fifteen placebo-controlled studies said that \\"neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone concentrations in [adult] men.\\" Gay men In the United States, boys are often homosocial,Gagnon, 1977 and gender role performance determines social rank.David and Brannon, 1976 While gay boys receive the same enculturation, they are less compliant. Martin Levine summarizes: \\"Harry (1982, 51‚Äì52), for example, found that 42 percent of his gay respondents were 'sissies' during childhood. Only 11 percent of his heterosexual samples were gender-role nonconformists. Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith (1981, 188) reported that half of their male homosexual subjects practised gender-inappropriate behaviour in childhood. Among their heterosexual men, the rate of noncompliance was 25 percent. Saghir and Robins (1973, 18) found that one-third of their gay man respondents conformed to gender role dictates. Only 3 percent of their heterosexual men deviated from the norm.\\" Thus effeminate boys, or sissies, are physically and verbally harassed (Saghir and Robins, 1973, 17‚Äì18; Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith 1981, 74‚Äì84), causing them to feel worthlessHarry 1982, 20 and \\"de-feminise\\".Saghir and Robins 1973, 18‚Äì19Levine, 1998, p. 5‚Äì16 Prior to the Stonewall riots, inconsistent gender role performance had been noticed among gay men:Karlen, 1978Cory and LeRoy, 1963Newton, 1972 \\"They have a different face for different occasions. In conversations with each other, they often undergo a subtle change. I have seen men who appeared to be normal suddenly smile roguishly, soften their voices, and simper as they greeted homosexual friends [...] Many times I saw these changes occur after I had gained a homosexual's confidence and he could safely risk my disapproval. Once as I watched a luncheon companion become an effeminate caricature of himself, he apologised, 'It is hard to always remember that one is a man.'\\"Stearn 1962, 29Levine, 1998, p. 21‚Äì23 Pre-Stonewall \\"closet\\" culture accepted homosexuality as effeminate behaviour, and thus emphasized camp, drag, and swish including an interest in fashionHenry, 1955West, 1977 and decorating.Fischer 1972White 1980Henry 1955, 304 Masculine gay men were marginalisedWarren 1972, 1974Helmer 1963 and formed their own communities, such as the leather subculture and Western,Goldstein, 1975 and/or wore clothes that were commonly associated with working-class individuals,Fischer, 1972 such as sailor uniforms.Levine, 1998, p. 21‚Äì23, 56 Post-Stonewall, \\"clone culture\\" became dominant and effeminacy is now marginalised. One indicator of this is a definite preference shown in personal ads for masculine-behaving men.Bailey et al. 1997. The avoidance of effeminacy by men, including gay ones, has been linked to possible impedance of personal and public health. Regarding HIV/AIDS, masculine behaviour was stereotyped as being unconcerned about safe sex practices while engaging in promiscuous sexual behaviour. Early reports from New York City indicated that more women had themselves tested for HIV/AIDS than men.Sullivan, 1987Levine, 1998, p. 148 David Halperin compares \\"universalising\\" and \\"minoritising\\" notions of gender deviance: \\"'Softness' either may represent the specter of potential gender failure that haunts all normative masculinity, an ever- present threat to the masculinity of every man, or it may represent the disfiguring peculiarity of a small class of deviant individuals.\\"David Halperin, 2002 The term effeminiphobia (sometimes effemiphobic, as used by Randy P. Conner) was coined by Will Fellows to describe strong anti- effeminacy. Michael Bailey coined the similar term femiphobia to describe the ambivalence gay men and culture have about effeminate behaviour in 1995.Michael Bailey, 1995 Gay author Tim Bergling popularized the term sissyphobia in Sissyphobia: Gay Men and Effeminate Behavior,Dylan Vox, \\"Would Life Be Better if You Were Straight?\\", Gaywired.com, Dec 20, 2007, also appeared in Edge, Boston although it was used before. Transsexual writer and biologist Julia Serano has coined the similar term effemimania. Feminist Sociologist Rhea Ashley Hoskin suggests that these terms can be understood as relating to a larger construct of femmephobia, or \\"prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone who is perceived to identify, embody, or express femininely and toward people and objects gendered femininely.\\" Since the 2000s, Peter Hennen's cultural analysis of gay masculinities has found effeminacy to be a ‚Äúhistorically varying concept deployed primarily as a means of stabilising a given society‚Äôs concept of masculinity and controlling the conduct of its men based upon the repudiation of the feminine‚Äù.

He joined Fox News in January 2011. Prior to Fox News, Roberts was at CNN where he was an anchor and Senior National Correspondent. He worked at various radio and television jobs before joining CTV in 1990, CBS News in 1992 and CNN in 2006. On March 12, 2009, Roberts was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame. Prior to becoming their chief White House correspondent, Roberts was a national correspondent for Fox News, based in Atlanta. Early life Roberts was born in Toronto, Ontario and grew up in Mississauga, Ontario. He attended Erindale Secondary School and Lorne Park Secondary School and later the University of Toronto's Erindale College. Career =Local radio= Roberts first started working in radio at the local college station, CFRE-FM in Mississauga. His first professional job was as reporter and news anchor with CFOS in Owen Sound, Ontario in 1975. From there, he went to CHYM in Kitchener, where he worked as a newsman and DJ, then worked on-air for radio station CJBK in London, Ontario in 1977, before moving back to Toronto to join top-40 powerhouse CHUM later that year as a weekday evening disc jockey. 1050 CHUM and CITY-TV gave him the on-air name J.D. Roberts. =CITY-TV and MuchMusic= In 1979, he branched out from his radio work to co-host with Jeanne Beker the music newsmagazine The NewMusic on CITY- TV until 1985. The New Music was a pioneering program that pre-dated MTV. Roberts, Beker and the New Music team won many awards for their work. During that time, Roberts also served as Entertainment reporter for CITY-TV and on occasion filled in for John Majhor and later Brad Giffen on CITY-TV's local music video show Toronto Rocks. In 1984, Roberts was tapped to front Canada's music channel MuchMusic. He and Christopher Ward were the first on-air personalities appearing when the network launched in 1984. At MuchMusic he hosted many programs, including a one-hour heavy metal video show called The Power Hour. In 1987, Roberts left MuchMusic to anchor CITY-TV's CityPulse, and became anchor of the 10 pm CityPulse Tonight when Anne Mroczkowski moved from anchoring that newscast to join Gord Martineau on the 6 pm edition. =WCIX= Between 1989 and 1990 Roberts was an anchor/reporter for WCIX (now WFOR-TV), the CBS-owned and operated television station in Miami, Florida. =CTV= Roberts returned to Canada in September 1990 to co-host the national CTV morning show Canada AM, initially with Deborah McGregor, and later with Pamela Wallin. =CBS= In 1992, Roberts moved to CBS News in New York. His initial assignment was anchoring the CBS Morning News with co-anchor Meredith Vieira. Roberts was also the news reader and substitute anchor for Harry Smith on CBS This Morning and The Early Show. From 1994 to 1995 Roberts anchored the 5pm and 11pm newscasts at CBS's flagship station in New York, WCBS-TV. In March 1995, he moved back to the CBS Network as anchor of the CBS Sunday Evening News, remaining in that position for nearly 11 years. He also anchored the CBS Saturday Evening News from February 1999 until he became CBS chief White House Correspondent in August 1999. Roberts served as chief White House Correspondent at CBS from August 1999 to February 2006, and regularly anchored a Sunday-afternoon 3pm ET newscast for the CBS Radio Network. In March 2003, Roberts was embedded with the 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion of the U.S. Marines during the initial invasion of Iraq. On July 19, 2005, he introduced CBS's coverage on the announcement of the nomination of John Roberts for the Supreme Court of the United States. He jokingly asked colleagues to refer to him as \\"Your Honor\\" because he and Justice Roberts bear the same name. He had been widely considered a potential replacement for CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather after Rather stepped down from the anchor desk in March 2005, but Bob Schieffer was chosen on an interim basis to be the next CBS Evening News anchor, and in subsequent months, it became clear that Roberts was not under consideration for the job.. During his time at CBS, Roberts received three national Emmy awards as well as a Gracie award for his coverage of a groundbreaking surgery to repair neural tube defects. =CNN= In February 2006, Roberts left CBS and joined CNN. In July 2006 and August 2006, Roberts reported from the front lines in the Israel/Hezbollah war and at one point, embedded with an Israeli infantry unit, marching 10 miles into Lebanon. Roberts was recognized with a Headline Award for that embed. CNN's coverage of the war was recognized with an Edward R. Murrow Award. In October 2006, he returned to Iraq as the first anchor of This Week at War and served as the Senior National Correspondent based in Washington. He has also substituted for Anderson Cooper on Anderson Cooper 360¬∞. Roberts was co-anchor of CNN's morning program American Morning from 2007 to 2010. He anchored from New York. In 2010, American Morning was nominated for \\"best morning program\\" at the Daytime Emmy Awards, losing to Good Morning America. The New York Post reported on December 7, 2010, that Roberts would depart American Morning and become a national correspondent based out of CNN's headquarters in Atlanta. The Associated Press reported that Roberts' departure was at his request so he could move closer to fianc√©e and CNN anchor Kyra Phillips. =Fox News= Executives at CNN confirmed on January 3, 2011, that Roberts would be leaving CNN to join Fox News as a national correspondent, based in Atlanta. In an August 2016 sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News, Andrea Tantaros claimed that Roberts, Scott Brown, and Bill O'Reilly sexually harassed her. The case was dismissed. In January 2017, Roberts became chief White House correspondent for Fox News. Personal life Divorced in 2008, John Roberts announced his engagement to Kyra Phillips on April 25, 2010.TV Newser They have twin children named Sage Ann and Kellan Clay.

The applications of scintigraphy include early drug development and nuclear medical imaging to view and analyse images of the human body or the distribution of medically injected, inhaled, or ingested radionuclides emitting gamma rays. Imaging techniques Coded aperture mask for gamma camera (for SPECT) Scintigraphy (\\"scint\\") is the use of gamma cameras to capture emitted radiation from internal radioisotopes to create two- dimensionalthefreedictionary.com > scintigraphy Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers, 2007 by Saunders; Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. 2007; McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine, 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies images. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging, as used in nuclear cardiac stress testing, is performed using gamma cameras. Usually one, two or three detectors or heads, are slowly rotated around the patient's torso. Multi-headed gamma cameras can also be used for positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, provided that their hardware and software can be configured to detect \\"coincidences\\" (near simultaneous events on 2 different heads). Gamma camera PET is markedly inferior to PET imaging with a purpose designed PET scanner, as the scintillator crystal has poor sensitivity for the high-energy annihilation photons, and the detector area is significantly smaller. However, given the low cost of a gamma camera and its additional flexibility compared to a dedicated PET scanner, this technique is useful where the expense and resource implications of a PET scanner cannot be justified. Construction Gamma camera Diagrammatic cross section of a gamma camera detector Details of the cross section of a gamma camera A gamma camera consists of one or more flat crystal planes (or detectors) optically coupled to an array of photomultiplier tubes in an assembly known as a \\"head\\", mounted on a gantry. The gantry is connected to a computer system that both controls the operation of the camera and acquires and stores images. The construction of a gamma camera is sometimes known as a compartmental radiation construction. The system accumulates events, or counts, of gamma photons that are absorbed by the crystal in the camera. Usually a large flat crystal of sodium iodide with thallium doping in a light-sealed housing is used. The highly efficient capture method of this combination for detecting gamma rays was discovered in 1944 by Sir Samuel Curran\\"Counting tubes, theory and applications\\", Curran, Samuel C., Academic Press (New York), 1949 whilst he was working on the Manhattan Project at the University of California at Berkeley. Nobel prize- winning physicist Robert Hofstadter also worked on the technique in 1948. The crystal scintillates in response to incident gamma radiation. When a gamma photon leaves the patient (who has been injected with a radioactive pharmaceutical), it knocks an electron loose from an iodine atom in the crystal, and a faint flash of light is produced when the dislocated electron again finds a minimal energy state. The initial phenomenon of the excited electron is similar to the photoelectric effect and (particularly with gamma rays) the Compton effect. After the flash of light is produced, it is detected. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) behind the crystal detect the fluorescent flashes (events) and a computer sums the counts. The computer reconstructs and displays a two dimensional image of the relative spatial count density on a monitor. This reconstructed image reflects the distribution and relative concentration of radioactive tracer elements present in the organs and tissues imaged. Animated schematic of gamma-camera physics and main constituents Signal processing Hal Anger developed the first gamma camera in 1957. His original design, frequently called the Anger camera, is still widely used today. The Anger camera uses sets of vacuum tube photomultipliers (PMT). Generally each tube has an exposed face of about in diameter and the tubes are arranged in hexagon configurations, behind the absorbing crystal. The electronic circuit connecting the photodetectors is wired so as to reflect the relative coincidence of light fluorescence as sensed by the members of the hexagon detector array. All the PMTs simultaneously detect the (presumed) same flash of light to varying degrees, depending on their position from the actual individual event. Thus the spatial location of each single flash of fluorescence is reflected as a pattern of voltages within the interconnecting circuit array. The location of the interaction between the gamma ray and the crystal can be determined by processing the voltage signals from the photomultipliers; in simple terms, the location can be found by weighting the position of each photomultiplier tube by the strength of its signal, and then calculating a mean position from the weighted positions. The total sum of the voltages from each photomultiplier, measured by a pulse height analyzer is proportional to the energy of the gamma ray interaction, thus allowing discrimination between different isotopes or between scattered and direct photons. Spatial resolution In order to obtain spatial information about the gamma-ray emissions from an imaging subject (e.g. a person's heart muscle cells which have absorbed an intravenous injected radioactive, usually thallium-201 or technetium-99m, medicinal imaging agent) a method of correlating the detected photons with their point of origin is required. The conventional method is to place a collimator over the detection crystal/PMT array. The collimator consists of a thick sheet of lead, typically thick, with thousands of adjacent holes through it. The individual holes limit photons which can be detected by the crystal to a cone; the point of the cone is at the midline center of any given hole and extends from the collimator surface outward. However, the collimator is also one of the sources of blurring within the image; lead does not totally attenuate incident gamma photons, there can be some crosstalk between holes. Unlike a lens, as used in visible light cameras, the collimator attenuates most (>99%) of incident photons and thus greatly limits the sensitivity of the camera system. Large amounts of radiation must be present so as to provide enough exposure for the camera system to detect sufficient scintillation dots to form a picture. Other methods of image localization (pinhole, rotating slat collimator with CZT) have been proposed and tested; however, none have entered widespread routine clinical use. The best current camera system designs can differentiate two separate point sources of gamma photons located at 6 to 12 mm depending on distance from the collimator, the type of collimator and radio-nucleide. Spatial resolution decreases rapidly at increasing distances from the camera face. This limits the spatial accuracy of the computer image: it is a fuzzy image made up of many dots of detected but not precisely located scintillation. This is a major limitation for heart muscle imaging systems; the thickest normal heart muscle in the left ventricle is about 1.2 cm and most of the left ventricle muscle is about 0.8 cm, always moving and much of it beyond 5 cm from the collimator face. To help compensate, better imaging systems limit scintillation counting to a portion of the heart contraction cycle, called gating, however this further limits system sensitivity.

In the field of psychology and psychotherapy, it is a skill that can be learned and a mode of communication. Dorland's Medical Dictionary defines assertiveness as: :a form of behavior characterized by a confident declaration or affirmation of a statement without need of proof; this affirms the person's rights or point of view without either aggressively threatening the rights of another (assuming a position of dominance) or submissively permitting another to ignore or deny one's rights or point of view.\\"assertiveness\\" in Dorland's Medical Dictionary It is considered a critical life skill and recommended for children to develop. While not currently taught in schools, assertiveness is a communication skill that can be taught and the skills of assertive communication effectively learned. Assertiveness is a method of critical thinking where an individual speaks up in defense of their views or in light of erroneous information. Assertive people are able to be outspoken and analyse information and point out areas of information lacking substance, details or evidence. Assertiveness supports creative thinking and effective communication. The level of assertiveness demonstrated in any human community is a factor of social and cultural practices at the time of inquiry. For example, in 2019 there are global public discussions about controversial topics such as drug addiction, rape and sexual abuse of women and children, which were not openly discussed in 1940. Within families, children are not always encouraged to develop assertiveness skills and must usually accept and obey rulings by their parents. Today, however, outspoken children can legally input to decisions about their lives from the age of sixteen. During the second half of the 20th century, assertiveness was increasingly singled out as a behavioral skill taught by many personal development experts, behavior therapists, and cognitive behavioral therapists. Assertiveness is often linked to self-esteem. The term and concept was popularized to the general public by books such as Your Perfect Right: A Guide to Assertive Behavior (1970) by Robert E. Alberti and Michael L. Emmons and When I Say No, I Feel Guilty: How To Cope Using the Skills of Systematic Assertiveness Therapy (1975) by Manuel J. Smith. Training Joseph Wolpe originally explored the use of assertiveness as a means of \\"reciprocal inhibition\\" of anxiety, in his 1958 book on treating neurosis; and it has since been commonly employed as an intervention in behavior therapy.Wolpe, J. (1958) Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition, (California: Stanford University Press, 1958), 53‚Äì62 Assertiveness Training (\\"AT\\") was introduced by Andrew Salter (1961) and popularized by Joseph Wolpe.W.

Nemeroff eds., The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science: Volume I (2002) p. 142 Wolpe's belief was that a person could not be both assertive and anxious at the same time, and thus being assertive would inhibit anxiety. The goals of assertiveness training include:Craighead/Nemeroff eds., p. 142 * increased awareness of personal rights * differentiation between non-assertiveness and assertiveness * differentiation between passive‚Äìaggressiveness and aggressiveness * learning both verbal and non-verbal assertiveness skills. As a communication style and strategy, assertiveness is thus distinguished from both aggression and passivity. How people deal with personal boundaries, their own and those of other people, helps to distinguish between these three concepts. Passive communicators do not defend their own personal boundaries and thus allow aggressive people to abuse or manipulate them through fear. Passive communicators are also typically not likely to risk trying to influence anyone else. Aggressive people do not respect the personal boundaries of others and thus are liable to harm others while trying to influence them. A person communicates assertively by overcoming fear of speaking his or her mind or trying to influence others, but doing so in a way that respects the personal boundaries of others. Assertive people are also willing to defend themselves against aggressive people. Communication Assertive communication involves respect for the boundaries of oneself and others. It also presumes an interest in the fulfillment of needs and wants through cooperation.Driven by Research on hundreds of families: The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work; by John Gottman, PhD, Randomhouse, May 16, 2000; coined the \\"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\\", four patterns of communicating which end including criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling According to the textbook Cognitive Behavior Therapy (2008), \\"Assertive communication of personal opinions, needs, and boundaries has been ... conceptualized as the behavioral middle ground, lying between ineffective passive and aggressive responses\\".William T. O'Donohue/Jane E. Fisher eds., Cognitive Behavior Therapy (2008) Such communication \\"emphasizes expressing feelings forthrightly, but in a way that will not spiral into aggression\\".Daniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (London 1996) p. 266 If others' actions threaten one's boundaries, one communicates this to prevent escalation.Facing Co-dependence: What It Is, Where It Comes from, How It Sabotages Our Lives by Pia Mellody, Andrea Wells Miller, and J. Keith Miller In contrast, \\"aggressive communication\\" judges, threatens, lies, breaks confidences, stonewalls, and violates others' boundaries. At the opposite end of the dialectic is \\"passive communication\\". Victims may passively permit others to violate their boundaries. At a later time, they may come back and attack with a sense of impunity or righteous indignation. Assertive communication attempts to transcend these extremes by appealing to the shared interest of all parties; it \\"focuses on the issue, not the person\\".Paul Gilbert, Overcoming Depression (London 1998) p. 219 Aggressive and/or passive communication, on the other hand, may mark a relationship's end,from DBT as researched by Marsha M. Linehan, Professor, Department of Psychology, Director, Behavioral Research & Therapy Clinics at the University of Washington and reduce self-respect. Characteristics Assertive people tend to have the following characteristics: * They feel free to express their feelings, thoughts, and desires. * They are \\"also able to initiate and maintain comfortable relationships with [other] people\\"Henry Virkler, Speaking the Truth with Love (2009) p. 48 * They know their rights. * They have control over their anger. This does not mean that they repress this feeling; it means that they control anger and talk about it in a reasoning manner. * \\"Assertive people ... are willing to compromise with others, rather than always wanting their own way ... and tend to have good self-esteem\\".Marie Reid/Richard Hammersley, Communicating Successfully in Groups (Psychology Press, 2000) p. 49 * \\"Assertive people enter friendships from an 'I count my needs. I count your needs' position\\".Virkler, p. 74 Techniques Techniques of assertiveness can vary widely. Manuel Smith, in his 1975 book When I Say No, I Feel Guilty, offered some of the following behaviors: =Broken record= The \\"broken record\\" techniqueSmith, M.J. When I say no, I feel guilty 1975 consists of simply repeating your requests or your refusals every time you are met with resistance. The term comes from vinyl records, the surface of which when scratched would lead the needle of a record player to loop over the same few seconds of the recording indefinitely. \\"As with a broken record, the key to this approach is repetition ... where your partner will not take no for an answer.\\"Rich Pfeiffer, Relationships: Assertiveness Skills (2010) p. 28 A disadvantage with this technique is that when resistance continues, your requests may lose power every time you have to repeat them. If the requests are repeated too often, it can backfire on the authority of your words. In these cases, it is necessary to have some sanctions on hand. =Fogging= Fogging consists of finding some limited truth to agree with in what an antagonist is saying. More specifically, one can agree in part or agree in principle. =Negative inquiry= Negative inquiry consists of requesting further, more specific criticism. =Negative assertion= Negative assertion is agreement with criticism without letting up demand. =I-statements= I-statements can be used to voice one's feelings and wishes from a personal position without expressing a judgment about the other person or blaming one's feelings on them. Applications Several research studies have identified assertiveness training as a useful tool in the prevention of alcohol-use disorders. Psychological skills in general including assertiveness and social skills have been posed as intervention for a variety of disorders with some empirical support. Pdf. In connection with gender theory, \\"Tannen argues that men and women would both benefit from learning to use the others' style. ... So, women would benefit from assertiveness training just as men might benefit from sensitivity training\\". Criticism Assertiveness may be practiced in an unbalanced way, especially by those new to the process: \\"[One] problem with the concept of assertiveness is that it is both complex and situation-specific. ... Behaviors that are assertive in one circumstance may not be so in another\\".Michael Argyle, Social Situations (Cambridge 1981) p. 50 More particularly, while \\"unassertiveness courts one set of problems, over- assertiveness creates another.\\"Deborah J. Swiss, The Male Mind at Work (2001) p. 20 Assertiveness manuals recognize that \\"many people, when trying out assertive behavior for the first time, find that they go too far and become aggressive.\\"Assert Yourself (A&C; Black Publishers Ltd, London 2009) p. 8 In the late 1970's and early 1980's, in the heyday of assertiveness training, some so-called assertiveness training techniques were distorted and \\"people were told to do some pretty obnoxious things in the name of assertiveness. Like blankly repeating some request over and over until you got your way\\".Mark Mark Eisenstadt, Freedom from Agoraphobia (2003) p. 203 Divorced from respect for the rights of others, so-called assertiveness techniques could be psychological tools that might be readily abused: The line between repeatedly demanding with sanctions (\\"broken record\\") versus coercive nagging, emotional blackmail, or bullying, could be a fine one, and the caricature of assertiveness training as \\"training in how to get your own way ... or how to become as aggressive as the next person\\"Sue Bishop, Develop Your Assertiveness (2006) p. 13 was perpetuated.

The firm is regarded as one of the \\"most secretive and successful\\" hedge funds in the world. Their signature Medallion fund is famed for the best record in investing history. Renaissance was founded in 1982 by James Simons, an award-winning mathematician and former Cold War code breaker. In 1988, the firm established its most profitable portfolio, the Medallion Fund, which used an improved and expanded form of Leonard Baum's mathematical models, improved by algebraist James Ax, to explore correlations from which they could profit. Elwyn Berlekamp was instrumental in evolving trading to shorter-dated, pure systems driven decision-making. The hedge fund was named Medallion in honor of the math awards that Simons and Ax had won. Renaissance's flagship Medallion fund, which is run mostly for fund employees, is famed for the best track record on Wall Street, returning more than 66 percent annualized before fees and 39 percent after fees over a 30-year span from 1988 to 2018. Renaissance offers two portfolios to outside investors‚ÄîRenaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA). Simons ran Renaissance until his retirement in late 2009. The company is now run by Peter Brown (after Robert Mercer resigned). Both of them were computer scientists specializing in computational linguistics who joined Renaissance in 1993 from IBM Research. Simons continues to play a role at the firm as non-executive chairman and remains invested in its funds, particularly the secretive and consistently profitable black-box strategy known as Medallion. Because of the success of Renaissance in general and Medallion in particular, Simons has been described as the best money manager on earth. Academia and research James Simons founded Renaissance Technologies following a decade as the Chair of the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University. Simons in 1976 was a recipient of the Oswald Veblen Prize of the American Mathematical Society, which is geometry's highest honor. He is known in the scientific community for co-developing the Chern‚ÄìSimons theory, which is used in modern theoretical physics. Quantitative trading The firm uses quantitative trading, where staff tap data in its petabyte-scale data warehouse to assess statistical probabilities for the direction of securities prices in any given market. Staff attribute the breadth of data on events peripheral to financial and economic phenomena that Renaissance takes into account, and the firm's ability to manipulate large amounts of data by deploying scalable technological architectures for computation and execution. In many ways, Renaissance Technologies, along with a few other firms, has been synthesizing terabytes of data daily and extracting information signals from petabytes of data for almost two decades now, well before big data and data analytics caught the imagination of mainstream technology. For more than twenty years, the firm's Renaissance Technologies hedge fund has employed mathematical models to analyze and execute trades, many of them automated. The firm uses computer- based models to predict price changes in easily traded financial instruments. These models are based on analyzing as much data as can be gathered, then looking for non-random movements to make predictions. Some also attribute the firm's performance to employing financial signal processing techniques such as pattern recognition. The book The Quants describes the hiring of speech recognition experts, many from IBM, including the current leaders of the firm. \\"Quants\\" with non-financial background Renaissance employs specialists with non-financial backgrounds, including computer scientists, mathematicians, physicists, signal processing experts and statisticians. The firm's latest fund is the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF). RIEF has historically trailed the firm's better-known Medallion fund, a separate fund that contains only the personal money of the firm's executives. In a 2013 article in The Daily Telegraph, journalist Sarfraz Manzoor described Renaissance staff as math geniuses running Wall Street. Renaissance is a firm run by and for scientists, employing preferably those with non-financial backgrounds for quantitative finance research like mathematicians, statisticians, pure and experimental physicists, astronomers, and computer scientists. Wall Street experience is frowned on and a flair for science is prized. It is a widely held belief within Renaissance that the herdlike mentality among business school graduates is to blame for poor investor returns. Renaissance engages roughly 150 researchers and computer programmers, half of whom have PhDs in scientific disciplines, at its 50-acre East Setauket campus in Long Island, New York, which is near the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Mathematician Isadore Singer referred to Renaissance's East Setauket office as the best physics and mathematics department in the world. The firm's administrative and back-office functions are handled from its Manhattan office in New York City. The firm is secretive about the workings of its business and very little is known about them. The firm is known for its ability to recruit and retain scientific types, for having a personnel turnover that is nearly non-existent, and for requiring its researchers to agree to intellectual property obligations by signing non- compete and non-disclosure agreements.  Monemetrics  In 1978 Simons left academia and started a hedge fund management firm called Monemetrics in a Long Island strip mall. The firm primarily traded currencies at the start. It did not occur to Simons at first to apply mathematics to his business, but he gradually realized that it should be possible to make mathematical models of the data he was collecting. Monemetrics‚Äô name was changed to Renaissance Technologies in 1982. Simons started recruiting some of the mathematicians and data-modeling types from his days at the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and Stony Brook University. His first recruit was Leonard Baum, a cryptanalyst from IDA who was also the co-author of the Baum‚ÄìWelch algorithm. When Baum abandoned the idea of trading with mathematical models and took to fundamental trading, Simons brought in algebraist James Ax from Cornell University. Ax expanded Baum's models for trading currencies to cover any commodity future and subsequently Simons set up Ax with his own trading account, Axcom Ltd., which eventually gave birth to the profitable fund ‚Äî Medallion. During the 1980s, Ax and his researchers improved on Baum's models and used them to explore correlations from which they could profit. =Medallion Fund= Medallion outperformed their old pre-2010 401(k) plan and S&P; In 1988 Renaissance established its most famous and profitable portfolio, the Medallion fund, which used an improved and expanded form of Leonard Baum's mathematical models improved by algebraist James Ax to explore correlations from which they could profit. Simons and Ax started a hedge fund and named it Medallion in honor of the math awards that they had won. The mathematical models the company developed worked better and better each year, and by 1988, Simons had decided to base the company's trades entirely on the models. By April 1989, peak-to-trough losses had mounted to about 30%. Ax had accounted for such a drawdown in his models and pushed to keep trading. Simons wanted to stop to research what was going on. After a brief standoff, Simons pulled rank and Ax left. Simons turned to Elwyn Berlekamp to run Medallion from Berkeley, California. A consultant for Axcom whom Simons had first met at the IDA, Berlekamp had bought out most of Ax's stake in Axcom and became its CEO. He worked with Sandor Straus, Jim Simons and another consultant, Henry Laufer, to overhaul Medallion's trading system during a six-month stretch. In 1990, Berlekamp led Medallion to a 55.9% gain, net of fees, and then returned to teaching math at University of California, Berkeley after selling out to Jim Simons at six times the price for which he had bought his Axcom interests 16 months earlier. Straus took the reins of Medallion's revamped trading system and Medallion returned 39.4% in 1991, 34% in 1992 and 39.1% in 1993, according to Medallion annual reports. The Medallion fund is considered to be one of the most successful hedge funds ever. It has averaged a 71.8% annual return, before fees, from 1994 through mid-2014. The fund has been closed to outside investors since 1993 and is available only to current and past employees and their families. The firm bought out the last investor in the Medallion fund in 2005 and the investor community has not seen its returns since then. About 100 of Renaissance's 275 or so employees are what it calls \\"qualified purchasers\\", meaning they generally have at least $5 million in assets to invest. The remaining are \\"accredited investors\\", generally worth at least $1 million. By the year 2000, the computer-driven Medallion fund had made an average of 34% a year after fees since 1988. Simons ran Renaissance until his retirement in late 2009. Between January 1993 and April 2005, Medallion only had 17 monthly losses and out of 49 quarters in the same time period, Medallion only posted three quarterly losses. Between 1989-2005 Medallion had only one year showing a loss: 1989. =Medallion as a retirement fund= Renaissance Technologies terminated its 401(k) retirement plan in 2010 and employees account balances were put into Individual Retirement Accounts. Contributions could be made to a standard Individual Retirement Accounts and then converted to a Roth IRA regardless of income. By 2012 Renaissance was granted a special exemption by the United States Labor Department allowing employees to invest their retirement money in Medallion arguing that Medallion had consistently outperformed their old 401(k) plan. In 2013 Renaissance's IRA plans had 259 participants whose $86.6 million contribution grew to $153 million that year without fees or annual taxes. Renaissance set up a new 401(k) plan and in November 2014 the Labor Department allowed that plan to be invested in Medallion as well. =Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF)= In 2005 Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF) was created. RIEF has historically trailed the firm's better-known Medallion fund, a separate fund that only contains the personal money of the firm's executives. Renaissance also offers two Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA) to outsiders. Simons ran Renaissance until his retirement in late 2009. Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund had difficulty with the higher volatility environment that persisted throughout the end of the summer of 2007. According to an article in Bloomberg in August 2007, On 25 September 2008, Renaissance wrote a comment letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, discouraging them from implementing a rule change that would have permitted the public to access information regarding institutional investors' short positions, as they can currently do with long positions. The company cited a number of reasons for this, including the fact that \\"institutional investors may alter their trading activity to avoid public disclosure\\". Governmental affairs =Tax avoidance investigation 2014= In July 2014 Renaissance Technologies was included in a larger investigation undertaken by Carl Levin and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on tax evasion by wealthy individuals. The focus of the tax avoidance investigation was Renaissance's trading strategy ‚Äî which involved transactions with banks such as Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG ‚Äî through which profits converted from rapid trading were converted into lower-taxed, long-term capital gains. The strategy was also questioned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The higher rates for the five years under investigation would have been 44.4 percent, as compared to 35 percent, whereas the lower rate was 15 percent, as compared to 23.8 percent. =Campaign contributions= According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Renaissance is the top financial firm contributing to federal campaigns in the 2016 election cycle, donating $33,108,000 by July. By comparison, over that same period sixth ranked Soros Fund Management has contributed $13,238,551. Renaissance's managers were also active in the 2016 cycle, contributing nearly $30 million by June, with Mercer ranking as the #1 individual federal donor, largely to Republicans, and Simons ranked #5, largely to Democrats. They were top donors to the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clintonhttps://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contributors?id=N00000019 and Donald Trump. During the 2016 campaign cycle, Simons contributed $26,277,450, ranking as the 5th largest individual contributor. Simons directed all but $25,000 of his funds towards liberal candidates. Robert Mercer contributed $25,059,300, ranking as the 7th largest individual contributor. Robert Mercer directed all funds contributed towards conservative candidates. Since 1990, Renaissance has contributed $59,081,152 to federal campaigns and since 2001 has spent $3,730,000 on lobbying. See also * High-frequency trading * Quote stuffing * Winton Group * D. E.

Over 1,148 trails in all 50 U.S. states, available for public use and ranging from less than a mile to in length, have been designated as NRTs on federal, state, municipal, and privately owned lands. Trails may be nominated for designation as NRTs each year. The NRT online database includes information on most designated trails. National Recreational Trails are part of the National Trails System. Most NRTs are hiking trails, but a significant number are multi-use trails or bike paths. A few are water trails.NRT Paddling and Water Trails The National Park Service (part of the United States Department of the Interior) and the United States Forest Service (part of the United States Department of Agriculture) jointly administer the National Recreation Trails Program with help from a number of other federal and nonprofit partners, notably American Trails, the lead nonprofit for developing and promoting NRTs. The National Trails System Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-543) authorized creation of a national trail system composed of National Recreation Trails and National Scenic Trails. National Historic Trails were added in 1978. While National Scenic Trails and National Historic Trails may only be designated by an act of Congress, National Recreation Trails may be designated by the Secretary of Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture to recognize exemplary trails of local and regional significance in response to an application from the trail's managing agency or organization. Through designation, these trails are recognized as part of America's national system of trails. The National Recreation Trail Program, an independent advocacy organization, supports designated NRTs with an array of benefits, including promotion, technical assistance, a newsletter, email alerts, and networking. Its goal is to promote the use and care of existing trails and stimulate the development of new trails to create a national network of trails and realize the vision of \\"Trails for All Americans.\\" A state-by-state index provide photos and details on featured trails. The first-ever NRT Photo Contest was sponsored in 2003 by American Trails and is continuing each year. A Request for Proposals for art projects on National Recreation Trails was also undertaken.

They appear as a red or blue raised lesion. Typically they begin during the first four weeks of life, grow until about five months of life, and then shrink in size over the next few years. Often skin changes remain following involution. Complications may include pain, bleeding, ulcer formation, heart failure, or disfigurement. The underlying reason for their occurrence is not clear. In about 10% of cases they appear to run in families. A few cases are associated with other abnormalities such as PHACE syndrome. Diagnosis is generally based on the symptoms and appearance. Occasionally medical imaging can assist in the diagnosis. In most cases no treatment is needed, other than close observation. Certain cases, however, may result in problems and the use of medication such as propranolol or steroids are recommended. Occasionally surgery or laser treatment may be used. It is one of the most common benign tumors in babies, occurring in about 5%. They occur more frequently in females, white people, preemies, and low birth weight babies. The word \\"hemangioma\\" comes from the Greek haima (Œ±·º∑ŒºŒ±) meaning \\"blood\\"; angeion (·ºÄŒ≥Œ≥Œµ·øñŒøŒΩ) meaning \\"vessel\\"; and -oma (-œâŒºŒ±) meaning \\"tumor\\". Signs and symptoms A flat hemangioma in a baby A resolving hemangioma Infantile hemangioma, well-circumscribed red, violet, exophytic vascular tumor on the nose of a one-year-old child Infantile hemangiomas typically develop in the first few weeks or months of life. They are more common in Caucasians, in premature children whose birth weight is less than , in females, and in twin births. Early lesions may resemble a red scratch or patch, a white patch, or a bruise. The majority occurs on the head and neck, but they can occur almost anywhere. The appearance and color of the IH depends on its location and depth within the level of the skin. Superficial IHs are situated higher in the skin and have a bright red, erythematous to reddish-purple appearance. Superficial lesions can be flat and telangiectatic, composed of a macule or patch of small, varied branching, capillary blood vessels. They can also be raised and elevated from the skin, forming papules and confluent bright-red plaques like raised islands. Infantile hemangiomas have historically been referred to ‚Äústrawberry hemangiomas‚Äù in the past, as raised superficial hemangiomas can look like the side of a strawberry without seeds. Superficial IHs in certain locations, such as the posterior scalp, neck folds, and groin/perianal areas, are at potential risk of ulceration. Ulcerated hemangiomas can present as black crusted papules or plaques, or painful erosions or ulcers. Ulcerations are prone to secondary bacterial infections, which can present with yellow crusting, drainage, pain, or odor. Ulcerations are also at risk for bleeding, particularly deep lesions or in areas of friction. Multiple superficial hemangiomas, more than five, can be associated with extracutaneous hemangiomas, the most common being a liver (hepatic) hemangioma, and these infants warrant ultrasound examination. Deep IHs present as poorly defined, bluish macules that can proliferate into papules, nodules, or larger tumors. Proliferating lesions are often compressible, but fairly firm. Many deep hemangiomas may have a few superficial capillaries visible evident over the primary deep component or surrounding venous prominence. Deep hemangiomas have a tendency to develop a little later than superficial hemangiomas, and may have longer and later proliferative phases, as well. Deep hemangiomas rarely ulcerate, but can cause issues depending on their location, size, and growth. Deep hemangiomas near sensitive structures can cause compression of softer surrounding structures during the proliferative phase, such as the external ear canal and the eyelid. Mixed hemangiomas are simply a combination of superficial and deep hemangiomas, and may not be evident for several months. Patients may have any combination of superficial, deep, or mixed IHs. IHs are often classified as focal/localized, segmental, or indeterminate. Focal IHs appear localized to a specific location and appear to arise from a solitary spot. Segmental hemangiomas are larger, and appear to encompass a region of the body. Larger or segmental hemangiomas that span a large area can sometimes have underlying anomalies that may require investigation, especially when located on the face, sacrum, or pelvis. Unless ulceration occurs, an IH does not tend to bleed and is not painful. Discomfort may arise if it is bulky and blocks a vital orifice.Oakley, Amanda. \\"Infantile haemangioma.\\". DermNet NZ.

They may break down on the surface, called ulceration, which can be painful and problematic. If the ulceration is deep, significant bleeding and infection may occur in rare occasions. If a hemangioma develops in the larynx, breathing can be compromised. If located near the eye, a growing hemangioma may cause an occlusion or deviation of the eye that can lead to amblyopia.Hunzeker C, Geronemus R (2010). Treatment of Superficial Infantile Hemangiomas of the Eyelid Using the 595-nm Pulsed Dye Laser\\". Dermatol. Surg. 36 (5): 590‚Äì597. Very rarely, extremely large hemangiomas can cause high-output heart failure due to the amount of blood that must be pumped to excess blood vessels. Lesions adjacent to bone may cause erosion of the bone. The most frequent complaints about IHs stem from psychosocial complications. The condition can affect a person's appearance and provoke attention and malicious reactions from others. Particular problems occur if the lip or nose is involved, as distortions can be difficult to treat surgically. The potential for psychological injury develops from school age onward. Considering treatment before school begins is, therefore, important if adequate spontaneous improvement has not occurred. Large IHs can leave visible skin changes secondary to severe stretching that results in altered surface texture. Large segmental hemangiomas of the head and neck can be associated with a disorder called PHACES syndrome. Large segmental hemangiomas over the lumbar spine can be associated with dysraphism, renal, and urogenital problems in association with a disorder called LUMBAR syndrome. Multiple cutaneous hemangiomas in infants may be an indicator for liver hemangiomas. Screening for liver involvement is often recommended in infants with five or more skin hemangiomas. Causes The cause of hemangioma is currently unknown, but several studies have suggested the importance of estrogen signaling in proliferation. Localized soft-tissue hypoxia coupled with increased circulating estrogen after birth may be the stimulus. Also, a hypothesis was presented by researchers that maternal placenta embolizes to the fetal dermis during gestation, resulting in hemangiomagenesis. However, another group of researchers conducted genetic analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphism in hemangioma tissue compared to the mother's DNA that contradicted this hypothesis. Other studies have revealed the role of increased angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the etiology of hemangiomas. Diagnosis Capillary hemangioma The majority of IHs can be diagnosed by history and physical examination. In rare cases, imaging (ultrasound with Doppler, magnetic resonance imaging), and/or cytology or histopathology are needed to confirm the diagnosis. IHs are usually absent at birth or a small area of pallor, telangiectasias, or duskiness may be seen. A fully formed mass at birth usually indicates a diagnosis other than IH. Superficial hemangiomas in the upper dermis have a bright-red strawberry color, whereas those in the deep dermis and subcutis, deep hemangiomas, may appear blue and be firm or rubbery on palpation. Mixed hemangiomas can have both features. A minimally proliferative IH is an uncommon type that presents with fine macular telangiectasias with an occasional bright-red, papular, proliferative component. Minimally proliferative IHs are more common in the lower body. A precise history of the growth characteristics of the IH can be very helpful in making the diagnosis. In the first 4 to 8 weeks of life, IHs grow rapidly with primarily volumetric rather than radial growth. This is usually followed by a period of slower growth that can last 6‚Äì9 months, with 80% of the growth completed by 3 months. Finally, IHs involute over a period of years. The exceptions to these growth characteristics include minimally proliferative His, which do not substantially proliferate and large, deep IHs in which noticeable growth starts later and lasts longer. If the diagnosis is not clear based on physical examination and growth history (most often in deep hemangiomas with little cutaneous involvement), then either imaging or histopathology can help confirm the diagnosis. On Doppler ultrasound, an IH in the proliferative phase appears as a high-flow, soft-tissue mass usually without direct arteriovenous shunting. On MRI, IHs show a well-circumscribed lesion with intermediate and increased signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences, respectively, and strong enhancement after gadolinium injections, with fast-flow vessels. Tissue for diagnosis can be obtained via fine-needle aspiration, skin biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Under the microscope, IHs are unencapsulated aggregates of closely packed, thin-walled capillaries, usually with endothelial lining. Blood-filled vessels are separated by scant connective tissue. Their lumina may be thrombosed and organized. Hemosiderin pigment deposition due to vessel rupture may be observed.Kumar Vinay: Robbins and Coltran pathologic basis of disease 8ed.. pp. 520-521 Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier, 2010. The GLUT-1 histochemical marker can be helpful in distinguishing IHs from other items on the differential diagnosis, such as vascular malformations. Treatment Most IHs disappear without treatment, leaving minimal to no visible marks. This may take many years, however, and a proportion of lesions may require some form of therapy. Multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines for the management of infantile hemangiomas were recently published. Indications for treatment include functional impairment (i.e. visual or feeding compromise), bleeding, potentially life-threatening complications (airway, cardiac, or hepatic disease), and risk of long-term or permanent disfigurement. Large IHs can leave visible skin changes secondary to significant stretching of the skin or alteration of surface texture. When they interfere with vision, breathing, or threaten significant disfigurement (most notably facial lesions, and in particular, nose and lips), they are usually treated. Medical therapies are most effective when used during the period of most significant hemangioma growth, which corresponds to the first 5 months of life. Ulcerated hemangiomas, a subset of lesions requiring therapy, are usually treated by addressing wound care, pain, and hemangioma growth. =Medication= Treatment options for IHs include medical therapies (systemic, intralesional, and topical), surgery, and laser therapy. Prior to 2008, the mainstay of therapy for problematic hemangiomas was oral corticosteroids, which are effective and remain an option for patients in whom beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or poorly tolerated. Following the serendipitous observation that propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker, is well tolerated and effective for treatment of hemangiomas,Hogeling M et al. (2011) \\"A randomized controlled trial of propranolol for infantile hemangiomas\\". Pediatrics 128 (2): e259‚Äìe266. the agent was studied in a large, randomized, controlled trial and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication in 2014.United States Food and Drug Administration. http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/205410s000lbl.pdf; accessed 9/29/15. Propranolol has subsequently become the first-line systemic medical therapy for treatment of these lesions. Since that time, topical timolol maleate in addition to oral propranalol has become a common therapy for infantile hemangiomas. According to a 2018 Cochrane review, both of these therapies have demonstrated beneficial effects in terms of clearance of hemangiomas without an increase in harms. In addition, no difference was detected between these two agents and their ability to reduce hemangioma size; however, whether a difference in safety exists is not clear. All of these results were based on moderate- to low-quality evidence, thus further randomized, controlled trials with large populations of children are needed to further evaluate these therapies. This review concluded that for now, no evidence challenges oral propranalol as the standard systemic therapy for treatment of these lesions. Other systemic therapies which may be effective for IH treatment include vincristine, interferon, and other agents with antiangiogenic properties. Vincristine, which requires central venous access for administration, is traditionally used as a chemotherapy agent, but has been demonstrated to have efficacy against hemangiomas and other childhood vascular tumors, such as kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma. Interferon-alpha 2a and 2b, given by subcutaneous injection, has shown efficacy against hemangiomas, but may result in spastic diplegia in up to 20% of treated children.Barlow CF, Priebe CJ, Mulliken JB, et al. Spastic diplegia as a complication of interferon alfa-2a treatment of hemangiomas of infancy. J Pediatr 1998;132(3 pt 1):527-30. These agents are rarely used now in the era of beta-blocker therapy. Intralesional corticosteroid (usually triamcinolone) injection has been used for small, localized hemangiomas, where it has been demonstrated to be relatively safe and effective.Chantharatanapiboon W. Intralesional corticosteroid therapy in hemangiomas: clinical outcome in 160 cases. J Med Assoc Thai 2008;91(suppl 3):S90-6. Injection of upper eyelid hemangiomas is controversial, given the reported risk of retinal embolization, possibly related to high injection pressures. Topical timolol maleate, a nonselective beta blocker available in a gel-forming solution approved for the treatment of glaucoma, has been increasingly recognized as a safe and effective off-label alternative for treatment of small hemangiomas. It is generally applied two to three times daily. =Surgery= Surgical excision of hemangiomas is rarely indicated, and limited to lesions which fail medical therapy (or when it is contraindicated), which are anatomically distributed in a location which is amenable to resection, and in which resection would likely be necessary and the scar will be similar regardless of timing of the surgery. Surgery may also be useful for removal of residual fibrofatty tissue (following hemangioma involution) and reconstruction of damaged structures. =Laser= Laser therapy, most often the pulsed dye laser (PDL), plays a limited role in hemangioma management. PDL is most often used for treatment of ulcerated hemangiomas, often in conjunction with topical therapies and wound care, and may speed healing and diminish pain. Laser therapy may also be useful for early superficial IHs (although rapidly proliferating lesions may be more prone to ulceration following PDL treatment), and for the treatment of cutaneous telangiectasias which persist following involution. Prognosis In the involution phase, an IH finally begins to diminish in size. While IHs were previously thought to improve by about 10% each year, newer evidence suggests that maximal improvement and involution is typically reached by 3.5 years of age. Most IHs resolve by age 10, but in some patients, the hemangioma does not completely resolve. Residual redness may be noted and can be improved with laser therapy, most commonly PDL. Ablative fractional resurfacing may be considered for textural skin changes. Hemangiomas, especially those that have gotten very large during the growth phase, may leave behind stretched skin or fibrofatty tissue that may be disfiguring or require future surgical correction. Areas of prior ulceration may leave behind permanent scarring. Additional long-term sequelae stem from the identification of extracutaneous manifestations in association with the IH. For example, a patient with a large facial hemangioma who is found to meet criteria for PHACE syndrome will require potentially ongoing neurologic, cardiac, and/or ophthalmologic monitoring. In cases of IHs that compromise of vital structures, symptoms may improve with involution of the hemangioma. For example, respiratory distress would improve with involution of a space-occupying IH involving the airway and high-output heart failure may lessen with involution of a hepatic hemangioma and ultimately treatment may be tapered or discontinued. In other cases, such as an untreated eyelid hemangioma, resultant amblyopia does not improve with involution of the cutaneous lesion. For these reasons, infants with infantile hemangiomas should be evaluated by an appropriate clinician during the early proliferative phase so that risk monitoring and treatment be individualized and outcomes can be optimized. Terminology The terminology used to define, describe, and categorize vascular tumors and malformations has changed over time. The term hemangioma was originally used to describe any vascular tumor- like structure, whether it was present at or around birth or appeared later in life. In 1982, Mulliken and Glowacki proposed a new classification system for vascular anomalies which has been widely accepted and adopted by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies. This classification system was recently updated in 2015. The classification of vascular anomalies is now based upon cellular features, natural history, and clinical behavior of the lesion. Vascular anomalies are divided into vascular tumors/neoplasms which include infantile hemangiomas, and vascular malformations that include entities with enlarged or abnormal vessels such as capillary malformations (port wine stains), venous malformations, and lymphatic malformations. In 2000, GLUT-1, a specific immunohistochemical marker, was found to be positive in IHs and negative in other vascular tumors or malformations. This marker has revolutionized the ability to distinguish between infantile hemangioma and other vascular anomalies. =References=  External links  Category:Benign neoplasms Category:Dermal and subcutaneous growths Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate zh:Ë°ÄÁÆ°Áò§ ","title":"Infantile hemangioma"},{"id":"862515","text":":For the publication of Phi Beta Kappa, see The American Scholar (magazine). Ralph Waldo Emerson \\"The American Scholar\\" was a speech given by Ralph Waldo Emerson on August 31, 1837, to the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Harvard College at the First Parish in Cambridge in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was invited to speak in recognition of his groundbreaking work Nature, published a year earlier, in which he established a new way for America's fledgling society to regard the world. Sixty years after declaring independence, American culture was still heavily influenced by Europe, and Emerson, for possibly the first time in the country's history, provided a visionary philosophical framework for escaping \\"from under its iron lids\\" and building a new, distinctly American cultural identity. Summary Emerson introduces Transcendentalist and Romantic views to explain an American scholar's relationship to nature. A few key points he makes include: * We are all fragments, \\"as the hand is divided into fingers\\", of a greater creature, which is mankind itself. * An individual may live in either of two states. In one, the busy, \\"divided\\" or \\"degenerate\\" state, he does not \\"possess himself\\" but identifies with his occupation or a monotonous action; in the other, \\"right\\" state, he is elevated to \\"Man\\", at one with all mankind. * To achieve this higher state of mind, the modern American scholar must reject old ideas and think for him or herself, to become \\"Man Thinking\\" rather than \\"a mere thinker, or still worse, the parrot of other men's thinking\\", \\"the victim of society\\", \\"the sluggard intellect of this continent\\". * \\"The American Scholar\\" has an obligation, as \\"Man Thinking\\", within this \\"One Man\\" concept, to see the world clearly, not severely influenced by traditional and historical views, and to broaden his understanding of the world from fresh eyes, to \\"defer never to the popular cry.\\" * The scholar's education consists of three influences: ** I. Nature as the most important influence on the mind ** II. The Past manifest in books **III. Action and its relation to experience * The last, unnumbered part of the text is devoted to Emerson's view on the \\"Duties\\" of the American Scholar who has become the \\"Man Thinking.\\" * \\" The scholar must needs stand wistful and admiring before this great spectacle. He must settle its value in his mind\\" Importance Emerson was, in part, reflecting on his personal vocational crisis after leaving his role as a minister.Cayton, Mary Kupiec (1989). Emerson's Emergence: Self and Society in the Transformation of New England, 1800‚Äì1845. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. p. 145. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. declared this speech to be \\"the declaration of independence of American intellectual life.\\"Cheever, Susan (2006). American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau; Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work. Detroit: Thorndike Press. Large print edition. p. 80. Building on the growing attention he received from the essay Nature, The American Scholar solidified Emerson's popularity and weight in America, a level of reverence he would hold throughout the rest of his life. Phi Beta Kappa's literary quarterly magazine, The American Scholar, was named after the speech. This success stands in contrast with the harsh reaction to another of his speeches, \\"Divinity School Address\\", given eleven months later.

It runs from I-80 near Sharon south and east to a junction with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76, its parent) in Monroeville, after having crossed the Turnpike at an interchange earlier in its route. The route serves Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and its surrounding areas, and is the main access road to Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). Portions of the route are known as the Beaver Valley Expressway, Southern Expressway, and Airport Parkway. Within Allegheny County, the route runs along the majority of the Penn-Lincoln Parkway, known locally as Parkway West and Parkway East. It is currently the ninth-longest auxiliary Interstate route in the system, and second only to I-476 within Pennsylvania. I-376 is signed east‚Äìwest despite running north‚Äìsouth for nearly three-quarters of its length; however, it does run east‚Äìwest through the majority of Allegheny County. This is because until 2009, the route's western terminus was at I-279 in Downtown Pittsburgh; it was extended west and north to I-80 to give the corridor a single route designation. Despite the route's direction, it serves as a major artery through Pittsburgh's West End, with I-79 being the primary route through Pittsburgh's North Hills. Since its 2009 extension, the route has also served as a major way to access Northeast Ohio. A stretch of the Beaver Valley Expressway, officially named the James E. Ross Highway, from exit 15 where I-376 ends its brief concurrency with U.S. Route 422 (US 422) to exit 31 where I-376 has its first interchange with Pennsylvania Route 51 (PA 51), is tolled and is maintained by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, while the remainder of the highway is maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). Near the airport, I-376 also has a business loop. Route description =Beaver Valley Expressway and Airport Parkway= Lawrence County's North Beaver Township. I-376 begins at a cloverleaf interchange with I-80 and Pennsylvania Route 760 located four miles east of Ohio within the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. From there, it travels in a southerly direction on the Beaver Valley Expressway, a four-lane freeway with a wide grass median. Paralleling PA 18, I-376 has its first interchange with that state highway in West Middlesex. I-376 soon meets US 422 and forms an overlap with that highway along the west side of New Castle. After an interchange with US 224 in Union Township, I-376 eastbound splits from US 422 at a trumpet interchange southwest of the city in Taylor Township. At this point, I-376 becomes a tolled freeway officially named the James E. Ross Highway. I-376 continues southward, still paralleled by PA 18 and the Beaver River to the east. Shortly after entering Beaver County near Koppel, the route connects to its parent (I-76 on the Pennsylvania Turnpike) for the first time at an interchange which also provides access to PA 351\\\\. Around this area, I-376 crosses into the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau, where it remains for the remainder of its length. I-376 then passes to the east of West Mayfield and becomes a non-tolled highway again at its first interchange with PA 51 in Chippewa Township, just west of Beaver Falls. The freeway then weaves through mountainous terrain, interchanging with PA 68 in Vanport just before crossing the Vanport Bridge over the Ohio River. It then has its second interchange with PA 18 near Kobuta and continues south from there. I-376 passes to the west of Aliquippa before leaving Beaver County and entering Allegheny County. Approaching Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT), I-376 bends south- southwest and becomes the Southern Expressway, while the Beaver Valley Expressway diverges to the southeast along I-376 Bus. I-376 circles around the southern edge of the airport, intersecting the western terminus of the Southern Beltway (PA Turnpike 576) at the main entrance to PIT before recombining with I-376 Bus. and becoming the Airport Parkway, still four lanes and with a narrow median. =Parkway West= I-376 westbound at the PA 121 exit in Green Tree Now traveling southeast, the route comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Penn-Lincoln Parkway (US 22 and US 30) and Steubenville Pike (PA 60) in Robinson Township. The two U.S. Highways join I-376 here in a partially-unsigned concurrency (indicated only on reassurance markers), continuing east-southeastward bearing the Penn-Lincoln Parkway name, and soon reach an interchange with I-79. From that point eastward, along what was known for many years as I-279, I-376 runs east-southeast through Rosslyn Farms and Carnegie before turning northeast and passing through Green Tree. Entering the city of Pittsburgh, I-376 winds its way northeast to its second interchange with PA 51 at Saw Mill Run Boulevard, which is also part of a spread-out series of ramps linking Banksville Road (US 19) and US 19 Truck. This junction, located just before the freeway passes under Mount Washington in the Fort Pitt Tunnel, features the infamous wrong-way concurrency of the northbound and southbound directions of US 19 Truck. I-376 westbound between the Fort Pitt Bridge and Fort Pitt Tunnel After passing through the Fort Pitt Tunnel, I-376 emerges onto the four-lane double-deck Fort Pitt Bridge, crossing over the Monongahela River. There are single-lane westbound exit and eastbound entrance ramps connecting Carson Street to the freeway between the tunnel's portal and the bridge. Once across the river, the route touches down in Downtown Pittsburgh at Point State Park. An interchange at the Point connects I-376 to I-279 (Parkway North), which leads to the Fort Duquesne Bridge, as well as Liberty Avenue. =Parkway East= I-376 continues east from the Point, still carrying the partially-unsigned US 22 and US 30, following the north shore of the Monongahela River through the south side of the downtown area (the westbound area by Downtown from Grant Street to the Fort Pitt Bridge is locally known as the Bathtub because of a tendency of the underpass to flood in heavy rains). The road then continues to the adjacent neighborhoods of Soho and Oakland. The Parkway East eventually turns away from the river near the southwestern corner of Schenley Park and runs along that park's southern border before passing through the Squirrel Hill Tunnel under Squirrel Hill. I-376 westbound approaching Downtown Pittsburgh Parkway East exits the city of Pittsburgh near the southeastern corner of Frick Park, and US 30 leaves the freeway shortly thereafter at PA 8 in the suburb of Wilkinsburg. I-376 and US 22 (now fully signed) continue in a generally easterly direction through Churchill, Wilkins Township, Penn Hills, and finally Monroeville, where I-376 ends at an interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike and US 22 Business. US 22 continues east from this interchange on the William Penn Highway towards Murrysville. I-376 westbound at the Squirrel Hill Tunnel Tolls The James E. Ross Highway portion of I-376 between US 422 and PA 51 uses all-electronic tolling, with tolls payable by toll-by-plate (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass. The tolled section of I-376 has two mainline toll plazas: the West Mainline Toll Plaza near milepost 18 and the East Mainline Toll Plaza near milepost 30. As of 2020, the West Mainline Toll Plaza costs $4.30 using toll-by-plate and $2.10 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles while the East Mainline Toll Plaza costs $2.70 using toll-by-plate and $1.10 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles. There are also ramp tolls at the eastbound exit and westbound entrance at exit 17, the westbound exit and eastbound entrance at exit 20, and the eastbound exit and westbound entrance at exit 29, which charge $2.70 using toll-by-plate and $1.10 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles. As part of Act 44, tolls are to be increased every year in January. The tolled portion of I-376 is the most expensive portion of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system per mile, charging toll- by-plate users an average of 44 cents/mile and E-ZPass users 20 cents/mile. This is in stark contrast to the mainline Turnpike, which charges less than 12 cents/mile for E-ZPass users and more than 17 cents/mile for cash users. This is due to the bonds on newer sections of the Turnpike system (such as the James E. Ross Highway, Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass, Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway, and the Southern Beltway) having not been paid for yet (in the case of the latter two, are only partially completed), whereas the mainline Turnpike and the Northeastern Extension had their bonds paid for decades ago. Even with the newer sections factored in‚Äîmost of which except for a portion of the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway from I-70 near Bentleyville to US 40 near Brownsville opened after the James E. Ross Highway opened‚Äîit is the most expensive portion of the Turnpike system per mile. Along with the Delaware River‚ÄìTurnpike Toll Bridge (which is affected by the ongoing Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project), the Beaver Valley Expressway became one of the first sections of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system to implement all-electronic tolling, which began along the Beaver Valley Expressway on April 30, 2017. The Beaver Valley Expressway was selected as a test area so that the PTC could work out any bugs with mailing non-E-ZPass users bills with their unpaid tolls. History I-376 westbound from the Smithfield Street Bridge in Downtown Pittsburgh. The first section of what would eventually become I-376 opened June 5, 1953, from PA 885 (Bates Street) near the Hot Metal Bridge east through the Squirrel Hill Tunnel to US 22 Business (then US 22) at Churchill. Construction commenced on this stretch on July 25, 1946 near Wilkinsburg. The next section to open, running from PA 60 (Steubenville Pike, then US 22/US 30) near Pittsburgh International Airport east to Saw Mill Run Boulevard (PA 51 and US 19), opened October 15, 1953. At Steubenville Pike, it connected to PA 60‚Äîthe Airport Parkway‚Äîwhich had been built c. 1950 as a high-speed surface road to provide access to the airport. In 1955, the Baltimore and Ohio Station was demolished to make way for construction of the new freeway. In late 1956, it opened from the Boulevard of the Allies (then US 22/US 30) near the Birmingham Bridge east to Bates Street, with the eastbound lanes opening September 10 and westbound opening September 29. The other downtown sections opened in segments from January 17, 1958 to 1959, the total cost of the parkway at this time came to $112.107 million (1959 terms). The $6.305 million Fort Pitt Bridge opened June 19, 1959, followed by the $16 million Fort Pitt Tunnel on September 1, 1960, using the West End Bypass (Pennsylvania Route 51) and Carson Street (Pennsylvania Route 837) as detours until the Fort Pitt Tunnel opened. The Parkway East ended in Churchill, with eastbound traffic continuing ahead on the William Penn Highway, until the $11,124,763 extension east to the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Monroeville opened October 27, 1962. The final piece of Parkway West (the part which has never had an Interstate route number), from PA 60 west to the US 22/US 30 split at Imperial, opened in 1964. Early plans for that section would have instead taken it from PA 60 where it splits with PA Route 60 Business northwest to US 30 near Campmeeting Road at Clinton. The next section that opened was in 1968 from the present-day exit 2 with PA 18 to where PA 18 intersects with the present-day PA 760 just north of I-80 and the western terminus of I-376. Work began on the Beaver County sections of I-376 (in between Chippewa Township and the Airport Parkway) in 1971 and would finish by 1976. The following year, the northern section finished construction, which would leave a gap between New Castle and Chippewa Township for the next 15 years. Until the middle section was completed, in order to continue on the highway, travelers had to use US 422, PA 168, PA 18, PA 251, and PA 51 before returning to the highway. Until that section opened, the present-day exit 12A marked the southern terminus of the northern section of PA 60 as an \\"END 60\\" sign was located near the exit. In the early to mid 1980s the entire section from downtown to Monroeville was refurbished. I-376 at the former terminus with I-279 The next leg of the route opened to PA 108 in 1991 and to PA 51 in Chippewa on November 30, 1992 as the 16.5 mile $260 million \\"missing link\\" between two sections of PA 60, when that route's designation was on the highway. The aforementioned \\"END 60\\" sign was removed when the first leg of the middle section opened in 1991, and a \\"No re-entry this exit\\" sign has sat on the site since, due to exit 12A being an indirect connection to US 422 westbound without a direct re-entry ramp. The Southern Expressway, a southern bypass of Pittsburgh International Airport, opened on September 9, 1992 and is the newest portion of I-376. The PTC retrofitted E-ZPass lanes on the tolled section of I-376 in 2006 at both the two mainline toll plazas as well as the exits that collect tolls. A bridge crossing I-376 from Oakland to Greenfield, the Greenfield Bridge, gained some national notoriety on an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver concerning infrastructure. The state could not immediately afford to replace the crumbling bridge, so instead a cover was built under the bridge to protect the vehicles on I-376. The Greenfield Bridge was finally demolished in December 2015, and a replacement was built over the following two years, officially opening on October 14, 2017.Greenfield Bridge Opens Early After All-Day Celebration KDKA-TV (10/14/2017) =Route designations prior to 2009= The western end of I-376 at I-279 in Pittsburgh in 2003. From PA 60 to I-376's eastern terminus, I-376 has had the US 22 and US 30 designations for its entire history (US 30 exiting at Wilkinsburg). Until 1961, it also carried the PA 80 designation until that route was decommissioned due to Pennsylvania needing the designation for I-80 to the north. In 1956, Pennsylvania Route 60 was commissioned to have the Airport Parkway and the former alignment of US 22 and US 30 to Pittsburgh's West End. From 1959 to 1964, I-70 occupied the highway east of PA 50 in Carnegie. When I-70 moved to its current alignment (replacing I-70S) in 1964, the route received the Interstate 76 designation into Pittsburgh. West of Pittsburgh, from 1963 to 1970, I-79 occupied the route. In West Middlesex, the route would receive the PA 18 designation while the former alignment would receive a business route designation as PA 18 Business, since it served as a bypass of West Middlesex. In 1970, I-79 swapped positions with I-279, necessitating that I-76 be extended to I-79. With commencement on the Beaver Valley Expressway in 1971, PA 60 was extended to its future northern terminus in Chippewa. Finally, on October 2, 1972, after I-76 west of Monroeville moved to the Pennsylvania Turnpike and replaced I-80S, the western part of the highway took the I-279 designation while the section from Pittsburgh east to Monroeville would become the first section with the I-376 designation. When I-376 was extended onto the Parkway West in 2009, I-279 was truncated to its current southern terminus at the former western terminus of I-376. PA 18 Business was decommissioned in 1978 when PA 18 returned to its former alignment (where it has remained to this day) and PA 60 was extended all the way to Hermitage. On November 30, 1992 the 16.2 mile gap in Beaver County was completed with a toll highway. When the Beaver Valley Expressway started opening in 1991, it would receive the \\"PA Toll 60\\" designation, because it was operated by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. With the opening of the Southern Expressway in 1992, PA 60 moved to that highway, while the Airport Parkway received the PA 60 Business designation. PA 60 was eventually extended to Sharon in 1997, ending at US 62 Business. =2009 extensions= Signs reading \\"Future I-376 Corridor\\" were posted along PA 60 from late April 2006 until 2010. This one was located on the New Castle Bypass. As part of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users in 2005, the U.S. Congress had designated an expansion of I-376 past I-79 and along present day US 22/US 30 and PA 60 through the Pittsburgh International Airport and north to I-80 near Sharon, Pennsylvania. This was done because the airport was one of the few major airports in the United States without direct access to an Interstate highway. This routing required some major infrastructure work on US 22 west of Downtown Pittsburgh (particularly at the US 22/US 30 cloverleaf in Robinson Township) and safety improvements to PA 60; though both were limited access freeways before the extension, they were not up to Interstate Highway standards in all areas. The improvements to both the US 22/US 30 cloverleaf in Robinson Township and the Lawrence County leg of the route, as well as replacing all of the signs with the I-376 shield, were funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The designation of I-279 from Downtown west through the Fort Pitt Tunnel to I-79 was officially dropped and replaced by that of I-376 on June 10, 2009. I-279 still exists between I-376 in the Golden Triangle and I-79 in Franklin Park. On November 6, 2009, officials announced the initial transition was complete. On January 21, 2010, the remainder of the route except for the Beaver Valley Expressway started receiving the I-376 signs. The stretch of PA 60 from I-80 in Shenango Township of Mercer County north past PA 18 (where the freeway terminates and the highway reverts to being a two lane arterial) to the former northern terminus of PA 60 in Sharon became PA 760. A \\"Toll I-376\\" trailblazer on the tolled section of I-376. On August 1, 2010, signage along Turnpike 60 was officially changed to I-376, and unlike other tolled highways with Interstate designation it is not grandfathered from Interstate standards. Having been built in the early 1990s, this section was already up to Interstate standards. This section of I-376 is signed as \\"Toll I-376\\", with a black-on-yellow \\"Toll\\" sign above the I-376 trailblazer. This makes I-376 one of the first tolled Interstates with such a marker, which was a new addition to the 2009 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Despite PennDOT giving motorists over four years of advance notice on the I-376 extension, some local drivers were confused after the transition was complete, thinking that the I-376 extension was going to be an all-new highway instead of a renaming of PA 60. As part of the ongoing upgrades to I-376 to bring the legacy portion of the former PA 60 up to Interstate standards, the interchange with PA 318 at exit 1C was upgraded to a full service interchange in October 2014. Previously, the exit only had a westbound entrance and eastbound exit, mainly to serve as access to I-80 to West Middlesex residents. It marked the third partial interchange on the legacy PA 60/Parkway West to be upgraded to a full-service interchange in a decade, after I-79 at exit 64A and access to US 30 at exit 52 were upgraded from a partial to full-service interchanges. Exit list Business loop shield in Moon Townshipupright Interstate 376 Business (I-376 Bus.) or Business Loop 376 (BL-376), known locally as the Airport Parkway, is a Interstate Highway business loop in Moon Township and Findlay Township, Pennsylvania. Its western terminus is at I-376 and Flaugherty Run Road (exits 50 and 51) north of Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). Its eastern terminus is at I-376's exit 57, southeast of PIT. Before November 6, 2009, and after the Southern Expressway was completed in 1992, this road was known as Pennsylvania Route 60 Business. Prior to that, it had the regular PA 60 designation; this was also originally the last leg of the Parkway West which ended at the intersection with then-Beers School Road (now University Boulevard) and began as the Beaver Valley Expressway past the intersection. Much of the road is up to freeway standards, but several signaled at-grade intersections remain, making this multi-lane divided road a true expressway (unlike many of Pennsylvania's freeways, which are often misleadingly named using the suffix expressway, since they are often called such in the northeast). I-376 Bus. is one of only two business Interstate routes found in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the other being the business loop of Interstate 83 in York.

The highway is long. I-579 is also known as the Crosstown Boulevard since it crosses the backside of Downtown Pittsburgh. The northern terminus of I-579 is at Interstate 279 beyond the north end of the Veterans Bridge; the southern terminus splits to the Liberty Bridge southbound and Boulevard of the Allies eastbound, which leads to Interstate 376 East. The intersection of I-579 and I-279 is in one direction only; northbound traffic on I-579 can proceed only northbound on I-279, while only southbound traffic on I-279 can exit onto I-579. I-579 allows Liberty Bridge traffic easy access to I-279, and I-279 southbound traffic easier access to PPG Paints Arena, downtown, and eastern regions of the city, while I-279 southbound continues to Heinz Field, PNC Park, and to westbound I-376 which leads to the Pittsburgh International Airport. Route description I-579 running through downtown Pittsburgh I-579 begins at an interchange with PA 885 (Boulevard of the Allies) and the approach to the Liberty Bridge over the Monongahela River in Downtown Pittsburgh, heading to the north-northeast as a four-lane freeway. At the southern terminus, the highway has a northbound exit and southbound entrance providing access to 6th Avenue and Forbes Avenue near Duquesne University. The road passes several skyscrapers as it comes to an interchange at Centre Avenue with a northbound exit and southbound entrance that provides access to the PPG Paints Arena. Immediately following is a left exit in the northbound direction and a southbound entrance that connects to 7th Avenue that serves the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. At this point, I-579 runs to the west of the former site of the Civic Arena and comes to the PA 380 interchange, a northbound exit and southbound entrance, in addition to a southbound exit and northbound entrance accessing 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue. The freeway turns north as it passes over railroad tracks to the east of Union Station, the Amtrak station serving Pittsburgh. Here, it is seven lanes total with three travel lanes in each direction and two reversible high-occupancy vehicle lanes in the center. The HOV lanes connect to Bedford Avenue near the Civic Arena at the south end. The highway turns northwest as it crosses the Allegheny River on the Veterans Bridge. A short distance after the bridge, I-579 ends at an interchange with I-279/US 19 Truck and PA 28, at which point the route merges into northbound I-279 with ramps to and from northbound PA 28. History I-579's roots go back to 1966 when the short 0.7 mile Crosstown Boulevard from the Boulevard of the Allies (PA 885) to Bigelow Boulevard (PA 380) was designated as Interstate 479. Despite the choice of number, its parent I-79 was only completed in certain areas; there would be no connection of the two routes until 1989. By 1971, with only little progression of I-79 near I-479's northern terminus and easy (but indirect) access to then-I-76 (now I-376 Parkway East) from the southern terminus, I-479 was renumbered as Interstate 876. This was renumbered again on October 2, 1972 as its current designation of I-579; in addition, I-79's designation from Pittsburgh to Robinson Township was \\"swapped\\" with I-279's segment south of the Ohio River from PA 51 to the Parkway West interchange. In 1989, both of I-79's auxiliary routes were finally connected with the openings of I-279 (Parkway North) from the Fort Duquesne Bridge/North Shore to its northern terminus at I-79 in Franklin Park and the Veterans Bridge which extended I-579 across the Allegheny River to its new northern terminus at I-279 in Pittsburgh's East Allegheny neighborhood. In 2019, the I-579 Cap Urban Connector Project began in order to build a pedestrian park over I-579 with the goal of better connecting downtown to the Hill District. The project is expected to conclude in 2021.

His parents were Mar√≠a Hern√°ndez Mar√≠n and Miguel Angel Rosa, though he was given only his mother's surname. As a child, he learned the craft of cigar making, from which he made a modest living. He also grew to love music and asked his parents to permit him to become a full-time music student. When he was 12 years old, Hern√°ndez studied music in San Juan, under the guidance of music professors Jose Ruellan Lequenica and Jes√∫s Figueroa. He learned to play many musical instruments, among them the clarinet, tuba, violin, piano, and guitar.Rafael Hernandez Puerto Rico's Soul At the age of 14, he played for the Cocolia Orquestra. Hern√°ndez moved to San Juan where he played for the municipal orchestra under the director Manuel Tizol. In 1913, Hern√°ndez begot his first child, Antonio Hern√°ndez (out of wedlock), to Ana Bone. =World War I and the Orchestra Europe= Rafael Hern√°ndez (left) with his brother Jes√∫s during World War I, c. 1917. In 1917, Hern√°ndez was working as a musician in North Carolina, when the United States entered World War I. The jazz bandleader James Reese Europe recruited brothers Rafael and Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez, and 16 more Puerto Ricans to join the United States Army's Harlem Hell fighters musical band, the Orchestra Europe. He enlisted and was assigned to the U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment (formerly known as the 15th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard, created in New York City June 2, 1913). The regiment, nicknamed \\"The Harlem Hell Fighters\\" by the Germans, served in France. Hern√°ndez toured Europe with the Orchestra Europe. The 369th was awarded the French Croix de guerre for battlefield gallantry by the President of France.\\\\- The Great Slsa Timeline =Hernandez and Pedro Flores= After the war, Hern√°ndez moved to New York City. In the 1920s, he started writing songs and organized a trio called \\"Trio Borincano\\". In 1926, fellow Puerto Rican Pedro Flores joined the Trio. Even though Hern√°ndez and Flores became and always remained good friends, they soon went their separate ways and artistically competed against each other. After the trio broke up, he formed a quartet called \\"Cuarteto Victoria\\" which included singer Myrta Silva, also known as La Guarachera and La Gorda de Oro. With both groups, Hern√°ndez traveled and played his music all over the United States and Latin America.Hernandez Marin, Rafael On September 2, 1927, Hern√°ndez' sister Victoria opened Casa Hernandez, a music store which also acted as a booking agency and base of operations for her brother. In 1929, Tr√≠o Borinquen recorded Linda Quisqueya (originally titled Linda Borinquen) and that same year he founded the \\"Cuarteto Victoria\\" (also known as \\"El Cuarteto Rico\\") named after his sister. In 1932, Hern√°ndez moved to Mexico. There, he directed an orchestra and enrolled in Mexico's National Music Conservatory to further enrich his musical knowledge. Hern√°ndez also became an actor and organized musical scores in Mexico's \\"golden age\\" of movies. His wife (and eventual widow) is Mexican. =\\"Lamento borincano\\" and \\"Preciosa\\"= In 1937, Hern√°ndez wrote \\"Lamento Borincano\\". That same year, he also wrote \\"Preciosa\\".

Many of his compositions were strongly based on Cuban musical idioms, such as the guaracha's \\"Cachita\\" and \\"Buchipluma na' ma'\\", which were often mistaken as songs by Cuban authors. His music became an important part of Puerto Rican culture.History of Puerto Rico =Later years and death= Hern√°ndez was Honorary President of the Authors and Composers Association. He was also the founder of little league baseball in Puerto Rico. President John F. Kennedy christened him \\"Mr. Cumbanchero\\". Hern√°ndez died in San Juan on December 11, 1965, shortly after Banco Popular de Puerto Rico produced a TV special in his honor in which he addressed the people for the last time. The special was simulcast on all TV and most island radio stations. The TV special was rebroadcast on May 13, 2007. Rafael Hern√°ndez's remains are buried in the Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery of Old San Juan. Legacy Puerto Rico has honored his memory by naming public buildings, avenues and schools after him. The airport in Aguadilla is named Rafael Hern√°ndez Airport. There are schools in New York City, Boston, and in Newark, New Jersey named after Rafael Hern√°ndez. Renowned Puerto Rican sculptor Tom√°s Batista created a statue of Hern√°ndez which is in the municipality of Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico. The Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, the repository of his works, operates a small museum in his honor at its Metropolitan Campus in San Juan which is directed by his son, Alejandro (Chal√≠) Hern√°ndez. The Hernandez Houses housing complex in New York City is named after Rafael Hern√°ndez. At the behest former senator Lucy Arce, the Senate of Puerto Rico, under the first term of Thomas Rivera Schatz built the Rafael Hern√°ndez Plaza with a bigger-than-lifesize statue of the composer, and a statue of a Puerto Rican j√≠baro riding a horse honoring his Lamento Borincano. The park is located at the easternmost tip of San Juan's Paseo de la Covadonga. Puerto Rican singer Marc Anthony recorded Hern√°ndez's \\"Preciosa\\" and sang the song in a 2005 concert in New York City's Madison Square Garden. According to an article in the New York Times: In 1969, Puerto Rican actor Orlando Rodriguez played Hernandez in the bio-pic El Jibarito Rafael, which was directed by the Mexican actor Juli√°n Soler. In 1999, Hern√°ndez was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame. On March 23, 2001, Casa Hernandez, the music store which served as Hernandez's booking agency and base of operations, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, reference #01000244, as \\"Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernandez\\".

She was appointed to the senate on January 2, 2009, where she initially sat as a Conservative. Early life and career Wallin was born in Wadena, Saskatchewan, and is of Swedish descent. Wallin spent much of her formative years in Wadena but completed her high school in Moose Jaw. In 1973,Biography pamelawallin.com she graduated with a degree in psychology and political science from the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus (now the University of Regina) and began her career as an officer at the Saskatchewan Federal Penitentiary. Politically, she was a member of The Waffle, a left-wing faction in the New Democratic Party that existed in the early to mid-1970s.Facebook comment by Waffle co-founder and co-leader Mel Watkins, May 17, 2013: \\"It is a known fact that Pamela Wallin was in the Waffle.\\" Journalism In 1974, she began her career in journalism, joining CBC Radio's news division. In 1978, she joined the Ottawa bureau of the Toronto Star where she remained for two years. In 1980 she joined CTV and became cohost, with Norm Perry, of Canada AM. In 1985, CTV named her its Ottawa bureau chief. She later rejoined Canada AM, hosting alongside J. D. Roberts. In 1992, CBC Television hired Wallin in a highly publicized move. For many years, The National had been followed by a 40-minute nightly newsmagazine hosted by Barbara Frum, called The Journal. However, as a result of Frum's death in March 1992, the CBC wanted to revamp and reposition its entire approach to news programming. In the fall of that year, Wallin and Peter Mansbridge debuted as the co-hosts of Prime Time News. Instead of Mansbridge reading the news on The National, followed by Frum introducing documentary and current affairs features and interviewing newsmakers on The Journal, the new show integrated the two former programs and featured Wallin and Mansbridge as equal co-hosts of the entire package. As well, the new show aired at 9 p.m., one hour earlier than the old National/Journal tandem. The show fared poorly in the ratings and by 1994 had returned to its old format and time slot, with Mansbridge reading the news, followed by Wallin hosting a magazine segment which eventually took on the name The National Magazine. In April 1995, Wallin was dropped as host of The Magazine,\\"CBC, Wallin come to terms after \`firing' from Prime Time\\".

Instead, she created her own production company, Pamela Wallin Productions, and launched a daily interview series called Pamela Wallin Live in 1995. Airing on CBC Newsworld and, in some years, on the CBC's main network as well, Pamela Wallin Live was a highly successful series which featured Wallin interviewing newsmakers, celebrities and other interesting personalities in a manner similar to CNN's Larry King Live. The show ran for four years before Wallin moved to the cable network TalkTV. In 2000, Wallin hosted the Canadian edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. Wallin has also published two books, Since You Asked () and Speaking of Success (), and has made cameo appearances on the Canadian comedy series Royal Canadian Air Farce and Corner Gas. Diplomatic and academic appointments In 2001, Wallin, along with then-Foreign Affairs Minister John Manley, was one of the organizers of the \\"Canada Loves New York\\" rally for Canadians to show their support after the September 11 attacks (Manley ran in the New York City Marathon in 2001, a contributing factor to organize the rally). On June 25, 2002, Wallin's television career came to an end when Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien advised Governor General Adrienne Clarkson to appoint Wallin to a four-year term as Canada's consul general in New York City, her first diplomatic posting. In 2003, Wallin and Senator Jerry Grafstein were honoured by the Canadian Society of New York for their ongoing commitment to strengthening the ties between Canada and the United States. In 2006, she became a senior advisor to the president of the Americas Society and the Council of the Americas in New York. One of the perquisites of the post of Consul General was an official residence on Park Avenue. In 2005, shortly before her term ended Wallin bought a apartment for $379,000 USD. In March 2007, she was appointed the seventh chancellor of the University of Guelph, being installed in June of the same year, and sat on the Panel on Canada's Future Role in Afghanistan, chaired by former cabinet minister John Manley. She was also appointed by the governor general as an honorary colonel of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Corporate boards In 2006, Wallin was appointed to the board of Bell Globemedia, owners of The Globe and Mail and CTV Inc. From 2007 to 2011 she served on the board of Oilsands Quest, Inc. and has also served on the board of Gluskin Sheff & Associates, Inc., an investment and wealth management firm and as a member of the advisory board of BMO Harris Bank.Pamela Wallin profile, Forbes.com In 2013, as a result of the Senate expense claims scandal she was embroiled in, Wallin resigned from all three paid positions she held outside of the Senate: as a director of Gluskin Sheff & Associates, a wealth management firm, in May 2013, the board of Porter Airlines in June 2013 after having been on the board since 2008, and the board of the Ideas Council. Canadian Senate On January 2, 2009, Wallin was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

Located approximately north of San Francisco, the name \\"Anderson Valley\\" applies broadly to several rural, unincorporated communities in or near the alluvial terraces along Anderson Creek and other tributaries to the Navarro River. It is named after William Anderson, an early European settler to the area. Geography The name \\"Anderson Valley\\" applies to a region stretching from Boonville (located on Anderson Creek) and Philo (located on Indian Creek) to Navarro (located on Soda Creek). Rancheria, Anderson, Indian and Soda creeks are tributaries to the Navarro River, which flows north and west through the coastal range to the Pacific Ocean; Dry Creek flows south into the Russian River watershed in Sonoma County. The main stem of the Navarro River begins less than a mile south of Philo at the confluence of Anderson Creek and Rancheria Creek. The mouth of the Navarro is south of Mendocino, California. Encompassing SECTION 2 (816 km¬≤), the Navarro River watershed is the largest coastal basin in Mendocino County. The area is not seismically active, though a minor fault runs along the Valley floor. The climate is tempered by cool marine air. Steep hills and mountains surround rolling to nearly level alluvial terraces. The dominant natural vegetation is a mixed forest of Coast Redwood, various native oak varieties, and Douglas fir. Elevation ranges from sea level to . The average annual precipitation ranges . The average annual temperature is about , and the average frost-free season ranges from 220 to 365 days. Towards the coast the summers are cool and moist with frequent fog, while the interior Anderson Valley proper features a warm to hot summer climate similar to nearby interior regions, with daytime highs occasionally in excess of . History Early Native American inhabitants of Anderson Valley were speakers of two of the seven Pomoan languages. The Late Pomo of what is now the Yorkville area spoke the Central Pomo language. The Tabahtea (Tah-bah- tay) Pomo of the Boonville area west to Navarro spoke the Northern Pomo language. These residents occupied nineteen known village sites, with an estimated population of 600 in 1855. The early European American settlers of Anderson Valley arrived after 1850. They practiced subsistence farming and expanded into resource extraction economies based on timber harvesting and livestock ranching. Some of the first European American settlers included Henry Beeson (who took part in the Bear Flag Revolt), his brother Isaac Beeson and William Anderson, their stepbrother, for whom the valley was named. The first wave of European American settlers included the Ornbaun, Hutsell, Barnett, Clow, Gschwend, McAbee, Rector, Burgess, Rawles, McGimsey, Witherell, Irish, Holgooden, Hiatt, Ball, Prather, Smalley, McSpadden, Wallace, Conrad, O'Barr, Bowen, Nunn, Vines, Buster, Farrer, Counts, Shields, Lawson, Williams, Donelly, Plaskett, Leonard, Hawkins, Stephens, Robinson, Tift, Perkins, Elliott, Ponad, Gasklii, Brayton, and Connard families. John Gschwend established the first water powered lumber mill along the Navarro River in 1857, and Thomas Hiatt built the first steam powered lumber mill in 1877 near present-day Boonville.History of Mendocino County California, Alley, Bowen & Co., San Francisco, 1880. In 1880 a human population of around 1,000 maintained 75,000 head of sheep and 20,000 head of cattle. Commercial production of apples and hops began before the turn of the century, along with the development of Boontling, the local folk language. The 1940s and 1950s were boom years, when industrial automation and modern highway transportation enabled rapid liquidation logging of the remaining redwood forests. Many commercial lumber mills were established to work the brief timber boom. By the 1960s the sheep, timber and apple sectors of the economy were in decline. Large tracts of land were removed from production and subdivided. The first commercial vineyards for wine grapes were planted. Marijuana production flourished with the influx of many new residents from the urban counterculture in the 1970s. By the 1980s the timber industry was reduced to two small specialty mills (lath and decorative fencing), the sheep industry to four working ranches of modest size, and the apple industry to a small fraction of its former planted area. In 1989 Sean Donovan of Boonville established KZYX, a community-based non-commercial, National Public Radio affiliated station. =Wine industry= A wine boom began in the 1980s. This led to the establishment of the Anderson Valley AVA, specializing in Alsatian varietals, Pinot noir and sparkling wine. The wine industry is currently the dominant contributor to the Anderson Valley economy, and major producers include Lazy Creek Vineyards and Roederer Estate. The major annual wine events are the Pinot Noir Festival the third weekend in May and the International Alsace Varietals Festival in late February. In addition to wine, there is a successful microbrewery, the Anderson Valley Brewing Company, on the outskirts of Boonville. Like much of Mendocino County, the hospitality industry is a natural adjunct to boutique alcohol production. Fine restaurants and quality lodging are in good supply. The pleasant natural environment and rural lifestyle attracts artists, writers, musicians and a variety of skilled crafts people. As in similar pastoral regions dependent upon a low-paid work force in the farm, hospitality and service sectors, degraded tenant housing is available for local employees, while upscale real estate inventory is generally priced beyond the typical household budget of resident unskilled laborers.

It premiered in April 1996 and has been watched by millions of spectators around the world. Quidam originated as a big-top show in Montreal and was converted into an arena format beginning with its 2010 tour in North America. It then changed back to the Big Top for a 3-month run in Seoul, South Korea before returning to an arena show for its tour to Oceania. The show performed for the final time in Christchurch, New Zealand on February 26, 2016. The entire show is imagined by a bored girl named Zo√© who is alienated and ignored by her parents. She dreams up the whimsical world of Quidam as a means of escaping the monotony of her life. The show's title refers to the feature character, a man without a head, carrying an umbrella and a bowler hat. Quidam is said to be the embodiment of both everyone and no one at the same time. According to Cirque du Soleil literature \\"Quidam: a nameless passer-by, a solitary figure lingering on a street corner, a person rushing past... One who cries out, sings and dreams within us all.\\" Set and technical information The minimalistic stage was designed by Michel Cr√™te to represent a monolithic structure such as an airport or train station where people are always coming and going. The major set element includes the five, all-aluminum, 120-foot (36.57-meter) arches above the stage, known as the t√©l√©ph√©rique. These allow performers to be transported onto and off the stage from above. Each rail of the t√©l√©ph√©rique has two trolleys: one to raise and lower the performer or equipment, and the second to transport it onto or off the stage. The stage floor is made of aluminum decks with a perforated, rubber-type mat. The perforations, of which there are over 200,000, allow light to pass through from below the stage, creating visual effects. The original Quidam stage was redesigned and incorporated into the Bazzar (Cirque du Soleil) grand chapiteau tour. The show premiered in November 2018. Cast The cast of Quidam has a cast of 45 acrobats, musicians, singers, and characters, some of which are detailed below. * Zo√©: She is the principal character and singer in Quidam. Although average in nature, she longs for excitement. * Father: Completely, though unwittingly, self-absorbed, this character is lost behind his newspaper until he eventually open his eyes to find himself among his family and loved ones. His white shoes are the only indication of a hidden personality. * Mother: Conveys an air of absence and alienation whilst inside her lie fear, frustration, and desire. Through the show, she rediscovers the intense feeling of being alive through pain and courage, play and love. * Quidam: The show's titular character, who is anonymous, everyone, and no one (the name means \\"passer by\\"). He may have stepped out of a surrealist painting or been conjured up out of Zo√©'s imagination. He is known for his bowler hat and umbrella despite being headless. * John/Mark: He is an eerie yet charming guide on our mysterious journey through the world of Quidam. Also is represented as a father figure to Zo√© hence him stepping into her father's shoes. The character changed of 'John' was played initially by John Gilkey and then by Mark Ward who performed the role from 1999 onwards. Sometime after this transition, the character's name changed to 'Mark'. * Target: A living human bullseye fired at by everyone but is always smiling. * Chiennes Blanches: The silent chorus, the nameless and the faceless, the dehumanized, mechanical crowd, simultaneously leading and following. They also accompany the principal characters as they make their entrances and exits. * Les √âgar√©s: Lost individuals who gather together in the streets and abandoned buildings of Quidam. Many of them perform in the banquine act. ** Boum-Boum: A pale skinned, bald character who wears boxing gloves. Enjoys screaming at the audience and walking away proudly, but will run away if an audience member screams back. He is aggressive and physically fit, yet extremely lifeless. It is as though his body lives on only because his soul refuses to leave it. ** Aviator: This character runs around on stage with skeletal wings, but doesn‚Äôt look quite ready to take off. Perhaps he doesn‚Äôt know he has wings. Perhaps he knows, but can‚Äôt fly. Perhaps, like Icarus, he has tried and failed or perhaps he simply wants to escape this world and its problems. ** Homme Ray√©: Translating into English as the 'Striped man' due to his blue and red costume with white stripes. He is one of Les √âgar√©s who has a scarred face. ** Pierrot: Another of Les √âgar√©s who is most noticeable when running across the stage in a long white gown and she has bright red hair. ** Kangaroo: A character representing the youth in society, he wears a blue, sleeveless hood and is one of Les √âgar√©s. ** Blue Lady: A pale skin lady, always spinning on herself. ** La Gar√ßonne: One of Les √âgar√©s, she is dressed in red and love skipping all the time. ** Skipping Girl: One of Les √âgar√©s, she is dressed in blue and love skipping all the time. ** Ballerina: A strange character, he is dress with a tutu. ** The Explorer ** Rescap√© ** Romantic ** Jujube ** Oubli√© ** La Mouche: An upbeat character that makes up Les √âgar√©s, she is dressed entirely in light blue and green. ** Funny Bunny/Peau D'ane: A character who chases and gets chased by other characters. A genius in ecology, lovey-dovey, and astrology. She is one of Les √âgar√©s and is noticeable as a red rabbit on stage. * Les Macloma: A trio of Strange clowns who like to make mischief whenever they can. (1996-1997,1999-2004) * Les Fr√®res Velasquez: Les Macloma's understudies during the Second North American Tour. (2002-2003) * Les Don Quijoles: Les Macloma's understudies during the First Japanese Tour. (2003-2004) * Kotini Jr & Alosha: A duo of clowns that included Kotini Jr., (Portrayed by Konstantin W√ºbbe), and Alosha, (Portrayed by Alexey Mironov) who are both opposites of each other, one is absent-minded, while the other is downright gloomy. (1997-1998) * Toto & Voki: A duo of clowns who like to play with audience members expectations in delightfully bizarre skits previously done by David Shiner. (2004-2016) Acts Quidam combines a mix of acrobatic skills and traditional circus acts: * German Wheel: An acrobat performs tricks within a German wheel, also known as Rh√∂nrad * Diabolo: Originally performed by four girls and later as a solo act, the performer manipulates up to 3 diabolos (i.e. Chinese yo-yo) at once. A diabolo is a wooden spool balance juggled by two sticks linked with a string. * Clown Car: Toto flirts with a female audience member in an invisible car * Aerial contortion in silk: Intensity, power and grace combine when a young woman becomes one with the column of red fabric which supports and cradles her. * Skipping ropes: Drawing inspiration from dance, acrobatics, and the art of manipulation, a group of 20 acrobats performs this familiar child's game in a steady stream of solo, duo, and group jumps and figures. * Aerial hoops: Three performers use hoops attached to the ceiling to perform tricks. * Handbalancing: Using strength and balance, a performer contorts into poses while on balancing canes. * Spanish web: Artists fly over the stage, attached to trolleys on the overhead tracks. In turn or as a group, they occasionally perform a sudden drop, stopped only by the ropes looped around their waists or ankles. * Statue: Never losing contact, two strong, flexible performers move almost imperceptibly, assuming positions impossible without an impeccable sense of balance. * Clown Movie: The clown directs a comedic skit using audience members as actors. A similar version was performed in Nouvelle Experience * Banquine: An Italian acrobatic tradition going back to the Middle Ages that combines gymnastics and ballet. Showcasing the agility of the human body, up to 15 artists perform sequences of feats and human pyramids with their perfectly synchronized movements. =Acts in rotation= * Juggling: Up to five balls fly through the air, with additional manipulation of a briefcase, umbrella, and bowler hat. * Dance Trapeze: A solo trapeze artist twirls over the stage on a trapeze strung from the telepherique. =Retired acts= * Cyr wheel: An acrobat performed tricks within a large metal ring. This act replaced German Wheel between 2012 and 2013. * Manipulation: Three performers used warped metal sheets to juggle and manipulate a red ball that they each had; later in the act, they got rid of the metal sheet and juggled the red balls as well as many other red balls and a bowler hat each. This act was removed in 1998. * Solo Aerial straps: A male single artist grasped cords that dangled from the overhead rails; sometimes he performed on the ground, sometimes in the air. This act was in rotation, and was performed in 1997 in replacement of the German Wheel act in very rare circumstances. * Duo Aerial straps: Two artists grasped cords that dangled from the overhead rails; sometimes they performed on the ground, sometimes in the air. This act was performed during the Asia Pacific tour of 2004 - 2005. * Hoops: A performer spun and manipulated up to 20 spinning hoops all over her body. This act was performed in place of Handbalancing in 2002 and 2008. * Cloud swing: A unique combination of swinging trapeze and Spanish web techniques. This act was dropped from the show in 2012 due to issues with finance, and a single trapeze act temporarily replaced it. The cloud swing act returned to the show from 2012 to 2013 and during the Seoul, South Korea tour in 2015 because the promoter wanted to make the show as close to the original as possible during its final run under the Grand Chapiteau. * Duplex trapeze: A performer did tricks on a two tiered trapeze. This act was a temporary replacement for the cloud swing act in 2012. * Macloma: The Macloma's mess with audience members. * Montgolfiere: The Macloma's play in hot air balloons. * Balloon Song: The Macloma's play a song with balloons and a broken violin. * Hose: Alosha entertains the audience with a long rubber hose. * Dance: Kotini Jr performs a dance with a chair. =Awards= Quidam's diabolo act won a Gold Medal at the 1995 Festival du Cirque de Demain. The show's banquine act won the Golden Clown at the 1999 International Monte Carlo Circus Festival. Costumes Quidam's costume designer, Dominique Lemieux, drew inspiration from Surrealist art, particularly the works of Ren√© Magritte and Paul Delvaux. The costumes convey the alienation of the characters and represent an urban landscape through the use of painted textures and fabrics. The dominant color is grey but is supplemented by deep, rich, warm colors and embellished with metals. Quidam was the first Cirque du Soleil show to use everyday clothing for the outfits, although those in the acrobatic acts are modified. The fabric chosen for Quidam is primarily stretch linen, but also includes leather, jute, linen crepe, wool, velvet and 42 types of cotton. Quidam has approximately 249 costumes, 500 costume accessories, and 200-300 shoes: Each artist has anywhere from 2 to 7 costumes, of which there are at least 2 spares. The costumes, although washed every day, can last anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. Music Quidam‚Äôs music was composed by Beno√Æt Jutras and has been released in three album editions featuring additional songs, alternative new cover designs, and higher quality sounds. The first CD was produced by Carl Marsh. It was co-arranged by Marsh and Jutras and released on January 14, 1997. () The album features the voices of Audrey Brisson-Jutras and Mathieu Lavoie, with the exception of two bonus tracks sung by Brisson-Jutras and Richard Price on the extended CD released in 2001 (recorded live in Amsterdam, 1999). Below is a list of tracks as featured on the original 1997 release, alongside each of which is listed the act that the track accompanies.

For a short time in 2009, Quidam toured the UK and IE in arena format before switching back to the Grand Chapiteau for its South America tour. After this, in 2010, Quidam was converted into the arena format where it began a North American, European and Asia-Pacific tour. However, during its run in Seoul in 2015, Quidam was temporarily reconverted to play under the Grand Chapiteau for three months before continuing its farewell tour in the arena format for its run in Australia and New Zealand. The show's 20-year tour visited 241 cities in 42 countries before it ended on February 26, 2016 in Christchurch, New Zealand. Cirque du Soleil started using a customized tour bus as a method of helping to advertise Quidam during its tour in northeastern North America during the fall of 2011. During the show's stops in cities, the tour bus makes appearances at local merchants, allowing people to meet part of the crew.

He escapes and returns home to his mother, who puts him to bed after offering him chamomile- tea. The tale was written for five-year-old Noel Moore, son of Potter's former governess Annie Carter Moore, in 1893. It was revised and privately printed by Potter in 1901 after several publishers' rejections, but was printed in a trade edition by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1902. The book was a success, and multiple reprints were issued in the years immediately following its debut. It has been translated into 36 languages, and with 45 million copies sold it is one of the best-selling books in history.Worker's Press Since its release, the book has generated considerable merchandise for both children and adults, including toys, dishes, foods, clothing, and videos. Potter was one of the first to be responsible for such merchandise when she patented a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903 and followed it almost immediately with a Peter Rabbit board game. Peter Rabbit has remained popular amongst children for more than a century and continues to be adapted and expanded through new book editions, television and film. Plot The story focuses on a family of anthropomorphic rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit warns her four rabbit children, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, and Peter (the youngest rabbit child) not to enter the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, whose wife, she tells them, put their father in a pie after he entered. Her triplets (Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail) obediently refrain from entering the garden. Peter's older sisters (Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail) were good little bunnies and went down the lane to gather blackberries. But Peter enters the garden to snack on some vegetables. Peter ends up eating more than what is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty, he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's scarecrow for crows and other pesky critters. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, after she tells him that his jacket and shoes are the second jacket and pair of shoes that he has lost in a fortnight. His mother also takes note that he was not feeling too well, and deduces that he had definitely been to Mr McGregor's garden. To cure his stomachache, Mrs. Rabbit gives him chamomile-tea which is revealed to be one teaspoon and gives a dose of it to Peter. Peter's older sisters (Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail), meanwhile, receive a scrumptious dinner of milk, bread and blackberries. However, only Mr. McGregor knew where Peter's clothes were as they were used to frighten the crows like a scarecrow. Composition The story was inspired by a pet rabbit Potter had as a child, which she named Peter Piper. Through the 1890s, Potter sent illustrated story letters to the children of her former governess, Annie Moore. In 1900, Moore, realizing the commercial potential of Potter's stories, suggested they be made into books. Potter embraced the suggestion, and, borrowing her complete correspondence (which had been carefully preserved by the Moore children), selected a letter written on 4 September 1893 to five-year-old Noel that featured a tale about a rabbit named Peter. Potter biographer Linda Lear explains: \\"The original letter was too short to make a proper book so [Potter] added some text and made new black-and-white illustrations...and made it more suspenseful. These changes slowed the narrative down, added intrigue, and gave a greater sense of the passage of time. Then she copied it out into a stiff-covered exercise book, and painted a coloured frontispiece showing Mrs Rabbit dosing Peter with chamomile-tea\\". Publication history =Private publication= Cover of the 1901 privately published edition As Lear explains, Potter titled The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden and sent it to publishers, but \\"her manuscript was returned ... including Frederick Warne & Co. ... who nearly a decade earlier had shown some interest in her artwork. Some publishers wanted a shorter book, others a longer one. But most wanted coloured illustrations which by 1900 were both popular and affordable\\". The several rejections were frustrating to Potter, who knew exactly how her book should look (she had adopted the format and style of Helen Bannerman's Little Black Sambo) \\"and how much it should cost\\". She decided to publish the book herself, and on 16 December 1901 the first 250 copies of her privately printed The Tale of Peter Rabbit were \\"ready for distribution to family and friends\\". =First commercial edition= In 1901, as Lear explains, a Potter family friend and sometime poet, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, set Potter's tale into \\"rather dreadful didactic verse and submitted it, along with Potter's illustrations and half her revised manuscript, to Frederick Warne & Co.,\\" who had been among the original rejecters. Warne editors declined Rawnsley's version \\"but asked to see the complete Potter manuscript\\" ‚Äì their interest stimulated by the opportunity The Tale of Peter Rabbit offered the publisher to compete with the success of Helen Bannerman's wildly popular Little Black Sambo and other small-format children's books then on the market. When Warne inquired about the lack of colour illustrations in the book, Potter replied that rabbit-brown and green were not good subjects for colouration. Warne declined the book but left open the possibility of future publication. Warne wanted colour illustrations throughout the \\"bunny book\\" (as the firm referred to the tale) and suggested cutting the illustrations \\"from forty-two to thirty-two ... and marked which ones might best be eliminated\\". Potter initially resisted the idea of colour illustrations, but then realized her stubborn stance was a mistake. She sent Warne \\"several colour illustrations, along with a copy of her privately printed edition\\" which Warne then handed to their eminent children's book illustrator L. Leslie Brooke for his professional opinion. Brooke was impressed with Potter's work. Fortuitously, his recommendation coincided with a sudden surge in the small picture-book market. Meanwhile, Potter continued to distribute her privately printed edition to family and friends, with the celebrated creator of Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle, acquiring a copy for his children. When the first private printing of 250 copies was sold out, another 200 were prepared. She noted in an inscription in one copy that her beloved pet rabbit Peter had died. Potter arrived at an agreement with Warne for an initial commercial publication of 5,000 copies. Negotiations dragged on into the following year, but a contract was finally signed in June 1902. Potter was closely involved in the publication of the commercial edition ‚Äì redrawing where necessary, making minor adjustments to the prose and correcting punctuation. The blocks for the illustrations and text were sent to printer Edmund Evans for engraving, and she made adjustments to the proofs when she received them. Lear writes that \\"Even before the publication of the tale in early October 1902, the first 8,000 copies were sold out. By the year's end there were 28,000 copies of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in print. By the middle of 1903 there was a fifth edition sporting coloured endpapers ... a sixth printing was produced within the month\\"; and a year after the first commercial publication there were 56,470 copies in print. =American copyright= Warne's New York office \\"failed to register the copyright for The Tale of Peter Rabbit in the United States\\", and unlicensed copies of the book \\"(from which Potter would receive no royalties) began to appear in the spring of 1903. There was nothing anyone could do to stop them\\". The enormous financial loss \\"... [to Potter] only became evident over time\\". The necessity of protecting her intellectual property hit home after the successful 1903 publication of The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin when her father returned from Burlington Arcade in Mayfair at Christmas 1903 with a toy squirrel labelled \\"Nutkin\\". Merchandising Peter feasts on Mr. McGregor's vegetables Potter asserted that her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the \\"longevity of her books comes from strategy\\", writes Potter biographer Ruth MacDonald.MacDonald 1986, p. 128 She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales; between 1903 and 1905 these included a Peter Rabbit stuffed toy, an unpublished board game, and nursery wallpaper.Lear 2008, pp. 172‚Äì5 Considerable variations to the original format and version of The Tale of Peter Rabbit, as well as spin-off merchandise, have been made available over the decades. Variant versions include \\"pop-ups, toy theatres, and lift-the-flap books\\". By 1998, modern technology had made available \\"videos, audio cassette, a CD-ROM, a computer program, and Internet sites\\", as described by Margaret Mackey writing in The case of Peter Rabbit: changing conditions of literature for children. She continues: \\"Warne and their collaborators and competitors have produced a large collection of activity books and a monthly educational magazine\\". A plethora of other Peter Rabbit related merchandise exists, and \\"toy shops in the United States and Britain have whole sections of [the] store specially signposted and earmarked exclusively for Potter-related toys and merchandise\\". Unauthorized copying of The Tale of Peter Rabbit has flourished over the decades, including products only loosely associated with the original. In 1916, American Louise A. Field cashed in on the popularity by writing books such as Peter Rabbit Goes to School and Peter Rabbit and His Ma, the illustrations of which showed him in his distinctive blue jacket. In an animated movie by Golden Films, The New Adventures of Peter Rabbit, \\"Peter is given buck teeth, an American accent and a fourth sister Hopsy.\\" Another video \\"retelling of the tale casts Peter as a Christian preacher singing songs about God and Jesus.\\" Literary praise Writing in Storyteller: The Classic that Heralded America's Storytelling Revival, in discussing the difference between stories that lend themselves well to telling and stories that lend themselves well to reading, Ramon Ross explains Peter Rabbit is a story created for reading. He believes Potter created a good mix of suspense and tension, intermixed with lulls in the action. He goes on to write that the writing style‚Äî\\"the economy of words, the crisp writing\\"‚Äîlends itself well to a young audience. Lear writes that Potter \\"had in fact created a new form of animal fable in: one in which anthropomorphic animals behave as real animals with true animal instincts\\", and a form of fable with anatomically correct illustrations drawn by a scientifically minded artist. She further states Peter Rabbit's nature is familiar to rabbit enthusiasts \\"and endorsed by those who are not ... because her portrayal speaks to some universal understanding of rabbity behaviour.\\" She describes the tale as a \\"perfect marriage of word and image\\" and \\"a triumph of fantasy and fact\\". Mr. McGregor tries to trap Peter under a garden sieve According to Stuart Jeffries, \\"...psychoanalytic critiques of her work have multiplied since her death in 1943.\\"Jeffries, Stuart. \\"The ugly truth about Peter Rabbit ...\\", The Guardian, December 7, 2006 Carole Scott writes in Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit that the reader cannot help but identify with rebellious little Peter and his plight as all the illustrations are presented from his low-to-the-ground view, most feature Peter in close-up and within touching distance, and Mr. McGregor is distanced from the reader by always being depicted on the far side of Peter. Scott explains: \\"This identification dramatically instills fear and tension in the reader, and interacts with the frequently distanced voice of the verbal narrative\\", sometimes with contradictory effects. In the verbal narrative and the illustration for the moment when Mr. McGregor attempts to trap Peter under a garden sieve, for example, the verbal narrative presents the murderous intent of Mr. McGregor as a matter-of-fact, everyday occurrence while the illustration presents the desperate moment from the terrified view of a small animal in fear of his life ‚Äì a view that is reinforced by the birds that take flight to the left and the right. In the illustration of Peter standing by the locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident in the moment of the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, \\"Peter began to cry\\" is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter's emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader's identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony. Scott suggests Potter's tale has encouraged many generations of children to \\"self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living.\\" Frank Delaney notes \\"a self-containment\\" in Potter's writing reflective of an uninterested mother and a lonely childhood spent in the company of pets.Delaney, Frank. \\"The Tale of Beatrix Potter\\", The public Domain Review John Bidwell, curator at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, observed \\"...the sardonic humor that makes Beatrix Potter so much fun for kids and grown-ups.\\"Chozick, Amy. \\"Bet Your Camomile Tea, Peter, You‚Äôre a TV Star Now\\", The New York Times, December 5, 2012  Adaptations  In 1938, shortly after the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Walt Disney became interested in making an animated film based on The Tale of Peter Rabbit. However, in a letter to a friend, Potter wrote that she refused Walt Disney's \\"scheme to film Peter Rabbit\\", saying, \\"I am not very hopeful about the result. They propose to use cartoons; it seems that a succession of figures can be joggled together to give an impression of motion. I don't think the pictures would be satisfactory... I am not troubling myself about it!\\" In 1935, the story was loosely adapted in the Merrie Melodies short film, Country Boy. It shows some modifications in relation to Beatrix Potter's original story, most notably the Rabbit family surname is changed to \\"Cottontail\\" and Peter having two brothers and a sister rather than 3 sisters. In 1971, Peter Rabbit appeared as a character in the ballet film The Tales of Beatrix Potter. In late 1991, HBO aired an animated musical adaptation of The Tale of Peter Rabbit, narrated by Carol Burnett, as part of the network's Storybook Musicals series, which was later released to VHS by Family Home Entertainment under HBO licence.Peter Rabbit 1991 (TCM) In 1992, the tale was adapted to animation again for the BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends, along with The Tale of Benjamin Bunny. In 2006, Peter Rabbit was heavily referenced in a biopic about Beatrix Potter entitled Miss Potter. In December 2012, a new CGI-animated children's TV series titled Peter Rabbit premiered on Nickelodeon, with a full series run beginning in February 2013. Peter was voiced by Colin DePaula throughout Season 1 and recanted by L. Parker Lucas for Season 2 in the US version. In the U.K. version he is voiced by Connor Fitzgerald. In February 2018, a 3D live-action/CGI animated feature film titled Peter Rabbit, directed by Will Gluck, was released. Voice roles were played by James Corden, Daisy Ridley, Margot Robbie, and Elizabeth Debicki, and live action roles played by Domhnall Gleeson, Rose Byrne, and Sam Neill. A sequel is set to be released in 2021.

Life and career Born David Berlizheimer of Jewish parents in M√ºhringen, W√ºrttemberg, Germany, Adolf J. Schmid: ‚ÄûD.‚Äú und der Mythos der Delphine - Maximilian D. Berlitz = David Berlizheimer, in: ‚ÄûSchw√§bische Heimat‚Äú, Jahrgang 2001/1, S. 44 ff., Stuttgart, Germany he and his sister were soon orphaned, and he grew up in a family of educators in the Black Forest. Berlitz was required by law to serve as an apprentice; he chose to work for a watchmaker for three years. He later relocated to France and then to Providence, Rhode Island, United States in 1872. His first employment was as a teacher of French and German at Warner Polytechnic College, of which he assumed control in 1878 when the owner of the school, Mr. Warner, disappeared with all the prepaid tuition money. When Berlitz became ill, and was unable to teach a French class, he quickly hired Nicholas Joly to replace him and teach the class. Since he had always corresponded with Joly in French, he did not realize that Joly did not speak any English until after he had hired him. Joly taught the class entirely in French (with no translation) by using gestures, pointing to objects and using tone of voice and facial expressions to convey meaning. Berlitz returned to the class six weeks later to find that his students, who had spoken little to no French before Joly began teaching, were conversing semi-fluently in French. Their pronunciation and grammar were also very good. Berlitz used this experience to develop the Berlitz Method, for which only the language to be taught is spoken from the first day of class. Students rely on the same techniques Joly used, rather than translation, to gather meaning and learn grammar and vocabulary. After success, Berlitz opened a second language school in Boston in 1880, supplemented by others in New York and Washington, D. C. He went on to establish schools all over the U.S. and in many countries abroad. Between 1880 and 1900 he also began writing about his ideas, developing them into a systematic method, which he then presented in 1900 at the World's Fair in Paris. After the end of the century, he began travelling extensively, making headlines by teaching German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II to speak English. Berlitz's fame continued to spread as he received medals of honor from the King of Spain, the government of France, and from many international expositions. He remained active until his death, aged 68, in New York City. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York. Mr. Berlitz's method of language learning is still used. Many books that were originally published during the early- to mid-1900s are still in print. There are also many schools that are still dedicated to continuing Berlitz's concepts regarding language learning. The linguist and author Charles Berlitz, his grandson, was for a time the CEO of Berlitz International.

Many of these activities are also prohibited on the Jewish holidays listed in the Torah, although there are significant exceptions that permit carrying and preparing food under specific circumstances on holidays. In addition to the 39 melachot, certain other activities are forbidden on Shabbat due to rabbinic law. There are often disagreements between Orthodox Jews and Conservative Jews or other non- Orthodox Jews as to the practical observance of Shabbat. It is of note that the (strict) observance of Shabbat is often seen as a benchmark for orthodoxy and indeed has legal bearing on the way a Jew is seen by an orthodox religious court regarding their affiliation to Judaism. The commandment The commandment to keep Shabbat as a day of rest is repeated many times in the Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible. Its importance is also stressed in : Meaning of \\"work\\" Though melakha is usually translated as \\"work\\" in English, the term does not correspond to the English definition of the term, as explained below. The rabbis in ancient times had to explain exactly what the term meant, and what activity was prohibited to be done on the Sabbath. The rabbis noted : :Heaven and earth, and all their components, were completed. With the seventh day, God finished all the work [melakha] that He had done. He ceased on the seventh day from all the work [melakha] that he had been doing. God blessed the seventh day, and he declared it to be holy, for it was on this day that God ceased from all the work [melakha] that he had been creating to function. Specifically, the rabbis noted the symmetry between Genesis 2:1‚Äì3 and Exodus 31:1‚Äì11 ‚Äì the same term melakha [\\"work\\"] is used in both places, and that in Genesis 2:1‚Äì3 what God was \\"ceasing from\\" was \\"creation\\" or \\"creating\\". The rabbis noted further that the first part of provides detailed instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle, and that it is immediately followed by a reminder to Moses about the importance of the Shabbat, quoted above. The rabbis note that in the provisions relating to the Tabernacle the word melakha is also used. The word is usually translated as \\"workmanship\\", which has a strong element of \\"creation\\" or \\"creativity\\". From these common words (in the Hebrew original) and the juxtaposition of subject matter the rabbis of the Mishnah derive a meaning as to which activities are prohibited to be done on the Sabbath day. is not pushed aside by the commandments to construct the Tabernacle. The classical rabbinical definition of what constitutes \\"work\\" or \\"activity\\" that must not be done, on pain of death (when there was a Sanhedrin), is depicted by the thirty-nine categories of activity needed for the construction and use of the Tabernacle. Definition The thirty-nine melakhot are not so much activities as categories of activity. For example, while \\"winnowing\\" usually refers exclusively to the separation of chaff from grain, it refers in the Talmudic sense to any separation of intermixed materials which renders edible that which was inedible. Thus, filtering undrinkable water to make it drinkable falls under this category, as does picking small bones from fish. (Gefilte fish is a traditional Ashkenazi solution to this problem.) Many rabbinical scholars have pointed out that these regulations of labor have something in common ‚Äì they prohibit any activity that is creative, or that exercises control or dominion over one's environment. The definitions presented in this article are only 'headings' for in-depth topics and without study of the relevant laws it would be very difficult, perhaps impossible, to properly keep the Sabbath according to Halacha/Jewish Law. Groups There are two main ways to divide the activities into groups, one is according to the work needed to make the Tabernacle, the other according to the work needed for the man himself. * For the Tabernacle: *# Making the paint for the fabric coverings and curtains *# Making the coverings *# Making coverings from skin *# Making the Tabernacle itself * For the man: *# Baking bread *# Making clothes *# Writing *# Building a house The thirty-nine creative activities The 39 melachot are discussed in the Talmud in tractate Shabbat. As listed in the Mishna (Shabbat 7:2), they are as follows: Transferring Between Domains (see below) and preparing food are permitted on Jewish holidays. These are the only exceptions to the rule that activities prohibited on the Sabbath are likewise prohibited on holidays. Note: The thirty-nine prohibited activities are bolded. =The Order of Bread= Planting Hebrew: (Zorea) Definition: Promotion of plant growth. Not only planting is included in this category; other activities that promote plant growth are also prohibited. This includes watering, fertilizing, planting seeds, or planting grown plants. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 8:2, 21:5; Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 336; Chayei Adam Shabbos 11 Plowing Hebrew: (·∏§oresh) Definition: Promotion of substrate in readiness for plant growth, be it soil, water for hydroponics, etc. Included in this prohibition is any preparation or improvement of land for agricultural use. This includes dragging chair legs in soft soil thereby unintentionally making furrows, or pouring water on arable land that is not saturated. Making a hole in the soil would also provide protection for a seed placed there from rain and runoff; even if no seed is ever placed there, the soil is now enhanced for the process of planting. The Mishna (Shabbat 7:2) lists plowing after planting, although one must plow a field before planting. The Gemara asks why this order occurs and answers that the author of this Mishna was a Tanna living in the Land of Israel, where the ground is hard. Since the ground is so hard in Israel, it needed to be plowed both before planting and after planting. The Mishna lists plowing second, teaching that the second plowing (after planting) is [also] prohibited. (The plowing before the planting is also prohibited, if not biblically, certainly rabbinically). The Rambam lists plowing first, and planting second. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 7:3, 8:1, 21:2‚Äì4; Chayei Adam Shabbos 10 Reaping Hebrew: (Ko·π£er) Definition: Severing a plant from its source of growth. Removing all or part of a plant from its source of growth is reaping. Climbing a tree is rabbinically forbidden, for fear this may lead to one tearing off a branch. Riding an animal is also rabbinically forbidden, as one may unthinkingly detach a stick with which to hit the animal. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 8:3‚Äì5, 21:6‚Äì10; Chayei Adam Shabbos 12 Gathering Hebrew: (Me'amer) Definition: Initial gathering of earth-borne/organic material in its original place. E.g. After picking strawberries, forming a pile or collecting them into one's pockets, or a basket. Collecting rock salt or any mineral (from a mine or from the Earth) and making a pile of the produce. This can only occur in the place where the gathering should take place. So, a bowl of apples that falls in a house can be gathered as 1) they do not grow in that environment and 2) they were already initially gathered in the orchard. However, subsequent gathering, which improves the object(s) affected is included in this law. For example, stringing diamonds together to form a necklace is a significant improvement of their gathered status. This may well extend to pearls as well. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 8:5, 21:11; Chayei Adam Shabbos 13 Threshing/Extraction Hebrew: (Dosh) Definition: Removal of an undesirable outer from a desirable inner. This is a large topic of study. It refers to any productive Extraction and includes juicing fruits and vegetables and wringing (desirable fluids) out of cloths, as the juice or water inside the fruit is considered 'desirable' for these purposes, while the pulp of the fruit would be the 'undesirable.' As such, squeezing (S'·∏•ita) is forbidden unless certain rules are applied. The wringing of undesirable water out of cloths may come under Scouring/Laundering. This activity could be viewed as extraction, while Sorting (see below) is more akin to purification. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 8:7‚Äì10, 21:12‚Äì16;Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 319‚Äì321; Chayei Adam Shabbos 14 Winnowing Hebrew: (Zoreh) Definition: Sorting undesirable from desirable via the force of air (Babylonian Talmud), or dispersal via the force of air (Jerusalem Talmud). In the Babylonian Talmud this refers exclusively to an act of separation, for example, chaff from grain ‚Äì i.e. to any separation of intermixed materials. Example: If one has a handful of peanuts, in their paper-thin brown skins, and one blows on the mixture of peanuts and skins, dispersing the unwanted skins from the peanuts, this would be an act of Winnowing according to both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud. The Jerusalem Talmud has a more inclusive and general definition of Zoreh. By this definition, use of the Venturi tube spray system and spray painting would come under this prohibition, while butane or propane propelled sprays (common in deodorants and air fresheners, etc.) are permissible to operate as the dispersal force generated isn't from air, rather from the propellant within the can. According to the Babylonian Talmud's definition, neither of the above spraying methods is involved in sorting undesirable from desirable and therefore not part of this heading. Rabbi Moses Isserles (the Rema) holds that, unusually, the Jerusalem Talmud's definition should also be taken into account. As there's no argument between the Rema and the Beit Yosef on this point, Ashkenazi and Sefardic Jews do not disagree with the Rema's extended inclusion of the Jerusalem Talmud's definition in this case. See further: Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 219:7; Chayei Adam Shabbos 15. Sorting/Purification Hebrew: (Borer) Definition: Removal of undesirable from desirable from a mixture of types. In the Talmudic sense usually refers exclusively to the separation of debris from grain ‚Äì i.e. to any separation of intermixed materials which renders edible that which was inedible. Thus, filtering undrinkable water to make it drinkable falls under this category, as does picking small bones from fish. (Gefilte fish is one solution to this problem.) Sorting/Purification differs from Threshing/Extraction as here there is a _mixture of types_ , and sorting a mixture via the removal of undesirable elements leaves a purified, refined component. In contrast, Threshing/Extraction does not entail sorting or purification, just extraction of the inner from the unwanted housing or outer component, such as squeezing a grape for its juice. The juice and the pulp have not undergone sorting, the juice has been extracted from the pulp. For example, if there is a bowl of mixed peanuts and raisins, and one desires the raisins and dislikes the peanuts: Removing (effectively sorting) the peanuts from the bowl, leaving a 'purified' pile of raisins free from unwanted peanuts, would be Sorting/Purification as the peanuts are removed. However, removing the desirable raisins from the peanuts does not purify the mixture, as one is left with undesirable peanuts (hence unrefined) not a refined component as before, and is thus permissible. Note that in this case there has not been any extraction of material from either the peanuts or raisins (Threshing/Extraction), just the sorting of undesirable from desirable (Sorting/Purification). General Introduction: :After threshing, a mixed collection of waste matter remained on the threshing floor together with the grain kernels. Included in this combination would be small pebbles and similar debris. :These pebbles could not be separated by winnowing because they were too heavy to be carried by the wind. The pebbles and debris were therefore sorted and removed by hand. This process is Sorting/Purification. :Any form of selecting from (or sorting of) an assorted mixture or combination can be borer. This includes removing undesired objects, or matter from a mixture or combination. Borer with Mixed Foods: :Even though the classic form of borer as performed in the Mishkan involved the removal of pebbles and similar waste matter from the grain produce, Sorting/Purification is by no means limited to the removal of ‚Äúuseless‚Äù matter from food. In fact, any selective removal from a mixture can, indeed, be Sorting/Purification, even if the mixture contains an assortment of foods. The criteria are types and desire, not intrinsic value. Therefore, removing any food or item from a mix of different types of foods simply because he does not desire the item at that time is considered Sorting/Purification. The Three Conditions of Sorting/Purification: :Sorting/Purification is permitted when three conditions are fulfilled simultaneously. It is absolutely imperative that all three conditions be present while Sorting/Purifying # B‚Äôyad (By hand): The selection must be done by hand and not a utensil that aids in the selection. # O·∏•el Mito·∏• Psolet (Good from the bad): The desired objects must be selected from the undesired, and not the reverse. # Miyad (Immediate use): The selection must be done immediately before the time of use and not for later use. There is no precise amount of time indicated by the concept of \\"immediate use\\" (miyad). The criteria used to define \\"immediate use\\" relate to the circumstances. For instance if a particular individual prepares food for a meal rather slowly, that individual may allow a more liberal amount of time in which to do so without having transgressed \\"borer.\\" Examples of Permissible and Prohibited Types of Sorting/Purification: # Peeling fruits: Peeling fruits is permissible with the understanding that the fruit will be eaten right away. # Sorting silverware: Sorting silverware is permitted when the sorter intends to eat the Sabbath meal immediately. Alternatively, if the sorter intends to set up the meal for a later point, it is prohibited. # Removing items from a mixture: If the desired item is being removed from the mix then this is permissible. If the non-desired item is being removed, the person removing is committing a serious transgression according to the laws of the Sabbath.

Dissection Hebrew: (To·∏•en) Definition: Reducing an earth-borne thing's size for a productive purpose. Dissection can arise in simply cutting into pieces fruits or vegetables for a salad. Very small pieces would involve Dissection, therefore cutting into slightly larger than usual pieces would be permitted, thus avoiding cutting the pieces into their final, most usable, state. All laws relating to the use of medicine on the Sabbath are a toldah, or sub-category, of this order, as most medicines require pulverization at some point and thus are Dissected. The laws of medicine use on the Sabbath are complex; they are based around the kind of illness the patient is suffering from and the type of medication or procedure that is required. Generally, the more severe the illness (from a hala·∏•ic perspective) the further into the list the patient's situation is classed. As a patient is classed as more ill there are fewer restrictions and greater leniencies available for treating the illness on the Sabbath. The list of definitions, from least to most severe, is as follows: # / May·∏•ush b'Alma / Minor Indisposition # / Mik·π£at ·∏§oli / Semi-illness # / ·π¢a'ar Gadol / Severe Pain (Can in some cases be practically regarded as level 4) # / ·∏§oleh Kol Gufo / Debilitating Illness # / Sakanat Aiver / Threat to a Limb or Organ (Can in some cases be practically regarded as level 6) # / Sofek Pikua·∏• Nefesh / Possibly Life-Threatening (Practically treated as level 7) # / Pikua·∏• Nefesh / Certainly Life-Threatening For most practical applications the use of medicines on the Sabbath, there are primarily two categories of non-life- threatening (Pikua·∏• Nefesh) illnesses and maladies. They are either May·∏•ush b'Alma or ·∏§oleh Kol Gufo. In many or most practical applications for non- trained personnel, there are practically only three category levels (1, 4, & 7) as the line of distinction between them can often be difficult to ascertain for the untrained and it may prove dangerous to underestimate the condition. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 8:15, 21:18‚Äì31; Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 321; Chayei Adam Shabbos 17 Sifting Hebrew: (Merakaid) Definition: Sorting desirable from undesirable by means of a utensil (designed for sifting or sorting). This is essentially the same as Sorting/Purification (see above), but performed with a utensil specifically designed for the purpose of sorting, such as a sieve, strainer, or the like. As such, Sorting/Purifying with such a device, such as the netting of a tea bag, would be classed as an act of sifting. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 8:14, 21:32; Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 321, 324; Chayei Adam Shabbos 18 Kneading/Amalgamation Hebrew: (Losh) Definition: Combining particles into a semi-solid or solid mass via liquid. The accepted description of this category, translating to \\"Kneading\\", is inaccurate. More precisely, this prohibited activity is Amalgamation or combining solid and liquid together to form a paste or dough-like substance. There are four categories of produced substances: # Blilah Avah (a thick, dense mixture) # Blilah Ra·∏•a (a thinner, pourable mixture) # Davar Nozel (a pourable liquid with a similar viscosity to water) # ·∏§ati·∏•ot Gedolot (large pieces mixed with a liquid) Only producing a Blilah Avah is biblically forbidden. A Blilah Ra·∏•a mixture is rabbinically forbidden, but may be produced by using a shinui (unusual mode), such as the reversing the adding of the ingredients, or mixing in crisscross rather than circular motions. As Davar Nozel and ·∏§ati·∏•ot Gedolot are not really mixtures, even after adding the liquid to the solid, making them is permitted even without a shinui. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 8:16, 21:33‚Äì36; Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 321,324; Chayei Adam Shabbos 19 Cooking/Baking Hebrew: (Bishul/Ofeh) Definition for _solids_ : Changing the properties of something via heat. Definition for _liquids_ : Bringing a liquid's temperature to the heat threshold. This threshold is known as yad soledet (lit. \\"A hand reflexively recoils [due to such heat]\\"). According to Igrot Moshe (Rabbi Moshe Feinstein) this temperature is . (Note, however, that Cooking/Baking is permitted on Jewish holidays. It is an exception to the rule that activities prohibited on the Sabbath are likewise prohibited on holidays.) Any method of heating food to prepare for eating is included in this prohibition. This is different from \\"preparing\\". For example, a salad can be made because the form of the vegetables doesn't change, only the size. However, the vegetables may not be Cooked to soften them for eating. Baking was performed in the Mishkan as showbreads were continually required. However, they were not required for the structure. Some opine baking is listed regarding the preparation of the dyes used for the tapestries.

Merely enriching a color already present, such as applying clear gloss to wood or a fingernail, thus enriching is colour/appearance, would transgress the scriptural law. (This may also present issues of Fine-Tuning/Perfecting, as well). There may be an exemption for foods as they aren't considered permanent. However, aesthetically coloring foods for decoration, such as in a sugar sculpture, is included.

See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 10:9, 11; Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 340; Chayei Adam Shabbos 28 Tearing Hebrew: (Kore'a) Definition: Ripping an object in two or undoing any sewn (see Sewing) connection. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 10:10; Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 340; Chayei Adam Shabbos 29, Shabbos 7 =The Order of Hides= Trapping Hebrew: (·π¢od) Definition: Forcible confinement of a living creature. The Mishna does not just write \\"trapping\\"; rather, the Mishna says \\"trapping deer\\". According to at least one interpretation, this teaches that to violate the Torah's prohibition of Trapping, two conditions must be met: # The trapped animal must be non- domesticated. # The animal must not be legally confined. For example, closing one's front door, thereby confining insects in one's house is not considered trapping as no difference to the insect's 'trappable' status has occurred. I.e. it was as easy or difficult to trap it now as when the door was open. This creates practical questions such as: \\"May a fly be trapped under a cup on the Sabbath?\\" The Meno Netziv says that an animal that is not normally trapped (e.g. a fly, or a lizard) is not covered under the Torah prohibition of trapping. It is however, a rabbinic prohibition to do so, therefore one is not allowed to trap the animal. However, if one is afraid of the animal because of its venomous nature or that it might have rabies, one may trap it. If life or limb is threatened, it may be trapped and even killed if absolutely necessary. Animals which are considered too slow-moving to be 'free' are not included in this category, as trapping them does not change their legal status of being able to grab them in 'one hand swoop' (a term used by the Rambam to define this law). A snail, tortoise, etc. may therefore be confined as they can be grabbed just as easily whether they are in an enclosure or unhindered in the wild. For these purposes trapping them serves no change to their legal status regarding their 'ease of capture,' and they are termed legally pre-trapped due to their nature. Trapping is therefore seen not as a 'removal of liberty,' which caging even such a slow moving creature would be, but rather the confining of a creature to make it easier to capture in one's hand. Laying traps violates a rabbinic prohibition regardless of what the trap is, as this is a normal method of trapping a creature. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 10:15; Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 317; Chayei Adam Shabbos 30 Killing Hebrew: (Sho·∏•et) Definition: Ending a creature's life, whether through slaughter or any other method. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 11:1‚Äì4; Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 316; Chayei Adam Shabbos 31 Flaying/Skinning Hebrew: (Maphshit) Definition: Removing the hide from the body of a dead animal. (Removing skin from a live creature would fall under Shearing.)

The list of activities in the Mishna includes salting hides and curing as separate categories of activity; the Gemara (Tractate Shabbat 75b) amends this to consider them the same activity and to include \\"tracing lines\\", also involved in the production of leather, as the thirty- ninth category of activity. This activity extends rabbinically to salting/pickling foods for non-immediate use on the Sabbath. See further: Chayei Adam Shabbos 32‚Äì33, Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 321, 327; Chayei Adam Shabbos 33 Smoothing Hebrew: (Mema·∏•ek) Definition: Scraping/sanding a surface to achieve smoothness. See further: Chayei Adam Shabbos 34‚Äì35 Scoring Hebrew: (Mesartet) Definition: Scoring/drawing a cutting guideline. See further: Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Shabbat, Chapter \\"Klall Gadol\\", p. 52\\\\. tirone Measured Cutting Hebrew: (Me·∏•ate·∏•) Definition: Cutting any object to a specific size. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 11:7; Chayei Adam Shabbos 36 = The Order of Construction = Writing Hebrew: (Kotev) Definition: Writing/forming a meaningful character or design. Rabbinically, even writing with one's weaker hand is forbidden. The rabbis also forbade any commercial activities, which often lead to writing. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 11:9‚Äì17, 23:12‚Äì19; Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 340; Chayei Adam Shabbos 36 Erasing Hebrew: (Mo·∏•ek [al menat lichtov shtei otiyot]) Definition: Cleaning/preparing a surface to render it suitable for writing. Erasing in order to write two or more letters is an example of erasing. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 11:17; Chayei Adam Shabbos 38 Construction Hebrew: (Boneh) Definition: Contributing to the forming of any permanent structure. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 10:12‚Äì14 22:25‚Äì33; Chayei Adam Shabbos 39‚Äì44 Construction can take two forms. First, there was the action of actually joining the different pieces together to make the Mishkan. Inserting the handle of an ax into the socket is a derived form of this activity. It is held by some that the act of hala·∏•ic \\"Construction\\" is not actually performed (and therefore, the prohibition not violated) if the construction is not completed. Also, making a protective covering (or a \\"tent\\") is forbidden. Therefore, umbrellas may not be opened (or closed), and a board may not be placed on crates to form a bench. Either of these forms is only forbidden if done permanently, though not necessarily with permanent intent. For example, closing and locking a door is permitted, regardless of how long one intends to keep the door closed. Making a pop-up tent is considered permanent (since it can stay up for a long time), even if one intends to take it down soon afterwards. Demolition Hebrew: (Soter) Definition: Demolishing for any constructive purpose. For example, knocking down a wall in order to extend or repair the wall would be demolition for a constructive purpose. Combing a wig to set it correctly and pulling out hairs during the procedure with a metal toothed brush or comb would be constructive 'demolition', as each hair that is removed in the process of the wig (a utensil) is progressing its state towards a desired completion. Each hair's removal partially Demolishes the wig (for these legal purposes) and is considered constructive when viewed in context of the desired goal. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 10:15; Chayei Adam Shabbos 39, 43 Extinguishing a Fire Hebrew: (Me·∏•abeh) Definition: Extinguishing a fire/flame, or diminishing its intensity. While extinguishing a fire is forbidden even when great property damage will result; in the event of any life-threatening fire, the flames must be extinguished,Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 334. by the principle of pikua·∏• nefesh. See further: Shulkhan Arukh Orach Chayim 334; Chayei Adam Shabbos 45 Ignition Hebrew: (Mav'ir) Definition: Igniting, fueling or spreading a fire/flame. This includes making, transferring or adding fuel to a fire. (Note, however, that transferring fire is permitted on Jewish holidays. It is an exception to the rule that activities prohibited on the Sabbath are likewise prohibited on holidays.) This is one of the few Sabbath prohibitions mentioned explicitly in the Torah (). Judaism requires Sabbath candles to be lit before the Sabbath; it is forbidden to light them on the Sabbath. Ignition is one of the Sabbath laws that has been cited to prohibit electricity on Shabbat. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 12:1; Chayei Adam Shabbos 46 Final Completion/Fine- tuning/Perfection Hebrew: (Makeh B'patish), literally, striking with a hammer. Definition: Any initial act of completion. This complex, and possibly most abstract section of Sabbath law, refers to activities completing an object and/or bringing it into its final useful form. For example, if the pages of a newspaper were poorly separated, slicing them open would constitute the final act of completion of the pages.Ribiat, infra Using a stapler involves transgressing Final Completion/Fine-tuning/Perfection in regard to the staple itself, (in addition to Sewing affecting the papers being joined), which is brought into its final useful form by the base of the stapler forming the open staple into a curled clasp around the papers.Ribiat, infra Adding hot water to a pre-made 'noodle-soup-pot' type cup (a dehydrated mixture of freeze-dried seasoning and noodles) would be the final act of completion for such a food as the manufacturer desired to make the product incomplete, awaiting the consumer to finish the cooking process at their convenience. This particular example would also violate Cooking/Baking as well if hot water from a kettle/urn was directly applied.Ribiat, infra Musical instruments are Muktza, set aside for non-Sabbath use, as they are delicate and regularly require fixing and/or tuning as part of their regular use. Due to this, a Rabbinic restriction on handling musical instruments was enacted specifically because of Makeh B'patish. For example, if a guitar string is slightly out of tune, even though the whole instrument is not considered broken, the string requires tuning to bring the entire instrument to its desired state. As such, the corrective tuning renders an act of Makeh B'patish on the whole instrument. The guitar's said to be 'in tune', ready for usual use. This is considered a significant enough improvement to be an act of Makeh B'patish. See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 10:16‚Äì18, 23:4‚Äì9; Chayei Adam Shabbos 44 Transferring Between Domains Hebrew: (Hotza'ah) Definition: Transferring something from one domain type to another domain type, or transferring within a public thoroughfare. (Note, however, that Transferring Between Domains is permitted on Jewish holidays. It is an exception to the rule that activities prohibited on the Sabbath are likewise prohibited on holidays.) All areas are divided into four categories: a private domain, a public thoroughfare, an open area (carmelit) and an exempt area.Mishna, Shabbat, chapters 1 and 11 Transferring an object from a private domain to a public thoroughfare, or the reverse, is Biblically forbidden. Transferring an object between an open area to a private domain or public thoroughfare is rabbinically prohibited. Transferring an object between an exempt area and any other domain is permissible. In addition, transferring an object for a distance of four cubits (or more) in a public thoroughfare or open area is forbidden. For these purposes \\"transferring\\" means \\"removing and depositing\\". So carrying an article out of one domain type and returning to the same domain type, without setting it down in the interim in a different domain type, does not violate this activity. However, it is rabbinically prohibited. The definition of an area as public thoroughfare or private domain is related to its degree of enclosure, not solely based on ownership. This law is often referred to as carrying. This is a misnomer: carrying within a private domain is permitted; and carrying within an open area is Biblically permitted (though rabbinically forbidden). See further: Chayei Adam Shabbos 47‚Äì56. Exception: Saving of human life When human life is endangered, a Jew is not only allowed, but required, to violate any Sabbath law that stands in the way of saving that person.8 saved during \\"Shabbat from hell\\" (January 17, 2010) in Israel 21c Innovation News Service Retrieved 2010‚Äì01‚Äì18ZAKA rescuemission to Haiti 'proudly desecrating Shabbat' Religious rescue team holds Shabbat prayer with members of international missions in Port au-Prince.

Creators associated with SLG over the years include Evan Dorkin, Roman Dirge, Sarah Dyer, Woodrow Phoenix, Jhonen Vasquez, and Andi Watson. Company history Slave Labor Graphics was started in 1986 by Dan Vado, who remains the company's president and publisher. The first book Slave Labor Graphics published was ShadowStar #3, a female superhero character previously published independently by some of Vado's friends. Slave Labor Graphics's first major success was Samurai Penguin #1 by Dan and Mark Buck, which sold 58,000 copies in the summer of 1986. The first few titles, such as Hero Sandwich and It's Science With Dr. Radium, were all created by friends of Vado's from high school. Other successes were Milk & Cheese, a comic about mean-spirited anthropomorphic dairy products by Evan Dorkin, and Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, a comic about the adventures of a serial killer by Jhonen Vasquez. In this time period, comic book speculation was rampant, so Slave Labor Graphics was able to sell its entire print run of many titles. However, at the end of the mid-1990s speculation bubble, some distributors went out of business without paying Slave Labor Graphics. In 1995, Slave Labor Graphics added a more genre-oriented imprint called \\"Amaze Ink\\" intended to be for all audiences;\\"Newswatch: Slave Labor Announces New Format,\\" The Comics Journal #177 (May 1995), p. 33. the \\"stranger, more adult, and more difficult to categorize material\\" would still be published under the main \\"Slave Labor\\" imprint. In 2005, Slave Labor Graphics entered into a partnership with The Walt Disney Company to produce comic book series based on some of its properties: Haunted Mansion, Wonderland, Tron, and Gargoyles. Its own creations, such as Little Gloomy (1999‚Äì2005), Kid Gravity (2003‚Äì2007), and The Super Scary Monster Show: Featuring Little Gloomy (2005‚Äì2007), appeared regularly in Disney Adventures magazine.NYCC: Slave Labor Graphics' Dan Vado Talks Disney Licensed Comics .

Since 1894, the Japanese Imperial Family has maintained a residence in Hayama, the seaside Hayama Imperial Villa. Geography Hayama is located at the northern end of Miura Peninsula, facing Sagami Bay on the Pacific Ocean. The area has a temperate maritime climate with short cool winters, and hot humid summers. =Surrounding municipalities= *Zushi *Yokosuka History During the Edo period, all of eastern Sagami Province was tenry≈ç territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate, and administered by various hatamoto. During the cadastral reform of the early Meiji period in 1889, the area was reorganized into Hayama village through the merger of six hamlets. It was elevated to town status in 1925. Economy Despite its lack of rail connections, Hayama is now primarily a commuter town for Tokyo and Yokohama and, due to its mild climate, a popular resort area with a marina. Agricultural produce includes shiitake mushrooms, and a brand of beef known as \\"Hayama-gyu\\". A long time getaway for Tokyo's upper classes, Hayama has developed a reputation for being popular with actors and wealthy expats. Transportation Hayama is served by Japan National Route 134 highway.

It celebrates the delivery or expected birth of a child or the transformation of a woman into a mother. Baby shower cake (note that the coverlet is turned back waiting for the new baby) Etymology The term shower is often assumed to mean that the expectant mother is \\"showered\\" with gifts. A related custom, called a bridal shower, may have derived its name from the custom in the 19th century for the presents to be put inside a parasol, which when opened would \\"shower\\" the bride-to-be with gifts. Alternatively the term possibly denotes a \\"first showing\\" of the new baby to the wider family and circle of friends, although the baby shower is usually held before the birth of the baby. Description Cake and finger foods are often served at baby showers. Traditionally, baby showers are given only for the family's first child, and only women are invited, though this has changed in recent years, now allowing showers being split up for different audiences: workplace, mixed-sex, and feminist. Activities at baby showers include gift- giving and playing themed games. Baby shower games vary, sometimes including standard games such as bingo, and sometimes being pregnancy-themed, such as \\"guess the mother's measurements\\" or \\"guess the baby\\". These games help let the close friends attending the shower bond with the mother, and enable the new family to say thanks ahead of time, figuring out who is willing and able to help them with the challenges of bringing up a child. According to etiquette authority Miss Manners, because the party centers on gift-giving, the baby shower is typically arranged and hosted by a close friend rather than a member of the family, since it is considered rude for families to beg for gifts on behalf of their members. However, this custom varies by culture or region and in some it is expected and customary for a close female family member to host the baby shower, often the baby's maternal grandmother. When a baby shower is held after the birth of a baby, an invitation to attend the shower may be combined with a baby announcement. In the US, if a baby shower doesn't happen before the arrival of the baby, a sip-and-see party or other similar event can be organized after the birth.  Gifts  Guests bring small gifts for the expectant mother. Typical gifts related to babies include diapers, blankets, baby bottles, clothes, and toys. It is common to open the gifts during the party; sometimes the host will make a game of opening gifts.  Family bonding  The baby shower is a family's first opportunity to gather people together to help play a part in their child's life. The new parents may wish to call on people to assist in the upbringing of their child, and help educate the child over time. People around the family, who care for them, want to be involved in the child's life, and a baby shower presents an opportunity for them to give gifts and be of help, showing their love for the family. If it happens before the birth, it allows the new family to thank everyone before the stress of a new baby and lack of sleep begins.  History  Baby shower shortbread biscuits The term \\"baby shower\\" is relatively new, but the celebrations and rituals associated with pregnancy and childbirth are both ancient and enduring. ;Ancient India: In India, a pregnancy ritual has been followed since the vedic ages: an event called seemantha, held in the 6th or 8th month. The mother-to-be is showered with dry fruits, sweets and other gifts that help the baby's growth. A musical event to please the baby's ears is the highlight of the ritual, as it was common knowledge that the baby's ears would start functioning within the womb. The ritual prays for a healthy baby and mother, as well as a happy delivery and motherhood. ;Ancient Egypt: In ancient Egypt, rituals relating to the birth of a child took place after the event itself. Quite unlike modern baby showers, this involved the mother and the child being separated to \\"contain and eliminate the pollution of birth\\" ‚Äì this may have included visiting local temples or shrines. After this, there may also have been household rituals that took place, but the specifics have been found hard to study as these are such female-centered events. ;Ancient Greece: The ancient Greeks also celebrated pregnancy after the birth, with a shout (oloyge) after the labor has ended, to indicate that \\"peace had arrived\\". Five to seven days later, there is a ceremony called Amphidromia, to indicate that the baby had integrated into the household. In wealthy families, the public dekate ceremony, after ten days, indicated the mother's return to society. (The ten-day period is still observed in modern-day Iran.) ;Medieval Europe: Due to the likelihood a mother would die in childbirth, this time was recognized as having a great risk of spiritual danger in addition to the risk of physical danger. Priests would often visit women during labor so they could confess their sins. After the birth, usually on the same day, a baptism ceremony would take place for the baby. In this ceremony, the godparents would give gifts to the child, including a pair of silver spoons. ;Renaissance Europe: Pregnancies at this time were celebrated with many different kinds of birth gifts: functional items, like wooden trays and bowls, as well as paintings, sculptures, and food. Childbirth was seen as almost mystical, and mothers-to-be were often surrounded with references to the Annunciation by way of encouragement and celebration. ;Victorian Britain and North America: Victorian women would keep their pregnancies secret, upholding cultural standards of proper behavior, but after the baby was born, other women would often hold tea parties for the new mother. Superstitions sometimes led to speculation that a woman might be pregnant, such as two teaspoons being accidentally placed together on a saucer. Gifts were usually hand-made, but the grandmother would give silver. ;Modern North America: The modern baby shower in America started in the late 1940s and the 1950s, as post-war women were expecting the Baby Boom generation. As in earlier eras, when young women married and were provided with trousseau, the shower served the function of providing the mother and her home with useful material goods. While continuing the traditions from the 1950s, modern technology has altered the form a baby shower takes: games can include identifying baby parts on a sonogram. Moreover, although traditional baby showers were female-exclusive, mixed-sex showers have increased in frequency. In different countries Diaper cake Baby showers and other social events to celebrate an impending or recent birth are popular around the world. They are often women-only social gatherings. * In Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, baby showers are a common tradition. * In Bangladesh, in many places a party named \\"sadh\\" (‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶ß) or \\"sadhbhokkhon\\" (‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶ß‡¶≠‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶£) is observed on the seventh month of pregnancy. After this, the woman resides in her father's house instead of her husband's until the birth. * In Brazil, a party called \\"ch√° de beb√™\\" (baby tea) is offered before birth. * In Bulgaria, as a superstition, no baby gifts are given to the family prior to the baby's birth. However, family and friends give or send unsolicited gifts to the newborn baby, even if some babies are kept from the public for the first 40 days to prevent early infections. * In Chinese tradition a baby shower, manyue (Êª°Êúà), is held one month after the baby is born. * In Hmong culture, a baby shower is called \\"Puv Hli,\\" and is held one month after the baby is born. A ceremony would be hosted by the paternal grandparents or the father to welcome the baby to the family by tying the baby's wrist with white yarn and/or strings. *In Italy, such a party is not customary, nor part of traditional culture. * In Armenia, a baby shower is called \\"qarasunq\\" (÷Ñ’°’º’°’Ω’∏÷Ç’∂÷Ñ) and is celebrated 40 days after the birth. It is a mixed party for all relatives and friends. Guests usually bring gifts for the baby or parents. * In Iran, a baby shower (Persian:ÿ≠ŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿ≤ÿß€åŸÖÿßŸÜ) is also called a \\"sismooni party\\" (Persian:ÿ¨ÿ¥ŸÜ ÿ≥€åÿ≥ŸÖŸàŸÜ€å). It is celebrated 1‚Äì3 months before the baby's birth. Family and close friends give gifts intended for the baby such as a cot, toys, and baby clothes. * In Costa Rica, a baby shower party is called t√© de canastilla (\\"basket tea\\"), and multiple events are held for a single pregnancy for the family, co-workers, and friends. * In Nepal, a baby-shower party is called \\"dahi-chiura\\" (‡§¶‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§ø‡§â‡§∞‡§æ) and is celebrated in the sixth or seventh month of pregnancy. * In Mongolia, a baby shower is called \\"—Ö“Ø“Ø—Ö–¥–∏–π–Ω —É–≥–∞–∞–ª–≥–∞\\" (huuhdyn ugaalga). * In Hindu tradition, they are called by different names depending on the family's community. ** In northern India it is known as godbharaai, in western India, especially Maharashtra, the celebration is known as dohaaljewan, and in West Bengal and Odisha it is called saadhroshi. ** In southern India, in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh it is called seemantham, valaikaapu or poochoottal (the expecting mother wears bangles and is adorned with flowers). ** In Karnataka it is called seemanta(‡≤∏‡≥Ä‡≤Æ‡≤Ç‡≤§) or kubasa (‡≤ï‡≥Å‡≤¨‡≤∏). It is held when the woman is in her 5th, 7th, or 9th month of pregnancy. ** In coastal Karnataka, especially in Tulunadu (Tulu speaking region), the ceremony is also known as \\"baayake\\" ('‡≤¨‡≤æ‡≤Ø‡≤ï‡≥Ü'). Baayake in Tulu means desire. It is popularly considered that pregnant women crave fruits and eatables during the pregnancy period; and the ceremony was designed in the olden days to fulfill the desire or food cravings of the mom-to-be. ** Although these might be celebrated together, they are very different: seemantham is a religious ceremony, while valaikappu and poochoottal are purely social events much like Western baby showers. In a valaikappu or poochoottal, music is played and the expectant mother is decked in traditional attire with many flowers and garlands made of jasmine or mogra. A swing is decorated with flowers of her choice, which she uses to sit and swing. At times, symbolic cut-outs of moons and stars are put up. The elderly ladies from the household and community shower blessings on the expectant mother and gifts are given to her. ** In Gujarat, it is known as seemant or kholo bharyo, a religious ritual for most Gujarati Hindus during the 5th or 7th month of pregnancy, usually only for the first child. The expectant mother can only go to her father's house for delivery after her seemant. They offer special prayer and food to the goddess \\"Randal, the wife of the Sun\\". ** In Jain tradition, the baby shower ceremony is often called as \\"Shreemant\\". The expectant mother can go to her father's house in the 5th month of pregnancy and has to come back before the baby shower ceremony. After the ceremony the expectant mother cannot go back to her father's house. The ceremony is only performed on Sunday, Tuesday or Thursday of the seventh or ninth month of pregnancy. During the ceremony one of the practice is that the younger brother- in - law of the expectant mother dips his hands in Kumkuma water and slaps the expectant mother seven times on her cheeks and then the expectant mother slaps her younger brother - in - law seven times on his cheeks. ** In Kerala it is known as pulikudi or vayattu pongala', and is practiced predominantly in the Nair community, though its popularity has spread to other Hindu sects over the years. On an auspicious day, after being massaged with homemade ayurvedic oil the woman has a customary bath with the help of the elderly women in the family. After this, the family deity is worshipped, invoking all the paradevatas (family deities) and a concoction of herbal medicines prepared in the traditional way, is given to the woman. She is dressed in new clothes and jewellery used for such occasions. A big difference in the western concept of baby shower and Hindu tradition is that the Hindu ceremony is a religious ceremony to pray for the baby's well-being. In most conservative families, gifts are bought for the mother-to-be but not the baby. The baby is showered with gifts only after birth. * In the Islamic tradition of Aqiqah, an animal (such as a sheep) is slaughtered anytime after the birth, and the meat is distributed among relatives and the poor. The practice is considered sunnah and is not done universally.The sacred meadows : a structural analysis of religious symbolism in an East African town / by Abdul Hamid M. el Zein.'Raise your voices and kill your animals' : Islamic discourses on the Idd el-Hajj and sacrifices in Tanga (Tanzania) : authoritative texts, ritual practices and social identities / by Gerard C. van de Bruinhorst full text * In South Africa, a baby shower is called a stork party (named after the folk myth that a white stork delivers babies), and typically takes place during the mother's 6th month. Stork parties, usually not attended by men and often organized as a surprise for the mother, involve silliness such as dressing up, and mothers receive gifts of baby supplies. * In Nepal a baby shower is known as \\"dahi chiura khuwaune\\". The mother-to-be is given gifts from her elders and a meal is cooked for her according to her preferences. The pregnant mother is often invited by her relatives to eat meals with them. Pasni is a traditional celebration that often marks a baby boy's 6th month or a baby girl's fifth month, marking the transition to a diet higher in carbohydrates and allowing guests to bestow blessings, and money and other gifts. * In Guatemala, only women attend this event. Middle-class women usually celebrate more than one baby shower (one with close friends, co- workers, family, etc.). * In Russia, and Commonwealth of Independent States, there are no baby showers, though some of the younger generation are starting to adapt it. * In Egypt a baby shower is known as \\" Sebouh \\" (ÿ≥ÿ®Ÿàÿπ) (sebouh means week) which is usually celebrated one week after birth hence its name. This is usually celebrated with a dj, much decoration, a food and candy buffet, activities and games. * In Puerto Rico, a baby shower is celebrated anytime after other family members are made aware of the pregnancy, but typically during the last trimester. The grandmother, sisters, or friends of the pregnant mother organize the celebration and invite other relatives and friends. It is not common for men to attend baby showers. The \\"bendici√≥n\\" (blessing) is bestowed money and other gifts. Baby showers for fathers Some baby showers are directed at fathers. These may be more oriented towards drinking beer, watching sports, fishing, or playing video games. The primary nature of these gifts is diapers and/or diaper-related items. The organization of the diaper party is typically done by the friends of the father-to-be as a way of helping to prepare for the coming child. These parties may be held at local pubs/bars, a friend's house, or the soon-to-be grandfather's house. In the United Kingdom, this is called wetting the baby's head, and is generally more common than baby showers. Wetting the baby's head is traditionally when the father celebrates the birth by having a few drinks and getting drunk with a group of friends. There has been some controversy over these, with Judith Martin calling them a \\"monstrous imposition\\", although she was referring to the attitude of demanding gifts and not necessarily the male version of a baby shower. In Hungary, such an event is called Milking party held by tradition in favor of the mother to be blessed with breast milk for the newborn. Practically it is the last day-off of the father for some time as he is expected to stay home to help. No similar domestic custom exists for mothers, such as a baby shower. Gifts for the baby are given on the first visit to his/her home. This due to health concerns happens at the appropriate and suitable time for each counterpart. Names for events A buffet at a baby shower, featuring an appropriately themed cake. *Diaper shower refers to a small-scale baby shower, generally for subsequent children, when the parents don't need as many baby supplies. *Grandma's shower refers to a shower at which people bring items for the grandparents to keep at their house, such as a collapsible crib and a changing pad. *Sprinkles are small showers for a subsequent child, especially a child who is of a different gender than the previous offspring. *A sip and see party is a celebration usually planned by the new parents, so that friends and family can sip on refreshments and meet the new baby.

Fumigation of a hotel (Vila Shanti) in Bali where the smoke even reaches the hotel lobby (Feb 2010). Fumigation is a method of pest control that completely fills an area with gaseous pesticides--or fumigants--to suffocate or poison the pests within. It is used to control pests in buildings (structural fumigation), soil, grain, and produce, and is also used during processing of goods to be imported or exported to prevent transfer of exotic organisms. This method also affects the structure itself, affecting pests that inhabit the physical structure, such as woodborers and drywood termites. Process Fumigation generally involves the following phases: First, the area intended for fumigation is covered to create a sealed environment. Next, the fumigant is released into the space to be fumigated. The space is held for a set period while the fumigant gas percolates through the space and acts on/kills any infestation in the area. Finally, the space is ventilated so that the poisonous gases are allowed to escape from the space, rendering it safe for humans to enter. If successful, the fumigated area is now safe and pest free. Tent fumigation  Structural fumigation techniques differ from building to building. In a residential setting, a \\"rubber\\" tent or tents, typically made of plastic/pvc coated canvas material, may be placed over the entire house while the pesticides are being released into the vacant residence. This process is called tent fumigation, or \\"tenting\\". The sealed tent concentrates the poisonous gases and prevents them from escaping into the neighborhood. The process can take up to a week depending on the fumigant used, which is in turn, dependent on the temperature and the pest. Operating theatres  Fumigation of hospital rooms with high concentrations of toxic chemicals has been proposed to reduce microbial agents on hospital surfaces and to control surgical site infections. Formaldehyde fumigation has long been an accepted method for areas where microbiological cleanliness is required. Fumigation with formaldehyde vapor is the recognized and most commonly used method because it is a cost-effective procedure. However, alternative methods are sought due to safety and efficacy concerns. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is a dry gaseous method that has been used as a reliable alternative for aseptic processing isolators, and more recently, for room/facility decontamination. hydrogen peroxide and silver in solution, this is non-toxic, eco-friendly, chlorine-free, non-mutagenic agents.various forms of H2O2 is available, having the concentration of 10% H2O2 with acidic pH and odorless. It is diluted in water and does not cost material. For example, for 1000 ft^3 of the area to be fumigated use 20% (i.e. 200 mL of solution in 800 mL demineralized water), and spray it for 30 minutes by using a fogger. Fogging may be done at a rate of 130 mL/minute. The contact time shall be at least one hour. Chemicals *Methyl bromide was among the most widely used fumigants until its production and use was restricted by the Montreal Protocol due to its role in ozone depletion. * 1,3-dichloropropene * dazomet (methyl isothiocyanate precursor) *chloropicrin * DBCP * formaldehyde * hydrogen cyanide * iodoform * methyl isocyanate * phosphine * sulfuryl fluoride Safety Fumigation is a hazardous operation. Generally it is a legal requirement that the operator who carries out the fumigation operation holds official certification to perform the fumigation, as the chemicals used are toxic to most forms of life, including humans. Post operation ventilation of the area is a critical safety aspect of fumigation. It is important to distinguish between the pack or source of the fumigant gas and the environment which has been fumigated. While the fumigant pack may be safe and spent, the space will still hold the fumigant gas until it has been ventilated. See also * ISPM 15 Early publication * W. G.

It provides landline telephone, fiber-optic Internet, and IPTV services through its subsidiaries Cincinnati Bell Telephone and Hawaiian Telcom, which are the incumbent local exchange carriers for the Cincinnati and Dayton metropolitan areas and Hawaii. Other subsidiaries provide enterprise information technology services and long distance calling. Cincinnati Bell was founded in 1873 as a telegraph company and for much of its history was a Bell System franchisee. In the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell expanded into Internet access and mobile phone services. The company divested its mobile phone service in 2014 to focus on enterprise and fiber-optic services. It was acquired in 2020 by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (pending approval). History The Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building is a registered historic building. Cincinnati Bell was founded as the City and Suburban Telegraph Association on July 5, 1873. Founder Charles Kilgour had run the Cincinnati Street Railway with his brother John but became homebound after an accident and began running his business from home via telegraph. The City and Suburban Telegraph Association ran telegraph lines between homes and businesses beginning in 1873, three years before the invention of the telephone. In 1878, it gained exclusive rights to the Bell franchise within a radius of Cincinnati, becoming the first telephone exchange in Ohio and the tenth in the United States. It has substantially the same three-state incumbent local exchange carrier territory today. On August 21, 1877, it signed its first telephone customer, the Cincinnati Gas-Light and Coke Company (later known as Cincinnati Gas and Electric). The company was renamed Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Telephone Company in 1903. From 1930 to 1952, the company converted its exchanges from staffed switchboards to dial service. Seven-digit dialing was introduced in 1962. In 1968, electromechanical switching equipment was replaced by one of the first electronic switching systems. The company formally simplified its name to Cincinnati Bell in 1971. In May 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio awarded Cincinnati Bell Long Distance the right to offer local wireline telephone service in 55 counties outside its incumbent territory and the company began to resell business local phone service in these counties, in competition with incumbent carrier Ameritech. During the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell acquired a nationwide transmission network formerly known as IXC Communications and changed its corporate name to \\"Broadwing Communications,\\" although the local telephone operations continued to operate under the traditional Cincinnati Bell name. The acquisition fell short of expectations due to intense competition and lackluster demand and left Broadwing with over $ in debt. In 2004, the holding company divested the long-distance operation as Broadwing Corporation and changed its name back to Cincinnati Bell. In 2002, Cincinnati Bell sold Cincinnati Bell Directory, consisting of its directory operations, to Spectrum Equity. The resulting company is named CBD Media. The sale marked the first time a former Bell System-affiliated company had sold off its directory operations. In 2003, when BellSouth exited the payphone market, some former BellSouth payphones in Kentucky were sold to Cincinnati Bell. In 2017, Cincinnati Bell acquired Toronto-based OnX Enterprise Solutions for $. On July 2, 2018, Cincinnati Bell acquired Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc., parent of local telephone company Hawaiian Telcom, for $. The Hawaiian Telcom acquisition grew Cincinnati Bell's fiber network to over . In March 2020, Cincinnati Bell merged with Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets. =Relationship to the Bell System= Cincinnati Bell's residential landline service continued to use the classic Bell logo until 2016. Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET) were the only two companies in the old Bell System that operated independently because AT&T; Corporation only owned minority stakes in the companies. Therefore, neither is considered a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), AT&T; was not obligated to dispose of their ownership stakes in the companies, and restrictions placed on the Baby Bells did not apply to these two companies. AT&T; owned 32.6% of Cincinnati Bell until 1984, at which point the shares AT&T; owned were placed into a trust and then sold. In 1998, SNET was bought by SBC Communications (Now the new AT&T;), an RBOC, and in 2014 was sold to Frontier Communications, a company with no relation to the former Bell System. Cincinnati Bell and BellSouth are the only Bell System companies that continue to publicly do business under the \\"Bell\\" name. In July 2006, Cincinnati Bell removed the final iteration of the Bell logo‚Äîdesigned in 1969 by Saul Bass‚Äîfrom most of its corporate branding, leaving only a stylized wordmark. However, the company continued to use the Bell logo in promotional materials for residential landline and long-distance service until another it adopted a new logo in 2016. Service area Cincinnati Bell's conventional telecommunications services are concentrated in markets where its subsidiaries have historically enjoyed incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) status. Since the 1870s, Cincinnati Bell Telephone has been the ILEC within a radius of approximately from downtown Cincinnati. , the three-state territory consists of: * Hamilton County, most of Clermont and Butler counties, and a small part of Warren County in Ohio * Boone, Campbell, Gallatin, Grant, Kenton, and Pendleton counties in Kentucky * West Harrison, Indiana Beyond its ILEC territory, Cincinnati Bell Telephone additionally serves Mason, Lebanon, and the Dayton metropolitan area through its subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories. Hawaiian Telcom, which Cincinnati Bell acquired in 2018, is the ILEC for the entire state of Hawaii. OnX provides enterprise IT solutions in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. Services Cincinnati Bell has historically focused on traditional landline service, but in recent decades it has expanded into adjacent communications and entertainment services. , legacy voice service makes up only a quarter of the company's revenue. =Landline service= Cincinnati Bell provides landline PSTN local and long-distance calling. In recent years, the company has seen subscriptions to these traditional services decline due to competition from cable and wireless providers. =Internet access= Cincinnati Bell offers Internet access to customers in its service area. Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet. =Fiber optics= In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber- optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called Fioptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&T; and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications. Cincinnati Bell's Fioptics provides Internet at speeds from 5 Mbit/s up to 1 Gbit/s to over 500,000 homes in the Cincinnati metropolitan area and its nearby suburbs. The availability is limited to areas currently wired for Fioptics, and other Fioptics services are not required. In areas now covered by Fioptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds greater than 5 Mbit/s. , Cincinnati Bell's fiber optic network extends nearly . =Electricity= In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service. Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers' electricity bills. The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from National Wind. Former services =Wireless telephony= Former Cincinnati Bell Wireless logo used until mid-2006 From 1998 until 2015, Cincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) offered GSM wireless service in southeastern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northwestern Kentucky. It was sold at Best Buy, Circuit City (until 2009), Office Depot, and participating Kroger locations. It offered HSPA+ service in most of Hamilton County, Ohio, and parts of surrounding counties; EDGE service in Dayton and Oxford; and GSM service elsewhere. The local coverage area extended north to Celina and Urbana, east to Hillsboro, south to Corinth and Warsaw, and west to Batesville. Cincinnati Bell's prepaid mobile phone products were sold under the same i-wireless brand as an unrelated service by locally based Kroger. Cincinnati Bell made its first foray into wireless telephony around 1986, when it acquired a 45% stake in Ameritech Cellular. On February 2, 1998, Cincinnati Bell acquired 80% of AT&T; Wireless Services's new Cincinnati-Dayton PCS network for over $100 million. Cincinnati Bell's subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Wireless was responsible for marketing and sales, while AT&T; Wireless handled technical operations for the joint venture. Wireless service began by June in Cincinnati and by September in Dayton, eventually covering a 21-county area. When AT&T; Wireless was purchased by Cingular, now known as AT&T; Mobility, control of its 20% stake also passed to Cingular. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of CBW by purchasing Cingular's stake for $83 million. As a part of the deal, Cincinnati Bell and Cingular secured lower roaming charges on each other's respective GSM networks. On April 7, 2014, Cincinnati Bell announced plans to sell its wireless spectrum and other assets to Verizon Wireless, as part of a planned emphasis on enterprise and entertainment services such as Fioptics. Cincinnati Bell Wireless ended service on February 28, 2015. The company's retail locations began selling Verizon products. =Directories= Like other Bell System‚Äìaffiliated companies, Cincinnati Bell published a series of local telephone directories, beginning in 1879. In 2002, it spun off these operations as CBD Media. Retail presence Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&T.; It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations. , the company operates nine Cincinnati Bell Stores. Downtown Cincinnati presence Atrium Two Cincinnati Bell's headquarters are located in the Atrium Two building on 4th Street in Downtown Cincinnati. The company's former headquarters and telephone exchange on 7th Street is known as the Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Next door is a data center operated by CyrusOne, a former Cincinnati Bell subsidiary. It originally opened in 1975 as Cincinnati Bell's central Switching Center. Cincinnati Bell owns the naming rights to the Cincinnati Bell Connector streetcar line that traverses the downtown area. In August 2016, Cincinnati Bell paid $ to rename the line for 10 years. From 2007 to 2014 Cincinnati Bell also sponsored the annual Cincinnati Bell/WEBN Riverfest, one of the largest fireworks displays in the Midwest.

Cadmium sulfide is a yellow solid.Egon Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman (2001) Inorganic Chemistry, Elsevier It occurs in nature with two different crystal structures as the rare minerals greenockite and hawleyite, but is more prevalent as an impurity substituent in the similarly structured zinc ores sphalerite and wurtzite, which are the major economic sources of cadmium. As a compound that is easy to isolate and purify, it is the principal source of cadmium for all commercial applications. Its vivid yellow color led to its adoption as a pigment for the yellow paint \\"cadmium yellow\\" in the 18th century. Production Cadmium sulfide can be prepared by the precipitation from soluble cadmium(II) salts with sulfide ion. This reaction has been used for gravimetric analysis and qualitative inorganic analysis.Fred Ibbotson (2007), The Chemical Analysis of Steel-Works' Materials,Read Books, The preparative route and the subsequent treatment of the product, affects the polymorphic form that is produced (i.e., cubic vs hexagonal). It has been asserted that chemical precipitation methods result in the cubic zincblende form.Paul Klocek (1991), Handbook of Infrared Optical Materials, CRC Press Pigment production usually involves the precipitation of CdS, the washing of the solid precipitate to remove soluble cadmium salts followed by calcination (roasting) to convert it to the hexagonal form followed by milling to produce a powder. When cadmium sulfide selenides are required the CdSe is co- precipitated with CdS and the cadmium sulfoselenide is created during the calcination step. Cadmium sulfide is sometimes associated with sulfate reducing bacteria.Larry L.

The more stable hexagonal wurtzite structure (found in the mineral Greenockite) and the cubic zinc blende structure (found in the mineral Hawleyite).

Cadmium sulfide is a direct band gap semiconductor (gap 2.42 eVD.

Applications =Pigment= Yellow cadmium sulfide- pigment CdS is used as pigment in plastics, showing good thermal stability, light and weather fastness, chemical resistance and high opacity. As a pigment, CdS is known as cadmium yellow. (CI pigment yellow 37R. M.

Geography ≈åiso is located on the coastline of central Kanagawa Prefecture, facing Sagami Bay of the Pacific Ocean. The area is generally hilly, rising to Mount Koma (168 metres) in the northwest of the centre of town. The area has a temperate maritime climate with short, cool winters and hot, humid summers.

Trust metrics may be abstracted in a manner that can be implemented on computers, making them of interest for the study and engineering of virtual communities, such as Friendster and LiveJournal. Trust escapes a simple measurement because its meaning is too subjective for universally reliable metrics, and the fact that it is a mental process, unavailable to instruments. There is a strong argumentCastelfranchi, C. and Falcone, R. (2000) Trust is much more than subjective probability: Mental components and sources of trust. Proc. of the 33rd Hawaii Int. Conf. on System Sciences (HICSS2000). Vol. 6. against the use of simplistic metrics to measure trust due to the complexity of the process and the 'embeddedness' of trust that makes it impossible to isolate trust from related factors. There is no generally agreed set of properties that make a particular trust metric better than others, as each metric is designed to serve different purposes, e.g.Ziegler, C.-N., and Lausen, G. (2005) Propagation Models for Trust and Distrust in Social Networks. Inf. Syst. Frontiers vol. 7, no. 4‚Äì5, pp. 337‚Äì358 provides certain classification scheme for trust metrics. Two groups of trust metrics can be identified: * Empirical metrics focusing on supporting the capture of values of trust in a reliable and standardized way; * Formal metrics that focus on formalization leading to the ease of manipulation, processing and reasoning about trust. Formal metrics can be further classified depending on their properties. Trust metrics enable trust modellingMarsh, S. P. (1994) Formalising Trust as a Computational Concept. University of Stirling PhD thesis. and reasoning about trust. They are closely related to reputation systems. Simple forms of binary trust metrics can be found e.g. in PGP.Zimmermann, P. (1993) Pretty Good Privacy User's Guide, Volume I and II. Distributed with the PGP software The first commercial forms of trust metrics in computer software were in applications like eBay's Feedback Rating. Slashdot introduced its notion of karma, earned for activities perceived to promote group effectiveness, an approach that has been very influential in later virtual communities. Empirical metrics Empirical metrics capture the value of trust by exploring the behavior or introspection of people, to determine the perceived or expressed level of trust. Those methods combine theoretical background (determining what it is that they measure) with defined set of questions and statistical processing of results. The willingness to cooperate, as well as actual cooperation, are commonly used to both demonstrate and measure trust. The actual value (level of trust and/or trustworthiness) is assessed from the difference between observed and hypothetical behaviors i.e. those that would have been anticipated in the absence of cooperation. =Surveys= Surveys capture the level of trust by means of both observations or introspection, but without engaging into any experiments. Respondents are usually providing answers to a set of questions or statements and responses are e.g. structured according to a Likert scale. Differentiating factors are the underlying theoretical background and contextual relevance. One of the earliest surveys are McCroskey's scales James C. McCroskey, J. C. (1966) Scales for the Measurement of Ethos. Speech Monographs, 33, 65‚Äì72. that have been used to determine authoritativeness (competence) and character (trustworthiness) of speakers. Rempel's trust scale Rempel, J. K., Holmes, J. G. and Zanna, M. P. (1985): Trust in close relationships. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. vol. 49 no. 1, pp. 95‚Äì112. 1985. and Rotter's scale Rotter, J. B. (1971) Generalized expectancies for interpersonal trust. American Psychologist, vol. 26 no. 5 pp. 443‚Äì52. are quite popular in determining the level of interpersonal trust in different settings. The Organizational Trust Inventory (OTI) Cummings, L. L., and Bromiley, P. (1996) The Organizational Trust Inventory (OTI): Development and Validation. In: Kramer, R. M. and Tyler, T. R.: Trust in Organizations. Sage Publications. is an example of an exhaustive, theory-driven survey that can be used to determine the level of trust within the organisation. For a particular research area a more specific survey can be developed. For example, the interdisciplinary model of trust,McKnight, D. H., Chervany, N. L. (2001) Conceptualizing Trust: A Typology and E-Commerce Customer Relationships Model. Proc. of the 34th Hawaii Int. Conf. on System Sciences has been verified using a survey while Corritore, C. L. et al (2005) Measuring Online Trust of Websites: Credibility, Perceived Ease of Use, and Risk. In: Proc. of Eleventh Americas Conf. on Information Systems, Omaha, NE, USA pp. 2419‚Äì2427. uses a survey to establish the relationship between design elements of the web site and perceived trustworthiness of it. =Games= Another empirical method to measure trust is to engage participants in experiments, treating the outcome of such experiments as estimates of trust. Several games and game-like scenarios have been tried, some of which estimate trust or confidence in monetary terms (see Keser, C. (2003) Experimental games for the design of reputation management systems. IBM Systems J., vol. 42, no. 3. Article for an interesting overview). Games of trust are designed in a way that their Nash equilibrium differ from Pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximize his own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation, while cooperating partners can benefit. Trust can be therefore estimated on the basis of monetary gain attributable to cooperation. The original 'game of trust' has been described in Berg, J., Dickhaut, J., and McCabe, K. (1995) Trust, Reciprocity, and Social History, Games and Economic Behavior 10, 122‚Äì142 as an abstracted investment game between an investor and his broker. The game can be played once or several times, between randomly chosen players or in pairs that know each other, yielding different results. Several variants of the game exist, focusing on different aspects of trust as the observable behaviour. For example, rules of the game can be reversed into what can be called a game of distrust,Bohnet, I., and Meier, S. (2005) Deciding to distrust. KSG Working Paper No. RWP05-049. declaratory phase can be introduced Airiau, S., and Sen, S. (2006) Learning to Commit in Repeated Games. In: Proc. of the Fifth Int. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS06). or rules can be presented in a variety of ways, altering the perception of participants. Other interesting games are e.g. binary-choice trust games,Camerer, C., and Weigelt, K. (1988) Experimental Tests of a Sequential Equilibrium Reputation Model. Econometrica 56(1), pp. 1‚Äì36. the gift-exchange game,Fehr, E., Kirchsteiger, G., and Riedl, A. (1993) Does Fairness Prevent Market Clearing? An Experimental Investigation. Quarterly Journal of Economics 108(May), pp. 437‚Äì60. cooperative trust games, and various other forms of social games. Specifically the Prisoners Dilemma Poundstone, W. (1992) Prisoner's Dilemma. Doubleday, NY. 1992 are popularly used to link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity. For multi-player games, different forms of close market simulations exist Bolton, G. E., Elena Katok, E., and Ockenfels, A. (2003) How Effective are Electronic Reputation Mechanisms? An Experimental Investigation. Formal metrics Formal metrics focus on facilitating trust modelling, specifically for large scale models that represent trust as an abstract system (e.g. social network or web of trust). Consequently, they may provide weaker insight into the psychology of trust, or in particulars of empirical data collection. Formal metrics tend to have a strong foundations in algebra, probability or logic. =Representation= There is no widely recognised way to attribute value to the level of trust, with each representation of a 'trust value' claiming certain advantages and disadvantages. There are systems that assume only binary values,Adams, C., and Lloyd, S. (2002) Understanding PKI: Concepts, Standards, and Deployment Considerations. Sams. that use fixed scale,Zimmermann, P. (ed.) (1994) PGP User's Guide. MIT Press, Cambridge. where confidence range from -100 to +100 (while excluding zero),Tyrone Grandison, T. (2003) Trust Management for Internet Applications.

(2006) Modelling Multi-Dimensional Trust. In: Proc. of Fifth Int. Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems AAMAS-06. Hakodate, Japan. Some metrics use ordered set of values without attempting to convert them to any particular numerical range (e.g.Nielsen, M. and Krukow, K. (2004) On the Formal Modelling of Trust in Reputation-Based Systems. In: Karhumaki, J. et al. (Eds.): Theory Is Forever, Essays Dedicated to Arto Salomaa on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3113 Springer. See Abdul-Rahman, A. (2005) A Framework for Decentralised trust Reasoning. PhD Thesis. for a detailed overview). There is also a disagreement about the semantics of some values. The disagreement regarding the attribution of values to levels of trust is specifically visible when it comes to the meaning of zero and to negative values. For example, zero may indicate either the lack of trust (but not distrust), or lack of information, or a deep distrust. Negative values, if allowed, usually indicate distrust, but there is a doubt Cofta, P. (2006) Distrust. In: Proc. of Eight Int. Conf. on Electronic Commerce ICEC'06, Fredericton, Canada. pp. 250‚Äì258. whether distrust is simply trust with a negative sign, or a phenomenon of its own. =Subjective probability= Subjective probability Gambetta, D. (2000) Can We Trust Trust? In: Gambetta, D. (ed.) Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations, electronic edition, Department of Sociology, University of Oxford, chapter 13, pp. 213‚Äì237, focuses on trustor's self-assessment about his trust in the trustee. Such an assessment can be framed as an anticipation regarding future behaviour of the trustee, and expressed in terms of probability. Such a probability is subjective as it is specific to the given trustor, their assessment of the situation, information available to him etc. In the same situation other trustors may have a different level of a subjective probability. Subjective probability creates a valuable link between formalisation and empirical experimentation. Formally, subjective probability can benefit from available tools of probability and statistics. Empirically, subjective probability can be measured through one-side bets. Assuming that the potential gain is fixed, the amount that a person bets can be used to estimate his subjective probability of a transaction. =Uncertain probabilities (subjective logic)= The logic for uncertain probabilities (subjective logic) has been introduced by Josang Josang, A. (2001) A Logic for Uncertain Probabilities. International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems. Vol. 9 no., pp. 279‚Äì311, June 2001.J√∏sang, A. (2016), where uncertain probabilities are called subjective opinions. This elegant concept combines probability distribution with uncertainty, so that each opinion about trust can be viewed as a distribution of probability distributions where each distribution is qualified by associated uncertainty. The foundation of the trust representation is that an opinion (an evidence or a confidence) about trust can be represented as a four-tuple (trust, distrust, uncertainty, base rate), where trust, distrust and uncertainty must add up to one, and hence are dependent through additivity. Subjective logic is an example of computational trust where uncertainty is inherently embedded in the calculation process and is visible at the output. It is not the only one, it is e.g. possible to use a similar quadruplet (trust, distrust, unknown, ignorance) to express the value of confidence,Ding, L., Zhou, L., and Finin, T. (2003) Trust Based Knowledge Outsourcing for Semantic Web Agents. 2003 IEEE / WIC Int. Conf. on Web Intelligence, (WI 2003), Halifax, Canada. as long as the appropriate operations are defined. Despite the sophistication of the subjective opinion representation, the particular value of a four-tuple related to trust can be easily derived from a series of binary opinions about a particular actor or event, thus providing a strong link between this formal metric and empirically observable behaviour. Finally, there are CertainTrust Ries, S. (2009) Extending bayesian trust models regarding context-dependence and user friendly representation. Proceedings of the 2009 ACM symposium on Applied Computing (ACM SAC). and CertainLogic.Ries, S.; Habib, S. M.; M√ºhlh√§user, M.; Varadharajan V. (2011) Certainlogic: A logic for modeling trust and uncertainty (Short Paper). Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Trust and Trustworthy Computing (TRUST), Springer . Both share a common representation, which is equivalent to subjective opinions, but based on three independent parameters named 'average rating', 'certainty', and 'initial expectation'. Hence, there is a bijective mapping between the CertainTrust-triplet and the four-tuple of subjective opinions. =Fuzzy logic= Fuzzy systems ( Falcone, R., Pezzulo, G., and Castelfranchi, C. (2003) A Fuzzy Approach to a Belief-Based Trust Computation. In: R. Falcone at al. (Eds.): AAMAS 2002 Ws Trust, Reputation, LNAI 2631 pp. 73‚Äì86 ), as a trust metrics can link natural language expressions with a meaningful numerical analysis. Application of fuzzy logic to trust has been studied in the context of peer to peer networks Damiani, E. et al. (2003) Fuzzy logic techniques for reputation management in anonymous peer-to-peer systems. In Proc. of the Third Int. Conf. in Fuzzy Logic and Technology, Zittau, Germany. to improve peer rating. Also for grid computing Song, S., Hwang, K., and Macwan, M. (2004) Fuzzy Trust Integration for Security Enforcement in Grid Computing. Proc. In: Proc. of IFIP Int. Symposium on Network and Parallel Computing (NPC-2004). LNCS 3222. pp. 9‚Äì21. it has been demonstrated that fuzzy logic allows to solve security issues in reliable and efficient manner. Properties of trust metrics The set of properties that should be satisfied by a trust metric vary, depending on the application area. Following is a list of typical properties. =Transitivity= Transitivity is a highly desired property of a trust metric.Richters, O., Peixoto. T.P. (2011) Trust Transitivity in Social Networks. PLoS ONE 6(4): e18384. In situations where A trusts B and B trusts C, transitivity concerns the extent to which A trusts C. Without transitivity, trust metrics are unlikely to be used to reason about trust in more complex relationships. The intuition behind transitivity follows everyday experience of 'friends of a friend' (FOAF), the foundation of social networks. However, the attempt to attribute exact formal semantics to transitivity reveals problems, related to the notion of a trust scope or context. For example,Josang, A., and Pope, S. (2005) Semantic Constraints for Trust Transitivity Second Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling (APCCM2005). defines conditions for the limited transitivity of trust, distinguishing between direct trust and referral trust. Similarly,D. Quercia, S. Hailes, L. Capra. Lightweight Distributed Trust Propagation. ICDM'07. shows that simple trust transitivity does not always hold, based on information on the Advogato model and, consequently, have proposed new trust metrics. The simple, holistic approach to transitivity is characteristic to social networks (FOAF, Advogato). It follows everyday intuition and assumes that trust and trustworthiness apply to the whole person, regardless of the particular trust scope or context. If one can be trusted as a friend, one can be also trusted to recommend or endorse another friend. Therefore, transitivity is semantically valid without any constraints, and is a natural consequence of this approach. The more thorough approach distinguishes between different scopes/contexts of trust, and does not allow for transitivity between contexts that are semantically incompatible or inappropriate. A contextual approach may, for instance, distinguish between trust in a particular competence, trust in honesty, trust in the ability to formulate a valid opinion, or trust in the ability to provide reliable advice about other sources of information. A contextual approach is often used in trust-based service composition.Chang, E., Dillion, T., and Hussain, F. K. (2006) Trust and Reputation for Service- Oriented Environments: Technologies for Building Business Intelligence and Consumer Confidence. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The understanding that trust is contextual (has a scope) is a foundation of a collaborative filtering. =Operations= For a formal trust metric to be useful, it should define a set of operations over values of trust in such way that the result of those operations produce values of trust. Usually at least two elementary operators are considered: * fusion that provides a quasi-additive functionality, allowing to consolidate trust values coming from several sources; * discounting that provides a quasi-multiplicative functionality, allowing the advice/trust opinion provided by a source to be discounted as a function of the trust in the source, which is the principle for transitive trust computation. The exact semantics of both operators are specific to the metric. Even within one representation, there is still a possibility for a variety of semantic interpretations. For example, for the representation as the logic for uncertain probabilities, trust fusion operations can be interpreted by applying different rules (Cumulative fusion, averaging fusion, constraint fusion (Dempster's rule), Yager's modified Dempster's rule, Inagaki's unified combination rule, Zhang's centre combination rule, Dubois and Prade's disjunctive consensus rule etc.). Each interpretations leads to different results, depending on the assumptions for trust fusion in the particular situatation to be modelled. See Sentz, K. (2002) Combination of Evidence in Dempster‚ÄìShafer Theory . PhD Thesis.J√∏sang, A. (2016) for detailed discussions. =Scalability= The growing size of networks of trust make scalability another desired property, meaning that it is computationally feasible to calculate the metric for large networks. Scalability usually puts two requirements of the metric: * The elementary operation (e.g. fusion or discount) is computationally feasible, e.g. that relationships between context of trust can be quickly established. * The number of elementary operations scale slowly with the growth of the network. =Attack resistance= Attack resistance is an important non-functional property of trust metrics which reflects their ability not to be overly influenced by agents who try to manipulate the trust metric and who participate in bad faith (i.e. who aim to abuse the presumption of trust). The free software developer resource Advogato is based on a novel approach to attack-resistant trust metrics of Raph Levien. Levien observed that Google's PageRank algorithm can be understood to be an attack resistant trust metric rather similar to that behind Advogato.

Hakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mount Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons. Geography Hakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi. =Surrounding municipalities= Kanagawa Prefecture *Odawara *Yugawara *Minami-ashigara Shizuoka Prefecture *Gotemba *Susono *Mishima *Oyama *Kannami History Hakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H≈çj≈ç clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T≈çkaid≈ç highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the , which formed the border of the Kant≈ç region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T≈çkaid≈ç were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons. After the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake. After merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries. Economy Lake Ashi from Hakone Ropeway, a major tourist attraction in Hakone The economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active ≈åwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights. Hakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art. Major events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T≈çkaid≈ç road. One famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish≈ç and early Sh≈çwa periods. A noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi. Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association.

Initially, the primary role of REACT volunteers was to monitor Channel 9, the CB Emergency Channel, to help motorists. Later, duties grew to include communications after disasters (such as tornadoes and floods), and in some places before disasters (storm spotting). As well, REACT safety communications for parades, runs/walks and other community events became prominent. Now, REACT Teams rarely use CB primarily, a large percentage have now added amateur, FRS, GMRS, Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS), Trunked radio systems and business band radio (LMR) to their public service capabilities. Their original purpose, to monitor CB, has largely gone by the wayside.  Services Provided  Each REACT Team is unique and fills a local purpose. The original purpose of monitoring Emergency Channel 9 for distress calls is not as needed as once was due to the availability of cellular phones, but is still done in some remote locations. Some teams disbanded when the need for CB 9 monitoring waned; however, other Teams became creative and found other things to do in their communities. Many REACT Teams go beyond just communications and provide services such as traffic and parking control, search and rescue support, assistance with large public events, helping with safety breaks along roadways, help monitor traffic flow, assist with their local emergency management offices, law enforcement and also some participate in the Skywarn program of storm spotters. However many of these functions require the mobile communications that many REACT Teams utilize.  Objectives  *(a) To develop the use of the personal radio services as an additional source of communications for emergencies. disasters, and as an emergency aid to individuals;REACT International, Inc., Bylaws *(b) To establish 24-hour volunteer monitoring of emergency calls, particularly over officially designated emergency frequencies, from personal radio service operators, and reporting such calls to appropriate emergency authorities; *(c) To promote transportation safety by developing programs that provide information and communications assistance to motorists; *(d) To coordinate efforts with and provide communication help to other groups, e.g., Red Cross, Emergency Management, and local, state, and federal authorities, during emergencies and disasters; *(e) To develop, administer, and promote public information projects demonstrating and publicizing the potential benefits and the proper use of the personal radio service to individuals, organizations, industry, and government; and *(f) To participate in citizens crime prevention programs where established by appropriate law enforcement agencies.  History  1962 - A sick infant, a disabled car on a Chicago freeway, and a January blizzard prompted Henry B. (Pete) Kreer to envision using CB radio to get help in such emergencies.

The scanner works as a deterministic finite automaton. It supports Unicode characters in UTF-8 encoding and can be made case-sensitive or case-insensitive. It can also recognize tokens based on their right-hand- side context. In addition to terminal symbols the scanner can also recognize pragmas, which are tokens that are not part of the syntax but can occur anywhere in the input stream (e.g. compiler directives or end-of-line characters). The parser uses recursive descent; LL(1) conflicts can be resolved by either a multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic checks. Thus the class of accepted grammars is LL(k) for an arbitrary k. Fuzzy parsing is supported by so-called ANY symbols that match complementary sets of tokens. Semantic actions are written in the same language as the generated scanner and parser. The parser's error handling can be tuned by specifying synchronization points and \\"weak symbols\\" in the grammar. Coco/R checks the grammar for completeness, consistency, non-redundancy as well as for LL(1) conflicts. There are versions of Coco/R for Java, C#, C++, Pascal, Modula-2, Modula-3, Delphi, VB.NET, Python, Ruby and other programming languages. The latest versions from the University of Linz are those for C#, Java and C++. For the Java version, there is an Eclipse plug-in and for C#, a Visual Studio plug-in.

He was Prime Minister of Norway from 1931 until his death in 1932.  Early life and education  Born to a farmer's family in Borge, now part of Fredrikstad in √òstfold county he got a degree from Kalnes school of agriculture in 1899 and a degree from the Agricultural University of Norway at √Ös, Akershus county in 1902. He subsequently worked as teachers at agricultural schools in Asker, Akershus county and Nedenes, Aust- Agder county. Returning to √òstfold and Kalnes school of agriculture in 1905, he became principal at the school in 1912.  Early political and organizational career  In √òstfold, Kolstad became engaged in organisational work related to agriculture. He served as leader of the Tune chapter of the Norwegian Agrarian Association, became leader of the √òstfold county chapter and member of the national board of the organisation. He also sat on the board of the agricultural cooperative Felleskj√∏pet.Sigvat Skalds gate ‚Äì Wergelands gate Sarpsborg.com. Retrieved 6 February 2014 In the period from 1919 to 1922, he was part of the herredsstyre (selective body of the municipal council) in Tune. He was a member of the municipal council until 1928 and leader of the √òstfold chapter of the Farmer's Party for several years in the 1920s. At the Agrarian Association's congress in Kristiansand in 1920, he played an important role in the process that led to the decision that the organization should nominate its own list in the 1921 Norwegian parliamentary election, leading to the establishment of the Farmer's Party.Gabrielsen (1970), p. 12 In the 1921 Norwegian parliamentary election, Kolstad topped the list for the Farmers' Party in √òstfold and was elected to the Parliament of Norway and subsequently re-elected in all elections until his death. He served in the Standing Committee on Finance in all his parliamentary career, becoming head of the committee in 1928. He served as secretary for the Farmers' Party's parliamentary group in all his years in Parliament and was elected President of the Odelsting in 1931. In this period, he also headed the √òstfold chapter of the Farmer's Party for several years. As finance politician, Kolstad like his party argued for austerity, in particular he wanted to reduce public administrationGabrielsen (1970), p. 17 He led the majority in the Farmer's Party that supported the Liberal Mowinckel's Cabinet's decision to return the Norwegian krone to the gold standard in 1928 after convertibility had been suspended after World War I.Gabrielsen (1970), p. 42  As prime minister  Mowinckel's Cabinet's decision to grant the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever Concession to acquire half the shares in the Norwegian company Lilleborg caused a political crisis in 1931, leading to the resignation of the cabinet and the formation of the first cabinet from the Farmer's Party.Gabrielsen (1970), pp. 64‚Äì67 The Farmers' Party had only 25 of the 150 seats in the Parliament; the weakest foundation for a cabinet in Norway to that date.Borgen (1978), p. 241 The cabinet would seek support in the parliament from the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. The party chose Kolstad as prime minister instead of the party leader Jens Hundseid to a large degree because he was seen as being moderate and better at cooperating with other parties and politicians than Hundseid.Gabrielsen (1970), pp. 70‚Äì71 The party also saw it as an advantage that he was well versed in financial policies. = Formation of the cabinet = Never having been in government before, the party lacked experienced persons for the ministerial positions. The Cabinet had 10 members. Kolstad took the position of Minister of Finance in addition to being prime minister. He set as an ultimatum that Jon Sundby should take the position as Minister of Agriculture;Gabrielsen (1978), p. 74 Sundby himself originally wanted to stay in the Parliament as leader of the Standing Committee on Agriculture. A controversial choice was major Vidkun Quisling as Minister of Defence. Quisling had not been involved in party politics and Sundby did not personally know him. Kolstad stated that Quisling's knowledge about Russia as demonstrated in his writings would be useful for the cabinet.Gabrielsen (1978), pp. 75‚Äì78 = The Lilleborg case = The Mowincel Cabinet had granted the Norwegian company Lilleborg concession to buy De-No-Fa's oil mill in Fredrikstad and at the same time given concession for De-No-Fa, which was 50% owned by the Dutch company Unilever, to acquire half the shared in Lilleborg. This would give Unilever control over Lilleborg. While the Farmer's party opposed the concession as they wanted to protect Norwegian ownership of industry and it led to the fall of the Mowinkel Cabinet, Kolstad's Cabinet found it impossible to revoke the concession. De-No-Fa stated the mill would have to close without a concession and at the same time De-No-Fa and Unilever had negotiated a new contract which would give Unilever control over Lilleborg even without a concession.Nielsen (2001), p. 178 On 10 July 1931, the Kolstad cabinet confirmed the concession that the Mowinckel's Cabinet had already given.Gabrielsen (1978), pp. 81‚Äì82 = Eastern Greenland dispute= On 26 May 1923, the newly established Det Norske Ishavsr√•d (English: The Norwegian Arctic Council) published a proposal to that Norway should claim sovereignty over part of the area near Scoresbysund. Norwegian whalers and trappers stayed in the area. The Farmer's Party had a post in their program that Norway should assert historical rights in Greenland and whaling interest in the Arctic Oceans, but Kolstad was still initially negative to the proposal.Borgen (1978), pp. 240‚Äì241 In June the same year, the cabinet got a telegram from Hallvard Devold who led a Norwegian expedition in Greenland which stated that Norwegians had occupied Myggbukta and declared the nearby area for Norwegian territory, calling it Erik the Red's Land. After multiple cabinet discussions, the cabinet issued a royal declaration on 10 July 1931 where Eastern Greenland was claimed as Norwegian territory. The decision was met with condemnation from the Labour Party. Denmark contested the claim and brought the case to the International Court of Justice where they won in 1933. = The Menstad conflict = When Kolstad formed the cabinet in May 1931, the industry in Norway had been marked by strikes and lock-out since March. In Menstad near Porsgrunn, Norsk Hydro hired temporary workers to unload a number of ships. The union considered those workers to be strikebreakers. The cabinet sent 120 police officers to protect the workers. After the police officers were attacked by stones and sticks on 8 June, the cabinet sent military forces to the place ‚Äì soldiers and four vessels ‚Äì which calmed the situation.Gabrielsen (1978), pp. 82‚Äì83 Although Quisling was not prominent in making the decision, as Minister of Defence the non-socialist parties gave him most of the credit while he became considered an enemy by the labour movement. = Economic and agricultural policies = To support Norwegian farmers, the cabinet proposed that all margarine sold in Norway should contain a certain percentage of butter. This was legalized in the Parliament in June 1923. The cabinet also proposed to increase the subsidies to farmers that produced corn. The Liberal Party initially opposed the increase, but after Kolstad threatened to resign over the issue a compromise was reached.Gabrielsen (1978), pp. 88‚Äì89 Following the United Kingdom's decision to leave the gold standard in September 1923, the Kolstad cabinet decided to abandon the standard the same month. At the same time, the cabinet devaluated the Norwegian krone which sank more than most other currencies in Europe, which helped the Norwegian export.Gabrielsen (1978), pp. 91‚Äì92 In December 1923, Kolstad was informed that the large banks Bergens Privatbank and Den norske Creditbank were in grave financial troubles. The cabinet and a majority in the Parliament backed a plan by the Norwegian Central Bank to help the bank with liquidity, but Kolstad blamed the Central Bank for not having addressed the problem at an earlier stage and argued in favour of more political influence over the Central Bank.Gabrielsen (1978), p. 92  Health problems and death  Kolstad suffered various health problems during his time as prime minister and was hospitalised in January 1932. He died of a blood clot on 5 March 1932. Jens Hundseid became prime minister for a new Farmers' party government on 14 March.Norsk Biografisk LeksikonPeder Kolstad Regjeringen.no.

It was established in 1953 and is part of the Northfield Township High School District 225. In 2018, it was ranked the 48th-best public high school in the United States by Niche.  History  Glenbrook North High School in Northbrook Glenbrook North High School opened its doors in the fall of 1953 as Glenbrook High School, and was renamed Glenbrook North in 1962 after the opening of Glenbrook South High School. Glenbrook North has grown fourfold in the size of its student body since its founding. In 1979, the school opened the Sheely Center for the Performing Arts, and in 1990, a fieldhouse was dedicated. In the spring of 1996, a three-year renovation and construction project involving the science facilities and the ‚ÄúA‚Äù wing was built. A second swimming pool was built in 2000 to accommodate the burgeoning growth in aquatics. A successful referendum in 2006 enabled the creation of the two- story classroom ‚ÄúF‚Äù wing, state of the art Fitness Center, complete renovation and additions to the Music Area, and a sun-filled main entrance, which were completed in 2009. Throughout the years, Glenbrook North High School has received state and national recognition for its academic excellence. In the late 1950s, when Glenbrook was less than 10 years old, it was named one of the top 44 high schools in the country by a survey in a national magazine. In 1984, GBN was named one of only four high schools in the state of Illinois to receive the United States Office of Education Excellence in Education Award from President Ronald Reagan. In 2008, GBN was selected again for the nation's top distinction as a Blue Ribbon School. = John Hughes films = John Hughes was an alumnus who used the school in his films. The two best-known movies filmed at this high school were The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Hughes' 1985 film The Breakfast Club featured a group of kids from \\"Shermer, Illinois 60062.\\" Shermerville was the original name of the town of Northbrook, where GBN is located, and 60062 is the town's zip code. The movie features the clash between what was known during the 1980s as the 'sporto' versus 'freak' cultures at GBN. Some interior scenes of The Breakfast Club were filmed inside Glenbrook North, and exterior shots of GBN were used in both The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. = President Clinton visit = On January 22, 1997, President Bill Clinton visited the school to deliver a speech about education initiatives. It was held in the school's fieldhouse and largely centered around mathematics and science. At the time, students in Northern Illinois were participating in a program called \\"First in the World.\\" The program was to judge the level of knowledge in math and science against other schools around the world. Northern Illinois students scored 1st in the Science category and 3rd in the Mathematics category. Remarking about Glenbrook High School District 225, President Clinton said: > Can you imagine a school district or a set of school districts with more > genuine local control than this one, with‚Äîmore than these‚Äî more parental > involvement, more committed teachers, more‚Äîyou know, you've got local > control.

The event was a \\"Powder Puff\\" girls' football game between members of the junior and senior classes. The \\"game\\" took place on May 4, 2003, in Chipilly Woods, part of the Cook County Forest Preserve District. Although the annual Powder Puff game had been held at the school's football stadium in earlier decades, there was no football at the 2003 event. During the event, about 20 junior class participants were covered in paint, urine, feces, and animal guts. Some were shot with paintball guns, others were kicked and beaten. At least five participants sustained injuries requiring medical attention. Thirty-one students ‚Äì twenty-eight females and three males ‚Äì were suspended from school for 10 days. They were later expelled. Some of the expelled students and their parents filed a lawsuit to allow the expelled students to graduate. The plaintiffs and the school district reached an agreement where the expelled students would have their diplomas mailed to them but would not be able to participate in graduation ceremonies.Black, Lisa & Flynn, Courtney; Former students link teachers to hazings ; Grease supplied, court papers say; June 5, 2003; p. 6; Chicago Tribune; accessed May 8, 2009 Local law enforcement authorities investigated the hazing incident and filed charges against 15 students for assault and battery. Two mothers were charged with providing alcohol for the event. All were convicted and the sentences received were light, ranging from probation to community service.Northbrook teen guilty in hazing; September 25, 2003; p. 6; Chicago Tribune; accessed May 8, 2009 A community-wide task force was established by the Northbrook Police Department Community Services Division after the hazing incident. Their final report stressed the needs for recognizing and preventing hazing incidents.  Academics  The academic school year consists of 37 weeks divided into two semesters. It has a block schedule with classes meeting on alternating days and each school day consists of four blocks of 90 minutes each. The summer school program at Glenbrook North is six weeks in length. In 2017, the school graduated 98.4% of its senior class, which had an average composite ACT score of 27.1, and 89.5% enrolled in college. The 2017 class included 21 National Merit Semifinalists. The student-to-teacher ratio is 11.54 to 1. In 2018, it was ranked the 48th best public high school in the United States by Niche. In 2016, it was ranked 23rd on the public high schools with the best teachers in America by Business Insider. = Debate = The school's debate team was ranked the top debate school of the 20th century based on performance in the National Speech and Debate Association. The school has won numerous state and national championships in Policy Debate, as well as state championships in Lincoln-Douglas and Public Forum Debate. It is the only high school debate program in the country to have ever won the debate's \\"Triple Crown,\\" sweeping the National Speech and Debate Association Tournament, the Tournament of Champions, and the Grand National Speech and Debate Tournament in 2004. Since 1974, it has won at least one national championship in debate in fourteen individual years. It has also won an Illinois High School Association (IHSA) state championship in 18 of the 35 years since 1982, and has placed as runner up in three of those years. = Athletics = The school is a member of the Central Suburban League and the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). William Lutz Stadium, which is the home of the Glenbrook North's football, lacrosse, track & field and soccer teams, is named in honor of William Lutz, the school's first athletic director. The school sponsors interscholastic teams for boys and girls in basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming & diving, lacrosse, tennis, track & field, volleyball, and water polo. Boys may also compete in baseball, football, and wrestling. Girls may compete in badminton, cheerleading, and softball. In 2005, the school became the first large-enrollment high school in Illinois to have won a state championship in each of football, basketball and baseball. The following GBN teams have won IHSA sponsored state championship tournaments in the listed years: * Baseball: 1966, 1974 * Basketball (boys): 2005 * Football: 1974 * Hockey: 1984, 1985, 2007, 2008, 2015 * Soccer (boys): 1983 * Swimming & Diving (girls): 1978 * Tennis (boys): 1981, 1999, 2006 * Volleyball (boys): 1993  Basketball  On December 28, 2005, the school's basketball program gained national media attention when Jon Scheyer scored 21 points in the final 75 seconds of a comeback attempt against Proviso West. Scheyer fell one point short of the Glenbrook North basketball record for most points in a game, scoring 52 points.  Hockey  Glenbrook North Hockey, a club team, won back-to-back state titles in 1984 and 1985, becoming the first varsity hockey team in Illinois to do so, and repeating the feat in 2007 and 2008. In 2011, 2013, and 2014, the team returned to the title game but lost to the New Trier Trevians. In 2015, it defeated Benet Academy in the state title game in overtime, 3‚Äì2.

After the Meiji restoration, the Shogunal and hatamoto holdings became part of the short-lived Nirayama Prefecture, which merged with Kanagawa Prefecture in 1869. The Odawara-ruled portion became part of the equally short-lived Odawara Prefecture, which merged into Ashigaru Prefecture in 1871, and then into Kanagawa Prefecture in 1876.

In Game 7, Bill Mazeroski hit a walk-off ninth-inning home run, the only time a winner-take-all World Series game ended with a walk-off home run. Despite losing the series, the Yankees scored 55 runs, the most runs scored by any one team in World Series history, and more than twice as many as the Pirates, who scored 27. The Yankees won three blowouts (16‚Äì3, 10‚Äì0, and 12‚Äì0), while the Pirates won four close games (6‚Äì4, 3‚Äì2, 5‚Äì2, and 10‚Äì9) to win the series. The Series MVP was Bobby Richardson of the Yankees, the only time in history that the award has been given to a member of the losing team, though the rules were different at this time. Votes had to be in by the start of the 8th inning of Game 7, at which point the Yankees were in the lead, and this was the first time since the series MVP award was created in 1955 that the team leading at that point did not go on to win. This World Series featured seven past, present, or future league Most Valuable Players. The Pirates had two ‚Äì Dick Groat (1960) and Roberto Clemente (1966) ‚Äì while the Yankees had five: Yogi Berra (1951, 1954, 1955), Bobby Shantz (1952), Mickey Mantle (1956, 1957, 1962), Roger Maris (1960, 1961), and Elston Howard (1963). As noted in the superstition called the \\"Ex-Cubs Factor\\", this was the only Series after 1945 and until 2001 in which a team with three or more former members of the Chicago Cubs (Don Hoak, Smoky Burgess, and Gene Baker) was able to win a World Series. The World Championship for the Pirates was their third overall and first since 1925. Summary Statue commemorating Mazeroski's walk-off home run in Pittsburgh The Yankees, winners of their 10th pennant in 12 years, outscored the Pirates 55‚Äì27 in this Series, out-hit them 91‚Äì60, out- batted them .338 to .256, hit 10 home runs to Pittsburgh's four (three of which came in Game 7), got two complete-game shutouts from Whitey Ford‚Äîand lost. The Pirates' inconsistent pitching and Stengel's controversial decision not to start Ford in Games 1 and 4 resulted in the peculiar combination of close games and routs. Ford (Games 3 and 6) and Vern Law (Games 1 and 4) were excellent, while Pirates relief pitcher Roy Face was a major factor in Games 1, 4 and 5. Matchups =Game 1= Dick Groat The Yankees threw Art Ditmar against the Pirates' Vern Law (the NL Cy Young Award winner) in Game 1. In the top of the first inning, New York right fielder Roger Maris, the eventual 1960 AL MVP, drilled a home run off Law to give the Yankees a 1‚Äì0 lead. In the bottom half, however, the Pirates evened the score when Bill Virdon walked, stole second, advanced to third on an error by shortstop Tony Kubek, and scored on a double by Dick Groat (the eventual 1960 NL MVP). Bob Skinner then singled to drive in Groat and stole second, coming home on a single by Roberto Clemente. Pittsburgh now led 3‚Äì1. This was enough to compel Casey Stengel, the Yankee manager, to pull Ditmar in favor of Jim Coates, who finished the inning. In the fourth, New York cut the lead to one run when Maris singled, moved to second on a Mickey Mantle walk, took third on a fly out by Yogi Berra, and scored on a single by Bill Skowron. But the Pirates extended their lead to 5‚Äì2 in the fourth when Don Hoak walked and Bill Mazeroski homered. Pittsburgh added an insurance run in the sixth when Mazeroski doubled with one out and scored on Virdon's double off Duke Maas, and although the Yankees cut the lead in half on a ninth-inning 2-run home run to right field by Elston Howard, reliever Roy Face successfully closed it out to give the Pirates a 6‚Äì4 victory and a 1‚Äì0 series lead. =Game 2= Mickey Mantle Game 2, matching New York's Bob Turley against the Pirates' Bob Friend, saw the Yankees pummel Pittsburgh 16‚Äì3. The game was scoreless until the top of the third, when the Yankees jumped out to a 2‚Äì0 lead. Second baseman Bobby Richardson walked, was sacrificed over to second by Turley, and scored on a single by Tony Kubek. Gil McDougald then doubled, plating Kubek all the way from first base. Turley aided his own cause with an RBI single in the fourth, driving home Richardson, who had singled and moved to second on a passed ball. Although Hoak doubled home Gino Cimoli in the bottom of the fourth to break the shutout, the Yankees extended their lead to 5‚Äì1 courtesy of a two-run home run by Mantle off Fred Green. In the sixth, the solid Yankee lead turned into a rout. Elston Howard hit a lead-off triple and scored on Bobby Richardson's double to chase Green from the game. Clem Labine replaced Green. A passed ball by Smoky Burgess and error by shortstop Dick Groat on Tony Kubek's ground ball put runners on first and third with one out before McDougald's RBI single made it 7‚Äì1 Yankees. After a walk and strikeout, Yogi Berra's two-run single and Bill Skowron's RBI single made it 10‚Äì1 Yankees. Red Witt relieved Labine and allowed back-to-back RBI singles to Howard and Richardson that made it 12‚Äì1 Yankees. Mantle continued the onslaught by blasting a three-run home run in the seventh off Joe Gibbon and scoring on a wild pitch by Tom Cheney in the ninth after walking and moving to third on a double, making it 16‚Äì1 Yankees. Although the Pirates tacked on two runs in the bottom half of the frame on back-to-back RBI singles by Gino Cimoli and Smoky Burgess, Bobby Shantz relieved Turley and got Don Hoak to hit into the game-ending double play. This decisive Yankee victory tied the series at a game apiece. This game shares a peculiar World Series record with 2002's Game 5, the most runs scored by a game-winning team who ultimately went on to lose the series. =Game 3= Bobby Richardson For Game 3, the Series shifted to Yankee Stadium as Stengel sent Whitey Ford to the mound against Pittsburgh's Vinegar Bend Mizell. Ford had somewhat of an off year (12‚Äì9, 3.08 ERA and 192.2 IP) for his lofty standards, but was brilliant against the Pirates. The Yankees continued the offensive onslaught they displayed in Game 2, grabbing a 6‚Äì0 lead by the end of the first inning. Mizell would only get one batter out. After two singles, Bill Skowron drove in the first run with an RBI single. After a walk loaded the bases, Elston Howard added another run with an RBI single off Clem Labine before Bobby Richardson capped the scoring with a grand slam (during the regular season, Richardson had hit only one home run, off Baltimore's Arnie Portocarrero on April 30). In the fourth, the Bombers added on four more runs, courtesy of a two-run home run by Mickey Mantle off Fred Green and, after three singles loaded the bases, a two-run single by Richardson off Red Witt. The Pirates, meanwhile, simply could not get anything going against Ford, who tossed a masterful four-hitter. The Yankees now led the series 2‚Äì1. =Game 4= Vernon Law The Pirates had seen their pitching fail them in the last two games, as the team fell victim to the powerful Yankee bats. This was not the case in Game 4, however, as Pittsburgh sent Game 1 winner Vern Law to the hill against Ralph Terry. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fourth, when Bill Skowron launched a home run off Law to give New York a 1‚Äì0 advantage. The very next half- inning, though, Pittsburgh stormed back, when with two on and two outs, Law doubled in Gino Cimoli to tie the game and Bill Virdon's two-run single put the Pirates up 3‚Äì1. Law kept the potent pinstripers at bay, though the Yankees did scratch and claw for a single run in the bottom of the seventh when Skowron doubled, moved to third on a single by McDougald, and scored on a fielder's choice on a ball hit by Richardson. After a pinch-hit single by Johnny Blanchard, Pirate manager Danny Murtaugh brought in reliever Roy Face, who held the fort for the final 2‚Öî innings as Pittsburgh tied the series at two. =Game 5= Roy Face With the series now tied at two, Yankee manager Casey Stengel started pitcher Art Ditmar, his Game 1 starter (in which he was ineffective), against the Pirates' Harvey Haddix, who had become famous for taking a perfect game into the thirteenth inning in a loss to the Milwaukee Braves the previous year. As it turned out, on this day Ditmar could not get out of the second inning once again. Dick Stuart singled and was forced out at second by Gino Cimoli, who then moved to third on a double by Smoky Burgess. Don Hoak then slapped a ground ball toward Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek, who flipped it to third baseman Gil McDougald in an attempt to retire Burgess, who was attempting to advance. However, McDougald dropped the ball for an error (Kubek's toss was accurate), allowing Cimoli to score, Burgess safe at third, and Hoak reaching second on the error. Bill Mazeroski then lashed a double to left, scoring Burgess and Hoak. After this offensive outburst, Stengel yanked Ditmar and replaced him with Luis Arroyo, who finally ended the inning and stranded Mazeroski. The next half-inning, New York picked up a run when Elston Howard doubled, moved to third on a ground-out by Bobby Richardson, and scored on another grounder by Kubek. However, the Pirates extended their lead back to three runs in the third, when Roberto Clemente singled home Groat, who led off with a double. In the bottom of the third, Roger Maris touched Haddix for a home run to deep right field. Otherwise, however, the Pittsburgh hurler was in fine form, holding the Yankees at bay until the seventh, when he was replaced by Face. In the ninth, the Pirates added an insurance run off Ryne Duren when Hoak singled in Joe Christopher (pinch runner for Smoky Burgess, who had singled and taken second on an error), who had moved to third on a wild pitch. Face then shut down the Yankees once again to give the Pirates a 5‚Äì2 victory and 3‚Äì2 series lead. =Game 6= Whitey Ford For the sixth contest in Pittsburgh, the Yankees started Whitey Ford against the Pirates' Bob Friend. And as was the case the last time Ford had toed the rubber for the Yanks in Game 3, his teammates relentlessly mashed the ball, en route to a resounding 12‚Äì0 victory. In the top of the second, the Yankees went to work. After a Yogi Berra walk and a Bill Skowron single, Elston Howard was hit by a pitch to load the bases (Eli Grba ran for him). Ford himself then notched the first RBI of the game, with a ground ball single to his counterpart Friend that scored Berra. The next inning, after a lead-off hit-by-pitch and double, Mantle cracked a two-run single that scored Tony Kubek and Roger Maris. After a Yogi Berra single moved Mantle to third, Pirates skipper Danny Murtaugh removed the clearly ineffective Friend in favor of Tom Cheney. Cheney, however, fared no better, as a Bill Skowron sacrifice fly scored Mantle and after a single, a triple to deep left field by Richardson scored Berra and Johnny Blanchard, making the score 6‚Äì0. The Yankees then ran away with the game, scoring two runs in each of the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings. In the sixth, Clete Boyer hit a lead-off triple off Fred Green and scored on Kubek's single. After another single, Berra's RBI single off Clem Labine made it 8‚Äì0 Yankees. Next inning, after a lead-off double by Blanchard, Richardson ripped his second RBI triple of the contest, and Ford added his second RBI courtesy of a fielder's choice on a sacrifice bunt. In the eighth, Berra hit an RBI single with a runner on second, and later scored on Blanchard's double. As in Game 3, Ford was his masterful self, not letting the Pirates mount anything resembling a rally for the full nine innings. His second shutout of the series was critical, as it forced Game 7. Manager Casey Stengel, though, came under some fire particularly later from Mickey Mantle in his autobiography for letting Ford finish this game instead of removing him once the Yankees had a comfortable lead, and thus, keeping him available out of the bullpen if needed in Game 7. =Game 7= Bill Mazeroski For the deciding seventh game, Bob Turley, the winning pitcher in Game 2, got the nod for the Yankees against the Pirates' Vern Law, the winning pitcher in Games 1 and 4. Turley lasted only one inning plus one batter. After retiring the first two batters, Turley walked Bob Skinner, then first baseman Rocky Nelson homered, Pittsburgh's first home run since Bill Mazeroski's in Game 1, to give the Pirates a 2‚Äì0 lead. Turley was then pulled after giving up a single to Smoky Burgess leading off the second. Don Hoak then drew a walk against Bill Stafford, and a bunt single by Mazeroski loaded the bases. Stafford appeared to get the Yankees out of trouble after inducing Law to hit into a double play, pitcher to catcher to first. But lead-off man Bill Virdon's single to right scored Hoak and Mazeroski and increased the Pirates' lead to 4‚Äì0. The Yankees got on the board in the fifth on Bill Skowron's lead-off home run, his second of the Series. In the sixth, Bobby Richardson led off with a single and Tony Kubek drew a walk. Elroy Face relieved Law and got Roger Maris to pop out to Hoak in foul territory, but Mickey Mantle singled to score Richardson. Yogi Berra followed with a three-run shot to right that gave the Yankees their first lead, 5‚Äì4. The Yankees extended their lead to 7‚Äì4 in the eighth. With two out, Berra walked, and Skowron singled when the Pirates couldn't get a force-out. Johnny Blanchard (who had replaced Elston Howard at catcher for game 7) then singled to score Berra, and Clete Boyer doubled to score Skowron. But the Pirates retook the lead with a 5-run eighth inning. Gino Cimoli (pinch-hitting for Face) led off with a single, and Virdon hit a ground ball to short for what could have been a double play. But the ball instead took a bad hop and hit Kubek in the throat, leaving everybody safe and causing Kubek to leave the game. Dick Groat then chased Bobby Shantz (who had entered the game in the third and had pitched five innings, having not pitched more than four in any game during the regular season) with a single to score Cimoli and send Virdon to second. Jim Coates relieved Shantz and got Skinner out on a sacrifice bunt, which moved the runners up. Nelson followed with a fly ball to right, and Virdon declined to challenge Maris' throwing arm. Coates then got two quick strikes on Roberto Clemente and was a strike away from getting the Yankees out of their most serious trouble of the afternoon, when Clemente hit a Baltimore chop towards first; first baseman Skowron and Coates both tried to get to the ball at the same time, and Clemente's speed forced Skowron to just hold the ball as Coates could not make it to first base in time to cover. The high chopper allowed Virdon to score, cutting the Yankee lead to 7‚Äì6. Hal Smith, who had replaced Smoky Burgess at catcher after being pinch-ran for by Joe Christopher followed with a three-run home run to give the Pirates a 9‚Äì7 lead. Game 4 loser Ralph Terry relieved Coates and got the last out. Bob Friend, an 18-game winner for the Pirates and their starter (and loser) in Games 2 and 6, came on in the ninth to try to protect the lead. Bobby Richardson and pinch- hitter Dale Long both greeted him with singles, and Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh was forced to remove the veteran pitcher in favor of Harvey Haddix. Although he got Roger Maris to foul out, Haddix gave up a key single to Mickey Mantle that scored Richardson and moved Long to third. Yogi Berra followed, hitting a short grounder to first, with Rocky Nelson easily getting the second out. In what, at the moment, stood as a monumental play, Mantle, seeing he had no chance to beat a play at second (and thinking the ball was caught in the air), scurried back to first and avoided Nelson's tag (which would have been the third out) as Gil McDougald (pinch-running for Long) raced home to tie the game at 9. Had he been out on the play, the run would still have counted if it had scored before the tag (but the play happened quickly). With Mantle safe, the inning continued, but ended when Bill Skowron hit into a force play. Ralph Terry returned to the mound in the bottom of the ninth. The first batter to face him was Bill Mazeroski. With a count of one ball and no strikes, the Pirates' second baseman smashed a historic long drive over the left field wall (left fielder Berra had no chance to catch it despite following it to the wall), winning the game 10‚Äì9 and crowning the Pirates as World Series champions. As the Pirates erupted, the Yankees stood across the field in stunned disbelief. The improbable champions were outscored, out-hit, and outplayed, but somehow had managed to pull out a Game 7 victory. Years later, Mickey Mantle was quoted in Ken Burns' documentary Baseball as saying that losing the 1960 series was the only loss, amateur or professional, he cried actual tears over. For Bill Mazeroski, by contrast, his Series-clinching home run was the highlight of a Hall of Fame career otherwise notable mostly for excellent defense. Mazeroski became the first player to hit a game-ending home run in Game 7 to win a World Series. Thirty-three years later, Joe Carter would become the only other player to end the World Series with a home run, doing so for the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series against the Pirates' in-state rivals, the Philadelphia Phillies, albeit in Game 6. Although most noted for the series-ending homer, Game 7 is also the only game in all of postseason history with no strikeouts recorded by either side. The Giants in the 2002 World Series failed to strike out an Angels batter in Game 2, but the Angels' pitching staff struck out eight Giants. Bobby Richardson of the Yankees was named MVP of the Series, the only time someone from the losing team has been so honored. Key plays Prior to Bill Mazeroski‚Äôs walk-off home run, the outcome of the game hinged on at least four key plays in the late innings: * Top 8th, 2 out, runner on 1st; Yankees led 5‚Äì4 (Yankees batting): Bill Skowron‚Äôs Baltimore Chop could have ended the inning; instead the Yankees got two more hits and extended their lead to 7‚Äì4. * Bottom 8th, 0 out, runner on 1st; Yankees led 7‚Äì4 (Pirates batting): A potential double-play groundball took a bad hop and hit Tony Kubek in the face; instead of potentially 2 out and nobody on base, the Pirates had two runners on and nobody out. * Bottom 8th, 2 out, runners on 2nd & 3rd; Yankees led 7‚Äì5 (Pirates batting): Roberto Clemente‚Äôs Baltimore Chop could have ended the inning; instead a run scored and the next batter, Hal Smith, hit a three-run home run, which gave Pittsburgh the lead, 9‚Äì7. * Top 9th, 1 out, runners on 1st and 3rd; Pirates led 9‚Äì8 (Yankees batting): Yogi Berra‚Äôs groundball could have been turned into a double play, which would have ended the game; instead, after Rocky Nelson stepped on first for one out, Mickey Mantle dove back safely into first, allowing the tying run to score. Game 7 telecast Prior to the mid-1970s, television networks and stations generally did not preserve their telecasts of sporting events, choosing instead to tape over them. As a result, the broadcasts of the first six games are no longer known to exist. The lone exception is a black-and-white kinescope of the entire telecast of Game 7, which was discovered in a wine cellar in Bing Crosby's former home in Hillsborough, California in December 2009. A part-owner of the Pirates who was too superstitious to watch the Series live, Crosby listened to the decisive contest with his wife Kathryn and two friends on a shortwave radio in Paris, France. Wanting to watch the game at a later date only if the Pirates won, he arranged for the telecast to be recorded by Ampex, in which he also held a financial investment. After viewing the kinescope, he placed it in his wine cellar, where it sat untouched for 49 years. It was finally found by Robert Bader, vice-president of marketing and production for Bing Crosby Enterprises, while looking through videotapes of Crosby's television specials which were to be transferred to DVD. The five-reel set is the only known complete copy of the historic game, which was originally broadcast in color.Higgins, Bill. \\"Throwback Thursday: Bing Crosby Took a Swing at Baseball in the 1940s,\\" The Hollywood Reporter, July 25, 2014. The NBC television announcers for the Series were Bob Prince and Mel Allen, the primary play-by- play voices for the Pirates and Yankees respectively. Prince called the first half of Game 7 and conducted post-game interviews in the Pittsburgh clubhouse, while Allen did the latter portion of the game. 50th Anniversary celebrations The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette October 13, 2010, a 50th anniversary reprint of the Pirates' Game 7 victory On October 13, 2010, for the 50th anniversary of the series winning home run, a gala was hosted by the Byham Theater in downtown Pittsburgh, where the historic telecast of Game 7 was re-aired in its entirety. Bill Virdon, 1960 MVP Dick Groat and Yankee Bobby Richardson were guest speakers, with actor and Pittsburgh native Jeff Goldblum hosting the event. The MLB Network would air the game and gala on December 15, 2010. The telecast was also released on DVD by A&E; Home Video. Composite box 1960 World Series (4‚Äì3): Pittsburgh Pirates (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.) Aftermath This would prove to be Casey Stengel's last World Series, as the Yankee club soon sent him into retirement. This led to his famous remark, \\"I'll never make the mistake of turning 70 again.\\" Mazeroski and Clemente were the last two remaining Pirate players from the 1960 World Series winners along with manager Danny Murtaugh and third-base coach Frank Oceak, when the Pirates won the World Series in 1971. To date, this is the last championship in any of the four major sports to be won in Pittsburgh by the home team, as the Pirates' two subsequent World Series championships were clinched in Baltimore, while the Pittsburgh Penguins have won all five of their Stanley Cup titles on the road and the Pittsburgh Steelers have won all six of their Super Bowl championships at neutral sites.

He worked in several different styles, as represented by his five artistic periods.  Biography  He was born in Quebec City, where he also died. He was raised in Quebec City until 1916, when his family moved to Berkeley, California. In 1917, the family returned to Quebec and settled in Montreal. From 1926 to 1934, Jean Paul Lemieux studied under Edwin Holgate and others at the Montreal School of Fine Arts. In 1929, he traveled to Europe with his mother. In Paris, he studied advertising and art and met other artists. Lemieux took teaching positions from 1934, first at his former school, then in 1935 at the √âcole du meuble. In 1937, he moved to Quebec City and taught at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Qu√©bec until his retirement in 1965. His connections at that period include other major artists associated with these schools, such as Alfred Pellan and Paul-√âmile Borduas. In 1960, works by Lemieux along with Edmund Alleyn, Graham Coughtry, Frances Loring and Albert Dumouchel represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. = Awards and honors = Jean Paul Lemieux received several awards for his works, including the Louis-Philippe H√©bert prize in 1971 and the Molson Prize for the Canada Council for the Arts in 1974. In 1968, he became a Companion of the Order of Canada. He was also a member of the Royal Canadian Academy. In 1997, he was posthumously made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec.  Artistic career  Lemieux was a representational artist whose painting career sometimes had echoes of folk art but, in 1956, at the age of 52, he changed his subject matter and refined his technique. The paintings which followed are among his best known. They usually feature emblematic scenes of French Canada, often combined with a sense of the vast spaces of his homeland. = Works - a selection = La m√©decine √† Qu√©bec, mural, 1957 *Marine, Baie Saint-Paul, 1935 *Notre-Dame prot√©geant Qu√©bec, 1941 *Portrait de l‚Äôartiste √† Beauport-Est, 1943 *Le Far West, 1955 *Les Parques, 1962 *L‚Äô√©t√© de 1914, 1965 *Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh, 1979 *Dies Irae, 1982‚Äì83 = The five periods = The Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec and other sources divide Lemieux's career into five periods: * Montreal period (1926‚Äì1937), marked by realistic naturalism influenced by Quebec regionalism and, later, European post impressionism. * Primitive period (1940‚Äì1947), focused on anecdote and accumulated scenic detail. * Minimalist period (1951‚Äì1955), with cubist structures, which signaled a major turning point in the artist's career. * Classical period (1956‚Äì1970), with a figures fuelled by the sources and practices of abstract art (MNBAQ). It is in this period that Lemieux produced the paintings of lonely figures in desolate, bleak landscapes for which he is so well known today. * Expressionist period (after 1970), presenting humanity living in a post nuclear attack world.  Legacy  Jean-Paul Lemieux monument in Qu√©bec, Canada A set of postage stamps depicting three works by Lemieux, Self-portrait (1974), June Wedding (1972) and Summer (1959) were issued by Canada Post on October 22, 2004. The stamps were released on the day that a retrospective of his work organized to recognize the centenary of the artist's birth opened at the National Gallery of Canada. A retrospective exhibition of his works from 1956 to 1979 took place at the Gallery Valentin in 2009.

Life = Career = Born in Vienna on 18 April 1863 into a wealthy noble family that owned lands in Moravia and Hungary, Berchtold's nationality has sometimes been subject of attention by historians as his aristocratic bloodlines made him part German, part Czech, part Slovak and part Hungarian. An anecdote of this identity dilemma can be found on 'Graf Leopold Berchtold von und zu Ungarsch√ºtz, Fr√§ttling, und P√ºll√ºtz', Solving Problems Through Force he was reputed to be one of Austria-Hungary's richest men. Tutored at home, he later studied law and joined the Austro-Hungarian foreign service in 1893. In the same year, he married Countess Ferdinanda K√°rolyi (1868‚Äì1955), the daughter of one of the richest aristocrats in Hungary, in Budapest. He subsequently served at the embassies in Paris (1894), London (1899) and St. Petersburg (1903). In December 1906, Count Berchtold was appointed as the successor of Count Lexa von Aehrenthal as Ambassador to Russia upon the latter's appointment as Imperial Foreign Minister. He served with distinction for five years in St. Petersburg and experienced Russia's distrust and fear of Vienna. In September 1908, he hosted a secret meeting between Count Lexa von Aehrenthal and the Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky at his estate at Buchlau in Moravia. This meeting produced the so-called Buchlau bargain and led to the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the death of Count Lexa von Aehrenthal in February 1912, Count Berchtold was appointed as his successor and thus became, at the age of 49, the youngest foreign minister in Europe. His appointment reportedly came against his own will and despite lack of experience in domestic affairs, as well as in military matters. = Balkan Wars = Portrait by Philip de L√°szl√≥, 1906 As Imperial Foreign Minister, Count Berchtold focused almost exclusively on the Balkans where his foreign policy aims were to maintain peace, stick to the principle of non-intervention and preserve the territorial status quo. The Balkan Wars in 1912/1913, however, quickly made such a policy illusory. At the outset of the Balkan Wars, Count Berchtold pursued a hard-line policy and flirted with the idea of war against Serbia, but vacillated and pulled back from intervention at the last moment. Although he managed to prevent Serbia from securing an outlet to the Adriatic Sea by support given to the creation of Albania, the Balkan Wars resulted in a failure to contain the rising Russian influence in the Balkans and thwart Serbian ambitions for a united Yugoslav state. It meant diplomatic defeat for Austria-Hungary and also a reputation of being weak and indecisive for Count Berchtold. Count Berchtold's focus on Serbia was grown out of a fear of Serbian territorial expansion in the Balkans and also a complication of frictional matters within the multinational Dual Monarchy, and would eventually result in the dissolution of the empire itself. = July Crisis = Following the Balkan Wars, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 was therefore a culmination of the heightened tension between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. If Count Berchtold had been accused of indecisiveness and diffidence during the Balkan Wars, he gave proof of more resolve during the July Crisis. Pushed by the so-called Young Rebels at the Ballhausplatz led by Count Hoyos, his chef de cabinet, Count Berchtold seized the opportunity to launch punitive action against Serbia and deal the country a mortal blow. After having dispatched Count Hoyos on a mission to Berlin on 5 July to secure German support for Austria-Hungary's future actions, which resulted in the famous \\"blank cheque\\", he became the leading spokesman, together with the Chief of the General Staff General Conrad von H√∂tzendorf, for war against Serbia during the meeting of the Imperial Crown Council on 7 July. Through the moderating influence of the Hungarian Minister-President Count Tisza, who had reservations on the use of force against Serbia, it was decided to present Serbia with an ultimatum. The ten-point ultimatum was presented to Emperor Franz Joseph on 21 July and transmitted to Belgrade on 23 July. The previous night, according to his wife Nadine's testimony, Count Berchtold spent a sleepless night, altering the ultimatum and adding clauses, as he was very worried the Serbs could accept it. Serbian government accepted all points of the ultimatum but the one that permitted Austro-Hungarian authorities to participate in the investigation of the assassination on Serbian territory, which would have been a severe violation of Serbian sovereignty and the country's constitution. As the acceptance of all 10 demands listed in the ultimatum was required, the Austro-Hungarian government made a decision to enter a state of war with Serbia on 28 July, for which he was largely to blame. = World War I = Count Leopold von Berchtold Once war had started, Count Berchtold focused his efforts on the question of Italy‚Äôs participation, the outcome of which would lead to his downfall. The main problem was Italy‚Äôs demands for territorial compensation in exchange for remaining within the Triple Alliance. When Rome presented the Ballhausplatz with demands for control over territories in southern Austria-Hungary, Berchtold demurred and refused to offer any Habsburg concessions, especially not in the Trentino. However, Italian Foreign Minister Baron Sonnino succeeded in obtaining vague promises of compensations in South Tyrol from Germany and by the end of 1914, Count Berchtold informed the Crown Council that the choice was either acceptance of the Italian demands or a declaration of war. Both Count Tisza and General Conrad von H√∂tzendorf expressed a preference for the latter.Stephen Pope & Elizabeth-Anne Wheal, The Macmillan Dictionary of the First World War, London, Macmillan, 1995, p. 68. Under mounting German pressure, Count Berchtold, however, indicated that he was ready to cede the Trentino and parts of the Albanian coastline. When he informed Tisza and Conrad of the concessions he was ready to give, they forced him to resign on 13 January 1915. At Count Tisza‚Äôs insistence he was replaced by the more pugnacious Count Buri√°n. Berchtold played no further public role during the war, although he was appointed Lord High Steward to Archduke Karl, the heir apparent, in March 1916, and became Lord Chamberlain following the latter's accession to the throne in November. Count Berchtold had been invested as a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1912Chevaliers de la Toison d'Or and bestowed with the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stephen in 1914.Magyar Kir√°lyi Szent Istv√°n Rend After the war, he retired as a grand seigneur on his estate at Peresznye near Csepreg in Hungary, where he died on 21 November 1942. He was buried in the family tomb at Buchlau. = Assessment = Count Berchtold was described at the time as \\"intelligent and hard-working\\" and possessed of a \\"great personal charm\\" that made him well-liked at court. Indeed, he possessed all the social graces required at the Hofburg and impressed with his aristocratic background. However he lacked the strength of character and broad experience that would have been desirable in an imperial foreign minister. This contributed to quick reversals of decisions, giving rise to a foreign policy often perceived as inconsistent and vacillating. Many historians have regarded him as indecisive and diffident. However, during the July Crisis this appears not to have been the case as he \\"commanded and managed the process\\" on this occasion.Samuel R. Williamson, Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War, New York, Bedford, 1991, p. 191. His responsibility for the outbreak of the First World War has been much debated by historians. Without a doubt, he played a leading role in the intransigent formulation in the ultimatum of 23 July, the declaration of war on 28 July, and the rebuttal of Grey's mediation proposal on 29 July. He believed that only the defeat of Serbia could preserve the Dual Monarchy. Despite that, he was not thought of as a warmonger by, for example, General Conrad von H√∂tzendorf. At the same time, his lack of self-confidence at the helm of Austro-Hungarian diplomacy made him susceptible to persuasion by his pro-war staff at the Ballhausplatz, on whose advice and opinions he was heavily dependent. Although Berchtold may have personally pushed for war, the main question is whether he appreciated that a war against Serbia carried the risk of a major European war. According to G. A. Tunstall Jr, \\"a Russian intervention doesn't seem to had been taken into much consideration by the Austro-Hungarian leaders during the decision-making process\\". In any case, \\"if he did not apprehend the consequences of his policies sufficiently, he was, however, not alone; as a matter of fact, there were few diplomats at the time who actually did\\". = In film and television = Count Berchtold was portrayed by actor John Gielgud in the 1969 film Oh!

Signs and symptoms The various signs and symptoms in Sheehan's syndrome are caused by damage to the pituitary, thereby causing a decrease in one or more of the hormones it normally secretes. Because the pituitary controls many glands in the endocrine system, partial or complete loss of a variety of functions may result. The most common initial symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome are agalactorrhea (absence of lactation) and/or difficulties with lactation. Many women also report amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after delivery. In some cases, a woman with Sheehan syndrome is relatively asymptomatic; therefore, the diagnosis would not be made until years later, with features of hypopituitarism. Such features include secondary hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism due to pituitary dysfunction) with tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, as well as a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. Another such feature is secondary adrenal insufficiency (lack of ACTH secretion from the anterior pituitary). In a more chronic case, it is similar to Addison's disease with symptoms including fatigue, weight loss, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), anemia and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). Such a patient may become acutely exacerbated when her body is stressed by a severe infection or surgery years after her delivery: a condition equivalent with an Addisonian crisis. The symptoms of adrenal crisis should be treated immediately and can be life- threatening. Gonadotropin deficiency will often cause amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, hot flashes, or decreased libido. Cessation of menses is an important indicator of Gonadotropin deficiency as a result of Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome. Growth hormone deficiency causes many vague symptoms including fatigue and decreased muscle mass. Growth-hormone deficiency is the most common symptom of hypopituitarism seen in Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome with a 90‚Äì100% occurrence seen in the Netherlands, Costa Rica, and Saudi Arabia. In these populations the occurrence of Cortisol, TSH, and gonadotropin deficiencies ranges from 50 to 100%. Hematological changes may occur due to a decrease in erythropoietin synthesis as a result of these cortisol and thyroid hormone decreases. Uncommonly, Sheehan syndrome may also appear acutely after delivery, mainly by hyponatremia. Electrolytic imbalances might result from the increased secretion of ADH, which may be caused by a decrease in blood pressure due to lower glucocorticoid deficiency. There are several possible mechanisms by which hypopituitarism can result in hyponatremia, including decreased free-water clearance by hypothyroidism, direct syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) hypersecretion, decreased free-water clearance by glucocorticoid deficiency (independent of ADH). Serum potassium levels, however, will not change due to Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome. This is because potassium levels are primarily regulated independently from the pituitary gland (the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system begins in the kidney). Causes In the developed world Sheehan‚Äôs Syndrome is a rare complication of pregnancy, usually manifesting after excessive blood loss after delivery. The presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (i.e., in amniotic fluid embolism or HELLP syndrome) also appears to be a factor in its development. A retrospective study in Turkey found that the prevalence of Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome was directly proportional to the amount of at-home deliveries each decade. This may be due to previously limited obstetric techniques present in a home environment. For example, an area of improvement in preventing the condition could be the an increase in the efficacy of treatment to hypovolemic shock through blood transfusion. Pituitary necrosis may directly result from a lack of blood flow in the hypophyseal artery as a result of pituitary gland enlargement during pregnancy. One cause of pituitary growth associated with the risk of Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome is the hyperplasia of lactotrophs (responsible for prolactin production). Ischemia may occur as a result of vasospasm, thrombosis, or vascular compression sometimes as a result of an increase in the amount of lactotroph cells throughout gestation (contributing to the enlargement of the pituitary gland). Necrosis may occur as a result of severe hypotension or shock due to excessive uterine bleeding following childbirth. Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome may occur as a result of the arterial constriction and abnormal hypotension in conjunction with an insufficiency to meet the increased demand in blood supply of the pituitary gland seen during pregnancy. This increased blood-flow and metabolic demand is associated with the previously mentioned hyperplasia of lactotrophs. Some possible predisposing factors to Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome may include: inherited or acquired disseminated blood coagulation (DIC), restriction pituitary blood supply, small sella size, vasospasm, or thrombosis. Post-Partum Hemorrhaging (PPH) is believed to be a predictor of Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome, so the symptoms of anaemia, obesity, and advanced maternal age may increase the risk of Sheehan Syndrome. Atony of the uterus may be related to PPH that could induce Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome. This results in the abnormally prolonged flow of blood to the placenta after delivery. Pathophysiology Sheehan's syndrome is caused by damage to the pituitary, thereby causing a decrease in one or more of the hormones it normally secretes. The anterior pituitary is supplied by a low pressure portal venous system. A 1995 study found that 56.2% of patients with diagnosed Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome experienced a loss of all pituitary hormones (with the remaining 43.8% having selective pituitary insufficiency). Since the growth hormone-secreting cells are located at the periphery of the pituitary (and are therefore most likely to be affected by ischemia), all of the patients experienced growth hormone deficiency. Diagnosis Hormonal assays are conducted to determine a patient has low levels of T4, TSH, estrogen, gonadotropin, cortisol, and ACTH depending on the extent of necrosis. It might be difficult to detect damage to these hormone pathways if hormone levels are at the borderline of the abnormal range. In this case, stimulation tests will be done to determine if the pituitary is responsive to hypothalamic hormones. For example, to determine deficiencies in cortisol release, synthetic ACTH might be administered, and hormonal assays will be conducted to determine the strength of the response. Additionally, MRI of the pituitary and hypothalamus: this helps to exclude tumor or other pathologies. Treatment Lifelong hormone replacement therapy for the hormones that are missing. This may involve treatment with glucocorticoids. After hormone profiling, treatment with cortisol, ACTH, thyroid hormones, gonadotropins, and prolactin as seen in cases of hypopituitarism may occur. Epidemiology In a study of 1,034 symptomatic adults, Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome was found to be the sixth-most frequent etiology of growth hormone deficiency, being responsible for 3.1% of cases (versus 53.9% due to a pituitary tumor). Sheehan syndrome is more prevalent in developing countries than developed countries. Additionally, it was found that the majority of women who experienced Sheehan syndrome gave birth at home rather than in a hospital. History The specific association with postpartum shock or hemorrhage was described in 1937 by the British pathologist Harold Leeming Sheehan (1900‚Äì1988). The initial distinction was made in the research article ‚ÄúPost-Partum Necrosis of the Anterior Pituitary‚Äù. In his research, Dr. Sheehan reviewed (through autopsy) the effects of pituitary necrosis on 12 cases of patient‚Äôs that experienced postpartum necrosis. He observed cases where lesions and death occurred during or after pregnancy, as well as cases where death occurred in the late stage of necrosis (years later). This started the initial distinction of Sheehan‚Äôs syndrome from Simmonds‚Äô disease (also known as hypopituitarism). Dr. Sheehan noted that significant features of these patient cases was hemorrhaging, which in his experience was most commonly caused by either: placenta Previa (low placenta), uterine rupture, cervical or uterine tears, post-partum atony, or retained placenta. Simmonds' disease, however, occurs in either sex due to causes unrelated to pregnancy. However, in his 1939 publication: ‚ÄúSimmonds‚Äô Disease due to Post-partum Necrosis of the Anterior Pituitary‚Äù, Dr. Sheehan displays post-partum necrosis as a cause of Simmonds‚Äô disease, thus establishing the relationship between the two conditions. According to Sheehan in 1939 approximately 41% of survivors of severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and/or hypovolemic shock experienced severe or partial hypopituitarism.

It is not really a law (because counterexamples are easy to find) but a method of hand evaluation which describes a relationship that seems to exist somewhat regularly. Written by Jean-Ren√© Vernes for French players in the 1950s as a rule of thumb, it was first described in English in 1966 International Bridge Academy Annals. It received more notice from appearing in The Bridge World in June 1969. In 1981 Dick Payne and Joe Amsbury, using their abbreviation TNT (Total Number of Tricks), wrote at length about it for British readers. Later, in the US, Marty Bergen and Larry Cohen popularized the approach, using their preferred abbreviation: 'the LAW' (all capitals). It was prefigured in S. J. \\"Skid\\" Simon's 1945 book Why You Lose at Bridge in his aphorism \\"When in doubt, bid one more\\". Definition LoTT can be stated as follows: The total number of tricks available on a deal is equal to the total number of trump cards both sides hold in their respective best suits, where the total number of tricks is defined as the sum of the number of tricks available to each side if they could choose trumps. As an example, if North-South between them hold nine spades and East-West hold eight clubs, the LoTT says that the total number of tricks available is 17 (9 + 8). Note the LoTT says nothing about how many tricks each side will make; this depends on the split of high card points (HCP) as well as the number of trumps held - if, in the example, the side with eight clubs held all the HCP, they would make all 13 tricks with clubs as trumps - but if the other side could choose spades as trumps, they could well make four tricks (draw trumps and cross ruff) - note 13 + 4 still = 17. When the HCP are fairly evenly split between the two sides, the number of trumps held by each side is a close indicator of the tricks available to each side. This method works on the assumption that for shapely hands, the combined length of the trump suit is more significant than points or HCP in deciding on the level of the final contract. It is of most value in competitive bidding situations where the HCP are divided roughly equally between the partnerships. LoTT is said to be most accurate when the HCP are fairly evenly divided between the two sides and the bidding is competitive. Experts apply adjustment factors to improve accuracy. TNT (Total Number of Trumps = Total Number of Tricks) Payne and Amsbury's Bridge: TNT and Competitive Bidding (1981) may have been the first major book on the topic. In the introduction, the authors acknowledge Jean-Ren√© Vernes as the first writer to investigate TNT (Total Number of Tricks) Theory. Page 19 includes a key table that may not have been printed elsewhere. Total trumps principle By combining LoTT with the scoring table, it is argued that the following Total trumps principle is quite often a winning strategy: :Bid to a number of tricks equal to the number of trumps you and your partner hold (and no higher) in a competitive auction. Thus, if with an eight-card fit, a pair is safe to bid to the two level but are unsafe to go to the three level. But, with a nine-card fit, the three level will be safe. In this context, \\"safe\\" does not necessarily mean that the contract will be made. But if not, it means that it is a worthwhile sacrifice against the opponents' contract. For example, if the opponents have bid to two spades, and you have a nine-card heart fit, the \\"law\\" says you should bid three hearts. Assuming the opponents have an eight-card spade fit, there are 17 total tricks. If the opponents can take eight tricks, LoTT says you can take nine. If the opponents can take nine tricks, LoTT says you can take only eight. But down one (even doubled, if not vulnerable) is a smaller negative score for you than letting the opponents make three. Derived from LoTT, this principle assists players in judging the level to which they should bid in a competitive situation. At its simplest a player should bid to the level of their calculation (from the bidding) of the number of trumps held by their side: * When the balance of HCP is unfavourable, bidding to this level will act as a useful sacrifice * When the balance of HCP is favourable, bidding to this level will be an achievable contract * When the HCP are fairly equally split between the two sides, bidding to this level avoids the danger of a misplaced sacrifice In certain competitive situations, vulnerability can influence the optimum contract. Thus, with the HCP evenly split and facing a bid at the three level by the opposition, bidding to a level above the number of trumps held can be a useful sacrifice at favourable vulnerability. Examples For example, suppose that North-South have an eight-card heart fit and East-West have an eight-card spade fit. The total number of trumps is 16 so the \\"law\\" says the total number of tricks is also 16. That is, if North- South can take eight tricks playing in hearts, then East-West can take 16 - 8 = 8 tricks playing in spades; if North-South can take nine tricks in hearts, LoTT says East-West can take only seven tricks in spades. In the diagram, N-S have 9 spades and E-W 8 hearts combined. N-S can make 4 spades (conceding two clubs and heart ace) while E-W can make only 1 heart on a good defense (which takes a trump from QJ, two spades, diamond ace and two diamond ruffs)‚Äîthe law holds, as the total tricks available is 10+7=17. Note, however, how minor card rearrangements affect the law: {  #If the N-S diamonds were divided 4-2 instead of 5-1, with clubs consequently divided 3-3, the available total tricks would be only 8 for N-S + 8 for E-W = 16 #If, on the other hand, the E-W spades were divided 3-1 instead of 2-2 (with appropriate minor-suit rearrangement), they could make 2, while N-S could still make 4, giving 18 total tricks. } =Consequences= There are a number of bridge conventions that take advantage of this principle. For example, Bergen raises following an opening bid of one of a major (using a 5-card major system): * 3 of the major = 4-card support and 0-6 HCP * 3C = 4-card support and 7-9 points * 3D = 4-card support and 10-12 HCP In 2002, Anders Wirgren called the accuracy of the \\"law\\" into question, saying it works on only 35-40% of deals. However, Larry Cohen remains convinced it is a useful guideline, especially when adjustments are used properly.

The values outlined in the Social Contract provide the basic principles for the Debian Free Software Guidelines that serve as the basis of the Open Source Definition. Debian believes the makers of a free software operating system should provide guarantees when a user entrusts them with control of a computer. These guarantees include: *Ensuring that the operating system remains open and free. *Giving improvements back to the community that made the operating system possible. *Not hiding problems with the software or organization. *Staying focused on the users and the software that started the phenomenon. *Making it possible for the software to be used with non-free software. History The idea of the DSC was first proposed by Ean Schuessler after a conversation with Bob Young, co-founder of Red Hat. Schuessler said Red Hat should issue a set of guidelines that would guarantee to the community as the company expanded it would always be committed to the ideals of Free Software. Young said this would be a \\"kiss of death\\" for RedHat, implying it would constrain the company's ability to generate profit. Concerned about Young's response, Schuessler and other Debian developers decided to broach the idea of a \\"social contract\\" that would supplement Debian's initial manifesto written by Ian Murdock. Bruce Perens later led the effort from June 1997Debian's \\"Social Contract\\" with the Free Software Community email from Bruce Perens to debian-announce, July 4th 1997 to coordinate the creation of the DSC using the Free Software Definition as its basis. The Debian project ratified its social contract 1.0 on July 5, 1997.

Most photometers convert light into an electric current using a photoresistor, photodiode, or photomultiplier. Photometers measure: *Illuminance *Irradiance *Light absorption *Scattering of light *Reflection of light *Fluorescence *Phosphorescence *Luminescence History Before electronic light sensitive elements were developed, photometry was done by estimation by the eye. The relative luminous flux of a source was compared with a standard source. The photometer is placed such that the illuminance from the source being investigated is equal to the standard source, as the human eye can judge equal illuminance. The relative luminous fluxes can then be calculated as the illuminance decreases proportionally to the inverse square of distance. A standard example of such a photometer consists of a piece of paper with an oil spot on it that makes the paper slightly more transparent. When the spot is not visible from either side, the illuminance from the two sides is equal. By 1861, three types were in common use. These were Rumford's photometer, Ritchie's photometer, and photometers that used the extinction of shadows, which was considered to be the most precise. =Rumford's photometer= Rumford's photometer Rumford's photometer (also called a shadow photometer) depended on the principle that a brighter light would cast a deeper shadow. The two lights to be compared were used to cast a shadow onto paper. If the shadows were of the same depth, the difference in distance of the lights would indicate the difference in intensity (e.g. a light twice as far would be four times the intensity). =Ritchie's photometer= Ritchie's photometer Ritchie's photometer depends upon equal illumination of surfaces. It consists of a box (a,b) six or eight inches long, and one in width and depth. In the middle, a wedge of wood (f,e,g) was angled upwards and covered with white paper. The user's eye looked through a tube (d) at the top of a box. The height of the apparatus was also adjustable via the stand (c). The lights to compare were placed at the side of the box (m, n)‚Äîwhich illuminated the paper surfaces so that the eye saw both surfaces at once. By changing the position of the lights, they were made to illuminate both surfaces equally, with the difference in intensity corresponding to the square of the difference in distance. =Method of extinction of shadows= This type of photometer depended on the fact that if a light throws the shadow of an opaque object onto a white screen, there is a certain distance that, if a second light is brought there, obliterates all traces of the shadow. Principle of photometers Most photometers detect the light with photoresistors, photodiodes or photomultipliers. To analyze the light, the photometer may measure the light after it has passed through a filter or through a monochromator for determination at defined wavelengths or for analysis of the spectral distribution of the light. Photon counting Some photometers measure light by counting individual photons rather than incoming flux. The operating principles are the same but the results are given in units such as photons/cm2 or photons¬∑cm‚àí2¬∑sr‚àí1 rather than W/cm2 or W¬∑cm‚àí2¬∑sr‚àí1. Due to their individual photon counting nature, these instruments are limited to observations where the irradiance is low. The irradiance is limited by the time resolution of its associated detector readout electronics. With current technology this is in the megahertz range. The maximum irradiance is also limited by the throughput and gain parameters of the detector itself. The light sensing element in photon counting devices in NIR, visible and ultraviolet wavelengths is a photomultiplier to achieve sufficient sensitivity. In airborne and space-based remote sensing such photon counters are used at the upper reaches of the electromagnetic spectrum such as the X-ray to far ultraviolet. This is usually due to the lower radiant intensity of the objects being measured as well as the difficulty of measuring light at higher energies using its particle-like nature as compared to the wavelike nature of light at lower frequencies. Conversely, radiometers are typically used for remote sensing from the visible, infrared though radio frequency range. Photography Photometers are used to determine the correct exposure in photography. In modern cameras, the photometer is usually built in. As the illumination of different parts of the picture varies, advanced photometers measure the light intensity in different parts of the potential picture and use an algorithm to determine the most suitable exposure for the final picture, adapting the algorithm to the type of picture intended (see Metering mode). Historically, a photometer was separate from the camera and known as an exposure meter. The advanced photometers then could be used either to measure the light from the potential picture as a whole, to measure from elements of the picture to ascertain that the most important parts of the picture are optimally exposed, or to measure the incident light to the scene with an integrating adapter. Visible light reflectance photometry A reflectance photometer measures the reflectance of a surface as a function of wavelength. The surface is illuminated with white light, and the reflected light is measured after passing through a monochromator. This type of measurement has mainly practical applications, for instance in the paint industry to characterize the colour of a surface objectively. UV and visible light transmission photometry These are optical instruments for measurement of the absorption of light of a given wavelength (or a given range of wavelengths) of coloured substances in solution. From the light absorption, Beer's law makes it possible to calculate the concentration of the coloured substance in the solution. Due to its wide range of application and its reliability and robustness, the photometer has become one of the principal instruments in biochemistry and analytical chemistry. Absorption photometers for work in aqueous solution work in the ultraviolet and visible ranges, from wavelength around 240 nm up to 750 nm. The principle of spectrophotometers and filter photometers is that (as far as possible) monochromatic light is allowed to pass through a container (cell) with optically flat windows containing the solution. It then reaches a light detector, that measures the intensity of the light compared to the intensity after passing through an identical cell with the same solvent but without the coloured substance. From the ratio between the light intensities, knowing the capacity of the coloured substance to absorb light (the absorbency of the coloured substance, or the photon cross section area of the molecules of the coloured substance at a given wavelength), it is possible to calculate the concentration of the substance using Beer's law. Two types of photometers are used: spectrophotometer and filter photometer. In spectrophotometers a monochromator (with prism or with grating) is used to obtain monochromatic light of one defined wavelength. In filter photometers, optical filters are used to give the monochromatic light. Spectrophotometers can thus easily be set to measure the absorbance at different wavelengths, and they can also be used to scan the spectrum of the absorbing substance. They are in this way more flexible than filter photometers, also give a higher optical purity of the analyzing light, and therefore they are preferably used for research purposes. Filter photometers are cheaper, robuster and easier to use and therefore they are used for routine analysis. Photometers for microtiter plates are filter photometers. Infrared light transmission photometry Spectrophotometry in infrared light is mainly used to study structure of substances, as given groups give absorption at defined wavelengths. Measurement in aqueous solution is generally not possible, as water absorbs infrared light strongly in some wavelength ranges. Therefore, infrared spectroscopy is either performed in the gaseous phase (for volatile substances) or with the substances pressed into tablets together with salts that are transparent in the infrared range. Potassium bromide (KBr) is commonly used for this purpose. The substance being tested is thoroughly mixed with specially purified KBr and pressed into a transparent tablet, that is placed in the beam of light. The analysis of the wavelength dependence is generally not done using a monochromator as it is in UV-Vis, but with the use of an interferometer. The interference pattern can be analyzed using a Fourier transform algorithm. In this way, the whole wavelength range can be analyzed simultaneously, saving time, and an interferometer is also less expensive than a monochromator. The light absorbed in the infrared region does not correspond to electronic excitation of the substance studied, but rather to different kinds of vibrational excitation. The vibrational excitations are characteristic of different groups in a molecule, that can in this way be identified. The infrared spectrum typically has very narrow absorption lines, which makes them unsuited for quantitative analysis but gives very detailed information about the molecules. The frequencies of the different modes of vibration varies with isotope, and therefore different isotopes give different peaks. This makes it possible also to study the isotopic composition of a sample with infrared spectrophotometry. Atomic absorption photometry Atomic absorption photometers are photometers that measure the light from a very hot flame. The solution to be analyzed is injected into the flame at a constant, known rate. Metals in the solution are present in atomic form in the flame. The monochromatic light in this type of photometer is generated by a discharge lamp where the discharge takes place in a gas with the metal to be determined. The discharge then emits light with wavelengths corresponding to the spectral lines of the metal. A filter may be used to isolate one of the main spectral lines of the metal to be analyzed. The light is absorbed by the metal in the flame, and the absorption is used to determine the concentration of the metal in the original solution.

Merriam Webster Dictionary defines mind as \\"the element or complex of elements in an individual that feels, perceives, thinks, wills, and especially reasons\\" and mind over matter as able to; \\"a situation in which someone is able to control a physical condition, problem, etc., by using the mind\\". Origin The phrase \\"mind over matter\\" first appeared in 1863 in The Geological Evidence of the Antiquity of Man by Sir Charles Lyell (1797‚Äì1875) and was first used to refer to the increasing status and evolutionary growth of the minds of animals and man throughout Earth history. Another related saying, \\"the mind drives the mass,\\" was coined almost two millennia earlier in 19 B.C. by the poet Virgil in his work Aeneid, book 6, line 727. Parapsychology In the field of parapsychology, the phrase has been used to describe paranormal phenomena such as psychokinesis. Mao Zedong \\"Mind over matter\\" was also Mao Zedong's idea that rural peasants could be \\"proletarianized\\" so they could lead the revolution and China could move from feudalism to socialism through New Democracy. According to some, it departs from Leninism in that the revolutionaries are peasants, instead of the urban proletariat. But others assert that this is a lazy analysis because Mao never disputed the fact that the proletariat should lead, he simply adapted Marxism to the conditions of China. Controlling pain The phrase also relates to the ability to control the perception of pain that one may or may not be experiencing.

It is a term that is usually synonymous with chestnut and one of the most common coat colors in horses. Some regions and breed registries distinguish it from chestnut, defining sorrel as a light, coppery shade, and chestnut as a browner shade. However, in terms of equine coat color genetics there is no known difference between sorrel and chestnut. Solid reddish-brown color is a base color of horses, caused by the recessive e gene.Red Factor The term \\"sorrel\\" probably comes from the color of the flower spike of the sorrel herb. In practice, in England and the east coast of the United States, all of these shades are usually called chestnut. The term \\"sorrel\\" is more common in the western United States. The practical difference is most often not in color, but in usage: horses ridden in the Western tradition are more often referred to as sorrel and horses ridden in the English tradition are chestnut. The American Quarter Horse Association, which uses both terms, describes a sorrel as a type of copper-red chestnut, but allows that chestnut is also a correct term. Many organizations simply avoid the issue and choose one of the two terms to denote all reddish or brown colorations that are not bay. Sorrel or chestnut coloration can be distinguished from dun, which results from different genetics, by the dun's slightly washed-out yellowish color, with a darker mane and tail than the rest of its coat, a narrow, dark line down the middle of the back, and possibly areas of darker color on the shoulder and forelegs. The base shade of a sorrel is similar to that of a blood bay, but sorrel can always be distinguished from bay by the bay's black \\"points\\" ‚Äî a black mane, tail and lower legs. Light- colored sorrels, sometimes called \\"blond sorrels,\\" especially if they have flaxen manes and tails, may resemble a palomino. However, true palomino coloration is the result of a horse's being heterozygous for the cream dilution gene. Some definitions list sorrel as a self color, used to describe only horses whose mane, tail, and legs are the same color as the rest of the coat, with the exception of white markings. Other definitions are broader and include reddish-brown horses with flaxen manes and tails.

Sydenham Teast Edwards (1768 ‚Äì 8 February 1819) was a natural history illustrator. He illustrated plants, birds and importantly published an illustrated book on the breeds of dogs in Britain, Cynographia Britannica. Edwards was born in 1768 in Usk, Monmouthshire, the son of Lloyd Pittell Edwards, a schoolmaster and organist, and his wife, Mary Reese, who had been married on 26 September 1765 at Llantilio Crossenny Church and where Sydenham was christened in 1768. Mary Reese was a sister of the Rev. William Reece, the curate of Llantilio Crossenny who had married Ann Mackafee. Their son, Richard Reece was an eminent physician and wrote a number of works on medicine. Young Edwards had a precocious talent for draughtsmanship and when only 11 years old had copied plates from Flora Londinensis for his own enjoyment. A certain Mr. Denman visited Abergavenny in 1779 and saw some of Edwards' work. Denman, being a friend of William Curtis, the publisher of botanical works, and founder of the Curtis's Botanical Magazine, spoke to Curtis about the boy. Curtis proceeded to have Edwards trained in both botany and botanical illustration. Edwards produced plates at a prodigious rate: between 1787 and 1815 he produced over 1,700 watercolours for the Botanical Magazine alone. He illustrated Cynographia Britannica (1800) (an encyclopaedic compendium of dog breeds in Britain), New Botanic Garden (1805-7), New Flora Britannica (1812), and The Botanical Register (1815-19). Edwards established the latter under his own editorship in 1815 after a disagreement with John Sims, who succeeded Curtis as editor. He also provided drawings for encyclopaedias such as Pantologia and Rees's Cyclop√¶dia. He completed a number of parrot illustrations between 1810 and 1812 which were acquired by Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. Edwards was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1804. Edwards' work inspired the decoration of ceramics made by a number of major potters of the time, such as Spode. He was buried at Chelsea Old Church (All Saints), London. There is confusion over the spelling of his middle name. He was baptised Sydenham Edwards, but by the 1790s adopted the middle name 'Teak' on some signatures of his drawings. His death certificate has this as 'Teaste', whereas his tombstone, in Chelsea Old Church, it was 'Teast'. A memorial in the church reads, \\"As a faithful delineator of nature, few equalled, none excelled.\\" The tombstone was destroyed by bombing in World War II, but has been replaced.

It featured her \\"flashing\\" the seven Olympic medals she won from 1996 to 2004. Mark Spitz made a cameo appearance. In April 2008, she joined Fox Network's popular sports talk program, The Best Damn Sports Show Period as a correspondent, covering major sporting events. In 2008, Beard participated in an anti-fur campaign for the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). She was photographed semi-nude (again covering her breasts and not exposing her nipples) in front of an American flag. The flag in that photograph is hung incorrectly according to the United States Flag Code with the blue field (canton) to the upper right. Shortly after the PETA campaign was released, accusations of hypocrisy surfaced. Beard had told a fashion blogger the year before that her favorite shoes were leather sandals, and she had stated during an interview with SmartMoney magazine that she would never buy a low-quality leather jacket. Personal life Beard is a vegetarian. She reports a case of mild dyslexia, which caused trouble with grades in school. She is married to photographer Sacha Brown.

Body Dysmorphia After achieving an athletic scholarship to the University of Arizona, Beard began to struggle with body dysmorphia disorder. Stress from wearing a swimsuit in front of others as well as seeing the photo-shopping process of her ads caused Beard to desire having a body which matched that in her photos. Beard has said that \\"even if it had hurt my swimming, I wouldn't have stopped. I wanted to be a great swimmer, but more than that, I wanted to be pretty, skinny, and perfect.\\" Autobiography Beard released an autobiography on April 3, 2012, entitled In the Water They Can't See You Cry: A Memoir.

This curved path was shown by Galileo to be a parabola, but may also be a line in the special case when it is thrown directly upwards. The study of such motions is called ballistics, and such a trajectory is a ballistic trajectory. The only force of significance that acts on the object is gravity, which acts downward, thus imparting to the object a downward acceleration. Because of the object's inertia, no external horizontal force is needed to maintain the horizontal velocity component of the object. Taking other forces into account, such as friction from aerodynamic drag or internal propulsion such as in a rocket, requires additional analysis. A ballistic missile is a missile only guided during the relatively brief initial powered phase of flight, and whose subsequent course is governed by the laws of classical mechanics. Ballistics (gr. Œ≤Œ¨ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ ('ba'llein'), \\"to throw\\") is the science of mechanics that deals with the flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles, especially bullets, unguided bombs, rockets, or the like; the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance. Trajectories of a projectile with air drag and varying initial velocities The elementary equations of ballistics neglect nearly every factor except for initial velocity and an assumed constant gravitational acceleration. Practical solutions of a ballistics problem often require considerations of air resistance, cross winds, target motion, varying acceleration due to gravity, and in such problems as launching a rocket from one point on the Earth to another, the rotation of the Earth. Detailed mathematical solutions of practical problems typically do not have closed-form solutions, and therefore require numerical methods to address.  The initial velocity  Let the projectile be launched with an initial velocity \\\\mathbf{v} (0) \\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{v}_0 , which can be expressed as the sum of horizontal and vertical components as follows: : \\\\mathbf{v}_0 = v_{0x}\\\\mathbf{i} + v_{0y}\\\\mathbf{j} . The components v_{0x} and v_{0y} can be found if the initial launch angle, \\\\theta , is known: : v_{0x} = v_0\\\\cos\\\\theta , : v_{0y} = v_0\\\\sin\\\\theta  Kinematic quantities of projectile motion  In projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of each other; that is, neither motion affects the other. This is the principle of compound motion established by Galileo in 1638,Galileo Galilei, Two New Sciences, Leiden, 1638, p.249 and used by him to prove the parabolic form of projectile motion Nolte, David D., Galileo Unbound (Oxford University Press, 2018) pp. 39-63.. The horizontal and vertical components of a projectile's velocity are independent of each other. A ballistic trajectory is a parabola with homogeneous acceleration, such as in a space ship with constant acceleration in absence of other forces. On Earth the acceleration changes magnitude with altitude and direction with latitude/longitude. This causes an elliptic trajectory, which is very close to a parabola on a small scale. However, if an object was thrown and the Earth was suddenly replaced with a black hole of equal mass, it would become obvious that the ballistic trajectory is part of an elliptic orbit around that black hole, and not a parabola that extends to infinity. At higher speeds the trajectory can also be circular, parabolic or hyperbolic (unless distorted by other objects like the Moon or the Sun). In this article a homogeneous acceleration is assumed. = Acceleration = Since there is only acceleration in the vertical direction, the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant, being equal to \\\\mathbf{v}_0 \\\\cos\\\\theta . The vertical motion of the projectile is the motion of a particle during its free fall. Here the acceleration is constant, being equal to g. The components of the acceleration are: : a_x = 0 , : a_y = -g . = Velocity = The horizontal component of the velocity of the object remains unchanged throughout the motion. The vertical component of the velocity changes linearly, because the acceleration due to gravity is constant. The accelerations in the x and y directions can be integrated to solve for the components of velocity at any time t, as follows: : v_x = v_0 \\\\cos(\\\\theta) , : v_y = v_0 \\\\sin(\\\\theta) - gt . The magnitude of the velocity (under the Pythagorean theorem, also known as the triangle law): : v = \\\\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 } . = Displacement = Displacement and coordinates of parabolic throwing At any time t , the projectile's horizontal and vertical displacement are: : x = v_0 t \\\\cos(\\\\theta) , : y = v_0 t \\\\sin(\\\\theta) - \\\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 . The magnitude of the displacement is: : \\\\Delta r=\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 } . Consider the equations, : x = v_0 t \\\\cos(\\\\theta) , y = v_0 t\\\\sin(\\\\theta) - \\\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 . If t is eliminated between these two equations the following equation is obtained: : y = \\\\tan(\\\\theta) \\\\cdot x-\\\\frac{g}{2v^2_{0}\\\\cos^2 \\\\theta} \\\\cdot x^2 . Since g, Œ∏, and v0 are constants, the above equation is of the form : y=ax+bx^2 , in which a and b are constants. This is the equation of a parabola, so the path is parabolic. The axis of the parabola is vertical. If the projectile's position (x,y) and launch angle (Œ∏ or Œ±) are known, the initial velocity can be found solving for v0 in the aforementioned parabolic equation: : v_0 = \\\\sqrt{{x^2 g} \\\\over {x \\\\sin 2\\\\theta - 2y \\\\cos^2\\\\theta}} .  Time of flight or total time of the whole journey  The total time t for which the projectile remains in the air is called the time of flight. : y = v_0 t \\\\sin(\\\\theta) - \\\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 After the flight, the projectile returns to the horizontal axis (x-axis), so y=0 . : 0 = v_0 t \\\\sin(\\\\theta) - \\\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 : v_0 t \\\\sin(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 : v_0 \\\\sin(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{1}{2}gt : t = \\\\frac{2 v_0 \\\\sin(\\\\theta)}{g} Note that we have neglected air resistance on the projectile. If the starting point is at height y0 with respect to the point of impact, the time of flight is: : t = \\\\frac{d}{v \\\\cos\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{v \\\\sin \\\\theta + \\\\sqrt{(v \\\\sin \\\\theta)^2 + 2gy_0}}{g} As above, this expression can be reduced to : t = \\\\frac{v\\\\sin{\\\\theta} + \\\\sqrt{(v\\\\sin{\\\\theta})^{2}}}{g} = \\\\frac{v\\\\sin{\\\\theta} + v\\\\sin{\\\\theta}}{g} = \\\\frac{2v\\\\sin{\\\\theta}}{g} = \\\\frac{2v\\\\sin{(45)}}{g} = \\\\frac{2v\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{g} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}v}{g} if Œ∏ is 45¬∞ and y0 is 0.  Maximum height of projectile  Maximum height of projectile The greatest height that the object will reach is known as the peak of the object's motion. The increase in height will last until v_y=0 , that is, : 0=v_0 \\\\sin(\\\\theta) - gt_h . Time to reach the maximum height(h): : t_h = \\\\frac{v_0 \\\\sin(\\\\theta)}{g} . For the vertical displacement of the maximum height of projectile: : h = v_0 t_h \\\\sin(\\\\theta) - \\\\frac{1}{2} gt^2_h : h = \\\\frac{v_0^2 \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta)}{2g} : h_{\\\\mathrm{max}} = \\\\frac{v_0^2}{2g} .  Relation between horizontal range and maximum height  The relation between the range d on the horizontal plane and the maximum height h reached at \\\\frac{t_d}{2} is: : h = \\\\frac{d\\\\tan\\\\theta}{4} h = \\\\frac{v_0^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}{2g} : d = \\\\frac{v_0^2\\\\sin2\\\\theta}{g} : \\\\frac{h}{d} = \\\\frac{v_0^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}{2g} √ó \\\\frac{g}{v_0^2\\\\sin2\\\\theta} : \\\\frac{h}{d} = \\\\frac{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}{4\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\cos\\\\theta} h = \\\\frac{d\\\\tan\\\\theta}{4} .  Maximum distance of projectile  The maximum distance of projectile The range and the maximum height of the projectile does not depend upon its mass. Hence range and maximum height are equal for all bodies that are thrown with the same velocity and direction. The horizontal range d of the projectile is the horizontal distance it has traveled when it returns to its initial height (y=0). : 0 = v_0 t_d \\\\sin(\\\\theta) - \\\\frac{1}{2}gt_d^2 . Time to reach ground: : t_d = \\\\frac{2v_0 \\\\sin(\\\\theta)}{g} . From the horizontal displacement the maximum distance of projectile: : d = v_0 t_d \\\\cos(\\\\theta) , so : d = \\\\frac{v_0^2}{g}\\\\sin(2\\\\theta) . Note that d has its maximum value when : \\\\sin 2\\\\theta=1 , which necessarily corresponds to : 2\\\\theta=90^\\\\circ , or : \\\\theta=45^\\\\circ . Trajectories of projectiles launched at different elevation angles but the same speed of 10 m/s in a vacuum and uniform downward gravity field of 10 m/s2. Points are at 0.05 s intervals and length of their tails is linearly proportional to their speed. t = time from launch, T = time of flight, R = range and H = highest point of trajectory (indicated with arrows). The total horizontal distance (d) traveled. : d = \\\\frac{v \\\\cos \\\\theta}{g} \\\\left( v \\\\sin \\\\theta + \\\\sqrt{(v \\\\sin \\\\theta)^2 + 2gy_0} \\\\right) When the surface is flat (initial height of the object is zero), the distance traveled: : d = \\\\frac{v^2 \\\\sin(2 \\\\theta)}{g} Thus the maximum distance is obtained if Œ∏ is 45 degrees. This distance is: : d_{\\\\mathrm{max}} = \\\\frac{v^2}{g}  Application of the work energy theorem  According to the work-energy theorem the vertical component of velocity is: : v_y^2 = (v_0 \\\\sin \\\\theta)^2-2gy . These formulae ignore aerodynamic drag and also assume that the landing area is at uniform height 0.  Angle of reach  The \\"angle of reach\\" is the angle (Œ∏) at which a projectile must be launched in order to go a distance d, given the initial velocity v. : \\\\sin(2\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{gd}{v^2} There are two solutions: : \\\\theta = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\arcsin \\\\left( \\\\frac{gd}{v^2} \\\\right) and : \\\\theta = 90^\\\\circ -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\arcsin \\\\left( \\\\frac{gd}{v^2} \\\\right)  Angle \\\\theta required to hit coordinate (x,y)  Vacuum trajectory of a projectile for different launch angles. Launch speed is the same for all angles, 50 m/s if \\"g\\" is 10 m/s2. To hit a target at range x and altitude y when fired from (0,0) and with initial speed v the required angle(s) of launch Œ∏ are: : \\\\tan \\\\theta = {\\\\left(\\\\frac{v^2\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{v^4-g(gx^2+2yv^2)}}{gx}\\\\right)} The two roots of the equation correspond to the two possible launch angles, so long as they aren't imaginary, in which case the initial speed is not great enough to reach the point (x,y) selected. This formula allows one to find the angle of launch needed without the restriction of y=0 . One can also ask what launch angle allows the lowest possible launch velocity. This occurs when the two solutions above are equal, implying that the quantity under the square root sign is zero. This requires solving a quadratic equation for v^2 , and we find : v^2/g=y+\\\\sqrt{y^2+x^2}. This gives : \\\\theta=\\\\arctan\\\\left(y/x+\\\\sqrt{y^2/x^2+1}\\\\right). If we denote the angle whose tangent is by , then : \\\\tan\\\\theta=\\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\alpha+1}{\\\\cos\\\\alpha} : \\\\tan(\\\\pi/2-\\\\theta)=\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\alpha}{\\\\sin\\\\alpha+1} : \\\\cos^2(\\\\pi/2-\\\\theta)=\\\\frac 12(\\\\sin\\\\alpha+1) : 2\\\\cos^2(\\\\pi/2-\\\\theta)-1=\\\\cos(\\\\pi/2-\\\\alpha) This implies : \\\\theta = \\\\pi/2 - \\\\frac 12(\\\\pi/2-\\\\alpha). In other words, the launch should be at the angle halfway between the target and Zenith (vector opposite to Gravity)  Total Path Length of the Trajectory  The length of the parabolic arc traced by a projectile, given that the height of launch and landing is the same and that there is no air resistance, is given by the formula: \\\\frac{v^2 \\\\cos^2\\\\theta}{2g} \\\\left ( 2 \\\\sec\\\\theta \\\\tan\\\\theta - \\\\ln \\\\left  \\\\frac{1 - \\\\sin\\\\theta}{1 + \\\\sin\\\\theta} \\\\right \\\\right ) where v is the initial velocity, \\\\theta is the launch angle and g is the acceleration due to gravity as a positive value. The expression can be obtained by evaluating the arc length integral for the height-distance parabola between the bounds initial and final displacements (i.e. between 0 and the horizontal range of the projectile) such that: \\\\int_{0}^{Range} \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}y}{\\\\mathrm{d}x} \\\\right )^2}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x = \\\\int_{0}^{v^2 \\\\sin(2\\\\theta) / g} \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\left ( -\\\\frac{g}{v^2 \\\\cos^2\\\\theta}x + \\\\tan\\\\theta \\\\right )^2}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x.  Trajectory of a projectile with air resistance  thumb400pxTrajectories of a mass thrown at an angle of 70¬∞: without drag with Stokes drag with Newton drag Air resistance creates a force that (for symmetric projectiles) is always directed against the direction of motion in the surrounding medium and has a magnitude that depends on the absolute speed: \\\\mathbf{F_{air}} = -f(v)\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat v}. The speed-dependence of the friction force is linear (\\\\propto v) at very low speeds (Stokes drag) and quadratic (\\\\propto v^2) at larger speeds (Newton drag). The transition between these behaviours is determined by the Reynolds number, which depends on speed, object size and kinematic viscosity of the medium. For Reynolds numbers below about 1000, the dependence is linear, above it becomes quadratic. In air, which has a kinematic viscosity around 0.15\\\\,\\\\mathrm{cm^2/s}, this means that the drag force becomes quadratic in v when the product of speed and diameter is more than about 0.015\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m^2/s}, which is typically the case for projectiles. * Stokes drag: \\\\mathbf{F_{air}} = -k_{\\\\mathrm{Stokes}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\qquad (for Re \\\\lesssim 1000) * Newton drag: \\\\mathbf{F_{air}} = -k\\\\,\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\qquad (for Re \\\\gtrsim 1000) Free body diagram of a body on which only gravity and air resistance acts The free body diagram on the right is for a projectile that experiences air resistance and the effects of gravity. Here, air resistance is assumed to be in the direction opposite of the projectile's velocity: \\\\mathbf{F_{\\\\mathrm{air}}} = -f(v)\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat v} = Trajectory of a projectile with Stokes drag = Stokes drag, where \\\\mathbf{F_{air}} \\\\propto \\\\mathbf{v}, only applies at very low speed in air, and is thus not the typical case for projectiles. However, the linear dependence of F_\\\\mathrm{air} on v causes a very simple differential equation of motion :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\begin{pmatrix}v_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_y\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}-\\\\mu\\\\,v_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ -g-\\\\mu\\\\,v_y\\\\end{pmatrix} in which the two cartesian components become completely independent, and thus easier to solve. Here, v_0,v_x and v_y will be used to denote the initial velocity, the velocity along the direction of x and the velocity along the direction of y, respectively. The mass of the projectile will be denoted by m, and \\\\mu:=k/m. For the derivation only the case where 0^o \\\\le \\\\theta \\\\le 180^o is considered. Again, the projectile is fired from the origin (0,0). The relationships that represent the motion of the particle are derived by Newton's Second Law, both in the x and y directions. In the x direction \\\\Sigma F = -kv_x = ma_x and in the y direction \\\\Sigma F = -kv_y - mg = ma_y . This implies that: a_x = -\\\\mu v_x = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}v_x}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} (1), and a_y = -\\\\mu v_y - g = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}v_y}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} (2) Solving (1) is an elementary differential equation, thus the steps leading to a unique solution for vx and, subsequently, x will not be enumerated. Given the initial conditions v_x = v_{x0} (where vx0 is understood to be the x component of the initial velocity) and s_x=0 for t=0 : v_x = v_{x0} e^{-\\\\mu t} (1a) s_x = \\\\frac{v_{x0}}{\\\\mu}(1-e^{-\\\\mu t}) (1b) While (1) is solved much in the same way, (2) is of distinct interest because of its non-homogeneous nature. Hence, we will be extensively solving (2). Note that in this case the initial conditions are used v_y=v_{y0} and s_y=0 when t=0 . \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}v_y}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\\\mu v_y - g (2) \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}v_y}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} + \\\\mu v_y = - g (2a) This first order, linear, non-homogeneous differential equation may be solved a number of ways; however, in this instance, it will be quicker to approach the solution via an integrating factor e^{\\\\int \\\\mu \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}t} . e^{\\\\mu t}(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}v_y}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} + \\\\mu v_y) = e^{\\\\mu t}(-g) (2c) (e^{\\\\mu t}v_y)^\\\\prime = e^{\\\\mu t}(-g) (2d) \\\\int{(e^{\\\\mu t}v_y)^\\\\prime \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}t} = e^{\\\\mu t}v_y = \\\\int{ e^{\\\\mu t}(-g) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}t} (2e) e^{\\\\mu t}v_y = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu} e^{\\\\mu t}(-g) + C (2f) v_y = \\\\frac{-g}{\\\\mu} + Ce^{-\\\\mu t} (2g) And by integration we find: s_y = -\\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu}t - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}(v_{y0} + \\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu})e^{-\\\\mu t} + C (3) Solving for our initial conditions: v_y(t) = -\\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu} + (v_{y0} + \\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu})e^{-\\\\mu t} (2h) s_y(t) = -\\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu}t - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}(v_{y0} + \\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu})e^{-\\\\mu t} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}(v_{y0} + \\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu}) (3a) With a bit of algebra to simplify (3a): s_y(t) = -\\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu}t + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}(v_{y0} + \\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu})(1 - e^{-\\\\mu t}) (3b) The total time of the journey in the presence of air resistance (more specifically, when F_{air}=-kv) can be calculated by the same strategy as above, namely, we solve the equation s_y(t)=0. While in the case of zero air resistance this equation can be solved elementarily, here we shall need the Lambert W function. The equation s_y(t)= -\\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu}t + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}(v_{y0} + \\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu})(1 - e^{-\\\\mu t}) = 0 is of the form c_1t+c_2+c_3e^{c_4t}=0, and such an equation can be transformed into an equation solvable by the W function (see an example of such a transformation here). Some algebra shows that the total time of flight, in closed form, is given as t=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{g}v_{y0}+W\\\\left(-\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{g} v_{y0}\\\\right)e^{-\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{g} v_{y0}\\\\right)}\\\\right)\\\\right). = Trajectory of a projectile with Newton drag = Trajectories of a skydiver in air with Newton drag The most typical case of air resistance, for the case of Reynolds numbers above about 1000 is Newton drag with a drag force proportional to the speed squared, F_{\\\\mathrm{air}} = -k v^2. In air, which has a kinematic viscosity around 0.15\\\\,\\\\mathrm{cm^2/s}, this means that the product of speed and diameter must be more than about 0.015\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m^2/s}. Unfortunately, the equations of motion can not be easily solved analytically for this case. Therefore, a numerical solution will be examined. The following assumptions are made: * Constant gravitational acceleration * Air resistance is given by the following drag formula, ::\\\\mathbf{F_D} = -\\\\tfrac{1}{2} c \\\\rho A\\\\, v\\\\,\\\\mathbf{v} ::Where: ::*FD is the drag force ::*c is the drag coefficient ::*œÅ is the air density ::*A is the cross sectional area of the projectile ::*Œº = k/m = cœÅA/(2m)  Special cases  Even though the general case of a projectile with Newton drag cannot be solved analytically, some special cases can. *Near-horizontal motion: In case the motion is almost horizontal, v_x\\\\ggv_y, such as a flying bullet, the vertical velocity component has very little influence on the horizontal motion. In this case: ::\\\\dot{v}_x(t) = -\\\\mu\\\\,v_x^2(t) ::v_x(t) = \\\\frac{1}{1/v_{x,0}+\\\\mu\\\\,t} ::x(t) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}\\\\ln(1+\\\\mu\\\\,v_{x,0}\\\\cdot t) :The same pattern applies for motion with friction along a line in any direction, when gravity is negligible. It also applies when vertical motion is prevented, such as for a moving car with its engine off. *Vertical motion upward: ::\\\\dot{v}_y(t) = -g-\\\\mu\\\\,v_y^2(t) ::v_y(t) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu}}\\\\tan\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{g\\\\,\\\\mu}\\\\cdot(t_{\\\\mathrm{peak}}-t)\\\\right) ::y(t) = y_{\\\\mathrm{peak}} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{g\\\\,\\\\mu}\\\\cdot(t_{\\\\mathrm{peak}}-t)\\\\right)\\\\right) :A projectile can not rise longer than t_\\\\mathrm{rise}=\\\\frac{\\\\pi/2}{\\\\sqrt{g\\\\,\\\\mu}} vertically before it reaches the peak. *Vertical motion downward: ::\\\\dot{v}_y(t) = -g+\\\\mu\\\\,v_y^2(t) ::v_y(t) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{g}{\\\\mu}}\\\\tanh\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{g\\\\,\\\\mu}\\\\cdot(t_{\\\\mathrm{peak}}-t)\\\\right) ::y(t) = y_{\\\\mathrm{peak}} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{g\\\\,\\\\mu}\\\\cdot(t_{\\\\mathrm{peak}}-t)\\\\right)\\\\right) :The projectile reaches almost its terminal velocity v_\\\\infty=\\\\sqrt{g/\\\\mu} after a time constant of roughly t=1/\\\\sqrt{g\\\\mu}.  Integral expressions  The approach will be to formulate integral expressions that can be evaluated numerically. All variables will then be expressed in terms of a parameter Q. A projectile of mass m is launched from a point (x_0, y_0), with an initial velocity \\\\mathbf{v_0} in an initial direction that makes an angle \\\\Psi_0 with the horizontal. It experiences air resistance that is given by F_{air} = -k v^2 that acts tangentially to the path of travel at any point. Newton's second law of motion is \\\\mathbf{F} = m\\\\mathbf{a}. Applying this in the x-direction yields; Where, v = \\\\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}, v_x and v_y are the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity v respectively. Let \\\\mu = \\\\frac{k}{m}, \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} v_x}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\\\\mathrm{d} t^2}, and \\\\cos \\\\Psi = \\\\frac{v_x}{v}.

The following computer program in the form of a Python script demonstrates such a simulation, where the projectile is modelled as a baseball (parameters from Hyperphysics - Fluid Friction). The script uses the libraries numpy (for arrays), scipy (for numerical integration of the ordinary differential equation, and for root- finding by Newton's method) and matplotlib (for plotting). #!/usr/bin/env python3 from math import * import numpy as np from scipy.integrate import odeint from scipy.optimize import newton import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def projectile_motion(g, mu, xy0, vxy0, tt): # use a four-dimensional vector function vec = [x, y, vx, vy] def dif(vec, t): # time derivative of the whole vector vec v = sqrt(vec[2] ** 2 + vec[3] ** 2) return [vec[2], vec[3], -mu * v * vec[2], -g - mu * v * vec[3 # solve the differential equation numerically vec = odeint(dif, [xy0[0], xy0[1], vxy0[0], vxy0[1 , tt) return vec[:, 0], vec[:, 1], vec[:, 2], vec[:, 3] # return x, y, vx, vy # Parameters of projectile (modelled after a baseball) g = 9.81 # Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2) rho_air = 1.29 # Air density (kg/m^3) v0 = 44.7 # Initial velocity (m/s) alpha0 = radians(75) # Launch angle (deg.) m = 0.145 # Mass of projectile (kg) cD = 0.5 # Drag coefficient (spherical projectile) r = 0.0366 # Radius of projectile (m) mu = 0.5 * cD * (pi * r ** 2) * rho_air / m # Initial position and launch velocity x0, y0 = 0.0, 0.0 vx0, vy0 = v0 * cos(alpha0), v0 * sin(alpha0) T_peak = newton(lambda t: projectile_motion(g, mu, (x0, y0), (vx0, vy0), [0, t])[3][1], 3) y_peak = projectile_motion(g, mu, (x0, y0), (vx0, vy0), [0, T_peak])[1][1] T = newton(lambda t: projectile_motion(g, mu, (x0, y0), (vx0, vy0), [0, t])[1][1], T_peak + 3) t = np.linspace(0, T, 501) x, y, vx, vy = projectile_motion(g, mu, (x0, y0), (vx0, vy0), t) print(\\"Time of flight: {:.1f} s\\".format(T)) # returns 6.6 s print(\\"Horizontal range: {:.1f} m\\".format(x[-1])) # returns 43.7 m print(\\"Maximum height: {:.1f} m\\".format(y_peak)) # returns 53.4 m # Plot of trajectory fig, ax = plt.subplots() (line,) = ax.plot(x, y, \\"r-\\", label=\\"Numerical\\") ax.set_title(r\\"Projectile path\\") ax.set_aspect(\\"equal\\") ax.grid(b=True) ax.legend() ax.set_xlabel(\\"$x$ (m)\\") ax.set_ylabel(\\"$y$ (m)\\") plt.savefig(\\"01 Path.png\\") # Plot of velocity components fig, ax = plt.subplots() (line,) = ax.plot(t, vx, \\"b-\\", label=\\"$v_x$\\") ax.set_title(r\\"Horizontal velocity component\\") ax.grid(b=True) ax.legend() ax.set_xlabel(\\"$t$ (s)\\") ax.set_ylabel(\\"$v_x$ (m/s)\\") plt.savefig(\\"02 Horiz vel.png\\") fig, ax = plt.subplots() (line,) = ax.plot(t, vy, \\"b-\\", label=\\"$v_y$\\") ax.set_title(r\\"Vertical velocity component\\") ax.grid(b=True) ax.legend() ax.set_xlabel(\\"$t$ (s)\\") ax.set_ylabel(\\"$v_y$ (m/s)\\") plt.savefig(\\"03 Vert vel.png\\") File:01 Path.png File:02 Horiz vel.png File:03 Vert vel.png This approach also allows to add the effects of speed-dependent drag coefficient, altitude-dependent air density and position-dependent gravity field. Lofted trajectory Lofted trajectories of North Korean missiles Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 A special case of a ballistic trajectory for a rocket is a lofted trajectory, a trajectory with an apogee greater than the minimum-energy trajectory to the same range. In other words, the rocket travels higher and by doing so it uses more energy to get to the same landing point. This may be done for various reasons such as increasing distance to the horizon to give greater viewing/communication range or for changing the angle with which a missile will impact on landing. Lofted trajectories are sometimes used in both missile rocketry and in spaceflight.Ballistic Missile Defense, Glossary, v. 3.0, US Department of Defense, June 1997.  Projectile motion at very large distances  Projectile trajectory around a planet, compared to the motion in a uniform field When a projectile without air resistance travels a range that is significant compared to the earth's radius (above ‚âà100 km), the curvature of the earth and the non-uniform gravitational field have to be considered. This is for example the case with spacecraft or intercontinental projectiles. The trajectory then has to be generalized from a parabola to a Kepler-ellipse with one focus at the center of the earth. The projectile motion then follows Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The trajectories' parameters have to be adapted from the values of a uniform gravity field stated above. The earth radius is taken as R, and g as the standard surface gravity.

Oren was born in Tel Aviv during the Mandate era. At age 15, he began his journalistic career as a messenger boy for Yediot Aharonot, and was a correspondent for that newspaper from 1952 to 1955. From 1955 to 1958, he served in the Israel Defense Forces as a reporter for the IDF's weekly magazine Bamahane. From 1958 to 1963, he studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From 1964 to 1994, he worked again for Yediot Aharonot. He advanced to editorship of important sections in the newspaper, and was at one point its chief correspondent in New York City. He only began his career as a literary writer at a relatively advanced age. In 1994, he published his first book, Seduction (Keter Publishing). The book did not sell well at first, and was considered a commercial failure. Then Oren appeared on Dan Shilon's television show, the most popular Israeli talk show at the time. The appearance was a springboard for the book, which turned into one of Israel's most popular bestsellers ever. A 2002 movie adaptation was also successful. Oren's success at the tills, nearly unprecedented in Israeli publishing, led him to found a publishing house, \\"Keshet\\". Founded in 1996, the company advertises Oren's books as well as bestsellers by authors such as Shifra Horn, Irit Linoor, Shelly Yachimovich, and Koby Oz. Oren's books are known for their fast pace and gripping plots. Since his first success, Oren tries to present a picture of various phenomena in the national culture, such as the seeking of eastern mysticism in ashrams. His books have been translated into several languages, including English and French. Most of his books are in the detective fiction genre. In 2002 his first book presenting a historical episode was published, Latrun, employing his compelling, readable style. In 2004 he published another book in this category, Target: Tel Aviv, concerning the Egyptian Army's invasion of Israel in the War of Independence. Oren lives in Tel Aviv. He has been married to his wife Nitza since 1961. They have three children and grandchildren.

Harvard Law School Library, Nuremberg Trials Project. History DEST, founded on April 29, 1938, in Berlin, was administered by the VWHA for the purpose of procuring building materials and organizing slave labor and overseeing quarry operations. The Sachsenhausen (1936), Buchenwald (1937), Flossenb√ºrg (1938), Mauthausen (1938), Natzweiler-Struthof (1939), Gross Rosen (1940) and Neuengamme (1940) concentration camp sites were chosen because of their proximity to soil suitable for making bricks, or due to the close proximity of a brickworks factory or stone quarry. DEST was widely successful in the exploitation of slave labor, most of whom were Jews, in the quarries. Human labor was used cruelly, becoming one of the main tenets of war crime charges in the Nuremberg Trials. The director of the program, SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer Oswald Pohl, who was stationed in Berlin, was sentenced to death for war crimes in 1947 in Nuremberg, and executed in 1951. In 1943, DEST changed its focus from stone industry to armaments. From this time the organization played a key role, helping the SS to enter some key war industries. This was underlined by its industrial park at St. Georgen and Gusen that made the SS a key supplier of aircraft fuselages (Bf 109, Me 262), carbines and machine guns to companies like BFW, Messerschmitt and Steyr- Daimler-Puch. To run its business with the inmates of the Gusen and Mauthausen concentration camps, DEST operated its headquarters of Granitwerke Mauthausen between 1940 and 1945 in the town of Sankt Georgen an der Gusen which was its biggest and most important \\"Werkgruppe\\" (industry group).St. Georgen ‚Äì Gusen ‚Äì Mauthausen: Concentration Camp Mauthausen Reconsidered By Rudolf Language: English  See also  * Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe References  External links  * The St. Georgen/Gusen headquarters of Granitwerke Mauthausen Category:Defunct companies of Germany Category:Economy of Nazi Germany Category:The Holocaust in Austria Category:1938 establishments in Germany Category:Construction and civil engineering companies established in 1938 Category:Companies involved in the Holocaust Category:SS Main Economic and Administrative Office ","title":"German Earth and Stone Works"},{"id":"862729","text":"Westside Seattle, formerly The Westside Weekly, is a weekly newspaper that serves the areas of West Seattle, Ballard, White Center, Burien, Des Moines, and SeaTac in Washington state.

It is also known as N-phenylacetamide, acetanil, or acetanilid, and was formerly known by the trade name Antifebrin. Preparation and properties Acetanilide can be produced by reacting acetic anhydride with aniline: :C6H5NH2 \\\\+ (CH3CO)2O ‚Üí C6H5NHCOCH3 \\\\+ CH3COOH The preparation used to be a traditional experiment in introductory organic chemistry lab classes,See, e.g., ; : the latter preparation includes the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline. but it has now been widely replaced by the preparation of either paracetamol or aspirin, both of which teach the same practical techniques (especially recrystallization of the product) but which avoid the use of aniline, a suspected carcinogen. Acetanilide is slightly soluble in water, and stable under most conditions. Pure crystals are plate shaped and colorless to white. Applications Acetanilide is used as an inhibitor of hydrogen peroxide decomposition and is used to stabilize cellulose ester varnishes. It has also found uses in the intermediation in rubber accelerator synthesis, dyes and dye intermediate synthesis, and camphor synthesis. Acetanilide is used for the production of 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl chloride, a key intermediate for the manufacture of the sulfa drugs. It is also a precursor in the synthesis of penicillin and other pharmaceuticals. In the 19th century acetanilide was one of a large number of compounds used as experimental photographic developers. =Pharmaceutical use= Acetanilide was the first aniline derivative found to possess analgesic as well as antipyretic properties, and was quickly introduced into medical practice under the names of Antifebrin by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886.. But its (apparent) unacceptable toxic effects, the most alarming being cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia and ultimately liver and kidney damage,. prompted the search for supposedly less toxic aniline derivatives such as phenacetin.. After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was established in 1948 that acetanilide was mostly metabolized to paracetamol (acetaminophen) in the human body, and that it was this metabolite that was responsible for the analgesic and antipyretic properties... The observed methemoglobinemia after acetanilide administration was ascribed to the small proportion of acetanilide that is hydrolyzed to aniline in the body.The presence of aniline as an impurity in 19th century batches of acetanilide drugs cannot be ruled out. In this sense as well, paracetamol (acetaminophen) is safer than acetanilide, as (1) the corresponding impurity would be 4-aminophenol, which is less toxic than aniline; and (2) in vivo hydrolysis of the amide group in paracetamol appears to be negligible. Acetanilide is no longer used as a drug in its own right, although the success of its metabolite ‚Äì paracetamol (acetaminophen) ‚Äì is well known (although it is itself toxic in excessive amounts).

Approximately forty cultivars are currently grown. Its specific epithet oleracea means \\"vegetable/herbal\\" in Latin and is a form of (). There are likely thousands of names for the purslane plant in various languages from the many human cultures that ate this plant as a nutritious herb throughout human history on the planet. Distribution Purslane has an extensive distribution, assumed to be mostly anthropogenic, extending from North Africa and Southern Europe through the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent to Malesia and Australasia. The species status in the Americas is uncertain. In general, it is often considered an exotic weed, but there is evidence that the species was in Crawford Lake deposits (Ontario) in 1350‚Äì1539, suggesting that it reached North America in the pre-Columbian era. Scientists suggested that the plant was already eaten by native Americans, who spread its seeds. How it reached the Americas is currently unknown. Description Portulaca oleracea flower. Purslane has smooth, reddish, mostly prostrate stems and the leaves, which may be alternate or opposite, are clustered at stem joints and ends. The yellow flowers have five regular parts and are up to wide. Depending upon rainfall, the flowers appear at any time during the year.

Metabolism P. oleracea is one of very few plants able to utilize both CAM and C4 photosynthesis pathways, for a long time believed to be incompatible with each other despite biochemical similarities. P. oleracea will switch from C4 to CAM pathways during times of drought and there is transcription regulation and physiological evidence for C4-CAM hybrid photosynthesis during mild drought. History Purslane is widely used in East Mediterranean countries. Archaeobotanical finds are common at many prehistoric sites. In historic contexts, seeds have been retrieved from a protogeometric layer in Kastanas, as well as from the Samian Heraion dating to seventh century BC. In the fourth century BC, Theophrastus names purslane, (), as one of the several summer pot herbs that must be sown in April (Enquiry into Plants 7.1.2). As Portulaca it figures in the long list of comestibles enjoyed by the Milanese given by Bonvesin de la Riva in his \\"Marvels of Milan\\" (1288).Noted by John Dickie, Delizia! The Epic History of Italians and Their Food (New York, 2008), p. 37. In antiquity, its healing properties were thought so reliable that Pliny the Elder advised wearing the plant as an amulet to expel all evil (Natural History 20.210). Uses =Culinary= Greek salad with purslane Purslane may be eaten as a leaf vegetable. William Cobbett noted that it was \\"eaten by Frenchmen and pigs when they can get nothing else. Both use it in salad, that is to say, raw\\". It has a slightly sour and salty taste and is eaten throughout much of Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Mexico.Pests in Landscapes and Gardens: Common Purslane. Pest Notes University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources Publication 7461. October 2003 The stems, leaves and flower buds are all edible raw or cooked. Purslane may be used fresh as a salad, stir-fried, or cooked as spinach is, and because of its mucilaginous quality it also is suitable for soups and stews. The sour taste is due to oxalic and malic acid, the latter of which is produced through the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) pathway that is seen in many xerophytes (plants living in dry conditions), and is at its highest when the plant is harvested in the early morning.Harold McGee. On Food and Cooking. Scribner. 2004 edition. Aboriginal Australians use the seeds of purslane to make seedcakes. Greeks, who call it () or (), use the leaves and the stems with feta cheese, tomato, onion, garlic, oregano, and olive oil. They add it in salads, boil it, or add it to casseroled chicken. In Turkey, besides being used in salads and in baked pastries, it is cooked as a vegetable similar to spinach, or is mixed with yogurt to form a tzatziki variant. In Egypt, it is also cooked like spinach as a vegetable dish, but not in salads. =Companion plant= As a companion plant, purslane provides ground cover to create a humid microclimate for nearby plants, stabilising ground moisture. Its deep roots bring up moisture and nutrients that those plants can use, and some, including corn, will follow purslane roots down through harder soil that they cannot penetrate on their own. Nutrition P. sativa, a subspecies Raw purslane is 93% water, 3% carbohydrates, and 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, purslane supplies 20 calories, and rich amounts (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin E (81% DV) and vitamin C (25% DV), with moderate content (11-19% DV) of several dietary minerals (table). Purslane has been identified as the richest vegetable source of alpha-linolenic acid, an essential omega-3 fatty acid. In popular culture Verdolaga, the Spanish word for purslane, is a nickname for South American football clubs with green-white schemes in their uniforms, including Colombia's Atletico Nacional and Argentina's Ferrocarril Oeste.

Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), was a case in the Supreme Court of the United States involving Congress's enforcement powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.. Background The plaintiffs were disabled Tennesseans who could not access the upper floors in state courthouses. They sued in Federal Court, arguing that since Tennessee was denying them public services because of their disabilities, it was violating Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Under Title II, no one can be denied access to public services due to his or her disability; it allows those whose rights have been violated to sue states for money damages. Tennessee argued that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited the suit, and filed a motion to dismiss the case. It relied principally on Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett (2001), in which the Supreme Court held that Congress had, in enacting certain provisions of the ADA, unconstitutionally abrogated the sovereign immunity of the States by letting people sue the States for discrimination on the basis of disability. That case, in turn, relied on the rule laid down by City of Boerne v. Flores: Congress may abrogate the Eleventh Amendment using its section 5 powers only if the way it seeks to remedy discrimination is \\"congruent and proportional\\" to the discrimination itself. Garrett had held that Congress had not met the congruent-and-proportional test--i.e., that it had not amassed enough evidence of discrimination on the basis of disability to justify the abrogation of sovereign immunity. Opinion of the Court In Lane, the Supreme Court split 5-4. In an opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the majority ruled that Congress did have enough evidence that the disabled were being denied those fundamental rights that are protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, among those rights being the right to access a court. Further, the remedy Congress enacted was congruent and proportional, because the \\"reasonable accommodations\\" mandated by the ADA were not unduly burdensome and disproportionate to the harm. Garrett, the Court said, applied only to Equal Protection claims, not to Due Process claims. Therefore, the law was constitutional. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas, and Antonin Scalia filed dissents.

Their music is inspired by the Pythagorean philosophy which states that \\"music is the harmonization of opposites; the conciliation of warring elements\\". The E.S. is an acronym for \\"Experimental Sounds\\" while Posthumus (Latin: posthumus, meaning \\"after death\\"; pronounced the same as Latin postumus (no 'h'), meaning \\"last\\") is a word that is meant to represent \\"all things past\\", suggesting the music was inspired by things that have ended, some time after they ended.eMediaWire - E.S. Posthumus Unearthed press release 5 May 2005. The words posterus and post(h)umus refer to things that follow after, cf. post(h)umus and posterus. Career The group was formed in 2000 by brothers Helmut and Franz Vonlichten. Helmut and Franz studied piano with their mother. After graduating from high school, Franz worked in recording studios while Helmut attended and graduated from UCLA, with a degree in archaeology. Their music has been licensed by many movie and television production studios, being included in numerous movie trailers and television shows. E.S. Posthumus released three albums overall in their career. On July 22, 2010, it was officially announced that Franz had died about two months before. After giving notice of his brother's death, Helmut stated that while there still may be one or two unreleased songs (one of them being their single \\"Christmas Eve\\" released in November 2010), the group would no longer be active. In November 2011, it was officially announced that Helmut Vonlichten had formed a new band called Les Friction, and released a preview of his new work with a track called \\"Torture\\". Albums =Unearthed= Unearthed was the first album composed by E.S. Posthumus. It was originally made available for purchase online through CD Baby in January 2001; It became the third-biggest selling album in CDBaby's history. The success of the album prompted the wide re-release to retail in May 2005 through Wigshop and 33rd Street Records/Bayside Distribution. A key piece to the distinctive sound of the music comes from working with the Northwest Sinfonia. Other musicians performing on this CD include Pedro Eustache, Michael Landau, Matt Laug, Lance Morrison, Davy Spillane and Efrain Toro. Many tracks from Unearthed have been featured in various movie trailers and television shows. They have been used in the trailers for movies due to their escalating structure, which makes them well- suited for the dramatic montages building towards the credits in the aforementioned trailers. =Cartographer= Cartographer, the second album from E.S. Posthumus, was supposed to be released sometime in 2006 but was actually released in early 2007. It is rumored the delay was due to the addition of Sans to the group of musicians, an addition much heralded by Helmut VonlichtenSoundtrackNet - \\"Unearthing Pythagoras\\" Franz Vonlichten interview 26 May 2005 =Makara= Makara is the third album of E.S.

According to Helmut, the project would be a re-arrangement of their favorite holiday songs and \\"bring something new to the party\\". This track was the only song they started recording before Franz died in May 2010. In a Facebook posting on the group's fanpage, mid-November 2010, Helmut relayed that ‚ÄúWhen Franz passed away last May, the project was barely off the ground; however, a lyric, piano sketch and rough vocal were completed on the new song.‚Äù In that same posting, Helmut shared that he contacted Jeremy Lubbock, the brothers' childhood favorite arranger, to arrange the song for them. Helmut later salvaged the rough vocal recorded months earlier and included it in the final recording. \\"Christmas Eve\\" is last song produced from the group E.S.

A lawyer by background, he successfully advocated the secession of Florida from the Union, becoming governor in October 1861. In that post, he turned the state into a major supplier of food for the Confederacy. In his final message to the state legislature as the war was ending, he had declared that death would be preferable to reunion with the North, and was found dead of gunshot soon after. Although this was assumed to be suicide, recent research has supported the theory that it was a hunting accident. Early life and personal life Milton was the \\"son of a prominent Southern family and a relative of the famed English poet of the same name. A capable lawyer and wily politician, he guided Florida through much of the maelstrom of the War Between the States with unique concern for the citizens of all means who populated his state.\\" He was the son of Homer Virgil Milton (1781‚Äì1822), an officer who fought in the War of 1812, and the grandson of Revolutionary War hero and former Georgia Secretary of State, John Milton (1756‚Äì1804). Born near Louisville, Georgia, he married Susan Cobb (‚Ä† 1842) in about 1830, and they had three children. John and Susan Milton lived in Georgia and later in Alabama. John got remarried to a Caroline Howze (1826-1901) from Alabama in 1844; they had two sons and seven daughters.Gene M. Burnett: Florida's Past (Band 1: People and Events That Shaped the State), 1986, page 197 John and Caroline lived in New Orleans (Alabama) and eventually settled in Marianna (northern Florida). One of his sons was Old West lawman Jeff Milton. One of John's grandsons, William Hall Milton (1864‚Äì1942), served as a United States Senator from Florida (1908‚Äì1909). Career During his career, John became a lawyer, practicing in a number of communities in Georgia and Alabama, before settling in New Orleans. He came to Florida in 1846, and quickly entered the Florida political scene. In 1848, he served as a presidential elector for the state, then in 1850 was elected to the Florida House of Representatives. American Civil War As a strong supporter of states' rights, he was an early advocate for secession of Florida from the Union. He was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention from Florida and in the same year ran for the office of governor. A convention was called for to take up the issue of secession and on January 10, 1861, the measure passed. He took the oath of office on October 7, 1861. During the Civil War, Milton stressed the importance of Florida as a supplier of goods, rather than men, with Florida being a large provider of food and salt for the Confederate Army. As the war drew to a close and the Confederacy was close to defeat, he became worn down by the stress of his office. Governor Milton left Tallahassee for his plantation, Sylvania, in Marianna, Florida. Death In his final message to the state legislature, he said that the Northern Army leaders \\"have developed a character so odious that death would be preferable to reunion with them.\\" On April 1, 1865, he was found by his son, William Henry Milton. His death from a fatal gunshot wound to the head was reported as an accident by his family, church, and the West Florida News. The New York Times assumed Governor Milton‚Äôs death to be suicide at the prospect of Union victory and Republican government. The president of the Florida Senate, Abraham K. Allison, was sworn in as governor of Florida later that day. Asserting that the governor has recently stated to the legislature that he did not want to live under the prospective oppression of a lost cause, the New York Times writer drew his own conclusions. The article is polemic in tone. Milton was found by his son at the Milton plantation, Sylvania, in Jackson County, Florida. He had suffered a fatal wound to his head. The West Florida News reported the sudden death of Florida‚Äôs fifth governor as a hunting accident. Governor John Milton was buried in the Episcopal cemetery at Marianna, Florida, near his home, Sylvania. Several recent works have investigated the event and discovered that the death was probably from an accident as Milton prepared for hunting. He is buried at Saint Luke's Episcopal Cemetery in Marianna. Like so many families of the era, Reconstruction was an economically difficult time for the late governor‚Äôs family in Jackson County, Florida. Milton‚Äô youngest son, Jefferson Davis Milton (1861‚Äì1947) moved to Texas, later Arizona. He distinguished himself as a Texas Ranger, police chief of El Paso, and served for over twenty-five years as America‚Äôs first border agent. William Hall Milton (1864‚Äì1942), grandson of the governor, was a U.S. Senator from Florida from 1908‚Äì1909.

He also served as the last French Secretary of State for War and first Minister of War during the beginning of the French Revolution. Duportail was born near Orl√©ans, France, in 1743. He graduated from the royal engineer school in M√©zi√®res, France, as a qualified engineer officer in 1765. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Royal Corps of Engineers, Duportail was secretly sent to America in March 1777 to serve in Washington's Continental Army under an agreement between Benjamin Franklin and the government of King Louis XVI of France. He was appointed colonel and commander of all engineers in the Continental Army, July 1777; brigadier general, November 17, 1777; commander, Corps of Engineers, May 1779; and major general (Brevet), November 16, 1781. Duportail participated in fortifications planning from Boston, Massachusetts to Charleston, South Carolina, where he was captured following the surrender of the city in May 1780, and helped Washington evolve the primarily defensive military strategy that wore down the British Army. Subsequently exchanged, he also directed the construction of siege works at the Battle of Yorktown, site of the decisive Franco-American victory of the Revolutionary War. During the encampment at Valley Forge in late-1777 and early-1778, his headquarters was at Cressbrook Farm.

In 1934, Ardex produced its first cyclecar, which followed the form of the Morgan three-wheeler and was powered by a V2 500 cc engine. A four-wheel car followed in 1937 which was at the time the cheapest car on the French market, priced at 5,500 francs: 10,900 francs were needed to buy a Simca 5.Curiously, the little Ardex factory and the much larger Simca plant were both located in Nanterre. In September 1939 France declared war on Germany and in June 1940 the German Army rapidly invaded and occupied Northern France. The war years were characterised by a desperate shortage of raw materials for civilian industry and of petrol. Their experience of producing very small lightweight cyclecars now encouraged Ardex to develop several little cars powered initially by electric batteries and later by pedal power during 1942 and 1943. The first significant order came from the Fulmen Company, then a leading French producer of electrical goods and equipment. The early wartime cyclecars came on four wheels, but the number of the wheels was quickly reduced to three since during 1942 tyres became increasingly hard to find and, where found, hard to afford. In October 1942 the occupying power banned the construction of electric cars, following which Ardex were restricted to pedal powered cyclecars until after the war. In 1953, Ardex introduced a four-seater microcar. The engine was a Soci√©t√© Anonyme BriBan (S.A.B.B) single cylinder two stroke unit of 100 or 125 cc.George Nick Georgano (Chief editor): The Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile. Volume 1: A‚ÄìF. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, Chicago 2001, . Production ended in 1955. The Ardex name was then acquired by Max Sardou, a French engineer. He went on to create the Ardex S80, which was entered in the 1981 24 Hours of Le Mans as a Group 6 Prototype but failed to qualify. It was powered by the BMW M88 3.5L from the BMW M1 and paired to a Hewland five speed manual transmission.

Most commercial broilers reach slaughter weight between four and seven weeks of age, although slower growing breeds reach slaughter weight at approximately 14 weeks of age. Typical broilers have white feathers and yellowish skin. Broiler or sometimes broiler-fryer is also used sometimes to refer specifically to younger chickens under 4.5 pounds, as compared with the larger roasters. Due to extensive breeding selection for rapid early growth and the husbandry used to sustain this, broilers are susceptible to several welfare concerns, particularly skeletal malformation and dysfunction, skin and eye lesions and congestive heart conditions. Management of ventilation, housing, stocking density and in-house procedures must be evaluated regularly to support good welfare of the flock. The breeding stock (broiler-breeders) do grow to maturity but also have their own welfare concerns related to the frustration of a high feeding motivation and beak trimming. Broilers are usually grown as mixed-sex flocks in large sheds under intensive conditions.  Modern breeding  Video of chickens almost ready to be slaughtered in a modern broiler farm Before the development of modern commercial meat breeds, broilers were mostly young male chickens culled from farm flocks. Pedigree breeding began around 1916. Magazines for the poultry industry existed at this time. A crossbred variety of chicken was produced from a male of a naturally double-breasted Cornish strain, and a female of a tall, large-boned strain of white Plymouth Rocks. This first attempt at a meat crossbreed was introduced in the 1930s and became dominant in the 1960s. The original crossbreed was plagued by problems of low fertility, slow growth and disease susceptibility. Modern broilers have become very different from the Cornish/Rock crossbreed. As an example, Donald Shaver (originally a breeder of egg-production breeds) began gathering breeding stock for a broiler program in 1950. Besides the breeds normally favoured, Cornish Game, Plymouth Rock, New Hampshire, Langshans, Jersey Black Giant and Brahmas were included. A white feathered female line was purchased from Cobb. A full-scale breeding program was commenced in 1958, with commercial shipments in Canada and the US in 1959 and in Europe in 1963. As a second example, colour sexing broilers was proposed by Shaver in 1973. The genetics were based on the company's breeding plan for egg layers, which had been developed in the mid-1960s. A difficulty facing the breeders of the colour-sexed broiler is that the chicken must be white-feathered by slaughter age. After 12 years, accurate colour sexing without compromising economic traits was achieved. = Artificial insemination = Artificial insemination is a mechanism in which spermatozoa are deposited into the reproductive tract of a female. Artificial insemination provides a number of benefits relating to reproduction in the poultry industry. Broiler breeds have been selected specifically for growth, causing them to develop large pectoral muscles, which interfere with and reduce natural mating. The amount of sperm produced and deposited in the hen's reproductive tract may be limited because of this. Additionally, the males' overall sex drive may be significantly reduced due to growth selection. Artificial insemination has allowed many farmers to incorporate selected genes into their stock, increasing their genetic quality. Abdominal massage is the most common method used for semen collection. During this process, the rooster is restrained and the back region located towards the tail and behind the wings is caressed. This is done gently but quickly. Within a short period of time, the male should get an erection of the phallus. Once this occurs, the cloaca is squeezed and semen is collected from the external papilla of the vas deferens. During artificial insemination, semen is most frequently deposited intra- vaginally by means of a plastic syringe. In order for semen to be deposited here, the vaginal orifice is everted through the cloaca. This is simply done by applying pressure to the abdomen of the hen. The semen-containing instrument is placed 2‚Äì4 cm into the vaginal orifice. As the semen is being deposited, the pressure applied to the hen's abdomen is being released simultaneously. The person performing this procedure typically uses one hand to move and direct the tail feathers, while using the other hand to insert the instrument and semen into the vagina.  General biology  Modern commercial broilers, for example, Cornish crosses and Cornish-Rocks, are artificially selected and bred for large-scale, efficient meat production. They are noted for having very fast growth rates, a high feed conversion ratio, and low levels of activity. Modern commercial broilers are bred to reach a slaughter- weight of about 2 kg in only 5 to 7 weeks.Damerow, G. 1995. A Guide to Raising Chickens. Storey Books. As a consequence, the behaviour and physiology of broilers reared for meat are those of immature birds, rather than adults. Slow growing free-range and organic strains have been developed which reach slaughter-weight at 12 to 16 weeks of age. Typical broilers have white feathers and yellowish skin. Recent genetic analysis has revealed that the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).Eriksson, J., Larson G., Gunnarsson, U., Bed'hom, B., Tixier-Boichard, M., et al. (2008) Identification of the Yellow Skin Gene Reveals a Hybrid Origin of the Domestic Chicken. PLoS Genet January 23, 2008 Genetics.plosjournals.org Modern crosses are also favorable for meat production because they lack the typical \\"hair\\" which many breeds have that must be removed by singeing after plucking the carcass. Both male and female broilers are reared for their meat. = Behaviour = Broiler behaviour is modified by the environment, and alters as the broilers‚Äô age and bodyweight rapidly increase. For example, the activity of broilers reared outdoors is initially greater than broilers reared indoors, but from six weeks of age, decreases to comparable levels in all groups. The same study shows that in the outdoors group, surprisingly little use is made of the extra space and facilities such as perches ‚Äì it was proposed that the main reason for this was leg weakness as 80 per cent of the birds had a detectable gait abnormality at seven weeks of age. There is no evidence of reduced motivation to extend the behavioural repertoire, as, for example, ground pecking remained at significantly higher levels in the outdoor groups because this behaviour could also be performed from a lying posture rather than standing. Examining the frequency of all sexual behaviour shows a large decrease with age, suggestive of a decline in libido. The decline in libido is not enough to account for reduced fertility in heavy cocks at 58 weeks and is probably a consequence of the large bulk or the conformation of the males at this age interfering in some way with the transfer of semen during copulations which otherwise look normal. = Feeding and feed conversion = Chickens are omnivores and modern broilers are given access to a special diet of high protein feed, usually delivered via an automated feeding system. This is combined with artificial lighting conditions to stimulate eating and growth and thus the desired body weight. In the U.S., the average feed conversion ratio (FCR) of a broiler was 1.91 pounds of feed per pound of liveweight in 2011, up from 4.70 in 1925. Canada has a typical FCR of 1.72. New Zealand commercial broiler farms have recorded the world's best broiler chicken FCR, consistently at 1.38 or lower.  Welfare issues  = Meat birds = One-day old chicks arriving to be unpacked and placed in shed. Young birds being reared in a closed broiler house. Artificial selection has led to a great increase in the speed with which broilers develop and reach slaughter-weight. The time required to reach 1.5 kg live-weight decreased from 120 days to 30 days between 1925 and 2005. Selection for fast early growth-rate, and feeding and management procedures to support such growth, have led to various welfare problems in modern broiler strains. Welfare of broilers is of particular concern given the large number of individuals that are produced; for example, the U.S. in 2011 produced approximately 9 billion broiler chickens.  Cardiovascular dysfunction  Selection and husbandry for very fast growth means there is a genetically induced mismatch between the energy-supplying organs of the broiler and its energy-consuming organs. Rapid growth can lead to metabolic disorders such as sudden death syndrome (SDS) and ascites. SDS is an acute heart failure disease that affects mainly male fast-growing broilers which appear to be in good condition. Affected birds suddenly start to flap their wings, lose their balance, sometimes cry out and then fall on their backs or sides and die, usually all within a minute. In 1993, U.K. broiler producers reported an incidence of 0.8%. In 2000, SDS has a death rate of 0.1% to 3% in Europe. Ascites is characterised by hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart, changes in liver function, pulmonary insufficiency, hypoxaemia and accumulation of large amounts of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Ascites develops gradually and the birds suffer for an extended period before they die. In the UK, up to 19 million broilers die in their sheds from heart failure each year.  Skeletal dysfunction  Breeding for increased breast muscle means that the broilers‚Äô centre of gravity has moved forward and their breasts are broader compared with their ancestors, which affects the way they walk and puts additional stresses on their hips and legs. There is a high frequency of skeletal problems in broilers, mainly in the locomotory system, including varus and valgus deformities, osteodystrophy, dyschondroplasia and femoral head necrosis. These leg abnormalities impair the locomotor abilities of the birds, and lame birds spend more time lying and sleeping. The behavioural activities of broilers decrease rapidly from 14 days of age onwards. Reduced locomotion also decreases ossification of the bones and results in skeletal abnormalities; these are reduced when broilers have been exercised under experimental conditions. Most broilers find walking painful, as indicated by studies using analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. In one experiment, healthy birds took 11 seconds to negotiate an obstacle course, whereas lame birds took 34 seconds. After the birds had been treated with carprofen, there was no effect on the speed of the healthy birds, however, the lame birds now took only 18 seconds to negotiate the course, indicating that the pain of lameness is relieved by the drug. In self-selection experiments, lame birds select more drugged feed than non-lame birds leading to the suggestion that leg problems in broilers are painful. Several research groups have developed \\"gait scores\\" (GS) to objectively rank the walking ability and lameness of broilers. In one example of these scales, GS=0 indicates normal walking ability, GS=3 indicates an obvious gait abnormality which affects the bird's ability to move about and GS=5 indicates a bird that cannot walk at all. GS=5 birds tried to use their wings to help them walking, or crawled along on their shanks. In one study, almost 26% of the birds examined were rated as GS=3 or above and can therefore be considered to have suffered from painful lameness. The video recordings below are examples of broilers attempting to walk with increasing levels of gait abnormalities and therefore increasing gait scores.

This increased inactivity is linked with an increase in dermatitis caused by a greater amount of time in contact with ammonia in the litter. This contact dermatitis is characterised by hyperkeratosis and necrosis of the epidermis at the affected sites; it can take forms such as hock burns, breast blisters and foot pad lesions.  Stocking density  Broilers in a rearing shed indicating the high stocking densities used. Broilers are usually kept at high stocking densities which vary considerably between countries. Typical stocking densities in Europe range between about 22 to 42 kg/m2 or between about 11 to 25 birds per square metre. There is a reduction of feed intake and reduced growth rate when stocking density exceeds approximately 30 kg/m2 under deep litter conditions. The reduced growth rate is likely due to a reduced capacity to lose heat generated by metabolism. Higher stocking densities are associated with increased dermatitis including foot pad lesions, breast blisters and soiled plumage. In a large-scale experiment with commercial farms, it was shown that the management conditions (litter quality, temperature and humidity) were more important than stocking density.  Ocular dysfunction  In attempts to improve or maintain fast growth, broilers are kept under a range of lighting conditions. These include continuous light (fluorescent and incandescent), continuous darkness, or under dim light; chickens kept under these light conditions develop eye abnormalities such as macrophthalmos, avian glaucoma, ocular enlargement and shallow anterior chambers.  Ammonia  The litter in broiler pens can become highly polluted from the nitrogenous feces of the birds and produce ammonia. Ammonia has been shown to cause increased susceptibility to disease and other health-related problems such as Newcastle disease, airsaculitis and keratoconjunctivitis. The respiratory epithelium in birds is damaged by ammonia concentrations in the air exceeding 75 parts per million (ppm). Ammonia concentrations at 25 to 50 ppm induce eye lesions in broiler chicks after seven days of exposure.  Catching and transport  Once the broilers have reached the target live-weight, they are caught, usually by hand, and packed live into crates for transport to the slaughterhouse. They are usually deprived of food and water for several hours before catching until slaughter. The process of catching, loading, transport and unloading causes serious stress, injury and even death to a large number of broilers. The number of broilers that died in the EU in 2005 during the process of catching, packing and transport was estimated to be as high as 18 to 35 million. In the UK, of broilers that were found to be ‚Äòdead on arrival‚Äô at the slaughterhouse in 2005, it was estimated that up to 40% may have died from thermal stress or suffocation due to crowding on the transporter. Slaughter is done by hanging the birds fully conscious by their feet upside- down in shackles on a moving chain, stunning them by automatically immersing them in an electrified water bath and exsanguination by cutting their throats. Some research indicates that chickens might be more intelligent than previously supposed, which \\"raises questions about how they are treated\\". A possible 10-year life span has been shortened to six weeks for broilers.  Mortality rates  According to historical records, broiler mortality rates in the U.S. have decreased from 18% in 1925 to 3.7% in 2012, but have increased since 2013 to reach 5% in 2018. One indication of the effect of broilers' rapid growth rate on welfare is a comparison of the usual mortality rate for standard broiler chickens (1% per week) with that for slower-growing broiler chickens (0.25% per week) and with young laying hens (0.14% per week); the mortality rate of the fast-growing broilers is seven times the rate of laying hens (the same subspecies) of the same age. = Parent birds = Meat broilers are usually slaughtered at approximately 35 to 49 days of age, well before they become sexually reproductive at 5 to 6 months of age. However, the bird's parents, often called \\"broiler-breeders\\", must live to maturity and beyond so they can be used for breeding. As a consequence, they have additional welfare concerns. Meat broilers have been artificially selected for an extremely high feeding motivation, but are not usually feed-restricted, as this would delay the time taken for them to reach slaughter-weight. Broiler- breeders have the same highly increased feeding motivation, but must be feed- restricted to prevent them becoming overweight with all its concomitant life- threatening problems. An experiment on broilers‚Äô food intake found that 20% of birds allowed to eat as much as they wanted either died or had to be killed because of severe illness between 11 and 20 weeks of age ‚Äì either they became so lame they could not stand or they developed cardiovascular problems. Broiler breeders fed on commercial rations eat only a quarter to a half as much as they would with free access to food. They are highly motivated to eat at all times, presumably leading to chronic frustration of feeding. Because broiler breeders live to adulthood, they might show feather pecking or other injurious pecking behaviour. To avoid this, they might be beak trimmed which can lead to acute or chronic pain.  World production and consumption  Estimated chicken consumption per person in 2012. A report in 2005 stated that around 5.9 billion broiler chickens for eating were produced yearly in the European Union. Mass production of chicken meat is a global industry and at that time, only two or three breeding companies supplied around 90% of the world's breeder-broilers. The total number of meat chickens produced in the world was nearly 47 billion in 2004; of these, approximately 19% were produced in the US, 15% in China, 13% in the EU25 and 11% in Brazil. Consumption of broilers is surpassing that of beef in industrialized countries. Demand in Asia is rising.Meat Atlas 2014 ‚Äì Facts and figures about the animals we eat, p. 41, pdf Worldwide, 86.6 million tonnes of broiler meat were produced in 2014. As of 2018, the worldwide estimation of broiler chick population is approximately 23 billion.  Broiler industry  The commercial production of broiler chickens for meat consumption is a highly industrialized process. There are two major sectors: (1) rearing birds intended for consumption and (2) rearing parent stock for breeding the meat birds.

In 1995, after some criticism that he only invested with other people's money, Johnson took an equity stake along with what was then the Loews chain in the 12-screen multiplex movie theater in Baldwin Hills (now owned by Cinemark). The Beverly Hills‚Äìbased Magic Johnson Enterprises formerly owned Magic Johnson Theatres in four cities, 31 Burger King restaurants in the Southeast, and 13 24-Hour Fitness/Magic Johnson Sport health clubs. Over the years, Magic Johnson Enterprises has continually invested ownership in many lucrative businesses such as the Los Angeles Lakers, movie theaters and restaurants in the United States, including T.G.I. Friday's, Sodexo, and Burger King locations. In March 2008, Johnson signed a multi-year marketing deal to help electronics retailer Best Buy Co. bolster sales in urban neighborhoods. In October 2010, Johnson sold his interest in 105 Starbucks licenses back to the company. The next day he sold his 4% interest in the Los Angeles Lakers for an estimated $27 million to Patrick Soon-Shiong. Johnson's urban investments were formed in 2001 as the Canyon- Johnson Urban Fund, an alliance with Canyon Capital. The alliance has financed 31 real estate developments in 13 states and the District Of Columbia. The first Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund struggled for two years to raise $300 million to invest in urban neighborhoods. A subsequent fund raised $600 million while the third and biggest investment fund was started in April 2008 and drew $1 billion from pension funds and other investors. The Canyon-Johnson fund was involved in the $100-million purchase of the 32-story former Transamerica Center complex in downtown Los Angeles that subsequently was renovated and sold for $205 million. The fund also had a stake in Sunset+Vine in Hollywood, which was built for $125 million and sold for $160 millon. In the summer of 2006, the company made headlines for concluding a deal with Sodexo, one of the largest food services and facilities management companies in the world. The initiative includes a marketing agreement and the formation of SodexoMAGIC, LLC, a new joint venture that is 51 percent owned by Johnson.

The same or similar rock sequences occur across the wider northwest European chalk 'province'. It is characterised by thick deposits of chalk, a soft porous white limestone, deposited in a marine environment. Chalk is a limestone that consists of coccolith biomicrite.As discussed in Chalk Facts by C. S. Harris and Scholle et al. (1983) A biomicrite is a limestone composed of fossil debris (\\"bio\\") and calcium carbonate mud (\\"micrite\\"). Most of the fossil debris in chalk consists of the microscopic plates, which are called coccoliths, of microscopic green algae known as coccolithophores. In addition to the coccoliths, the fossil debris includes a variable, but minor, percentage of the fragments of foraminifera, ostracods and mollusks. The coccolithophores lived in the upper part of the water column. When they died, the microscopic calcium carbonate plates, which formed their shells settled downward through the ocean water and accumulated on the ocean bottom to form a thick layer of calcareous ooze, which eventually became the Chalk Group. The Chalk Group usually shows few signs of bedding, other than lines of flint nodules which become common in the upper part. Nodules of the mineral pyrite also occur and are usually oxidized to brown iron oxide on exposed surfaces. Well-known outcrops include the White Cliffs of Dover, Beachy Head, the southern coastal cliffs of the Isle of Wight and the quarries and motorway cuttings at Blue Bell Hill, Kent, (which has been classified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest) and at the Stokenchurch Gap on the Oxfordshire/Buckinghamshire border where the M40 motorway cuts through the Aston Rowant National Nature Reserve. The Needles, (Isle of Wight); part of southern England's extensive chalk outcrop. Fossil echinoid Echinocorys from the Chalk Group of England Subdivisions The Chalk Group is now divided into a White Chalk Subgroup and a Grey Chalk Subgroup, both of which are further subdivided into formations. These modern divisions replace numerous earlier divisions, references to which occur widely on geological maps and in other geological literature. Previously no subgroups were defined but three formations were identified; the Upper Chalk, Middle Chalk and Lower Chalk. Different formations are defined within the 'northern' and 'southern' provinces, from Norfolk northwards and south of the Thames valley respectively. A 'transitional province' between the two and covering much of East Anglia and the Chiltern Hills is also recognised. A different approach again is taken as regards the succession beneath the North Sea.Hopson, P.M., 2005 A Stratigraphical Framework for the Upper Cretaceous Chalk of England and Scotland with Statements on the Chalk of Northern Ireland and the UK Offshore Sector, British Geological Survey Research Report RR/05/01 (downloaded from www.bgs.ac.uk) =Grey Chalk Subgroup= The Grey Chalk Subgroup (formerly the Lower Chalk minus the Plenus Marls) is usually relatively soft and greyish in colour. It is also the most fossiliferous (especially for ammonite fossils). The strata of this subgroup usually begin with the 'Glauconitic Marl Member' (formerly known as the Glauconitic or Chloritic Marl), named after the grains of the green minerals glauconite and chlorite which it contains. The remainder of the subgroup is argillaceous in its lower part (the West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation (formerly the 'Chalk Marl') and becomes progressively purer in the 'Zig-zag Chalk Formation' (the former 'Grey Chalk'). In the central Chilterns the two parts are separated by the hard Totternhoe Stone, which forms a prominent scarp in some places. There are few, if any, flint nodules present. These two formations are not recognised within the northern province i.e. the outcrop north from East Anglia to Yorkshire, where the entire sequence is now referred to as the 'Ferriby Chalk Formation'. The thickness of the Grey Chalk Subgroup strata varies, averaging around , depending upon the location. They often contains fossils such as the ammonites Schloenbachia, Scaphites, and Mantelliceras, the belemnite Actinocamax, and the bivalves Inoceramus and Ostrea. Contact between two units of the lithostratigraphy of South England: the Chalk Group (left, white, upper unit) and the Greensand Formation (right, green, lower unit). Location: Lulworth Cove, near West Lulworth, Dorset, England. =White Chalk Subgroup= The White Chalk Subgroup includes what were formerly designated the Middle Chalk and Upper Chalk Formations, together with the Plenus Marls (topmost part of the former Lower Chalk Formation). In the southern province it is divided in the following way (youngest/uppermost at top): * Portsdown Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk' and the equivalent of Rowe Chalk Formation, below) * Culver Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk') ** Spetisbury Chalk Member (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk') ** Tarrant Chalk Member (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk') * Newhaven Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk') * Seaford Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk') * Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk') * New Pit Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Middle Chalk') * Holywell Nodular Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Middle Chalk') ** Plenus Marls Member In the northern province the sequence is divided thus: * Rowe Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk' and the equivalent of Portsdown Chalk Formation, above) * Flamborough Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk') * Burnham Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk') * Welton Chalk Formation (formerly 'Middle Chalk') ** Plenus Marls Member In the southern province, the former Middle Chalk, now the Holywell Nodular Chalk Formation and overlying New Pit Formation, averages about in thickness. The sparse fossils found in this sequence include the brachiopod Terebratulina and the echinoid Conulus. The former Upper Chalk by comparison is softer than the underlying sequence and the flint nodules it contains are far more abundant in the South of England, although in Yorkshire the underlying strata have the highest concentration of flints. It may contain ammonite and gastropod fossils in some nodular layers. The thickness of this sequence varies greatly, often averaging around . Fossils may be abundant and include the bivalve Spondylus, the brachiopods Terebratulina and Gibbithyris, the echinoids Sternotaxis, Micraster, Echinocorys, and Tylocidaris, the crinoid Marsupites, and the small sponge Porosphaera. The youngest beds of the sequence are found on the coast of Norfolk. Other fossils commonly found in this formation include: solitary corals (such as Parasmilia), marine worm tubes (such as Rotularia), bryozoans, scattered fragments of starfish and fish remains (including shark teeth such as Cretolamna and Squalicorax).  Chalk landscapes of England  The Wealden Anticline. The Chalk outcrops across large parts of southern and eastern England and forms a significant number of the major physiographical features. Whilst it has been postulated that a chalk cover was laid down across just about all of England and Wales during Cretaceous times, subsequent uplift and erosion has resulted in it remaining only southeast of a line drawn roughly between The Wash and Lyme Bay in Dorset and eastwards from the scarps of the Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Wolds. Gentle folding of the Mesozoic rocks of this region during the Alpine orogeny has produced the London Basin and the Weald‚ÄìArtois Anticline, the Hampshire Basin and the less gentle Purbeck-Wight monocline. The broadly western margin of the Chalk outcrop is marked, from northeast to southwest, to south by the Chalk downlands of the Yorkshire Wolds, the Lincolnshire Wolds, a subdued feature through western Norfolk, including Breckland, the Chiltern Hills, the Berkshire Downs, Marlborough Downs and the western margins of Salisbury Plain and Cranborne Chase and the North and South Dorset Downs.Ordnance Survey 1:625,000 scale Physical Map of Great Britain sheet 2 In parts of the Thames Basin and eastern East Anglia the Chalk is concealed by later deposits, as is the case too within the Hampshire Basin. Ivinghoe Beacon, Chiltern Hills Only where the Weald‚ÄìArtois Anticline has been 'unroofed' by erosion i.e. within the Weald is the Chalk entirely absent. In this area the long north-facing scarp of the South Downs and the longer south-facing scarp of the North Downs face one another across the Weald. For similar reasons, the Chalk is largely absent from the rather smaller area to the south of the Purbeck-Wight Monocline, save for the downs immediately north of Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. Some of the best exposures of the Chalk are where these ranges intersect the coast to produce dramatic, often vertical cliffs as at Flamborough Head, the White Cliffs of Dover, Seven Sisters, Old Harry Rocks (Purbeck) and The Needles on the Isle of Wight. The Chalk, which once extended across the English Channel, gives rise to similar cliff features on the French coast. Offshore and elsewhere =Northern Ireland= In the 'Ulster Cretaceous Province' of Northern Ireland the clastic-dominated Hibernian Greensands Group and the overlying Ulster White Limestone Group are the stratigraphical equivalents of the Chalk Group of England. They are best exposed near the Antrim coast. =Scotland= In the 'Scottish Chalk Province' (extending from Mull to Skye) the Inner Hebrides Group is the stratigraphical equivalent of England's Chalk Group. It comprises largely sandstones and mudstones though the Santonian age Gribun Chalk Formation of Mull and nearby Morvern is recognised. =The Low Countries= The Dutch () and Belgian () equivalents of the Chalk Group are basically continuous and crop out as a slightly northwest dipping monocline in a belt from the German city of Aachen to the city of Mons, where they join Cretaceous deposits of the Paris Basin. North of Namur the Cretaceous is overlain by younger Paleocene and Eocene deposits of the Landen Group. In the Low Countries, the Chalk Group succession is divided into five formations, from top to base:; 2004: Engineering Geology for Infrastructure Planning in Europe, Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences 104, Springer, , p. 491 *the Houthem Formation, consisting of Paleocene calcareous arenites; *the Maastricht Formation, consisting of Maastrichtian chalk and calcareous arenites; *the Gulpen Formation, consisting of Campanian to Maastrichtian chalk; *the Vaals Formation, consisting of alternating Campanian clays, glauconiferous sands and silts; *the Aachen Formation, consisting of Santonian glauconiferous sands and silts. In Belgium, the Houthem Formation is sometimes not included in the Chalk Group because it is not a Cretaceous formation. Some stratigraphers therefore prefer to put it in the lower Paleogene Hesbaye Group. =The English Channel= The Channel Tunnel linking England and France was constructed by tunnelling through the West Melbury Marly Chalk (formerly the 'Chalk Marl' - a prominent sub-unit of the Grey Chalk Subgroup). =The North Sea= The chalk is also an important petroleum reservoir in the North Sea Central Graben, mainly in Norwegian and Danish sectors and to a lesser extent in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf sector (UKCS). Across the north central and northern North Sea, the Chalk Group is a major seal unit, overlying a number of blocks of reservoir rocks and preventing their fluid contents from migrating upwards. North of the line of the Mid-North Sea - Ringkobing - Fyn structural high, the Chalk Group is still recognisable in drilled samples, but becomes increasingly muddy northwards. North of the Beryl Embayment (59¬∞30' N 01¬∞30'E), the Chalk Group is a series of slightly to moderately calcareous mudstones grouped under the name of the Shetland Group. With the exception of some thin sandy units in the inner Moray Firth, this sequence has neither source potential nor reservoir capacity and is not generally considered a drilling target. Its thickness and homogeneity does make it a common target for carrying out directional drilling manoeuvers. In the Shearwater and Eastern Trough Area Project areas (around 56¬∞30' N 02¬∞30'E, UKCS quadrants 22,23,29 and 30), the Chalk Group can be significantly overpressured. Further south in UKCS quadrant 30 and Norwegian quadrants 1 and 2, this overpressure helps preserve porosity and enables the Chalk to be an effective reservoir. =Reservoir stratigraphy= *Chalk Unit 6 - Ekofisk Formation - Danian age (major reservoir in the Ekofisk oil field and others) *Chalk Unit 5 - Tor Formation - Maastrichtian age, (major reservoir in many fields including Joanne oil field (UKCS), Valhall oil field (NCS)) *Chalk Unit 4 - Hod Formation - Late Campanian age (mostly non reservoir) *Chalk Unit 3 - Hod Formation - Santonian to Middle Campanian *Chalk Unit 2 - Hod Formation - Middle Turonian to Coniacian *Turonian shale - Early Turonian (non reservoir) *Plenus Marl - Late Cenomanian (non reservoir) *Chalk Unit 1 - Hidra Formation - Cenomanian (non reservoir) =Reservoir geology= The majority of Chalk reservoirs are redeposited allochthonous beds. These include debris flows and turbidite flows. Porosities can be very high when preserved from diagenesis by early hydrocarbon charge. However, when these hydrocarbons are produced, diagenesis and compaction can restart which has led to several metres of subsidence at seabed, the collapse of a number of wells, and some extremely expensive remedial work to lift the platforms and re-position them.  Fossils  Fossils of the echinoid Micraster from the Chalk Group have been studied for their continuous morphogical variation throughout the record. Mosasaur remains referred to \\"Mosasaurus\\" gracillis from the Turonian aged Chalk Group deposits actually are more closely allied to the Russellosaurina. A single partial maxillar tooth from Cenomanian aged Chalk Group described as \\"Iguanodon hilli\\" belongs to a non-Hadrosaurid Hadrosauroid.Dalla Vecchia FM. (2009b) European hadrosauroids.

Etymology The name of Shisui in the Japanese language is formed from three kanji characters. The first, , means \\"sake\\", The second, , is an ideographic iteration mark, indicating a repetition of the first character, and the third, means \\"well\\". The area in present-day Shisui was noted for its freshwater springs, and a local legend arose that pure sake gushed freely from the ground, creating \\"wells of sake\\". Geography Shisui is located on the Shim≈çsa Plateau in northern Chiba Prefecture. The town overlooks the Inba Marsh. The town sits on relatively flat, even ground. The south of Shisui is crossed by three small rivers: the Takazaki, Egawa, and Nakagawa, all of which empty into the Inba Marsh. =Neighboring municipalities= *Narita, Chiba *Inzai, Chiba *Sakura, Chiba *Yachimata, Chiba *Tomisato, Chiba History The area around Shisui has been inhabited since at least the Japanese Paleolithic, and archaeologists have found stone tools and the foundations of houses dating 24,000 years ago. During the Muromachi period, the area was under control of the Chiba clan. After the start of the Edo period, much of the area of Shisui was part of Sakura Domain, a feudal domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration, Shisui Town was founded on April 1, 1889 within Inba District of Chiba Prefecture. Proposals to merge Shisui with the neighboring city of Sakura failed to pass a public referendum in 2002. Economy Shisui was historically a center of rice and sake production. The town is located directly south of Narita International Airport. The central part of the town was developed as a regional commercial center beginning in 1975 due to the construction and expansion of the airport.

A state government may have some level of political autonomy, or be subject to the direct control of the federal government. This relationship may be defined by a constitution. The reference to \\"state\\" denotes country subdivisions which are officially or widely known as \\"states\\", and should not be confused with a \\"sovereign state\\". Most federations designate their federal units \\"state\\" or the equivalent term in the local language; however in some federations other designations are used such as Oblast or Republic. Some federations are asymmetric, designating greater powers to some federal units than others. Provinces are usually divisions of unitary states but occasionally the designation is also given to the federal units such as the Provinces of Argentina or Canada. Their governments, which are also provincial governments, are not the subject of this article. Australia The Commonwealth of Australia is a federal nation with six states (and two mainland territories). Section 51 of the Australian Constitution sets out the division of legislative power between the states and the Commonwealth (federal) government. The Commonwealth government is given a variety of legislative powers, including control of foreign policy, taxation (although this cannot discriminate between states or parts of states), and regulation of interstate commerce and corporations.Section 51 of the Australian Constitution at theamericanParliament website Since the original ratification of the constitution, the High Court of Australia has settled a number of disputes concerning the extent of the Commonwealth's legislative powers, some of which have been controversial and extensively criticised; these included a dispute in 1982 over whether the Commonwealth was entitled to designate land for national heritage purposes under United Nations agreements,Barwick, Sir Garfield, A View of the External Affairs Power, Samuel Griffith Society as well as numerous disputes over the extent of the Commonwealth's power over trade union and industrial relations legislation. (2000) 24(3) Melbourne University Law Review 839. One difference between the Australian and United States models of federalism is that, in Australia, the Commonwealth Parliament has explicit constitutional power over marriage legislation; this has been a focal point for recent controversies over same-sex marriage.The High Court and the Meaning of 'Marriage' in Section 51(xxi) of the Constitution, Australian Parliamentary Library =Government structure= Each state of Australia has a governor, who represents the Queen of Australia (currently Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom) and performs the ceremonial duties of a head of state. Every state also has a parliament; most states have a bicameral parliament, except for Queensland, where the upper chamber (the Legislative Council) was abolished in 1922., Queensland Parliament website Like their Indian counterparts, Australian states have a Westminster system of parliamentary government; the head of government, known in each state as a Premier, is drawn from the state parliament. India In India, the state governments are the level of governments below the Government of India. India is a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a Parliamentary system of government. The Republic is governed in terms of the Constitution of India. Sovereignty is shared between the union and the state government, but the union government is given greater powers. The President is the constitutional head Executive of the State. Real executive power vests in a Union Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as head of government. The States resembles the federal system. In the states, the Governor is the head of Executive, but real executive power vests with the Chief Minister who heads the Council of Ministers. The judicial setup of the country is headed by the Chief Justice of India at federal level, who presides over one of the largest judicial apparatus dispensing criminal, civil and all other forms of litigation, and Chief Justices of the High Courts at state level. The government head of its legal wing is the Attorney General of India at federal level and Advocate General at state level.  Nigeria In Nigeria, States are constituent political entities of which there are currently 36. States have an elected Governor and legislature and broad powers in some areas. Powers not given to the states belong to the federal government under the Constitution of Nigeria. Pakistan In Pakistan, the Provinces of Pakistan are the federal units. There are currently four. The Provincial Governments are each headed formally by a Provincial Governor but for practical purposes power is exercised by the Chief Minister, in a parliamentary system similar to that of the Federal government of Pakistan . South Africa South Africa is usually considered a unitary state but its government system possesses a strong similarity to a federal one. The Constitution of South Africa does not describe the state as federal or unitary. South Africa is divided into nine provinces which have their own elected governments. Chapter Six of the Constitution of South Africa describes the division of power between the national government and the provincial governments, listing those \\"functional areas\\" of government that are exclusively reserved to the provincial governments and those where both levels of government have concurrent powers; the remaining areas not listed are reserved to the national government. In areas where both levels have concurrent powers there is a complex set of rules in the event of a conflict between national and provincial legislation. Generally in such a case the provincial legislation prevails, but national legislation may prescribe standards and frameworks for provinces to follow, and may prevent provinces from adversely affecting national interests or the interests of other provinces. The functional areas in which the provincial governments have powers include agriculture, arts and culture, primary and secondary education, the environment and tourism, health, housing, roads and transport, and social welfare. The provincial governments are structured according to a parliamentary system in which the executive is dependent on and accountable to the legislature. The unicameral provincial legislature is elected by party- list proportional representation, and the legislature in turn elects one of its members as Premier to head the executive. The Premier appoints an Executive Council (a cabinet), consisting of members of the legislature, to administer the various departments of the provincial administration. United States The United States is divided into 50 states, which comprise the federal entities. Under the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, all governmental powers not granted to the Federal government of the United States nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, making the United States a decentralised federation. However, State law is trumped by Federal law when the two may come into contact. U.S. states all share a similar system of government to the national level with a directly elected and usually quite powerful executive styled Governor and a state legislature exercising legislative authority. In 49 states out of 50 as well as three of the inhabited Territories of the United States (Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa), the legislature is bicameral with the houses commonly, though not exclusively being styled House of Representatives and Senate although the name of the legislative body as a whole varies between the states (the most common are General Assembly (Itself sometimes a term for the lower house of a state legislature) such as in North Carolina or simply Legislature as in Texas). In Nebraska, United States Virgin Islands and Guam (the latter two being federal territories rather than states) the legislature is unicameral. The states are semi-sovereign republics in their own right and maintain much control over their internal affairs with issues such as public transport and law enforcement generally being the domain of state governments (although the Federal government often works with states in these areas). Large portions of the welfare state in the United States are administered at a state level as well which means that levels of social services vary from state to state. This has sometimes been controversial, such as in the case of Medicaid expansion. There are also several territories, the most notable of which is Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is treated in a manner similar to a state in many areas but in others is quite different. Most notably it does not have representation in the United States Congress other than its non-voting Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. However, it does enjoy more autonomy in taxation and some other areas than the states and thus is commonly classified as a sort of autonomous region for the Puerto Rican people, who are culturally distinct from the Americans on the mainland. There exists a debate as to the future status of the territory with proposals including full statehood, maintenance of the autonomous territory status, or some form of independence (either retaining limited reliance upon the United States or full independence with no special relationship) See also * Constituent state * Federated state * Confederated state * Associated state * List of U.S. state legislatures References Category:Public governance Category:Forms of government * Category:Government institutions Category:Political terminology ","title":"State government"},{"id":"862859","title":"French America"},{"id":"862861","text":"John Cunningham VC (28 June 1897 - 21 February 1941) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Description  Types of reefers: Reefer ships may be categorised into three types: # Side-door vessels have water-tight ports on the ship's hull, which open into a cargo hold. Elevators or ramps leading from the quay serve as loading and discharging access for the forklifts or conveyors. Inside these access ports or side doors, pallet lifts or another series of conveyors bring the cargo to the respective decks. This special design makes the vessels particularly well suited for inclement weather operations as the tops of the cargo holds are always closed against rain and sun. # Conventional vessels have a traditional cargo operation with top opening hatches and cranes/derricks. On such ships, when facing wet weather, the hatches need to be closed to prevent heavy rain from flooding the holds. Both above ship types are well suited for the handling of palletized and loose cargo. # Refrigerated container ships are specifically designed to carry containerised unit loads where each container has its individual refrigerated unit. These containers are nearly always twenty-foot equivalent units (often called TEU) that are the size of \\"standard\\" cargo containers that are loaded and unloaded at container terminals and aboard container ships. These ships differ from conventional container ships in their design, power generation, and electrical distribution equipment. They need provisions made for powering each container's cooling system. Because of their ease of loading and unloading cargo many container ships are now being built or redesigned to carry refrigerated containers. Unloading frozen pork from the Clan Line ship Clan MacDougall in the mid-20th century A major use of refrigerated cargo hold type ships was for the transportation of bananas and frozen meat, but most of these ships have been partly replaced by refrigerated containers that have a refrigeration system attached to the rear end of the container. While on a ship these containers are plugged into an electrical outlet (typically 440 VAC) that ties into the ship's power generation. Refrigerated container ships are not limited by the number of refrigeration containers they can carry, unlike other container ships which may be limited in their number of refrigeration outlets or have insufficient generator capacity. Each reefer container unit is typically designed with a stand-alone electrical circuit and has its own breaker switch that allows it to be connected and disconnected as required. In principle each individual unit could be repaired while the ship was still underway. Refrigerated cargo is a key part of the income for some shipping companies. On multi-purpose ships, refrigerated containers are mostly carried above deck, as they have to be checked for proper operation. Also, a major part of the refrigeration system (such as a compressor) may fail, which would have to be replaced or unplugged quickly in the event of a fire. Modern container vessels stow the reefer containers in cellguides with adjacent inspection walkways that enable reefer containers to be carried in the holds as well as on the deck. Modern refrigerated container vessels are designed to incorporate a water-cooling system for containers stowed under deck. This does not replace the refrigeration system but facilitates cooling down of the external machinery. Containers stowed on the exposed upper deck are air- cooled, while those under deck are water-cooled. The water cooling design allows capacity loads of refrigerated containers under deck as it enables the dissipation of the high amount of heat they generate. This system draws fresh water from the ship's water supply, which in turn transfers the heat through heat exchangers to the abundantly available sea water. The reefer ship Dole Honduras unloading bananas in the Port of San Diego There are also refrigeration systems that have two compressors for very precise and low- temperature operations, such as transporting a container of blood to a war zone. Cargoes of shrimp, asparagus, caviar and blood are considered among the most expensive refrigerated items. Bananas, fruit and meat have historically been the main cargo of refrigerated ships.  History of ship refrigeration  By 1869, reefers were shipping beef carcasses frozen in a salt-ice mixture from Indianola, Texas, to New Orleans, Louisiana, to be served in hospitals, hotels and restaurants. By 1874 they were shipping frozen beef from America to London, which developed into an annual tonnage of around . The insulated cargo space was cooled by ice, which was loaded on departure. The success of this method was limited by insulation, loading techniques, ice block size, distance and climate. The first attempt to ship refrigerated meat was made when the Northam sailed from Australia to the UK in 1876. The refrigeration machinery broke down en route and the cargo was lost. In 1877, the steamers Frigorifique and Paraguay carried frozen mutton from Argentina to France, proving the concept of refrigerated ships, if not the economics. In 1879 Strathleven, equipped with compression refrigeration, sailed successfully from Sydney to the UK with 40 tons of frozen beef and mutton as a small part of her cargo. , first refrigerated clipper ship to complete a successful shipment of refrigerated meat The clipper sailing ship , owned by the New Zealand and Australian Land Company (NZALC), was refitted in 1881 with a Bell-Coleman compression refrigeration machine. This steam-powered freezer unit worked by compressing air, then releasing it into the hold of the ship. The expanding air absorbed heat as it expanded, cooling the cargo in the hold. Using three tons of coal a day, this steam powered machine could chill the hold to below the surrounding air temperature, freezing the cargo in the temperate climate of southern New Zealand, and then maintaining it below freezing () through the tropics. Dunedins most visible sign of being an unusual ship was the funnel for the refrigeration plant placed between her fore and main masts (sometimes leading her to be mistaken for a steamship which had been common since the 1840s). In February 1882, Dunedin sailed from Port Chalmers New Zealand with 4,331 mutton, 598 lamb and 22 pig carcasses, 246 kegs of butter, and hare, pheasant, turkey, chicken and 2,226 sheep tongues and arrived in London after sailing 98 days with its cargo still frozen. After meeting all costs, the NZALC company made a ¬£4,700 profit from the voyage. Soon after Dunedins successful voyage, an extensive frozen meat trade from New Zealand and Australia to the UK was developed with over 16 different refrigerated and passenger refrigerated ships built or refitted by 1900 in Scotland and Northern England shipyards for this trade. Within 5 years, 172 shipments of frozen meat were sent from New Zealand to the United Kingdom. Refrigerated shipping also led to a broader meat and dairy boom in Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. Frozen meat and dairy exports continued to form the backbone of New Zealand's. As of 2012, New Zealand has no refrigerated cargo ships. Loading Clan McDougall with frozen meat for England. Archives New Zealand The Nelson brothers, butchers in County Meath, Ireland, started shipping extensive live beef shipments to Liverpool, England. They successfully expanded their beef business until their imports from Ireland were insufficient to supply their rapidly growing business and Nelson decided to investigate the possibility of importing meat from Argentina. The first refrigerated ship they bought was Spindrift which they renamed in 1890 SS Highland Scot. A vessel of 3,060 gross tons bought by James Nelson and Sons in 1889 and fitted with a somewhat primitive refrigerating plant operating on the cold air system became one of the pioneer vessels in the trade of refrigerated meat and other perishable commodities. They hauled beef carcasses from Argentina to Britain. Their regularly scheduled shipments and ships developed into the Nelson Line that was formed in 1880 for the meat trade from Argentina to UK. Refrigeration made it possible to import meat from the United States, New Zealand, Argentina and Australia. All of their ships had a \\"Highland\\" first name. The Nelson Line began passenger service in 1910 between London, England and Buenos Aires and in 1913 came under control of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. In 1932 Royal Mail Group collapsed, Royal Mail Lines Ltd was founded, and Nelson Line merged into the new company. =Timeline= *In 1876, French engineer Charles Tellier bought the ex-Elder-Dempster 690 tons cargo ship Eboe and fitted a Methyl-ether refrigerating plant of his design. The ship was renamed Le Frigorifique and successfully imported a cargo of refrigerated meat from Argentina. However the machinery could be improved and in 1877 another refrigerated ship called Paraguay with a refrigerating plant improved by Ferdinand Carr√© was put into service on the South American run. *In 1879, Henry Bell (1848‚Äì1931) and John Bell (1850‚Äì1929) of Scotland and Joseph James Coleman FRSE (1838‚Äì1888) of Scotland completed the Bell‚ÄìColeman dense-air machine on the Anchor liner Circassia, which successfully brought a cargo of chilled beef from the US to London. *In 1880, Strathleven, equipped with a Bell‚ÄìColeman air machine and loaded with successfully shipped beef, mutton, butter and kegs, sailed from Melbourne, Australia to London‚Äîa nine-week voyage of about . *In 1881, Alfred Seale Haslam (1844‚Äì1927) of England equipped the liner Orient with Haslam refrigeration compressors. He bought the Bell‚ÄìColeman dense-air patents in 1878 and eventually equipped four hundred plants and ships with Bell-Coleman machines. *By 1899, refrigerated fruit ship traffic to the US reached 90,000 tons per year. *By 1890, after acquiring the patent rights of Franz Windhausen's CO2-compression refrigeration system, the J & E Hall company installed the first marine CO2 refrigerator system on the Nelson Line ship Highland Chief. *In 1900, a worldwide survey found 356 refrigerated ships, 37% of which had air machines, 37% ammonia compressors and 25% CO2 compressors. *In 1900, Great Britain imported over 360,000 metric tons of refrigerated meat: 220,000 tons from Argentina, 95,000 tons from New Zealand and 45,000 tons from Australia. There were weekly sailings on refrigerated \\"banana boats\\" from the UK to Central America by Elders and Fyffes Ltd, which had been importing bananas since 1888 to the UK in their own ships. Round trips took 28 days. *In 1901, the first refrigerated banana ship, Port Morant, was equipped with a CO2 machine and carried 23,000 stems of bananas at a controlled temperature from Jamaica to the UK. *In 1902, Lloyd's Register recorded 460 ships with refrigerating plants. *By 1902, the United Fruit Company started having refrigerated banana boats built in the UK to add to their fleet which hauled passengers and bananas between ports in the United States and Central America. *By 1910, UK refrigerated meat imports rose to 760,000 tons per year. *By 1910, the British company J & E Hall had installed 1800 CO2 refrigeration machines in ships. *By 1913, the UK fleet included 230 refrigerated ships with a total cargo capacity of 440,000 tons. *By 1935, refrigerated imports into Britain totaled of meat, 500,000 tons of butter, 130,000 tons of cheese, 430,000 tons of apples and pears, and 20 million stems of bananas. United Fruit Company reefer ships The United Fruit Company has used some type of reefers, often combined with cruise ship passenger accommodations, since about 1889. Because of their cargo was mostly bananas, they were nicknamed the \\"Banana Fleet\\". Since bananas are relatively light and the normal shipping route was to Central America and then back to various U.S. ports, these ships were often built as combination cargo ships and what are now called cruise ships to pay for more of their operating expenses. After about 1910, they called these combination cruise and cargo ships the \\"Great White Fleet\\". To avoid US shipping regulations and taxes they are registered in about six other countries, with very few now maintaining US registry. European associates with their own ships were often employed to ship fruit to Europe. United Brands was taken over by Chiquita Brands International in the 1980s and owns the largest fleet of banana boats in the world, but none of them now sails under the US flag. SS Pastores and SS Calamares were built in Ireland in 1912 and 1913 for the United Fruit Company as a combination cruise ship and refrigerated cargo ship. The United Fruit Company's fleet of about 85 ships was one of the largest civilian fleets in the world. These ships normally carried up to 95 cruise ship passengers and a crew to ports in Central America and then would return to the United States with passengers and a cargo of refrigerated bananas and miscellaneous cargo. They were part of United Fruit's \\"Great White Fleet\\"‚Äîto minimize heat build-up the ships were all painted white. The renamed and were taken over by the United States Navy in World War I and used to take troops and refrigerated supplies to and from Europe. After hostilities ceased they were returned to United Fruit Company in 1919. They were requisitioned again on 2 June 1941 from United Fruit for use in World War II. After hostilities ceased they were then returned again to United Fruit Company in 1946. Reefers in U.S. Navy service =World War I= In World War I, the US Navy contracted for 18 refrigerated ships for hauling provisions to the troops in Europe. They were launched 1918 and 1919 as the war was ending and were nearly all scrapped by 1933 in the Great Depression as an economy move. Most were built in Baltimore Dry Dock in Baltimore, Maryland, Moore SB in Oakland, California and Standard SB Co. in Shooter's Island, New York. =World War II= United Fruit Co's SS Quirigua The s were six United Fruit passenger and refrigerated cargo liners built in 1931‚Äì1933 that the United States Maritime Commission requisitioned in 1941‚Äì1942. They were USS Antigua, , , , and . Antigua, although requisitioned, was never commissioned into the Navy. United States Maritime Commission Type R ship were Reefer ships. NOTE: also requisitioned from the United Fruit Co. was SS Ulua; which became . It was the last of the UFC 'reefer' ships to be taken over; which happened near the end of April 1943 in San Francisco. Other \\"reefers\\" converted for US Navy use were the Danish ships , and . In addition, the US Maritime Commission ordered 41 new refrigerated ships for the Navy. Because of the difficulty of building refrigerated ships only two were delivered in 1944. 26 were delivered in 1945 and the remainder in 1946‚Äì1948. Worldwide service According to the CIA's The World Factbook, there were about 38,000 registered merchant ships in the world in 2010, of which about 920 were designed as refrigerated cargo ships. Because of the proliferation of self-contained refrigerated container systems on container ships, there are many more ships than those designed for only refrigerated cargo that are also carrying some refrigerated cargo. As of 2010, the countries with the largest numbers of reefer ships in their registries are the world's two most prominent flags of convenience: Panama with 212 and Liberia with 109.

The player is in charge of a squad of between one and eight men that can be, for command purposes, split up to three groups (referred to as Snake, Eagle and Panther squads). All men have a machine gun with unlimited ammunition, as well as limited caches of grenades and rockets that can be found on the map. In later levels, the player is provided with some grenades and rockets at the start of the mission. The player's machine guns do not harm its own soldiers, but friendly fire from grenades and rockets is possible, which are also the only weapons capable of destroying buildings and vehicles. Men can also die if hit by debris flung from exploding buildings and vehicles, get caught in man-traps, mired in quicksand, and hit by enemy fire. Men usually walk, but several vehicles are available in some missions. The games are split into several missions, which are usually sub-divided into phases. Dead soldiers are replaced by new ones at the start of each phase. Each soldier that survives a mission is promoted and receives a small increase in the rate of fire, accuracy, and range. The player is only able to save the game upon completion of a whole mission. Each phase is structured around mission objectives which range from \\"Kill all enemies\\" or \\"Destroy enemy buildings\\" to \\"Rescue all hostages\\". Some phases are complex, and require the player to use their imagination, pre-planning and strategy. For example, players may have to split their team into two or more groups and leave one group to defend an area or route, assigning its control to the game's artificial intelligence, while taking control of another group. The pre-mission screen shows a hill with a grave for each dead soldier, with recruits lining up in front of it and a sports-like score at the top of the screen. Soldiers each have unique names, while on the grand scale of things being nothing more than interchangeable cannon fodder. The game has hundreds of individually named recruits, of which the first few ‚Äî Jools, Jops, Stoo and Rj ‚Äî were named directly after the development staff. As each recruit is killed in battle, he receives a tombstone on the hill and the next recruit in line takes his place. Cannon Fodder 2 introduced a variety of new settings: a Middle Eastern conflict, an alien planet and spaceraft, the medieval and gangster-themed Chicago. It nevertheless retained the same mechanics and gameplay. In the new settings, troops wielding grenades and rockets were replaced by such units as aliens and wizards, but nonetheless behaved in the same manner, as did battering rams representing trucks and so forth. The game was more difficult than its predecessor, employing puzzle elements such as multiple ways -of varying effectiveness- to solve levels. It featured reduced use of water obstacles but retained mines and booby traps. Cannon Fodder 3 featured a military, counter-terrorism theme with more advanced weather settings. It retained grenades and rockets as the central secondary weapons and introduced further power-ups. It expanded the selection of vehicles and added further enemy installations such as sniper towers. It also features an online cooperative mode. Music video The theme tune for the game (\\"War!\\") was written by the lead game designer Jon Hare, with musician Richard Joseph. Vocals were sung by Hare himself. A music video of the song was put together to promote the original release . Shot over just one day and for a total budget of ¬£500, it featured the entire team dressed up in military uniforms, an assortment of masks (including one of Mario and Donald Duck) and toy guns. The version of the music track is more complete than the one that appeared on the 16-bit versions and was recorded professionally. In fact, the menu screen track is also a pared down version of a proper song, featuring studio-standard vocals. Both of these tracks were written and performed by Jon Hare, as were many of the other songs featured in Sensible's games. Games =Cannon Fodder= New recruits queue near the tombstones. Production of Cannon Fodder began following the completion of the successful strategy game Mega Lo Mania. Sensible Software wanted to create another strategy game featuring mouse control and the notion of sending troops on missions, but with more action than had been used in Mega Lo Mania. Production began in 1991 but was slowed due to Mega Drive conversions of other games. Cannon Fodder lost its provisional publisher in the aftermath of owner Robert Maxwell's death. As development work resumed, the team gradually reduced the complexity the strategy gameplay in favour of more direct control and action gameplay. In May 1993, Sensible Software found a new publisher in Virgin Interactive, which released the game in November of that year.CU Amiga, Oct 1993, pp. 65-66 Amiga magazines rated the game positively, widely awarding scores of over 90%, while Amiga Action awarded an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year.Steve McNally, Amiga Action (issue 53, Jan 1994), pp. 24-25 Critics praised the fun, addictiveness, music and humour of the game. The game also drew criticism in the Daily Star for its juxtaposition of war and humour and its use of iconography closely resembling the remembrance poppy.Jonathan Guy, Daily Star, 26 Oct, 1993 Ports Game Boy Color - Once Sensible Software was sold off to Codemasters, the decision was taken to port the game over to the Game Boy Color. The limit on having two men in your squad and a much smaller playing area meant changes had to be made to the gameplay, mainly to make it easier. Jon Hare described the change as converting \\"11-a-side football to 5-a-side football\\". Mobile phone - In 2004, Jon Hare set up a small mobile phone games team known as Tower Studios. Their first release was Sensible Soccer in 2004, followed by Cannon Fodder in 2005. Both titles were published by Kuju Entertainment. The games were only playable on certain color models and due to many keypads' inability to register a diagonal movement the control systems for both games had to be radically redesigned. =Cannon Soccer= In 1994, a free minigame called Cannon Soccer (or Cannon Fodder - Amiga Format Christmas Special) was included on the coverdisk of the Amiga Format Christmas issue. It was essentially two bonus levels of Cannon Fodder in which the soldiers fought hordes of Sensible Soccer players in a snowy landscape. The levels were titled \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and \\"It's Snow Time\\". =Sensible Soccer 92/93 Meets Bulldog Blighty= :Also known as Sensible Soccer: England vs Germany One of the demos on the Amiga Power cover disk 21 was Sensible Soccer Meets Bulldog Blighty. It featured a mode of play that involved replacing players with soldiers from Cannon Fodder, and the ball with a hand grenade. The grenade would randomly begin to flash and would eventually explode after a few minutes, killing any nearby players. The magazine described it as a \\"1944 version of Sensible Soccer\\",Amiga Power Jan 1993 (issue 21), pp. 6-7 though The Daily Telegraph compared it to the Christmas-time football match in 1914.The best violent video games of all time, The Daily Telegraph, Retrieved 24 July 2012 =Cannon Fodder 2= Cannon Fodder 2 is a 1995 sequel featuring very similar gameplay and graphics to the point where an Amiga Computing review suggested it had more in common with a data disk than a true sequel. The game featured levels set in deserts and an Alien spaceship as well as levels with a medieval theme. Amiga Computing rated the game at 71%. The designer Stuart Campbell wrote, \\"CF2 was a cross-cultural kinda game. Levels were inspired by films, music, other games, politics and events. Titles came from songs, books, and all manner of other sources.\\"Cannon Fodder 2 development history by Stuart Campbell =Cancelled sequels= After selling Sensible Software to Codemasters, Jon Hare ended up consulting on many of their development projects, one of which was the PS2 title Prince Naseem Boxing. Work on this title was performed in a satellite studio based in Hammersmith, London. However, due to the commercial failure of this title, the studio was shut down. A casualty of this was cancellation of a 3D remake of Cannon Fodder, something that Hare had been working on for at least nine months. Hare did speak about how he was looking to expand on the whole theme of war and include gameplay not just set on the battlefield: \\"I'd like to focus on the public's perceptions of war and warfare. There's many interesting things that go on behind the scenes with politicians\\". In an interview with Eurogamer in late 2005, Hare confirmed that there was up to two years' work (on and off) put into a 3D update of Cannon Fodder: \\"I designed Cannon Fodder 3 with Codies six years ago, development stopped and started three times and eventually it was seemingly permanently halted when the London studio was closed four years ago. Nothing would please me more than to see this project resurrected, it was very advanced in its structure and therefore would need little modernisation.\\"A Sensible Decision Interview ‚Ä¢ Interviews ‚Ä¢ Eurogamer.net On August 28, 2006, Codemasters London announced that a brand new version of Cannon Fodder would appear for the PlayStation Portable. The game would have retained its familiar top down view, and the big heads of the soldiers, and for the first time the game would have been 3D. After a large launch announcement which included character renders and screenshots, the game was quietly canceled without explanation. In a later interview, Hare said \\"Unfortunately, through no fault of their own, Codemasters hit economic problems and had to sell the studio, so everything just went.\\" =Cannon Fodder 3= In 2008,Wesley Yin-Poole, Will Cannon Fodder 3 release in the UK?, Eurogamer, 18 Jan 2011, Retrieved 14 July 2012 now intellectual property owner Codemasters licensed Russian publisher Game Factory Interactive to develop another sequel.

The temple is known for numerous historically significant buildings and gardens, national cultural assets, as well as features like the old weeping cherry trees that line its Tatch≈´ (main path lined with lodging temples). History According to Nichiren Shoshu tradition, Taiseki-ji was founded in 1290 by Nichiren's disciple Nikk≈ç on a tract of land called donated by the district steward, Nanjo Shichiro Jiro Hyoe Taira no Tokimitsu (Buddhist name: Daigyo Sonrei) (1259‚Äì1332). The name derives from an alternative reading of the kanji for ≈åishi (Â§ßÁü≥), Tai (Big) - Seki (Stone), and the character Ji (ÂØ∫), temple. Tokimitsu was one of Nichiren's lay followers and he looked up to Nikk≈ç as his personal teacher. Taiseki-ji started with one small temple building, the Mutsubo with six rooms, but grew gradually as Nikk≈ç's disciples built sub-temples. It went through further growth phases during the mid-Edo and in the post-World War II periods. According to Nichiren Shoshu doctrine, Nichiren Daishonin willed that the Dai- Gohonzon of the High Sanctuary of the Essential Teachings to be established at the foot of Mt. Fuji when worldwide propagation was achieved. Pilgrimage Pilgrimage to Taiseki-ji Head Temple, draws adherents of Nichiren Shoshu from all over the world annually through group trips, planned by local branch temples, and individual trips. Pilgrimage, within Nichiren Shoshu, to the Head Temple Taiseki-ji at the base of Mt. Fuji is called, Tozan, literally meaning \\"to climb the mountain.

It was built in 1717 with financial assistance from Lady Tennei-in, the wife of sixth Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienobu, who donated 300 ry≈ç for its construction. In 1997, it was significantly vandalized and defaced with graffiti. It was recently restored and is awaiting public presentation. =Mutsub≈ç= The Mutsub≈ç The first was erected in 1290 as Taiseki-ji's first building. It has been rebuilt many times since, but the Gohonzon (object of veneration) it houses is attributed to temple founder Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin dating from November 1332. It maintains its original design of having six rooms.http://blog.livedoor.jp/saikakudoppo/archives/50865483.html The current structure, which uses much keyaki heartwood, was completed in 1988.

The priesthood cited the Dai- Kyakuden's imposing ferroconcrete mass as incongruent with the architectural tone appropriate for a temple compound. The Kyakuden, Reception Hall, is the site of Ushitora Gongyo, a daylight prayer service officiated by the High Priest or his proxy. The Ozagawari Joza Gohonzon (\\"Gohonzon of the Seat of the Dharma\\") is enshrined in the hall on the second floor of the Kyakuden, flanked by lifesize statues of Nichiren Daishonin (left) and Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin (right). =Mieid≈ç= The Image Hall A carving of a Fenghuang rooster on an Image Hall transom The Mieido (English: Image Hall Kanji: Âæ° ÂΩ± Â†Ç) traces its history to a building called the Mido (Mid≈ç: Âæ°Â†Ç) erected by Nikko Shonin when he founded Taisekiji in 1290. It takes its name from a lifesize image of Nichiren sculpted by Japanese Buddhist artisan Echizen H≈çky≈ç Kaikei, a carver of Buddhist images. This image was enshrined in the year 1388 in a building that was then replaced in 1522. The current, classical structure was erected in 1632 with donations from Ky≈çdai-in, wife of Hachisuka Yoshishige, Lord of the Tokushima Castle. Several rounds of expansions, improvements, and repairs have been undertaken since then, and it was designated a prefectural tangible cultural property by Shizuoka Prefecture after major repairs in 1971. The most recent overhaul was finished in November 2013. The seven-year project entailed completely breaking down and reassembling the building piece by piece. All the parts were cataloged, mapped, and their condition recorded. Damaged structural members were repaired or replaced, and decorative fixtures such as transom carvings and other artwork, were painstaking restored. When the building was reassembled, aseismic structural augmentation (dampers) was installed to protect it from earthquake damage. New gold leaf was applied to the indoor pillars, and all exposed surfaces were finished with vermilion using traditional methods.Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ Ny≈´mon (Êó•ËìÆÊ≠£ÂÆóÂÖ•ÈñÄ: \\"Introduction to Nichiren Shoshu\\"), p. 337.Taiseki-ji Information, Taisekiji, 1992; p. 17Êó•ËìÆÊ≠£ÂÆóÁ∑èÊú¨Â±±Âæ°ÂΩ±Â†Ç‚ÄïÂØõÊ∞∏„ÅÆÂÜçÂª∫„Åã„ÇâÂπ≥Êàê„ÅÆÂ§ßÊîπ‰øÆ„Åæ„Åß: \\"The Nichiren Shosho Head-temple Image Hall: From its Kan'ei-period reconstruction to its Heisei-period restoration\\", Dainichiren Publishing, 2016 (source for dates, name derivation, content of 2006‚Äì13 renovations) The building is known for its decorative transoms that depict various Buddhist deities that are believed to occupy the Treasure Tower of the Lotus Sutra. =H≈çand≈ç= The Enshrinement Hall, built in 2002, houses the Dai Gohonzon of the High Sanctuary of the Essential Teaching, the supreme object of worship in Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´. The H≈çand≈ç is built in the style of a Kura storehouse to signify that the Nichiren Shoshu faith has not yet taken hold as the primary religion of the world's people. Nichiren Shoshu claims that Nichiren willed that the Dai Gohonzon is not to be made publicly accessible, but rather stored away and only viewed by those who have asked for and been granted an audience by the High Priest, until such time. Another interpretation of this is that, as different from all other Nichiren Shoshu altars, the one in the H≈çand≈ç has neither offerings of evergreens nor drums, and non-believers are not permitted entry. Handicapped believers and their attendants are given priority entry and seating within the building. On the high altar, the Shumidan, of the H≈çand≈ç is a Buddhist Stupa containing the ashes of Nichiren Daishonin (left), an inner-altar housing the Dai Gohonzon (center), and another stupa containing a statue of Nichiren Daishonin carved by Izumi Ajari Nipp≈ç Sh≈çnin from the same camphorwood plank that the Dai Gohonzon was inscribed on; while pious tradition claims that Nichiren approvingly characterized the statue as an exact image of himself. Numerous relics from Taiseki-ji's 750-year history are kept in the Gohozo Treasure House. Taiseki-ji has traditionally regarded the Mieid≈ç (see above) as the temple's Hond≈ç (main hall), but only its provisional main hall until wide propagation is achieved, when the building housing the Dai Gohonzon would take over that role. The H≈çand≈ç replaced the Sh≈çhond≈ç (Ê≠£Êú¨Â†Ç: true main hall), after its demolition. (See below for details on demolished buildings) =Goh≈çz≈ç and H≈çanden= The (\\"Treasure House\\") houses various religious scrolls and paintings, and other religious and historical records, relics, and artifacts. It possesses the original Gosho documents of Nichiren conversing with the Buddhist deity Hachiman, as well as a personal letter given to Lord Nanjo Tokimitsu while he was alive. In addition, all Gohonzons transcribed by Nichiren Shoshu priests are stored within this building, which are mostly taken out in April for the Omushibarai Ceremony. In addition, it also features modest displays of cultural objects donated by pilgrims from countries where they have attracted converts. The H≈çanden (Â•â ÂÆâ ÊÆø) building, where the Dai Gohonzon was once enshrined, stands behind it. =Pagoda= The Taiseki-ji pagoda Completed in 1749 with the assistance of the Edo government, Taiseki- ji's pagoda was built with donations of 5,000 gold ry≈ç. It is five-storied and faces west rather than the usual south to signify that Nichiren's Buddhism would spread from the east (Japan) to the west; that is, back to the land of Sakyamuni Buddha and beyond to the rest of the world. It is the largest five- storied pagoda along the T≈çkaid≈ç, the historical main highway along Japan's eastern seaboard from Edo (today's Tokyo) to Kyoto. The pagoda was designated a national cultural treasure in year 1966 and a major restoration was completed in January 2017. Its doors are ceremoniously opened every February 16 to celebrate Nichiren's birthday. =Graves of early Soka Gakkai Presidents= * On the left rear of the Pagoda is the 1945 grave and Stupa of the first Soka Gakkai President Tsunesaburo Makiguchi. * The second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda is located at the left front of the pagoda. His ashes were moved from Jozai-ji temple (Toshima, Tokyo), and reinterred here in 2001. =Daik≈çd≈ç= The Daik≈çd≈ç (\\"English: Grand Auditorium\\") was donated by Soka Gakkai, with construction completed on 1 March 1958. It houses the ‚ÄúAbutsubo Gohonzon‚Äù (often wrongly mistaken for the \\"Mannenkugo Gohonzon\\" or \\"Dai-Honzon\\" ) inscribed by Nichiren for the enlightenment of women and bestowed to Sennichi, the pious wife of disciple Abutsubo. It is flanked by the ihai memorial tablets of second High Priest Nikk≈ç Shonin and his successor, third High Priest Nichimoku. It is in a dilapidated condition and scheduled for demolition and reconstruction after completion of the new Sanmon gate in 2021. The former highest lay leader of Hokkeko believers (Hokkeko Sokoto), J≈çsei Toda addressed youth adherents from this building on 16 March 1958.

Circa December 1979. The Sh≈çhond≈ç (Ê≠£ Êú¨ Â†Ç True Main Hall) was a building at Taiseki-ji, which opened in October 1972 and was subsequently demolished in 1998. Daisaku Ikeda, who emphasized the building of monuments to the success of the movement,Hashimoto, H., & McPherson, W. (1976). Rise and Decline of Sokagakkai Japan and the United States. Review of Religious Research, 17(2), 82-92. doi:10.2307/3510626 made the request to build the new structure which became the Shohondo. As explained by professor Daniel A. M√©traux, the Soka Gakkai placed particular importance on the building of the Shohondo, based on interpretations of doctrine not shared by the Nichiren Shoshu sect as a whole, and therefore controversy over its status arose at its construction. The Shohondo was inaugurated by the Soka Gakkai who claimed it as the \\"True High Sanctuary\\", Kaidan, which was a title disputed by conservative groups within the sect including the Myoshinko (now known as Kensh≈çkai) lay organisation, and the Nichiren Shoshu Priesthood. In Nichiren Shoshu doctrine that title was reserved for a future temple to be built at the base of Mt. Fuji on the completion of Kosen Rufu, when the Japanese nation would convert to Nichiren‚Äôs Buddhism. Professor M√©traux explains that the Soka Gakkai was reinterpreting doctrine and maintained that they could consider the Shohondo as the \\"True High Sanctuary\\", Kaidan, about which Nichiren wrote, because through the Soka Gakkai Nichiren‚Äôs philosophy was spread through Japan and was positively impacting people. The importance of the Shohondo was, therefore, a highly contentious matter dividing the Soka Gakkai and other factions within the faith. High Priest Nittatsu Hosoi, clarified that the Sh≈çhond≈ç was not the True High Sanctuary about which Nichiren wrote, though directed the Sh≈çhond≈ç as a temporary home for the Dai-Gohonzon, the permanent home of the Dai- Gohonzon would be the future True High Sanctuary. The \\"Eternal Flame\\" at the entrance of the now-demolished Sh≈çhond≈ç ‚Äì photo dated 3 November 1978 The construction of the Sh≈çhond≈ç was funded largely by donations from lay believers of Nichiren Shoshu. In 1968, approximately 8 million Soka Gakkai adherents contributed money to the construction. An estimated grand total of ¬•35,536,000,000 was raised: * ¬• 35,064,300,000.00 came from the S≈çka Gakkai lay organization. * ¬• 313,820,000.00 from the Hokkek≈ç lay organization * ¬• 157,870,000.00 from Nichiren Shoshu priests and their families.Corrigendum in Dai-Nichiren, July 1991. Published by Nichiren Shoshu. The building was demolished in 1998, the official reason given by Nichiren Shoshu for the demolition was the discovery of rust on the pillars within the temple. Engineers discovered that ocean sand had been used in the mortar of the building, risking the Dai Gohonzon's safety during an earthquake. The school also concedes that its demolition of the Sh≈çhond≈ç was an extension of the doctrinal dispute between it and S≈çka Gakkai, emphasizing the impiety of the organisation for deviating from its formal doctrines of orthodoxy.S≈çka Gakkai- in e no shakubuku ky≈çhon (Text for refuting Soka Gakkai's misrepresentations to its adherents), Taiseki-ji, 2004. pp. 330‚Äì331. American architects Richard Meier and Robert Arthur Stern both disparaged the demolition. Terence Riley, former chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York opined that the planned demolition would be a \\"regrettable finale\\" to a century that has \\"witnessed so much loss\\".

An approximate thirty-minute walk from the Head Temple is Myoren-ji, which is another former residence of Nanjo Tokimitsu, the person who donated the land of Taisekiji to Nikko Shonin. The temple's name derives from the Buddhist name (kaimy≈ç) Nanjo Tokimitsu's wife, My≈çren, whose historical birth name is unknown. This temple houses many historically significant artifacts, in particular, the Gohonzon enshrined in its main altar, which was inscribed by Nikko Shonin in the year 1315, and a small, decorative statue of Nichiren that is preserved as a historical remembrance. The temple is known for the unique format of its Oeshiki ceremony commemorating the death of Nichiren.

Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 138. . It is a story that presents the tragic consequences of a skipper's pride. On an ill-fated voyage in winter, he brings his daughter aboard ship for company. The skipper ignores the advice of one of his experienced men, who fears that a hurricane is approaching. When the storm arrives, the skipper ties his daughter to the mast to prevent her from being swept overboard. She calls out to her dying father as she hears the surf beating on the shore, then prays to Christ to calm the seas. The ship crashes onto the reef of Norman's Woe and sinks; the next morning a horrified fisherman finds the daughter's body, still tied to the mast and drifting in the surf. The poem ends with a prayer that all be spared such a fate \\"on the reef of Norman's Woe.\\" The poem was published in the New World, edited by Park Benjamin, which appeared on January 10, 1840. Longfellow was paid $25 for it, equivalent to $654 in 2015. Inspiration Longfellow combined fact and fiction to create this poem. His inspiration was the great blizzard of 1839, which ravaged the north-east coast of the United States for 12 hours starting January 6, 1839, destroying 20 ships with a loss of 40 lives. Fitzgerald, Donal, \\"The Night of the Big Wind,\\" Ice, Gales and Moving Bogs. Ballingeary Cumann Staire History Society Journal. The poem appears to combine two events. Longfellow probably drew for the specifics on the destruction of the Favorite, a ship from Wiscasset, Maine, on the reef of Norman's Woe off the coast of Gloucester, Massachusetts. All aboard were lost, one a woman, who reportedly floated to shore dead but still tied to the mast. North Shore Community College, \\"Norman's Woe (Gloucester Harbor) Location, History, and Legends,\\" Poetry of Places in Essex County, The name used in the poem is that of another vessel, lost near Boston. The poem is so well known that the loop road leading close to Norman‚Äôs Woe from Route 127 is named Hesperus Ave. In December 1839, Longfellow wrote in his diary about the writing of \\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\\": Adaptations \\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\\" was adapted into films of the same name in 1927 and 1948. Colloquial usage The title phrase is sometimes used colloquially to indicate a disheveled appearance. For example, in the film The Big Circus (1959), one character tells another: \\"I didn't bring the rain, and you're beginning to look like the wreck of the Hesperus\\". In the popular TV series ‚Äî Homeland (2011 - 2020), in Season 2 Episode 7, Chris Brody son of Nicholas Brody recalls his mother saying about his father's workshop as ‚Äî The Wreck of Hesperus to Mike Faber. Namesakes The poem has inspired titles in various media. It was the inspiration for a 1944 Mighty Mouse cartoon of the same name. Wreck of the Hesperus is the name of an Irish doom/drone metal band. The Pleasure Island amusement park in Wakefield, Massachusetts (1958‚Äì1970), 18 miles south-west of the site where the fictional Hesperus sank, featured a ride named \\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\\". The rock band Procol Harum included their song \\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\\" on their album A Salty Dog (1969). George Harrison included a song titled \\"Wreck of the Hesperus\\" on his 1987 album Cloud Nine. The English poet Roger McGough recited a one-minute version of the poem, complete with sound effects, on the album Miniatures produced by Morgan Fisher in 1980.

In physics, absolute space and time may be a preferred frame. Before Newton A version of the concept of absolute space (in the sense of a preferred frame) can be seen in Aristotelian physics.Absolute and Relational Theories of Space and Motion Robert S. Westman writes that a \\"whiff\\" of absolute space can be observed in Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, where Copernicus uses the concept of an immobile sphere of stars.Robert S. Westman, The Copernican Achievement, University of California Press, 1975, p. 45. Newton Originally introduced by Sir Isaac Newton in Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, the concepts of absolute time and space provided a theoretical foundation that facilitated Newtonian mechanics. According to Newton, absolute time and space respectively are independent aspects of objective reality:In Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica See the Principia on line at Andrew Motte Translation > Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature > flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is > called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and > external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of > motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ... According to Newton, absolute time exists independently of any perceiver and progresses at a consistent pace throughout the universe. Unlike relative time, Newton believed absolute time was imperceptible and could only be understood mathematically. According to Newton, humans are only capable of perceiving relative time, which is a measurement of perceivable objects in motion (like the Moon or Sun). From these movements, we infer the passage of time. These notions imply that absolute space and time do not depend upon physical events, but are a backdrop or stage setting within which physical phenomena occur. Thus, every object has an absolute state of motion relative to absolute space, so that an object must be either in a state of absolute rest, or moving at some absolute speed.Space and Time: Inertial Frames (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) To support his views, Newton provided some empirical examples: according to Newton, a solitary rotating sphere can be inferred to rotate about its axis relative to absolute space by observing the bulging of its equator, and a solitary pair of spheres tied by a rope can be inferred to be in absolute rotation about their center of gravity (barycenter) by observing the tension in the rope. Differing views Newton, or because they rotate relative to the universe itself according to Mach, or because they rotate relative to local geodesics according to general relativity. Historically, there have been differing views on the concept of absolute space and time. Gottfried Leibniz was of the opinion that space made no sense except as the relative location of bodies, and time made no sense except as the relative movement of bodies. George Berkeley suggested that, lacking any point of reference, a sphere in an otherwise empty universe could not be conceived to rotate, and a pair of spheres could be conceived to rotate relative to one another, but not to rotate about their center of gravity, an example later raised by Albert Einstein in his development of general relativity. A more recent form of these objections was made by Ernst Mach. Mach's principle proposes that mechanics is entirely about relative motion of bodies and, in particular, mass is an expression of such relative motion. So, for example, a single particle in a universe with no other bodies would have zero mass. According to Mach, Newton's examples simply illustrate relative rotation of spheres and the bulk of the universe.Ernst Mach; as quoted by > When, accordingly, we say that a body preserves unchanged its direction and > velocity in space, our assertion is nothing more or less than an abbreviated > reference to the entire universe. > --Ernst Mach; as quoted by Ciufolini and Wheeler: Gravitation and Inertia, > p. 387 These views opposing absolute space and time may be seen from a modern stance as an attempt to introduce operational definitions for space and time, a perspective made explicit in the special theory of relativity. Even within the context of Newtonian mechanics, the modern view is that absolute space is unnecessary. Instead, the notion of inertial frame of reference has taken precedence, that is, a preferred set of frames of reference that move uniformly with respect to one another. The laws of physics transform from one inertial frame to another according to Galilean relativity, leading to the following objections to absolute space, as outlined by Milutin Blagojeviƒá: > * The existence of absolute space contradicts the internal logic of > classical mechanics since, according to Galilean principle of relativity, > none of the inertial frames can be singled out. * Absolute space does not > explain inertial forces since they are related to acceleration with respect > to any one of the inertial frames. * Absolute space acts on physical objects > by inducing their resistance to acceleration but it cannot be acted upon. Newton himself recognized the role of inertial frames.Isaac Newton: Principia, Corollary V, p. 88 in Andrew Motte translation. See the Principia on line at Andrew Motte Translation > The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among > themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a > straight line. As a practical matter, inertial frames often are taken as frames moving uniformly with respect to the fixed stars. See Inertial frame of reference for more discussion on this. Special relativity The concepts of space and time were separate in physical theory prior to the advent of special relativity theory, which connected the two and showed both to be dependent upon the reference frame's motion. In Einstein's theories, the ideas of absolute time and space were superseded by the notion of spacetime in special relativity, and curved spacetime in general relativity. Absolute simultaneity refers to the concurrence of events in time at different locations in space in a manner agreed upon in all frames of reference. The theory of relativity does not have a concept of absolute time because there is a relativity of simultaneity. An event that is simultaneous with another event in one frame of reference may be in the past or future of that event in a different frame of reference, which negates absolute simultaneity. Einstein Quoted below from his later papers, Einstein identified the term aether with \\"properties of space\\", a terminology that is not widely used. Einstein stated that in general relativity the \\"aether\\" is not absolute anymore, as the geodesic and therefore the structure of spacetime depends on the presence of matter. General relativity Special relativity eliminates absolute time (although G√∂del and others suspect absolute time may be valid for some forms of general relativity) and general relativity further reduces the physical scope of absolute space and time through the concept of geodesics. There appears to be absolute space in relation to the distant stars because the local geodesics eventually channel information from these stars, but it is not necessary to invoke absolute space with respect to any system's physics, as its local geodesics are sufficient to describe its spacetime.

He was the son of Agostino Ansano Polidori (1714‚Äì1778), a physician and poet who lived and practised in his native Bientina, near Pisa, Tuscany. Polidori studied law at the University of Pisa. He became secretary to the tragedian Vittorio Alfieri in 1785 and remained with him four years. He came to England from Paris in 1790 after resigning as Alfieri's secretary. He settled in London, working as an Italian teacher and translator. He translated various literary works, notably, John Milton's Paradise Lost and Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, besides other writings of Milton and Lucan. He wrote prolifically, producing his own fiction, poetry, criticism, and tragedies. He also set up a private press at his home in London, where amongst other works (mostly his own), he printed the first editions of some poems by his grandchildren, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti. He also printed an edition of the poem Osteologia, which his father Agostino Ansano Polidori had written in 1763. He retired to a house in Holmer Green, Buckinghamshire in 1836.

It is the administrative and industrial centre of the homonymous Smolyan Province. The town is situated in the valley of the Cherna (\\"Black\\") and the Byala (\\"White\\") Rivers in the central Rhodopes at the foot of the mountains' highest part south of the popular ski resorts Pamporovo and Chepelare. As of February 2011, it has a population of 30,283 inhabitants. Name The name of the town comes from the local Slavic tribe of the Smolyani, the name of whom is probably cognate to the Slavic word smola (\\"resin\\"). History Salih Aga Pashmakli Residence According to archaeological evidence, the area around Smolyan was first settled in the 2nd-1st millennium BC. In the Middle Ages it acquired its name from the Slavic tribe, the Smolyani, who settled in the region in the 7th century. During the Middle Ages, it was ruled by the Part of the Byzantine and Bulgarian Empires. For a while during the 14th century it came under the control of the Bulgarian feudal lord Momchil, alongside the whole Rhodope mountains, before eventually being subjugated by the Ottoman Empire. Smolyan remained under Ottoman rule for five centuries, a township of the Ottoman Sanjak of G√ºm√ºlcine in the Adrianople Vilayet between 1867 and 1912. It was known in Ottoman Turkish as Pa≈ümaklƒ± or Ahi√ßelebi. The area was liberated by the 21st Sredna Gora Regiment led by Vladimir Serafimov in 1912, during the First Balkan War. The modern town of Smolyan was formed by the merger of three existing villages ‚Äî Ustovo, Raykovo and Ezerovo ‚Äî in 1960. Cathedral of Saint Vissarion (2006)  Population  The population of Smolyan just after World War II was about 5,000.‚Äûpop-stat.mashke.org‚Äú Since then, it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding smaller towns, reaching its peak in the beginning of the 1990s, exceeding 34,000. ‚ÄûWorldCityPopulation‚Äú =Ethnic linguistic and religious composition= According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows: Population on 01.02.2011 by provinces, municipalities, settlements and age; National Statistical InstitutePopulation by province, municipality, settlement and ethnic identification, by 01.02.2011; Bulgarian National Statistical Institute *Bulgarians: 25,045 (97.0%) *Roma: 258 (1.0%) *Turks: 153 (0.6%) *Others: 120 (0.5%) *Indefinable: 248 (1.0%) **Undeclared: 4,818 (15.7%) Total: 30,642 In Smolyan Municipality 32708 declared as Bulgarians, 301 as Roma and 170 as Turks and 9,000 did not declare their ethnic group.

It is a specific language impairment characterized by an ability to use expressive spoken language that is markedly below the appropriate level for the mental age, but with a language comprehension that is within normal limits. There can be problems with vocabulary, producing complex sentences, and remembering words, and there may or may not be abnormalities in articulation. As well as present speech production, very often, someone will have difficulty remembering things. This memory problem is only disturbing for speech; non-verbal or non-linguistically based memory will be unimpaired. An example of a child with expressive language disorder can be seen here. Expressive language disorder affects work and schooling in many ways. It is usually treated by specific speech therapy, and usually cannot be expected to go away on its own. Expressive language disorder can be further classified into two groups: developmental expressive language disorder and acquired expressive language disorder. Developmental expressive language disorder currently has no known cause, is first observed when a child is learning to talk, is more common in boys than girls, and is much more common than the acquired form of the disorder. Acquired expressive language disorder is caused by specific damage to the brain by a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or seizures. Care must be taken to distinguish expressive language disorder from other communication disorders, sensory-motor disturbances, intellectual disability and/or environmental deprivation (see DSM-IV-TR criterion D). These factors affect a person's speech and writing to certain predictable extents, and with certain differences. Careful diagnosis is also important because \\"atypical language development can be a secondary characteristic of other physical and developmental problems that may first manifest as language problems\\". Models of language production Willem Levelt outlined the currently accepted theory of speech production. Words are produced after the concept waiting to be produced is conceptualized, related words are selected, encoded and the sound waves of speech are produced. Association with language networks There is also a lot of debate about whether specific language impairments, such as expressive language disorder, are caused by deficits in grammar or by a deficit in processing language information. However, an alternative hypothesis to the cause of SLIs has been posited, called the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis. The Procedural Deficit Hypothesis opines that we can explain language impairments due to abnormal development of brain structures that are involved in procedural memory, our memories that remember how to perform different cognitive and motor tasks. The procedural memory system is associated with basal-ganglia circuits in the frontal lobe and further investigation of this particular hypothesis could aid in the development of a clinical neurological picture of what the underlying causes of SLI are. Scientific studies of speech and language Some of the earliest neuroscientific discoveries were related to the discovery that damage to certain areas of the brain related to impairments in language, such as the discovery of Wernicke's area and Broca's area. Lesions in these parts of the brain impair language comprehension and language production, respectively. Paul Broca was the first to note that the left hemisphere of the brain appeared to be localized for language function, particularly for right handed patients. Modern neuroscientific research has verified this, though language may be lateralizaed to the right hemisphere in some right-handed individuals. =Developmental verbal dyspraxia= In 1990, it was reported that the several generations of the KE family suffered from developmental verbal dyspraxia and orofacial praxis that were inherited in a typical autosomal dominant pattern. Further analysis traced this inheritance pattern back to mutations in the FOXP2 genes. These studies have allowed scientists to begin to investigate how changes to one gene can alter human communication. FOXP2 is the first gene that has been identified that is specifically linked to speech and language production. Mutant alleles of the normal FOXP2 gene have been found to be the cause of severe speech impairments. =Specific language impairment= Neuroimaging techniques, such as structural and functional MRI, found no significant differences between individuals with SLI and normal controls. However, more subtle and sophisticated techniques, such as voxel-based morphometry studies have allowed researchers to identify bilateral abnormalities in neural volume in areas of the brain associated with motor functions, such as the caudate nucleus, in the affected members of the KE family when compared to the unaffected family members. This volume reduction showed a high correlation between reduced volume and tests of oral praxis, supporting the idea that odd development of the caudate nucleus is related to the problems in motor control observed in the KE family. Due to the vague nature of the diagnosis of expressive language disorder, there is little specific scientific research that we can currently locate. A larger body of research exists around neuroscientific studies with children diagnosed with a specific language impairment (SLI). fMRI studies have shown that children with SLI have a significantly smaller left hemispheric pars triangularis (Broca's area) and asymmetry of dominance of language structures, as opposed to the more typical left hemisphere dominance. Scientists are beginning to elucidate differences in activation patterns in children with SLIs using neuroimaging techniques to capture brain activity while performing different cognitive tasks. A major observation is lack of left hemisphere lateralization in major language structures such as the inferior frontal gyrus-opercularis, inferior frontal gyrus-triangularis, supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. The same study reported hypoactivation and hyper activation of other brain regions - the supramarginal junction and anterior insula, respectively. Other in-depth imaging studies report finding previously undiagnosed lesions in the brains of children with well-characterized developmental language development. Together, these findings strongly suggest that language impairments are the result of an underlying neurological defect in an area of the brain related to language. Studies looking at long-term outcomes for individuals with specific language impairments such as expressive language disorder track these individuals from childhood to adulthood. As Whitehouse and his colleagues suggest, \\"When childhood language problems persist into adulthood, they can have far reaching consequences in terms of academic, social and vocational outcomes.\\" These researchers found that children diagnosed with an SLI would have persistent problems with language and are more likely to pursue vocational training rather than university, thereby avoiding professions requiring high levels of literacy. A lower socioeconomic status was also noted by adults who were diagnosed with an SLI as a child. Whitehouse also reported that these adults had more difficulties in establishing friendships, most likely due to a decreased ability to express themselves socially. Current educational interventions for students with an SLI Specific language impairments are often secondary characteristics of other disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In these cases, issues with speech and language are often not treated specifically, but rather attention is given to the primary complaint. Due to the high correlation of an SLI with other disorders, it is difficult to tell the difference between \\"pure SLI\\" or language impairments due to the presence of another disorder. The focus and attention on the need for effective literacy instruction in the current educational climate is large. It is widely recognized that literacy needs to be taught across all curricula and verbal fluency correlates positively academic achievement. Literacy strategies are now being taught in an inclusive manner, rather than the traditional pull-out system, it is assumed that successful teaching strategies for high needs students are good for all students. Basic principles for interventions for students with a specific language impairment follow - the necessity to set specific goals, to manipulate the classroom environment and curricula so that there are many opportunities to use grammar effectively, the importance of consistently modelling high quality speech, the use of a wide variety of text and literature, and to value comprehension as the most important goal for students to achieve. There is no current cure-all intervention for students with SLIs, however, this is an ever expanding field of research. Special education coding Students diagnosed with an expressive language disability usually qualify for extra educational supports and assistance in school. =In Alberta schools= An expressive language disability or delay in kindergarten age children is classified as a Communication Disability/Delay under a Code 30. If there is no marked improvement in the child's ability to express themselves verbally once the student enters Grade 1, a child can be given a Code 57 for a Communication Disability. This diagnosis must be given from a Speech-Language Pathologist in order for the child to receive continued special education funding.Alberta Education Special Education Coding Criteria 2011/2012.

Fictional character biography =Valiant Entertainment version= Born into battle, Aric of Dacia, heir to the throne of the Visigoth people, never knew peace. Raised under the oppressive thumb of the Roman Empire in 5th century Europe, his entire life was a never-ending series of campaigns against Rome, until a far more terrifying enemy came into play: the brutal race and alien colonizers known as the Vine. Abducted during a midnight scouting raid and taken to the far reaches of space, Aric and his fellow Visigoth captives lived their lives as slaves to the Vine, with no hope of escape. After several years of captivity aboard a Vine colony ship, Aric led a revolt against his alien captors, storming the hallowed temple of the Vine and stealing their most powerful relic, Shanhara, the sentient X-O Manowar armor. Aric bonded with the armor‚Äîthe first being in living memory to survive the process‚Äîand turned the Vine's most powerful weapon against them. But a crushing counterattack by the Vine left many of Aric's allies dead or dying. Inexperienced with the armor himself, Aric barely escaped the Vine fleet before rocketing back to Earth. Upon his return, Aric learned that due to the effects of time dilation, 1,600 years have passed since his abduction and he was now stranded in the 21st century. Distraught by the loss of his family and people, Aric secluded himself in the Peruvian jungle, but the Vine were unwilling to leave their most sacred relic in human hands. Vine legend told that their greatest champion would one day wear the armor; news of a human controlling the suit could spell massive civil unrest for their empire. To recover it, covert Vine agents called \\"plantings\\", left on Earth hundreds of years ago and modified to appear human, recruited the super-spy Ninjak to kill Aric and return the armor. But with the help of Alexander Dorian, Aric turned Ninjak against his alien masters and led an attack on the Vine's secret headquarters inside Britain's MI-6, virtually eliminating the plantings' operations in England. The Vine responded with a full-force invasion, one that proved to be no match for the X-O Manowar armor. However, Aric realized that there would be no peace with the Vine until they were destroyed. Commandeering a Vine ship, Aric mounted a one-man invasion of the alien race's homeworld, Loam, toppling the empire and freeing thousands in the process, including a population of enslaved Visigoths descended from Aric's own people. Returning to Earth with his new kinsmen in tow, Aric decided to reestablish an ancestral Visigoth homeland in its present-day location within Romania, a decision that quickly drew the ire of the neighboring Russian government. After warding off a series of coordinated military strikes, Aric was faced with his greatest threat yet, the super-team known as Unity. Aric's defense of Dacia did not go to plan. He was beaten by Toyo Harada, stripped of his armor, and taken into custody by the United States Military Reconnaissance Outpost (M.E.R.O.), a covert government agency that monitors and engages alien threats. In exchange for asylum for him and his people, Aric, now reunited with the X-O Manowar armor, works as an agent of M.E.R.O., protecting American interests on and above the Earth. =Characters= Shanhara (X-O Manowar Armor) According to legend, the sentient X-O Manowar armor known as Shanhara grew from a secret plant eons ago on the alien empire's home world of Loa. During the Vine's persecution at the hands of a mysterious race known as the Torment, it bonded with its first Vine Host, who went on to use its might to single- handedly repel the invasion force and win freedom for his people. The armor is living, composed of organics and exotic metals‚Äîa mutualistic symbiote, bonded to its host. For centuries, the Vine high priests searched for a wearer that could bear the power of Shanhara, but all such candidates were killed in the process. When Aric of Dacia attempted to escape the Vine captivity, he bonded with Shanhara as a last resort and was deemed worthy. Aric and Shanhara share a unique relationship‚Äîone that continues even when they are separated. Shanhara can translate foreign and alien languages, tap into a world's historical and geographical records, interface with complex forms of technology, and even heal life-threatening injuries and illnesses. Even though the bond between Aric and the armor is strong, it can be severed. Recently, the Harbinger Foundation teletechnopath Livewire was able to override the armor's connection to Aric and wear Shanhara for a limited period. Despite its impact on earthly affairs, the armor's true origin and purpose remain a mystery‚Äîone that the beings known as the Armor Hunters will soon expose. =Original version= Aric of Dacia was a Visigoth born in the 5th century AD under Roman rule. As a young boy, Aric witnessed the slaughter of his parents at the hands of Roman soldiers. Henceforth, he dedicated himself to destroying the Roman oppressors, with the help of his Uncle, Alaric I. Some years later, Aric took a Celtic slave, Deidre, to be his consort. He grew to love her, and worshipped her god, Lugh. One evening, he saw demons attacking members of his tribe. Aric attacked them, but was quickly subdued and taken aboard their alien spacecraft. For the next seven years, Aric was held prisoner in the slave pens of the spacecraft. At a refuelling station several light years from Earth, he befriended a man known as the \\"Map Giver,\\" who looked similar to Elvis Presley. The \\"Map Giver\\" used a discarded bone shard to carve a map into Aric's palm that would lead him to the alien's armory. Aric fought his way to the X-O Manowar class armor and donned the control ring. It later became clear that the \\"manufacturing\\" process of the X-O Manowar armor, which not only self-repaired, but also reproduced, involved the absorption of a sentient intelligence that then became the armor's own sentience. With this living armor he was able to escape from the alien ship and return to Earth. Writer Robert Venditti signing copies of Valiant Entertainment's debut issue of the series at a May 2, 2012 signing at Midtown Comics in Manhattan Due to time dilation, as Aric had been traveling at the speed of light, although only a few years had passed on board, sixteen centuries had passed on Earth. Aric thus found himself in the unfamiliar world of the 20th century. At first, Aric struggled to adjust to late-20th-century Earth. He encountered a number of Valiant Universe heroes, befriending some and alienating others. He eventually gained control of Orb Industries, a multi-national corporation formerly controlled by the Spider Aliens. X-O Manowar played a major role in Valiant's successful Unity crossover event. In this storyline, Aric chose not to help the other Valiant heroes defeat Mothergod (Erica Pierce), and instead built a small empire in the \\"lost land.\\" Eventually, he was tricked by Mothergod and his people were slaughtered. Aric was eviscerated by a cyborg-tyrannosaurus and became trapped within the X-O Manowar armor for ten years to heal. Aric and the X-O Manowar armor were sent back to Aric's own time by Solar at the end of Unity. Aric tried to convince his uncle, Alaric, to help him destroy the Romans. However, Alaric was concerned about the power that Aric had gained through the armor. Alaric and the Romans joined forces to fight Aric, but failed to defeat him. In issue #28, the X-O Manowar armor (known as Shanhara) was destroyed. Solar went to Saturn to recover the armor left there, after defeating the alien he battled in Solar #7. This armor chose to remain with its deceased wearer, but had sprouted a seed, which Solar took. These seeds could be used to create a new Manowar armor, but only through the sacrifice of a sentient being. Aric's friend, Paul Bouvier, who was dying from spider alien poison, consented to be sacrificed so that Aric could continue his battles with the Spider Aliens. In the X-O Manowar Yearbook, it was explained how Gilad Anni-Padda, the Eternal Warrior, earned the eternal enmity of Aric. Gilad was rescued from bandits by Aric, but he betrayed the location of Aric's Visigoth camp to Roman soldiers, whose attack led Deidre to miscarry Aric's child. However, Gilad had betrayed the Visigoths as part of a conspiracy that led to the downfall of the Roman Empire and the rise of Alaric. =Acclaim Comics version= When Acclaim Entertainment acquired the comic series, X-O Manowar was significantly altered. The character was now a modern-day scientist named Donovan Wylie who wielded X-O armor, an ancient artifact owned by the United States government, having been captured from Nazi Germany in World War II. In this series, the X-O Manowar armor is an artifact of unknown origin that has been worn by a myriad of warriors throughout history. It essentially gives its wearer indefinite power; however, the armor slowly siphons the life essence of its wearer, damaging their mind and body. The armor attaches itself to the wearer's nervous system and cannot be removed without killing the person wearing it. It can, however, be changed to its \\"metal\\" form at the wearer's will, but the metal is permanently grafted onto the wearer's chest (it is unknown if the armor will activate if grafted onto another part of the body.) In other media =Film= In September 2016, newly formed Valiant Entertainment announced a feature film centered around Aric of Dacia / X-O Manowar. Executives of the company stated that there were notable directors attached to the project, and that the film will be true to the source material.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owd5Ep75VLE By April of 2020, John Cena teased his involvement with the film via his social media platforms.https://www.instagram.com/p/B-uEBeul6OQ/?utm_source=ig_embed =Video game= X-O Manowar was featured along with Marvel Comics' armored superhero Iron Man in the Acclaim Entertainment-developed video game Iron Man and X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal, produced for PC, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Sega Game Gear, and Game Boy.

Although a castle has stood here since the 15th century, the present building is of mainly 17th-century origin, with 19th-century extensions. The castle is a Category A listed building and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. History A castle is first recorded on the rocky peninsula at Dunbeath in 1428, when the lands belonged to the Earl of Caithness. The first recorded laird was Alexander Sutherland. It later became the property of the Clan Sinclair through the marriage of the daughter of Alexander Sutherland to William Sinclair (1410‚Äì1484), the first Sinclair Earl of Caithness. The Sinclairs replaced the earlier structure with a four-storey tower house in 1620. In March 1650, Dunbeath was attacked by the Royalist forces of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Sir John Sinclair rode to Edinburgh to warn of Montrose's arrival, leaving his wife to defend Dunbeath against Sir John Hurry. She soon surrendered, and a Royalist garrison was installed. Montrose was defeated in April at the Battle of Carbisdale, and the opposition forces, under David Leslie, recaptured the castle. The castle was extensively remodelled in the 17th century by Sir William Sinclair, and again in 1853 and 1881, when David Bryce was the architect.< From 1894 to 1945, the castle was owned by Vice-Admiral Sir Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair. In that year, after 325 years of occupation by the Sinclair Family, the castle was sold to Bertram Currie. In 1967 it was sold again to Harry Blythe and Helen (Sinclaire) Blythe. The castle remained in their possession until 1976 when it was sold to Ray Stanton Avery. In 1997 the castle was sold to the current owner, Stuart Wyndham Murray-Threipland. The castle remains a private residence today and is not open to the public. The castle The oldest part of the castle lies at the south-west corner, and dates largely from the 17th century. More modern additions have been made to the north and east, in a Scots Baronial style to match the earlier building. The interiors are much altered. The defensive site was enhanced by a dry ditch on the landward side, which cuts across the narrow promontory on which the castle stands.

Origins  The Ballot brothers, √âdouard and Maurice, founded their company at the Boulevard Brune in south-central Paris in 1905. √âdouard Ballot was a former naval officer, which explains the \\"anchor\\" that featured in the badges on the cars. Before World War I the factory concentrated on marine and industrial engines, and from 1910 or 1911 they were also offering automobile engines. The company was re-founded as Etablissements Ballot SA in 1910.  Sporting successes  Ballot RH3 Berline (1930), Cit√© de l'Automobile, Mulhouse, France There is little sign that Edouard Ballot himself took much interest in automobiles until December 1918. That was the month in which he had a significant conversation with Ren√© Thomas, a leading racing driver who had won the 1914 Indianapolis 500 race driving a Delage. Ballot was persuaded to build four 4.8-litre cars that would carry the \\"Ballot\\" name and compete in the forthcoming Indianapolis 500 race, scheduled for 30 May 1919. Time seemed very short, but Ballot lost no time, notably recruiting the Swiss born engineer Ernest Henry who had already worked on preparing Peugeot cars for their successful participation in the 1914 Indianapolis 500 race. Ballot's cars competed in the 1919 race, two of them finishing in 4th and 11th places. Ballot was sufficiently encouraged to return the next year, and in the 1920 Indianapolis 500 race a Ballot driven by Ren√© Thomas finished in second place: Ballots also took fifth and seventh places. A Ballot vehicle driven by Ren√© Thomas also finished second in the 1919 Targa Florio. More successes followed, on both sides of the Atlantic. Ralph DePalma, an American national champion and winner of the 1915 Indianapolis 500, finished second in the 1921 French Grand Prix and French driver Jules Goux finished third. Goux went on to win the inaugural Italian Grand Prix at Brescia, Italy in 1921, driving a Ballot. Second place was taken by the team leader Jean Chassagne on a sister car; a year before, in 1920 Chassagne made the fastest BARC lap of the year at Brooklands on a 4.9-litre Ballot, coming again second. A Ballot with a straight-eight-cylinder 4.9-litre engine competed in the 1921 French Grand Prix.  Road cars  As well as racing engines, the company made a range of road engines which were fitted to their own production cars. The first of Ballot's own road cars was the 1921 2-litre Ballot 2-litre sports tourer. In 1923 the Ballot 2 LT and a sport version, Ballot 2 LTS followed. By the time of the 19th Paris Motor Show in October 1924, Ballot was established in the market place as a producer of expensive road going cars with spectacular performance. The 2-litre sports tourer again appeared on the manufacturer's stand at the show. The car still used a four cylinder overhead camshaft 1,994 cc engine, and it sat on a wheelbase. It was priced, in bare chassis form, at 33,000 francs: Ballot also listed a \\"Torpedo\\" bodied version at 46,000 francs. From 1927, eight-cylinder engines were used.  Final chapter  Share of the √âtablissements Ballot SA, issued 1925 In 1931 the company was taken over by Hispano-Suiza. Swift decline followed: the last model was practically a Hispano-Suiza, and only the chassis was provided by Ballot. Ballot closed down in 1932.

fertile sub-Balkan mountain valley of Karlovo (which is the western part of the famous Rose Valley), immediately below the steep southern slopes of the Troyan Balkan Mountain (Central Stara Planina). Sopot is part of Plovdiv Province and is the administrative centre of a municipality.  Geography  It lies 2 km west of Karlovo, 136 km east of Sofia, 63 km north of Plovdiv and 61 km south of Troyan. It is the birthplace of arguably the best known and most renowned Bulgarian novelist, Ivan Vazov. Sopot is also a machine building centre.  History  According to Konstantin Jireƒçek, the toponym is of Proto-Slavic origin, as indicated by the large number of identical placenames all around the Slavic world. There is information about the locality dating back to the Ottoman rule. During the Bulgarian National Revival (18th and 19th centuries) it was called \\"Golden Sopot\\" because of its flourishing development in the crafts and trade. The citizens of Sopot manufactured homespun, braids, fur and leather of high quality and traded predominantly round the Ottoman Empire. During the struggle for liberation in 1877 the town was largely destroyed by fire and its population was slaughtered or expelled. The town was named Vazovgrad between 1950 and 1965 after which it obtained its present name again. The pioneering Bulgarian educator Nedelya Petkova (1826‚Äì1894) began her career a student at the monastery school of the \\"Holy presentation of the Blessed Virgin\\" convent in Sopot.  Population  The population is almost exclusively Christian, mostly Eastern Orthodox but with some Evangelical and Roman Catholic families. According to the 2011 census, 7,973 out of 8,754 inhabitants declared their ethnicity. Around 96.2% of those, or 7,669 people, are ethnic Bulgarians. There are 145 Roma people (1.8%) and 20 ethnic Turks (0.3%) living in the town of Sopot.  Religion  The population of Sopot professes mostly Eastern Orthodox Christianity. There are several families Roman Catholics and evangelicals. No Muslims . Sopot Monastery * Sopot monastery \\"St. Spas\\" or Sopot monastery for men \\"Vaznesenie Gospodne\\" (Ascension Day)(in its present form since 1879 ), in which on 7 December 1858 Vasil Levski became a monk. ‚Äì The exact date of the occurrence of the monastery is not known. It is believed that was founded in the 13th century. Most likely \\"St. Spas\\" is the successor of the previous monastery in the Sopot area ‚Äì \\"St. Trinity\\", extinct about the 11th or 12th century. The \\"St. Spas\\" monastery was \\"royal\\"- i.e. it was endowed with rights and property by Smilets of Bulgaria himself. These certificates were kept in the monastery until 1870. After that they were transmitted to Nayden Gerov for publishing. During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria the church was burned and destroyed many times. After its restoration in 1870 it was painted by the artist George Danchev, a close friend of Vasil Levski. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78), the church was destroyed again as only the altar survived, but the eyes of the saints were gouged by the bayonets of the Turks. The Church and the fountain of the monastery were restored again in 1879 by Abbot Raphail, whose grave is now behind the altar. By the south wall the church can be seen the great bell, cast in Craiova in 1873 and donated to the monastery by Sopot citizens living in Romania.http://www.bulgarianmonastery.com/bg/sopot_monastery.html * Nunnery \\"Vavedenie Bogorodichno\\" (Blessed Virgin),dating from 1665 ‚Äì one of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria of the Bulgarian Tourist Union.‚Ññ43. –≥—Ä. –°–æ–ø–æ—Ç ‚Äì –ñ–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –º–µ—Ç–æ—Ö ‚Äì The monastery church \\"Blessed Virgin\\" was built in the 15th century on the site of an old chapel.

On the first floor of the monastery was located the cell of the Abbess ‚Äì Hristina. Her cell was the entrance to Vasil Levski's hideout. In 1877 the monastery and the town were burnt down and the Abbess was brutally slaughtered by the Turks. From the monastery survived the temple, the hiding place of Vasil Levski, the fountain (1852), part of the cells and the old vine, which is considered to be one of the oldest in Bulgaria and is over 350 years old.

In 1920, the eve of the anniversary celebrations to commemorate the 70th anniversary and 50 years of literary activity of Vazov, among the poet's friends in Sofia started the idea to restore his native home. The construction of the house began in 1931. The interior was designed under the leadership of Stefan Kostov ‚Äì the Director of the Ethnographic Museum in Sofia. It was based on information from the Vazov brothers and Vala-Vazova Fetvadzhieva. On 6 June 1935 the house was officially opened as a museum. In 1964, the house-museum \\"Ivan Vazov\\" in Sopot was declared a cultural monument with national importance. On the occasion of 120th birth anniversary of the poet, on 8 July 1970 opened the exposure to the life and creative time in his home, built next to the house building. The rich fund, which has the house-museum \\"Ivan Vazov\\", recalls the most important periods in the life of the writer: his childhood in Sopot, where he completed his education, his work as assistant teacher in Kalofer with Botyo Petkov and teaching in the Diocese school in Plovdiv with Yoakim Gruev. The exhibited manuscripts present his rich literary works created in 1876‚Äì1877, when he was a refugee in Romania and published his first poetry works.http://www.paylessbg.com/en/articles/House-museum-Ivan-Vazov/371/ * Sopot Craft‚Äôs center \\"Esnaf\\" (founded in 2005) The ethnographic and craft center \\"Sopot's Esnaf\\" is located in two Bulgarian Renaissance houses ‚Äì \\"Budinata House\\" and House \\"Zagubanski\\" in the center of the city, where the descendants of the old masters demonstrate and share their experience. It is managed by the \\"Ivan Vazov\\" museum and the Association of the Sopot's masters and connoisseurs of arts and crafts. Visitors can review 4 thematic ethnographic collections, and observe the work of the local artisans ‚Äì engraving, incrustation, weaving and more. Particularly original is the arrangement the living room in the urban style from the late 19th century. In the center of the esnaf there is a cozy shop for traditional crafts from the Sopot School. On the second floor there is an equipped workshop for young people who are interested to learn old crafts.

The WRU is responsible for the running of rugby in Wales, overseeing 320 member clubs, the Welsh national team and National Leagues and Cups. The WRU is headed by the President (Gerald Davies), chairman (Gareth Davies) and CEO Martyn Phillips History Castle Hotel, Neath, where the WRU was founded. The roots of the Welsh Rugby Union lay in the creation of the South Wales Football Club in September 1875; formed, \\"...with the intention of playing matches with the principal clubs in the West of England and the neighbourhood. The rugby rules will be the code adopted.\\"Smith (1980), pg 31 The South Wales Football Club was superseded in 1878 by the South Wales Football Union in an attempt to bring greater regulation to the sport and to select representatives from club sides to represent the international game. The SWFU though were poorly organised, and although they arranged fixtures between a South Wales team and various English clubs, they were often victims of fixture-clashes and were accused of lacking energy. In 1880, Richard Mullock, secretary of the Newport Athletic Club, decided to take matters into his own hands and without the backing of the SWFU organised an international match against England. The match took place on 19 February 1881, and was won by England seven goals, one dropped goal and six tries to nil. This heavy defeat lay the seeds for further reforms that would lead to the creation of the WRU.Smith (1980), pg 34‚Äì40. There is confusion regarding the official date of creation of the Welsh Rugby Union. In March 1880 nine teams supposedly met at the Tenby Hotel, Swansea with the intent of creating a new union. These teams are thought to have been, Cardiff RFC, Chepstow RFC, Haverfordwest RFC, Llandaff RFC, Llanelli RFC, Neath RFC, Newport RFC, Pontypridd RFC and Swansea RFC. The issue with accepting this meeting is that there is no written evidence, just oral repetition.Smith (1980), pg 37. On 12 March 1881, eleven clubs met in the Castle Hotel, Neath to form what would be accepted as a Welsh rugby union. After a humiliating defeat in the first Wales international rugby game, the Neath meeting was organised by Mullock to form a union that could organise regular international matches. The founding clubs of the WFU (Welsh Football Union), as it was originally known, were Swansea C & FC, Pontypool RFC, Newport RFC, Merthyr RFC, Llanelli RFC, Bangor RFC, Brecon RFC, Cardiff RFC, Lampeter RFC, Llandovery RFC and Llandeilo RFC.Smith (1980), pg 41. Strangely the oldest rugby club in Wales, Neath RFC are not recorded as being present, even though the meeting took place in the town of Neath. It is unknown if this was an oversight by the committee to record the presence of the club, or if Neath RFC actually did not attend. The fact that two of the main committee members of the SWFU, John Llewellyn and Sam Clark were Neath men, and the creation of the WFU disbanded their union, is generally accepted as the reason for the absence of a Neath representative.Smith (1980), pg 42‚Äì43. The WRU was a founding member of the International Rugby Football Board, now known as World Rugby, in 1886 with Scotland and Ireland, with Mullock and Horace Lyne the Welsh representatives at the formal signing of the union in 1887. It was not until 1934 that the name, the Welsh Rugby Union, was adopted.Smith (1980), pg 45. Responsibilities Exterior of the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, where the Wales national team play all their home games The WRU are responsible for the running of Welsh rugby, including 320 member clubs, the Welsh national team and National Leagues and Cups. The Welsh Rugby Union has a major role in the development of coaches, referees and players throughout all ages for both men and women. They also own the home of Welsh rugby union, the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, \\"an icon of the modern Wales\\". After the national team the next highest level of representation in Wales is the four regions based around top club sides, but representing a larger area. These regions came into being in 2003 when the WRU elected to reduce the current top tier of Welsh professional rugby union from nine clubs into five regions modelled on the successful Irish provinces and the Super Rugby franchises in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The WRU had hoped to reduce the teams to four regions but Cardiff and Llanelli successfully argued for stand-alone status. After one year the Celtic Warriors region was closed down and the four surviving regional clubs are Cardiff Blues, Scarlets, Ospreys and Newport Gwent Dragons. They play in the Pro14, European Professional Club Rugby (Champions Cup and Challenge Cup) and Anglo- Welsh Cup competitions. Each region may call up players from a set of club teams within their area. These top club sides play in the 14-strong Welsh Premier Division. In August 2008 WRU chief Roger Lewis confirmed that the body was looking at a proposal to reinstate a fifth Welsh region, based in North Wales. Lewis admitted that he regretted the decision in 2004 to close down Celtic Warriors.http://www.worldcupweb.com/rugby/news/viewarticle.asp?id=15009 In September 2008 a new North Wales Rugby development team was announced, likely to be based in Wrexham; ultimately, the team was launched as RGC 1404, and was to be based in Colwyn Bay instead of Wrexham. In the same month Llanelli Scarlets changed their name to simply Scarlets, believing the new name would better represent their region beyond Llanelli.

Rugby Services Agreement The current Rugby Services Agreement (or RSA) has been in place since 28 August 2014, and will be in place between the union and the four Welsh regions (Cardiff Blues, Newport Gwent Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets) for six years.WRU and RRW sign six year deal The RSA delivers ¬£8.7million a year to the Regions guaranteed to be spent on Welsh qualified players with a complex matrix of funding, also guaranteeing a further ¬£3.6million in loan facilities from the WRU repayable during the term of the RSA. Each Region also receives a one-off ¬£500,000 payment on signature of the new RSA. The new agreement also allows players to be offered a National Dual Contract (NDC), which means the union will pay 60% of a NDC player's salary and their region 40%. They also become available for all Welsh senior matches, despite if the match falls outside World Rugby's international release windows in June and November. The WRU retained the right to play up to 13 senior international games each year with a 13-day release facility for squad training before the Six Nations and Autumn series games. The new agreement does state that the national team head coach, currently Wayne Pivac, will be the sole person to decide who gets a National Dual Contract, with a long-term aim of only selecting players based in Wales. The limit on foreign players in Regional squads has been capped at a maximum of six while each Region will be allowed two so-called time serving players who will be available for Welsh selection after three years residency (rising to five years, effective from 31 December 2020). Union's Patron The union's patron is Prince William Criticism In 2008 the Welsh Language Society wrote to the WRU outlining a \\"lack of commitment to the Welsh language\\" and later held meetings to discuss the matter. In a statement to BBC Wales, a WRU spokesman said that it was reviewing its website and would be having more Welsh on the site.

He is a saint of the Roman Catholic (canonized in 1052) and Eastern Orthodox churches. He is regarded as one of the three great German saints of the 10th century, the other two being Saint Ulrich and Saint Conrad of Constance. Towards the end of his life Wolfgang withdrew as a hermit to a solitary spot, in the Salzkammergut region of Upper Austria. Soon after Wolfgang's death many churches chose him as their patron saint, and various towns were named after him. Early life Wolfgang was descended from the family of the Swabian Counts of Pfullingen (Mon. Germ. His.: Script., X, 53). When seven years old, he had an ecclesiastic as a tutor at home; later he attended the celebrated monastic school at Reichenau Abbey.Foley OFM, Leonard. \\"St. Wolfgang of Regensburg\\", Saint of the Day, (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media Here he formed a strong friendship with Henry of Babenberg, brother of Bishop Poppo of W√ºrzburg, whom he followed to W√ºrzburg in order to attend the lectures of the noted Italian grammarian, Stephen of Novara, at the cathedral school. After Henry was made Archbishop of Trier in 956, he summoned Wolfgang, who became a teacher in the cathedral school of Trier, and also labored for the reform of the archdiocese, despite the hostility with which his efforts were met. Wolfgang's residence at Trier greatly influenced his monastic and ascetic tendencies, as here he came into contact with the great reform monastery of the 10th century, St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier, where he made the acquaintance of Saint Romuald, the teacher of Saint Adalbert of Prague. After the death of Archbishop Henry of Trier in 964, Wolfgang entered the Benedictine order in the Abbey of Maria Einsiedeln, Switzerland, and was ordained priest by Saint Ulrich in 968. Mission to the Magyars After their defeat in the Battle of the Lechfeld (955), the heathen Hungarians settled in ancient Pannonia. As long as they were not converted to Christianity they remained a constant menace to the empire. At the request of Ulrich, who clearly saw the danger, and at the desire of the Emperor Otto the Great, Wolfgang, according to the abbey annals, was \\"sent to the Hungarians\\" as the most suitable man to evangelize them. He was followed by other missionaries sent by Piligrim, Bishop of Passau, under whose jurisdiction the new missionary region came. Bishop of Regensburg Saint Wolfgang altar painting, c.1490 After the death of Bishop Michael of Regensburg (September 23, 972) Bishop Piligrim obtained from the emperor the appointment of Wolfgang as the new bishop (Christmas, 972). Wolfgang's services in this new position were of the highest importance, not only for the diocese, but also for the cause of civilization. As Bishop of Regensburg, Wolfgang became the tutor of Emperor Saint Henry II, who learned from him the principles which governed his saintly and energetic life. Poppe, son of Margrave Luitpold, Archbishop of Trier (1018), and Tagino, Archbishop of Magdeburg (1004-1012), also had him as their teacher. Wolfgang deserves credit for his disciplinary labours in his diocese. His main work in this respect was connected with the ancient and celebrated St. Emmeram's Abbey, which he reformed by granting it once more abbots of its own, thus withdrawing it from the control of the bishops of Regensburg, who for many years had been abbots in commendam, a condition of affairs that had been far from beneficial to the abbey and monastic life. In the Benedictine monk Romuald, whom Saint Wolfgang called from Saint Maximin at Trier, Saint Emmeram received a capable abbot (975). The saint also reformed the convents of Oberm√ºnster and Niederm√ºnster at Regensburg, chiefly by giving them as an example the convent of St. Paul, Mittelm√ºnster, at Regensburg, which he had founded in 983. He also co-operated in the reform of the ancient and celebrated Benedictine Abbey of Niederaltaich, which had been founded by the Agilolfinger dynasty, and which from that time took on new life. He showed genuine episcopal generosity in the liberal manner with which he met the views of the Emperor Otto II regarding the intended reduction in size of his diocese for the benefit of the new Diocese of Prague (975), to which Saint Adalbert was appointed first bishop. As prince of the empire he performed his duties towards the emperor and the empire with the utmost scrupulousness and, like Saint Ulrich, was one of the mainstays of the Ottonian policies. He took part in the various imperial diets, and, in the autumn of 978, accompanied the Emperor Otto II on his campaign to Paris, and took part in the Diet of Verona in June 983. He was succeeded by Gebhard I. Hermitage and death Towards the end of his life Saint Wolfgang withdrew as a hermit to a solitary spot, now the Wolfgangsee (\\"Wolfgang's Lake\\") in the Salzkammergut region of Upper Austria, apparently on account of a political dispute, but probably in the course of a journey of inspection to Mondsee Abbey which was under the direction of the bishops of Regensburg. He was discovered by a hunter and brought back to Regensburg. While travelling on the Danube to P√∂chlarn in Lower Austria, he fell ill at the village of Pupping, which is between Eferding and the market town of Aschach near Linz, and at his request was carried into the chapel of Saint Othmar at Pupping, where he died. His body was taken up the Danube by his friends Count Aribo of Andechs and Archbishop Hartwich of Salzburg to Regensburg, and was solemnly buried in the crypt of Saint Emmeram. Many miracles were performed at his grave; in 1052 he was canonized. Veneration Saint Wolfgang as depicted in the Kefermarkt altarpiece Soon after Wolfgang's death many churches chose him as their patron saint, and various towns were named after him. In Christian art he has been especially honoured by the great medieval Tyrolean painter, Michael Pacher (1430-1498), who created an imperishable memorial to him, the high altar of St. Wolfgang. In the panel pictures which are now exhibited in the Old Pinakothek at Munich are depicted in an artistic manner the chief events in the saint's life. The Kefermarkt altarpiece in Kefermarkt in Upper Austria is another monumental Late Gothic piece of art dedicated to the saint. The oldest portrait of Saint Wolfgang is a miniature, painted about the year 1100 in the celebrated Evangeliary of Saint Emmeram, now in the library of the castle cathedral at Krak√≥w. A modern picture by Schwind is in the Schack Gallery at Munich. This painting represents the legend of Wolfgang forcing the devil to help him to build a church. In other paintings he is generally depicted in episcopal dress, an axe in the right hand and the crozier in the left, or as a hermit in the wilderness being discovered by a hunter. The axe refers to an incident in the life of the saint. After having selected a solitary spot in the wilderness, he prayed and then threw his axe into the thicket; the spot on which the axe fell he regarded as the place where God intended he should build his cell. This axe is still shown in the little market town of St. Wolfgang which sprang up on the spot of the old cell. Saint Wolfgang is sometimes counted among the Fourteen Holy Helpers. Literature At the request of the Abbey of St. Emmeram, the life of Saint Wolfgang was written by Otloh, a Benedictine monk of St. Emmeram about 1050. This life is especially important for the early medieval history both of the church and of civilization in Bavaria and Austria, and it forms the basis of all later accounts of the saint. The oldest and best manuscript of this Vita is in the library of Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland (MS. No. 322), and has been printed with critical notes in Mon. Germ. His.: Script., IV, 524-542.

The Persians are thought to have initially migrated either from Central Asia or, more probably, from the north through the Caucasus. They would then have migrated to the current region of Persis in the early 1st millennium BC. The country name Persia was derived directly from the Old Persian Parsa.

British Museum. The ancient Persians were present in the region of Persis from about the 10th century BC. They became the rulers of the largest empire the world had yet seen under the Achaemenid dynasty which was established in the late 6th century BC, at its peak stretching from Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia and Eastern Europe proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in its far east. The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire, are located in Fars. Alexandrian Empire The Achaemenid Empire was defeated by Alexander the Great in 330 BC, incorporating most of their vast empire. Several Hellenistic satraps of Persis are known, following the conquests of Alexander the Great, from circa 330 BC, especially Phrasaortes, who ruled from 330 to 324 BC, Oxines who usurped his position and was then executed by Alexander, and the Macedonian general Peucestas, who learned the Persian language and followed local customs, implementing a persophile policy. Peucestas retained the satrapy of Persis until the Battle of Gabiene (316 BC), after which he was removed from his position by Antigonus. A short period of Antigonid rule followed, until Seleucus took possession of the region in 312 BC. Seleucid Empire Frataraka dynasty ruler Vadfradad I (Autophradates I). 3rd century BC. Istakhr (Persepolis) mint. When the Seleucid Empire was established, it possibly never extended its power beyond the main trade routes in Fars, and by the reign of Antiochus I or possibly later, Persis emerged as a state with a level of independence that minted its own coins.The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 3 (1), p. 299 ;\\"Frataraka\\" Governors of the Seleucid Empire Several later Persian rulers, forming the Frataraka dynasty, are known to have acted as representatives of the Seleucids in the region of FƒÅrs.

During an apparent transitional period, corresponding to the reigns of VƒÅdfradƒÅd II and another uncertain king, no titles of authority appeared on the reverse of their coins. The earlier title prtrk' zy alhaya (Frataraka) had disappeared. Under DƒÅrƒìv I however, the new title of mlk, or king, appeared, sometimes with the mention of prs (Persis), suggesting that the kings of Persis had become independent rulers. When the Parthian Arsacid king Mithridates I (ca. 171-138 BC) took control of Persis, he left the Persian dynasts in office, known as the Kings of Persis, and they were allowed to continue minting coins with the title of mlk (\\"King\\").The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 3 (1), p. 302 Sasanian Empire A Sassanid relief showing the investiture of Ardashir I Babak was the ruler of a small town called Kheir. Babak's efforts in gaining local power at the time escaped the attention of Artabanus IV, the Arsacid Emperor of the time. Babak and his eldest son Shapur managed to expand their power over all of Persis. The subsequent events are unclear, due to the sketchy nature of the sources. It is however certain that following the death of Babak around 220, Ardashir who at the time was the governor of Darabgird, got involved in a power struggle of his own with his elder brother Shapur. The sources tell us that in 222, Shapur was killed when the roof of a building collapsed on him. Ardax≈°ir (Artaxerxes) V, defeated the last legitimate Parthian king, Artabanos V in 224 CE, and was crowned at Ctesiphon as Ardax≈°ir I (Ardashir I), ≈°ƒÅhan≈°ƒÅh ƒ´ ƒírƒÅn, becoming the first king of the new Sasanian Empire. At this point, Ardashir moved his capital further to the south of Persis and founded a capital at Ardashir-Khwarrah (formerly Gur, modern day Firouzabad). After establishing his rule over Persis, Ardashir I rapidly extended the territory of his Sassanid Persian Empire, demanding fealty from the local princes of Fars, and gaining control over the neighboring provinces of Kerman, Isfahan, Susiana, and Mesene. Sarvestan Palace in Sarvestan Artabanus marched a second time against Ardashir I in 224. Their armies clashed at Hormizdegan, where Artabanus IV was killed. Ardashir was crowned in 226 at Ctesiphon as the sole ruler of Persia, bringing the 400-year-old Parthian Empire to an end, and starting the virtually equally long rule of the Sassanian Empire, over an even larger territory, once again making Persia a leading power in the known world, only this time along with its arch-rival and successor to Persia's earlier opponents (the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire); the Byzantine Empire. The Sassanids ruled for 425 years, until the Muslim armies conquered the empire. Afterward, the Persians started to convert to Islam, this making it much easier for the new Muslim empire to continue the expansion of Islam. Persis then passed hand to hand through numerous dynasties, leaving behind numerous historical and ancient monuments; each of which has its own values as a world heritage, reflecting the history of the province, Iran, and West Asia. The ruins of Bishapur, Persepolis, and Firouzabad are all reminders of this. Arab invaders brought about a decline of Zoroastrian rule and made Islam ascendant from the 7th century.

In 1886, by resolution of the Prussian Landtag, a Settlement Commission had been established to encourage German settlement in the Province of Posen and West Prussia. The Commission was empowered to purchase vacant property of the Polish szlachta and sell it to approved German applicants. The Prussian government regarded this as a measure designed to counteract the German \\"Flight from the East\\" (Ostflucht) and reduce the number of Poles, who were migrating to the area in hundreds of thousands looking for work. In Polish eyes, the establishment of the Commission was an aggressive measure designed to drive Poles from their lands.

Craven's investigations soon lead him into a murky world of government and corporate cover-ups and nuclear espionage, pitting him against dark forces that threaten the future of life on Earth. Writer Troy Kennedy Martin was greatly influenced by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry ‚Äì and by the implications of the Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew. First broadcast on BBC2, Edge of Darkness was met with such widespread critical acclaim that within days it had earned a repeat on BBC1. Winner of several prestigious awards, it remains highly regarded, often cited as one of the best and most influential pieces of British television drama. The series' director, Martin Campbell, filmed a remake, released in January 2010, starring Mel Gibson and set in the United States. Plot =One: Compassionate Leave= Bob Peck as Ronald Craven in Edge of Darkness Yorkshire Bradford police officer Ronald Craven is returning home with his daughter Emma having picked her up from a meeting of an environmental organisation at her university campus. On the doorstep of their home Emma is shot dead. The police concentrate their effort on the theory that her murder was a botched attempt on Craven's life by a criminal he had been responsible for convicting. However, as Craven goes through Emma's belongings, he discovers a geiger counter and a gun. He also learns that Emma's body and her possessions are radioactive. Travelling to London to assist with the inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton, a polished official \\"attached to the Prime Minister's office\\", who informs him that Emma was known to them as a terrorist and that she may have been the gunman's target. =Two: Into The Shadows= As he continues his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match those of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven to meet his colleague, Harcourt, who informs him that Emma was a member of a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh, an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium. =Three: Burden of Proof= The police close in on their suspect, Lowe, who is severely injured in a fall while trying to escape. Dying, he tells Craven he was working with McCroon, a terrorist Craven had had convicted in Northern Ireland. Emma's boyfriend, Terry Shields, tells Craven that she was investigating a hot cell in Northmoor; he is later killed. Craven meets Harcourt and Pendleton at the House of Commons where an inquiry is taking place into the sale of International Irradiated Fuels (IIF) ‚Äì Northmoor's owners ‚Äì to the Fusion Corporation of Kansas, owned by Jerry Grogan. Pendleton tells Craven that he believes Grogan was behind Emma's death. Returning to Yorkshire for Emma's funeral, Craven is refused permission to seek a warrant to enter Northmoor. Returning home, he is observed by McCroon. =Four: Breakthrough= McCroon breaks into Craven's house intent on killing him. Craven demands McCroon tell him who he is working for but McCroon is shot by a police marksman before he can say anything. Through a contact of Mac (Struan Roger), a colleague from his time in Northern Ireland, Craven gains access to a terminal connected to the MI5 computer. He checks the MI5 records for GAIA, Northmoor and Emma and learns that McCroon was acting on the orders of Northmoor Security. He also obtains a three-dimensional map of Northmoor from the computer. Craven contacts Jedburgh and asks him to accompany him inside Northmoor. =Five: Northmoor= Craven and Jedburgh penetrate Northmoor and discover the hot cell which has been sealed off following an explosion - a consequence of GAIA's attempted break-in. Jedburgh, under orders from the CIA, enters the hot cell and steals the plutonium. At the House of Commons inquiry, IIF chief executive Robert Bennett is forced to admit the presence of plutonium at Northmoor and the deaths of the GAIA team. =Six: Fusion= Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor but both are dying from radiation poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also present at the conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing the power of the atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan. Emma's ghost appears to Craven and tells him of a time when black flowers grew, warming the Earth and preventing life from becoming extinct. She tells him that the black flowers have returned and will melt the polar icecaps, destroying mankind so that life can continue. Craven goes to dissuade Jedburgh from the next step in his plan, which is to cause a nuclear explosion in Scotland with the rest of the plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service follow him and kill Jedburgh. Craven, like Jedburgh and Grogan fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into the mountains to die, calling Emma's name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing, foreshadowing the planet's war against humanity. Principal credits =Cast= * Ronald Craven was played by Bob Peck, an actor who was well known in theatre but, at the time he was cast as Craven, had appeared in only minor roles on television. In creating the role of Craven, Peck drew upon his experience gained from the two years he played the title role in Macbeth for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Notable roles after Edge of Darkness included On the Black Hill (1987), Slipstream (1989), Natural Lies (1992) and Jurassic Park (1993). He died in 1999. * Joanne Whalley, who played Emma Craven, began acting during childhood, appearing in the long-running soap opera Coronation Street (1960‚Äìpresent) in 1976 at the age of 10. She had also appeared in supporting roles in several series including Juliet Bravo (1980‚Äì1985), Bergerac (1981‚Äì1991) and Reilly, Ace of Spies (1983). Following Edge of Darkness, Whalley was cast in the equally well regarded BBC television serial The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter. Moving to Hollywood, she appeared in such films as Willow (1988), Scandal (1989) and Shattered (1991) as well as television mini-series such as Scarlett (1994) and Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis (2000). During her eight-year marriage to the actor Val Kilmer, between 1988 and 1996, she was often credited as Joanne Whalley-Kilmer. * Cast as Darius Jedburgh was Joe Don Baker, who had been acting since the 1960s and was known for his roles in Westerns such as Gunsmoke (1955‚Äì1975) and as the lead in the detective series Eischied (1979‚Äì1980). He also starred as Sherriff Buford Pusser in the original 1972 film Walking Tall. The script of Edge of Darkness so impressed him that he agreed to take the part at lower than his usual fee.Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 56. He was later cast, by Edge of Darkness director Martin Campbell, as CIA agent Jack Wade in the James Bond film GoldenEye (1995), a role he reprised in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). * Charles Kay, who played Pendleton, was a well established character actor who had appeared in Fall of Eagles (1974), I, Claudius (1976) and The Devil's Crown (1978). He has since acted in many television productions such as Fortunes of War (1989), The Darling Buds of May (1991‚Äì1993), Jonathan Creek (1997‚Äì2004) and Midsomer Murders (1997‚Äìpresent). * Edge of Darkness was an early role for Ian McNeice, who played Harcourt. He went on to act in a wide variety of film and television parts including The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain (1995), Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) and Frank Herbert's Dune (2000), as well as regular roles in Doc Martin (2004‚Äìpresent), Rome (2005‚Äì2007) and regular appearances as Winston Churchill in the BBC's revived Doctor Who. Several other faces familiar to British viewers appeared during the course of the episodes, including John Woodvine (as Craven's superior DCS Ross), Tim McInnerny (as Emma's boyfriend Terry Shields), Hugh Fraser (as IIF chief executive Robert Bennett), Zo√´ Wanamaker (as intelligence agent Clementine) and Blake's 7 cast members David Jackson (as Colonel Lawson) and Brian Croucher (as Northmoor security chief Connors). Playing themselves were television reporters Sue Cook and Kenneth Kendall, weatherman Bill Giles and Labour MP Michael Meacher. Long-standing BBC visual effects designer Mat Irvine, who contributed visual effects to the series, received a brief cameo as a police diver in \\"Breakthrough\\". =Crew= * Writer Troy Kennedy Martin was the creator of the long-running BBC police drama Z-Cars (1962‚Äì1978). He also wrote the screenplay for the films The Italian Job (1969) and Kelly's Heroes (1970) and scripts for television series such as Colditz (1972‚Äì1974), The Sweeney (1975‚Äì1978) (which was created by his brother Ian Kennedy Martin) and Reilly, Ace of Spies (1983). Following Edge of Darkness, he wrote the screenplays for the films Red Heat (with Walter Hill) (1988) and Bravo Two Zero (1999). He died in September 2009. * Director Martin Campbell had developed a reputation for handling action thrillers with credits including The Professionals (1977‚Äì1983), Minder (1979‚Äì1994) and Shoestring (1979‚Äì1980). A few years after Edge of Darkness, Campbell moved into feature films, directing the James Bond films GoldenEye (1995) and Casino Royale (2006) as well as The Mask of Zorro (1998), Vertical Limit (2000) and The Legend of Zorro (2005). * Producer Michael Wearing had worked on Play for Today for which he had produced Alan Bleasdale's The Black Stuff (1978) and which he and Bleasdale subsequently spun off into the highly acclaimed Boys from the Blackstuff (1982). He also produced the conspiracy thriller Bird of Prey (1982). Following Edge of Darkness he continued to be one of British television's most high profile and successful producers, appointed Head of Serials at the BBC between 1989 and 1998 where he was responsible for such programmes as Pride and Prejudice (1995), Our Friends in the North (1996) and Dennis Potter's final two plays Karaoke (1996) and Cold Lazarus (1996). * Walt Patterson, who acted as series adviser, was a leading commentator on nuclear affairs, best known for his book Nuclear Power (Penguin, 1976‚Äì1986). Following Edge of Darkness, he acted as specialist adviser to the British House of Commons Select committee on Environment for their 1986 study, Radioactive Waste. He continues to contribute to the policy debate about energy and environmental issues. Advice on the policing aspects of the serial was provided by the West Yorkshire Police and former Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper, famous for his pursuit of the train robber Ronnie Biggs.Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 55. =Music= The musical score was provided by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen. Clapton was approached to provide the score by producer Michael Wearing.Vanezis, Magnox: The Secrets of Edge of Darkness. Shortly afterwards, when Michael Kamen brought Clapton to a screening of Brazil (1985), which he, Kamen, had scored, Eric suggested a collaboration between the two on Edge of Darkness. Kamen became one of Hollywood's most successful film composers, writing the scores for many blockbuster films including the Lethal Weapon series (1987‚Äì1998) (with Eric Clapton), the first three Die Hard films (1988, 1990, 1995), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) and X-Men (2000). He died in 2003. Aside from the Clapton/Kamen soundtrack, Willie Nelson's \\"The Time of the Preacher\\", New Model Army's \\"Christian Militia\\", and Tom Waits' \\"16 Shells From A Thirty-Ought-Six\\" are featured in the series. \\"Christian Militia\\" is on the record player when Terry's body is found. Craven listens to \\"The Time of the Preacher\\" when he is in Emma's room in the first episode. It later emerges Jedburgh is familiar with the song and both he and Craven sing it on two occasions, the lyrics being significant. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation used the music to illustrate stories on the Chernobyl disaster the following year. Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen performed the movie's main theme with the National Philharmonic Orchestra during the 24 Nights period in 1990 and 1991. Background =Origins= James Lovelock (2005) developed the Gaia hypothesis that is important to the plot \\"I am writing this story about a detective who turns into a tree\\" was what writer Troy Kennedy Martin told his colleagues when asked what he was working on during the early 1980s.Kennedy Martin, Introduction. Kennedy Martin had become frustrated that \\"at the BBC there was no political dimension to their drama whatsoever\\" but had chosen to write a political story anyway, not really believing it would ever get made. The election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister and Ronald Reagan as President of the United States had brought about a major shift in the global political landscape. Kennedy Martin was motivated to write out of concern arising from such issues as the Greenham Common protests, the Falklands War, the Miners' strike and arising out of the escalation of the Cold War the fear that ‚Äúborn-again Christians and Cold War warriors appeared to be running the United States\\". By 1983, Kennedy Martin had written the first draft of what became Edge of Darkness ‚Äì at this stage it was called Magnox (a reference to the Magnox type of nuclear reactor) and was about trade union problems in the nuclear industry.Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 52. The script was given to BBC Head of Drama Series & Serials, Jonathan Powell, who encouraged Kennedy Martin to continue its development.Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 53. The script went through many changes and revisions. A particular influence was the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 announcing the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) which proposed protecting the United States from attack by nuclear missiles. One of the supporters of SDI was Lyndon LaRouche, on whom Kennedy Martin based the character of Jerry Grogan, owner of the Fusion Corporation of Kansas. Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the secrecy surrounding the UK's policy on nuclear power in light of the inquiry into the construction of the Sizewell B nuclear power station and the concerns about the safety record of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; this led him to conceive International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett. The other major influence was the Gaia hypothesis, that the Earth is a single living system that self-regulates to maintain the optimum conditions for life, formulated by climate scientist James Lovelock and popularised in his 1979 book Gaia: A new look at life on Earth. Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA for the environmental organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh grass that grew on the surface of the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life, simulated in Lovelock's Daisyworld model. Although Kennedy Martin's notion for the serial was influenced by real political events, he had for a long time railed against naturalism in television drama ‚Äì most notably in a 1964 article for the theatre magazine Encore, titled \\"Nats Go Home. First Statement of a New Drama for Television\\", in which he sought \\"to free the camera from photographing dialogue, to free the structure from natural time and to exploit the total and absolute objectivity of the television camera\\".Cooke, British Television Drama: A History, p. 64 Edge of Darkness producer Michael Wearing has noted that \\"there is a mystical dimension to Troy's imagination. His instincts are visual and non-naturalistic\\".Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 104. Kennedy Martin, therefore, crafted a serial that on the one hand placed its events squarely within the real, present day world but on the other also placed itself within the realm of the mystical and the mythic.Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 112. Realism and authenticity was provided by the appearances of real life television presenter Sue Cook and Labour MP Michael Meacher. There was also use of contemporary stock footage, such as Robin Day's interview with Margaret Thatcher and references to real persons like Michael Heseltine and places such as Sellafield, alongside the references to fictitious characters and places contained in the plot. The mystical dimension is provided by Emma's ghost while the mythic is provided by Craven himself and by Jedburgh and Grogan. Kennedy Martin, influenced by John Darragh's The Real Camelot (Thames and Hudson, 1981) which examined the pagan origins of the Arthurian legend, saw Craven as a modern-day Green Man who would confront the threats to the Earth on behalf of Gaia. Jedburgh was conceived by Kennedy Martin as a Knight of the Marches, one of the Teutonic Knights who defended the borders of Eastern Europe, opposed to Grogan, who Kennedy Martin saw as a descendant of the Knights Templar who, according to legend, had guarded a special wisdom in the Temple of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. These aspects would reach their apotheosis in the serial's conclusion in which Kennedy Martin envisaged that Craven, having found the plutonium stolen by Jedburgh, would be shot by a sniper and would be transformed into a tree. =Production= By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put the serial into production and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, \\"Compassionate Leave\\", depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as \\"the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember\\".Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 54. The budget was set at ¬£2 million, of which ¬£400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular to the notion that Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest.Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 54 - 55. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that \\"it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't be able to make it work for the audience\\", a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was \\"likely not to come off as an effect\\". Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, \\"Burden of Proof\\", the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 113. Shooting on Edge of Darkness began on 9 July 1984 and ran for five months until 5 December 1984.Pixley, Into The Shadows, p. 50. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International Kensington), Yorkshire (including the headquarters of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the Arlington Business Centre) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley (for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's Reykjav√≠k policy was formulatedInglis, Citizenship and the Media, p. 55.) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes).Pixley, Into The Shadows, passim Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as Magnox; the title Dark Forces was briefly considered before the serial was renamed Edge of Darkness in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, \\"I think we knew when we were making it that it was a good piece of work\\" while Kennedy Martin told reporters \\"I haven't had this feeling about something for 20 years. It's wonderful, after all this time, to get something that actually works\\". Broadcast and critical reception Edge of Darkness was promoted on the cover of the listings magazine Radio Times and was broadcast on Monday nights on BBC2 at 9:30pm, beginning 4 November 1985.Pixley, Into The Shadows, p. 51. The serial averaged an audience of 4 million viewers over its run.Cooke, British Television Drama: A History, p. 147. The critical response was generally positive with most commentators concentrating their praise on Peck's performance as Craven and the scale of the programme's political themes. \\"A good television thriller is very hard to find but Edge of Darkness promises to be one of the best\\", wrote Celia Brayfield in The Times, \\"The central character is played by Bob Peck, who has the gift of looking tragic and intelligent simultaneously. [...] There was humour to lift the gloom and superb characterisation to flesh out the stock situation\\". Ruth Baumgarten, in The Listener, praised the serial as \\"a grandiosely ambitious and compelling piece of fiction\\". Speaking on the BBC's review programme Did You See...?, the writer Sarah Dunant said, \\"this is a very classy piece of television drama, on all levels, I think on the plot level, I think on the level of emotion and I think stylistically [...] it looks absolutely wonderful, it's shot like a feature film\\". Not so impressed was Byron Rogers, television critic of The Sunday Times, who initially hailed the series as one that \\"stayed in the mind and will stay there long [...] because of its portrayal of human grief\\" but later felt he was \\"beginning to find Edge of Darkness slightly irritating\\" and decried the final episode as \\"an insult to its considerable following\\". Aware of the critical buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, \\"I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it\\", and so Edge of Darkness was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC's history.Pixley, Into The Shadows, p. 52. These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip. It was a move that paid off ‚Äì Edge of Darkness doubled its audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers. Cultural significance Edge of Darkness tapped into a cultural zeitgeist of concern about nuclear power and nuclear warfare in the early to mid 1980s. In 1980, current affairs programme Panorama broadcast \\"If The Bomb Drops\\", a documentary that examined how well prepared Britain was for a nuclear attack; in 1983, The Day After an American TV movie about a nuclear war aired, as well as seeing the release of the feature film WarGames, showing the 'no winner' outcome of nuclear war; in 1984, the BBC broadcast On the Eighth Day, a documentary about the effects of a nuclear winter and Threads, a drama about a nuclear attack on Sheffield while 1985 saw the first screening of Peter Watkins' nuclear war television film The War Game, banned on television since 1965.Kibble-White, Let's All Hide in the Linen Cupboard. Edge of Darkness also rode on a wave of preoccupation with the secretive nature of the State in both fact (e.g. This Week's ‚ÄúDeath on the Rock‚Äù (1988) about the deaths of three Provisional IRA members in Gibraltar and Secret Society (1987) about undisclosed matters of public interest which led to the sacking of BBC Director General Alasdair Milne) and fiction (e.g. the films Defence of the Realm (1985) and The Whistle Blower (1987) and the television serials A Very British Coup (1988) and Traffik (1989)).Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 107. Edge of Darkness continues to be well regarded to this day. When it was repeated on BBC2 in 1992, Sean Day-Lewis wrote in The Daily Telegraph, ‚ÄúEdge of Darkness is a masterpiece. It is one of those very rare television creations so rich in form and content that the spectator wishes there was some way of prolonging it indefinitely\\".Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 103 - 104. Andrew Lavender, writing in British Television Drama in the 1980s, has said that Edge of Darkness \\"captured the spirit of its age but went far beyond the drama of its time. [...] It pushed against expectations attaching to the thriller form, often transcending the limits of the genre\\".Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 103. Fred Inglis, in his analysis of the serial in Formations: 20th Century Media Studies, takes it \\"as one of the most remarkable works of art made for British television\\". According to Lez Cooke, in British Television Drama: A History, \\"In a reactionary climate, when the possibilities for the production of 'social issue' drama were limited, Edge of Darkness proved that, by adapting to changed circumstances and adopting a serialised thriller format, it was still possible to produce ambitious and progressive television drama in Britain in the mid-1980s\\",Cooke, British Television Drama: A History, p. 148. a view echoed by Sean Cubit in EcoMedia who notes that \\"the series neatly echoed the chill that descended on radical politics in the Thatcher years in the United Kingdom\\".Cubitt, Edge of Darkness: eco-terrorism and the public sphere, p. 79. The television historian Andrew Pixley has described the series as \\"possibly the finest BBC drama ever made\\" and \\"one of the few television programmes where every element can be said to have worked to complete effect\\";Pixley, Into The Shadows, p. 53. John Hartley, in Tele- ology: Studies in Television, called it \\"the best police drama series ever made for television\\" and said that \\"its method of investigative drama can unravel some of the complexities of public life more truthfully than investigative journalism\\".Hartley, Tele-ology, p. 202-203 Edge of Darkness was placed fifteenth (fourth position out of the dramas featured on the list) on the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes in 2000, the BFI describing it as \\"a gripping, innovative six-part drama which fully deserves its cult status and many awards\\". Radio Times television editor Alison Graham, in 2003, listed it as one of the forty greatest television programmes ever made. It was one of only seven dramas listed in Broadcast magazine's list of the fifty most influential television programmes, published in July 2004. In March 2007, Edge of Darkness was placed third in Channel 4's list of the Greatest TV Dramas. Also on Channel 4, Darius Jedburgh was listed eighty-fourth in their list of the One Hundred Greatest TV Characters in 2001. Awards Edge of Darkness received eleven nominations and won six awards at the 1986 BAFTA Awards: * Won: Best Drama Series/Serial (Martin Campbell & Michael Wearing) * Won: Best Actor (Bob Peck). * Nominated: Best Actor (Joe Don Baker). * Nominated: Best Actress (Joanne Whalley). * Won: Best Original Television Music (Eric Clapton & Michael Kamen). * Won: Best Film Cameraman (Andrew Dunn). * Won: Best Film Editor (Ardan Fisher, Dan Rae). * Won: Best Film Sound (Dickie Bird, Rob James, Christopher Swanton, Tony Quinn). * Nominated: Best Makeup (Daphne Croker). * Nominated: Best Graphics (Andy Coward, Linda Sherwood-Page). * Nominated: Best Design (Graeme Thompson). At the 1986 Broadcasting Press Guild television critics' awards, Edge of Darkness won two awards: * Won: Best Actor (Bob Peck) (joint winner with Ben Kingsley for Silas Marner). * Nominated: Best Actor (Joe Don Baker). * Won: Best Drama Series. Hollywood adaptation In 2010, a Hollywood remake of the show was released in cinemas. It was released on 28 January in the UK, 29 January in the US and 4 February in Australia. Mel Gibson plays Detective Craven. The film is directed by Martin Campbell, who also directed the original. Home media Edge of Darkness was released on VHS videotape by the BBC in 1987.Pixley, Into the Shadows, p. 53. There was also a release from CBS/Fox Video in North America at the same time. The soundtrack was also released as an album entitled Edge of Darkness. The serial was re-issued on VHS in 1998 by Revelation Films who also issued the serial on DVD in 1999. In 2003, BBC Worldwide re-issued Edge of Darkness on DVD (encoded for both regions 2 and 4) with several extra features including Magnox: The Secrets of Edge of Darkness, a specially made \\"making-of\\" documentary; an isolated soundtrack of Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen's score; a Bob Peck interview from BBC Breakfast Time; a contemporary report on the programme's BAFTA wins and coverage of the programme's wins at the Broadcasting Press Guild awards.Edge of Darkness (DVD), BBC Worldwide, 2003.

She performed this feat in 1988 in her yacht Blackmores First Lady, taking 189 days. Personal life Born Kay McLaren‚Äîthe youngest of four daughters‚Äîin Sydney on 25 January 1954, Cottee grew up in the southern Sydney suburb of Sans Souci. She was born into a yachting family and was taken sailing for the first time when only a few weeks old. For secondary schooling, she attended Moorefield Girls High School in Kogarah, New South Wales. Cottee now lives in Yamba on the far NSW north coast with television producer husband Peter Sutton. She is an international motivational speaker, skilled boat builder, writer, painter and sculptor. Solo circumnavigation the yacht Blackmores First Lady On 5 June 1988 at age 34, Kay Cottee became the first woman to sail round the world alone non-stop and unassisted when she sailed through Sydney heads. She was greeted by tens of thousands of well-wishers. Cottee had left the harbour 189 days earlier, on 29 November 1987. The historic voyage on her 37 ft yacht Blackmores First Lady was also the fastest sailing trip around the world by a woman and the first solo, non-stop and unassisted voyage around the world by a woman. In the Southern Ocean, Cottee's boat was knocked down continuously and she was washed overboard. When Cottee rounded Cape Horn, the southernmost tip of South America, she celebrated with a lunch of crab, mayonnaise and self baked bread, and a bottle of Grange, a prestigious Australian wine. Cottee and her major sponsor Blackmores Limited used the voyage to raise over $1M for the Rev. Ted Noffs' Life Education Program. Cottee also undertook an 18-month national schools tour, speaking to over 40,000 senior high school students, imparting the message you can achieve your dreams if you work steadily towards them.

Its church is known as the Cathedral of the Moors on account of its tall tower and its size, relative to the small population it serves. It is a favourite tourist centre, partly for its scenic character and partly for its connection to the popular song ‚ÄúWidecombe Fair‚Äù. History The name is thought to derive from 'Withy-combe' which means Willow Valley. According to Widecombe's official website, there are 196 households in the village, although its large and sprawling parish stretches for many miles and encompasses dozens of isolated cottages and moorland farms. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the north, by the parishes of Manaton, Ilsington, Ashburton, Buckland-in-the-Moor, Holne and Dartmoor Forest. Tourism is a major source of income for Widecombe today, and within a small area of the village there are several gift shops (including a National Trust shop), two cafes and two pubs (the Old Inn and the Rugglestone). The village is well known for Widecombe Fair, held annually and celebrated by a folksong of the same name, featuring \\"Old Uncle Tom Cobley and All\\". Its words were first published in 1880, and the characters from the song are featured in many of the souvenirs on sale in the local shops. Also popular are the traditional Toby Jugs; a type of mug, with a handle, shaped as a three- dimensional caricature of a person's head, sometimes fictional, sometimes a celebrity. The church The church of St Pancras is known as the \\"Cathedral of the Moors\\" in recognition of its 120-foot tower and relatively large capacity for such a small village. Originally built in the fourteenth century, in the Perpendicular style (late Gothic), using locally quarried granite, it was enlarged over the following two centuries, partly on the proceeds of the local tin mining trade. Inside, the ceiling is decorated with a large number of decorative roof bosses, including the tinner‚Äôs emblem of a circle of three hares (known locally as the Tinners' Rabbits). St Pancras Church, Widecombe- in-the-Moor It was badly damaged in the Great Thunderstorm of 1638, apparently struck by ball lightning during an afternoon service. The building was packed with about 300 worshippers, four of whom were killed and around 60 injured. Local legend relates that the disaster was caused by a visit from the Devil. Education The Karuna Institute, a collaboration partner of Middlesex University is located here.Current collaboration partners ‚Äì Middlesex University London Widecombe Primary School is a primary school that educates around 70 pupils. Other features Widecombe Valley In Widecombe churchyard is the grave of novelist Beatrice Chase who lived for much of her life in a cottage close to the village. Next to the church stands the Church House, built in 1537. It is thought to have originally been built as a brewery for the production of church ales, became adapted as an almshouse, and later became the village school. Today, it is used as a meeting place for local people. Sexton's Cottage forms the western end of the building and is now a National Trust shop and Dartmoor National Park information point. It is now managed by the National Trust. Standing in front of the building is a 15-inch naval shell, which was donated to the village after the First World War to thank the villagers for supplying troops with sphagnum moss. This grows in abundance in the damp Dartmoor conditions, and is said to have healing properties. It was used as an emergency field dressing for injured troops. The size of the parish meant that, for centuries, families were obliged to walk for miles to attend the church every Sunday. The task was even more challenging when it came to burying their dead, whose coffins had to be carried over rough ground and both up and down exceptionally steep hills. Halfway up Dartmeet Hill, for example, lies the Coffin Stone, close to the road, where the body would be placed to allow the bearers to take a rest. The rock is split in two, along its length. Local legend has it that the body of a particularly wicked man was laid there. God took exception to this, and struck the stone with a thunderbolt, destroying the coffin and splitting the stone in two. The deserted medieval village of Hutholes and the abandoned farmstead Dinna Clerks (also spelt Dinah Clark's) are nearby. The Rippon Tor Rifle Range lies within five miles of the village. In popular culture In the reality show Celebrity Ghost Stories, American actor Daniel Stern claimed to have had an unsettling, and possibly supernatural, experience while on a brief visit to the village during his honeymoon in 1980. He also recounted that people in the region considered Widecombe to be haunted, and that the Great Thunderstorm of 1638 was blamed. The official Widecombe-in-the-Moor website responded to the claims and dismissed the alleged hauntings as a legend borne of superstitions.http://www.widecombe-in-the-moor.com/ghost_town.phpCelebrity Ghost Stories, Season 2 Episode 15, December 11, 2010 In 2010, Widecombe-in- the-Moor was one of the filming locations for the Steven Spielberg film War Horse.

It was the second competitive flight in the Ansari X Prize competition to demonstrate a non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft, and is hence also referred to as the X2 flight. It was a successful flight, winning the X PRIZE. Crew Scheduling Brian Binnie flight preflight before the final SpaceShipOne flight 17P Brian Binnie runs his Prelaunch Checklist inside SpaceShipOne flight 17P To win the X PRIZE, a spacecraft needed to make two successful competitive flights within 14 days. SpaceShipOne made a successful competitive flight on September 29, 2004, and so needed to make a second by October 13, 2004 in order to win. Scaled Composites aimed to be able to fly three times within the two weeks in order to allow for a failed flight. The date of the flight, October 4, 2004, was the 47th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and the same day astronaut Gordon Cooper died. SpaceShipOne's first powered flight was, in a similar vein, on the 100th anniversary of the first ever powered flight by the Wright Brothers. The da Vinci Project, another X PRIZE contender, planned to make its first competitive flight on October 2, 2004, which might have caused a race to develop, affecting the scheduling. However, they encountered problems and had to delay their flights. Tier One was therefore able to follow their original flight schedule. Scaled Composites reported that they could have turned the spacecraft around faster than the five days they actually allowed for it. It was anticipated by observers that Mike Melvill, the pilot on both previous spaceflights by SpaceShipOne, would pilot this flight also. This expectation was not supported by any real evidence, but was based on Melvill's prior experience. On the morning of the flight it was announced that Brian Binnie would be the pilot. Manifest Under Ansari X PRIZE rules, the flight was required to carry 180 kg payload, to simulate two 90 kg human passengers. Whereas Scaled Composites stated that the first competitive flight would not carry passengers, it did not make any such statement about later competitive flights. It seemed possible that Burt Rutan would be a passenger on flight 17P, but in the end he was not, since the FAA has restricted the flight to just the pilot and no passengers. The payload included: *X PRIZE flight monitoring equipment, known as the \\"gold box\\" *the Explorers Club flag, by arrangement between the Explorers Club and the X PRIZE Foundation The same logos were carried as on flight 16P: *Scaled Composites *\\"SpaceShipOne: a Paul G.

This was the local civil time at the spaceport on the day of the flight. The SpaceShipOne pilot was Brian Binnie. White Knight was piloted by Mike Melvill. Taxiing, scheduled for 06:30, began at 06:36. Takeoff from Mojave Spaceport, scheduled for 07:00, took place at 06:49. White Knight then carried SpaceShipOne to the launch altitude, in excess of 43,500 feet (13.3 km). SpaceShipOne separated from White Knight at 07:49, and promptly ignited its rocket. The rocket motor was capable of burning for approximately 87 s. The burn-out altitude was in excess of 200,000 feet (61 km). After burn-out the craft continued to coast upwards. The wing was feathered, into high-drag configuration, during the coasting phase. The spacecraft coasted to apogee at an altitude of ,\\"FAI Record ID #9881 - Altitude above the earth's surface with or without maneuvres of the aerospacecraft, Class P-1 (Suborbital missions) \\" Mass Time F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI).

After apogee, SpaceShipOne reentered the atmosphere in its feathered configuration, and then changed to gliding configuration at 07:57. SpaceShipOne then glided back to the spaceport, deployed landing gear at 4,200 feet (1.28 km), and landed safely at 08:13. White Knight then landed at 08:19. Spectacle SpaceShipOne Camp Mojave Mission 17P As with SpaceShipOne's previous spaceflights, a large crowd watched from Mojave Spaceport. There was also live television coverage, and various websites provided coverage in their medium of preference. Distinguished attendees included: *Richard Branson, of Virgin Galactic *Paul Allen, of Mojave Aerospace Ventures *Rick Searfoss, chief X PRIZE judge *Jerry Pournelle, science fiction author X PRIZE The Ansari X PRIZE requires that two spaceflights be made by the same spacecraft within two weeks. SpaceShipOne successfully made its first competitive flight (flight 16P) on September 29, 2004. This second successful competitive flight therefore won the X PRIZE. This was declared by Rick Searfoss, the chief X PRIZE judge, at a post-flight press briefing. The prize was awarded on November 6, 2004. Retirement SpaceShipOne now hangs in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. On July 25, 2005 SpaceShipOne was taken to the Oshkosh Airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. After the airshow, Mike Melvill and crew flew the White Knight, carrying SpaceShipOne, to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Melvill spoke to a group of about 300 military and civilian personnel. Later in the evening, Melvill gave a presentation at the Dayton Engineers Club, entitled \\"Some Experiments in Space Flight\\", in honor of Wilbur Wright's now-famous presentation to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1901 entitled \\"Some Experiments in Flight.\\" The White Knight then transported SpaceShipOne to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum to be put on display. It was unveiled on Wednesday October 5, 2005 in the Milestones of Flight gallery and is now on display to the public in the main atrium with the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the Wright Flyer, and the Apollo 11 command module Columbia. Commander Brian Binnie donated the flight suit worn during his Ansari X Prize-winning flight to an auction benefiting Seattle's Museum of Flight. Entertainer and charity auctioneer Fred Northup, Jr. purchased the flight suit, and it is on loan and displayed at the museum's new Charles Simonyi Space Gallery.

He is best known as the producer of the well received serials Boys from the Blackstuff (1982) and Edge of Darkness (1985), which created for him a reputation as one of British television's foremost drama producers. His initial career was in the theatre, where he worked as a director, before in 1976 he joined the BBC's English Regions Drama Department as a Script Editor under producer David Rose. The department, based at the Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, had been set up as an attempt to counter the BBC's tradition of producing dramas that were almost exclusively made and set in London and the home counties, and was charged with making regional drama based in all areas of the country. Over the following five years, Wearing worked as both a script editor and producer on various series and plays for the department, with his most successful production there being the Play for Today entry The Black Stuff. Written by Alan Bleasdale, despite languishing on the shelf for two years waiting for a broadcast slot before being shown in 1980, the play was a great success and led to Bleasdale writing and Wearing producing Boys from the Blackstuff (1982), a sequel series showing what happened to the characters involved after the events of the play. This was highly acclaimed and award- winning, and led to Wearing being called down to work at the central BBC drama department in London. The first project he was given there by Head of Series & Serials Jonathan Powell was a Troy Kennedy Martin project entitled Edge of Darkness. Eventually screened in 1985, Edge of Darkness was another award- winner, and cemented Wearing's reputation. In 1989, he was made Head of Serials at the BBC, the Series and Serials departments now having been separated as they had originally been. In 1993, after Head of Series Peter Cregeen's departure from the Corporation, Wearing was briefly Head of Series & Serials, before his role was reduced to simply overseeing Serials again the following year. In his time as Head of Serials he oversaw the production of a great number of productions, among the most famous being the new era of costume drama literary adaptations such as Middlemarch (1993) and Pride and Prejudice (1995). However, perhaps his most lasting legacy was the BBC Two serial Our Friends in the North (1996). Written by playwright Peter Flannery, Our Friends in the North was a production Wearing had wanted to bring to the screens since the early 1980s, but due to various difficulties with budgets, potential libel and BBC executives, he had never been able to. Now, with a bulletproof reputation and as Head of Serials the ability to commission the production himself, he was finally able to persuade channel controller Michael Jackson to accept the serial, which was a resounding hit. In 1997, Wearing was given the honorary Alan Clarke Award for outstanding creative achievement in television at the British Academy Television Awards. In 1998 he left the staff of the BBC, although he worked for them subsequently as a freelance producer. References *Ahmed, Kamal. \\"Stifled\\" BBC drama chief quits. \\"The Guardian\\".

At that time she was the largest vessel ever to be wrecked. Design and history When laid down by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in the United States in 1959, she had a capacity of . However, the ship was later enlarged in Japan to capacity. At the time of the shipwreck she was owned by Barracuda Tanker Corporation, a subsidiary of the Union Oil Company of California, and registered in Liberia but chartered to British Petroleum. She was long, beam and had of draught.. Accident and oil spill On 19 February 1967, Torrey Canyon left the Kuwait National Petroleum Company refinery, at Mina, Kuwait (later Al Ahmadi) on her final voyage with a full cargo of crude oil. The ship reached the Canary Islands on 14 March. From there the planned route was to Milford Haven in Wales. Torrey Canyon struck Pollard's Rock on Seven Stones reef, between the Cornish mainland and the Isles of Scilly, on 18 March. It became grounded and, several days later, began to break up. In an effort to reduce the size of the oil spill, the British government decided to set the wreck on fire, by means of air strikes from the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and Royal Air Force (RAF). On 28 March 1967, FAA Blackburn Buccaneers from RNAS Lossiemouth dropped 1,000-pound bombs on the ship. Afterwards RAF Hawker Hunter from RAF Chivenor dropped cans of jet fuel (kerosene), to fuel the blaze. However, the fire was put out by high tides, and further strikes were needed to re-ignite the oil, by FAA de Havilland Sea Vixens from RNAS Yeovilton and Buccaneers from the RNAS Brawdy, as well as Hunters of No 1(F) Squadron RAF from RAF West Raynham with napalm. Bombing continued into the next day, until Torrey Canyon finally sank. A total of 161 bombs, 16 rockets, of napalm and of kerosene were used. Attempts to contain the oil using foam-filled containment booms were largely unsuccessful, due to the booms' fragility in high seas. =Guernsey= When the oil reached Guernsey seven days after the grounding, authorities scooped up the oil into sewage tankers and siphoned it off into a disused quarry in the northeast of the island. Some time later, micro-organisms were introduced to see if they could break the oil down into carbon dioxide and water. This was a limited success, so in 2010, a bio-remediation process was initiated to speed up the process. Aftermath An inquiry in Liberia, where the ship was registered, found Shipmaster Pastrengo Rugiati was to blame, because he took a shortcut to save time to get to Milford Haven. Additionally a design fault meant that the helmsman was unaware that the steering selector switch had been accidentally left on autopilot and hence was unable to carry out a timely turn to go through the shipping channel. The wreck lies at a depth of . In popular culture *Serge Gainsbourg composed and recorded the song \\"Torrey Canyon\\" about the incident. *The UK series Heartbeat ran an episode in which one of the characters lost his fortune by becoming a \\"name\\" (underwriter) for the Torrey Canyon. *The podcast Cautionary Tales aired an episode about the Torrey Canyon, and what we can learn from the accident.

The movie chronicles Crumb's career, highlighting his creations \\"Keep on Truckin'\\" and Fritz the Cat, and his pioneering role in the genesis of underground comix. Interviews with his family members and ex-girlfriends (such as Kathy Goodell), and commentary from critics like Robert Hughes and Trina Robbins, as well as selections from Crumb's vast artist output, shed light on Crumb's psychology and darkly cynical perspective on life. Portraits emerge as well of older brother Charles, who committed suicide before the film was released, and youngest brother Maxon, a panhandler who painted to assuage his inner demons. Though filmmaker Zwigoff had the consent of the Crumb brothers, some questioned the ability of the more disturbed brothers to provide that consent. The involvement of Charles and Maxon, which Zwigoff felt was just as important to Robert's story as anything else, led Zwigoff to title the film Crumb to imply the importance of all three brothers. Production Robert Crumb initially did not want to make the film, but eventually agreed. There was a rumor, accidentally created by Roger Ebert, that Terry Zwigoff made Crumb cooperate by threatening to shoot himself.

It is situated at the foot of the central Balkan Mountains, in the valley of the Yantra River, and is known as an international capital of humour and satire (see Gabrovo humour), as well as noted for its Bulgarian National Revival architecture. Gabrovo is also known as the longest town in Bulgaria, stretching over 25 km along the Yantra, yet reaching only in width at places. The geographic center of Bulgaria - Uzana is located near the town. Name Statue of Racho Kowatscha According to the most widespread legend, Gabrovo was founded by a blacksmith called Racho, close to whose fireplace a hornbeam rose, so the settlement acquired its name, from the Slavic word gabar (\\"hornbeam\\") + the Slavic suffix -ovo. History The area around Gabrovo, inhabited since the Neolithic, gained economic importance after Veliko Tarnovo became capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire in the 12th century. Craftsmanship and trade prospered due to the proximity to both the capital and the Balkan passes. Medieval Gabrovo was a small pass village of about 100 houses. After the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans in the 14th century, the demographic position of Gabrovo changed significantly, as it was the only settlement in a considerably large geographic area and an attractive place for Bulgarians fleeing from the conquered capital and neighbouring fortresses. It turned from a village into a small town (palanka) and began to develop as an economic, cultural and spiritual centre. Bulgarian Orthodox Theophany Crucession in Gabrovo. The priests are going to throw a wooden cross in Yantra. Believers will then jump into the icy waters to \\"save\\" the cross. During Ottoman rule, the rich tradesmen spent plenty of resources for the small town's public planning. The first Bulgarian secular school, the Aprilov National High School, was founded in Gabrovo in 1835 with the aid of Vasil Aprilov and Nikolay Palauzov. Gabrovo was officially proclaimed a town by the Ottoman authority in May 1860. In the 1870s Felix Kanitz said that Gabrovo is \\"a big workshop\\" and that it is a \\"city that lives from the water,\\" referring to widely used water power. The glory of the goods of Gabrovo became known throughout the Ottoman Empire, and beyond that, in Bucharest even nowadays there is a street named \\"Gabroveni\\". Shortly before and after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Gabrovo developed as a centre of industry on the basis of its economic traditions. Joint-stock companies emerged, factories were constructed and connections to the large stock exchanges were created, prompting some to label the town \\"The Bulgarian Manchester\\".Gabrovo in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The Bulgarian National Revival church of Gabrovo, an architectural monument. Population Gabrovo saw its most rapid growth in the post-World War II years, when its population was doubled. Following general population trends in Bulgaria, the number of citizens started declining after the fall of Communism in the country. People started emigrating abroad or to the capital of Sofia. Currently, Gabrovo is more than 20,000 people short of its peak, achieved in the period 1985-1991 when the number of the residents exceeded 80,000.

He was the first President of Armenia from 1991 to 1998. A senior researcher at the Matenadaran Institute of Ancient Manuscripts, he led the Karabakh movement for the unification of the Armenian- populated Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia in 1988. After Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ter-Petrosyan was elected president in October 1991 with overwhelming public support. He led the country through the Nagorno- Karabakh War with neighboring Azerbaijan, during which Armenia supported the Republic of Artsakh in fighting against Azerbaijan. He has been accused of rigging the 1996 election, causing thousands to go into the streets to protest the results. The protesters were led by official runner-up Vazgen Manukyan, Ter-Petrosyan's former colleague and his first Prime Minister and later the Defence Minister. The mass rallies were suppressed by military force. Due to disagreements with the key government members, especially Defence Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan, Ter-Petrosyan resigned on 3 February 1998. From his resignation up to 2007, Ter-Petrosyan was inactive in the political scene, however, he made a political comeback in September 2007 and ran for presidency in 2008. He faced one of his former government members, at the time Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan. According to official results, he earned 21.5% of the total vote. Ter-Petrosyan claimed the elections were rigged and led thousands of his supporters into mass protests against the alleged electoral fraud and called for new elections. After a week of mass protests, the government used police and apparently military force to disperse his supporters, resulting in the death of ten people on 1 March 2008. On 1 August 2008, Ter-Petrosyan founded the Armenian National Congress (ANC) which included more than a dozen of political parties and NGOs. Being the main opposition party in Armenia, the ANC was out of the parliament and was mainly involved in street struggle against Serzh Sargsyan's government. They organized mass rallies in the wake of the Arab Spring, forcing the government to grant several political concessions. In the 2012 National Assembly election, the ANC received 7.1% of the popular vote. Early life and education Ter-Petrosyan was born in Aleppo, Syria, to a family which survived the Armenian Genocide and took part in the Musa Dagh Resistance. His family emigrated to Soviet Armenia the same year he was born. In 1968, he graduated from the Oriental Studies Department of the Yerevan State University. In 1972, he completed his postgraduate studies at the Leningrad State University. In 1987, he received his doctoral degree from the same university. In 1972‚Äì78, Ter-Petrosyan worked as junior researcher at the Literature Institute of Armenia named after Manouk Abeghian. From 1978‚Äì85, he held the post of science secretary at Matenadaran named after Saint Mesrob Mashdots. Since 1985, he has worked at Matenadaran as a senior researcher. Scientific career Ter-Petrosyan is fluent in 12 languages: Armenian, Russian, French, English, German, Arabic, Turkish, Assyrian, and several extinct languages (Aramaic, ancient Greek, Latin, ancient Hebrew). He is the author of more than 30 books, about 80 scientific articles in Armenian, Russian and French and thousands of political publications in the multilingual press (speeches, articles, interviews, press conferences, etc.). He is a member of the Writers Union of Armenia, the French Asian Society, the Venice Mkhitarian Academy and a recipient of honorary doctorates from the University of La Verne, University of Sofia, Paris-Sorbonne University and University of Strasbourg. Karabakh movement and independence of Armenia The Karabakh Committee was established on 19 May 1988. Levon Ter-Petrosyan soon became its de facto leader. From 10 December 1988 to 31 May 1989, he was under arrest in Matrosskaya Tishina together with other members of the Karabakh Committee. In 1989, Ter-Petrosyan was elected Member of the Board of the Pan-Armenian National Movement. Later on, he became the Chairman of the Board. On 27 August 1989, he was elected as deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR. He was re-elected as deputy on 20 May 1990. On 4 August of the same year, he became Chairman of the Supreme Council of Armenia. Presidency: 1991‚Äì1998 Inauguration of Ter-Petrosyan as president in 1991. =First term = Ter- Petrosyan was popularly elected the first President of the newly independent Republic of Armenia on 16 October 1991 and re-elected on 22 September 1996. =1996 reelection= His re-election was marred by allegations of electoral fraud reported by the opposition and supported by many international observers. 200,000 people protested the results which gave Ter-Petrosyan just over 50% of the votes. Tanks troops were brought into Yerevan to completely end the protests after 2 politicians were beaten up in the Parliament building by the crowd. On the same day, Defence Minister Vazgen Sargsyan stated that \\"even if they [the opposition] win 100 percent of the votes, neither the Army nor the National Security and Interior Ministry would recognize such political leaders.\\" Ter-Petrosyan's popularity waned further as the opposition started blaming him for the economic quagmire that Armenia's post-Soviet economy was in. Over a year before the election he had also gone on TV and banned the ARF party after detailing an alleged plot hatched by the ARF to engage in terrorism against his administration, endanger Armenia's national security and overthrow the government =Resignation= He was forced to step down in February 1998 after advocating compromised settlement of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh which many Armenians regarded as undermining their security. Ter-Petrosyan's key ministers, led by then-Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan, refused to accept a peace plan for Karabakh put forward by international mediators in September 1997. The plan, accepted by Ter-Petrosyan and Azerbaijan, called for a \\"phased\\" settlement of the conflict which would postpone an agreement on Karabakh's status, the main stumbling block. That agreement was to accompany the return of most Armenian-controlled Azerbaijani territories around Karabakh and the lifting of the Azerbaijani and Turkish blockades of Armenia. When Levon Ter-Petrosyan stepped down from his presidency, he compared himself to the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He stated that the reason he was resigning was to avoid destabilizing the country. Many people in Armenia started wondering if the defeated presidential candidate Vazgen Manukian could stage a comeback. Comeback Since his resignation, Ter-Petrosyan rarely appeared in public and avoided contact with the media, although there were speculations that he would run for the office of president of Armenia in the general election in February 2003. He instead devoted his time to scientific research. In 2005‚Äì07, he published two volumes of his \\"The Crusaders and Armenians\\" historico-political research. =2008 election= On 21 September 2007, Ter-Petrosyan made his first public speech in nearly ten years at an event in Yerevan marking the 16th anniversary of Armenia's declaration of independence. In this speech he was strongly critical of Kocharyan. Subsequently, Ter-Petrosyan officially announced his candidacy in the 2008 presidential election in a speech in Yerevan on 26 October 2007. He accused Kocharyan's government of massive corruption, involving the theft of \\"at least three to four billion dollars\\" over the previous five years. He was critical of the government's claims of strong economic growth and argued that Kocharyan and his Prime Minister, Serge Sargsyan, had come to accept a solution to the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh that was effectively the same solution that he had proposed ten years earlier. A number of opposition parties have rallied behind him since his return to the political arena, including the People's Party of Armenia led by Stepan Demirchian, Armenian Republic Party led by Aram Sargsyan,Emil Danielian and Liz Fuller, \\"Armenian Ex-President Confirms Comeback Plans\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 1 November 2007. Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, \\"Azadakrum\\" movement for Jirair Sefilian, \\"New Times\\" Party and the Heritage Party, led by Raffi Hovannisian.Payqar newspaper  Protests  Final results from the election, which was held on 19 February 2008, officially showed Ter-Petrosyan in second place with 21.5% of the vote. Then he and his supporters accused the government of rigging the election and claimed victory;\\"Armenian opposition candidate accuses prime minister of election violations\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 19 February 2008. beginning on 20 February he led continuous protests involving tens of thousands of his supporters in Yerevan.\\"Thousands challenge victory of Armenian PM in presidential vote in 2nd day of protests\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 21 February 2008. In the early morning hours of 1 March, reportedly acting on evidence of firearms in the camp, the authorities moved in to inspect the tents set up by demonstrators. Law enforcement agents then violently dispersed the hundreds of protestors camped in. Ter-Petrosyan was placed under de facto house arrest, not being allowed to leave his home, though the authorities later denied the allegations.\\"Ter- Petrosian ‚ÄòUnder House Arrest‚Äô, Rally Broken Up\\", Radio Liberty A few hours later, tens of thousands of protestors or more gathered at Myasnikyan Square to protest the government's act. Police, overwhelmed by the sheer size of the crowd, pulled out. A state of emergency was implemented by President Kocharyan at 17:00, allowing the army to be moved into the capital. At night, a few thousand protestors barricaded themselves using commandeered municipal buses. As a result of skirmishes with the police, ten people died.\\"Armenia: Eight Killed After Clashes Between Police, Protesters\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 2 March 2008. Armenian National Congress In 2011, Ter-Petrosyan again took a leading role in protests that erupted in Armenia as part of a wave of regional unrest. As leader of the Armenian National Congress opposition bloc, formed two years prior to the outbreak of protests, Ter- Petrosyan accused President Serzh Sargsyan, elected in the disputed 2008 election, of being \\"illegitimate\\" and called for the release of political prisoners, the resignation of the government, and a full inquiry into the violence that claimed the lives of ten of his supporters in 2008. =2009 Yerevan election= =2012 parliamentary election= Levon Ter-Petrosyan led the Armenian National Congress (ANC) during the 2012 parliamentary election. The ANC won 7.08% (106,903) of the popular vote. =2013 presidential election= The ANC held its convention on 22 December 2012. Ter-Petrosyan talked about groups promoting pro-Western and pro-Russian divisions within the Armenian society and the political parties calling them \\"dangerous forces\\". Ter-Petrosyan did not announce whether he will run for president in February 2013. Few days after the convention on 25 December 2012, Ter-Petrosyan gave Chorrord Inknishkhanutyun an interview eventually declaring his decision not to run for the office. He claimed that \\"dozens of arguments are being put forward by those advocating and opposing my nomination, but the most important argument has been avoided. Can anyone who has respect for his people vie for a presidential post at the age of 68? Such things usually do not happen in developed democratic countries ... everything is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of criminals who have usurped power.\\" The official ANC statement on 27 December 2012 said that they are not participating in the upcoming presidential election in any form. The ANC claimed that the participation in the election is \\"legitimization of the illegal regime.\\" Rumors about Ter- Petrosyan's possible retirement from active politics spread soon after his 25 December announcement. Armenians newspapers argued that Levon Zurabyan, the ANC speaker, could become his successor. On 7 February 2013, Ter-Petrosyan gave another interview to the Chorrord Inknishkhanutyun daily newspaper. He acknowledged that the ANC cannot continue its activities with the same structure. He admitted that the alliance had \\"internal fermentations\\" and called \\"various political forces and non-partisan individuals of the Congress to merge into one single political party.\\" The presidential election was held on 18 February 2013. Voting in a polling station in central Yerevan, Ter- Petrosyan said the journalists he voted for the \\"sake of the Republic of Armenia.\\" According to the official results, incumbent Serzh Sargsyan won with over 58% of the vote. Raffi Hovannisian, the main opposition candidate who earned 37% of the total, claimed victory and started mass protests the next day. On 23 February 2013, Ter-Petrosyan addressed the gathered at the Pan- Armenian National Movement party convention. He claimed Hovannisian won the election and accused incumbent Sargsyan in rigging the election. Talking about Hovannisian's post-election protests, Ter-Petrosyan stated \\"I see words, I see speeches, but there is no action, no plan of actions.\\" On 13 April 2013, the Armenian National Congress was officially transformed from an alliance of 18 original parties into a single party, on the base of the Pan-Armenian National Movement. During his speech at the founding convention, Ter-Petrosyan blamed Hovannisian for having no political agenda in his protests. In particular, Ter-Petrosyan said \\"during the current post-election period we have seen everything but political processes.\\" =2013 Yerevan election= The ANC, now a party rather than an alliance, went to the 2013 Yerevan City Council election alone. Their list was headed by Yerevan's former mayor Vahagn Khachatryan. ANC failed to pass the 6% threshold by gaining only 1.2‚ÑÖ.

Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet. The Internet represents an insecure channel for exchanging information, which leads to a high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing, online viruses, trojans, worms and more. Many methods are used to protect the transfer of data, including encryption and from-the-ground-up engineering. The current focus is on prevention as much as on real time protection against well known and new threats. Threats =Malicious software = An internet user can be tricked or forced into downloading software that is of malicious intent onto a computer. Such software comes in many forms, such as viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, and worms. * Malware, short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. Malware is defined by its malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user, and does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency. The term badware is sometimes used, and applied to both true (malicious) malware and unintentionally harmful software. * A botnet is a network of zombie computers that have been taken over by a robot or bot that performs large-scale malicious acts for the creator of the botnet. * Computer viruses are programs that can replicate their structures or effects by infecting other files or structures on a computer. The common use of a virus is to take over a computer to steal data. * Computer worms are programs that can replicate themselves throughout a computer network, performing malicious tasks throughout. * Ransomware is a type of malware which restricts access to the computer system that it infects, and demands a ransom paid to the creator(s) of the malware in order for the restriction to be removed. * Scareware is scam software of usually limited or no benefit, containing malicious payloads, that is sold to consumers via certain unethical marketing practices. The selling approach uses social engineering to cause shock, anxiety, or the perception of a threat, generally directed at an unsuspecting user. * Spyware refers to programs that surreptitiously monitor activity on a computer system and report that information to others without the user's consent. * One particular kind of spyware is key logging malware. Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard. * A Trojan horse, commonly known as a Trojan, is a general term for malicious software that pretends to be harmless, so that a user will be convinced to download it onto the computer. = Denial-of-service attacks = A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of- service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. Another way of understanding DDoS is seeing it as attacks in cloud computing environment that are growing due to the essential characteristics of cloud computing. Although the means to carry out, motives for, and targets of a DoS attack may vary, it generally consists of the concerted efforts to prevent an Internet site or service from functioning efficiently or at all, temporarily or indefinitely. According to businesses who participated in an international business security survey, 25% of respondents experienced a DoS attack in 2007 and 16.8% experienced one in 2010. DoS attacks often use bots (or a botnet) to carry out the attack. =Phishing= Phishing is an attack which targets online users for extraction of their sensitive information such as username, password and credit card information. Phishing occurs when the attacker pretends to be a trustworthy entity, either via email or web page. Victims are directed to fake web pages, which are dressed to look legitimate, via spoof emails, instant messenger/social media or other avenues. Often tactics such as email spoofing are used to make emails appear to be from legitimate senders, or long complex subdomains hide the real website host. Insurance group RSA said that phishing accounted for worldwide losses of $10.8 billion in 2016. = Application vulnerabilities = Applications used to access Internet resources may contain security vulnerabilities such as memory safety bugs or flawed authentication checks. The most severe of these bugs can give network attackers full control over the computer. Most security applications and suites are incapable of adequate defense against these kinds of attacks. A very and widespread web- browser application vulnerability is the so-called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) vulnerability- for maximum security and privacy, make sure to adopt adequate countermeasures against it (such as the example patches provided for WebKit-based browsers). Countermeasures =Network layer security= TCP/IP protocols may be secured with cryptographic methods and security protocols. These protocols include Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), succeeded by Transport Layer Security (TLS) for web traffic, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for email, and IPsec for the network layer security. = Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) = IPsec is designed to protect TCP/IP communication in a secure manner. It is a set of security extensions developed by the Internet Task Force (IETF). It provides security and authentication at the IP layer by transforming data using encryption. Two main types of transformation that form the basis of IPsec: the Authentication Header (AH) and ESP. These two protocols provide data integrity, data origin authentication, and anti-replay service. These protocols can be used alone or in combination to provide the desired set of security services for the Internet Protocol (IP) layer. The basic components of the IPsec security architecture are described in terms of the following functionalities: *Security protocols for AH and ESP *Security association for policy management and traffic processing *Manual and automatic key management for the Internet key exchange (IKE) *Algorithms for authentication and encryption The set of security services provided at the IP layer includes access control, data origin integrity, protection against replays, and confidentiality. The algorithm allows these sets to work independently without affecting other parts of the implementation. The IPsec implementation is operated in a host or security gateway environment giving protection to IP traffic. =Multi-factor authentication= Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a method of computer access control in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism ‚Äì typically at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inherence (something they are). Internet resources, such as websites and email, may be secured using multi-factor authentication. =Security token= Some online sites offer customers the ability to use a six-digit code which randomly changes every 30‚Äì60 seconds on a security token. The keys on the security token have built in mathematical computations and manipulate numbers based on the current time built into the device. This means that every thirty seconds there is only a certain array of numbers possible which would be correct to validate access to the online account. The website that the user is logging into would be made aware of that device's serial number and would know the computation and correct time built into the device to verify that the number given is indeed one of the handful of six-digit numbers that works in that given 30-60 second cycle. After 30‚Äì60 seconds the device will present a new random six-digit number which can log into the website. =Electronic mail security= Background Email messages are composed, delivered, and stored in a multiple step process, which starts with the message's composition. When the user finishes composing the message and sends it, the message is transformed into a standard format: an RFC 2822 formatted message. Afterwards, the message can be transmitted. Using a network connection, the mail client, referred to as a mail user agent (MUA), connects to a mail transfer agent (MTA) operating on the mail server. The mail client then provides the sender's identity to the server. Next, using the mail server commands, the client sends the recipient list to the mail server. The client then supplies the message. Once the mail server receives and processes the message, several events occur: recipient server identification, connection establishment, and message transmission. Using Domain Name System (DNS) services, the sender's mail server determines the mail server(s) for the recipient(s). Then, the server opens up a connection(s) to the recipient mail server(s) and sends the message employing a process similar to that used by the originating client, delivering the message to the recipient(s).  Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)  Pretty Good Privacy provides confidentiality by encrypting messages to be transmitted or data files to be stored using an encryption algorithm such as Triple DES or CAST-128. Email messages can be protected by using cryptography in various ways, such as the following: :*Signing an email message to ensure its integrity and confirm the identity of its sender. :*Encrypting the body of an email message to ensure its confidentiality. :*Encrypting the communications between mail servers to protect the confidentiality of both message body and message header. The first two methods, message signing and message body encryption, are often used together; however, encrypting the transmissions between mail servers is typically used only when two organizations want to protect emails regularly sent between each other. For example, the organizations could establish a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt the communications between their mail servers over the Internet. Unlike methods that can only encrypt a message body, a VPN can encrypt entire messages, including email header information such as senders, recipients, and subjects. In some cases, organizations may need to protect header information. However, a VPN solution alone cannot provide a message signing mechanism, nor can it provide protection for email messages along the entire route from sender to recipient.  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)  MIME transforms non-ASCII data at the sender's site to Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) ASCII data and delivers it to client's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to be sent through the Internet. The server SMTP at the receiver's side receives the NVT ASCII data and delivers it to MIME to be transformed back to the original non-ASCII data.  Message Authentication Code  A Message authentication code (MAC) is a cryptography method that uses a secret key to digitally sign a message. This method outputs a MAC value that can be decrypted by the receiver, using the same secret key used by the sender. The Message Authentication Code protects both a message's data integrity as well as its authenticity. = Firewalls = A computer firewall controls access between networks. It generally consists of gateways and filters which vary from one firewall to another. Firewalls also screen network traffic and are able to block traffic that is dangerous. Firewalls act as the intermediate server between SMTP and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) connections. Role of firewalls in web security Firewalls impose restrictions on incoming and outgoing Network packets to and from private networks. Incoming or outgoing traffic must pass through the firewall; only authorized traffic is allowed to pass through it. Firewalls create checkpoints between an internal private network and the public Internet, also known as choke points (borrowed from the identical military term of a combat limiting geographical feature). Firewalls can create choke points based on IP source and TCP port number. They can also serve as the platform for IPsec. Using tunnel mode capability, firewall can be used to implement VPNs. Firewalls can also limit network exposure by hiding the internal network system and information from the public Internet. Types of firewall = Packet filter = A packet filter is a first generation firewall that processes network traffic on a packet-by- packet basis. Its main job is to filter traffic from a remote IP host, so a router is needed to connect the internal network to the Internet. The router is known as a screening router, which screens packets leaving and entering the network. = Stateful packet inspection= In a stateful firewall the circuit-level gateway is a proxy server that operates at the network level of an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and statically defines what traffic will be allowed. Circuit proxies will forward Network packets (formatted unit of data ) containing a given port number, if the port is permitted by the algorithm. The main advantage of a proxy server is its ability to provide Network Address Translation (NAT), which can hide the user's IP address from the Internet, effectively protecting all internal information from the Internet. = Application-level gateway = An application-level firewall is a third generation firewall where a proxy server operates at the very top of the OSI model, the IP suite application level. A network packet is forwarded only if a connection is established using a known protocol. Application-level gateways are notable for analyzing entire messages rather than individual packets of data when the data are being sent or received. = Browser choice = Web browser statistics tend to affect the amount a Web browser is exploited. For example, Internet Explorer 6, which used to own a majority of the Web browser market share, is considered extremely insecure because vulnerabilities were exploited due to its former popularity. Internet security products  =Antivirus= Antivirus software and Internet security programs can protect a programmable device from attack by detecting and eliminating malware; Antivirus software was mainly shareware in the early years of the Internet, but there are now several free security applications on the Internet to choose from for all platforms. = Password managers = A password manager is a software application that helps a user store and organize passwords. Password managers usually store passwords encrypted, requiring the user to create a master password; a single, ideally very strong password which grants the user access to their entire password database from top to bottom. =Security suites= So called security suites were first offered for sale in 2003 (McAfee) and contain a suite of firewalls, anti-virus, anti-spyware and more. They also offer theft protection, portable storage device safety check, private Internet browsing, cloud anti-spam, a file shredder or make security-related decisions (answering popup windows) and several were free of charge. History In 1972, Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla filed for a remote PIN verification system, which utilized encryption techniques to assure telephone link security while entering personal ID information, which would be transmitted as encrypted data over telecommunications networks to a remote location for verification. This was a precursor to Internet security and e-commerce. At the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks (NAMSB) conference in January 1976, Atalla Corporation (founded by Mohamed Atalla) and Bunker Ramo Corporation (founded by George Bunker and Simon Ramo) introduced the earliest products designed for dealing with online security. Atalla announced an upgrade to its Identikey hardware security module, called the Interchange Identikey. It added the capabilities of processing online transactions and dealing with network security. Designed with the focus of taking bank transactions online, the Identikey system was extended to shared-facility operations. It was consistent and compatible with various switching networks, and was capable of resetting itself electronically to any one of 64,000 irreversible nonlinear algorithms as directed by card data information. The Interchange Identikey device was released in March 1976. In 1979, Atalla introduced the first network security processor (NSP).

History Early period During the Edo period, almost all of the area present-day Ch≈çsei District was tenry≈ç territory under direct control of the central government and administered by various hatamoto, with the exception of Ichinomiya, most of which was under the rule of Ichinomiya Domain, a minor feudal domain of the Tokugawa shogunate ruled by the Kano clan. Modern period Ch≈çsei District was created on April 1, 1889 out of the merger of the short-lived early Meiji period districts of Nagara (3 towns, 17 villages) and Kamihabu (1 town, five villages). The administrative seat of the district was located in Mobara. Ch≈çsei District, since its creation, has seen extensive administrative reorganization. Shirakata Village was elevated to town status on February 11, 1940. Mobara was elevated to city status on April 1, 1952, and ceased to be part of Ch≈çsei District. Tait≈ç merged with Furusawa in Isumi District, and ceased to be part of Ch≈çsei District. Nagara was raised to town status on April 29, 1955, and Honn≈ç merged into the city of Mobara on May 1, 1972. Mutsuzawa was raised to town status on April 1, 1983. The district now consists of five towns and one village. A plan to merge the municipalities of Ch≈çsei District into the city of Mobara, and thus dissolve the district, was discussed beginning in 2002. The planning committee of 2002 failed to reach a consensus, as did the planning committee of 2004. A new planning committee, the was formed in 2007, but was dissolved after one year. Economy The coastal areas of Ch≈çsei District once depended on the fishing industry, but fishing in the district has been in long decline. The district has extensive greenhouse fruit and vegetable production. The mountainous areas of Nagara, Chonan, and Mutsuzawa were once major agricultural centers, but the district's proximity to the Keiy≈ç Industrial Zone has transformed agricultural areas into centers of small-scale industry and housing complexes.

The total area the town is , making it the largest of Chiba Prefecture's towns and villages.  Etymology  The name of the town of ≈åtaki in the Japanese language is composed of three kanji characters: the first, ≈ç (Â§ß), meaning \\"large\\", the second, ta (Â§ö), meaning \\"many\\", and the third, ki (Âñú), meaning \\"happiness\\". Geography ≈åtaki is a landlocked town in the center of the B≈çs≈ç Peninsula. The southwest area of Otaki is mountainous, with altitudes gradually lowering towards the northeast of the town. 70% of ≈åtaki is covered by forest. The Isumi River flows through the town to the northeast, and in the western part of the town the Y≈çr≈ç River flows to the north. =Surrounding municipalities= Chiba Prefecture * Ichihara * Kimitsu * Katsuura * Kamogawa * Isumi * Mutsuzawa * Ch≈çnan History =Early history= ≈åtaki was settled in prehistoric times, as evidenced by the J≈çmon period remains in Oikawa. In the Asuka period the ≈åtaki region became part of Kazusa Province at the western end of the T≈çkaid≈ç region, which was formed as a result of the Taika Reform of 654. In the Sengoku period ≈åtaki was established as a castle town, which successively controlled by different regional clans, most notably the Takeda clan and the Toki clan. The ≈åtaki region ultimately came under the control of the powerful Awa Province-based Satomi clan in 1544. =Edo Period= In 1590 Tokugawa Ieyasu took control of all of Kazusa Province. Ieyasu granted ≈åtaki to his famed general Honda Tadakatsu, and established the ≈åtaki Domain as a 100,000 koku feudal domain. Tadakatsu built ≈åtaki Castle on the site of the earlier castle and laid out a large-scale castle town. Honda Tadakatsu's placement at ≈åtaki was a strong buffer against the military power of the Satomi clan to the south. The ownership of the castle changed hands many times after Honda Tadakatsu's control, but from 1703 the Matsudaira clan held the castle for nine generations. Despite the Matsudaira clan's control of the castle, the majority of the ≈åtaki region was controlled as tenry≈ç territory by hatamoto in direct service to the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1609 a Spanish galleon, the San Francisco, ran aground near ≈åtaki . The survivors were housed in ≈åtaki Castle, and later, the sailors were given a ship by the shogunate to return to Mexico. One of the survivors was Governor General of the Philippines Rodrigo de Vivero, who was subsequently granted an audience with sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (2010) Japan-Mexico Relations =Modern Period= After the Meiji Restoration the administrative structure of the region changed frequently. ≈åtaki was successively part of ≈åtaki Prefecture, then Kisarazu Prefecture, before becoming part of the present-day Chiba Prefecture. In 1889, under the same administrative reforms, the four villages of Oikawa, Nishihata, Fusamoto, Kamitaki and the town of ≈åtaki were formed. The five were brought together to become present-day town of ≈åtaki on October 5, 1954. ≈åtaki Town Hall Economy The economy of ≈åtaki was based largely on rice production, forestry, and traditional charcoal production, but after World War II all three industries have declined. The town produces shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoots as special agricultural products. Tourism has increased as a result of visits to ≈åtaki Castle, the ≈åtaki Prefectural Forest, and various scenic spots. Golf courses were developed in ≈åtaki, but have caused problems with flooding and deforestation.

However, if the previous Date Line were followed, the easternmost point would be Tafahi Niuatoputapu, in the Tonga Islands chain. =Elevation= Highest points Chimborazo in Ecuador is the farthest point from Earth's centre. * The highest point on Earth's surface measured from sea level is the summit of Mount Everest on the border of Nepal and China. While measurements of its height vary slightly, the elevation of its peak is usually given as above sea level. It was first reached by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Sherpa of Nepal Tenzing Norgay in 1953. * The point farthest from Earth's centre is the summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador, at from Earth's centre; the peak's elevation relative to sea level is . This is because Earth is an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere; it is wider at the Equator and narrower between the poles. Therefore, the summit of Chimborazo, which is near the Equator, is farther away from Earth's centre than the summit of Mount Everest is; the latter is closer, at from Earth's centre. Peru's Huascar√°n (at ) contends closely with Chimborazo, the difference in the mountains' heights being just . * The fastest point on Earth or, in other words, the point furthest from the axis of Earth is the summit of Cayambe in Ecuador, at and from the axis. Like Chimborazo, which is the fourth fastest peak at , it is close to the Equator and takes advantage of the oblate spheroid figure of Earth. More importantly, however, it being so near the Equator means that the majority of its distance from Earth's centre goes into it being away from the axis. =Highest points attainable by transportation= * The highest point accessible... **...by land vehicle is an elevation of on Ojos del Salado in Chile, which was reached by the Chilean duo of Gonzalo and Eduardo Canales Moya on 21 April 2007 with a modified Suzuki Samurai, setting the high-altitude record for a four-wheeled vehicle. ** ...by road (dead end) is on a mining road to the summit of Aucanquilcha in Chile, which reaches an elevation of .

A very large and high river is the Yarlung Tsangpo or upper Brahmaputra River in Tibet, whose main stem, the Maquan River, has its source at about above sea level at . Above these elevations, there are no constantly flowing rivers since the temperature is almost always below freezing. * The highest island is one of a number of islands in the Orba Co lake in Tibet, at an elevation of . Lowest points =Lowest artificial points= * The lowest point underground ever reached was deep (SG-3 at the Kola Superdeep Borehole). * The lowest human-sized point underground is below ground at the TauTona Mine, Carletonville, South Africa. * The lowest (from sea level) artificially made point with open sky may be the Hambach surface mine, Germany, which reaches a depth of below sea level. * The lowest (from surface) artificially made point with open sky may be the Bingham Canyon open-pit mine, Salt Lake City, United States, at a depth of below surface level. *The lowest point underwater is the -deep (as measured from the subsea wellhead) oil and gas well drilled on the Tiber Oil Field in the Gulf of Mexico. The wellhead of this well was an additional underwater for a total distance of as measured from sea level. =Lowest natural points= * The lowest known point is Challenger Deep, at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, below sea level. Only six humans have reached the bottom of the trench: Jacques Piccard and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh in 1960 aboard the bathyscaphe Trieste, filmmaker James Cameron in 2012 aboard Deepsea Challenger, as well as Victor Vescovo, Patrick Lahey, and Jonathan Struwe aboard the DSV Limiting Factor in 2019. * The lowest point underground is more than under the Earth's surface. For example, the altitude difference between the entrance and the deepest explored point (the maximum depth) of the Krubera Cave in Georgia is . In 2012, Ukrainian cave diver Gennadiy Samokhin reached the lowest point, breaking the world record. * The lowest point on land not covered by liquid water is the canyon under Denman Glacier in Antarctica, with the bedrock being below sea level. The shore of the Dead Sea in Israel * The lowest point on dry land is the shore of the Dead Sea, shared by Israel, Palestine, and Jordan, below sea level. As the Dead Sea waters are receding, the water surface level drops more than 1 m per year. * The point on the surface closest to the Earth's centre (interpreted as a natural surface of the land or sea that is accessible by a person) is the surface of the Arctic Ocean at the Geographic North Pole (). ** The closest point on the ground (interpreted as a land surface or sea floor) is the bottom of the Litke Deep, which is from the centre of the Earth. By comparison, the bottom of the deepest oceanic trench in the world, the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean, is farther from the centre of the Earth. =Lowest points attainable by transportation= * The lowest point accessible... ** ...by road, excluding roads in mines, is any of the roads alongside the Dead Sea in Israel and Jordan, which are the lowest on Earth at below sea level. *** The lowest undersea highway tunnel is the Eiksund Tunnel, in Norway, at below sea level. ** ...by train, excluding the tracks inside some South African gold mines, which can be several thousand metres below sea level, is located in the Seikan Tunnel of Japan railroad, at below sea level. For comparison, the undersea Channel Tunnel between England and France reaches a depth of below sea level. * The lowest railroad station was the Japanese Yoshioka-Kaitei Station, at below sea level, but it closed in 2014. The lowest railroad station not inside a tunnel is below sea level, at Beit She'an railway station in Israel. * The lowest airfield is the Bar Yehuda Airfield, near Masada, Israel, at below sea level. * The lowest international airport is Atyrau Airport, near Atyrau, Kazakhstan, at below sea level, in the basin of the Caspian Sea. =Lowest cities= Baku, Azerbaijan is located below sea level, which makes it the lowest-lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. =Remoteness= Poles of inaccessibility Each continent has its own continental pole of inaccessibility, defined as the place on the continent that is farthest from any ocean. Similarly, each ocean has its own oceanic pole of inaccessibility, defined as the place in the ocean that is farthest from any land. =Continental= * The most distant point from an ocean is the Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility (or \\"EPIA\\") , in China's Xinjiang region near the border with Kazakhstan. Calculations have shown that this point, located in the Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert, is from the nearest coastline. The nearest settlement to the EPIA is Suluk at , about to the east. A 2007 study suggests that the historical calculation of the EPIA failed to recognize the point where the Gulf of Ob joins the Arctic Ocean, and proposes instead that varying definitions of coastline could result in other locations for the EPIA: ** EPIA1, somewhere between and , is about from the nearest ocean. ** EPIA2, somewhere between and , is about from the nearest ocean. :If adopted, this would place the final EPIA roughly closer to the ocean than the point that is currently agreed upon. Coincidentally, EPIA1, or EPIA2, and the most remote of the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility (specifically, the point in the South Pacific Ocean that is farthest from land) are similarly remote; EPIA1 is less than closer to the ocean than the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility is to land. * The continental poles of inaccessibility for the other continents are as follows: ** Africa: , close to the tripoint of the Central African Republic, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ** Australia: either ,Centre of Australia, States and Territories , Geoscience Australia or , near Papunya, Northern Territory ** North America: , between Kyle, South Dakota and Allen, South Dakota, United States. ** South America: , near Aren√°polis, Mato Grosso, Brazil =Oceanic= * The most distant point from land is the Pacific pole of inaccessibility (also called \\"Point Nemo\\"), which lies in the South Pacific Ocean at , approximately from the nearest land (equidistant from Ducie Island in the Pitcairn Islands to the north, Motu Nui off Rapa Nui to the northeast, and Maher Island off Siple Island near Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica, to the south). Other places considered the most remote Bouvet Island * The most remote island is Bouvet Island, a small, uninhabited island in the South Atlantic Ocean that is a dependency of Norway. It lies at coordinates . The nearest land is the uninhabited Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, over to the south. The nearest inhabited lands are Gough Island, away, Tristan da Cunha, away, and the coast of South Africa, away. * The title for most remote inhabited island or archipelago (the farthest away from any other permanently inhabited place) depends on how the question is interpreted. If the south Atlantic island Tristan da Cunha (population about 300) and its dependency Gough Island (with a small staffed research post), which are from each other, are considered part of the same archipelago, or if Gough Island is not counted because it has no permanent residents, then Tristan da Cunha is the world's most remote inhabited island/archipelago: the main island, also called Tristan da Cunha, is from the island Saint Helena, from South Africa, and from South America. It is away from uninhabited Bouvet Island. However, if Gough and Tristan da Cunha are considered separately, they disqualify each other, and the most remote inhabited island is Easter Island in the South Pacific Ocean, which lies from Pitcairn Island (about 50 residents in 2013), from Rikitea on the island of Mangareva (the nearest town with a population over 500), and from the coast of Chile (the nearest continental point and the country of which Easter Island is part). The Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean are another contender, lying from the small Alfred Faure scientific station in √éle de la Possession, but otherwise more than from the coast of Madagascar (the nearest permanently inhabited place), northwest of the uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands (both a part of Australia), and from the non-permanent scientific station located in √éle Amsterdam. * The most remote city... ** ...with a population in excess of one million from the nearest city with a population in excess of one million is Auckland, New Zealand.

The nearest city of comparable size or greater is San Francisco, away. ** ...that is a national capital from the nearest national capital is a tie between Wellington, New Zealand, and Canberra, Australia, which are apart from each other. * The most remote airport in the world from another airport is Mataveri International Airport (IPC) on Easter Island, which has a single runway for military and public use. It is located from Totegegie Airport (GMR; very few flights) in the Gambier Islands, French Polynesia and from Santiago, Chile (SCL; a fairly large airport). In comparison, the airport at the Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station (NZSP) is not very remote at all, being located only from Williams Field (NZWD) near Ross Island.

As of December 1, 2015, the town had an estimated population of 7,429, and a population density of 299 persons per km2. The total area is . The name of the town is made of two kanji characters: the first meaning \\"honorable\\", and the second meaning \\"residence\\". Geography Onjuku is located on the east coast of southern Chiba Prefecture in approximately the center of the outer coast of the B≈çs≈ç Peninsula. The landscape consists of rolling, sandy hills of the B≈çs≈ç Hill Range, and the town is noted for its beach resorts. Its broad beaches are protected as part of the Minami B≈çs≈ç Quasi-National Park. Onjuku is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east, and enjoys a temperate maritime climate, with short, cool winters and hot, humid summers due to the effects of the Kuroshio Current offshore. Onjuku faces Ajiro Bay, which has two functional ports: the Port of Iwawada to the north, and the Port of Onjuku to the south. One small river, the Kiyomizu River, flows through the town to Ajiro Bay. =Surrounding municipalities= Chiba Prefecture *Isumi (to the west and north) *Katsuura (to the south) History =Early history= Onjuku is part of ancient Kazusa Province. The pines and sand of Ajiro Bay in Onjuku were referenced in a poem by H≈çj≈ç Tokiyori (1227‚Äì1263), a Kamakura-period administrator. =Edo Period= Onjuku, from the Muromachi to the Edo period, was divided into a complex mixture of administrative areas. Much of the town was tenry≈ç territory ruled by various hatamoto on behalf of the Sh≈çgun. The town was typically associated with administrators from the ≈åtaki and Iwatsuki domains. In the Edo period a prominent ‚Äúrokusai‚Äôichi‚Äù (ÂÖ≠ÊñéÂ∏Ç) market, or open-air market held on fixed days six times a month, developed in Onjuku. =Landing of Rodrigo de Vivero= In 1609 a Spanish galleon, the San Francisco, ran aground near Onjuku. The captain and 300 survivors were cared for by the town, and later, the sailors were given a ship by the Tokugawa shogunate to return to Mexico. One of the survivors was Governor General of the Philippines Rodrigo de Vivero, who was subsequently granted an audience with sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (2010) Japan-Mexico Relations In 1928 a tower was built in Onjuku to commemorate the landing of Rodrigo and friendly relations between Mexico, Spain, and Japan. It has since been designated an Important Prefectural Monument (), and is surrounded by an extensive garden complex. =Current administration= The village of Onjuku was created on April 1, 1889 with the early Meiji period establishment of the municipalities system, and was elevated to town status on April 1, 1914. The town expanded through annexation of areas of the neighboring villages of Fuse and Namihana on March 1, 1955. Economy The economy of Onjuku is dominated by summer tourism and commercial fishing; agriculture plays a relatively small role in the economy compared to nearby municipalities. Commercial coastal and off-shore fishing operations are active, with squid and bonito being the most important catches. Ama, or traditional women divers, gather abalone, turban shell (sazae), and spiny lobster, all important parts of the traditional Japanese diet. The sandy beaches of Onjuku are the representative swimming areas of the Sotob≈çs≈ç Coast and attract numerous tourists during the summer months. Tourism in the town began in the Meiji period, and development of the tourism industry continues. Numerous guests houses, ryokan (traditional Japanese inns), and hotels have developed in the area. Education Onjuku has two elementary schools and one middle school, but no high school. Sports Due to the infrastructure and sandy beach with good surf conditions, the locality holds the yearly national surf carnival of the Japan Lifesaving Association, in which surf lifesavers gather from all clubs over the country. In 2013, the worldwide 2013 International Surf Rescue Challenge is held here.

Towns and villages *Onjuku *≈åtaki History =Early history= Isumi District was one of the ancient districts of Kazusa Province. The district was named after the Isumi River, which runs from the mountainous areas of Katsuura to the south of Kuj≈´kuri Beach on the Pacific Ocean. The district is mentioned in Nara-period chronicles under various names, usually as . The Nihon Shoki records the area as , and the Kojiki as . In the ancient period the district bordered M≈çda and Unakami districts to the west, and Habu and Nagara districts to the north. In the Heian period (794‚Äì1185) the district was divided into two sh≈çen estates; one to the north, and one to the south. Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147‚Äì1199) drew soldiers from both sh≈çen estates with the assistance of the local warlord Kazusa Hirotsune (?‚Äì1184). Yoritomo went on to found the Kamakura Shogunate. Manki Castle and ≈åtaki Castle were built in this period. Kuniyoshi, once a village and now part of Isumi City, became a noted market town in this period, and a rokusai-ichi, or market held six days of the month, is held to this day. By the end of the Sengoku period (1467‚Äì1573) the district had been variously controlled by the Toki, H≈çj≈ç, and Satomi clans. The Satomi ceded the area to Oda Nobunaga (1534‚Äì1582) in 1590. =Edo period= The name of Isumi District was standardized to its present kanji and pronunciation by the Edo period. Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543‚Äì1616), as part of the wider unification of Japan, entered the Kant≈ç region in 1590 and awarded the Isumi District to a trusted general Honda Tadakatsu (1548‚Äì1610). Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the minor feudal domain of ≈åtaki Domain, controlled by Honda Tadakatsu from ≈åtaki Castle, controlled 18 villages within the district, with another 57 villages under the control of other domains (including one village belonging to Nitta Domain in Tosa Province). The remaining 108 villages were tenry≈ç under direct control of the central government and administered by various hatamoto, or samurai in the direct service of the Tokugawa shogunate. The Edo period was marked by the extensive development of rice paddy land in the district. =Modern period= In the post Meiji Restoration cadastral reform, the area came under the control of Chiba Prefecture and on April 1, 1889 was divided into two towns (≈åtaki and Asahi) and 21 villages. Katsuura was elevated to town status on March 12, 1890, Kuniyoshi (future Ch≈çjamachi) on September 22, 1893, ≈åhara on December 2, 1899, Onjuku on April 1, 1914, and Okitsu on January 1, 1921. The town of Isumi was created on April 29, 1954 through the merger of Ch≈çjamachi with neighboring villages, and the town of Tait≈ç was created in December of the same year. Katsuura was elevated to city status on October 1, 1958. Tait≈ç and Ch≈çjamachi merged to form the town of Misaki on August 1, 1961, leaving the district with five towns. On December 5, 2005 the towns of Isumi, Misaki and ≈åhara merged to form the city of Isumi, leave the district with only two remaining towns.

The city is about southeast of Yangon. Its population (2014 estimate) is 146,964. Dawei is a port at the head of the Dawei River estuary, . from the Andaman Sea. As a result, the city is prone to flooding during the monsoon season. \\"Dawei\\" is also the name of one of Myanmar's 135 ethnic minorities. Etymology Dawei derives from the Mon language term hawai (; ), which means 'to sit cross- legged', in reference to the Buddha's sitting posture on the palin (throne). History The area around the Dawei River estuary has been inhabited for centuries by Dawei, Mon, Kayin, and Thai mariners. As the ancient site, Sagara City, old Dawei, which is approx 6 miles north of present city, has so many traces of Pyu Culture, it was recognized as one of the province capital in ancient Pyu era. From the 11th to 13th centuries, Dawei was part of the Pagan Empire. From 1287 to 1564, Dawei became part of the Sukhothai Kingdom and its successor Ayutthaya Kingdom (Siam). From 1564 to 1594, Dawei was part of the Toungoo Kingdom of Burma. Siam temporarily regained the city between 1594 and 1614. From 1614 to the 1740s, Dawei was the southernmost city under Burmese authority, and was defended by a Burmese garrison. In the late-1740s, during the Burmese civil war of 1740‚Äì1757, Dawei, along with the northern Tenasserim coast, was taken over by Siam. Burma regained the city in 1760, and extended its control over the entire Tenasserim coast in 1765. The Tenasserim coast was ceded to the British after the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824‚Äì1826). After independence in 1948, the city became part of the Tenasserim Division, which also included today's Mon State. In 1974, Mon State was carved out of Tenasserim and Dawei became the capital of the truncated division. In 1989, the city's English name was changed from Tavoy to Dawei, and Tenasserim became Tanintharyi. Climate Dawei features an extreme tropical monsoon climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Am), similar to Sittwe further north-west. There is a substantial dry season from November to March, but in the wet season the influence of local mountains causes Dawei to receive as much as precipitation per month. Apart from the Choc√≥ region of Colombia, and the area around Mount Cameroon in Africa, it is possibly the wettest lowland tropical region in the world. Transport Dawei Airport Only recently was Dawei connected to the rest of Myanmar by road and rail. A transnational highway and a railway line across the Tenasserim Hills connecting Dawei and Bangkok are planned if a proposed deep water port project goes ahead. This port could significantly reduce Singapore-bound traffic when completed. Dawei Airport The airport serves as the domestic airport for the city of Dawei and the neighbouring towns. The government plans to upgrade the air port for the hub of tourism. Dawei Railway Station It is the southernmost station and termination in Myanmar. Economy There are plans to construct a deep water port in Dawei. In November 2010, the Myanmar Port Authority signed a US$8.6 billion deal with Italian-Thai Development to develop the seaport at Dawei. The Dawei Special Economic Zone would become Myanmar's first special economic zone (SEZ), which includes plans to develop a industrial estate, with sea, land (railway and road) infrastructure links to Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, as well as a gas pipeline to Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province and commercial and residential developments. The development of the SEZ has been linked to land confiscations and land grabs from farmers of upwards of (direct) and , potentially displacing 500,000 Dawei natives. The project has been opposed by a significant portion of the local ethnic population. Dawei longyis (sarong) are one of the area's well-known products. The area produces rubber, dried fish, and teakwood. It also produces cashew nuts and betel nuts and exports them through local traders to China, India, and Thailand. Dawei is also known for its variety of tropical fruits such as pineapples, a variety of mangoes, mangosteens, and durian. There is one fruit called zin thi (in Dawei language), which can only be found in Dawei and surrounding areas.

The first of the river are all located within the borders of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The remaining flow out of the mountains through Blount County to join the Tennessee River at Fort Loudon Lake in Knox County. History, Course & Geology =Source to Elkmont= Little River at Three Forks, a mile or so below its source Little River rises in Sevier County inside the national park on the north slope of Clingmans Dome, the highest point in Tennessee. Clingmans Dome is located directly on the Tennessee-North Carolina state line, which parallels the Appalachian Trail along the crest of the Smokies. Approximately one mile below its source, Little River absorbs several smaller streams at an area known as \\"Three Forks\\", where the river gains considerable strength. From here, the river is paralleled by the well-maintained Little River Trail which leads into Elkmont. Located in a valley created by Little River's confluence with Jakes Creek, Elkmont was originally a logging camp for the Little River Lumber Company and a station on the Little River Railroad. In the 1920s a series of cabins and inholdings, including the Wonderland Hotel, were leased to private citizens. The leases remained intact until 2001, when the last lease expired. The road improves at Elkmont to become one which is easily suitable for most vehicles. This section of the river is navigable by expert kayak and canoe enthusiasts and offers excellent fishing for native brook trout. =Elkmont to the Townsend Y= From just below Elkmont, the Little River runs parallel to State Route 73, also known as Little River Gorge Road, which connects the two major Tennessee entrances to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park: those in Gatlinburg and Townsend. The stream, like the road that follows it, is quite sinuous. The road is built on the bed of the Little River Railroad that was used for logging purposes prior to the establishment of the park. Little River at Metcalf Bottoms Along the course of Little River are several small waterfalls which feed into the river, which are especially strong during wet weather. One waterfall, Meigs Falls, is visible from the road and is provided with a parking turnout. Additionally, there are parking turnouts for trails leading to numerous places. About midway between Gatlinburg and Townsend, Little River enters a relatively flat area known as Metcalf Bottoms, which developed along an oasis of soft phyllite amidst the more predominant sandstone. The park service has established a picnic area at Metcalf Bottoms, providing an attractive area for summer picnics and wading. Just past Metcalf Bottoms, Little River becomes more rapid and volatile as it slices through Little River Gorge, a narrow valley between Round Top Mountain and Curry She Mountain. Among the gorge's more notable landmarks is an area known as \\"The Sinks.\\" The Sinks is where the river flows over a ten-foot (three meters) waterfall into a large pool, and then seems to disappear for a small distance. (Unlike streams in a limestone area, which may actually \\"sink\\" for a considerable distance, this is more a question of appearance than of the stream truly \\"sinking\\", which is not feasible in this area of ancient Precambrian metamorphic rock.) Below the Sinks, Little River is navigable in high water with a canoe or kayak. Continuing to follow TN 73 the stream crosses into Blount County en route to its confluence with Middle Prong of Little River at an area known as the \\"Townsend Y\\". =The Middle Prong= Lynn Camp Prong, just above its confluence with Thunderhead Prong The Middle Prong of Little River drains the watershed between Miry Ridge and Defeat Ridge, both of which descend from the crest of the Smokies. The Middle Prong is formed by the confluence of Lynn Camp Prong and Thunderhead Prong at the former logging town of Tremont, where it has cut a deep gorge. From here, the river continues northward, absorbing Spruce Flats Branch and several smaller streams before steadying in a relatively flat area known as Walker Valley. The Middle Prong is shadowed by the old roadbed of the Little River Railroad for almost all of its nine-mile (14 km) length. Laurel Creek, which drains the White Oak Sink area, joins the West Prong, which drains the area beneath Spence Field. The West Prong then joins the Middle Prong a mile east of the Townsend Wye at the junction of Tremont Road and Laurel Creek Road. Only the stream below the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont is navigable by kayak in high water. Fishing along Middle Prong is considered excellent. =Townsend Wye to Walland= The Townsend Wye, created as Little River (top right) absorbs Middle Prong (bottom) and turns north (left) The Townsend 'Y' is created by the confluence of Little River (flowing from the east) and Middle Prong of Little River (flowing from the west), which create a powerful stream that flows north. The Townsend Y is a popular swimming hole in the summer and is generally packed with cars and people. Many tubers use the Y as the jumping off point for a mile long float down the river. Just past the Y, Little River exits the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into Tuckaleechee Cove and Townsend. From this point forward, with the exception of two old mill dams, the Little River can be navigated in a kayak at normal water levels. Tubers typically travel from the Townsend Y to the vicinity of the first mill dam (above the Highway 321 bridge). This portion of the river has intermittent rapids and swimming areas, as well as large rocks in the middle of the river (such as Gallaher Rock near Cedar Bluff Way) that are suitable to rest at. In Townsend, the river is paralleled by U.S. Highway 321. Townsend is situated in Tuckaleechee Cove, a Paleozoic limestone area noted by the presence of Tuckaleechee Caverns, a large cave operated as a tourist attraction during the tourist season, roughly defined as April to October. The drainage from the cave enters the Little River just below Townsend. Townsend is laid out in the cove along the Little River valley. Three decades ago it was largely undeveloped, with a few small \\"mom and pop\\" style hotels and restaurants; now major chains have built larger lodging facilities, although not yet comparable to Gatlinburg or Pigeon Forge. Of interest are the Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum and the Greenway that parallels U.S 321. The Townsend area was once the site of many scenic swinging bridges over Little River; liability concerns have caused most of these to be dismantled in recent years. One bridge does remain, however, at the northern end of Townsend in an area known as Kinzel Springs. A second swinging bridge is located near the LRRR&LC; Museum and connects to Dark Island. Little River continues to flow north through Miller Cove into the small community of Walland, which is at the current time the eastern terminus of the Chilhowee section of Foothills Parkway, a national parkway. =Walland to Fort Loudon Lake= Rockford Beyond Walland, Little River cuts a wide gap in Chilhowee Mountain before descending into the Maryville-Alcoa flatlands. As it steadies, the river no longer displays the extreme clarity and attractive rocky bottom of its upper reaches and resembles a more typical stream in a moderately rolling, somewhat rural area.

Loudoun Lake (approximately 19 miles), the river is generally navigable with a canoe, with the exception of a dangerous low-head dam at the Rockford Manufacturing Company in Rockford.\\"Accident #113,\\" American Whitewater Accident Database. Accessed: 3 September 2013. Little River flows through farmland, under U.S. Highway 411, and passes through the cities of Maryville and Alcoa before reaching Rockford. Approximately 85,000 residents of these communities draw drinking water from the river. Three creeks-- Pistol Creek, Short Creek and Crooked Creek-- join Little River in this area. These three creeks are considered \\"impaired\\", contributing to a designation of Little River as \\"threatened\\" by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Little River flows into a surprisingly large (given the size of the stream) embayment of the Fort Loudon Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River along U.S. Highway 129, where a small marina is located.

It was formed in 1996 specifically to be a contender for the Ansari X Prize for the first non- governmental reusable manned spacecraft. The project was based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and led by Brian Feeney. The original da Vinci Project is no longer operating. A documentary was filmed throughout much of the project's life from 2000 through post-X Prize roundup footage in 2008. The documentary accumulated some 1000 hours or so of footage. It was a private undertaking by Michel Jones of Riverstone Productions, Toronto, and as of early 2009 was still in a preliminary stage of editing and completion. The project last participated in the X Prize Cup 2005, displaying a mock-up of its Wild Fire MK Vl spacecraft. Spacecraft design The project's design was a rocket-powered spacecraft to be air-launched from a helium balloon at an altitude of about 21 km (65,000 ft). The project scope included design and construction of both the spacecraft and the launching balloon. The chosen design can be described as a manned rockoon. History and status The project was established in 1996. It is named after Leonardo da Vinci, who, among innumerable other inventions, was the first recorded person to design an aircraft. The project was staffed entirely by volunteers. The project unveiled a mockup of their spacecraft, Wild Fire, on August 5, 2004 at a hangar at Downsview Airport in Toronto. At this point, it was considered a contender for the Ansari X Prize , and Tier One had just given notice of their planned competitive flights. When announcing the unveiling, the da Vinci Project also appealed for funds to fly Wild Fire. An agreement was reached with GoldenPalace.com, and the project subsequently gave the required 60-day notice that they would make the Ansari X Prize competitive flights. GoldenPalace.com, known for its marketing gimmicks, was to place a soccer ball kicked out of the stadium by David Beckham during the 2004 Euro World Cup inside the space craft. The da Vinci Project initially announced that it would fly first on October 2, 2004, launching from Kindersley, Saskatchewan. This was only three days after the first expected X Prize flight, by Scaled Composites, on September 29, 2004. However, on September 23, 2004 the da Vinci project announced that they would not be ready. Scaled Composites won the X Prize on October 4, 2004. Hardware The rocket and support equipment was mostly COTS components with a hybrid propulsion system using nitrous oxide and a spin cast paraffin fuel engine in a re-loadable and expendable cardboard cartridge. The most notable development problem was finding a practical low cost solution to the thermal contraction of the liquid paraffin fuel when it cooled and solidified inside the cartridge inner casing. The capsule used two automotive racing seats and aviation BRS parachute systems and was designed and modeled with finite element software. The nozzle was carbon fiber exterior with a tough, thermally insulating inner coating. The combustion chamber was metallic, although a wound carbon fiber exterior was planned but never completed. The planned tracking system used a four car team with networked laptop computers using a hybrid cellular and shortwave radio with the capability of automatically predicting the landing spot so a support team could converge on the landing spot hand prior to landing. The highest forces were predicted to be at re-entry, peaking at approximately at up to 6G. Development, construction and testing continued in earnest until the second flight of the X Prize on October 4, 2004. Structure The project had a small group of core area leaders and relied heavily on volunteer efforts. It followed a variety of business models including share ownership partners, technology partnerships, employee style volunteering, integrator as well as technology/IP aggregator. Many of the expensive components were donated by businesses in exchange for recognition on the website homepage, since removed.

Although a tenant does hold rights to real property, a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property. Leasehold is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the right to occupy land or a building for a given length of time. As lease is a legal estate, leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market. A leasehold thus differs from a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a property is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length of time, and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let (rented) on a periodic basis such as weekly or monthly. Terminology and types of leasehold vary from country to country. Sometimes, but not always, a residential tenancy under a lease agreement is colloquially known as renting. The leaseholder has the right to remain in occupation for a fixed period, generally measured in months or years. Terms of the agreement are contained in a lease, which has elements of contract and property law intertwined.  History  Laws governing landlord-tenant relationships can be found as far back as the Code of Hammurabi. However, the common law of the landlord-tenant relation evolved in England during the Middle Ages. That law still retains many archaic terms and principles pertinent to a feudal social order and an agrarian economy, where land was the primary economic asset and ownership of land was the primary source of rank and status. See also Lord of the Manor. Tenancy was essential to the feudal hierarchy; a lord would own land and the tenants became vassals. Leasehold estates can still be Crown land today. For example, in the Australian Capital Territory, all private land \\"ownerships\\" are actually leaseholds of Crown land. Contemporary practice =Australia= Leasehold land Leasehold land is a land holding leased to a person or company by the relevant state (as the Crown); however, all mineral rights are reserved to the Crown. There are different types of leasehold tenure from state to state. Pastoral leases cover about 44% of mainland Australia, mostly in arid and semi-arid regions and the tropical savannahs. There are three types of leasehold tenure in Australia: *Term lease ‚Äì usually 1‚Äì50 years, for a specified purpose. *Perpetual lease, or lease in perpetuity ‚Äì may be used only for a specified purpose. *Freeholding lease ‚Äì after approval is granted to convert a lease to freehold, and the lessee pays the purchase price in instalments. This is an interim tenure; freehold title is not issued until the all purchase costs have been paid. Residential tenancies Residential tenancies differ from state to state, governed by local legislation. =United Kingdom= Modern leasehold estates can take one of four forms‚Äîthe fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years, the periodic tenancy, the tenancy at will, and the tenancy at sufferance. Forms no longer used include socage and burgage. When a landowner allows one or more persons, called \\"tenants\\", to use the land in some way for some fixed period of time, the land becomes a leasehold, and the resident- (or worker-) landowner relation is called a \\"tenancy\\". A tenant pays rent (a form of consideration) to the landowner. The leasehold can include buildings and other improvements to the land. The tenant can do one or more of: farm the leasehold, live on it, or practise a trade on it. Typically, leasehold estates are held by tenants for a specific period of time. In England in recent years, some new homes and apartments have been sold by large housebuilders with a leasehold where the ground rent payable doubles every 10 to 25 years, with consequently a very high price to buy out the lease. This has caused some recently built homes to be extremely difficult to sell. In 2017, the British government launched a consultation on legal reforms to end such exploitative schemes. =United States= In the US, there are food co- ops that supply tenants with a place to grow their own produce. Rural tenancy is also a common practice. Under a rural tenancy, a person buys a large amount of land and the rural community uses it agriculturally as a source of income. The term estate for years appears to be a US term. This refers to a leasehold estate for any specific period of time (the word \\"years\\" is misleading, as the duration of the lease could be a day, a week, a month, etc.). An estate for years is not automatically renewed. Terminology = Fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years = A \\"fixed-term tenancy\\" or tenancy for years lasts for some fixed period of time. Despite the name, such a tenancy can last for any period of timeeven a tenancy for one week would be called a tenancy for years. At common law the duration did not need to be certain, but could be conditioned upon the happening of some event (e.g. \\"until the crops are ready for harvest\\", \\"until the war is over\\"). In many jurisdictions that possibility has been partially or totally abolished.For example in England and Wales the Law of Property Act 1925 s149(6) abolished leases for lives, and a lease expressed to be for a life is converted into a lease for 90 years, terminable on the death of the tenant. = Termination or expiration= The tenancy will come to an end automatically when the fixed term runs out, or, in the case of a tenancy that ends on the happening of an event, when the event occurs. It is also possible for a tenant, either expressly or impliedly, to give up the tenancy to the landlord. This process is known as a surrender of the lease. A tenancy may also come to an end when and if the tenant accepts a buyout agreement from their landlord. The landlord is able to offer to buy the property back from their tenant for a negotiated price as long as the deal is agreed upon by both parties.https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/01/29/the-new-rules-of- seeking-a-buyout-of-a-rent-regulated-tenant/ Depending on the laws in force in a particular jurisdiction, different circumstances may legally arise where a tenant remains in possession of property after the expiration of a lease. = Periodic tenancy = A periodic tenancy, also known as a tenancy from year to year, month to month, or week to week, is an estate that exists for some period of time determined by the term of the payment of rent. An oral lease for a tenancy of years that violates the statute of frauds (by committing to a lease of more than‚Äîdepending on the jurisdiction‚Äîone year without being in writing) may actually create a periodic tenancy, the construed term being dependent on the laws of the jurisdiction where the leased premises are located. In many jurisdictions the \\"default\\" tenancy, where the parties have not explicitly specified a different arrangement, and where none is presumed under local or business custom, is the month-to-month tenancy. = Tenancy at will = A tenancy at will or estate at will is a leasehold such that either the landlord or the tenant may terminate the tenancy at any time by giving reasonable notice. It usually occurs in the absence of a lease, or where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, tenancy at will can arise under the following circumstances: * the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is at will and not for rent. * a family member is allowed to live at home without formal arrangement. A nominal consideration may be required. * a tenant wishes to occupy the property urgently, but there was insufficient time to negotiate and execute a lease. The tenancy at will terminates in this case as soon as a written lease is completed. If a lease fails to be realized, the tenant must vacate the property. In a residential lease for consideration, a tenant may not be removed except for cause, even in the absence of a written lease. If a landlord can terminate the tenancy at will, a tenant by operation of law is also granted a reciprocal right to terminate at will. However, a lease that expressly continues at the will of the tenant (\\"for as long as the tenant desires to live on this land\\") does not automatically provide the landlord with a reciprocal right to terminate, even for cause. Rather, such language may be construed to convey to the tenant a life estate or even a fee simple. A tenancy at will terminates by operation of law, if: * the tenant commits waste against the property; * the tenant attempts to assign his tenancy; * the landlord transfers his interest in the property; * the landlord leases the property to another person; * the tenant or the landlord dies. = Tenancy at sufferance = A tenancy at sufferance (sometimes called a holdover tenancy) is created when a tenant wrongfully holds over past the end of the duration period of the tenancy (for example, a tenant who stays past the expiration of his or her lease). In this case, the landlord can hold over the tenant to a new tenancy, and collect rent for the period the tenant has held over. A tenancy at sufferance may exist when a tenant remains in possession of property even after the end of the lease, until the landlord acts to eject the tenant. The occupant may legally be a trespasser at this point, and the possession of this type may not be a true estate in land, even if authorities recognize the condition to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may be able to evict such a tenant at any time without notice. Action to evict will terminate a tenancy at sufferance, because the tenant no longer enjoys possession. Some jurisdictions impose an irrevocable election whereby the landlord treats the holdover as either a trespasser, or as a tenant at sufferance. A trespasser is not in possession; but a tenant at sufferance continues to enjoy possession of the real property. The landlord may also be able to impose a new lease on the holdover tenant. For a residential tenancy, such new tenancy lasts month to month. For a commercial tenancy of more than a year, the new tenancy is year to year; otherwise, the tenancy lasts for the same length of time as the duration under the original lease. In either case, the landlord can charge a higher rent, if the landlord, before the expiration of the original lease, has notified the tenant of the increase. Simply leaving property behind on the premises does not constitute possession and thus, a tenancy at sufferance cannot be established. E.g., Nathan Lane Assocs. v. Merchants Wholesale, 698 N.W.2d 136 (Iowa 2005); Brown v. Music, Inc., 359 P.2d 295 (Alaska 1961). = Continuation tenancy = In some jurisdictions, the tenant has a legal right to remain in occupation of the premises after the end of a lease unless the landlord complies with a formal process to dispossess the tenant of the property. For example, in England and Wales, a business tenant has a right to continue occupying their demise after the end of their lease under the provisions of sections 24‚Äì28 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (unless these provisions were formally excluded by agreement before the lease was completed). At the end of their lease they need do nothing but continue payment of rent at the previous level and uphold all other relevant covenants such as to keep the building in good repair. They cannot be evicted unless the landlord serves a formal notice to end the tenancy and successfully opposes the grant of the new lease to which the tenant has an automatic right. Even this can only be done under prescribed circumstances, for example the landlord's desire to occupy the premises himself or to demolish and redevelop the building.  Duties of participants  = Duties of landlord = The first duty of the landlord is to put the tenant in physical possession of the land at the outset of the lease (the English and majority rule, as opposed to the American rule which only requires the tenant be given legal possession, or the right to possess); the second is to provide the premises in a habitable condition‚Äîthere is an implied warranty of habitability. If landlord violates either, the tenant can terminate the lease and move out, or stay on the premises, while continuing to pay rent, and sue the landlord for damages (or withhold rent and use breach of implied warranty of habitability as a defense when the landlord attempts to collect rent). The lease also includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoymentlandlord will not interfere with tenant's quiet enjoyment. This can be breached in three ways. # Total eviction of the tenant through direct physical invasion by landlord. # Partial evictionwhen the landlord keeps the tenant off part of the leased property (even locking a single room). Tenant can stay on the remaining property without paying any rent. # Partial eviction by someone other than landlordwhere this occurs, rent is apportioned. If landlord claims to lease tenant an area of 1,000 square metres but 400 square metres of the area belongs to another person, tenant only has to pay 60% of the rent. = Landlord's tort liability = Under the common law, the landlord had no duties to the tenant to protect the tenant or the tenant's licensees and invitees, except in the following situations: # Failure to disclose latent defects of which the landlord knows or has reason to know. Note that the landlord has no duty to repair, just to disclose. # For a short term lease (3 months or less) of a furnished dwelling, the tenants are treated as invitees, and the landlord is liable for defects even if the landlord neither knows nor should know of them. # Common areas under landlord's control (e.g. hallways in an apartment building), if the landlord failed to use reasonable care in maintaining them. # Injury resulting from landlord's negligent repairseven if the landlord used all due care. # Public use, if the following three factors exist: ## Landlord knows or should know that the tenant makes public use of the land (e.g. the land is rented for use as a restaurant or a store); ## Landlord knows or should know that there is a defect; and ## Landlord knows or should know that the tenant will not fix the defect. = Duties of tenant = Under the common law, the tenant has two duties to the landlord: # to pay rent when it is due, # to avoid waste of the property. A tenant is liable to third party invitees for negligent failure to correct a dangerous condition on the premiseeven if the landlord was contractually liable.  Effects of condemnation  If land under lease to a tenant is condemned under the government's power of eminent domain, the tenant may be able to earn either a reduction in rent or a portion of the condemnation award (the price paid by the government) to the owner, depending on the amount of land taken, and the value of the leasehold property. With a partial taking of the land, the tenant may claim apportioned rent for property taken. For example, suppose a tenant leases land for six months for ¬§1,000 per month, and that two months into the lease, and the government condemns 25% of the land. The tenant will then be entitled to take a portion of the condemnation award equal to 25% of the rent due for the remaining four months of the lease‚Äî¬§1,000, derived from ¬§250 per month for four months. A full taking, however, extinguishes the lease, and excuses all rent from that point. The tenant will not be entitled to any portion of the condemnation award, unless the value of the lease was greater than the rent paid, in which case the tenant can recover the difference. Suppose in the above example that the market value of the land being leased was actually ¬§1,200 a month, but the ¬§1,000 per month rate represented a break given to the tenant by the landlord. Because the tenant is losing the ability to continue renting the land at this bargain rate (and probably must move to more expensive land), the tenant will be entitled to the difference between the lease rate and the market value ‚Äì ¬§200 per month for a total of ¬§800.

At an elevation of , it is the highest mountain in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the highest point in the state of Tennessee, and the highest point along the Appalachian Trail. It is also the third highest point in mainland Eastern North America, after the nearby Mount Mitchell () and Mount Craig (). Description Clingmans Dome has two subpeaks: Mount Buckley to the west and Mount Love to the east. The headwaters of several substantial streams are located on the slopes of Clingmans Dome, namely Little River on the north slope, and Forney Creek and Noland Creek (both tributaries of the Tuckasegee River) on the south slope. The mountain is located entirely within the Tennessee River watershed.National Park Service (2013) Clingmans Dome, Great Smoky Mountains National Park NC, TN, National Park Service, U.S. Department of Interior. Retrieved 2013-7-28. Clingmans Dome is protected as part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A paved road connects it to U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road). The concrete observation tower, built in 1959 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, offers a panoramic view of the mountains. An air quality monitoring station, operated by the Environmental Protection Agency, is the second highest in eastern North America. The Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest which covers Clingmans Dome occurs only at the highest elevations in the southeastern United States, and has more in common with forests at northern latitudes than with the forests in the adjacent valleys. Clingmans Dome stands prominently above the surrounding terrain, rising nearly from base to summit. The forest on and around Clingmans Dome has experienced a large die-off of Fraser fir caused by the non-native insect, balsam woolly adelgid. History The Cherokee name for Clingmans Dome was Kuwa'hi, or \\"mulberry place.\\" According to a Cherokee myth recorded by ethnologist James Mooney in the late 19th century, the mountain was the home of the White Bear, the great chief of all bears, and the location of one of the bears' councilhouses. The enchanted lake of Ataga'hi (\\"Gall Place\\"), the waters of which could cure wounded bears, was believed by the Cherokee to be located somewhere between Clingmans Dome and the headwaters of the Oconaluftee River to the east.James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: C and R Elder, 1972), pp. 264, 321. In 1789, an act passed by the North Carolina legislature ceded what is now Tennessee to the federal government. This act fixed a portion of the boundary between the two along the crest of the \\"Great Iron or Smoky Mountains,\\" which would have included the mountain now known as Clingmans Dome. The mountain was dubbed \\"Smoky Dome\\" by American settlers moving in from other areas. In 1859, the mountain was renamed by Arnold Guyot for compatriot Thomas Lanier Clingman (1812‚Äì1897), an American Civil War confederate general who explored the area extensively in the 1850s and then spent many years promoting it. Guyot named the mountain for Clingman because of an argument between Clingman and a professor at the University of North Carolina, Elisha Mitchell, over which mountain was actually the highest in the region. Mitchell contended that a peak by the name of Black Dome (now known as Mount Mitchell) was the highest, while Clingman asserted that Smoky Dome was the true highest peak. Guyot determined that Black Dome was higher than Smoky Dome. In the early morning hours of June 12, 1946, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress crashed near the summit of Clingmans Dome, killing all twelve aboard. Geology Clingmans Dome is part of a geological formation known as the Copperhill Formation. It consists predominately of massive, coarse-grained metagreywacke and metaconglomerate. The Lower northern flanks of Clingmans Dome are underlain by thick layers of sulfidic, quartz-garnet-muscovite phyllite and schist, which occur within the metagraywackes and metaconglomerates. Adjacent to and south of its summit, thin, southward-dipping, and discontinuous beds of garnetiferous, locally graphitic and sulfidic, metasiltstone occur within the Copperhill Formation.Southworth, S, A Schultz, JN Aleinikoff, and AJ Merschat (2012) Geologic map of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park region, Tennessee and North Carolina. Scientific Investigations Map no. 2997. United States Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia, one sheet, scale 1:100,000, and 54-p. pamphlet. The Copperhill Formation is part of the greater Ocoee Supergroup, a body of clastic metasedimentary rocks formed 560 million years ago. They unconformably lie upon Precambrian granitic and gneissic rocks. The sediments that originally comprised the Ocoee Supergroup accumulated in a string of narrow, deep-water basins that stretched along the entire southern- central Appalachian margin from Tennessee, North Carolina, to Georgia. These basins were rift basins formed by the rifting of Rodinia.Hatcher, RD, Jr. (2005) Southern and Central Appalachians, Regional Geology of North America. in RC Selley, LRM Cocks and IR Plimer, eds., pp. 72-81, Encyclopedia of Geology. Elsevier Publishers, London, Hatcher, RD, Jr., WA Thomas, and GW, Viele, (1989) The Appalachian‚ÄìOuachita orogen in the United States. The Geology of North America, vol. F‚Äì2. Geological Society of America, Boulder, Colorado. The initial metamorphism of the Ocoee Supergroup occurred about 400 million years ago as the result of Ordovician-Silurian tectonism during the Taconic orogeny. Later, Devonian-Mississippian metamorphism of these strata occurred during the Acadian orogeny and additional Pennsylvanian to Permian alteration by retrograde metamorphism and deformation occurred during the Alleghanian orogeny. During the latest part of this orogeny, this segment of the Appalachian Mountains was formed by thrust faulting and folding that uplifted these strata as a series of complexly deformed thrust sheets. During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, the gradual uplift and erosion of this part of the Appalachian Mountains has continued. Although a dense forest understory covers most of the mountain, outcroppings of the Copperhill Formation can be found on Clingmans Dome at the Forney Ridge Parking Lot at the end of Clingmans Dome Road. This outcrop exposes massive metaconglomerate of the Copperhill Formation. At this outcrop, it consists of massive thick beds of micaceous quartzite. It contains coarse pebbles of quartz and feldspar, flat pebbles of fine-grained black graywacke, and egg-shaped concretions up to in diameter. These cobble-size concretions are readily eroded by weathering to leave rust- stained depressions or cavities in the metaconglomerate.Stose, GW, and AJ Stose (1949) Ocoee Series of the Southern Appalachians. Geological Society of America Bulletin. 60(2):267-320. Soils of Clingmans Dome are mostly moderately deep to shallow, well drained dark brown loam or sandy loam of strong to extreme acidity; Breakneck and Pullback series are most common.SoilWeb, University of California-Davis California Soil Resource Lab, Natural Resources Conservation Service. Accessed: 12 January 2016. Access Information Center, July 2012 Clingmans Dome is the most accessible mountain top in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Clingmans Dome Road, which is open annually from April 1 through November 30, begins just past Newfound Gap and leads up the mountain to the Forney Ridge Parking Area, below the summit. A half-mile (800 m) paved trail leads from the parking lot to the observation tower at the top of the mountain. The short, steep trail provides a small visitor information center and park store staffed by the Great Smoky Mountains Association, garbage cans, and numerous benches to the side of the path. Vault toilet restrooms are available. The trail offers a glimpse of the often hostile environment of highland Appalachia, passing through the spruce-fir forest and its accompanying blowdowns and dead Fraser Firs. The Appalachian Trail crosses Clingmans Dome, passing immediately north of the observation tower. A leg of the trail connects the mountain with Newfound Gap, and provides the only access to the mountain in winter months. The nearest A.T. backcountry shelters are the Double Spring Gap Shelter, which is to the west near the Goshen Prong junction, and the Mount Collins shelter, which is to the east near the A.T.'s Sugarland Mountain Trail junction. Clingmans Dome is the upper terminus for several additional hiking trails, including the Forney Ridge Trail (to Andrews Bald) and the Forney Creek Trail (to the Benton MacKaye Trail on the shores of Fontana Lake). The western terminus of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail, which connects the Smokies to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, is located atop Clingmans Dome. It follows the Appalachian Trail for to the east, where it then begins to descend toward the Blue Ridge Parkway, via the Fork Ridge Trail. Clingmans Dome Observation Tower Built in 1959, the concrete observation tower features a circular observation platform accessed by a spiral ramp. The ramp is in length, and rises at a 12 percent grade, in synch with the Clingmans Dome Trail. The platform, in diameter, allows spectators a 360-degree panorama of the surrounding terrain. Cantilevered signs point out the various peaks, ridges, cities, and other features visible in the distance. Depending on the haze, visibility ranges from on hazy days to on very clear days. The tower was one of nine observation towers constructed as part of the Mission 66 program (1955-1966), an effort by the National Park Service to upgrade its facilities to accommodate an influx of visitors to national parks during the post-World War II era. Designed by Hubert Bebb of the Gatlinburg-based architecture firm Bebb and Olson, the tower's modern design, especially the use of concrete as the primary building material, marked a departure from previous park structures, which favored more rustic elements. Though some criticized the Clingmans Dome tower as too \\"urban,\\" two other park service observation towers-- the nearby Look Rock tower along Foothills Parkway and the Shark Valley tower at Everglades National Park-- were built using similar designs. Bebb's original design consisted of a massive stone tower topped by a circular platform and fire observation cab, and accessed by a concrete ramp. Fred Arnold, head of the park service's Forest and Wildlife Protection branch, rejected the inclusion of the fire observation cab, arguing that while Clingmans Dome was the highest point in the park, it wasn't particularly useful for fire detection purposes. Park service director Conrad Wirth objected to the use of a ramp, favoring instead a spiral staircase. After John B. Cabot, head of the park service's Eastern Office of Design and Construction, convinced him of the ramp's usefulness, Wirth decided the stone tower would not be necessary, stating a single central support column would suffice. The tower was built by the Waynesville-based construction firm of W.C. Norris at a cost of $57,000 (). Ground was broken in December 1958. After several weather delays, the tower was completed on October 23, 1959.

Muromachi period, 15th century, Tokyo National Museum, Important Cultural Property Azuchi-Momoyama - Edo period, Tokyo National Museum Kabuto (ÂÖú, ÂÜë) is a type of helmet first used by ancient Japanese warriors, and in later periods, they became an important part of the traditional Japanese armour worn by the samurai class and their retainers in feudal Japan. Note that in the Japanese language, the word kabuto is an appellative, not a type description, and can refer to any combat helmet. History Japanese helmets dating from the fifth century (long before the rise of the samurai class) have been found in excavated tombs. Called mabizashi-tsuke kabuto (visor-attached helmet), the style of these kabuto came from China and Korea and they had a pronounced central ridge. Kabuto, which is now known as a samurai helmet, first appeared in the 10th century Heian period with the appearance of ≈ç-yoroi. In the Sengoku period in the 16th century, when battles between samurai changed into gun and group battles, ≈ç-yoroi and d≈ç-maru went out of fashion and tosei-gusoku (gusoku) was born, and the style of kabuto changed greatly.ÂºèÊ≠£„ÅÆÈéß„ÉªÂ§ßÈéß Costume Museum In the Edo period, when the Tokugawa shogunate defeated the Toyotomi clan at Summer Siege of Osaka and the society became peaceful, armor with a revival of the medieval times became popular, and ≈ç-yoroi and d≈ç-maru style kabuto were made again.Áî≤ÂÜë„Å´Ë¶ã„ÇãÊ±üÊà∏ÊôÇ‰ª£Â±ï5 Ê≠¶Â£´„Å®Ê≠¶‰∫∫„ÅÆÁî≤ÂÜëÂÉè Fukuoka City Museum The kabuto was an important part of the equipment of the samurai, and played a symbolic role as well, which may explain the Japanese expressions, sayings and codes related to them.

Parts of the kabuto 1\\\\. hachi 2\\\\. shikoro 3\\\\. fukigaeshi 4\\\\. mae-zashi 5\\\\. hari-date 6\\\\. datemono 7\\\\. hachimanza The basic parts of the kabuto include: *Hachi, a dome composed of overlapping elongated plates called tate hagi-no-ita *Tehen, a small opening at the top of the hachi, usually fitted with a tehen kanamono (an ornamental grommet, often resembling a chrysanthemum) *Mabizashi, a brim or visor on the front of the hachi *Ukebari, a cloth lining inside the hachi *Tsunamoto, mounting points for attaching crests *Kasa jirushi no kan, a ring at the back of the hachi for securing a kasa jirushi (helmet flag) *Fukigaeshi, wing-like or ear-like projections to the sides of the hachi *Shikoro, a suspended neck guard composed of multiple overlapping lames *Shinobi-no-o (chin cord), often used to secure the mengu (facial armour) A typical kabuto features a central dome constructed of anywhere from three to over a hundred metal plates riveted together. These were usually arranged vertically, radiating from a small opening in the top. The rivets securing these metal plates to each other could be raised (a form known as hoshi-bachi) or hammered flat (a form known as suji-bachi); another form, called hari bachi, had the rivets filed flush. Some of the finer hachi were signed by their makers, usually from one of several known families, such as the Myochin, Saotome, Haruta, Unkai, or Nagasone families. A suji bachi kabuto with the cords tied under the chin; note the prominent front crest, the recurving fukigaeshi, and the shikoro composed of hundreds of interlaced scales A small opening in the top of the kabuto, called the tehen or hachimanza (seat of the war god, Hachiman), was thought to be for passing the warrior's top knot through. Although this practice was largely abandoned after the Muromachi period, this opening may have been retained for purposes of ventilation or simply as an artifact of how the plates were riveted together. The tehen was usually decorated with tehen kanamono, which were rings of intricately worked, soft metal bands often resembling a chrysanthemum. Zunari kabuto and momonari kabuto were two helmet forms that did not usually have an opening at the top. Kabuto incorporated a suspended neck guard called a shikoro, usually composed of three to seven semicircular, lacquered metal or oxhide lames, attached and articulated by silk or leather lacing, although some shikoro were composed of 100 or more small metal scales in a row.The Encyclopedia Americana: a library of universal knowledge, Volume 15 p.774 This lamellar armour style, along with kusari (mail armour), was the standard technology of Japanese body armour, and some shikoro were made of mail sewn to a cloth lining (a form called kusari shikoro). The kabuto was secured to the head by a chin cord called shinobi- no-o, which would usually be tied to posts or hooks on the mengu (facial armour) or simply tied under the chin. Kabuto are often adorned with crests called datemono or tatemono; the four types of decorations were the maedate (frontal decoration), wakidate (side decorations), kashiradate (top decoration), and ushirodate (rear decoration). These can be family crests (mon), or flat or sculptural objects representing animals, mythical entities, prayers or other symbols. Horns are particularly common, and many kabuto incorporate kuwagata, stylized antlers. File:Formen des Hoshi Kabuto.jpgVarious hachi shapes:1. Nari Akoda2. Goshozan 3. Heichozan 4. Koseizan 5.

Hoshi-bachi kabuto could also be suji bachi kabuto if there were raised ribs or ridges showing where the helmet plates came together. =Hari bachi kabuto= Hari bachi kabuto is multiple- plate Japanese hachi with no ribs or ridges showing where the helmet plates come and the rivets are filed flush. =Zunari kabuto= Edo period iron zunari kabuto The zunari kabuto is a simple, five-plate design. =Tatami kabuto= A great number of simpler, lightweight, folding, portable armours for lower-ranking samurai and foot soldiers (ashigaru) were also produced. These were called tatami armour, and some featured collapsible tatami kabuto (also called choshin-kabuto), made from articulated lames.Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan - Page 279 Asiatic Society of Japan - 1881.Arms and Armor of the Samurai Ian Bottomley, Anthony Hopson Random House Value Publishing, 1993 p.92 Tatami kabuto did not use rivets in their construction; instead, lacing or chain mail was used to connect the pieces to each other. =Kaji kabuto= Kaji kabuto were a type of helmet worn by samurai firemen. =Jingasa= Jingasa were war hats made in a variety of shapes, worn by ashigaru (foot soldiers) and samurai, which could be made from leather or metal. =Kawari kabuto or strange helmet= During the Momoyama period of intense civil warfare, kabuto were made to a simpler design of three or four plates, lacking many of the ornamental features of earlier helmets. To offset the plain, utilitarian form of the new helmet, and to provide visibility and presence on the battlefield, armorers began to build fantastic shapes on top of the simple helmets in harikake (papier-m√¢ch√© mixed with lacquer over a wooden armature), though some were constructed entirely of iron. These shapes mimicked forms from Japanese culture and mythology, including fish, cow horns, the head of the god of longevity, bolts of silk, head scarves, Ichi-no-Tani canyon, and axe heads, among many others. Some forms were realistically rendered, while others took on a very futuristic, modernist feel.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2011. Web. 04 Mar. 2011. He skillfully expounded the ideals of popular democracy and classless society to crowds of Parisian sans-culottes, working class wage earners and shopkeepers, radicalizing them into a dangerous revolutionary force. He became a leader of a popular far-left. Radical revolutionary In 1791 Roux was elected to the Paris Commune. When the French First Republic started in 1792, Roux became aligned with the political faction dubbed by their enemies as the Enrag√©s () (French for The Enraged Ones but also a \\"madman\\"). He was considered the most extreme spokesman on the left for the interests of the Parisian sans-culottes. Roux consistently fought for an economically equal society, turning the crowds of sans-culottes against the bourgeois torpor of the Jacobins. He demanded that food be made available to every member of society, and called for the wealthy to be executed should they hoard it. Roux tirelessly voiced the demands of the poor Parisian population to confiscate aristocratic wealth and provide affordable bread. He became popular enough that, as the split between the Girondins and the Montagnards grew wider, his voice helped remove the Girondins from the National Convention in 1793.Slavin, Morris. \\"Jacques Roux: A Victim of Vilification.\\" French Historical Studies, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Autumn, 1964), pp. 525‚Äì537.  Manifesto of the Enrag√©s  In a controversial 1793 address to the National Convention that's been dubbed the Manifesto of the Enrag√©s, Roux demanded the abolition of private property and class society in the name of the people he represented.[6] In many ways Roux and the Enrag√©s were prescient in anticipating many of the themes Karl Marx would develop in his analytical theory decades later. Soon, Roux's incendiary rhetoric was igniting food riots and upsetting the balance of power within the Paris Commune. Maximilien Robespierre, fearing Roux threatened the dominance of the Jacobin government, presented accusations of him being a foreign spy intentionally trying to disrupt the revolutionary government and the Committee of Public Safety.[1] During this time, Roux's former friend, Jean-Paul Marat, also turned against him, writing in his newspaper, L'Ami du peuple, that Roux was a false priest that was only interested in religion as long as it provided income.[7] On July 7, 1793, Roux's enemies brought Elizabeth Marguerite H√©bert in for questioning in an attempt to charge Roux with extortion and \\"misappropriation of charitable funds.\\" H√©bert was a recent widow with no means to support herself and, two years earlier, Roux had agreed to raise funds for her and her family. When asked if Roux had an ulterior motive, she replied that she did not believe he did.[5] He wasn't arrested then, but in August 1793, Roux was arrested under the charges that he had withheld funds from both the widow H√©bert and another widow, Mlle Beaurepaire. Roux assured the revolutionary committee of section Gravilliers that he did nothing of the sort and that his enemies were working against him.[5] Roux was released into the custody of two of his friends, where he continued fighting for his ideals. On September 5, 1793, Roux was thrown into prison again.  Death  On January 14, 1794, Roux was informed that his case was going to be tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal. Upon hearing this news, Roux pulled out a knife and stabbed himself several times, but failed to land a fatal blow. Less than a month later, on February 10, 1794 while recovering in prison, Roux stabbed himself again, this time succeeding in killing himself. He was 41.[5] As the Enrag√©s movement began falling apart, Jacques H√©bert's more moderate left-wing faction known as the H√©bertists tried to win over his former supporters and continue where he had left off.[1] In popular culture Roux (played by Elias Toufexis) is featured in a mission in French Revolution-set Assassin's Creed Unity, in which the player is tasked with assassinating him. In Peter Weiss's Marat/Sade, Roux is portrayed by an asylum patient in the Marquis de Sade's dramatization of Jean-Paul Marat's assassination. The actor's lines come under fire by the asylum directors, who have cut his dialogue. In most productions, the actor portraying Roux is costumed in a straight jacket, which symbolizes the asylum's desire to restrain political radicals such as himself.

Their music is a blend of funky rhythms, heavy rock guitars and expressive soul/R&B-style; vocals. The group charted with the singles \\"Fire\\" (No. 93 Pop Singles), \\"Baby Love\\" (No. 79 Black Singles, No. 58 Pop Singles), \\"Don't Wanna Come Back\\" (No. 54 Black Singles), \\"Love Changes\\" (No. 26 Black Singles), and \\"Piece of the Rock\\" in the mid- to late 1970s. History Mother's Finest issued its debut album Mother's Finest in 1972 on RCA; a second album for RCA remained unreleased until it surfaced as bonus tracks on the 2010 Wounded Bird re-issue of Mother's Finest. The group signed a new contract with Epic Records and released its sophomore effort, also titled Mother's Finest, in 1976, stirring up controversy with the ironic \\"Niggizz Can't Sang Rock 'n' Roll.\\" Riding a wave of success, the band's next three albums, Another Mother Further (1977), Mother Factor (1978) and Mother‚Äôs Finest Live (1979), all went gold, helped along by heavy touring opening for the likes of Ted Nugent, Black Sabbath, The Who, Aerosmith and AC/DC. In 1978, the band set out for Europe and took part in the Rockpalast concert series at the Grugahalle in Essen, produced by Germany's WDR television and broadcast to various countries. With only one concert Mother's Finest put themselves on the map all over Europe where the band still has a dedicated following. The legendary 1978 show was finally released on CD and DVD in 2012 as Mother's Finest - Live At Rockpalast 1978 & 2003 which also includes the band's 2003 \\"Rockpalast\\" appearance at Satzvey Castle. After four albums for Epic/CBS in the 70's, the band signed with Atlantic Records for its heaviest album to date, 1981's Iron Age. That same year Joyce Kennedy guested with Molly Hatchet on the song \\"Respect Me in the Morning\\" from the Take No Prisoners album. Mother's Finest went on hiatus after 1983's One Mother to Another, with vocalist Joyce Kennedy pursuing a solo career, releasing the soul/R&B-styled; Lookin' for Trouble album on A&M; Records in 1984. She scored a Billboard Top 40 hit with \\"The First Time I Made Love,\\" a duet with Jeffrey Osborne. A year later, Joyce recorded the song \\"Didn't I Tell You?\\" for the soundtrack of the film The Breakfast Club. Drummer Barry Borden, who had joined Molly Hatchet on the No Guts...No Glory album, teamed up with guitarist Moses Mo in the band Illusion, resulting in a pair of albums, Illusion (1985) and I Like It Loud (1986), on Geffen Records. Borden would later join The Outlaws for a pair of albums and has been a member of The Marshall Tucker Band since the late 1990s. Meanwhile, bassist Wyzard toured with Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks behind her 1983 album The Wild Heart, including an appearance on Saturday Night Live. Eventually, he and brother/drummer Harold Seay, who had replaced Barry Borden on One Mother to Another, joined Rick Medlocke in a revamped Blackfoot line-up and appeared on 1987's Rick Medlocke and Blackfoot album. Mother's Finest re- formed for 1989's Looks Could Kill on Capitol/EMI Records, with only drummer Barry Borden missing from the classic line-up. He was replaced by Joyce Kennedy and Glenn Murdock's son, Dion Derek Murdock. In 1990, the band released its second live album, Subluxation, on RCA/BMG, albeit only in Europe. It was the first album to feature guitarist John \\"Red Devil\\" Hayes, formerly of Atlanta's PG-13, hired in place of the departing Moses Mo. The band moved over to Scotti Bros. for 1992's Black Radio Won't Play This Record, a heavy Thom Panunzio produced funk metal affair, recorded with the help of former Sound Barrier member Tracey \\"Spacey T\\" Singleton on guitar. The band continued to tour heavily, especially in Europe, but did not release another studio CD until 2004's Meta-Funk'n-Physical, an experimental, hip hop- and electronic beats-oriented effort. In 1997, drummer Dion Murdock lent his services to Kingdome Come and appeared on their Master Seven album. In 1999, Wyzard, Moses Mo and longtime Mother's Finest touring keyboardist Pascal Kravetz joined multi-national band Carl Carlton & The Songdogs, releasing a handful of albums along the way. In 2002, Moses Mo issued his solo album, Cartoon You, which features contributions from Glenn Murdock, Joyce Kennedy and Wyzard, along with several other members of the extended Mother's Finest family, Kerry Denton, Harold Seay, Johnnetta Johnson and Pascal Kravetz. In 2008, Wyzard released his solo album, Primal Incantation, featuring brother Harold Seay on drums. Beginning in 2004, Joyce Kennedy was seen on the international Daughters of Soul tour along with Sandra St. Victor, Nona Hendryx, Lalah Hathaway (daughter of Donny Hathaway), Indira Khan (daughter of Chaka Khan), and Simone (daughter of Nina Simone). Nona Hendryx would cover Mother's Finest's \\"Truth'll Set You Free\\" off Another Mother Further with her group Labelle on their 2008 album Back to Now. In 2010, fellow Georgia rockers Jackyl, featuring Darryl McDaniels from Run-D.M.C., paid homage to Mother's Finest with a cover of \\"Like a Negro\\" from Black Radio Won't Play This Record and also shot a video.. Jackyl frontman Jesse James Dupree had previously been in PG-13 with John Hayes in the late 1980s; Dupree, Hayes, Dion Derek Murdock and Wyzard also played together under the name Dent. The band recorded an album for Sony Music, which was ultimately shelved by the label and remains unreleased. On September 16, 2011, Mother's Finest was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. In July 2013, Mother's Finest launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a new studio album. In November 2014, it was announced that the band had signed a European record deal with SPV/Steamhammer for their new studio, Goody 2 Shoes & The Filthy Beast, set for a spring 2015 release. An advance single, \\"Shut Up\\", was issued on St. Nicholas Day, December 6, 2014 \\"as a present to all their European fans.\\" In November 2015, Australian label Raven Records re-issued the band's 4 albums for Epic Records, Mother's Finest ('76), Another Mother Further ('77), Mother Factor ('78) and Live ('79) as a 2-disc package. British label SoulMusic Records would issue the 2-disc Love Changes: The Anthology 1972 - 1983 set in March 2017, including 2 songs from the band's 1972 debut album for RCA and a further 6 cuts from the second unreleased RCA album. These eight songs had previously been available on CD as bonus tracks on the now out-of-print Wounded Bird Records re-issue of the 1976 Mother's Finest album.

It is located a few miles northwest of the town of Delta in Cheaha State Park, which offers a lodge, a restaurant, and other amenities. Description The highest point is marked with a USGS benchmark in front of Bunker Tower, a stone Civilian Conservation Corps building with an observation deck on top. The CCC also constructed a road to Cheaha, but the road has been closed for years. The old road is known as CC Road and contains interesting ruins. Near the peak is Bald Rock, which was recently improved with a wheelchair-accessible wooden walkway that provides an impressive overlook of the surrounding region. The entire area gives an impression of being at a much higher elevation than it actually is, in part because of the relatively low elevation of the adjacent area to the west. Cheaha Mountain is part of the Talladega Mountains, a final southern segment of the Blue Ridge Mountains, unlike other elevations of the Appalachians in north Alabama, which are part of the Cumberland Plateau. The mountain is the highest point in the eastern portion of the Sun Belt (east of the Mississippi River, south of Interstate 20, and north of the Gulf of Mexico). Geologically it is composed of weakly metamorphosed sandstones and conglomerates of the Cheaha quartzite, of Silurian / Devonian age, and stands high topographically due to the erosional resistance of these rocks. The soil, only moderately deep, is a brown stony silt loam of the Cheaha series; it is well drained and very strongly acidic.https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/ SoilWeb--select Cheaha Mountain The mountain was opened to the public as part of Cheaha State Park on June 7, 1939. The mountain is a host to several commercial and public service transmitters. These radio antennas, along with sundry structures dating back to commercial schemes by the state of Alabama in the 1970s, stand in stark contrast to the surrounding natural environment. The Calhoun County Amateur Radio Association has a repeater near the peak, and Alabama Public Television has its transmitter for WCIQ TV 7 on a tower tall, rebuilt after the January 1982 ice storm brought the previous one crashing to the ground.

Since the late 1980s, he has appeared on American television and has written for The New York Times, Food & Wine and other publications. He has authored over 30 cookbooks, some of which have become best sellers. P√©pin was a longtime friend of the American chef Julia Child, and their 1999 PBS series Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home won a Daytime Emmy Award. He has been honored with 24 James Beard Foundation Awards, five honorary doctoral degrees, the American Public Television‚Äôs lifetime achievement award, the Emmy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2019 and the L√©gion d'honneur, France's highest order of merit in 2004. Since 1989, P√©pin has taught in the Culinary Arts Program at Boston University and, served as dean of special programs at the International Culinary Center in New York City. In 2016, with his daughter, Claudine P√©pin and his son-in-law, Rollie Wesen, P√©pin created the Jacques P√©pin Foundation to support culinary education for adults with barriers to employment. He and his wife Gloria have lived in Connecticut since 1975. Early years P√©pin, the second of three sons, was born in 1935 in Bourg-en-Bresse, near Lyon, France. After World War II, his parents, Jeannette and Jean-Victor P√©pin, owned the restaurant Le P√©lican, where P√©pin worked as a child, and later became known for his love for food. At the age of thirteen, he started his apprenticeship at Le Grand H√¥tel de l‚ÄôEurope in Bourg-en-Bresse. At 16, he went on to work in Paris, training under Lucien Diat at the Plaza Ath√©n√©e. From 1956 to 1958, during his military service, P√©pin was recognized for his culinary training and skill and was ordered to work in the Office of the Treasury, where he met his long-time cooking partner, Jean-Claude Szurdak, and eventually became the personal chef to three French heads of state, including Charles de Gaulle. In 1959, P√©pin went to the United States to work at the restaurant Le Pavillon. Wanting to complete his education, he enrolled in English for foreign students, a GED equivalent and eventually General Studies classes toward a Bachelor of Arts degree at Columbia University. Soon after his arrival, The New York Times food editor Craig Claiborne introduced P√©pin to James Beard and Helen McCully. McCully introduced P√©pin to Julia Child, who became a lifelong friend and collaborator. In 1961, after P√©pin had declined an offer from Joseph Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to serve as chef at the White House, Howard Johnson, a regular Le Pavillon customer, hired him to work alongside fellow Frenchman Pierre Franey to develop food lines for his chain of Howard Johnson's restaurants, where P√©pin served as the director of research and development for a decade. In 1970, P√©pin earned his Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University's School of General Studies, and in 1972, his Masters of Arts in French literature from the Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. P√©pin entered into a doctoral program at Columbia, but his proposed thesis on French food in literature was rejected for being \\"too frivolous for serious academic pursuit\\", (P√©pin, para. 3) In 1970, P√©pin opened a specialty soup restaurant and lunch counter on Manhattan's 5th Avenue called La Potagerie, and began to enjoy popular success with appearances on talk shows such as What's My Line? and To Tell the Truth. P√©pin's career as a restaurant chef ended abruptly with a near fatal car accident in 1974.  Middle career  Beginning in the mid-1970s, P√©pin reinvented himself as an educator, author and eventually a television personality. P√©pin worked as a consultant for restaurateur Joe Baum on his Windows on the World project, and offering classes at small cooking schools and cookware shops around the United States. In 1976, P√©pin authored his cookbook La Technique, followed by La Methode in 1979. The use of thousands of photographs, illustrating the techniques and methods required to achieve certain culinary results, provided a window into the art of cooking. The books are credited by chef Tom Colicchio and others as helping them to learn the craft of cooking. In 1982, along with Alain Saihlac and Andr√© Soltner, P√©pin was invited by Dorothy Cann Hamilton to become one of the deans at the newly formed culinary school, the French Culinary Institute, in New York City, now known as the International Culinary Center (ICC). Also 1982, he filmed his first television series, with PBS local station WJCT-TV in Jacksonville, Florida, and published a companion cookbook entitled Everyday Cooking with Jacques P√©pin. Through the 1980s and into the 1990s, P√©pin was published as a columnist for The New York Times, and a guest author for Gourmet, Food & Wine and many others. He authored several more cookbooks, including The Art of Cooking, volumes 1 and 2, and The Short-Cut Cook. In 1989, P√©pin partnered Julia Child and Rebecca Alssid to create a culinary certificate program within the Metropolitan College at Boston University (BU). This effort eventually led to the first, and still one of the few, Masters Degrees in Gastronomy. P√©pin‚Äôs 1991 television series Today‚Äôs Gourmet, filmed at KQED studios in San Francisco was created from recipes from several books, brought together in the companion cookbook Jacques P√©pin's Table. In 1994 and 1996, Pepin and Julia Child appeared in 90 minute PBS specials, Cooking In Concert and More Cooking In Concert, filmed live before a Boston audience as part of the PBS annual fund drives for those years. In 1996, P√©pin introduced his then 18-year-old daughter Claudine, in three television series and companion books: Cooking with Claudine, Encore with Claudine and Jacques P√©pin Celebrates. The father to daughter relationship, combined with an instructor to culinary novice relationship, demonstrated P√©pin's work as a chef and teacher. Each of the three series earned the pair James Beard Foundation Awards. In 1999, P√©pin teamed up with Julia Child for the series and companion book Jacques and Julia Cooking at Home. The TV series, produced by Susie Heller, won a Daytime Emmy Award and a James Beard Foundation Award. In 2003, P√©pin published his autobiography, The Apprentice: My Life in the Kitchen.  Later career  In the 21st century, P√©pin continues to cook, write, publish, film for television, paint and take on new projects. Throughout his career, he has toured and taught on cruise ships including the Queen Elizabeth 2, and the Crystal Cruises and Princess Cruises lines. In 2003, he was named the executive culinary director of Oceania Cruises, and \\"is credited with helping it achieve its reputation for culinary excellence and style\\", (Levine, para. 8). P√©pin continues to teach at the ICC and at BU, and offers book signings, culinary demonstrations and classes on Oceania cruises and at various locations across the USA, several times per year. Since his time as a student at Columbia University, P√©pin has dabbled in and enjoyed drawing and painting. In recent years, he has committed more time to his art, and enjoyed some success with commercial sales on his website, Jacques P√©pin Art, and juried shows. In the first decade of the 2000s, P√©pin published several more cookbooks including Fast Food My Way and More Fast Food My Way, which were paired with television series of the same name, produced by Tina Salter, and Chez Jacques: Traditions and Rituals of a Cook, that significantly featured P√©pin's art. In 2011, P√©pin filmed the series Essential P√©pin at KQED studios and published a companion cookbook with over 700 recipes and a set of technique-oriented videos. In 2012, he published New Complete Techniques, which combined and updated his important earlier works La Technique and La Methode. In 2015 Chef Jacques P√©pin, 79, recovered at his home in Connecticut after suffering a minor stroke. P√©pin canceled his appearance at the annual International Association of Culinary Professionals conference in Washington D.C., but otherwise insisted on returning to his normal schedule, according to The Associated Press. \\"Oh my god, he made soup this morning,\\" P√©pin‚Äôs daughter Claudine told the Associated Press. \\"I will do my best to lighten the load, but he's not of the mind to cancel anything. Honestly, he wanted to go to IACP. He's like, 'I'm talking. I can walk. Let's go. In 2016, with his daughter Claudine P√©pin and son-in-law Rollie Wesen, Jacques created his eponymous, non-profit, organization the Jacques P√©pin Foundation (JPF). The mission of the foundation is to support organizations that provide culinary training to adults and youths with barriers to employment such as low-income, low-skills, homelessness, issues with substance abuse and previous incarceration. The JPF provides grants, independent research, source and curricular materials, equipment, direct teaching and video instruction to community-based culinary training programs around the USA. In 2017, P√©pin published a cookbook with his granddaughter Shorey Wesen, entitled A Grandfather's Lessons. In the same year, P√©pin received an honorary doctorate from the Columbia University School of General Studies. P√©pin resides with his wife, Gloria, in Connecticut. Television The success of P√©pin's book La Technique, used as a textbook for teaching the fundamentals of French cuisine, prompted him to launch a televised version resulting in a 1997 PBS series, The Complete P√©pin. Relaunched on PBS ten years after its initial run, the series included a new introduction by P√©pin where he stressed that the secret to being a successful chef and not a mere line cook lies in knowing and using the proper technique. In 1999, P√©pin co-starred in the PBS series Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home alongside Julia Child. The program was awarded a Daytime Emmy in 2001. His show Jacques P√©pin: Fast Food My Way (based on his 2004 book of the same name) ran on PBS, and Jacques P√©pin: More Fast Food My Way was broadcast on PBS' Create. In Essential Pepin (2011), P√©pin brings modern touches to some of his favorite recipes from his career. In the 26-part public television series, P√©pin demonstrates more than 125 dishes while the companion book, published by Houghton-Mifflin, contains more than 700 recipes. In this series, P√©pin cooks with his daughter, Claudine, wife of chef Rolland Wesen. All of his programs have been produced by KQED-TV in San Francisco. P√©pin was a guest judge on season five of the Bravo television show Top Chef, which aired in 2008. He stated that his ideal \\"final meal\\" would be roast squab and fresh peas. P√©pin was a guest on the television show Wahlburgers episode called \\"Pauli Day\\". Donnie Wahlberg arranged for P√©pin to surprise his brother Paul Wahlberg for his birthday. In 2015, his television series Jacques P√©pin Heart & Soul began airing. According to its producer, Tina Salter KQED- TV, the series would be his \\"most personal and special, revealing a man ‚Äì a legend ‚Äì whose lust for life, love of food, family and friends continues\\". The series premiered on KQED on September 12, 2015, and nationally on September 19. A documentary about his life, Jacques P√©pin: The Art of Craft, aired as part of the PBS series American Masters, premiering May 26, 2017. The film, narrated by Stanley Tucci, was produced and directed by Peter L. Stein, who had produced several of P√©pin's early television cooking series at KQED in the 1990s. Awards and honors In addition to the Daytime Emmy Award won with Julia Child, P√©pin has received three of the French government's honors: He is a Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (1997) and a Chevalier de L'Ordre du M√©rite Agricole (1992). In October 2004, he received France's L√©gion d'honneur. He has also received 24 James Beard Foundation awards. On May 13, 2010, P√©pin, along with other chefs from The French Culinary Institute (known as The International Culinary Center), Alain Sailhac, Jacques Torres and Andr√© Soltner, prepared a $30,000-per-couple dinner for President Barack Obama‚Äôs fund-raiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee at Manhattan‚Äôs St. Regis Hotel. On February 5, 2010, during the christening of MS Marina, P√©pin was named an honorary commodore of the Oceania Cruises fleet, for which he serves as Executive Culinary Director. He received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Boston University on May 22, 2011. In October 2011, P√©pin was the recipient of the first-ever tribute dinner at the New York Food and Wine Festival. Cooking for P√©pin at the event, hosted by Martha Stewart, were French chefs Alain Ducasse, Daniel Boulud, and others. In May 2017, P√©pin received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Columbia University. Personal life P√©pin and his wife Gloria have been married since 1966. They have one daughter, Claudine (b. 1968). In 1974, P√©pin was badly injured while driving on a country road when a deer leaped in front of his car and he swerved to avoid it. His car hit the deer, veered off the road, struck a telephone pole, then crashed into a ravine and landed upside-down and on fire. He fractured 14 bones in his back, pelvis, and arms, and his left arm was so badly injured that physicians initially wanted to amputate it. P√©pin recovered, but his left shoulder remained limited in mobility and his left arm is several inches shorter than his right.

On the battlefield, served as army standards, even though this usage was not universal and uniquely designed army standards were just as common as -based standards (cf. , ). were also adapted by various organizations, such as merchant and artisan guilds, temples and shrines, theater troupes and even criminal gangs. In an illiterate society, they served as useful symbols for recognition. Japanese traditional formal attire generally displays the of the wearer. Commoners without often used those of their patron or the organization they belonged to. In cases when none of those were available, they sometimes used one of the few which were seen as \\"vulgar\\", or invented or adapted whatever they wished, passing it on to their descendants. It was not uncommon for shops, and therefore shop-owners, to develop to identify themselves. Rules regulating the choice and use of were somewhat limited, though the selection of was generally determined by social customs. It was considered improper to use a that was known to be held by someone else, and offensive to use a that was held by someone of a high rank. When came into conflict, the lower-ranked person sometimes changed their to avoid offending their superior. The held by the ruling clans of Japan, such as 's hollyhock and the Emperor's chrysanthemum , were legally protected from unauthorized usage. Occasionally, patron clans granted the use of their to their retainers as a reward. Similar to the granting of the patron's surnames, this was considered a very high honor.

The degree of variation tolerated differ from to as well. For example, the paulownia crest with 5-7-5 leaves is reserved for the prime minister, whereas paulownia with fewer leaves could be used by anyone. The imperial chrysanthemum also specifies 16 petals, whereas chrysanthemum with fewer petals are used by other lesser imperial family members. Japanese heraldry does not have a cadency or quartering system, but it is not uncommon for cadet branches of a family to choose a slightly different from the senior branch.

It is also called caretaker speech, infant-directed speech (IDS), child-directed speech (CDS), child-directed language (CDL), caregiver register, parentese, or motherese. CDS is characterized by a \\"sing song\\" pattern of intonation that differentiates it from the more monotone style used with other adults e.g., CDS has higher and wider pitch, slower speech rate and shorter utterances. It can display vowel hyperarticulation (an increase in distance in the formant space of the peripheral vowels e.g., [i], [u], and [a]) and words tend to be shortened and simplified. There is evidence that the exaggerated pitch modifications are similar to the affectionate speech style employed when people speak to their pets (pet-directed speech). However, the hyperarticulation of vowels appears to be related to the propensity for the infant to learn language, as it is not exaggerated in speech to infants with hearing loss or to pets. Terminology  * The first documented use of the word baby-talk, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was in 1836. * Motherese and parentese are more precise terms than baby talk, and perhaps more amenable to computer searches, but are not the terms of choice among child development professionals. Critics of gender stereotyping also prefer parentesehttp://www.earlyliteracylearning.org/cellpract_parent/infants/PG_1_I_Talk2Me.pdf to the term motherese, because all caregivers, are not only female parents, both sexes use distinct speech patterns and vocabulary when talking to young children. Motherese can also refer to English spoken in a higher, gentler manner, which is otherwise correct English, as opposed to the non-standard, shortened word forms. *Child-directed speech (CDS) is the term preferred by researchers, psychologists and child development professionals. *Infant- directed speech (IDS) is also used. The terms are interchangeable. *Caregiver language is sometimes used. Characteristics CDS is a clear and simplified strategy for communicating to younger children, used by adults and by older children. The vocabulary is limited, speech is slowed with a greater number of pauses, and the sentences are short and grammatically simplified, often repeated. Although CDS features marked auditory characteristics, other factors aid in development of language. Three types of modifications occur to adult- directed speech in the production of CDS ‚Äî * linguistic modifications, particularly prosody, including the simplification of speech units as well as the emphasis on various phonemes. * modifications to attention-gaining strategies, providing visual cues through body language (kinesics), particularly movements of the face, to more effectively maintain the attention of their infants. * modifications to the interactions between parents and infants. Parents use CDS not only to promote language development but to foster a positive relationship with their infants. The younger the child, the more exaggerated the adult's CDS is. The attention of infants is held more readily by CDS over normal speech, as with adults. The more expressive CDS is, the more likely infants are to respond to this method of communication by adults. A key visual aspect of CDS is the movement of the lips. One characteristic is the wider opening of the mouth present in those using CDS versus adult-directed speech, particularly in vowels. Research suggests that with the larger opening of the lips during CDS, infants are better able to grasp the message being conveyed due to the heightened visual cues. Through this interaction, infants are able to determine who positive and encouraging caregivers will be in their development. When infants use CDS as a determinant of acceptable caregivers, their cognitive development seems to thrive because they are being encouraged by adults who are invested in the development of the given infants. Because the process is interactive, caregivers are able to make significant progress through the use of CDS. Purpose and implications =Use with infants= Studies have shown that from birth, infants prefer to listen to CDS, which is more effective than regular speech in getting and holding an infant's attention.Kathy L. Reschke, Ph.D. (2002), Ohio State University, \\"Baby Talk\\" Archived copy at the Library of Congress (November 22, 2006). Some researchersShore, Rima. (1997). Rethinking the brain: New insights into early development. New York: Families and Work Institute. believe that CDS is an important part of the emotional bonding process between the parents and their child, and helps the infants learn the language. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Wisconsin found that using basic ‚Äúbaby talk‚Äù may support babies in picking up words faster. Infants pay more attention when parents use CDS, which has a slower and more repetitive tone than used in regular conversation. CDS has been observed in languages other than English. Purposes and benefits of CDS include support the ability of infants to bond with their caregivers. In addition, infants begin the process of speech and language acquisition and development through CDS. Children learn fastest who receive the most acknowledgement and encouragement of what they say, who are given time and attention to speak and share, and who are questioned. Infants are able to apply this to larger words and sentences as they learn to process language. CDS aids infants in bonding to caregivers. Although infants have a range of social cues available to them regarding who will provide adequate care, CDS serves as an additional indicator as to which caregivers will provide developmental support. When adults engage in CDS with infants, they are providing positive emotion and attention, signaling to infants that they are valued. CDS can also serve as a priming tool for infants to notice the faces of their caregivers. Infants are more sensitive to the pitch and emphasized qualities of this method. Therefore, when caregivers use CDS, they expand the possibility for their infants to observe and process facial expressions. This effect could in part be due to infants associating CDS with positive facial expressions such as smiling, being more likely to respond to CDS if they expect to receive a positive response from their caregiver. CDS may promote processing of word forms, allowing infants to remember words when asked to recall them in the future. As words are repeated through CDS, infants begin to create mental representations of each word. As a result, infants who experience CDS are able to recall words more effectively than infants who do not. Infants can pick up on the vocal cues of CDS and will often pattern their babbling after it. Children of depressed mothers, who do not regularly use CDS, display delayed language development. Even when depressed mothers provide their infants with positive faces, infants do not respond to their attempts at CDS, and in turn do not benefit from this important route for language acquisition. Infants are unable to create the link between speech and visual face movements in situations such as these. When fathers who are not depressed are able to provide the stimulation of CDS, infants respond well and are able to compensate from the deficit left by their mothers. This too can inhibit language and speech development. Therefore, this deficit can be especially harmful to infants with depressed mothers and little contact with male caregivers. Socioeconomic status has been found to influence the development of vocabulary and language skills. Lower-status groups tend to be behind the development of children in higher-status families. This finding is thought to be due to the amount of time parents spend with the child and the ways they interact; mothers from higher-status groups are found to say more to their children, use more variety, and speak in longer sentences. Aid to cognitive development Shore and others believe that CDS contributes to mental development as it helps teach the child the basic function and structure of language. Studies have found that responding to an infant's babble with meaningless babble aids the infant's development; while the babble has no logical meaning, the verbal interaction demonstrates to the child the bidirectional nature of speech, and the importance of verbal feedback. Some experts advise that parents should not talk to young children solely in baby talk, but should integrate some normal adult speech as well. The high-pitched sound of CDS gives it special acoustic qualities which may appeal to the infant. CDS may aid a child in the acquisition and/or comprehension of language-particular rules which are otherwise unpredictable; an example is the reduction or avoidance of pronoun reversal errors. It has been also suggested that motherese is crucial for children to acquire the ability to ask questions. =Use with non-infants= The use of baby talk is not limited to interactions between adults and infants, as it may be used among adults, or by people to animals. In these instances, the outward style of the language may be that of baby talk, but is not considered actual \\"parentese\\", as it serves a different linguistic function (see pragmatics). Patronizing / derogatory baby talk Baby talk and imitations of it may be used by one non-infant to another as a form of verbal abuse, in which the talk is intended to infantilize the victim. This can occur during bullying, when the aggressor uses baby talk to assert that the victim is weak, cowardly, overemotional, or otherwise inferior.Green, Alison (May, 2018) Ask a Manager \\"Ask a Manager\\" Flirtatious baby talk Baby talk may be used as a form of flirtation between sexual or romantic partners. In this instance, the baby talk may be an expression of tender intimacy, and may perhaps form part of affectionate sexual roleplaying in which one partner speaks and behaves childishly, while the other acts motherly or fatherly, responding in \\"parentese\\". One or both partners might perform the child role. Terms of endearment, such as poppet (or, indicatively, baby), may be used for the same purpose in communication between the partners. Baby talk with pets Many people speak to their dogs as if they were another human being. These actions are not providing communication with the dog, but social interactions for the speaker, usually in order to solve some problem. The speaking style people use when talking to dogs is very similar to CDL, and has been referred to as Doggerel. People tend to use sentences of around 11 words when talking to another adult; this is reduced to four words when speaking to a dog. People employ more imperatives or commands to a dog, but ask twice as many questions of the dog as of other humans, even though they do not expect the dog to answer. Recordings show that 90% of pet-talk is spoken mostly in the present tense because people talk to dogs about what is happening now rather than the past or the future, which is twice as much as with humans. Also, people are 20 times more likely to repeat or rephrase themselves to dogs than they do to humans. A significant difference is that CDL contains many more sentences about specific bits of information, such as \\"This cup is red,\\" because they are intended to teach children about language and the environment. Pet-speech contains perhaps half the sentences of this form, as rather than instructive, its primary purpose is as a social function for humans; whether the dog learns anything does not seem to be a concern. As well as the raised vocal pitch, pet-speech strongly emphasizes intonations and emotional phrasing. There are diminutives such as \\"walkie\\" for walk and \\"bathie\\" for bath. Although there is no evidence that speaking to a dog in this manner helps the dog understand what is being said, there is evidence suggesting that talking to dogs in a normal, purposeful, and meaningful manner improves their receptive language abilities. Foreigner talk When addressing a listener not skilled in the speaker's language, people may simplify their spoken language in an attempt to improve understanding. Some use sign language to communicate with others, especially if they have a hearing problem, although this is not always understood by people, as some signs in sign language may be difficult to interpret by some people, especially if gestures have different meanings from place to place, so they may use a baby talk-like language to communicate, skipping out small words and possibly using demonstratives instead of pronouns, for example Do not cross the road becoming No cross road. While this kind of simplifications could be helpful for, say, foreign tourists, this type of communication is perceived as rude or offensive in some societies, because it may cause the foreigner to feel infantilized. It can also be considered insulting if the foreigner is skilled in the speaker's language. While not considered to be actual parentese, it has aspects which make the two language styles similar. Universality and differences by region Researchers Bryant and Barrett (2007) have suggested (as have others before them, e.g., Fernald, 1992) that CDL exists universally across all cultures and is a species- specific adaptation. Other researchers contend that it is not universal among the world's cultures, and argue that its role in helping children learn grammar has been overestimated, pointing out that in some societies (such as certain Samoan tribes), adults do not speak to their children at all until the children reach a certain age. Furthermore, even where baby-talk is used, it has many complicated grammatical constructions, and mispronounced or non- standard words. Other evidence suggests that baby talk is not a universal phenomenon: for example Schieffelin & Ochs (1983) describe the Kaluli tribe of Papua New Guinea who do not typically employ CDS. Language acquisition in Kaluli children was not found to be significantly impaired. The extent to which caregivers rely on and use CDS differs based on cultural differences. Mothers in regions that display predominately introverted cultures are less likely to display a great deal of CDS, although it is still used. Further, the personality of each child experiencing CDS from a caregiver deeply impacts the extent to which a caregiver will use this method of communication. CDS has been seen in other languages such as Japanese, Italian, Mandarin, British English, American English, French, and German. This is the basis for claims that CDS is a necessary aspect of social development for children. Although found in many cultures, CDS is far from universal in terms of style and amount of use. A factor found to influence the way adults communicate with children is the way the culture views children. For example, if they view children as helpless and unable to understand, adults tend to interact with children less than if they believe that children are capable of learning and understanding. Often, cultures lacking a form of CDS make up for it in other ways, such as involving the children more in everyday activities, though the reverse might also be a valid assessment. Vocabulary and structure =Vocabulary= With respect to English-speaking parents, it is well-established that Anglo-Saxon or Germanic words tend to predominate in informal speech registers, whereas Latinate vocabulary is usually reserved for more formal uses such as legal and scientific texts. Child-directed speech, an informal speech register, also tends to use Anglo-Saxon vocabulary. The speech of mothers to young children has a higher percentage of native Anglo-Saxon verb tokens than speech addressed to adults. In particular, in parents‚Äô CDS the clausal core is built in the most part by Anglo-Saxon verbs, namely, almost all tokens of the grammatical relations subject-verb, verb-direct object and verb-indirect object that young children are presented with, are constructed with native verbs.Ninio, A. (2011). Syntactic development, its input and output. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Introduction accessible at The Anglo-Saxon verb vocabulary consists of short verbs, but its grammar is relatively complex. Syntactic patterns specific to this sub-vocabulary in present-day English include periphrastic constructions for tense, aspect, questioning and negation, and phrasal lexemes functioning as complex predicates, all of which occur also in CDS. As noted above, baby talk often involves shortening and simplifying words, with the possible addition of slurred words and nonverbal utterances, and can invoke a vocabulary of its own. Some utterances are invented by parents within a particular family unit, or are passed down from parent to parent over generations, while others are quite widely known and used within most families, such as wawa for water, num-num for a meal, ba-ba for bottle, or beddy-bye for bedtime, and are considered standard or traditional words, possibly differing in meaning from place to place. Baby talk, language regardless, usually consists of a muddle of words, including names for family members, names for animals, eating and meals, bodily functions and genitals, sleeping, pain, possibly including important objects such as diaper, blanket, pacifier, bottle, etc., and may be sprinkled with nonverbal utterances, such as goo goo ga ga. The vocabulary of made-up words, such as those listed below, may be quite long with terms for a large number of things, rarely or possibly never using proper language, other times quite short, dominated by real words, all nouns. Most words invented by parents have a logical meaning, although the nonverbal sounds are usually completely meaningless and just fit the speech together. Sometimes baby talk words escape from the nursery and get into adult vocabulary, for example \\"nanny\\" for \\"children's nurse\\" or \\"nursery governess\\". = Diminutives = Moreover, many words can be derived into baby talk following certain rules of transformation. In English, adding a terminal /i/ sound at the end, usually written and spelled as ‚Äπie‚Ä∫, ‚Äπy‚Ä∫, or ‚Äπey‚Ä∫, is a common way to form a diminutive which is often used as part of baby talk. Many languages have their own unique form of diminutive suffix (see list of diminutives by language for international examples). =Duplications= Still other transformations, but not in all languages, include elongated vowels, such as kitty and kiiiitty, (emphasized /i/) meaning the same thing. While this is understood by English speaking toddlers, it is not applicable with Dutch toddlers as they learn that elongated vowels reference different words.

Men is one of the five strikes in kendo (along with tsuki, d≈ç, hidari kote and migi kote). It is a long slashing stroke that falls on the centre-line of the head. Men also designates the movement, the target, and the part of the kendo armour that covers the whole head. The kiai for this strike, as for all strikes in kendo, is the name of the target area. The men strike is executed as a vertical slash in numerous ways. The basic technique is to raise the shinai or sword such that it is forty-five degrees from the vertical behind the swordsman's head, with the tip either directly above the tsuba or directly above the right point of the acromion (as viewed from the front), and the left hand exactly one fist from the forehead. From this position, power is given from the left hand to bring the sword down. At the point at which the shinai strikes the opponent, both right and left hands should be squeezed for a second which is called tenouchi, (Êâã„ÅÆÂÜÖ) also the right arm must be exactly parallel with the ground and at shoulder height. The shoulders should be relaxed. At the moment of the strike, both hands should flex inwards in a movement called shibori, (Áµû„Çä) the Japanese verb for \\"to wring out (a cloth)\\". This flexion should only be maintained for an instant. It serves to make the strike clean, fast, and bring the shinai off the target area such that a follow-up strike can be made with great ease. Sa-yu men (Â∑¶Âè≥Èù¢) strikes - or hidari (left, Â∑¶) and migi (right, Âè≥) men, respectively - are variants on the men strike and are made at points either fifteen degrees to the left or right of centreline as drawn from the point between the eyes to the top of the head. This strike is made only with a subtle variation on the basic men technique. The tip is simply directed slightly more left or right as it is cocked back into the ready position. Men is the first and most practiced strike in kendo. It is a favourable attack for those with a height advantage.

The character is an enemy of both the Barry Allen and Wally West versions of the Flash. Created by writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino, Captain Boomerang first appeared in The Flash #117 (December 1960). He has also been a prominent member of the Suicide Squad since its second iteration in the late 1990s. During the 2004 storyline Identity Crisis, George Harkness is killed and his son, Owen Mercer, takes over his father's role as Captain Boomerang for a period of time. However, during the 2009‚Äì2010 Blackest Night storyline, Owen is killed and Harkness returns to life, resuming his role as Captain Boomerang. Digger Harkness was portrayed in the Arrowverse by Nick E. Tarabay, and by Jai Courtney in the DC Extended Universe films Suicide Squad and its upcoming sequel. Publication history Digger Harkness first appeared in The Flash #117 (December 1960) and was created by writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino. Throughout the first several years of the character's existence, Captain Boomerang spoke with an American accent. Beginning in the late 1980s, he developed an Australian accent. Owen Mercer first appeared in Identity Crisis #2 (2004) and was created by Brad Meltzer and Rags Morales. Fictional character biographies =Digger Harkness= George Harkness's debut as Captain Boomerang on the cover of Flash #117 (Dec. 1960). Secretly the illegitimate son of an American soldier and an Australian woman, Harkness was raised in an Australian town called Korumburrahttps://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Kurrumburra in poverty, during which time he developed great skill in making boomerangs, and in using them as weapons. As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father. It was at this time that he developed the Captain Boomerang persona that he would continue to use in his later criminal career. Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime. When he began committing crimes, he threw suspicion off himself by briefly pretending another man was impersonating him, showing his 'parents', (really other crooks) to the Flash after the Flash caught him next to a crime scene. He nearly succeeded in killing the Flash after knocking him out with a boomerang, then tying him to a giant boomerang that he fired, which then got sent into space and then fell into the ocean. However, the Flash was able to escape from his friction-proof bonds by quickly vibrating his molecules. He also increased the boomerang's velocity so much he was able to use it to defeat and jail Harkness and the two crooks. He became a recurring enemy of the Flash, typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects (some would explode, others had razor-sharp edges, etc.), and using them ruthlessly. He became a staple member of the Rogues, a group of villains dedicated to opposing Flash, and who were first organized after Gorilla Grodd broke them out of jail. Though captured when Flash made their weapons hit each other, they continued to act together. Later on, Harkness became a less-than- effective member of the Suicide Squad in exchange for being pardoned for his crimes. However, Captain Boomerang's grating personality and blatant racism (among other things, he constantly referred to black team member Bronze Tiger as an \\"Abo\\") caused considerable friction among his teammates, and he was considered to be a dangerous, vicious, cowardly and undependable member of the team‚Äîdysfunctional even by the Squad's standards and the equivalent of a class clown. Amanda Waller, the Squad's commanding officer, characterized Captain Boomerang as \\"a jerk and a screw-up\\". This was not an undeserved reputation, as, among other things, Harkness simply watched as his teammate Mindboggler was shot in the back, even while he could have easily saved her. (Mindboggler had earlier used her mind-manipulating abilities on Harkness to shut him up when he was verbally abusing another team member.) He also manipulated another team member, Slipknot, into running away from the action just to see if the explosive bracelets the Squad members wore really did activate if the wearer attempted to escape (unfortunately for Slipknot, they did). He was scared to learn Ifrit, an artificial intelligence used by the rival team the Onslaught, had been created based upon Mindboggler's thought patterns, and revealed what had happened. While in the Squad, Harkness also briefly took up the mantle of Mirror Master to commit robberies. However, this career was cut short when he was caught and brought to Waller, who put an end to it by tricking him into a fake assault scene where he was forced to change constantly between Mirror Master and Captain Boomerang. She rescinded the benefits Harkness had been given such as his apartment in New Orleans and his status as a voluntary member of the Squad. Many times Digger would have to be tricked into battle, but when faced with enemies he proved more than competent in upholding his end of the fight. Harkness also would play a few undercover roles for the Squad, convincingly managing to be other slimy, criminal types. Later, Digger would try a simple series of pranks for amusement, hitting various members of the Squad with pies. For a time, suspicion had been diverted from him because he had used his skills to pie himself, seemingly being hit by the 'assailant' from behind a wall. When the Squad confronted Digger as the culprit, he lost his temper and shouted that they could not really punish him since he was already in prison and in the Suicide Squad. He asked Waller, \\"What are you going to do about it, Fat Lady?!\\" Waller dropped him from a helicopter onto a deserted island. Due to various events, mainly Waller breaking many rules by having a criminal gang ruthlessly gunned down, the Squad broke up for a year. When Waller was approached again because she was needed, she reformed the team and had Digger picked up. He was, at the time, trying to construct a massive boomerang to take him back to the mainland. Harkness revealed a deep patriotism for his home country of Australia, though his countrymen do not care at all for him, and a tremendous fear of being laughed at. Teammate Deadshot commented he often wished he had killed Harkness, most notably after his drinking led them to miss a plane and to Deadshot losing his uniform and entering a depressive phase because of it. Ironically, when Boomerang pulled strings to have the suit restored to Deadshot, Lawton's psyche had passed into a phase that led him to loathe it. Harkness remained with the Squad until it was disbanded after a successful mission in Diabloverde. However, despite being a somewhat trusted employee, Harkness still was quite amoral and greedy, selling out Adam Cray, the Atom, for half a million dollars. Digger later showed up in Superboy with another Squad. While on a mission to destroy an underwater criminal hideout, he was shot through the hands by Deadshot and apparently fell to his death. He later appeared in the pages of Flash with cybernetic hands alongside four other Rogues; they were given a chance by fellow Rogue Abra Kadabra to become much more than they ever were. Unfortunately for Captain Boomerang, Captain Cold, Mirror Master, Weather Wizard, and Heat Wave, Kadabra's promise of glory was actually a ruse to free Neron and empower himself. Neron then resurrects the five Rogues, superpowering them and sending them on a bloody rampage that destroys much of Flash's hometown and kills thousands. Eventually, the Flash and Linda Park free the Rogues; the dead are restored to life. After being restored to life, Boomerang and the Rogues, along with the Trickster, sought out an artifact that would protect them from Neron should he ever take an interest in them again. The Trickster accompanied them to help an old ex-girlfriend recover her kidnapped son. In the end, the Trickster found the boy, who turned out to not only be the prophesied agent of a god, but also the Trickster's son. He was also able to convince Neron to leave the Rogues alone, with the Rogues either coming away darker from their experiences, or seeking enlightenment, like Heat Wave, who retired with the monks. Captain Boomerang is also involved with the Joker: Last Laugh event. After having suffered a mishap with one of his exploding boomerangs, Digger is transferred by ambulance to Keystone City. En route, the ambulance is attacked by a Jokerized Deadshot, who decides to lend his old pal a hand by injecting him with Joker's serum. The serum's healing factor revives Digger, who is cured of his massive full-body burns and ready to attack the Flash at Iron Heights prison. However, once there, he is choked unconscious by a Jokerized Pied Piper. Captain Boomerang was killed in the Identity Crisis miniseries by Jack Drake, father of Tim Drake. Digger had been sent by the real killer to attack Jack Drake, only the killer double-crossed Digger and sent Drake a warning and a pistol to defend himself. The killer later defended the action by saying that Boomerang was hired because he was such an incompetent that Jack would only need to pull the trigger and he would be safe. Digger managed to kill Drake but not before he was shot himself.Identity Crisis #5 (December 2004) Digger was later temporarily revived by Agent James Jesse, the former Trickster, during the Rogue War storyline, when Jesse used unspecified technology to temporarily revive Boomerang in an attempt to find out information about the Rogues' current hideout. However, Jesse was called away due to the latest attack by the Rogues before Harkness's revival, meaning that the only person present when Harkness was briefly reanimated was Ashley Zolomon, the estranged wife of Hunter Zolomon (a former Reverse-Flash), who had been brought in based on her expertise in dealing with Rogues. During his brief return to life, Harkness asked Ashley to tell his son that he loved him and warn him never to reveal his mother's real name out of fear that the Rogues would kill him. In the Blackest Night crossover, his remains are reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, and he joins the reanimated Jack and Janet Drake, John and Mary Grayson, Tony Zucco, and the original Batman's deceased rogues gallery members in an attempt to take the life of the current Batman and Red Robin. They are met with interference from Deadman, who had possessed the body of Etrigan the Demon. Their attack is ultimately called off when Batman and Red Robin cryogenically freeze themselves, leaving no emotions for the Black Lanterns to target.Blackest Night: Batman #3 (December 2009) Harkness later joins other reanimated members of the Rogues to target their still-living members.Blackest Night: The Flash #1 (December 2009) However, the battle results in a draw on both side.

The Rogues track Owen down, Captain Cold berating him on how foolish he is to believe Digger's lies. When they discover the remains of a family nearby, Captain Cold reminds Owen that \\"the Rogues don't kill women or children.\\" He shoves Owen into the pit where Digger rips out his son's heart. A black ring then flies down to make Owen a Black Lantern. The Black Lantern Harkness and his son are then encased in ice by Captain Cold.Blackest Night: The Flash #3 (February 2010) Digger manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life and rejuvenated.

Boomerang releases him, in hopes that Zoom might help him better understand his version of the Entity's message. However, Professor Zoom refused to answer and escaped as Digger was confronted by the Rogues.The Flash (vol. 3) #7 (December 2010) Captain Cold beats up Digger for freeing Professor Zoom, then Digger explains to him the importance of the Entity's message.Brightest Day #18 (January 2011) Later, Captain Boomerang is contacted once again by the Entity, who tells him that he must complete his task, prompting Digger to travel to Star City forest, which by now is surrounded by a white barrier. While there, Captain Boomerang discovers that he's the only one who can enter the forest.Brightest Day #23 (April 2011) Within the forest, Captain Boomerang finds Dawn and throws a boomerang at her. Hawk, however, fails to catch the boomerang and instead, the boomerang is caught by Deadman, who ended up dying in the process and Hawk is left to knock Captain Boomerang unconscious. After the Entity proclaims Captain Boomerang has completed his task, and his life is restored to him, the Entity reveals to them that the boomerang was part of a plan to free Hawk from his role as an avatar of war from the Lords of Chaos: his act of saving Dawn would have broken the hold the Lords of Chaos have on Hawk and allow Hank to be true to himself.Brightest Day #24 (April 2011) In the aftermath of Brightest Day, Captain Boomerang lost his White Lantern abilities. However, as he seeks out a way to regain this lost power, he is prevented by Red Robin, who is stalking him.

He tells the team that he is the new field commander for the Suicide Squad upon being placed in that position by Amanda Waller.Suicide Squad (vol. 4) #3 (January 2012) But this is further revealed to be a set-up orchestrated to give them a bargaining chip to bypass an armed Basilisk militia led by the sister of one of his victims. Realizing the trap, Boomerang attempts to use a detonator he was given that is supposed to be connected to the microbombs in each Squad member's skin. It fails to function, and Deadshot mocks him for thinking that Waller would trust him with that kind of power before shooting his hand.Suicide Squad (vol. 4) #4 (February 2012) It is later revealed in the series that Captain Boomerang is working for Basilisk as the Suicide Squad is captured. Captain Boomerang is seen escorting the squad to the concentration camps of the Basilisk militia. Captain Boomerang frees Deadshot and the rest of the Squad and reveals that he was Waller's undercover agent. While battling the militia, Captain Boomerang is knocked out by Black Spider, who is revealed as the traitor on the team. In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Captain Boomerang and his fellow Rogues are among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by Riddler that talks about the Superman Theory. When some villains were talking about relocating to Kahndaq, Captain Boomerang mentions that the Suicide Squad went M.I.A. during an assassination assignment there where Captain Boomerang mentions that he barely made it out of Kahndaq alive.Doomsday Clock #6 (July 2018). DC Comics. =Owen Mercer= At the beginning of the 2004 Identity Crisis storyline, \\"Digger\\" Harkness a.k.a. Captain Boomerang found himself an obsolete villain in the modern world of supervillains. Regularly going up to the supervillain satellite looking for jobs, asking favors from the Calculator, he was at the end of his rope looking for a job to put him on the map again. During this time he felt it was finally time to reach out to the son he never raised, Owen Mercer. Before Harkness's death, the two bonded. Taking up his father's legacy, he became the second Captain Boomerang. Captain Cold, brother to Golden Glider (who was believed to be Owen's mother), took Owen in as one of the Rogues. Though Owen initially had no real attachment to the Rogues (and even voiced various, albeit short, opinions out loud), he grew to enjoy the purpose and sense of family the team offered after finding that his father's body had been stolen for use in a lab (which was later revealed to be part of a plan to get memories from Harkness). Around this time the Rogue War storyline began, in which the \\"reformed\\" Rogues fought the Rogues under Captain Cold. Ashley Zolomon is told by Harkness himself (he is briefly revived by the \\"reformed\\" Rogues as part of an experiment) that Golden Glider is not Owen's real mother. Later, it is revealed in Flash #225 (January 2006) that Meloni Thawne is the mother of Owen Harkness, formerly Owen Mercer, the new Captain Boomerang, having conceived him by the original Boomerang while he was trapped in the 30th Century. It is unknown whether she gave birth to Bart Allen or Owen first, or how Owen made it back to our own time. During the 2005‚Äì2006 Infinite Crisis storyline, Owen was part of Alexander Luthor Jr.'s group of villains. He, Captain Cold, and Mirror Master were sent to guard a factory against the Outsiders, under the command of Deathstroke (who was actually Arsenal in disguise). When the ensuing battle between Outsiders and Rogues destroyed the machinery in the factory, the Rogues and other villains would not help in the fight at all and then at the explosion, he is saved by the Outsiders, while the Rogues left them at the base to blow up. He is then turned over to the authorities off-panel. During the 52 series, Owen is part of a Suicide Squad sent by Amanda Waller to attack Black Adam. In the 2006 One Year Later storyline, Owen finds himself placed in the metahuman prison known as Iron Heights. There he finds himself being the cellmate of Black Lightning, who was arrested for a murder that Deathstroke the Terminator committed. It is soon discovered that the other inmates have learned of Black Lightning's identity and are planning to murder him. The Outsiders become aware of this and attempt to break Pierce out of jail. Unfortunately it goes terribly wrong. As they escape, Black Lightning asks that they take Owen with them, which they grudgingly agree. As they escape, the Outsiders' jet, the Pequod, is shot down, and while the team escapes, the world believes them dead. Because of this event and the Freedom of Power Treaty, the team now works covertly. Most of the current Outsiders were believed dead until a botched mission revealed their presence to the world. His history as a Rogue has been exploited several times by team leader Nightwing from torturing dictators to taking down a cloned Jay Garrick. However, it is revealed that his desire to join the Outsiders comes from his desire for a family. Nightwing allowed him to join his team partially because Arsenal felt he would be worthy, and because Owen has been striving to find a family since the death of his father and the outbreak of the Rogue War. Owen searched out the current Robin because of their connection, where their fathers killed one another. While Robin originally believed Owen was searching for him in order to finish the fight his father started, in Robin #152, Owen revealed that he wished to make amends with the younger hero, and has offered his assistance to help Robin destroy a bomb created by the Joker. The two later spend the following night spreading out old hideouts of several villains. Afterward, Robin gained a bit of civil respect for Boomerang despite what their fathers did to one another. Boomerang attempted to shake hands with Robin, but Robin refused the gesture feeling unready to make that step. At some point during his tenure with the Outsiders, Captain Cold approached the mercenary Deathstroke with an offer concerning Owen. In exchange for kidnapping Deathstroke's daughter Rose (who had betrayed her father and joined the Teen Titans) and delivering her to her father, Deathstroke would track down the Outsiders and turn Owen over to the Rogues. The villains planned to force Owen to cooperate with the team by administering the same mind-controlling agent that Deathstroke had used on his daughter as well as Batman's partner Cassandra Cain. However, this plan fell apart when Rose escaped and helped the Teen Titans defeat the Rogues, which led to Deathstroke backing out of the deal.Teen Titans: Cold Case (February 2011) Owen has also developed a close friendship with Supergirl, Kara Zor-El. After Supergirl returned from her time away with Power Girl, Kara began looking to start a normal life on Earth and went out a 'date' with Owen, during which they spoke of their past problems. Kara has nicknamed Owen 'Boomer'. Although the pair often flirts with one another, they have never progressed to a romantic relationship. This comes primarily from the fact that Kara continues to show interest in Nightwing, and jokingly says that what she and Owen has is more of a brother-sister relationship, in which he has an unhealthy fixation on his 'little sis'. Feeling rejected after Kara's relationship with Power Boy, Owen goes to a bar where he meets Cassandra Cain (Batgirl), who at the time was being mind controlled by Deathstroke the Terminator, and who had been hired to kill Supergirl. Cassandra kidnaps and tortures Owen to lure Supergirl. Unfortunately, this proves unnecessary, as Kara had tracked down Cassandra on her own, without any knowledge of Owen's kidnapping. Batgirl nearly manages to defeat Supergirl, but is defeated when Kara grows Krypton Sunstones which impale her foe. Kara then rushes Owen to the hospital where he is treated. While still in medical care, it is discovered that Power Boy has been stalking Kara. Following Kara's rather violent break-up with Power Boy, the Earth was overtaken by spirits from the Phantom Zone, which began to emerge from within Superman. Kara managed to defeat the Phantoms and return the Earth to normal. Afterwards, in Supergirl #19 Kara begins to make amends with all the people who she has hurt since arriving on earth. Amongst them, Boomer, to whom she apologises for letting him get hurt and leading him on. During this conversation, the matter of Owen's relationship with Kara is finally clarified. When asked by Kara how he feels about her leading him on, Owen replies, \\"Well, if I may ... for me to have been 'led on' would presume I thought I had a shot with you ... For me to think I had a shot with a sixteen- year-old girl -- crystal-powered hypersleep whatever junk aside ... that would mean I am a dirtbag with a thing for jailbait. Which I am not\\". In Checkmate #13-15, crossover with Outsiders #47-49, Checkmate abducts all members of the Outsiders except Nightwing, allowing him to infiltrate their headquarters in order to offer them a deal: The Outsiders won't be shut down over their actions in Africa in exchange for infiltrating Oolong Island on behalf of Checkmate. During the operation, Nightwing, Owen, and Checkmate's Black Queen are taken captive by Chang Tzu, and the latter two are tortured and experimented on. After Batman rescues the Outsiders over North Korean territory, and Nightwing hands over the team to him, Owen and Nightwing are paired with each other in \\"auditions\\" for the new line up. Pushed too far, feeling he does not need to prove himself anymore, Owen returns to the Suicide Squad although Batman feels he could make a good double agent. In All Flash #1, Owen as part of the new Suicide Squad captures two of the Rogues that are responsible for Bart Allen's murder, Heat Wave and Weather Wizard, in Louisiana. In Countdown #39, he and the rest of the Squad chase after Piper and Trickster in Gotham City after they had escaped capture from Squad member Deadshot. The Squad however, is just as unsuccessful as Deadshot, and the two Rogues escape capture. Owen visits his father's grave along with Tar Pit, when the swarm of black rings fly into the crypt and reanimate all the deceased villains as Black Lanterns, including his father. The Rogues battle in the Iron Heights, when the battle resulted in a draw on both sides, Owen arrives and abducts Digger from the battle, believing he can bring his father back. Later on, Owen has apparently chained up his father's body and is feeding him victims such as a villain named Sandblast who was relying on Owen to get him into the Rogues. It is revealed that Owen has been deceived by Boomerang into believing the blood of enough victims can bring him back to life. The Rogues track Owen down with Captain Cold berating him for believing Harkness' lies. Realizing that Owen has broken the Rogues' code of honor by killing women and children, Cold shoves him into the pit. Owen has his heart ripped out by his father, with a ring flying in to revive him as a Black Lantern. The Black Lantern Owen and his father are then encased in ice by Cold. His father manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life and full health. Powers and abilities Captain Boomerang carries a number of boomerangs in his satchel. He is an expert at throwing the weapons and as well as ordinary boomerangs he has a number with special properties, including bladed, explosive, incendiary, and electrified boomerangs. Upon his resurrection, Digger finds he has the ability to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on contact. However, this new ability is lost when he completes the task given by the White Lantern Entity. The original Captain Boomerang then began to train his son, Owen Mercer, before he died. He has exhibited creativity in his boomerangs by creating \\"razorangs\\" and an acid-spewing boomerang. Owen has also exhibited \\"speed bursts\\": short bursts of limited super speed over short distances, most notably when throwing boomerangs. These were even possible during the time period that Bart Allen fully contained the Speed Force, usually displayed as his ability to throw boomerangs at high velocities, rather than running.Outsiders (vol. 3) #36 (July 2006) However, during Chang Tzu's experiments, he claimed he believed Mercer could access the Speed Force, and Mercer denied having super speed at all anymore, but Chang Tzu was able to activate Owen's speed involuntarily, causing him great pain.Checkmate (vol. 2) #15 (August 2007) The exact source of this power remains unrevealed. Regardless, as of Justice Society of America #8, the Speed Force appears to have returned and is accessible to all former speedsters once more.

Captain Boomerang joins up with other Central City villains to destroy The Flash. In that episode, he appears in a streamlined, trench-coated version of his traditional costume. In both appearances, Boomerang's character is defined by his fiscal frugality; in the former, he almost gives Task Force X away by refusing to part with his pocket change, even at the risk of setting off a metal detector (\\"75 cents is 75 cents. I'm supposed to throw away money?\\"), and in the latter, he badgers his fellow Flash rogues for cost assistance with his giant boomerang. * Captain Boomerang appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by John DiMaggio.

Harkness returns in the season five finale, \\"Lian Yu\\", where Oliver recruits him and Wilson as part of his team to face Adrian Chase and his allies.

In the film's climax, after Frost and Copperhead are killed by Waller in their fight over the \\"Get Out of Hell Free\\" card, he double-crosses the Squad and attempts to get away with the card (plus, daring Waller to kill him with the bomb in his neck as long as he has the card in his hands). Soon after that, he is stopped from getting away by a wounded but still determined Bronze Tiger. Just then, he is caught off-guard and violently beaten by Professor Zoom over the card.

C. Constantine (a pseudonym for Carl Constantine Kosak; born 1934 in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania) is an American mystery author. Little is known about Kosak, as he prefers anonymity and has given only a few interviews. He was born in 1934 and served in the Marines in the early 1950s. He lives in Greensburg, Pennsylvania with wife Linda. He is an alumnus of Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania and claims that he \\"flunked freshman composition twice\\" because he \\"did not know how to make an English sentence.\\" (As reported in the bulletin of that college's \\"Friends of the Library\\" Autumn, 1990.) Other than that, information is sketchy. He may have been a minor league baseball player (some had even been suggesting that Kosak was a pseudonym for former Major League baseball player Phil Rizzuto) and he may have studied at the University of Iowa's writers' program in the 1960s. Other evidence suggests he never got near a baseball and instead was a journalist at a western Pennsylvania newspaper. Kosak continued to work a day job until 1993, when he lost his job and turned to writing full-time. He worked for several years as an English teacher at Seton Hill University (then Seton Hill College) in Greensburg, where he taught creative writing and composition, until his refusal to complete his master's degree prompted his dismissal. His most famous creation is Mario Balzic, police chief in fictional Rocksburg, Pennsylvania. Rocksburg is a by-product of Kosak's hometown McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania as well as the cities of Greensburg, Pennsylvania and Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Kosak is much more interested in the people in his novels than the actual mystery, and his later novels become ever more philosophical, threatening to leave the mystery/detective genre behind completely. In May 2011, Kosak appeared in person for the first time at the 16th annual Festival of Mystery held at the Greek Orthodox Church in Oakmont, signing his books and giving a live interview.

History  The Cesky Terrier was created by a Czech breeder, Franti≈°ek Hor√°k, in 1948, as a cross between a Sealyham Terrier and a Scottish Terrier, to create a terrier suitable for hunting in the forests of Bohemia. Although not a trained scientist, Hor√°k worked for many years as a research assistant at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and used knowledge gained there in his dog breeding. Czechoslovakia was ruled by a communist regime at the time; when Hor√°k's dogs became more popular around the world, he began to receive a large volume of mail from outside the country, which earned him the attention of the secret police. Hor√°k died in 1997. The Cesky Terrier was recognized for international competition by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in 1963 as breed number 246 in Group 3, Terriers. The breed is now recognized by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. The Cesky Terrier is one of the six most rare dog breeds worldwide. The breed was first imported into the US in the 1980s by a group of enthusiasts. They formed the Cesky Terrier Club of America in January 1988. As interest grew, the breed became eligible to join the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service Program from January 1, 2004 allowing it to compete in AKC Earthdog tests. At this stage the American Cesky Terrier Fanciers Association was formed and recognised by the AKC. It is the club accepted as the parent club by the AKC. However, the Cesky Terrier Club of America remains active in promoting the breed in the USA. From mid-2011, the Cesky Terrier was able to compete in the terrier group in America as it was accepted for entry in the AKC Stud Book. The breed first arrived in the UK in 1989 and had to compete from the imported register. The Cesky Terrier was recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1990 and on January 1, 2000 it gained rare breed status. It has since competed successfully in show competition in the UK.  Description  = Appearance = The Cesky Terrier is a well-muscled, short legged, well-pigmented, hunting terrier of a rectangular format. The Cesky has natural drop ears, a natural tail, and sports a long, silky with slight texture coat in shades of gray from charcoal to platinum (black pigmented) or rarely brown (liver pigmented).

Not overdone with too much furnishings. Faults: Curly, Coarse or cotton-wool like texture. The Cesky Terrier is groomed by clipping and scissoring into a saddle pattern on the body, with the longer hair ending in a V on the tail. A \\"U\\" shape is cut out of the top lateral portion of the front legs and Areas of the neck, head, chest, shoulder, tail and rear thigh from the top of the V on the tail to the top of the hock and round the vent are clipped shorter to achieve this appearance and to highlight the well developed muscles of the Cesky Terrier. The Hair on the foreface from mid eye to the rear edge of the lip line is not to be clipped thus forming brows and a beard. The transition between clipped and unclipped areas should be pleasing to the eye and never abrupt. Color :The Cesky Terrier has two varieties of color: In mature dogs, 3 years or older: 1. Any shade of gray from charcoal to platinum gray with Black pigment. 2. Coffee Brown with Liver pigment. Black may appear on the head, beard, cheeks, ears, feet and tail. White, grey, brown and yellow markings are permitted on the head, beard, cheeks, neck, chest, limbs and around the vent. A white collar or white tip is permitted on the tail. The base color must always be predominant. Faults: Long brindled coat on dogs older than 2 years, white covering more than 20%, and a white blaze are disqualifying faults. Gait :The action should be free, driven and enduring. Gallop rather slow but lasting. The forelegs extend in a straight line forward. = Temperament = The breed standard calls for a calm dog, and aggression is a disqualifying fault. Cesky Terriers are reputed to be less active and quieter than other terriers. This may or may not make them suitable pets for families with children.  Care  The coat of the Cesky Terrier is not stripped (dead hair pulled out with the fingers or a special knife) as in other terriers, but rather is clippered. The body and tail are clipped, and the furnishings (hair that hangs down under the body) are left long, as is the hair on the lower legs and on the face (eyebrows, beard, and moustache.) The longer hair should be brushed daily.  Health  This breed occasionally suffers from the Scotty Cramp, a minor problem causing awkward movement, but it is not life-threatening. Breeding stock should be checked for hip dysplasia, patella luxation, cardiac abnormalities, PLL (primary lens luxation) and other eye disorders such as cataracts, thyroid issues, degenerative myelopathy, and Type 3 von Willebrand disease, all of which have been documented issues in the breed.

He was designed by children's books illustrator Victor Chizhikov. Misha is the first mascot of a sporting event to achieve large-scale commercial success in merchandise. The Misha doll was used extensively during the opening and closing ceremonies, appeared on several merchandise products and had both an animated short film (animated by Soyuzmultfilm) and a television series (animated by Nippon Animation), all of which are now common practice not only in the Olympic Games, but also in the FIFA World Cup and other events' mascots.Alpert, Lukas I..

Origins of the name Misha  In Russian, Misha is a short form for the Russian male name Mikhail (Michael), and Mishka is a diminutive of Misha. This name, in any of its forms, is a common colloquialism in Russian for a bear, because it is similar to the standard name for 'bear,' –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å (medved). Also, most anthropomorphic bears in Russian fairy tales have this name. It is thought to originate as a euphemism for medved, which was tabooed because of magical thinking that letting out the \\"true name\\" of the dangerous animal may cause it to come and attack. Medved (which means \\"honey- eater\\") itself is thought to be older Proto-Slavic euphemism for Proto-Indo- European *rÃ•k√æos.  Origins  In 1977, the committee organizing the Olympics held a contest for the best illustration of a bear. The judges chose Victor Chizhikov's design depicting a smiling bear cub wearing a blue-black-yellow- green-red (colors of the Olympic rings) weightlifter's belt, with a golden buckle shaped like the five rings. Misha's design of a small, cuddly and smiling bear cub was evidently intended to counter the \\"big and brutal Russian Bear\\". Misha was confirmed as an official mascot on 19 December 1977. Chizhikov complained that the country reneged on a promise to grant him the copyright to his bear which deprived him of royalties, although the Russian Olympic Committee stated \\"in accordance with the Olympic Charter, after Dec. 31 of the year in which the Olympic Games had been held, all the rights to the intellectual property and the symbols of the Olympics go the International Olympic Committee\\". thumb During the closing ceremony of the 1980 Olympic Games, a giant effigy of Misha the Bear holding a cluster of balloons was paraded in the stadium. On one side of the stadium where the Olympic Torch was situated, there was a placard mural of Misha which shed tears from his left eye.Bear Misha ‚Äì The Olympic Mascot 1980. English Russia.

Chizhikov noted that the Bely's facial features were all taken from Misha, saying \\"they just pumped him up and made him fatter\\". Chizhikov also complained that Bely and the other two mascots (the Hare and Leopard) was lacking personality. As a result of these issues, as well as being denied the copyright to Misha, Chizhikov declined to help when asked by the organizers of the 2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony.Mackay, Duncan.

The first games in the series were released for DOS. From Jagged Alliance 2 on, the games were developed using DirectX for native Windows operation. Jagged Alliance 2 was also released for Linux and is available on Steam and on GOG.com for Windows.  Overview  The Jagged Alliance games center on strategically controlling mercenary squads, on and off the field, who complete various missions such as freeing countries from oppressive dictators. The games feature a mix of turn- based battle simulation, 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) elements and role-playing. Humour via spoken character comments is a trademark of the series. The personalities of the individual mercenaries range from mildly eccentric to disturbed. This contrasts the games' setting which is otherwise closely linked to such subjects as war and death. Each mercenary is an individual with their own traits. Part of the strategy was the player's freedom to select a multi-faceted team to win the game in different ways. Not all teams would work; for example, Ivan and his nephew Igor, who work well together, are hated by Steroid, the Polish bodybuilder. \\"Buns\\", a Danish markswoman, hates \\"Fox\\", a medic with centerfold looks. In contrast, \\"Fox\\" loves working with \\"Grizzly,\\" on whom she has something of a crush. The mercenaries may be out on various assignments, determined randomly, so that the available pool of characters is never the same for each game. The player has to maintain a level of reputation in the Jagged Alliance games. If the player gets their troops killed often, regularly hires and dismisses members or generally is insensitive (such as not paying for deceased merc body shipments back home), their reputation will lower. Bad player's reputation affects all mercenaries. Mercs may demand a significant pay raise to consider working for the player. Hired mercenaries may quit unless the player discreetly pays them a bonus. And only desperate-for-work mercs will agree to work for really notorious players. Intellectual property The intellectual property (IP) for Jagged Alliance has been exchanged between many companies. The series and IP were created by Mad Labs Software, who later became a part of the publisher for the first game, Sir-Tech Software, Inc., along with a transfer of IP. The second game, Jagged Alliance 2, was also started by Sir- Tech. When Sir-Tech's publishing arm went bankrupt, the game rights were transferred to its development house Sir-Tech Canada and published by TalonSoft. By the time Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business was released, Sir-Tech's publishing arm was out of business and the game was released by Interplay. Subsequently TalonSoft went bankrupt. At the moment Strategy First owns the IP and has published Jagged Alliance: Wildfire. Strategy First made several attempts to extend the series with Jagged Alliance 3D and Jagged Alliance 3, both of which never saw the light of day. Strategy First was acquired by Silverstar Holdings, which then ran into financial problems and was delisted by NASDAQ. It is unclear what effect this will have on future games using the Jagged Alliance IP, though in the final SEC filing before being delisted Silverstar stated that it had reached a settlement of some issues with Russia-based Akella: \\"Akella and 3A Entertainment have the option to acquire certain intellectual property rights for the Jagged Alliance and Disciples franchises for an additional $100,000\\". The first Jagged Alliance game was developed by MadLab Software, Montreal. Qc, the following three games were developed by Sir-Tech Development based in Ottawa, Ontario. Ian Currie, Shaun Lyng and Linda Currie were the lead designers on the Jagged Alliance series. MadLab was absorbed by Sir-Tech Canada but the company shut down in late 2003.  Games in the series  = Jagged Alliance = GUI for Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games, showing the player's mercs bordering the playing field. In Jagged Alliance 2, the mercs are lined up along the bottom. Released in 1995 for MS-DOS, this first game of the series tasks the player with freeing the fictional island of Metavira from the greedy Santino. The player must recruit mercenaries as they explore, capture, and hold new territory. The natives harvest the valuable trees from which a revolutionary medicine can be extracted; a result of the island having been used as a nuclear testing ground in 1952. The more trees the player holds, the more income they make. Income can be used to hire native guards and hire more mercenaries to take the offensive and clear more sectors of enemies. This game features a top-down perspective of the game field for battles, with character portraits framing the view on the left and right sides. A separate map view shows the entire country broken up into distinct conquerable sectors.  Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games  Released in 1996, Deadly Games is a DOS sequel to the original game. It features a different format, however, and is considered by some to be more of a spin-off than a sequel. This game features the same engine and top-down perspective as the original game. = Jagged Alliance 2 = This game was released in 1999 for Windows and was later ported to Linux by Tribsoft. The mission of this second official game of the series is to free the country of Arulco from its evil dictator Queen Deidranna. Deidranna married the democratically elected King of Arulco, then launched a coup d'√©tat eight years ago, deposing her husband and taking power for herself. The player is \\"hired\\" by the exiled king, Enrico Chivaldori, to free his homeland of Deidranna's dictatorial regime. Gameplay is similar to the original grand adventure style of Jagged Alliance, but features higher- resolution graphics and an isometric pseudo-3D view of the battleground. The terrain has two height levels (ground and rooftops) for player / enemy sprites and a basic physics engine for thrown objects and ballistics. It also features \\"destructible terrain\\" in that players are able to blow open walls and buildings with explosives. The game also takes place across diverse and rather imaginative locations, including a multi-level prison facility, a school, a hospital, surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites, a swamp and a junkyard. The weapons arsenal has grown considerably to include a variety of weapons based on real-life counterparts (such as automatic weapons, shotguns, rocket launchers) and also fictional weapons like an auto firing rocket rifle. There are some more role-playing elements like specialty professions and the possibility to create a custom mercenary as well. Mercs can talk to one another during missions, usually spouting one-liners and other comments to each other. JA2 has been extensively modded by fans of the series. Most notable include, but are not limited to: v1.13, Urban Chaos, Deidranna Lives,, Renegade Republic. and JA2-Stracciatella.  Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business  Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business, alternatively known as Jagged Alliance 2.5 is a short, mission-based standalone sequel released by Sir-Tech in 2000.

They destroy Arulco's now-empty Tixa prison as an example of what happens if their demands are not met. The player must put a team of mercenaries together to infiltrate Tracona and disable the missile base.  Jagged Alliance 2: Gold Pack  Jagged Alliance 2: Gold Pack was published by Strategy First on August 6, 2002 and adds the improvements of Unfinished Business to the final release of Jagged Alliance 2. Unfinished Business and a scenario editor are also included in the package. Gold Pack introduces notable changes to the difficulty setting. The player choosing an advanced difficulty level may also decide to make the player turns timed and whether to disallow saving during combat, as opposed to the original Jagged Alliance 2, which set these settings automatically.Jagged Alliance 2: Gold game manual, p. 46.  Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire  Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire, version 5, was programmed by i-Deal Games and published by Strategy First in 2004 as an official expansion pack.

The project had started as a hobby add-on by Serge \\"WildFire\\" Popoff, who decided to make it commercial since version 4.The last free version, 3.xx, is still available for download (as of April 2011) at i-Deal Games's home site Compared to the original Jagged Alliance 2, Wildfire 5 has not altered the game engine or controls and can be considered a mod. The focus was instead directed into designing revamped environments, new items and stronger enemies. This presents players with a more challenging campaign, however the goals and progression remain the same. In terms of gameplay features, the game remains almost unchanged. Soon after release, i-Deal Games terminated relations with Strategy First stating \\"...SF fulfilled none of obligation of contract and paid no single cent to i-Deal Games...\\". Consequently, WF5 remains largely unpatched, only minor hotfixes were published. I-Deal Games also stated that buggy version were released by Strategy First. After the falling out with Strategy First, i-Deal Games developed another version of Wildfire, identified as \\"version 6\\", with Zuxxez Entertainment (now TopWare Interactive AG) as distributor. WF6 contains changed source code, a tweaked graphics engine that allows for a higher resolution, introduces new mercenaries and increases squad size from 6 to 10. It can be patched up to version 6.04 (for English version), up to 6.06 (for German version), or up to 6.08 (for Russian version). WF5 can not be upgraded to WF6 and patches for WF6 can not be applied. See Digital distribution for further details.  Jagged Alliance Online  gamigo AG and bitComposer Games announced at Gamescom 2010 that a new title, Jagged Alliance Online, a web browser tactical MMORPG was in development and due for a 2012 release. The MMO offers the usual Jagged Alliance game mechanics, a mix of turn-based combat and real-time action. From a 3D isometric perspective, each player controls and maintains a group of mercenaries and is tasked to use their abilities to complete missions and collect money and build reputation. To succeed, players are required to train and equip their mercenaries with better weapons and tools. Players can also help each other working together to complete battlegrounds and there are also player versus player battles. Players operate from a Headquarters which can be built up and improved upon. From here players can send their mercenaries on over 100 missions around the globe. Although the game is free, there is additional single player content that needs to be purchased, which can be done so online.Jagged Alliance Online overview from Gamigo Jagged Alliance Online was developed by Cliffhanger Productions using Unity and features full 3D graphics. In July 2013 a free-to- download version was made available on the Steam marketplace.[tt_news]=17&cHash;=c56a5f50b5649f1dcc00b577b5d7fe85  Jagged Alliance: Back in Action  On August 20, 2010, bitComposer Games announced Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, a full-scale remake of Jagged Alliance 2. It was originally titled Jagged Alliance: Reloaded.http://www.jaggedalliance.com/en/allgemein-en/kalypso-media-and- bitcomposer-games-announce-jagged-alliance-back-in-action/ The game was demonstrated at GDC 2011 and released on February 9, 2012. The stated goal of the remake was to improve the original game concept as well as the visual weaknesses of the original. The story and content are noticeably different from the original as well, with key strategic elements such as boardable vehicles and training of militia removed. Mercenaries are easier to train and permanently hired for a one-time fee rather than the time-based pay of the original. Conversation trees with NPCs have been replaced with linear \\"talk or stop talking\\" dialogue. Humorous cut-scenes featuring the exploits of the Queen have also been removed. Jagged Alliance: Back in Action features then- modern 3D graphics in an isometric perspective. The user interface was completely redesigned and includes a new detailed tutorial that helps new players to learn how to play the game properly. The new real time \\"Plan & Go\\" system optionally removes the classic Jagged Alliance staple of turn based gameplay. It also initially removed the fog of war, making the tactical element of the game simpler and faster to play as it was unnecessary for the player to prepare for enemy surprise attacks or ambushes with all enemies immediately visible. A fog of war system was added to the game post-release called tactical mode, which requires mercenaries to acquire a line of sight on an enemy for them to become visible.http://boards.jaggedalliance.com/index.php?/topic/1770-patch-113/ The developers estimate that the remake will take players around 70 hours to complete. The critical reception was mixed at best, with armchairempire.com saying \\"Jagged Alliance: Back In Action is, and probably will for many years hence be, the definitive textbook example of how to mess up by the numbers when attempting to \\"relaunch\\" a classic franchise\\". Even Finnish Pelit magazine, in one of the most positive reviews internationally, stated \\"Back in Action is not a bad game, but pales in comparison to its father\\". = Shades of Red = The first Downloadable content pack Shades of Red was released for Jagged Alliance: Back in Action on May 18, 2012.http://www.jaggedalliance.com/en/allgemein-en/jagged-alliance-back-in- action-goes-into-extra-gameplay-time/ = Point Blank = The second Downloadable content pack Point Blank was released for Jagged Alliance: Back in Action on June 14, 2012.http://www.jaggedalliance.com/en/allgemein- en/jagged-alliance-back-in-action-follow-up-dlc/  Jagged Alliance: Crossfire  On June 13, 2012, bitComposer Games and Kalypso announced the first add-on to Jagged Alliance: Back in Action.http://www.jaggedalliance.com/en/allgemein-en/jagged-alliance- crossfire-2/ The standalone add-on, Jagged Alliance: Crossfire adds new mercenaries, new environments and new weapons. The setting of Crossfire takes place shortly after the events of Jagged Alliance 2 at Khaanpa, a small micronation located somewhere in the volatile Asia region. A huge temple has been uncovered and with it a large vein of coltan ore. This triggers a destructive religious conflict funded by the resources which had led to the deaths of many innocent people caught in crossfire, as the leader of the Jenitenn Cult profits from the disaster through humanitarian aid. The United Nations is unwilling to send peacekeepers in a possible chance to fail in peacekeeping efforts and the ambassador of Khaanpa sends AIM to defuse the threat. Upon the death of the leader of the cult, a volcanic eruption occurs near Khaanpa and the UN finally sends in a peacekeeping effort to help rebuild the nation in the wake of the crossfire. It was released on August 24, 2012, on Steam in a downloadable format and elsewhere on September 25, 2012 as a physical product. Jagged Alliance: Crossfire was developed by the Coreplay Studio in Munich. = Jagged Alliance 3D and 3 = Strategy First and Game Factory Interactive announced in June 2004 that Russian developer MiST Land South would develop the next two games in the Jagged Alliance series: Jagged Alliance 3D (JA3D) and Jagged Alliance 3 (JA3). Jagged Alliance 3D was envisioned as \\"JA2 in 3D\\", or basically the same game as Jagged Alliance 2 but using a 3D engine. Jagged Alliance 3 would be the \\"true sequel\\" to JA2, a full-fledged game in the same spirit as JA2, and using the engine developed for JA3D. JA3D would come out quickly, within a year or two of the release of the generally successful Wildfire mod, and be followed by Jagged Alliance 3. SFI choose GFI because GFI had already released Cops 2170, a tactical-strategy game published by SFI in North America. The two companies already had a relationship, and it was felt the JA3D project could be mutually beneficial. From statements made by both Strategy First and Game Factory Interactive, it is apparent that GFI assumed the costs for the development, with SFI providing the intellectual property and the overall vision for the project. This arrangement proved to be very cumbersome, and prone to misunderstandings and confusion. SFI, naturally enough, had very ambitious goals for JA3D while GFI sought to control development costs and time.\\"Jagged Alliance 3D Interview\\" from Absolute Games 1.5 The initial plan was for GFI to use a modified Cops 2170 engine to quickly produce JA3D. However, GFI already had a second strategy game in production, ALFA: Anti-terror, and they made the decision to use this engine for both games. GFI planned to set the game in Africa, which was fine with SFI. However, GFI ran into trouble with the strategic layer for Jagged Alliance. They proposed a mission-based structure for JA3D instead. There would be no free-flowing strategic layer, as in Jagged Alliance and Jagged Alliance 2 where the player made strategic movement decisions, and initiated attacks on a map. Instead, the game would be structured like Jagged Alliance : Deadly Games, with a series of missions, which were essentially combat-only levels. SFI was resistant to the idea, but agreed to it, feeling this would shorten the development time. Besides, JA3D was always intended as a bridge between JA2 and JA3, so it was acceptable that it was not a \\"full game\\". In 2004, initial screenshots of the new engine were released, showing a somewhat primitive 3D engine with familiar Jagged Alliance characters, such as Shadow. In May 2005, the MiST Land South developers announced they would be discarding the turn-based combat system in favor of real-time combat. The turn-based combat had been a hallmark of Jagged Alliance from the very beginning, and it was a major reason why most fans stayed with the game. This announcement was a surprise to Strategy First, and was very quickly vetoed by Richard Therrien, VP product development of SFI. In September 2005, SFI withdrew the rights for Jagged Alliance 3 from GFI, leaving them with the JA3D license only.\\"Strategy First Terminates Their Agreement With Game Factory Interactive For The Development Of Jagged Alliance Games\\" press release A pre- beta version of JA3D was shown at the 2006 E3 convention, and received a generally favorable reception.\\"E3 2006 Jagged Alliance 3D Hands-On Preview\\" from StrategyCore The gameplay appeared to be very similar to Jagged Alliance 2, with updated and improved graphics, as well as a 3D combat engine. On July 20, 2006, Game Factory Interactive announced that MiST Land South was being dissolved, as of August 1, 2006.\\"MiST land ‚Äì South ceases functioning\\" press release In August 2006, SFI withdrew the rights to JA3D as well. GFI claims that the game simply did not fit within SFI's plans. SFI, on the other hand, states that JA3D was in an incomplete state and not ready for the scheduled release date. It was obvious that SFI, having faced years of development without any progress, had finally given up on the project. This left GFI with no rights to use any of the intellectual property of JA3D, including characters and story line. GFI now plans to rework the characters and story to remove Jagged Alliance-specific details, and will publish the game under a different name. In a September 3, 2006 post on its discussion boards, GFI claims that SFI owes it money, but this is denied by SFI without further elaboration. One of the changes GFI plans to make to JA3D is the introduction of a strategic layer. Strategy First intended to produce Jagged Alliance 3 internally, with head developer Thiessen promising a much more open experience than any other Jagged Alliance game. There were expected to be five separate factions to fight in JA3, instead of a single enemy. Characters were said to have their own agendas and allegiances in addition to randomization of various settings of the game upon startup in order to make it less predictable; a character who was allied with the player in one game could be their enemy in the next. Player actions were also said to influence how the characters of the world react to them. In December 2006, Strategy First outsourced Jagged Alliance 3 again. The publisher, along with Russian developers Akella and F3games, were to create the game, setting an approximate release date of late 2008. As of October 2008 the game has been delayed again, and Akella's website was displaying a release date of Q1 2010. This delay was likely due to publishers demand to improve graphics. On December 21, 2009, a German language game site reported that Akella had stopped development on Jagged Alliance 3.\\"Akella Drops Jagged Alliance 3\\" from games.on.net Strategy First has made no statement on the future of the Jagged Alliance series. On March 9, 2010, German outfit bitComposer Games (now bitComposer Entertainment AG) picked up the rights to the PC strategy series, and started \\"preliminary development\\" on the third full game for release in 2011. In August 2015, Nordic Games acquired the rights from bitComposer. ‚ÄúThe decision to acquire Jagged Alliance was an absolute no-brainer for us‚Äù, commented Reinhard Pollice, Business & Product Development Director at Nordic Games, although no immediate announcement has been made regarding their specific plans for the series. = Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge = In November 2007 Game Factory Interactive released Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge.Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge from gfi.sui The game does not have any storyline or characters in common with JA2, as GFI lost the rights to use any of the intellectual property of Strategy First. Still, it is seen as a spiritual successor; the game is structurally similar to Jagged Alliance series and features a mercenary-themed plot, turn-based gameplay, and a familiar game interface. = Jagged Alliance DS = In June 2005, Pocket PC Studios and Strategy First announced a conversion of Jagged Alliance 2 Gold for the Nintendo DS. In May 2009, a Nintendo DS Jagged Alliance game was released, based on the original Jagged Alliance. = Jagged Alliance: Flashback = In April 2013, Full Control, a Denmark-based game studio, launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund Jagged Alliance: Flashback. The Kickstarter campaign was successful on May 23, 2013, resulting in the game being fully funded including its firsts stretch goal. The game was released on October 21, 2014. Upon release Jagged Alliance: Flashback received mostly negative reviews from both critics and players alike and, as a result of poor sales, the developers of Full Control announced that they would no longer be providing support for the game. Full Control went out of business shortly afterwards due to financial difficulties. = Jagged Alliance: Rage = Jagged Alliance: Rage is set 20 years after the first Jagged Alliance (1995). The game is being developed by Cliffhanger Productions and published by HandyGames with a December 6, 2018 release.  Film  In March 2007, Strategy First announced that they had penned a deal for the creation of a film based upon the Jagged Alliance property. The movie license was acquired by Los Angeles- based Union Entertainment.  Board game  In 20 October 2017, Underground Games announced a board game based on the franchise. The game was originally planned for a 2018 release but this was delayed to 2019.  Digital distribution  On July 6, 2006 Jagged Alliance 2 was made available to buy via the Steam distribution service. It is also available via download from Manifesto Games. Jagged Alliance 2 Wildfire (v5) was distributed electronically by StrategyFirst. Jagged Alliance 2 Wildfire (v6) was distributed electronically by Zuxxez Entertainment. Two versions of the same game (Wildfire) exist due to the game's publisher Strategy First, Inc. falling out after a disagreement with the game's developer, I-Deal Games Studios concerning expenses. Version 5 is the version published by SF before this spat and so is more problematic than v6, the version released through Zuxxez and others by the developer since the incident. Jagged Alliance 2: Gold is available via GameTap. Jagged Alliance Classics (which includes Jagged Alliance, Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games, Jagged Alliance 2 and Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business) was developed by Full Control and published by bitComposer Games in GamersGate, DotEmu and the Humble Weekly Sale of bitComposer Games. Jagged Alliance, Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games, Jagged Alliance 2 (distributed by Strategy First), Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire (distributed by Zuxxez Entertainment/TopWare Interactive) and Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business (distributed by Interplay Entertainment) are all available from GOG.com. Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, the DLC Shades of Red and Point Blank and Jagged Alliance: Crossfire are available to buy via the Steam distribution service.

Personal life Born in Tottenham, Middlesex in 1926, Marks was 17 when he married his first wife, Diana Bugsgang. He worked as a stand-up comedian in variety halls towards the end of the music hall era, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, in a duo called Harrison and Stuart. Marks left the act in 1951 to develop his photographic career, taking pictures of music-hall performers and showgirls. The model and actress Pamela Green was performing as a dancer in a 1952 revue called Paris to Piccadilly, a version of the Folies Berg√®re in London. She became Marks' lover and began working with him as a model. Their relationship ended in 1961 and he married his second wife Vivienne Warren in 1964. While he was filming The Naked World of Harrison Marks he began a relationship with Toni Burnett, an actress and model who made a brief appearance in the film. In 1967, the year the film came out, Marks and Burnett had a daughter, Josie Harrison Marks. Marks' and Green's business partnership was dissolved in the same year, and in 1970 Marks was bankrupt. In 1971 he was tried at the Old Bailey for dealing in pornography by post. Marks and Burnett married in September 1973, but they split up around 1978. In 1979 Marks began a relationship with Louise Sinclair, a teenage glamour model. Glamour photography In the 1950s Marks and Pamela Green opened a photographic studio at 4 Gerrard Street, Soho. Marks provided nude photographs for photographic magazines on a freelance basis as well as selling his own stills directly. With the profits from this work, they launched Kamera magazine in 1957. Kamera featured Marks' glamour photography of nude women taken in the small studios or Marks' kitchen. Marks' 1958 publicity materials contained one of the first uses of the word \\"glamour\\" as a euphemism for nude modelling/photography. The magazine was an immediate success and the business expanded to employ around seventeen staff by the early 1960s, selling a number of other magazine titles such as Solo, postcards and calendars, and distributing imported French books and glamour magazines. Photographic exhibitions were held at the Gerrard Street studio. Marks was also the photographic consultant for the film Peeping Tom (1960), which featured Green in a cameo role. In the 1960s Marks moved his studio to Saffron Hill near King's Cross Station and began selling photoshoots to the American magazine Swank. His Kamera and Solo magazines ceased publication in 1968, with occasional single-issue magazines appearing subsequently. In later years he supplied photographs to the \\"men's\\" magazines Men Only and Lilliput, and sold photosets to David Sullivan's magazines Ladybirds and Whitehouse. Films In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films of his models undressing and posing topless, for the 8 mm film market. These were popularly known as \\"glamour home movies\\". His films were available over the counter at camera shops, and also supplied discreetly by mail order from the back pages of his Kamera magazine. One Marks 8mm glamour film was The Window Dresser (1961), in which Pamela Green starred as a cat burglar who hides from the law by posing as a display mannequin in a lingerie shop. Marks appears in the film as the shop's owner; Green performs a striptease in the store's display window. Clips from The Window Dresser were used in a 1964 piece on the glamour film scene in the Rediffusion programme This Week. These clips showed Pamela Green fully unclothed; the ensuing controversy resulted in Green having to defend the film on the BBC Light Programme's Woman's Hour.David McGillivray Doing Rude Things: The History of the British Sex Film 1957‚Äì1981, Sun Tavern Fields Books, 1992 After a judge threw out an obscenity charge against The Window Dresser, Marks continued to make 8 mm glamour films throughout the 1960s. One such film, Witches Brew (1960) features Pamela Green as a witch casting spells; Marks makes a brief appearance as her hunchback assistant. In another, Model Entry (1965), a cat burglar breaks into Marks' studio, strips and leaves him her address. In Danger Girl, a stripping secret agent is put into bondage by a Russian spy; the agent breaks free, ultimately throwing her captor onto a circular saw. Even more macabre is Marks' Perchance to Scream (1967) in which a model is transported to a medieval torture chamber. In this film, Stuart Samuels plays an evil inquisitor who sentences topless women to be whipped and beheaded by a masked executioner. His feature films as a director were Naked - As Nature Intended (1961), The Chimney Sweeps (his only non-sex feature, 1963), The Naked World of Harrison Marks (1967), Pattern of Evil (1967), The Nine Ages of Nakedness (1969) and Come Play With Me (1977), which featured Mary Millington. Pattern of Evil a.k.a. Fornicon, a heavy S&M; film which features scenes of murder and whipping in a torture chamber, was never shown in the UK. Marks implied in several interviews over the years that the film was financed by organised crime.\\"The Naked World of Harrison Marks\\", The Late Show (BBC TV series), Issue 8, 1992\\"Harrison Marks\\", Psychotronic Video, Issue 15 1993 After directing The Nine Ages of Nakedness, Marks endured a particularly turbulent time in the early seventies including bankruptcy (1970), an obscenity trial at the Old Bailey in 1971, and alcoholism. Ironically, a segment of The Nine Ages of Nakedness had ended with Marks' alter-ego \\"The Great Marko\\" being brought up before a crooked Judge (Cardew Robinson) on obscenity charges. Marks made ends meet during this period by continuing to shoot short films for the 8mm market and releasing them via his Maximus Films company. Based at Marks' Farringdon studio, Maximus was run on a \\"film club\\" basis, meaning that clients would have to sign up for membership before purchasing the films, mirroring the way membership-only sex cinemas were run at the time. While his earlier 8mm films largely consisted of nothing more explicit than the models posing topless, late-sixties titles like Apartment 69 and The Amorous Masseur were generally softcore pornography. Marks had been eager to shoot soft porn material ever since the Window Dresser case, much to the disdain of Pamela Green, who dissolved their business partnership in 1967. \\"He was fond of good living and a drink or two, and he wanted to go on to soft porn,\\" Green told Tit-Bits magazine in 1995, adding \\"there was this one film where he was dressed as a dirty old man and he's creeping round Piccadilly Circus, then you see him in bed with this girl\\".David Flint \\"Peeping at Pamela\\", Tit-Bits, 1995 One Maximus short The Ecstasy of Oral Love adopts a pseudo-documentary format, showing a couple frantically licking each other, ending with some relatively graphic oral sex scenes which are inter-cut with ostensibly socially redeeming title cards issuing advice to \\"young married couples\\". In the mid seventies Marks had begun selling explicit photo sets to adult magazine publisher David Sullivan's top-shelf magazines. Evidently Marks had also sold Sullivan the rights to some of his 8mm sex films, as adverts by Kelerfern (a Sullivan mail order company) carried Marks-directed sex shorts like Hole in One, Nymphomania, King Muff and Doctor Sex for sale around this period.Whitehouse magazine, No.27, 197? While the Marks films offered in UK porn magazines throughout the 1970s appear to have been softcore, and their pornographic nature greatly exaggerated by the advertisements (a familiar trait of David Sullivan), from the early 1970s onwards Marks had begun experimenting with hardcore production. He made short films for a British hardcore pornographer known only as \\"Charlie Brown\\", and began making hardcore versions of his own Maximus short films which were released overseas on the Color Climax and Tabu labels. In later years Marks was reluctant to discuss these hardcore short films and claimed \\"not to remember\\" their names. Arabian Knights (also filmed for Color Climax in 1979) was shot at the Hotel Julius Caesar in Queens Gardens in Bayswater and features mainstream actor Milton Reid in a non-sex role. Other works A lover of animals, in particular felines, in the early stages of his career Marks had a sideline photographing cats, and provided the photographs for Compton Mackenzie's book Cats's Company (1960). ‚ÄúHe was an excellent photographer of nudes,\\" producer Tony Tenser remarked to John Hamilton in a 1998 interview, \\"but he also excelled in photographs of cats, that were much more beautiful than some of his nudes\\".John Hamilton \\"Tigon Tales of Terror\\" The Darkside issue 78, 1998 Marks' cats remained a fixture of his studio and can be spotted scurrying about in several of the 8mm glamour films of the period, occasionally even appearing in prominent roles. In the wake of the success of his early \\"glamour\\" films Harrison Marks also produced a series of slapstick comedies also sold via the photographic shops and magazines that were the outlet for his adult work. As well as directing these films he also appeared as one of the main actors. Titles like Uncle's Tea Party, Defective Detectives, High Diddle Fiddle, Dizzy Decorators and Musical Maniacs were founded in the music hall and classic silent comedy traditions. Needless to say, they were less successful than his girlie films and the competition from the real thing (i.e., the Chaplin, Keaton, and Harrold Lloyd classics that he paid homage to), which provided most of the package film releases of the day. =Janus and Kane= In the late 1970s Marks was hired as a photographer for Janus, a fetish magazine specialising in spanking and caning imagery. He also produced and directed short erotic corporal punishment films for Janus for the then- emerging home video market. One of these, Warden's End, starring glamour model and pornographic actress Linzi Drew, shows the exterior and interior of Janus's London storefront office at 40 Old Compton Street. In 1982 Marks left the Janus stable to set up his own fetish magazine Kane which also featured caning and spanking photos. Kane described itself as \\"The CP Journal of Fantasy, Fact and Fiction for Adults.\\" Corporal punishment would now become Marks' big theme for the final act of his career. According to his official website, Marks' corporal punishment material \\"kept him in booze and cigarettes and an acceptable degree of comfort for the rest of his life\\". He created the Kane International Videos division and went on to direct (and sometimes also performed in) a number of full-length corporal punishment videos in the 1980s and 1990s. Some of his videos include: The Spanking Academy of Dr. Blunt, Stinging Tales, Naughty Schoolgirls Revenge, and Spanker's Paradise (parts 1 & 2) in 1992 in which he acted opposite English porn star Vida Garman. After his death in 1997, his daughter Josie Harrison Marks took over the editing of Kane. Biography In 1967 Franklyn Wood, a former art editor of The Times and the first editor in Fleet Street to run a diary (in the Daily Sketch) under his own name, published a biography of Harrison Marks called The Naked Truth About Harrison Marks.

Initially a rebadged locally assembled Plymouth Valiant from the United States, from the second generation launched in 1963, the Valiant was fully manufactured in Australia. It was sold locally but also in New Zealand and South Africa, with smaller numbers also exported to South-East Asia and the United Kingdom. Parent company Chrysler made a substantial investment in Australian manufacturing facilities, by establishing operations in South Australia with an assembly plant at Tonsley Park in 1964New Plant Built in Record Time, The Advertiser, Friday, 2 October 1964, page 26 and an engine foundry at Lonsdale in 1968. The Valiant thus established its position as the third of the \\"Big 3\\" Australian-made vehicles behind the Holden Kingswood and Ford Falcon. The Australian Valiant was built on the North American A-body platform but with many parts and components from Australian suppliers. Apart from a sedan and wagon body style, 1965 saw the introduction of a commercial utility that was badged the Wayfarer and later exported to South Africa as the Rustler. In September 1969 the two-door Hardtop was released and in 1971 the Charger. Greater differentiation from the donor car creeped in over time, particularly since the VE series, which was embraced by the Australian motoring press and won the 1967 Wheels magazine Car of the Year award. The VF series of 1969 and the VG of 1970 departed even further from its North American donor both in terms of styling and performance‚Äîwith the latter series introducing the Hemi-6 engine that replaced the Slant-6. Moreover, Australia continued to produce a station wagon model, called the Safari, even after this body style being discontinued for North America. Beginning in 1971, the VH series saw Chrysler Australia develop the entire lineup locally until the CM series of 1979, which marked the end of local production in 1981, after the takeover of operations by Mitsubishi Motors Australia. First generation =RV1 (R Series)= RV1 Valiant sedan RV1 Valiant sedan After the Plymouth Valiant turned out to be a success in the United States (starting with its 1959 introduction), Chrysler released Australia's first locally assembled Valiant, the RV1 (R-series). It was officially unveiled by South Australia's Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, in January 1962 and was assembled at Chrysler's Mile End facility.Motor Manual, September 1984, page 74 The RV1 (or R Series) Valiant was an instant success. Not everyone was taken instantly by the car's styling, but the general consensus was that the car had a modern, almost space age quality about it. Also notable was the Valiant's performance with from the 225 Slant-6 engine. This was a lot of power compared to the competing Holdens and Fords, which offered only and SAE respectively. Standard transmission in the RV1 was a floor-shifted three-speed manual with a non- synchro first gear. A pushbutton-operated three-speed TorqueFlite automatic was optional.Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, R Series Valiant brochure, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 13 Other options included a heater-demister unit, as well as a \\"Moparmatic\\" deluxe pushbutton transistor radio. The RV1 Valiant was the first Australian car to come with an alternator instead of a generator, and instead of coil springs, the Valiant came with torsion bar suspension. Brakes were hydraulic drums front and rear. The RV1 had a simulated spare wheel outline on the bootlid, but the spare wheel was actually under the floor of the boot. The base model sold for ¬£1299. =SV1 (S Series)= SV1 Valiant sedan SV1 Valiant sedan In March 1962, Chrysler replaced the American 1961-model R Valiant with the American 1962 SV1 (S Series) Valiant. The SV1 used the same body shell as the RV1, with cosmetic changes including the deletion of the simulated spare wheel on the bootlid, and round tail lamps replacing the R-model's cat-eye shaped ones. There was a revised radiator grille and new exterior trim. Mechanical changes included relocation of the manual transmission shifter to the steering column, new ball joints, and a new gear-reduction starter motor. 10,009 SV1 Valiants were sold, of which 5,496 were automatics and 4,513 were manuals. Second generation =AP5 Series= AP5 Valiant Regal sedan AP5 Valiant Regal sedan On 30 May 1963, Chrysler Australia produced the first fully Australian manufactured Valiant, the AP5. In February of that year,New plant built in record time, The Advertiser, Friday, 2 October 1964, p.20. Chrysler Australia had begun work on its new $36 million Tonsley Park facility in South Australia,Australian Motor Manual, October 1966, p.39. where it could boost annual production to 50 thousand cars. The new plant produced its first Valiants on 31 March 1964. The AP5 (\\"AP\\" for Australian ProductionDavis, Tony: The Valiant Book ) was an entirely new design with only the four doors, windscreen, and front guards shared with its North American counterpart. Initial cars retained the left- hand-drive wiper pattern but this was soon changed to a RHD layout. The Slant-6 driveline was retained, but the AP5 was considerably more straightforward in styling than its R- and S-model antecedents. With high local content and specifications optimised for local conditions, this new Valiant strengthened the brand's position in the marketplace. A new upmarket Regal version was included in the range. In November 1963 an AP5 Safari station wagon was released. Total production of the AP5 range amounted to 49,440 vehicles.Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 88 =AP6 Series= AP6 Valiant sedan AP6 Valiant sedan AP6 Valiant Safari Wagon In March 1965, the AP5 was supplanted by the AP6. The body shell was the same, but there was a new grille on the theme of the 1964 North American Plymouth Barracuda, and there was new trim inside and out. The automatic transmission was no longer controlled by pushbuttons, but instead by a conventional shift lever. The AP6 also included other new features such as self-adjusting brakes and acrylic enamel paint, at the time the most advanced auto finish available. The AP6 model range included the Valiant Wayfarer, the first Valiant-based coupe utility to be built by Chrysler Australia. The AP6 was the first Australian- built Valiant to be offered with a V8 engine ‚Äî the LA V8, introduced in American Valiants in 1964, and released in Australia in August 1965. The engine developed and pushed the Valiant to a top speed of . The V8 was only available as a model in its own right, the V8 Valiant, which had a vinyl- covered roof, individual bucket seats, floor console mounted automatic shift lever and two-tone steering wheel. The Slant-6's camshaft was also slightly upgraded for improved torque by dint of increased duration and lift. Chrysler Australia had difficulty meeting demand, with the Valiant being built at Tonsley Park at a maximum rate of 200 cars per eight-hour shift. Customers had to wait up to four months for delivery of a new AP6. Prices ran from $2,500 to $3,650. =VC Series= VC Valiant Regal sedan The VC Valiant was introduced in March 1966 and, although underneath it was basically the same car as the preceding AP6 Series, the body was extensively restyled giving the illusion of being longer and lower. The modern new design was highlighted by sharp, squared-off edges and corners clearly influenced by Chrysler in the United States. The front now had a full-width horizontal grille while the rear was also much squarer with vertical taillights. The range of models again consisted of the Valiant standard or Regal sedan, standard or Safari Regal wagon and Wayfarer utility. They featured higher standard equipment levels as well as new safety features, such as optional disc brakes on V8 models, which were named 'Valiant V8/Safari V8' and were essentially Regal models. The VC Series was built both for its major market, Australia, but also for export to the United Kingdom, as announced at the October 1966 London Motor Show, based on the following range of uniquely named models (brackets indicate the equivalent Australian nameplate): * Medium Saloon (Valiant equivalent) * Medium Safari Estate Car (Valiant Safari wagon equivalent) * Regal Highline Saloon Automatic (Valiant Regal equivalent) * Regal Highline Safari (Valiant Safari Regal wagon equivalent) * Premium V8 Saloon (Valiant V8 equivalent) * Premium Safari Estate Car (Valiant Safari V8 wagon equivalent) In total, Chrysler Australia built 65,634 VC Series models. Third generation =VE Series= Dodge utility, a lower-priced version of the VE Valiant utility This Valiant was an all-new design introduced in October 1967, based on the North American platform, which had a wheelbase. The bonnet and guards were shared with the also-new 1967 North American Dodge Dart, with other styling cues otherwise inherited from the North American Valiant. The car featured slightly larger body dimensions and greater interior space than the preceding VC Series. The roofline was also flattened out and the rear window was given a concave profile. Higher levels of standard equipment were featured and two engine options became available. The basic Slant-6 was retained with its rating, but a new 2-barrel carbureted version was released with output of . The 273 V8 was also improved and made available across the entire Valiant range. Other upgrades included the introduction of a larger fuel tank, shorter gear lever throw on the manual gearbox, relocation of the dipswitch from under the brake pedal to the high left of the firewall, and the windscreen wiper motor was relocated to the engine side of the firewall ‚Äî greatly reducing wiper noise. All models benefited from additional safety features (some compulsory under new Australian Design Rules, or ADRs) such as dual circuit brakes with a tandem master cylinder, double sided safety rims, front seat belts and front power disc brakes on V8 models. The VE range consisted of Valiant & Valiant Regal sedans, Valiant Safari & Valiant Regal Safari station wagons and Valiant, Valiant Wayfarer & Dodge utilities, the latter being a lower-priced version of the Valiant utility. The flagship model followed on from the AP6 and VC V8 theme, being similarly equipped with bucket seats, floor shift automatic, and vinyl roof all standard, but was given the new name \\"VIP\\" to distinguish it from other models, since the V8 engine option was made available across the range. It also shared the 3 'sergeant stripes' of the VC V8 on the rear quarter panel. The biggest accolade for the VE Valiant was Wheels \\"Car of the Year\\" in 1967 ‚Äî the first for Chrysler Australia.Road Test ‚Äì Valiant VE (Wheels Car of the Year 1967) in Wheels magazine 68,688 VE Valiants were built.Valiant VE Technical Specifications Retrieved from www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au on 22 February 2011 =VF Series= VF Valiant Regal 770 hardtop VF Valiant Pacer In March 1969, the VE was replaced by the VF model. The new car shared its middle section with the previous VE Valiant, but there was new front and rear styling. The new front end featured a horizontally convex grille, replacing the VE's concave design. The front indicators were placed at the top leading edge of the front guards rather than in a more conventional location in the grille or front bumper. This allowed the VF's front bumper to be thinner and less prominent, which made the single round headlights look larger, and the front end appeared more aggressive as a result. Valiant and Valiant Regal models were once again available, and the VF range also saw the introduction of the Valiant Regal 770 and an upgraded VIP model. The VF VIP was introduced two months after the Valiant range and was no longer a Valiant V.I.P. but was now marketed as a Chrysler VIP, in sedan form only. It offered a stretched () wheelbase, with longer rear doors than the Valiant. As with previous model changes, the VF boasted even more safety features including a padded instrument panel and energy absorbing steering column. A larger version of the LA V8 replaced the 273, taking the V8's top speed to . Transmission options remained the same: three-speed manual or three-speed TorqueFlite automatic. The most significant introduction to the VF range was the all new two-door Valiant Hardtop ‚Äî essentially, a North American Dodge Dart coup√© with the Australian Valiant front sheetmetal and interior trim. At over , it is the longest coupe ever built in Australia.Chrysler Valiant VF, www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au Retrieved on 17 July 2013 Released six months after the other VF Valiants in September 1969, it was available in Valiant, Valiant Regal and Valiant Regal 770 models. In mid 1969, Chrysler released a fast four-door named Valiant Pacer. A low-cost, high-power version of the bread-and-butter Valiant sedan, the Pacer featured a high-performance six-cylinder engine and three-speed manual gearbox with floor shifter. Despite a lack of exterior chrome, the VF Pacer stood out with its red and black grille, simulated-mag wheel hub caps, special body striping, 'Pacer 225' decals, and choice of \\"Wild Blue\\", \\"Wild Red\\", or \\"Wild Yellow\\" exterior colours. The sparsely trimmed interior featured high back bucket seats, and distinctive black on white instrument dials with a dash-top-mounted tachometer. Although lacking the V8 of its rivals, the Pacer could reach almost and, at $2798, was $400 cheaper than the base GTS Monaro. The Pacer was powered by a special version of the trusty 225 Slant-6. With two-barrel carburettor, high-flow exhaust system, and 9.3:1 compression ratio, it produced . Standard brakes were finned, servo-assisted drum brakes all round, although most buyers opted for the optional front discs. Underneath was Valiant's basic torsion bar suspension, lowered by to improve handling and with a front anti-sway bar fitted. A 'Sure-Grip' limited-slip differential with either 3.23:1 or 2.92:1 ratios was optional. Contemporary road testers were mostly full of praise for the Pacer, noting there were few cars that could match it on a performance for price basis. Modern Motor (May, 1969) took a VF Pacer sedan to in a respectable 10.5 seconds, the in 17.5 seconds and topped out at . In 1969, Chrysler's market share reached 13.7%. In total, 52,944 VF Valiants were built. =VG Series= VG Valiant sedan VG Valiant Regal 770 hardtop VG Valiant Regal Safari station wagon August 1970 saw the introduction of another facelifted version of the VE/VF bodystyle in the VG Valiant. The VG's most noticeable difference was the use of rectangular headlamps instead of the traditional round ones (except on VIP models, which used quad round headlamps). The guard-top indicator location was carried over from the VF. The grille was a horizontal, single-plane item, and the taillamps were revised and wrapped around to the body side. Sedan, Wagon, Ute and Hardtop body styles were offered once again as well as the same luxury levels as before. The biggest announcement to come with the VG Valiant was of the all new Hemi-6 engine, replacing the Slant-6. The new engine was introduced as a unit with quasi-hemispherical combustion chambers. The \\"Hemi\\" name was already legendary in America with Chrysler's use of the Hemi V8, hence Chrysler Australia's marketing leverage for its 6-cylinder offering. The 1-barrel version of the 245 produced and . The sporty Pacer sedan was available again, but whereas the VF Pacer was only offered with the one power output, the new VG Pacer offered 3 different versions of the new 245 Hemi-6 engine, though Chrysler Australia didn't publish any power output figures for the Pacers. The standard Pacer had a 2-barrel carburettor and produced . Option E31 produced and included a two-barrel carburettor, higher-performance camshaft, smaller fan, and windage tray. Option E34 produced and included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, dual-plate clutch, manual choke, modified instrument cluster, torque-limiting engine mount strut, larger radiator, smaller fan, windage tray, premium engine bearings, shot-peened crankshaft and connecting rods, and high-capacity oil pump. Option E35 included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, heavy-duty engine bearings, a dual-plate clutch, torque-limiting engine mount strut, and the ordinary Pacer-spec transmission. The VG series Pacers were also the first and last to be offered in the Hardtop body style, of which three were optioned with the E31 package and three were optioned with E35 package. No VG Pacer Hardtops were available with the E34 option. Due to Chrysler Australia's policy (local content law/government law) of using only locally produced components, and the unavailability of a local four-speed gearbox, the Pacer was offered with only a three-speed floor shift manual transmission. A total of 46,374 VG Valiants were built. Fourth generation =VH Series= VH Valiant station wagon Chrysler released the VH Valiant range in June 1971. The VH was the first fully Australian-designed Valiant and was a major change from the preceding VG range ‚Äî these were larger cars, styled to look even larger than they were. The grille treatment on the new VH range was a direct design descendant from the US Mopars with the central recessed area for grille and headlamps, surrounded by uninterrupted trim on the outer leading edge of the whole assembly. The rectangular headlamps were carried over from the VG model. The model range of the VH Valiant was quite extensive, starting with the new entry-level Valiant Ranger, and progressing to Valiant Ranger XL, Valiant Pacer, Valiant Regal, and Valiant Regal 770. Carried over from the VG range, the basic Hemi-6 245ci engine was standard equipment for Ranger XL and Regal, but a new version offered and was standard equipment for the Regal 770. The Fireball 318 V8 engine was still an option, but only available on the Regal 770 sedan. The basic Ranger sedan featured a new low compression Hemi-6 215ci engine that operated on Standard grade petrol. This engine was not available on the other sedan cars in the VH range. Unlike the VG range, Valiant Pacer was now only available in 4-door sedan form. Apart from vivid paint colours, optional bonnet blackouts and striping, the new Pacer featured a higher performance version of the 265ci engine, with at 4,800 rpm and at 3,000 rpm. The Pacer could run the quarter-mile in 15.9 seconds, get to 100 km/h in 7.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 185 km/h. VH Valiant Pacer In fact, at its release, the VH Valiant Pacer set the record for being the fastest mass- produced four-door sedan with a six-cylinder engine manufactured in Australia, a record which stood for 17 years. The Pacer's days as the VH performance model were numbered, because that same year saw the announcement and introduction of what was to become Chrysler Australia's most recognised new car ‚Äî the Valiant Charger. In total, only 1,647 VH Valiant Pacer sedans were produced. The new Valiant Charger was unlike anything that had come before and it had the Australian motoring press calling it, \\"...the most handsome car Chrysler has ever produced, and probably the best looking car ever produced by an Australian manufacturer\\". A short-wheelbase, fastback coupe with an aggressive wedge-like stance, the Charger's design gave the effect of speed, even when it was standing still. Chrysler's TV campaign for the Charger featured the young adults at whom it was targeted, waving at one as it swept by them and shouting \\"Hey, Charger!\\"\\"Hey Charger\\" 1970s Chrysler car advert One of the more memorable TV ads of the time, it created a clich√© that haunts today's owners. Charger won Wheels magazine's Car of the Year award for 1971 and was widely acclaimed by others in the motoring press, as well as the public. The Valiant Charger came in four model guises, closely mirroring the existing sedan range ‚Äî Charger, Charger XL, Charger 770, and Charger R/T. The first of the serious \\"track pack\\" R/T Chargers had option E38. Despite being hampered by a three-speed gearbox, it still drew favourable comments from Wheels: \\"We achieved a time of 14.8 seconds for the quarter-mile ‚Äî on smoother surfaces the Charger galloped away so easily that a best of 14.5 seconds is within reach\\". Being a three-speed gearbox, these quarter-mile runs took only one gear change. VH Valiant Charger R/T Six Pack coupe The most recognised performance Chargers were the Six Pack cars. The term six pack denoted the triple side-draught Weber 2BBL carburettors with which the 265 Hemi-6 engine ‚Äì in option E37, option E38, and later option E49 ‚Äì produced levels of power unheard of on a naturally aspirated six-cylinder at the time. The triple carburettors also made for a distinctive throaty note when under acceleration. E38 versions of the Charger R/T featured a 265 Hemi-6 which produced while the E37 was the street tune option made available on Charger 770 and Charger R/T. E38 was a race-ready Charger R/T with the additional A84 Track Pack option, which included a fuel tank. There was also an A87 Track Pack option that included all the race track goodies, but for the larger fuel tank. In mid-1972, the E38 option was superseded by the more powerful and greatly refined four-speed transmission E49 option. This drew comments from Wheels such as, \\"The raw quivering power is instantaneously on tap and with a ratio for every conceivable situation the Charger just storms through. It would take a Ferrari Daytona with racing driver Jackie Ickx at the wheel to stay with one\\". All E49s came with a Track Pack, 21 of which featured the huge fuel tank with dual fillers. The E49 six pack engine came with a baffled sump, tuned length headers, special shot-peened crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, rings, cam, valve springs, a twin plate clutch and of course the triple 45 mm dual throat Weber carburetors. Chrysler quoted this engine as producing which, in a car, made for rapid acceleration. The R/T E49 was the ultimate Valiant Charger, and with only 149 built the E49s are still widely considered today as one of the greatest Australian \\"muscle\\" cars ever produced. Road tests of the era recorded quarter-mile times of between 14.1 and 14.5 seconds. 0 to in 14.1 seconds was the norm. This compares to times of 14.6 for the next quickest accelerating Australian muscle car, the Ford XY Falcon GT-HO (Phase III). Although the Six Pack Chargers were the dominant performance players in the VH range, there was another Charger, the , V8 powered E55, that came close. Option E55 was applied to the new Charger 770 SE in August 1972, and this car could reach in 7.2 seconds and complete the quarter-mile in 15.5 seconds ‚Äî all topped off by a top speed of . A batch of several hundred VH Charger 770 318 V8s were exported to Japan along with CH sedans. The Chargers had a CH-like nose with VH sheet metal surrounding the CH four headlights and grille, a combination that NZ assembler Todd Motors would later use to create its unique VJ Valiant Regal 770 sedan. The Japanese cars also had air conditioning, side marker lights and separate white reversing lights as well as mirrors conforming to Japanese market regulations. Overall, Chrysler Australia manufactured 67,800 VH Valiant cars. New Zealand distributor Todd Motors had assembled the Valiant sedan from CKD kits since the AP5, mostly following the Australian range though with fewer variants and engine choices plus local upholstery. For the VH, it was a little more adventurous, launching a unique- to-NZ Ranger XL sedan as the base model with a two-barrel carburetor version of the 245ci Hemi-6 engine, no tail lamp trim surrounds or door window brightwork, unique seats and upholstery, and manual or automatic, column-shift transmission. The Regal 770 had the 265ci Hemi-6, floor-console automatic shifter, round dials with wood trim in place of the strip speedo and its own unique front bucket seats and trim. The 318ci V8 was optional and a vinyl roof was standard but could be deleted to order. Todd's sole locally built Charger model was also to '770' trim with the 265ci Hemi-6 six and three-speed floor shift auto and did not have the bumper overriders standard in Australia. Early runs had one-piece front door glass and hinged opening rear side windows but, due to problems with water leaks and excessive wind noise, this was soon changed to opening front quarterlights and fixed rear side glass. Wagons were imported from Australia, to Australian specification. =CH Series= CH Chrysler hardtop The VH model range also saw the introduction of the new luxury class vehicles, the CH range. The CH was a further longer in the wheelbase than the VH Valiant ‚Äî ‚Äî with a total length of . It featured quad round headlamps and a different rear end treatment, and had quieter suspension and higher equipment levels. The CH (or \\"Chrysler by Chrysler\\", as it is commonly referred to) was a four-door luxury model intended to compete with the Ford Fairlane and Holden's Statesman models in the luxury car market in Australia.Elisabeth Tuckey & Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page104 Also released in October 1971 was a two-door version of the CH which was called the Chrysler Hardtop, and shared the same wheelbase as the four-door Chrysler, along with the front and rear end treatment. =VJ Series= VJ Valiant Regal hardtop May 1973 saw the introduction of the next model in the new All-Australian designed Valiant ‚Äî The VJ. Although essentially a facelifted version of the VH Valiant before it, the VJ's subtle changes made enough of an impact on the buying public to make it the biggest selling Chrysler Valiant model of all, with 90,865 units being sold. Externally the VJ Valiant continued on with the VH series body styles, though the VJ reverted to single 7\\" round headlamps and a new 8-segment grille. VJ sedans also received new horizontal taillights. Although the physical changes were few, many other new features were introduced in the VJ Valiant range, such as electronic ignition, rustproofing and floor-mounted shifters as standard features. Chrysler upgraded equipment levels in July 1974 with front disc brakes, door reflectors, lockable glovebox and retractable seatbelts all as standard features. While the VJ range still offered sedan, wagon, ute, hardtop and coupe variants, the performance-oriented Pacer sedans and Charger R/T coupes were deleted from the new range. However, a variation of the E37 Six Pack engine (now with four-speed manual transmission) was made available, in the form of option E48, with most of the cars bearing this option ending up being base model VJ Charger coupes. Four VJ Charger coupes were built by special order featuring the VH series option E49 engine. The other carry-over performance variant was option E55, with the 340ci V8 engine option officially remaining as restricted to Charger 770 coupe application only. In August 1974, a special run of 500 Sportsman coupes were released, based upon the Charger XL model. They were only available in Vintage Red with white body accents. These cars also had a unique white interior with plaid cloth seats and featured a standard 265 engine with a choice of either manual or automatic transmissions. In New Zealand, Todd Motors was even more adventurous with the VJ. The base Ranger XL and Charger were updated, as in Australia, with similar NZ-only variations as the VH but the VJ Regal 770 was something of a 'parts bin special' and essentially a merger of a VJ Regal with a CH Chrysler. The nose - also used for several hundred VH Chargers built for the Japanese market - combined the CH's four headlamps and grille with VH Valiant sheetmetal (retaining the older, larger, clear park/indicator lamps) while the rest of the body was as per Australian VJ. Inside, new front seats were CH style, with individual chairs forming a bench shape, and a column automatic shifter was now used. Earlier cars had all-vinyl upholstery but cloth was fitted as standard later. New Zealand VJ Regals also had a vinyl roof in black or beige and the panel between the tail lights was also trimmed in vinyl to match - the vinyl trim could be deleted to order. =CJ Series= The Chrysler was given a facelift in May 1973 to become the CJ Series. The two-door hardtop was dropped leaving only the four-door sedan to carry on the fight against its Ford and Statesman luxury competitors. The related Valiant hardtop's production continued. =VK Series= VK Valiant Regal sedan VK Charger 770 coupe In October 1975 the VK Valiant was released with few external changes from the previous VJ model. The Ranger now had an argent version of the VJ Charger grille, the Charger XL had a white version and the Charger 770 also had the argent grille. The VK Valiant Regal featured a \\"grille within a grille\\".Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 137 The Ranger sedan, Regal sedan, and Charger all now shared the same tail-light treatment, using a horizontal layout with four chrome contours to keep air flow away and keep the lenses clean. The Chargers were not called Chrysler Valiant Chargers any longer; with the 'Valiant' name being dropped.Chrysler Valiant VK Retrieved from Unique Cars And Parts on 4/8/2008 The VK Regal also had blinker repeaters housed in small chrome boxes which sat on top of both front guards. Another unusual option was the Fuel Pacer option from the Chrysler US parts bin which detected low engine vacuum ‚Äì as under hard acceleration ‚Äì and illuminated the driver side guardtop blinker repeater to indicate wasteful driving. Inertia-reel seatbelts and slightly different heater controls were introduced on the VK, as well as a combination control stalk for the lights and wipers from the Mitsubishi Galant. The Ranger also got full-length door trims, and carpet was now standard. VK six-cylinder series engines were the same as the VJ's, and the 245 Hemi-6 now featured a two-barrel carburettor like the 265 variant. The V8s were mainly units, though the remained an option across the entire range. It was not very popular as the mid 1970s saw the trend towards smaller cars with smaller motors. While the \\"three on the tree\\" column shift manual gearbox was still available, it was rarely specified (although still popular on Utes) and the three-speed floor change was now gone too. Buyers seeking floor-shift manual could choose the four-speed, which was available on all models but could only be had with a Hemi-6, not with a V8. Late in the VK model run a limited edition Charger called the White Knight Special (option A50) was offered with a factory-fitted front air dam. The changes were mainly cosmetic with running gear being largely stock. There were 200 White Knight Specials made ‚Äì 100 Arctic White and 100 Amarante Red. 120 were automatics and 80 were four-speeds. 20,555 VK Valiants were produced and production ceased in June 1976. This was because ADR 27A for exhaust emission control became effective on 1 July 1976, and all the car manufacturers used that date as the introduction of a new model to comply with the new standard. VK assembly did not begin in New Zealand until nearly a year after Australian launch because a 60% sales tax levied on large engine cars, introduced during the 1973-4 oil crisis, drastically slowed VJ sales. The model range in New Zealand was pared down to Regal and Regal 770 editions. A version of the Regal was manufactured for the South African Police as the SPP package in the late 1970's which featured triple carburetors, an uprated gearbox, uprated differential , and larger disc brakes. Approximately 2000 of this version were built and supplied =CK Series= The Chrysler was given a slight a facelift in October 1975 to become the CK series.Elisabeth Tuckey & Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, pages 145‚Äì149 Production ceased just one year later in October 1976 when the Chrysler was replaced by the Chrysler Regal SE, a prestige version of the CL Series Valiant.Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 147 =CL Series= CL Charger 770 coupe CL Drifter van The CL Series Valiant was introduced in November 1976.Valiant CL Technical Specifications Retrieved on 16 August 2010 Although it used the same bodyshell as the previous VK range, the front and rear ends were restyled. The front end used horizontally arrayed quad round headlamps flanking a central grille. The front guards and bonnet were also reworked accordingly. The new bootlid's curved leading edge flowed down to new taillights that sandwiched a simple centre garnish panel. The bumpers, however, were the same units as had been used on the 1969 VF series Valiants. The Ranger name was dropped; the base model CL was simply called Valiant, and the long-wheelbase \\"Chrysler by Chrysler\\" was replaced by the Regal SE. The CL series Regal was marketed as the Chrysler Regal,\\"Chrysler Regal\\", sales brochure for CL series Chrysler Regal, page 1 in contrast to the Valiant Regal name used from the AP5 series\\"Valiant by Chrysler\\", sales brochure for AP5 series Valiant by Chrysler, Valiant Regal section, pages 4‚Äì5 through to the recently superseded VK Series.\\"Chrysler Valiant Regal\\", sales brochure for VK series Chrysler Valiant Regal, page 1 The CL series was the last to include a Charger model, which ‚Äî like the previous VK model ‚Äî was badged and sold as a Chrysler, not as a Valiant submodel. The CL Charger was generally available in only one trim level, the Charger 770, though a Charger XL was made available to police departments. The CL series also saw the arrival of the panel van variant to compete with similar offerings from rival makers. Interiors carried over largely unchanged from the VK range, though the Regal SE offered luxurious buttoned-leather seating as an option. Base Valiants continued with the previous Ranger style strip speedometer, while the Regal dash featured recessed circular gauges and clock with a woodgrain finish. The Charger 770 dash was similar to that of the Regal, except it was finished in black and had a tachometer instead of a clock. The Hemi-6 and V8 were dropped, and the only engine options were low- and high-compression versions of the Hemi-6 and the V8. The CL's introduction had closely coincided with that of the strict exhaust emission regulations contained in ADR 27A. With the 318 engine, a new emissions control system was introduced: Electronic Lean Burn. Transmission options were 3-speed manual with floor or column shift, four-speed manual with floor shift, and three-speed Torqueflite automatic with floor or column shift. The automatic was standard equipment with the 318 V8, and optional with a 6-cylinder. The 4-speed was optional for six- and eight-cylinder models. The floor-shift auto option was fitted to most Regals and all Regal SE's. In 1978 Chrysler released a limited edition run of 400 special Regal Le Baron models (option A17). The Le Baron was available only in Silver, with red or blue interiors. The 265 Hemi-6 was standard, and the 318 V8 was optional. Valiant and Regal sedans also benefited from the 1978 introduction of Radial Tuned Suspension in response to Holden's having marketed their suspension as particularly suited to radial tyres. RTS improved the car's handling and roadholding significantly, and \\"Modern Motor\\" magazine proclaimed that the Valiant offered a better drive than the Holden. The last special option in the CL range was the $816 Drifter package, available on the Charger. The Drifter package included Impact Orange, Sundance Yellow, Spinnaker White or Harvest Gold body paint, and large side and rear stripes. Drifters in white had additional \\"strobe stripes\\" on the bootlid. Engine options were again the 265 six or 318 V8, but the 4-speed manual was the only transmission option. A Drifter Pack was also offered on the Valiant Panel Van and on the Utility.Tony Davis, Chrysler Valiant : the 1970s : from VH to CM, 1994, pages 14‚Äì15Drifter Pack options Retrieved on 16 August 2010 36,672 CL Valiants ‚Äî including the last-ever Chargers ‚Äî were built. The CL was the last Valiant series assembled in New Zealand ‚Äì by now the Chargers and Ranger were gone and the Regal and the Regal SE, replacing the 770, were the only models. The Regal SE was the first car to be assembled in the country with standard air conditioning. =CM series= CM Valiant GLX sedan The CM was released in November 1978, and was little changed bodywise from the CL model. Only sedan and wagon models were produced. A sports sedan called the GLX (option A16) was released as a replacement for the discontinued Charger and earlier the Pacer. Its features included a Charger grill and dashboard, special cloth trim, Cheviot Hotwire mag wheels and black door frames. It was advertised as the car \\"For People Who Like Their Cars Rare\\", as it was the last of the sports models and the jewel in the CM series. The GLX could be optioned with a Hemi-6 or V8. The computer- controlled Electronic Lean Burn system continued giving favourable fuel economy; when Wheels performed an economy test in 1979, they found the ELB- equipped Valiant used less fuel than a Ford Cortina. A Valiant achieved better than in the Total Oil Economy Run. Production of this car continued after Mitsubishi's takeover of Chrysler's Australian operations. Mitsubishi could build the car profitably even in small numbers due to its high 97% level of local Australian content and amortised tooling. However, the car was still badged as the Chrysler Valiant, not as a Mitsubishi. The profit from the sale of one Valiant was equal to the profit from 3 Mitsubishi Sigmas- by this time the Company's main seller. Valiant production ended in August 1981 with production of the CM reaching 16,005 units out of 565,338 units of all models. Full-sized Chryslers were not marketed again in Australia until the 2005 release of the Chrysler 300C. Motorsport Although the Charger is arguably the best remembered Valiant in Australian motorsport, earlier models achieved class wins at the annual \\"Bathurst 500\\" production car race, something that the Charger never did. A Valiant AP5 won Class D at the 1963 Armstrong 500, a VC Valiant V8 won Class D at the 1966 Gallaher 500 and a VG Valiant Pacer won Class D at the 1970 Hardie-Ferodo 500. Chargers were raced in the Hardie- Ferodo 500 at Bathurst in 1971 and 1972 with factory support. They gained a best placing of third outright and second in class in 1972. Chrysler's policy was to race \\"Australian made\\" product, which meant the race cars ran six- cylinder engines equipped with triple Weber carburettors and 3-speed gearboxes. Even skilled driving and good engineering could not defeat Ford's legendary Falcon GTHO Phase III with its V8. In New Zealand, however, the Chryslers proved to be virtually unbeatable from 1971 to 1979 at the famous B&H; 500-mile (later 1000 km) series at Pukekohe Park Raceway. The most successful drivers were Leo Leonard and Jim Little, who still races his Valiants (mostly pre-65 class).

The eldest son of the Yogyakartan Sultan Hamengkubuwono III, he played an important role in the Java War between 1825 and 1830. After his defeat and capture, he was exiled to Makassar, where he died. His five-year struggle against the Dutch control of Java has become celebrated by Indonesians throughout the years, acting as a source of inspiration for the fighters in the Indonesian National Revolution and nationalism in modern-day Indonesia among others. He is a national hero in Indonesia.  Early life  Diponegoro (c.1830) (Collection Leiden University Library) Diponegoro was born on 11 November 1785 in Yogyakarta, and was the eldest son of Sultan Hamengkubuwono III of Yogyakarta. During his youth at the Yogyakartan court, major occurrences such as the dissolution of the VOC, the British invasion of Java, and subsequent return to Dutch rule took place. During the invasion, the Sultan Hamengkubuwono II, pushed aside in his power on 1810 in favor of Diponegoro's father, used the general disruption to regain control. In 1812 however he was once more removed from the throne and exiled off-Java by the British forces. In this process, Diponegoro acted as an adviser to his father and had apparently provided aid to the British forces to the point where Raffles offered him the Sultan title which he declined, perhaps due to the fact that his father was still reigning. When the sultan died in 1814, Diponegoro was passed over for the succession to the throne in favor of his younger half brother, Hamengkubuwono IV (r. 1814-1821), who was supported by the Dutch despite the late Sultan's urging for Diponegoro to be the next Sultan. Being a devout Muslim, Diponegoro was alarmed by the relaxing of religious observance at his half brother's court in contrast with his own life of seclusion, as well as by the court's pro-Dutch policy. In 1821, famine and plague spread in Java. Hamengkubuwono IV died in 1822 under mysterious circumstances, leaving only an infant son as heir. When the year-old boy was appointed as Sultan Hamengkubuwono V, there was a dispute over his guardianship. Diponegoro was again passed over, though he believed he had been promised the right to succeed his half brother - even though such a succession was illegal under Islamic rules. This series of natural disasters and political upheavals finally erupted into full-scale rebellion.  Fighting against the Dutch  Fighting between Diponegoro's forces and the Dutch colonial forces in Gawok (1900 drawing) Dutch colonial rule was becoming unpopular among local farmers because of tax rises, crop failures and among Javanese nobles because the Dutch colonial authorities deprived them of their right to lease land. Diponogoro was widely believed to be the Ratu Adil, the just ruler predicted in the Pralembang Jayabaya. Mount Merapi's eruption in 1822 and a cholera epidemic in 1824 furthered the view that a cataclysm was imminent, eliciting widespread support for Diponegoro. In the days leading up to the war's outbreak, no action was taken by local Dutch officials although rumors of his upcoming insurrection had been floating about. Prophesies and stories, ranging from visions from the tomb of Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa to his contact with Nyai Roro Kidul, spread across the populace. The beginning of the war saw large losses on the side of the Dutch, due to their lack of coherent strategy and commitment in fighting Diponegoro's guerrilla warfare. Ambushes were set up, and food supplies were denied to the Dutch troops. The Dutch finally committed themselves to controlling the spreading rebellion by increasing the number of troops and sending General De Kock to stop the insurgency. De Kock developed a strategy of fortified camps (benteng) and mobile forces. Heavily fortified and well-defended soldiers occupied key landmarks to limit the movement of Diponegoro's troops while mobile forces tried to find and fight the rebels. From 1829, Diponegoro definitively lost the initiative and he was put in a defensive position; first in Ungaran, then in the palace of the Resident in Semarang, before finally retreating to Batavia. Many troops and leaders were defeated or deserted.  Capture and exile  The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro by Raden Saleh The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro to General De Kock, by Dutch painter Nicolaas Pieneman In 1830 Diponegoro's military was as good as beaten and negotiations were started. Diponegoro demanded to have a free state under a sultan and wanted to become the Muslim leader (caliph) for the whole of Java. In March 1830 he was invited to negotiate under a flag of truce. He accepted and met at the town of Magelang but was taken prisoner on 28 March despite the flag of truce. De Kock claims that he had warned several Javanese nobles to tell Diponegoro he had to lessen his previous demands or that he would be forced to take other measures. Circumstances of Diponegoro's arrest were seen differently by himself and the Dutch. The former saw the arrest as a betrayal due to the flag of truce, while the latter declared that he had surrendered. Imagery of the event, by Javanese Raden Saleh and Dutch Nicolaas Pieneman, depicted Diponegoro differently - the former visualizing him as a defiant victim, the latter as a subjugated man. Immediately after his arrest, he was taken to Semarang and later to Batavia, where he was detained at the basement of what is today the Jakarta History Museum. On 1830, he was taken to Manado, Sulawesi by ship. After several years in Manado, he was moved to Makassar in July 1833 where he was kept within Fort Rotterdam due to the Dutch believing that the prison was not strong enough to contain him. Despite his prisoner status, his wife Ratnaningsih and some of his followers accompanied him into exile and he received high-profile visitors including 16 year old Dutch Prince Henry in 1837. Diponegoro also composed manuscripts on Javanese history and wrote his autobiography, Babad Diponegoro, during his exile. His physical health deteriorated due to old age, and he died on 8 January 1855. Before he died, Diponegoro mandated that he was to be buried in Kampung Melayu, a neighborhood then inhabited by the Chinese and the Dutch. This was followed, with the Dutch donating 1.5 hectares (3¬æ acres) of land for his graveyard which today has shrunk to just 550 square meters (6000 sq. ft.). Later, his wife and followers were also buried in the same complex. His tomb is today visited by pilgrims - often military officers and politicians.  Legacy  rupiah banknote Diponegoro's dynasty would survive to the present day, with their sultans holding secular powers as the governors of Special Region of Yogyakarta. In 1969, a large monument was erected in Tegalrejo, outside Yogyakarta, with sponsorship from the military where Diponegoro's palace was believed to have stood, although at that time there were little to show for such a building. In 1973, under the presidency of Suharto, Diponegoro was made a National Hero of Indonesia. Kodam IV/Diponegoro, Indonesian Army regional command for the Central Java Military Region, is named after him. The Indonesian Navy has named two ships after him. The first of these was the lead ship KRI Diponegoro: a Sigma-class corvette purchased from the Netherlands. Diponegoro University in Semarang was also named after him, along with many major roads in Indonesian cities. Diponegoro is also depicted in Javanese stanzas, wayang and performing arts, including self-authored Babad Diponegoro. The militancy of people's resistance in Java would rise again during the Indonesian Revolution, which saw the country gain independence from the Netherlands. Early Islamist political parties in Indonesia, such as the Masyumi, portrayed Diponegoro's jihad as a part of the Indonesian national struggle and by extension Islam as a prominent player in the formation of the country. During the Royal Netherlands state visit to Indonesia in March 2020, King Willem-Alexander returned the kris of Prince Diponegoro to Indonesia, received by President Joko Widodo. Today considered as Indonesian national hero, Prince Diponegoro of Yogyakarta was the charismatic leader of the mass rebellion against Dutch colonial rule during Java War in 1830. His kris was long considered lost, but has now been found, after being identified by the Dutch National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. The kris of Prince Diponegoro represents a historic importance, as a symbol of Indonesian heroic resilience and the nation's struggle for independence. The extraordinary gold-inlaid Javanese dagger previously was held as the Dutch state collection, and is now part of the collection of the Indonesian National Museum.

It was sold as a captive import by the Jeep-Eagle sales division that was created after Chrysler Corporation purchased American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. Overview The Eagle Summit joined the Dodge Colt and Plymouth Colt starting in 1989 as Chrysler wound down the production of the subcompact Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni twins. The introduction of the Summit coincided with the release of the Mitsubishi Mirage's third generation. The Eagle Summit was the subcompact automobile model in the product mix for Jeep-Eagle dealers. Previously this position was held by the Renault Alliance until Renault withdrew from the U.S. and Canadian markets in 1987. The Eagle Summit line lasted through the extent of the Mirage's fourth generation, which ended in 1996. The somewhat related Eagle Summit Wagon (which was a compact MPV) ran from 1992‚Äì1996 and was based on the Mitsubishi RVR. The Chrysler Neon was introduced in January 1994 and was marketed by Dodge and Plymouth dealers. Chrysler officials declared that no Eagle version of the Neon was planned leaving Eagle dealers with a competitor to the Neon, and combined with the Summit's Mitsubishi heritage made the line expendable. Year-to-year changes =First generation (1989-1992)= The Summit was a badge engineered version of the Mitsubishi Mirage. In a pairing of the Japanese-built Mitsubishi Mirage and the identical Eagle Summit to test if Lee Iacocca's theory was true regarding the preference of a Japanese to an American brand on similar cars, Popular Mechanics found that American consumers were \\"not sold on Japanese cars. Quite the opposite. They want to \\"Buy American,\\" but the Japanese manufacturers seem to offer more of the type of cars Americans need and at a better price, and from more cooperative dealers.\\" Originally assembled in Japan, starting with the 1991 model year, the Eagle Summits were built by Diamond-Star Motors (DSM), a joint-venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi, in Normal, Illinois.Taylor, p. 46. : 1989: Summit was introduced as a sedan in DL and LX trim, both powered by a 1.5-liter 8-valve 4-cylinder engine with . The LX could have a 1.6-liter 16-valve DOHC engine with . The of interior volume classified the Summit into the compact car class, while most of its competitors were still subcompacts. The Summit was also noted for its generous rear legroom. : 1990: A low-cost base model was added to the bottom of the Summit line. Added to the top was a new ES, which paired the 1.6-liter engine with a sport suspension, 4-wheel- disc brakes, and alloy wheels with P195/60R14 tires. All models received all- capital lettering on the back. Hatchback (related Dodge Colt) : 1991: The 1.5-liter engine output increased to due to 4 additional valves (for 12 total). The ES models returned to wheels and disc brakes on only the front. New was the 2-door Summit hatchback; both it and the sedan came in base and ES trims. The manual transmission was a 4-speed on the base hatchback and a 5-speed on all others; the automatic was a 3-speed on hatchbacks and a 4-speed on sedans. All models featured a new front grille. : 1992: The Summit Wagon joined the line, and it was a completely different vehicle featuring a high roofline and sliding rear side door. This \\"crossover\\" design was actually a rebadged Mitsubishi RVR, thus not related to the Mirage-based Summits. The Wagon was available in DL and LX trims, as well as in a four-wheel drive (AWD) version. The new Summit Wagon was marketed as blending the maneuverability of a small car with the roominess of a minivan with its interior offering high seating positions and removable rear seats. It was designed to attract young families with seating for five. =Second generation (1993-1996)= The 1993 model year Summits were completely new and featured more room on the inside as well as weighing less than before. The Summit was now based the fourth generation Mitsubishi Mirage 'CC' chassis platform featuring a mutlilink rear suspension and the body was given a rounder shape. The hatchback body design was dropped in favor of a two-door coupe version, while a four-door sedan joined the Summit lineup. Eagle Summit coupe Eagle Summit Sedan (U.S.) Eagle Summit Wagon The Summit Wagon, a rebadged Mitsubishi RVR was a subcompact minivan, or mini-MPV. : 1993: As with the Mirage and both Colts, the base 1.5-liter engine remained, paired to a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic. New was a 1.8-liter SOHC engine, whose optional automatic was a 4-speed. The Summit came in sedan and coupe body styles, DL and ES trim lines. RVR-based minivan version, marketed as the Summit Wagon, replaced the Canada-only Eagle Vista wagon. : 1994: All Summits featured a driver's side airbag, replacing one of the motorized seatbelts. The lower-end DL sedan was rebadged LX and inherited the 1.8-liter engine, which was now an option for the ES coupe as well. The ES sedan upgraded to larger wheels. : 1995: A passenger's side airbag on all Summits replaced the other motorized seatbelt, and ES models were renamed ESi. More significantly, the 1994 demise of both Colts left the Summit as the only remaining Mirage clone, and the cancellation of the Mirage sedan at the end of 1994 left the Summit as the only four-door offering. : 1996: Summit models entered its last model year with new paint colors and seat fabrics.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Kefalonia, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior It has been the capital and administrative centre of Kefalonia since 1757, following a population shift down from the old capital of Agios Georgios (also known as Kastro) to take advantage of the trading opportunities provided by the sheltered bay upon which Argostoli sits. Argostoli developed into one of the busiest ports in Greece, leading to prosperity and growth. The municipal unit has an area of 157.670 km2. The 2011 census recorded a population of 10,633 in the Argostoli municipal unit. Its largest towns are Argost√≥li (pop. 9,748), Razata (507), Dilin√°ta (496) and Kompothekr√°ta (449). Urban landscape Exhibits at the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli. Gravour of Argostoli, c.1757. Houses of Argostoli. Maistrato beach. To the east of Argostoli, at the end of the bay, beneath the aforementioned Castle of St. George, sits the Koutavos Lagoon, a feeding ground for the Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). Now a nature reserve, the Koutavos Lagoon was once an almost impassable swamp where mosquitoes and malaria were rife. During the period of British occupation of the Ionian Islands, Kefalonia's governor, General Sir Charles James Napier, constructed a wooden bridge across the lagoon. This was done in 1813 by Colonel Charles Philip de Bosset, a Swiss engineer in the employ of the British army. Four years later stone arches were added and, after some 26 years, the entire bridge was rebuilt in stone. In continuous use until 2005, this narrow bridge is now closed to traffic, currently undergoing renovation by the Greek Ministry of Culture. Almost halfway along the De- Bosset Bridge stands a stone column built by the British to celebrate their presence. The coastal road out of Argostoli to the west was known during the Venetian period as the ‚ÄòPiccolo Gyro‚Äô. Along the Piccolo Gyro, in the Vlikha area facing Lixouri, lie the ‚ÄòSwallow Holes‚Äô of Katovothres, a geological phenomenon. Sea water disappears underground and travels under the island, re- emerging around fourteen days later in the Karavomylos area of Sami, having passed through the nearby, underground Melissani lake. The power of this sea water was harnessed, in 1835, to power a water mill. Further along the Piccolo Gyro is the Agion Theodoron lighthouse, named after the small adjacent church. More commonly known as the Fanari lighthouse, this too was built during the British occupation, in 1829. The original building was destroyed in the earthquake of 1953, the recently restored present structure was rebuilt, complete with Doric-style columns, from the original plans. Buildings that weren't shattered by German bombing in 1943 were destroyed in 1953 by the earthquake that razed virtually all of Kefalonia, apart from the Fiskardo area, to the ground. Opposite the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli are the law courts, originally constructed by the British with stone from the Cyclopean site at nearby Krani. Along Lithostroto, next to the Catholic Church, is a tiny museum (open some mornings and most evenings) dedicated to the soldiers of the Acqui Division. A little further along is the Bell Tower, rebuilt in 1985 to house the original clock mechanism. On the Ionian Sea coast southwest of the town centre is the holiday resort town Lassi, which has several small beaches. Subdivisions Following the ‚ÄúKapodistrias Law‚Äù of 1997, communities around the town united to form a larger municipality of Argostoli, which included the settlements of Spilia, Helmata, Kompothekrata, Lassi, Minies and ten former communities: Agona, Davgata, Dilinata, Zola, Thinia, Kourouklata, Nifi, Troyiannata, Faraklata and Farsa. This municipality, a municipal unit of the municipality of Kefalonia since 2011, was subdivided into the following municipal districts (communities since 2011). Constituent villages are given in brackets: *Agkonas *Argostoli (Argostoli, Kokolata, Kompothekrata, Minia) *Davgata *Dilinata *Faraklata (Faraklata, Drapano, Prokopata, Razata) *Farsa *Thinaia (Kardakata) *Kourouklata *Nyfi *Troianata (Troianata, Demoutsantata, Mitakata) *Zola Transportation Aerial view of the airport. Between the Koutavos Lagoon and the De-Bosset Bridge is the new bus station which connects Argostoli with the other towns and some of the villages on the island, as well as with Athens and Patras. The old bus station, just past these market stalls, is likely to accommodate a proposed seaplane service connecting Argostoli with Patras, due to commence Spring 2006. The main ferry port, connecting Argostoli with the mainland (via Kyllini) and Zakynthos (also known as Zante) is next to this building with the Lixouri ferry (once an hour in winter, twice an hour in summer) docking a little further along. * Car ferry service to Kyllini (mainland) and Zakynthos (Zante) * Car ferry to Lixouri * KTEL Bus service to Athens, via Kyllini, Patras and the Corinth Canal bridge * Infrequent bus service to Poros, Sami, Skala, Fiskardo and various villages en route * Frequent summer service to Lassi, Airport & Ai Chelis, Lourdas, Ammes, Myrtos & Antisamos. * Transit bus service is provided between the Airport and the city of Argostoli (only during summer season).

Each has potential for accidental errors and intentional errors, or fraud. Counts are simplest in parliamentary systems where just one choice is on the ballot, and these are often counted manually. In other political systems where many choices are on the same ballot, counts are often done by computers to give quick results. Tallies done at distant locations must be carried or transmitted accurately to the central election office. Manual counts are usually accurate within one percent. Computers are at least that accurate, except when they have undiscovered bugs, broken sensors scanning the ballots, paper misfeeds, or hacks. Officials keep election computers off the internet to minimize hacking, but the manufacturers are on the internet. They and their annual updates are still subject to hacking, like any computers. Further voting machines are in public locations on election day, and often the night before, so they are vulnerable. Paper ballots and computer files of results are stored until they are tallied, so they need secure storage, which is hard. The election computers themselves are stored for years, and briefly tested before each election. Manual counting Manual counting, also known as hand-counting, requires a physical ballot that represents voter intent. The physical ballots are taken out of ballot boxes and/or envelopes, read and interpreted; then results are tallied.History of Voting Technology from PBS's The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer Manual counting may be used for election audits and recounts in areas where automated counting systems are used. =Methods= One method of manual counting is to sort ballots in piles by candidate, and count the number of ballots in each pile. If there is more than one contest on the same sheet of paper, the sorting and counting are repeated for each contest. This method has been used in Burkina Faso, Russia, Sweden, United States (Minnesota), and Zimbabwe. A variant is to read aloud the choice on each ballot while putting it into its pile, so observers can tally initially, and check by counting the piles. This method has been used in Ghana, Indonesia, and Mozambique. Another approach is for one official to read all the votes on a ballot aloud, to one or more other staff, who tally the counts for each candidate. The reader and talliers read and tally all contests, before going on to the next ballot. A variant of all approaches is to scan all the ballots and release a file of the images, so anyone can count them. Parties and citizens can count these images by hand or by software. The file gives them evidence to resolve discrepancies. The fact that different parties and citizens count with independent systems protects against errors from bugs and hacks. A checksum for the file identifies true copies. Election machines which scan ballots typically create such image files automatically, though those images can be hacked or be subject to bugs if the election machine is hacked or has bugs. Independent scanners can also create image files. Copies of ballots are known to be available for release in Alabama, Arizona, Humboldt County CA, Michigan, New York State, and Dane County Wisconsin. The press obtained copies of many ballots in the 2000 Presidential election in Florida to recount after the Supreme Court halted official recounts. Different methods resulted in different winners. =Timing of manual counts= The tallying may be done at night at the end of the last day of voting, as in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and Spain, and Section 14 of the law: or the next day, or 1‚Äì2 weeks later in the US, after provisional ballots have been adjudicated.\\"Starting to audit only when all the audit units have already been counted is the most straightforward method.\\" If counting is not done immediately, or if courts accept challenges which can require re-examination of ballots, the ballots need to be securely stored, which is problematic. =Errors in manual counts= Hand-counting can be boring, so officials lose track, or they fail to read their own tally sheets correctly at the end of the process. Average errors were under 1% in New Hampshire 1946-2002, though one town had errors up to 20%. Errors were 3% to 27% for various candidates in a 2016 Indiana race, because the tally sheet labels misled officials into over-counting groups of 5 tally marks, and officials sometimes omitted absentee ballots or double- counted ballots. Intentional errors are fraud. Close review by observers, if allowed, may detect fraud, and the observers may or may not be believed. If only one person sees each ballot and reads off its choice, there is no check on that person's mistakes. In the US only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia give anyone but officials a legal right to see ballot marks during hand counting. If fraud is detected and proven, penalties may be light or delayed. US prosecution policy since the 1980s has been to let fraudulent winners take office and keep office, usually for years, until convicted, and to impose sentencing level 8-14, which earns less than two years of prison. =Cost of manual counts= Counting took 86 seconds of staff time per vote ($0.36) when Washington State, USA, hand-counted one contest for governor in 2004 on 2,159,831 paper ballots, with a separate sheet of paper for each voter. The work was done in teams of two, one person reading, the second person recording, 43 seconds per vote, including recovery from mistakes, total 86 seconds of staff time. Counting took 43 seconds of staff time per vote ($0.18) when Clark County, Nevada, USA, hand-counted 21 contests in 2004 on 1,359 ballots with all votes marked by machines on continuous paper tapes. Counting took 32 seconds of staff time per vote ($0.15) when 3 counties in Georgia, USA, hand-counted about 40 contests in 2006 on 2,038 ballots with all votes marked by machines on continuous paper tapes; Counties ranged from 20‚Äì36 seconds per vote. Counting took 9.6 seconds of staff time per vote ($0.04) when 2 citizens in Wisconsin tallied electronic images for each candidate in 2015, at 100 images per 4 minutes, so 2.4 seconds per image, times 4 citizens needed to tally 2 competing candidates. This does not include time to set up the system and access the files. Optical scan counting Ballot marking device Scanner marked multiple candidates with black line Some States Check Election Machines' Counts by Hand In an optical scan voting system, or marksense, each voter's choices are marked on one or more pieces of paper, which then go through a scanner. The scanner creates an electronic image of each ballot, interprets it, creates a tally for each candidate, and usually stores the image for later review. The voter may mark the paper directly, usually in a specific location for each candidate. Or the voter may select choices on an electronic screen, which then prints the chosen names, usually with a bar code or QR code summarizing all choices, on a sheet of paper to put in the scanner. This screen and printer is called an electronic ballot marker (EBM) or ballot marking device (BMD), and voters with disabilities can communicate with it by headphones, large buttons, sip and puff, or paddles, if they cannot interact with the screen or paper directly. Typically the ballot marking device does not store or tally votes. The paper it prints is the official ballot, put into a scanning system which counts the barcodes, or the printed names can be hand-counted, as a check on the machines. Most voters do not look at the paper to ensure it reflects their choices, and when there is a mistake, 93% of voters do not report it to poll workers. Two companies, Hart and Clear Ballot, have scanners which count the printed names, which voters had a chance to check, rather than bar codes and QR codes, which voters are unable to check. =Timing of optical scans= The machines are faster than hand-counting, so are typically used the night after the election, to give quick results. The paper ballots and electronic memories still need to be stored, to check that the images are correct, and to be available for court challenges. =Errors in optical scans= Scanners have a row of photo-sensors which the paper passes by, and they record light and dark pixels from the ballot. A black streak results when a scratch or paper dust causes a sensor to record black continuously. A white streak can result when a sensor fails. In the right place, such lines can indicate a vote for every candidate or no votes for anyone. Some offices blow compressed air over the scanners after every 200 ballots to remove dust. Software can miscount; if it miscounts drastically enough, people notice and check. *In a 2019 election in Northampton county, Pennsylvania, the software under-counted one candidate by 99%, reporting 164 votes, compared to 26,142 found in a subsequent hand-count, which changed the candidate's loss to a win. *In a 2018 New York City election when the air was humid, ballots jammed in the scanner, or multiple ballots went through a scanner at once, hiding all but one. *In a 2016 Maryland election, a comparison of two scanning systems on the same ballots revealed that (a) 1,972 ballot images were incorrectly left out of one system, (b) one system incorrectly ignored many votes for write-in candidates, (c) shadows from paper folds were sometimes interpreted as names written in on the ballot, (d) the scanner sometimes pulled two ballots at once, scanning only the top one, (e) the ballot printers sometimes left off certain candidates, (f) voters often put a check or X instead of filling in an oval, which software has to adapt to, and (g) a scratch or dirt on a scanner sensor put a black line on many ballot images, causing the appearance of voting for more than the allowed number of candidates, so those votes were incorrectly ignored. *In a 2014 Stoughton, Wisconsin, election, all voters' choices on a referendum were ignored, because the scanner was programmed to look in the wrong spot on the ballot. *In a 2010 New York election, 20,000 votes for governor and 30,000-40,000 votes for other offices were ignored, because the scanners overheated and disqualified the ballots by reading multiple votes in races where voters had properly only voted once. *In a 2004 Yakima, Washington, election 24 voters' choices on 4 races were ignored by a faulty scanner which created a white streak down the ballot. *In a 2004 Medford, Wisconsin, election, all 600 voters who voted a straight party ticket had all their votes ignored, because the manufacturer forgot to program the machines for a partisan election. Election officials did not notice any problem. The consultant who found the lost 600 voters also reported a Michigan precinct with zero votes, since staff put ballots in the scanner upside down, *In a 2000 Bernalillo County (Albuquerque area), New Mexico, election, a programming error meant that straight-party votes on paper ballots were not counted for the individual candidates. The number of ballots was thus much larger than the number of votes in each contest. The software was fixed, and the ballots were re-scanned to get correct counts. *Researchers find security flaws in all election computers, which let voters, staff members or outsiders disrupt or change results, often without detection. When a ballot marking device prints a bar code or QR code along with candidate names, the candidates are represented in the bar code or QR code as numbers, and the scanner counts those codes, not the names. If a bug or hack makes the numbering system in the ballot marking device not aligned with the numbering system in the scanner, votes will be tallied for the wrong candidates. This numbering mismatch has appeared with direct recording electronic machines (below). Some US states check a small number of places by hand-counting or use of machines independent of the original election machines. =Recreated ballots= Recreated ballots are paper\\"observers from both political parties there... ballots have to be recreated in every election for a number of reasons, ranging from damaged mail-in ballots, to early voters who use pencils which can‚Äôt be read by ballot tabulators.\\" or electronic\\"With the new digital procedure, staff will be able to fix whatever race couldn‚Äôt be counted, instead of duplicating a voter‚Äôs entire ballot.\\" ballots created by election staff when originals cannot be counted for some reason. They usually apply to optical scan elections, not hand-counting. Reasons include tears, water damage and folds which prevent feeding through scanners. Reasons also include voters selecting candidates by circling them or other marks, when machines are only programmed to tally specific marks in front of the candidate's name. As many as 8% of ballots in an election may be recreated. Recreated ballots are sometimes called \\"reconstructed ballots.\\" The term \\"duplicate ballot\\" sometimes refers to these recreated ballots, and sometimes to extra ballots erroneously given to or received from a voter. Because of its potential for fraud, recreation of ballots is usually done by teams of two people working togetherDuplicate ballot procedures in Ventura County, CA https://recorder.countyofventura.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BALLOT- DUPLICATION-PROCESS-FACTS-2-Final-1.pdf or closely observed by bipartisan teams. The security of a team process can be undermined by having one person read to the other, so only one looks at the original votes and one looks at the recreated votes, or by having the team members appointed by a single official.Duplicate ballot procedures in Michigan https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/XII_Precinct_Canvass_- _Closing_the_Polls_266013_7.pdf When auditing an election, audits need to be done with the original ballots, not the recreated ones. =Cost of scanning systems= If most voters mark their own paper ballots and one marking device is available at each polling place for voters with disabilities, Georgia's total cost of machines and maintenance for 10 years, starting 2020, has been estimated at $12 per voter ($84 million total). Pre-printed ballots for voters to mark would cost $4 to $20 per voter ($113 million to $224 million total machines, maintenance and printing). The low estimate includes $0.40 to print each ballot, and more than enough ballots for historic turnout levels. the high estimate includes $0.55 to print each ballot, and enough ballots for every registered voter, including three ballots (of different parties) for each registered voter in primary elections with historically low turnout. The estimate is $29 per voter ($203 million total) if all voters use ballot marking devices, including $0.10 per ballot for paper. The capital cost of machines in 2019 in Pennsylvania is $11 per voter if most voters mark their own paper ballots and a marking device is available at each polling place for voters with disabilities, compared to $23 per voter if all voters use ballot marking devices. This cost does not include printing ballots. New York has an undated comparison of capital costs and a system where all voters use ballot marking devices costing over twice as much as a system where most do not. The authors say extra machine maintenance would exacerbate that difference, and printing cost would be comparable in both approaches. Their assumption of equal printing costs differs from the Georgia estimates of $0.40 or $0.50 to print a ballot in advance, and $0.10 to print it in a ballot marking device. Direct-recording electronic counting Roll of paper from direct-recording machine, with votes from numerous voters, Martinsburg, West Virginia, 2018 A touch screen displays choices to the voter, who selects choices, and can change her mind as often as needed, before casting the vote. Staff initialize each voter once on the machine, to avoid repeat voting. Voting data and ballot images are recorded in memory components, and can be copied out at the end of the election. The system may also provide a means for communicating with a central location for reporting results and receiving updates,2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines from the US Election Assistance Commission which is an access point for hacks and bugs to arrive. Some of these machines also print names of chosen candidates on paper for the voter to verify. These names on paper can be used for election audits and recounts if needed. The tally of the voting data is stored in a removable memory component and in bar codes on the paper tape. The paper tape is called a Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT). The VVPATs can be counted at 20‚Äì43 seconds of staff time per vote (not per ballot). For machines without VVPAT, there is no record of individual votes to check. =Errors in direct-recording electronic voting= This approach can have software errors. It does not include scanners, so there are no scanner errors. When there is no paper record, it is hard to notice or research most errors. *The only forensic examination which has been done of direct-recording software files was in Georgia in 2020, and found that one or more unauthorized intruders had entered the files and erased records of what it did to them. In 2014-2017 an intruder had control of the state computer in Georgia which programmed vote-counting machines for all counties. The same computer also held voter registration records. The intrusion exposed all election files in Georgia since then to compromise and malware. Public disclosure came in 2020 from a court case. Georgia did not have paper ballots to measure the amount of error in electronic tallies. The FBI studied that computer in 2017, and did not report the intrusion. *A 2018 study of direct- recording voting machines (iVotronic) without VVPAT in South Carolina found that every election from 2010-2018 had some memory cards fail. The investigator also found that lists of candidates were different in the central and precinct machines, so 420 votes which were properly cast in the precinct were erroneously added to a different contest in the central official tally, and unknown numbers were added to other contests in the central official tallies. The investigator found the same had happened in 2010. There were also votes lost by garbled transmissions, which the state election commission saw but did not report as an issue. 49 machines reported that their three internal memory counts disagreed, an average of 240 errors per machine, but the machines stayed in use, and the state evaluation did not report the issue, and there were other error codes and time stamp errors. *In a 2017 York County, Pennsylvania, election, a programming error in a county's machines without VVPAT let voters vote more than once for the same candidate. Some candidates had filed as both Democrat and Republican, so they were listed twice in races where voters could select up to three candidates, so voters could select both instances of the same name. They recounted the DRE machines' electronic records of votes and found 2,904 pairs of double votes. *In a 2011 Fairfield Township, New Jersey, election a programming error in a machine without a VVPAT gave two candidates low counts. They collected more affidavits by voters who voted for them than the computer tally gave them, so a judge ordered a new election which they won. *A 2007 study for the Ohio Secretary of State reported on election software from ES&S;, Premier and Hart. Besides the problems it found, it noted that all \\"election systems rely heavily on third party software that implement interfaces to the operating systems, local databases, and devices such as optical scanners... the construction and features of this software is unknown, and may contain undisclosed vulnerabilities such trojan horses or other malware.\\" *Researchers find security flaws in all election computers, which let voters, staff members or outsiders disrupt or change results, often without detection. Mechanical counting Mechanical voting machines have voters selecting switches (levers), pushing plastic chips through holes, or pushing mechanical buttons which increment a mechanical counter (sometimes called the odometer) for the appropriate candidate. There is no record of individual votes to check. =Errors in mechanical counting= Tampering with the gears or initial settings can change counts, or gears can stick when a small object is caught in them, so they fail to count some votes. When not maintained well the counters can stick and stop counting additional votes; staff may or may not choose to fix the problem. Also, election staff can read the final results wrong off the back of the machine. General issues =Interpretation, in any counting method= Sorting vote by mail envelopes, San Jose, Santa Clara County, California, 2018 Election officials or optical scanners decide if a ballot is valid before tallying it. Reasons why it might not be valid include: more choices selected than allowed; incorrect voter signature or details on ballots received by mail, if allowed; lack of poll worker signatures, if required; forged ballot (wrong paper, printing or security features); stray marks which could identify who cast the ballot (to earn payments); and blank ballots, though these may be counted separately as abstentions. For paper ballots officials decide if the voter's intent is clear, since voters may mark lightly, or circle their choice, instead of marking as instructed. The ballot may be visible to observers to ensure agreement, by webcam or passing around a table, or the process may be private. In the US only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia give anyone but officials a legal right to see ballot marks during hand counting. For optical scans, the software has rules to interpret voter intent, based on the darkness of marks. Software may ignore circles around a candidate name, and paper dust or broken sensors can cause marks to appear or disappear, not where the voter intended. Officials also check if the number of voters checked in at the polling place matches the number of ballots voted, and that the votes plus remaining unused ballots matches the number of ballots sent to the polling place. If not, they look for the extra ballots, and may report discrepancies. =Secure storage to enable counts in future= Australia-Senate-ballots-sealed Australia-ballots-sealed Australia-ballots-sealed If ballots or other paper or electronic records of an election may be needed for counting or court review after a period of time, they need to be stored securely. Election storage often uses tamper-evident seals, although seals can typically be removed and reapplied without damage, especially in the first 48 hours. Photos taken when the seal is applied can be compared to photos taken when the seal is opened. Detecting subtle tampering requires substantial training. Election officials usually take too little time to examine seals, and observers are too far away to check seal numbers, though they could compare old and new photos projected on a screen. If seal numbers and photos are kept for later comparison, these numbers and photos need their own secure storage. Seals can also be forged. Seals and locks can be cut so observers cannot trust the storage. If the storage is breached, election results cannot be checked and corrected. Experienced testers can usually bypass all physical security systems. LocksThere are several sources on lock vulnerabilities: *Lockpicking is widely taught and practiced: *Different techniques apply to electronic locks: *More on electronic locks: *There are no statistics on how often criminals enter rooms undetected, but law enforcement often does so, so ability to enter rooms undetected is widespread: and camerasSecurity camera flaws have been covered extensively:  * are vulnerable before and after delivery. Guards can be bribed or blackmailed. Insider threats and the difficulty of following all security procedures are usually under-appreciated, and most organizations do not want to learn their vulnerabilities. Security recommendations include preventing access by anyone alone, which would typically require two hard-to-pick locks, and having keys held by independent officials if such officials exist in the jurisdiction; having storage risks identified by people other than those who design or manage the system; and using background checks on staff. No US state has adequate laws on physical security of the ballots. Starting the tally soon after voting ends makes it feasible for independent parties to guard storage sites.Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) policy calls for independent foreign officials to sleep with ballots, and allows parties to do so: Turkish opposition sleeping with balllots: Republicans guarded warehouse of voted ballots in 2000 in Florida and had state police lock up ballots in New Mexico: =Secure transport and internet= The ballots can be carried securely to a central station for central tallying, or they can be tallied at each polling place, manually or by machine, and the results sent securely to the central elections office. Transport is often accompanied by representatives of different parties to ensure honest delivery. Colorado transmits voting records by internet from counties to the Secretary of State, with hash values also sent by internet to try to identify accurate transmissions. Postal voting is common worldwide, though France stopped it in the 1970s because of concerns about ballot security. Voters who receive a ballot at home may also hand-deliver it or have someone else to deliver it. The voter may be forced or paid to vote a certain way, or ballots may be changed or lost during the delivery process, or delayed so they arrive too late to be counted or for signature mis-matches to be resolved. Postal voting lowered turnout in California by 3%. It raised turnout in Oregon only in Presidential election years by 4%, turning occasional voters into regular voters, without bringing in new voters. Election offices do not mail to people who have not voted recently, and letter carriers do not deliver to recent movers they do not know, omitting mobile populations. Some jurisdictions let ballots be sent to the election office by email, fax, internet or app. Email and fax are highly insecure. Internet so far has also been insecure, including in Switzerland, Australia, and Estonia. Apps try to verify the correct voter is using the app by name, date of birth and signature, which are widely available for most voters, so can be faked; or by name, ID and video selfie, which can be faked by loading a pre-recorded video. Apps have been particularly criticized for operating on insecure phones, and pretending to more security during transmission than they have.

On the white piano keys, it is the scale that starts with B. Its ascending form consists of the key note, a half step, two whole steps, a further half step, and three more whole steps. :: { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 c4^\\\\markup { C Locrian mode } des es f ges aes bes c2 } } History Locrian is the word used to describe the inhabitants of the ancient Greek regions of Locris. Although the term occurs in several classical authors on music theory, including Cleonides (as an octave species) and Athenaeus (as an obsolete harmonia), there is no warrant for the modern usage of Locrian as equivalent to Glarean's Hyperaeolian mode, in either classical, Renaissance, or later phases of modal theory through the 18th century, or modern scholarship on ancient Greek musical theory and practice.Harold S. Powers, \\"Locrian\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001); David Hiley, \\"Mode\\", The Oxford Companion to Music, edited by Alison Latham (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2002) OCLC 59376677. The name first came to be applied to modal chant theory after the 18th century,Harold S. Powers, \\"Locrian\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001) when it was used to describe the mode newly-numbered as mode 11, with final on B, ambitus from that note to the octave above, and with semitones therefore between the first and second, and fourth and fifth degrees. Its reciting tone (or tenor) is G, its mediant D, and it has two participants: E and F.W[illiam] S[myth] Rockstro, \\"Locrian Mode\\", A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (A.D. 1450‚Äì1880), by Eminent Writers, English and Foreign, vol. 2, edited by George Grove, D. C. L. (London: Macmillan and Co., 1880): 158. The final, as its name implies, is the tone on which the chant eventually settles, and corresponds to the tonic in tonal music. The reciting tone is the tone around which the melody principally centres,Charlotte Smith, A Manual of Sixteenth-Century Contrapuntal Style (Newark: University of Delaware Press; London: Associated University Presses, 1989): 14. . the mediant is named from its position between the final and reciting tone, and the participant is an auxiliary note, generally adjacent to the mediant in authentic modes and, in the plagal forms, coincident with the reciting tone of the corresponding authentic mode.W[illiam] S[myth] Rockstro \\"Modes, the Ecclesiastical\\", A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (A.D. 1450‚Äì1880), by Eminent Writers, English and Foreign, vol. 2, edited by George Grove, D. C. L., 340‚Äì43 (London: Macmillan and Co., 1880): 342. Modern Locrian In modern practice, the Locrian may be considered to be a minor scale with the second and fifth scale degrees lowered a semitone. The Locrian mode may also be considered to be a scale beginning on the seventh scale degree of any Ionian, or major scale. The Locrian mode has the formula: :1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Its tonic chord is a diminished triad (Bdim in the Locrian mode of the diatonic scale corresponding to C major). This mode's diminished fifth and the Lydian mode's augmented fourth are the only modes to have a tritone above the tonic. Overview The Locrian mode is the only modern diatonic mode in which the tonic triad is a diminished chord, which is considered dissonant. This is because the interval between the root and fifth of the chord is a diminished fifth. For example, the tonic triad of B Locrian is made from the notes B, D, F. The root is B and the fifth is F. The diminished-fifth interval between them is the cause for the chord's dissonance. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 b4^\\\\markup { B Locrian mode } c d e f g a b2 } } The name \\"Locrian\\" is borrowed from music theory of ancient Greece. However, what is now called the Locrian mode was what the Greeks called the Diatonic Mixolydian tonos. The Greeks used the term \\"Locrian\\" as an alternative name for their \\"Hypodorian\\", or \\"Common\\" tonos, with a scale running from mese to nete hyperbolaion, which in its diatonic genus corresponds to the modern Aeolian mode.Thomas J. Mathiesen, \\"Greece, ¬ß1: Ancient; 6: Music Theory\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). In his reform of modal theory in the Dodecachordon (1547), Heinrich Glarean named this division of the octave \\"Hyperaeolian\\" and printed some musical examples (a three-part polyphonic example specially commissioned from his friend Sixtus Dietrich, and the Christe from a mass by Pierre de La Rue), though he did not accept Hyperaeolian as one of his twelve modes.Harold S. Powers, \\"Hyperaeolian\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell. London: Macmillan, 2001. The usage of the term \\"Locrian\\" as equivalent to Glarean's Hyperaeolian or the ancient Greek (diatonic) Mixolydian, however, has no authority before the 19th century.Harold S. Powers, \\"Locrian\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). Usage There are brief passages in works by Sergei Rachmaninov (Prelude in B minor, op. 32, no. 10), Paul Hindemith (Ludus Tonalis), and Jean Sibelius (Symphony No. 4 in A minor, op. 63) that have been, or may be, regarded as in the Locrian mode.Vincent Persichetti, Twentieth Century Harmony (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1961): 42. Claude Debussy's Jeux has three extended passages in the Locrian mode.Eduardo Lar√≠n, \\"'Waves' in Debussy's Jeux\\", Ex Tempore 12, no. 2 (Spring/Summer 2005). The theme of the second movement (\\"Turandot Scherzo\\") of Hindemith's Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber (1943) alternates sections in Mixolydian and Locrian modes, ending in Locrian.Gene Anderson, \\"The Triumph of Timelessness over Time in Hindemith's 'Turandot Scherzo' from Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\\", College Music Symposium 36 (1996): 1‚Äì15.

The current tell (ruin) by that name has been identified with the biblical Azekah, dating back to the Canaanite period. Today, the site lies on the purlieu of Britannia Park.Tel Azeka and Google Map According to Epiphanius of Salamis, the name meant \\"white\\" in the Canaanite tongue.Epiphanius (1935), s.v. Concerning Names of Places, section no. 64. The tell is pear shaped with the tip pointing northward. Due to its location in the Elah Valley it functioned as one of the main Judahite border cities, sitting on the boundary between the lower and higher Shephelah.Gadot, et al. (2012), pp. 196‚Äì206 Although listed in Joshua 15:35 as being a city in the plain, it is actually partly in the hill country, partly in the plain. Biblical history Lookout with biblical verses In the Bible, it is said to be one of the places where the Amorite kings were defeated by Joshua, and one of the places their army was destroyed by a hailstorm (). It was given to the tribe of Judah ().Amit (n.d.), pp. 333‚Äì334 In the time of Saul, the Philistines massed their forces between Sokho and Azekah, putting forth Goliath as their champion (). Rehoboam fortified the town in his reign, along with Lachish and other strategic sites (). In a clay tablet inscribed in Assyrian script Azekah is mentioned as being a fortified town, during the time of Sennacherib's military excursion in the country. Lachish and Azekah were the last two towns to fall to the Babylonians before the overthrow of Jerusalem itself (). It was one of the places re-occupied by the people on the return from the Captivity (). Identification Although the hill is now widely known as the Tel (ruin) of Azekah, in the early 19th- century the hilltop ruin was known locally by the name of Tell Zakariyeh.Zenger (2008), p. 721 J.

Azekah) Schwartz's view was supported by archaeologist William F. Albright,Albright (1921‚Äì1922), p. 14 and by 1953, the Government Naming Committee in Israel had already decided upon giving the name \\"Tel Azekah\\" to Khirbet Tall Zakariya.Government Naming Committee (1953), p. 638 (\\"Kh. Tall Zakariya = ◊™◊ú ◊¢◊ñ◊ß◊î\\"). In 1838, British-American explorer Edward Robinson passed by the site of Tell Zakariyeh, which stood to the left of the modern village bearing the same name (Az-Zakariyya, which was depopulated in 1948 and later settled by the moshav Zekharia).Robinson (1856), pp. 16, 21 French explorer Victor Gu√©rin thought another \\"Beit Zecharias\\" to be the village mentioned in the Book of I Maccabees (6:32), and which he locates further to the east at a place called Beit Zakaria (Beit Skaria),Gu√©rin (1869), pp. 316‚Äì319. As Josephus puts 70 stadia distance between Beit- Zachariah and Beit-Sur, Gu√©rin writes on page 318 (translated from the French): \\"Seventy stadia is almost thirteen kilometers from that which separates Beit-Zakaria from Beit-Sour (Beth-Tsour). But we know, from many other passages, that we should not ask Josephus for mathematical precision in terms of figures, and the interval he indicates between Beth Zacharias and the citadel of Bethsura (Beth-Tsour) is sufficiently accurate to allow us to conclude that the first of these two points cannot be placed anywhere other than the present village of Beit-Zakaria\\" (End Quote)Josephus, Antiquities (Book xii, chapter ix, verse 4) a view also held by C.R. Conder who thought the site of the battle between Judas Maccabeus and the Grecian army was in none other than the more easterly Beit Skaria.Claude R. Conder (1878), p. 279 C.W.M. van de Velde who visited the site between 1851-1852 held the view that this Tell Zakariya and its adjacent Kefr Zakariya are not the same as Josephus' Beit Zacharia, where Judas Maccabeus engaged the invading Grecian army.van de Velde (1858), p. 116 (note 1) The matter, however, remains disputed. \\"As for Azekah,\\" Gu√©rin writes, \\"it has not yet been found with certainty, this name appearing to have disappeared.\\"Gu√©rin (1869), p. 333. Original French: \\"Quant √† Az√©ca, en h√©breu A‚Äôzekah, elle n‚Äôa pas encore √©t√© retrouv√©e d‚Äôune mani√®re certaine, ce nom paraissant avoir disparu.\\" Scholars believe that the town's old namesake (Azekah) can be seen in its modern-day corruption, \\"az-Zakariyeh\\". In contrast, Conder of the Palestine Exploration Fund had strong reservations about connecting the site Tell Zakariya with the biblical Azekah.Conder (1900), p. 77 In the mosaic layout of the Madaba Map of the 6th century CE (ca. 565 CE), the site is mentioned in conjoined Greek uncials: Œ§Œø[œÄŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒØŒ±] œÑŒøœÖ ŒëŒ≥ŒØŒøœÖ ŒñŒ±œáŒ±œÅŒØŒøœÖ, ŒíŒµŒ∏Œ∂Œ±œáŒ±œÅ[ŒØŒøœÖ] (= [The] site of St. Zacharias, Beth Zachar[ias]).Donner (1995), s.v. Beth Zachar[ias] () Epiphanius of Salamis writes that, in his day, Azekah was already called by the Syriac name ·∏§«ùwarta.Epiphanius (1935), p. 72 (¬ß 64)Notley, et al. (2005), p. 19, note 47, have noted: \\"According to his (Epiphanius') formulation, it would seem that he was of the opinion that Hiwarta, which means 'white' (lavan), is the translation of Azekah. About five kilometers to the southeast of Tell Zechariah is a high hill called Tell el-Beida, meaning in Arabic 'white'. In current maps, the site is named Tell Livnin, which means the hill of bricks (livanim), and it is to this that Eusebius (who also wrote about Azekah) most probably referred. 'Azekah' is not 'white', either in Hebrew or in Aramaic. Le-azek in Hebrew means to remove stones, and then the soil appears a bit paler. It therefore appears that Epiphanius, who was born in Beit Zedek, near Eleutheropolis, identified Azekah with Tell el-Beida. Azekah is six kilometers from Eleutheropolis, and Tell Livnin is eight kilometers from there. Epiphanius adapted the new name to the identification by means of an etymological exegesis that has no linguistic basis. At any rate, no settlement existed on Tell Azekah in the Roman-Byzantine period. The early site moved from the high hill to the fields in the plain at the foot of the tell. It may possibly have moved as far as Kh. el-Beida, although this is difficult to accept.\\" Modern Israeli archaeologists have noted that, because of the existence of an adjacent ruin now known as Khirbet Qeiyafa, and which is situated opposite Socho, not to mention the site's \\"unusual size and the nature of the fortifications,\\" that there are good grounds to suggest that the site in question may actually point to the biblical Azekah.Garfinkel, et al. (n.d.) Non-Biblical mention Azekah is mentioned in two sources outside of the Bible. A text from the Assyrian king Sennacherib describes Azekah and its destruction during his military campaign. :(3) [‚Ä¶Ashur, my lord, encourage]ed me and against the land of Ju[dah I marched. In] the course of my campaign, the tribute of the kings of Philistia?

Azekah is also mentioned in one of the Lachish letters. Lachish Letter 4 suggests that Azekah was destroyed, as they were no longer visible to the exporter of the letter. Part of the otracon reads: :\\"And inasmuch as my lord sent to me concerning the matter of Bet Harapid, there is no one there. And as for Semakyahu, Semayahu took him and brought him up to the city. And your servant is not sending him there any[more -], but when morning comes round [-]. And may (my lord) be apprised that we are watching for the fire signals of Lachish according to all the signs which my lord has given, because we cannot see Azeqah.\\"Ahituv (2008), p. 70 (s.v. Lachish letters) =Tell Zakariya= Conder and Kitchener, citing Sozomenus (Rel. Pal., p. 753),Sozomen (1855), book ix, chapter 17, covering the years 408‚Äì425 CE mention the non-biblical site of Caphar Zachariah () being in the region of Eleutheropolis, and conclude that this would point to the village Zakariya near Tell Zakariya.Conder & Kitchener (1882), p. 418 Theodosius, archdeacon and pilgrim to the Holy Land, produced a Latin map and itinerary of his travels in Palestine, entitled De Situ Terrae Sanctae ca. 518-530, in which he wrote: \\"De Eleutheropoli usque in locum, ubi iacet sanctus Zacharias, milia VI\\" [= \\"From Beit Gubrin, as far as to the place where lies the holy [prophet], Zechariah, there are 6 milestones\\"].Theodosius (1882), p. 17 Israeli archaeologist Yoram Tsafrir has identified this \\"resting place of the holy Zechariah\\" with the nearby Arab village of the same name, Az-Zakariyya, north of Beit Gubrin.Tsafrir (1986), p. 130 (note 9) Tsafrir notes that Theodosius' location corresponds with the \\"Beth Zechariah\\" inscribed on the Madaba Map, and which site is placed alongside of Saphitha (now Kh. es-Safi). Tsafrir (1986), pp. 138, 141. Tsafrir points out on page 138 that in the Madaba Map is shown \\"the church next to the grave of the prophet Zechariah and near Beth-Zechariah (ŒíŒµŒ∏Œ∂Œ±œáŒ¨œÅ) is portrayed in all its splendor [a writing], standing for loco, ubi requiescit sanctus Zacharias (Fig. 7)\\" [= Lit. \\"The place where rests the holy Zachariah.\\"] J. Gildemeister reasons that one can ask whether it (Kefar Zakariah) is the same place that appears in distorted forms (e.g. Beit Zachariah) in other writings.Theodosius (1882), p. 17 (note 17). Cf. Klein (1915:168) who wrote: \\"The fact that the name ·π¢aidan (◊¶◊ô◊ô◊ì◊ü‚Äé) is not preceded by the word 'Beth' (◊ë◊ô◊™‚Äé) presents no difficulty in explaining the two names as being identical, since similar things are more common among Galilean names (e.g. Maon and Meron; Beth-Maon and Beth-Meron).\\" Similarly, Vilnay (1954:131) wrote concerning the word \\"Beit\\" prefixed to place names: \\"The name Beth-Geres ‚Äì‚Äì Geres, recalls the biblical names: Beth-Nimrah ‚Äì‚Äì Nimrah; Beth-Azmoth ‚Äì‚Äì Azmoth; Beth-Gilgal ‚Äì‚Äì Gilgal; Beth-Lebaoth ‚Äì‚Äì Lebaoth, etc. These two forms of the same name are also found in talmudic literature: Beth-Haifa ‚Äì‚Äì Haifa, Beth-Moron ‚Äì‚Äì Meron, Beth-Maon ‚Äì‚Äì Maon, etc.\\" Romanoff (1935-1936:156 (note 7), writes similarly: \\"The term ◊ë◊ô◊™ [= Beit] was also equivalent to ◊õ◊§◊® [= Kefar]: e.g. Beit Shearim = Kefar Shearim, etc.\\" Most scholars point to the other Khirbet Beit Zakariyyah, towards the east (grid 1617.1190), as the burial place of the said Zachariah, having been found there the ruins of a Byzantine church now turned mosque, and which church is thought to be featured in the Madaba Map. Kh. Tell Zakariya in 1947 Archaeological findings Cave under Tel Azeka. PEF researcher, C.W. Wilson, concluded in 1899 that Tell Zakariya was occupied at an early pre-Israelite period, and that it was probably deserted soon after the Roman occupation.Wilson (1899), pp. 334‚Äì336 The wall which encircles the old ruin shows signs of having been several times rebuilt. In cut and design, the stones appear to have been of Maccabean construction. PEF surveyors, Conder and Kitchener, described the ruin in their magnum opus, the Survey of Western Palestine, saying that they noted on the south-side of the summit an ancient olive-press, among other ruins.Conder & Kitchener (1882), p. 441 Excavations by the English archaeologists Frederick J. Bliss and R. A. Stewart Macalister in the period 1897-1900 at Tel Azekah revealed a fortress, water systems, hideout caves used during Bar Kokhba revolt and other antiquities, such as LMLK seals. The principal areas of excavation were on the summit's southwestern extremity, where were found the foundations of three towers; the southeastern corner of the tell, where the fortress was located and built primarily of hewn stones; and at an experimental pit located in the center of the summit.Amit (n.d.), p. 334 Azekah was one of the first sites excavated in the Holy Land and was excavated under the Palestine Exploration Fund for a period of 17 weeks over the course of three seasons. At the close of their excavation Bliss and Macalister refilled all of their excavation trenches in order to preserve the site. The site is located on the grounds of a Jewish National Fund park, Britannia Park.Archaeological mounds In 2008 and 2010, a survey of the site was conducted by Oded Lipschitz, Yuval Gadot, and Shatil Imanuelov, on behalf of Tel-Aviv University's Institute of Archaeology.Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2008, Survey Permit # G-53; Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2010, Survey Permit # S-159 The Lautenschl√§ger Azekah Expedition, part of the regional Elah Valley Project, commenced in the summer of 2012. It is directed by Prof. Oded Lipschits of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University, together with Dr Yuval Gadot of TAU and with Prof. Manfred Oeming of Heidelberg University. and is a consortium of over a dozen universities from Europe, North America, and Australia. In its first season 300 volunteers worked for six weeks and uncovered walls, installations, and many hundreds of artifacts. As part of the Jewish National Fund park, whenever possible structures will be conserved and displayed to the public. Further reading *E.

It suspended production in 1989 but attained a short-lived renaissance in the early 1990s as a glossy tabloid. Lester Bangs, often cited as \\"America's Greatest Rock Critic\\", became editor in 1971. The term \\"punk rock\\" was coined in May 1971, in Dave Marsh's Looney Tunes CREEM column about Question Mark & the Mysterians. History In the winter of 1969, Barry Kramer owned the Detroit record store Full Circle as well as Mixed Media, a head shop/bookstore and was an unsuccessful concert promoter and band manager. In a fit of pique at the local alternative paper having rejected a concert review he had written, he decided to publish his own paper. Tony Reay, a clerk at the record store, became the first editor, naming the publication after his favorite band, Cream. Charlie Auringer became the photo editor and designer, and Dave Marsh joined soon after at age 19. The first issue was distributed only in Detroit as a tabloid-sized newspaper. A deal was struck with a distributor, but many copies were ordered by porn shops who were confused by the faintly suggestive title, and displayed it next to the similarly sized Screw magazine. Richard \\"Ric\\" Siegel became circulation director and within two years CREEM had become a glossy color magazine, sized for newsstand distribution, and secured a national distribution deal. The original offices were at 3729 Cass Avenue in Detroit for the first two years. An armed robbery of the offices convinced Kramer to move the operation to a 120-acre farm in Walled Lake, Michigan at 13 Mile and Haggerty Road. Just before the move, Lester Bangs was hired, originally to write a feature on Alice Cooper. He had been fired from rival music magazine Rolling Stone by publisher Jann Wenner for \\"disrespecting musicians\\" after a particularly harsh review of the group Canned Heat. Bangs fell in love with Detroit, calling it \\"rock's only hope\\", and remained there for five years. Many of the staff members lived in the Walled Lake farmhouse, where there were occasional physical altercations between writers. Marsh had objected to Bangs' poorly housebroken dog, and placed the dog's dung on Bangs' typewriter. This resulted in a fistfight that gave Marsh a gash on his head. Eventually, the magazine was successful enough to move to editorial offices in downtown Birmingham, Michigan. After becoming editor in 1971, Bangs left the magazine in 1976 and never wrote for it again. On January 29, 1981, Kramer died of an accidental overdose of nitrous oxide, and Bangs died a year later on April 30, 1982 in New York City of an accidental Darvon overdose. This geographical separation from the majority of the entertainment industry in the United States, then focused primarily in Hollywood and New York City, resulted in a certain irreverence, a deprecatory and humorous tone that permeated the magazine. The magazine became famous for its comical photo captions, which poked fun at rock stars, the industry, and even the magazine itself. Every year, the tall Plexiglas pyramid presented as the American Music Award was dubbed \\"The Object From Space\\", and was attributed with the power to force celebrities to look ridiculous while holding it. The location also meant CREEM was among the first national publications with in-depth coverage of many popular Detroit-area artists, such as Bob Seger, Mitch Ryder, Alice Cooper, The MC5, The Stooges, Iggy Pop, and Parliament-Funkadelic, as well as other Midwestern acts such as Raspberries and Cheap Trick. Influence CREEM picked up on punk rock (which many claim the magazine helped to conceptualize, if not invent) and new wave movements early on. CREEM gave massive exposure to artists like Lou Reed, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Blondie, and The New York Dolls years before the mainstream press. In the 1980s, it also led the pack on coverage of such upcoming rock icons as R.E.M., The Replacements, The Smiths, The Go-Go's and The Cure, among numerous others. It was also among the first to sing the praises of metal acts like Mot√∂rhead, Kiss, Judas Priest, and Van Halen. Melvins guitarist Roger \\"Buzz\\" Osborne taught Kurt Cobain about punk by loaning him records and old copies of CREEM. Alice Cooper referenced the magazine in his song \\"Detroit City\\" ‚Äì \\"But the Riff kept a Rockin', the Creem kept a-talkin', and the streets still smokin' today\\". Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth said: \\"Having a certain sense of humor in the rock'n'roll culture ‚Äì CREEM nailed it in a way that nobody else was. It informed a lot of people's sensibilities.\\" Staff Publishers, editors and writers for CREEM included Barry Kramer, his partner (later his wife) Connie Warren Kramer, Lester Bangs, Dave Marsh, Billy Altman, Bob Fleck, John Morthland, Ben Edmonds, Ed Ward, Richard Riegel, Ric Siegel, Robert Christgau, Richard Meltzer, Nick Tosches, Greil Marcus, Jeffrey Morgan, Richard C. Walls, Rob Tyner, Patti Smith, Peter Laughner, Cameron Crowe, Trixie A. Balm (a.k.a. Lauren Agnelli), Craig S. Karpel, Linda Barber, Catherine Gisi, Todd Weinstein, Laura Levine, Judy Adams, Jaan Uhelszki, Penny Valentine, Susan Whitall, John \\"The Mad\\" Peck, Robot A. Hull, Edward Kelleher (aka, Edouard Dauphin), Rick Johnson, Bruce Malamut, Lotta D. Blooz, John Mendelsohn, Jon Young, Lisa Robinson, Vicki Arkoff, Deborah Frost, Cynthia Rose, Mike Gormley, Sylvie Simmons, Gregg Turner, Chuck Eddy, Mark J. Norton, Alan Niester, Robert Duncan, Alan Madlane (as Alan Madeleine), Judy Wieder, Colman Andrews, Jim Esposito, Dave DiMartino, Bill Holdship and John Kordosh. These last three edited the final versions of CREEM in the 1980s. The magazine moved its office to Los Angeles in January 1987. Holdship and Kordosh were both involved in CREEM's move to Los Angeles after it was purchased by Arnold Levitt, but both had already left the magazine before its move to New York City after Levitt licensed the name to a publisher there, and its ultimate demise. Before licensing CREEM to the New Yorkers, Levitt made Judy Wieder editor-in-chief of a heavy metal version of CREEM, called CREEM METAL, which was originally edited by DiMartino, Holdship and Kordosh and which sold well. A young female audience-targeted spinoff, CREEM ROCK-SHOTS, was also published, as were countless special editions throughout the '80s. Former William Morris agent, musician and journalist Mark J. Petracca (aka Dusty Wright) became the editor during its New York residence over 1992‚Äì93. Chris Nadler was the last editor before the magazine was shut down. Steve Peters and David Sprague were the final members remaining in the original editorial chain that reached back to 1969. Graphic design The CREEM logo was designed by Bob Wilson, who also wrote a regular comic strip, \\"Mike and Barney\\". The \\"Mr. Dreamwhip\\" and \\"Boy Howdy\\" icons were designed by underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, reportedly for $50. Both appeared on the cover of the second issue as a black and white drawing titled Detroit 1969. For the December 1971 issue, Wilson colored the drawing, which appeared in every following issue in a Creem's Profiles, a parody of the then- popular Dewar's Profiles, featuring musicians and bands holding cans of \\"Boy Howdy\\" beer. Change of ownership and disputes Ownership of the magazine, trademark and intellectual property has changed hands numerous times since the death of publisher Barry Kramer in 1981, and the magazine's subsequent bankruptcy. Arnold Levitt bought the rights to the magazine in 1986 from Connie Kramer, and added titles including one devoted exclusively to metal along with numerous monthly special editions, before shutting down in 1989. In 1990, he licensed it to a group of Florida investors who published a bimonthly glossy tabloid version, but it was not successful either. The release of writer and director Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical film Almost Famous in 2000, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of editor Lester Bangs, rekindled interest in CREEM and rock journalism of the era. Former CREEM photographer Robert Matheu formed Creem Media in 2001 with his cousin Jason Turner and Michigan businessman Ken Kulpa. They negotiated a five-year licensing deal with Levitt, with the option to purchase the magazine's intellectual property rights for $100,000. They launched a website and generated new content, primarily to maintain the brand. As the five-year deadline of the licensing deal approached, Matheu sought investors, and got a $52,500 investment from Los Angeles disk jockey Chris Carter and Barry Kramer's son J.J. Kramer. Matheu provided the balance of the $100,000. * Carter and Kramer claim that they were verbally promised one-third of Creem Media for their investment by Matheu. * Turner and Kulpa claim they were never consulted about the deal, and never approved it. * Matheu claims he never promised Carter and Kramer such a large share for their investment. In 2007, Kramer sued in New York County and won, as the Court ruled that Creem Media could take no action without the approval of Carter and Kramer. Battle between CREEM Media and T.A. Riggs, Licensing, LLC The litigation between Kramer and Creem Media is over. The internal fighting and litigation kept the magazine in a state of confusion and off the market. Creem Media was sued by T.A. Riggs Licensing LLC in 2010 for breach of contract. Creem Media lost that suit, and Riggs was awarded $575,000.00. Creem Media was either unable or unwilling to pay. In November 2011, Creem Media attempted to have the judgment set aside, but in January 2012, the Court upheld the Judgment. In February 2012, the Court appointed a Receiver to seize all of Creem Media's assets to help satisfy the outstanding judgment. The Receiver has transferred all of the Intellectual Property from Creem Media, Inc to Riggs. CREEM International, Inc purchased the assets from Riggs to become the new successor company with all rights of ownership. Matheu tired of the legal battle and resigned from the board of Creem Media in 2009. As of 2011, Creem Media, Inc. was defunct. In 2017, a group headed by Kramer acquired the CREEM brand and its archives. CREEM Documentary In 2019, the Kramer-led Boy Howdy Productions, in partnership with Muse Production House and New Rose Films, wrapped production on a CREEM documentary entitled CREEM: America's Only Rock 'n' Roll Magazine, which world premiered at SXSW 2019 to rave reviews. In February 2020, the film was acquired by Greenwich Entertainment and subsequently released online through paid virtual cinema streaming rental in August 2020.

Among his translations, Gundissalinus worked on Avicenna's Liber de philosophia prima and De anima, Ibn Gabirol's Fons vitae, and al- Ghazali's Summa theoricae philosophiae, in collaboration with the Jewish philosopher Abraham Ibn Daud and Johannes Hispanus. As a philosopher, Gundissalinus crucially contributed to the Latin assimilation of Arabic philosophy, being the first Latin thinker in receiving and developing doctrines, such as Avicenna's modal ontology or Ibn Gabirol's universal hylomorphism, that would soon be integrated into the thirteenth-century philosophical debate. Life Born presumably in the Iberian Peninsula around 1115‚Äì1125, Gundissalinus received his education in Chartres, supposedly following the teaching of William of Conches and Thierry of Chartres.Fidora, Alexander, 2011, 'Le d√©bat sur la cr√©ation: Guillaume de Conches, ma√Ætre de Dominique Gundisalvi?', in B. Obrist - I. Caiazzo (eds.), Guillaume de Conches: Philosophie et science au XIIe si√®cle, Firenze, 271-288. Since 1148, Gundissalinus is in Castile: the capitular archives of Segovia refer to him as archdeacon of Cu√©llar, a small town not far from Segovia, where he presumably spent around 14 years, regarding which almost no information is available.Villar Garc√≠a, L.M., 1990, Documentaci√≥n medieval de la Catedral de Segovia (1115-1300), Salamanca, 91. Following Ibn Daud's request to the archbishop of Toledo, John II, to start a series of translations into Latin of Avicenna's Kitab al-ShifƒÅ æ, Gundissalinus moved to Toledo in 1161‚Äì1162, where he worked with Ibn Daud on the translation of Avicenna's De anima, realised before 1166.Hernandez, J., 1985, Los Cartularios de Toledo. Catalogo Documental, Madrid, 130.Bertolacci, Amos, 2011, 'A Community of Translators: The Latin Medieval Versions of Avicenna‚Äôs Book of the Cure', in C. J. Mews- J. N. Crossley (eds.), Communities of Learning: Networks and the Shaping of Intellectual Identity in Europe 1100-1500, Turnhout, 37-54 Gundissalinus remained in Toledo for twenty years, collaborating with Abraham Ibn Daud and Johannes Hispanus to the realisation of around twenty translations of Arabic works into Latin. In the Castilian capital, Gundissalinus also wrote his philosophical treatises. The Toledan chapter names Gundissalinus for the last time in 1178 but he presumably remained in Toledo at least until 1181, when a document written in Arabic mentions his name.D'Alverny, Marie-Th√©r√®se, 1989, 'Les traductions √† deux interpr√®tes, d‚Äôarabe en langue vernaculaire et de langue vernaculaire en latin', in G.

Alonso Alonso, Manuel, 1943, 'Notas sobre los traductores toledanos Domingo Gundisalvo y Juan Hispano', al-Andalus 8: 155-188 The last record witnessing Gundissalinus alive is the report of a meeting between the chapters of Segovia and Burgos, held in Segovia in 1190.Villar Garc√≠a, L. M., 1985, Documentaci√≥n medieval de la Catedral de Segovia (1115-1300), Madrid, 135. It is probable that the last years of Gundissalinus's life were spent in that Castilian town, and he died sometime after 1190.

History Falmouth and area was known as Pisiquid by the Acadians. Having migrated from Port Royal (current day Annapolis Royal) (see also Habitation at Port-Royal, an earlier settlement several miles away that predates the French occupation of Annapolis Royal), the Acadians first settled the area in the early 1680s as the 1686 census lists a number of families on well established farms utilizing productive dyked fields. During Queen Anne's War, in response to the French Raid on Deerfield, Massachusetts, in the Raid on Pisiquid (1704), Benjamin Church burned the many villages of the two parishes (Ste. Famille and Notre Dame de l'Assumption) that made up the district to the ground and took prisoners to Boston. One of these prisoners was Acadian leader Noel Doiron. As with the other Acadian districts of the Bay of Fundy region the Acadians of Piziquid were deported in the fall of 1755 (see Expulsion of the Acadians). By 1760 the land left vacant by the deportation of the Acadians began to be resettled by New England Planters. Amongst these new settlers was a young Henry Alline, who in the 1770s would start a Great Awakening religious revival. His New Lights ideas and followers quickly spread across the region and into northeastern New England. Present day Falmouth is home to Avon Valley Greenhouses, Sainte-Famille Wines, the Avon Valley Golf & Country Club, and numerous farms and several small businesses. Falmouth District Elementary School is also located in Falmouth. The village is located exactly halfway between the North Pole and the Equator.

He fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and Peninsular Wars, and was mentioned in dispatches a number of times, most notably for his actions at Talavera, Busaco, Badajoz and Vitoria. Fletcher was twice wounded in the line of duty before being killed in action at the Siege of San Sebastian. Personal life Little is known of Richard Fletcher's early life, even his exact date of birth is obscure. It is known however that the year was 1768 and his father was a clergyman.Heathcote (p.50) On 27 November 1796, at Plymouth, he married Elizabeth Mudge the daughter of a doctor. Fletcher and his wife went on to have five children together; two sons and three daughters. Though Fletcher was buried near to where he was killed at San Sebasti√°n, a monument to his memory, purchased by the Royal Engineers, stands at the western side of the north aisle in Westminster Abbey, London.Heathcote (p.52) Early career Richard Fletcher enrolled as a cadet in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich on 7 October 1782.Heathcote (p.50) He began his career in the Royal Artillery where he became a second-lieutenant on 9 July 1788, before joining the Royal Engineers on 29 June 1790. Fletcher was promoted to lieutenant on 16 January 1793 and when France declared war on Britain, later that year, he was sent to serve in the West Indies. French Revolutionary Wars While in the West Indies, Fletcher played an active role in the successful attacks on the French colonies of Martinique, Gaudeloupe and St Lucia, which occurred between February and April 1794. It was during the capture of St Lucia he received a gunshot wound. Fletcher was transferred to the British controlled island of Dominica where he was appointed chief engineer before being sent home at the end of 1796. While in England, Fletcher served as adjutant to the Royal Military Artificers in Portsmouth until December 1798 when he was sent to Constantinople (now Istanbul) to act as an advisor to the Ottoman Government. Intending to travel through Hanover, Fletcher set sail from England but his ship was wrecked near the mouth of the river Elbe and Fletcher was forced to walk across two miles of ice before reaching land. After three months travelling through Austria and Ottoman territories in the Balkans, Fletcher finally arrived in Constantinople on 29 March 1799. In June 1799, Fletcher, alongside Ottoman troops, advanced into Syria, forcing Napoleon to forgo his siege of Acre and retreat to Egypt.Heathcote (pp.50-51) During 1799, after his return from Syria, Fletcher took part in the preparation of the defences for the Turks in the Dardanelles.Heathcote (p.51) After a spell with Ottoman forces in Cyprus, Fletcher returned to Syria in June 1800, to oversee the construction of fortifications at Jaffa and El Arish. Fletcher served under Sir Ralph Abercromby in December 1800 at Marmaris Bay, practising beach assaults for the expected invasion of Egypt the following year. An expedition to reconnoitre the Egyptian port of Alexandria, led to Fletcher's capture when, while returning to his ship after a night reconnaissance mission ashore, Fletcher was intercepted by a French patrol vessel. He was held prisoner in Alexandria until its capture on 2 September 1801. In October 1801, when the general armistice was signed, Fletcher returned to England, having been promoted to captain while he was imprisoned and later decorated by the Ottoman Empire for his services. The Treaty of Amiens was signed on 25 March 1802 but peace was short-lived and war broke out in May the following year. Fletcher was again sent to Portsmouth where he helped bolster the defences of Gosport. Promoted to major on 2 April 1807, Fletcher took part in the Battle of Copenhagen in August that year. Peninsular War Soon after the start of the Peninsular War, Fletcher was sent to Portugal. He was part of the force that occupied Lisbon when the French withdrew following the Convention of Sintra, after which he accompanied Wellington as his chief engineer in the field. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the army, 2 March 1809, and then the Royal Engineers, 24 June 1809, he fought at the Battle of Talavera (27-28 July 1809) for which he received a mention in dispatches. =Lines of Torres Vedras= The Lines of Torres Vedras constructed to protect Lisbon and provide a line of retreat It was while Wellington was making preparations for a retreat to Portugal, that Fletcher became famous for one of the greatest military engineering feats in history. The celebrated Lines of Torres Vedras were constructed on the narrow peninsula between the Atlantic and the Tagus. These three lines of defence; the first 6 miles in front of the principal one and the last 20 miles behind, were intended to protect Lisbon and provide a line of retreat for the British to their ships should it be required. Fletcher began work on these defences on 20 October 1809, using Portuguese soldiers and civilians for the bulk of the labour. Rocky slopes were steepened and reinforced, and defiles were obstructed with forts and earthworks; trees and vegetation were removed to deprive the enemy of cover and sustenance, watercourses were dammed in order to construct impassable lakes or swamps and any buildings were either fortified or destroyed. Fortifications guarded every approach and batteries commanded the highground, while a system of signal stations and roads ensured that troops could be sent quickly to where they were needed the most.Heathcote (pp.51-52) And all was conducted with the utmost secrecy so that neither Napoleon nor even the British Government were aware of the lines' existence until Wellington was obliged to retreat behind them later the following year.Heathcote (p.52) In July 1810, shortly before completion of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Bu√ßaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Mass√©na, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was an easy one. Wellington's superiors were equally surprised to hear about the defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Mass√©na initially retreated to Santar√©m but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north. =Later campaigns= 1837 engraving of the Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro Fletcher, as part of Wellington's forces, chased Mass√©na to Sabugal where, after some skirmishing, on 2 April, Mass√©na was finally brought to action at the Battle of Sabugal; the first of a number of engagements as Wellington and Mass√©na competed for position along the Portuguese and Spanish border.Heathcote (pp. 52 & 153) After forcing Mass√©na to abandon Sabugal, Wellington turned his attention towards Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo; two fortresses that guarded the northern approach to Portugal. Wellington had planned to capture both while Mass√©na's army was still in disarray but the loss of Badajoz to Marshall Soult on 11 March, which protected the south, compelled him to divide his force.Heathcote (p. 153) Wellington sent a quarter of his troops to reinforce General Beresford's, with orders to re-take Badajoz, while his remaining force, which included Fletcher, would lay siege to Almeida. Mass√©na, now with a superior force, marched to relieve Almeida and Wellington, not wishing to fight under those conditions, withdrew to the town of Fuentes d'Onoro.Heathcote (pp. 153‚Äì154) The town changed hands a number of times during a battle that took place over three days (3‚Äì5 May), but ultimately remained under British control.Heatcote (p. 154) Mass√©nna's troops were neither able to reach the fort nor stay in the open and were thus forced to leave on 8 May. Wellington continued his siege and took possession of Almeida two days later. Badajoz; where Fletcher's engineers suffered heavy losses in two sieges and where in March 1812, Fletcher himself was wounded Fletcher was again mentioned in dispatches when serving as chief engineer at the second siege of Badajoz (19 May ‚Äì 10 June 1811). The engineers suffered many casualties in their attempts to dig the thin rocky soils around a fort that had been repaired and reinforced since the last unsuccessful siege. Running short of ammunition and having sustained heavy losses; and with news that French reinforcements were on the way, Wellington withdrew his forces to Elvas on 10 June.Heathcote (pp. 156‚Äì157) Fletcher was also present when Ciudad Rodrigo (7 ‚Äì 19 January 1812) and, on the third attempt, Badajoz (17 March ‚Äì 16 April 1812) were captured. In the latter engagement it was Fletcher who identified the weak point in the defences and so ultimately decided where the main attack should be.Heathcote (p. 158) On 19 March, Fletcher was shot in the groin when a French sortie in the fog reached the trenches where he and his engineers were working. His injury might have been much worse if it had not been for a Spanish Silver Dollar in his pocket which took the main force of the musket ball. Fletcher's injury had him confined to his tent where Wellington, desperately short of good engineers, visited him daily for advice.Heathcote (p. 158) Fletcher returned to England to recover, and was made a baronet on 14 December 1812, and awarded a pension of ¬£1.00 per diem. He received the Portuguese award of the Order of the Tower and Sword; and the Army Gold Cross for Talavera, Bussaco, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Badajoz.Dictionary of National Biography Vol. 19 (p. 326) Fletcher returned to the Peninsular in 1813 and received a further mention in dispatches for his role in the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June. Fletcher directed the sieges of Pamplona and San Sebasti√°n. He was killed in action during the final assault on San Sebasti√°n on 31 August 1813.

There are two extant ballads under this title, both of which narrate the same story. As ballads existed within oral tradition before being written down, other versions of this once popular song also may have existed. Moreover, other ballads used its tune without necessarily having any connection to \\"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\\". Synopsis Earl Percy hunting in Chevy Chase. Illustration by F. Tayler. Earl Douglas advancing with his men. Illustration by F. Tayler. The death of Earl Douglas. Illustration by F. Tayler. The ballads tell the story of a large hunting party upon a parcel of hunting land (or chase) in the Cheviot Hills (a range of rolling hills straddling the Anglo-Scottish border between Northumberland and the Scottish Borders), hence the term, Chevy Chase. The hunt is led by Percy, the English Earl of Northumberland. The Scottish Earl Douglas had forbidden this hunt and interpreted it as an invasion of Scotland. In response he attacked, causing a bloody battle after which only 110 people survived. Both ballads were collected in Thomas Percy's Reliques and the first of the ballads in Francis James Child's Child Ballads. Different versions were collected in England, Scotland, and the US. Historical basis Scholar Francis J. Child, as well as Thomas Percy, noted similarities between this ballad and the older \\"The Battle of Otterburn\\", which refers to the historical Battle of Otterburn in 1388, although neither set of lyrics is completely historically accurate. Versions of either ballad often contain parallel biographical and historical information; nonetheless, the differences led Child to believe that they did not originally refer to the same occurrence. Simpson suggests that the music of Chevy Chase was identical to the tune of Flying Flame, in which the former superseded the latter by the beginning of the seventeenth century. Versions of \\"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\\" exist in several ballad collections like: the Roxburghe Ballads, the Pepys Library, the Huntington Library Miscellaneous, the Glasgow University Library, and the Crawford Collection at the National Library of Scotland. The ballads in these collections were printed with variations between 1623 and 1760. Online facsimiles of the ballad are also available for public consumption at sites like the English Broadside Ballad Archive. First ballad The first of the two ballads of Chevy Chase was perhaps written as early as the 1430s, but the earliest record we have of it is in The Complaynt of Scotland, one of the first printed books from Scotland. The Complaynt of Scotland was printed in around 1550, and in it the ballad is called The Hunting of Cheviot, while the first manuscript version of the ballad was written 1550 (MS Ashmole 48, Bodleian Library). In the seventeenth century, the tune was licensed in 1624 and again in 1675. Second ballad In 1711 Joseph Addison wrote in The Spectator: > The old song of \\"Chevy-Chase\\" is the favourite ballad of the common people > of England, and Ben Jonson used to say he had rather have been the author of > it than of all his works. Sir Philip Sidney, in his discourse of Poetry [The > Defence of Poesie], speaks of it in the following words: \\"I never heard the > old song of Percy and Douglas that I found not my heart more moved than with > a trumpet; and yet it is sung by some blind crowder with no rougher voice > than rude style, which being so evil apparelled in the dust and cobweb of > that uncivil age, what would it work trimmed in the gorgeous eloquence of > Pindar?\\" For my own part, I am so professed an admirer of this antiquated > song, that I shall give my reader a critique upon it without any further > apology for so doing.The Works of Joseph Addison: Complete in Three Volumes: > Embracing the Whole of the \\"Spectator,\\" &c;, Harper & Brothers, 1837, p.117 Apparently Addison was unaware that the ballad he then goes on to analyse in detail, was not the same work praised by Sidney and Jonson. The second of the ballads appears to have been written in modernized English shortly after Sidney's comments, perhaps around 1620, and to have become the better-known version. Cultural references Edwin Landseer William Hutton, in A Journey from Birmingham to London (1785), mentions \\"the old song of Chevy Chace\\" and its tale about \\"the animosity between England and Scotland\\". In Sir Walter Scott's Rob Roy (1817), the main character, Frank, upon seeing the trophies on the walls of Osbaldistone hall, imagines them being from the Chevy Chase. An early and popular painting of 1825‚Äì6 by Edwin Landseer was titled The Hunting of Chevy Chase. In Emily Bront√´'s Wuthering Heights (1847), before their relationship blossoms, Catherine Heathcliff (n√©e Catherine Linton) scorns Hareton Earnshaw's primitive attempts at reading, saying, \\"I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday; it was extremely funny!\\"Bront√´, Emily: Wuthering Heights, Chapter 31 (Wikisource link) In Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South (1855), on hearing the conversation between Mr. Thornton and her father, Margaret Hale wonders, ‚ÄúHow in the world had they got from cog- wheels to Chevy Chace?‚Äù\\"North and South\\", Chapter 10 (Wikisource link) In F.

Legacy A tract of land in British America was named \\"Cheivy Chace\\" by 1725, and was eventually developed into the modern affluent areas of Chevy Chase, Maryland, and Chevy Chase, Washington, D.C. A golf club in the Maryland Chevy Chase inspired the name of Chevy Chase, Lexington, Kentucky. A shopping mall in the Eldon Square Shopping Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne is named \\"Chevy Chase\\" in allusion to the ballad. The ballad inspired the childhood nickname and adult stage name of the American comedian and actor Chevy Chase (born Cornelius Chase, 1943). The ballad has given the English language the verb to chivvy, meaning to pester or encourage someone to perform a task.

(; 11 July 1844) was lauded by Alexander Pushkin as the finest Russian elegiac poet. After a long period when his reputation was on the wane, Baratynsky was rediscovered by Russian Symbolism poets as a supreme poet of thought.  Biography  A member of the noble , or, more accurately, family, the future poet received his education at the Page Corps at St. Petersburg, from which he was expelled at the age of 15 after stealing a snuffbox and five hundred roubles from the bureau of his accessory's uncle. After three years in the countryside and deep emotional turmoil he entered the army as a private. In 1820 the young poet met Anton Delvig, who rallied his falling spirits and introduced him to the literary press. Soon the military posted Baratynsky to Finland, where he remained for six years. His first long poem, Eda, written during this period, established his reputation. In January 1826 he married the daughter of Major-General Gregory G. Engelhardt. Through the interest of friends he obtained leave from the Emperor to retire from the army, and he settled in 1827 in Muranovo just north of Moscow (now a literary museum). There he completed his longest work, The Gipsy, a poem written in the style of Pushkin. Portrait, 1826 Baratynsky's family life seemed happy, but a profound melancholy remained the background of his mind and of his poetry. He published several books of verse which Pushkin and other perceptive critics praised highly, but which met with a comparatively cool reception from the public, and with violent ridicule on the part of the young journalists of the \\"plebeian party\\". As time went by, Baratynsky's mood progressed from pessimism to hopelessness, and elegy became his preferred form of expression. He died in 1844 at Naples, where he had gone in pursuit of a milder climate.  Poetry  Baratynsky's earliest poems are punctuated by conscious efforts to write differently from Pushkin who he regarded as a model of perfection. Even Eda, his first long poem, though inspired by Pushkin's The Prisoner of the Caucasus, adheres to a realistic and homely style, with a touch of sentimental pathos but not a trace of romanticism. It is written, like all that Baratynsky wrote, in a wonderfully precise style, next to which Pushkin's seems hazy. The descriptive passages are among the best ‚Äî the stern nature of Finland was particularly dear to Baratynsky. His short pieces from the 1820s are distinguished by the cold, metallic brilliance and sonority of the verse. They are dryer and clearer than anything in the whole of Russian poetry before Akhmatova. The poems from that period include fugitive, light pieces in the Anacreontic and Horatian manner, some of which have been recognized as the masterpieces of the kind, as well as love elegies, where a delicate sentiment is clothed in brilliant wit. In his mature work (which includes all his short poems written after 1829) Baratynsky is a poet of thought, perhaps of all the poets of the \\"stupid nineteenth century\\" the one who made the best use of thought as a material for poetry. This made him alien to his younger contemporaries and to all the later part of the century, which identified poetry with sentiment. His poetry is, as it were, a short cut from the wit of the 18th-century poets to the metaphysical ambitions of the twentieth (in terms of English poetry, from Alexander Pope to T. S. Eliot). Baratynsky's style is classical and dwells on the models of the previous century. Yet in his effort to give his thought the tersest and most concentrated statement, he sometimes becomes obscure by sheer dint of compression. Baratynsky's obvious labour gives his verse a certain air of brittleness which is at poles' ends from Pushkin's divine, Mozartian lightness and elasticity. Among other things, Baratynsky was one of the first Russian poets who were, in verse, masters of the complicated sentence, expanded by subordinate clauses and parentheses.  Philosophy  Baratynsky's grave in the cemetery of Alexander Nevsky Lavra Baratynsky aspired after a fuller union with nature, after a more primitive spontaneity of mental life. He saw the steady, inexorable movement of mankind away from nature. The aspiration after a more organic and natural past is one of the main motives of Baratynsky's poetry. He symbolized it in the growing discord between nature's child ‚Äî the poet ‚Äî and the human herd, which were growing, with every generation, more absorbed by industrial cares. Hence the increasing isolation of the poet in the modern world where the only response that greets him is that of his own rhymes (Rhyme, 1841). The future of industrialized and mechanized mankind will be brilliant and glorious in the nearest future, but universal happiness and peace will be bought at the cost of the loss of all higher values of poetry (The Last Poet). And inevitably, after an age of intellectual refinement, humanity will lose its vital sap and die from sexual impotence. Then earth will be restored to her primaeval majesty (The Last Death, 1827). This philosophy, allying itself to his profound temperamental melancholy, produced poems of extraordinary majesty, which can compare with nothing in the poetry of pessimism, except Leopardi. Such is the crushing majesty of that long ode to dejection, Autumn (1837), splendidly rhetorical in the grandest manner of classicism, though with a pronouncedly personal accent.

Early life and education MacLean was born in Zweibr√ºcken, West Germany, at the Zweibr√ºcken Air Base on April 12, 1960, where his father was an officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force and was stationed at the nearby Metz-Frescaty Air Base in Metz, France. Ron MacLean Sr., born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, on May 4, 1922, married Lila MacDonald, from Iona, Nova Scotia, in July 1959. MacLean Sr. worked as a communications operator at Station Edmonton, while MacDonald was an airwoman/clerk stationed at RCAF Station Namao, just outside Edmonton. Fourteen months after MacLean's birth, the family moved back to Canada, initially settling in Chester, Nova Scotia. MacLean was four years old when his dad was stationed in Whitehorse, Yukon, with the Royal Canadian Air Force before relocating eventually in Sylvan Lake, Alberta. He attended high school in Red Deer, Alberta, where he met his future wife Cari. After high school, MacLean was prepared to attend the University of Alberta until he was asked to fill in for a sick friend at CKRD-FM, which led to a job at CKRD-TV. Although he never attended university, MacLean received an honorary degree from the University of Alberta in 2019. Career =Hockey Night in Canada= MacLean (right) with Don Cherry at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah MacLean has worked on Hockey Night in Canada since 1986‚Äì87. He began hosting telecasts in Toronto when Dave Hodge moved to Vancouver. Hodge was later suspended, and eventually quit, protesting a CBC programming decision on-air. He worked his first Stanley Cup Final that spring and has been the early game host ever since. Part of his duties included hosting Coach's Corner with Don Cherry. Contract negotiations with CBC Sports Executive Director Nancy Lee and the president of English television had hit a standstill in the 2001‚Äì02 NHL season. MacLean threatened to leave CBC on the advice of his agent Don Meehan. That made headlines across Canada and following a huge public outcry, the CBC quickly gave in to his demands.Macleancbc1002acaaws.ca/e/leadership/article MacLean in 2013 at a CBC Live event In addition to hosting HNIC, he has been a part of the CBC's Olympics coverage since 1988. He took over as chief anchor following the departure of Brian Williams to CTV/TSN. MacLean was the main sportscaster and host for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing until his mother died, causing him to hand over duties to Scott Russell.olympics-ron- maclean In 1993, MacLean served as an ice level reporter for NBC Sports' coverage of the NHL All-Star Game in Montreal. MacLean has also hosted CBC's coverage of the Queen's Plate. Beginning with the 2014‚Äì15 NHL season, MacLean was hired by Rogers Media when the company acquired the national rights to the NHL. MacLean was removed from the host position of Hockey Night in Canada, but retained his role as host of Coach's Corner, and became an on-location host for the new, travelling Hometown Hockey broadcasts introduced that season. On June 27, 2016, Rogers announced that MacLean would be reinstated as host of the early games on Hockey Night beginning in the upcoming season, replacing George Stroumboulopoulos. Awards and Honours MacLean has won eight Gemini Awards for his work with CBC. His first was in 1992 for Best Sports Broadcaster; he also won the Best Sports Broadcaster award in 1994, 1997, 1998 and 2001. He won Best Host or Interviewer in a Sports Program or Sportscast in 2004 and again in 2006. In 1996, he was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was inducted into the Oakville Sports Hall of Fame. In 2016, MacLean, along with his Coach's Corner co-host Don Cherry, received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. Controversy On January 16, 2010, MacLean presented a pre-game piece together with NHL representative Colin Campbell focusing on Vancouver Canucks player Alexandre Burrows, in follow up to an earlier incident between Burrows and referee St√©phane Auger in which the credibility of Auger was called into question. The piece was considered by a number of prominent sports writers, Canucks coach Alain Vigneault, and some fans to be a one-sided smear against Burrows. MacLean appeared on Vancouver- based sports radio show Team 1040 on January 18, 2010, and strongly denied being biased or one-sided during his presentation. In 2017, MacLean apologized to postal workers after suggesting their jobs were \\"effectively obsolete.\\" On November 9, 2019, MacLean's co-host Don Cherry made remarks during Coach's Corner suggesting that Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans and do not wear remembrance poppies. MacLean, who nodded during Cherry's rant and flashed a thumbs-up sign at the end of Saturday's segment, apologized the following day for staying silent during Cherry's remarks. The following day, Sportsnet president Bart Yabsley announced that Cherry had been fired: \\"Following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night's broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down.\\" The following day, Cherry had expressed his disappointment over MacLean's apology. On November 16, 2019, MacLean addressed and reflected on the incident during Hockey Night in Canada, the first without Cherry, also announcing the end of Coach's Corner. =Hockey Canada= In addition to his work at the CBC, MacLean is a former Level 5 referee with Hockey Canada. He has refereed in junior, minor pro, senior, and university leagues across Canada, mostly in the Southern Ontario region. He served as a referee in the September 29, 2006 NHL preseason matchup of the Buffalo Sabres and the Pittsburgh Penguins, calling one penalty in the final minute of the game. Personal life MacLean was named Honorary Colonel of the 1 Air Movements Squadron at 17 Wing Winnipeg of the Canadian Forces' Air Command. On June 3, 2010, MacLean helped to rescue a man trying to take his own life, by jumping into the Delaware River in Philadelphia. =In popular culture= MacLean is the subject of the song \\"Dear Coach's Corner\\" composed by the Canadian punk band Propagandhi, on their album Supporting Caste. The lyrics of the song are composed in the form of a written letter to MacLean addressing the issue of military propaganda during pre-game ceremonies, an issue that the members of Propagandhi find problematic.

The Commission was authorized by United States Congress in 1893 to execute the General Allotment Act of 1887. Traditionally, the land in these tribal communities had been held communally. With the establishment of the Dawes Commission, the ruling was made by the colonial agents to divide up the land into parcels and institute a system of individual ownership in accordance with US laws, overriding the treaty and tribal laws of the region.Angie Debo, And Still the Waters Run: The Betrayal of the Five Civilized Tribes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1940; new edition, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1984), p.39 . In order to allot the communal lands, citizens of the Five Civilized Tribes (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) were to be enumerated and registered by the US government. These counts also included the freedmen ‚Äì formerly-enslaved African-Americans who had been emancipated after the American Civil War, and their descendants. The rolls were used to assign allotments to heads of household and to provide an equitable division of all monies obtained from sales of surplus lands. These rolls became known as the Dawes Rolls. When word got out that people could get land, many non-Natives appeared at the offices and falsely claimed to be Native. Most of these false claimants claimed to be Cherokee. Family myths still persist of \\"hiding in the hills\\", or of being \\"rejected from the rolls\\", or \\"refusing to enroll\\" when the reason for having not been enrolled is that the applicants were simply not Native American. Note: The fact many tried to understandably avoid this, plus the fact that there were multiple waves of departure on the Trail of Tears, each less and less \\"voluntary\\", has led to the myth that \\"enrollment\\" was somehow optional. If they refused, warrants were issued and people were hunted down by soldiers. They had to sign up or face criminal charges. Enumeration and enrollment The Dawes Commission went to the individual tribes to obtain the membership lists, but it took a series of attempts to gain anything near to an accurate count. In 1898, Congress passed the Curtis Act, which provided that a new roll would be taken and supersede all previous rolls. Difficulties in enumerating the population included the forced migrations of the period as well as the American Civil War. Additionally, non-Native census takers introduced the idea of Blood Quantum, a concept previously foreign to the tribal communities. Those recording this percentage of ancestry wrote down an estimation, based on physical appearance and personal opinion if the individual was present. Tribal citizens were listed under several categories: :*Citizen by Blood :**New Born Citizen by Blood :**Minor Citizens by Blood :*Citizen by Marriage :*Freedmen (persons formerly enslaved by Native Americans and/or adopted by the Cherokee tribe) :**New Born Freedmen :**Minor Freedmen :*Delaware Indians (those adopted by the Cherokee tribe were enrolled as a separate group within the Cherokee) More than 250,000 people applied for membership, and the Dawes Commission enrolled just over 100,000. Most were rejected because they were non-Natives who showed up demanding land, but could not prove any connection to an existing Native community, such as naming living relatives or speaking the Native language. Overrun with prospective claimants, the commission was overwhelmed, and had to institute guidelines: An act of Congress on April 26, 1906, closed the rolls on March 5, 1907. An additional 312 persons were enrolled under an act approved August 1, 1914. While some initially refused to be enumerated, almost all were later arrested and enrolled against their will; enrollment was not a matter of \\"choice.\\" Refusing to be enumerated, and even fleeing, would mean warrants being issued for the person's arrest; they could then be treated brutally and imprisoned in the process of being enrolled by force. Still, due to understandable distrust of the government, there were those who tried to avoid ennumeration. Notable among those who resisted were Muscogee Chitto Harjo (Crazy Snake), and Cherokee Redbird Smith. But both Harjo and Smith were eventually coerced into enrolling. According to Cherokee professor Steve Russell, some Natives hiding in the Cookson Hills never did enroll,Russell (2002) p72 but some of them were later arrested and forcibly enrolled, while others were enrolled on their behalf by people in their communities. Additionally all individuals on the Census Roll of 1896 were enrolled without notification to the parties involved.\\"Redbird Smith\\" at the Cherokee Nation website. The only real choice to avoid enumeration entirely meant completely leaving one's community and assimilating. Since that period, the tribes have relied on the Dawes Rolls as part of the membership qualification process, using them as records of citizens at a particular time, and requiring new members to document direct descent from a person or persons on these rolls. Courts have upheld this rule even when it has been proven that a brother or sister of an ancestor was listed on the rolls but not the direct ancestor himself/herself. Another issue on the Dawes Rolls are people termed \\"Five-Dollar Indians.\\" Some white people bribed government officials in order to get land allotments, but this was not as widespread as some would believe. Gregory Smithers, associate professor of history at Virginia Commonwealth University stated, \\"These were opportunistic white men who wanted access to land or food rations. ... These were people who were more than happy to exploit the Dawes Commission ‚Äì and government agents, for $5, were willing to turn a blind eye to the graft and corruption.\\" For the small minority that managed this, this fraudulent enrollment may have earned white people potential benefits for themselves and their descendants, but also could have subjected them to further removal, relocation or incarceration; there were also land runs during this time, and other ways for white people to get land. Most of the white people on the Dawes roll are noted as included due to marrying a member of the tribe, and having Indian children. The Dawes Rolls, though recognized as flawed, are still essential to the citizenship process of the Nations that include them in their laws. The federal government uses them in determining blood-quantum status of individuals for Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood.

The game allows players to assume the role of commanding officer during the battles of World War II that occurred in Europe and North Africa. Each country has its respective historically correct military units. Similar to the Sudden Strike games Blitzkrieg focuses on battles rather than real-time strategy aspects like base building. Virtual Programming published a Mac OS X version of the game on the Mac App Store on April 20, 2011. Certain versions of the original game, and several sequels, use the StarForce copy protection system. Blitzkrieg Anthology does not appear to use Starforce. Graphics deliver realistic 3-D rendered isometric terrain and details include seasons, climatic zones and weather conditions which can affect game play. Blood is present although it can be deactivated. The game features over 350 different units and objects. The player has the ability to build pontoon bridges, dig trenches, lay mines, resupply and repair units or call in air support but there are no resources. Virtually everything can be destroyed including buildings and bridges. Forests can be flattened by tanks or artillery. Each unit of a respective nation speaks its own language, adding immensely to the immersion. The game shipped with a mission and resource editors for users to create their own units and maps. Gameplay The game is split into three modes: campaign, multiplayer and custom game. Blitzkrieg centers on 3 distinctive campaigns which features some of the major factions battling it out in World War II. They feature the Allies (American and British campaigns), the Germans, and the Soviets. Each of those attempt to chronologically re-enact the time periods of the war by devising Chapters into each of the campaigns. Each player starts with 'core units'. These named units would be the same personnel accompanying the player throughout the chosen Campaign and may gain rank and experience as the player progresses from one Chapter to the other. As they fight, units will expend their ammunition, forcing the player to pay attention. Each of the individual units can be used separately or in groups, and by highlighting vehicles or humans, groups can be created and then called by a button at any time. Because of the dismissal of base-building and unit spawning, strategy is a key ingredient of overall gameplay.  Add-ons  There are three official expansions of the original Blitzkrieg to date, all three were developed by La Plata Studios (Germany) in collaboration with Nival Interactive, the developer of the original Blitzkrieg game. They are published and distributed by CDV Interactive. The base game Blitzkrieg was released together with its three expansions as Blitzkrieg Anthology. *Blitzkrieg: Burning Horizon follows the footsteps of General Erwin Rommel starting from the crossing of the Ardennes to the battles of the Afrika Korps and continuing to the last struggle of German resistance in occupied France. It also includes a new nation, Japan, with unique new units and weaponry (Belgium is also added, in single player only as an enemy), as well as 8 brand new single player missions, in which battles rage in many different countries and islands, from the Pacific island of Papua New Guinea to the jungles of Burma and Singapore and the deserts of Northern Africa and much more. It also includes over 56 new and improved units, including tanks, aircraft, squads, and artillery. *Blitzkrieg: Rolling Thunder traces the career of General George S. Patton during World War II ranging from the deserts of North Africa to the snowy forests of the Ardennes. *Blitzkrieg: Iron Division (also known as Green Devils) , an expansion that requires Blitzkrieg and Rolling Thunder in order to play. Unlike the first two expansions, it is not a full campaign, but a set of 4 custom missions. It follows 9th panzer division's actions in France, Eastern front and Normandy. It also includes Blitzkrieg's 1st airborne campaign called Eagles as well as a few new units and a new campaign: Tank School.  Stand-alone games  *Stalingrad, developed by DTF Games, is a stand-alone game covering the advance toward and the battle for Stalingrad from both the German and Soviet sides. *Talvisota: Icy Hell, developed by Blitzfront Game Studio, is a game based on the Finnish-Russian Winter War in 1939‚Äì1940. *WWI: The Great War, developed by Dark Fox, is a World War I based game built on the Blitzkreg engine. The player assumes the role of the commanding officer of either the armed forces of the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Germany or Austria-Hungary on the battlefields of the Great War with the country's respective weaponry from 1914 to 1918. As of April 2015, the game is now officially available on Steam. *Mission Barbarossa and Kursk, developed by Active Gaming, follows the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and the Battle of Kursk in 1943. *Blitzkrieg: Operation \\"North\\", developed by Dark Fox. Panzerkrieg - Burning Horizon II In October 2007 Hamburg-based La Plata Studios (developers of the Burning Horizon, Rolling Thunder and Green Devils titles) announced that Panzerkrieg - Burning Horizon II would be released during 2008. Initial details are few and far between but, as the project is being produced in conjunction with the head of the original Blitzkrieg team, it is likely to be more than a standard expansion or stand-alone title. By the end of October 2008 the game was released in Germany where it was very successful and sold more copies than any Blitzkrieg 2 extension. In popular culture * In the season 3, episode 4: \\"Sistering\\" of the popular British sitcom Peep Show, character Mark Corrigan plays Blitzkrieg for 5 hours straight during his week off from work. He was supposed to be reading about the Roman Republic, doing sit-ups and learning the clarinet. He ruefully jokes that winning the war for the Nazis is more important. Reception By April 2005, global sales of Blitzkrieg had surpassed 1 million units.

The Council is also connected to 60 national and regional business councils and partner organizations. Its origins date back to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit of 1992, when Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss business entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). He created a forum called \\"Business Council for Sustainable Development\\", which went on to become Changing Course, a book that coined the concept of eco-efficiency. The WBCSD was created in 1995 as a merger of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Industry Council for the Environment and is based at the Maison de la paix in Geneva, Switzerland, with offices in New York and New Delhi. Operations The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are circular economy, Cities and Mobility, Climate and Energy, Food, Land and Water, People and Redefining Value. Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects.https://docs.wbcsd.org/2018/11/Value.Impact.Voice.pdf Impact and influence A 2003 World Bank/IFC commissioned study identified the WBCSD as one of the \\"most influential forums\\" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues. A 2004 Globescan survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization. The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a \\"major role\\" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%). In the 2007's Ethisphere Institute list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked 9th, which made him the 2nd most influential NGO leader.100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics Membership Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to sustainable development. Among its over 180 members are well-known companies such as DuPont, 3M, Nestl√©, BP, Danone and Royal Dutch Shell. WBCSD provides its members with the value, impact and voice to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work. Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development ‚Äì economic, social and environmental. A key element is the personal commitment of the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD‚Äôs policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD‚Äôs work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies. =For√©tica= For√©tica claims to be global network of Spanish speaking businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestaci√≥n √©tica para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to ISO 26000 and supported by CSR Europe Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014 Governance The WBCSD is a member-led organization governed by a Council composed of the Council Members of its member companies.

Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case about Congress's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court decided that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act was unconstitutional, insofar as it allowed states to be sued by private citizens for money damages. Background The plaintiffs were Milton Ash and Patricia Garrett, both employees of the University of Alabama school system. They were disabled under the definition of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Ash was a security guard who had a lifelong history of severe asthma, and Garrett was a nurse who had been diagnosed with breast cancer requiring time- consuming radiation and chemotherapy treatments. Both alleged that they had been discriminated against at their jobs. The University had refused to assign Ash to duties that would alleviate his asthma and insisted on transferring Garrett because of her absences. Ash and Garrett filed a suit in federal court against the University of Alabama for damages, arguing that the University had violated Title I of the ADA, which prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of disability. The University of Alabama responded with a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited the suit. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama dismissed both cases on that ground, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed and held that Congress had expressly abrogated the sovereign immunity of the states. Issue Can Congress abrogate states' immunity under its Fourteenth Amendment power to enforce the Equal Protection Clause? Decision The majority opinion stated that Congress, in enacting the ADA, had satisfied the requirement that it make clear its intention to abrogate state sovereign immunity and allow states to be sued for damages under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the majority opinion also stated that part of the ADA to lack the \\"congruence and proportionality\\" required when Congress exercises its enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment, citing City of Boerne v. Flores (1997). Under the Equal Protection Clause, discrimination against people with disabilities is analyzed by \\"rational basis\\" scrutiny: if the discrimination has a rational basis, it is constitutional. In this case, the Court held that Congress, like the judiciary, was required to use rational basis review of state action, with its presumptions favoring constitutionality. The Supreme Court decided that the legislative record of the ADA \\"fails to show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of irrational state discrimination in employment against the disabled.\\" The Supreme Court stated that the \\"reasonable accommodation\\" requirement of the ADA law failed the congruence and proportionality test despite the hardship exception to the accommodation requirement: \\"The ADA does except employers from the 'reasonable accommodatio[n]' requirement where the employer 'can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.' ¬ß 12112(b)(5)(A). However, even with this exception, the accommodation duty far exceeds what is constitutionally required in that it makes unlawful a range of alternate responses that would be reasonable but would fall short of imposing an 'undue burden' upon the employer. The Act also makes it the employer's duty to prove that it would suffer such a burden, instead of requiring (as the Constitution does) that the complaining party negate reasonable bases for the employer‚Äôs decision. See ibid.\\" The Supreme Court called disability discrimination rational in that hiring non-disabled employees would conserve scarce financial resources by avoiding the need for costly reasonable accommodations: \\"whereas it would be entirely rational (and therefore constitutional) for a state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing facilities, the ADA requires employers to 'mak[e] existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.'\\" Thus, states have rational reasons for violating the part of the ADA law banning policies that have a disparate impact on the disabled. Even in cases of racial discrimination in which the courts apply a different standard of scrutiny to government action from rational basis review, evidence of disparate impact is insufficient: \\"The ADA also forbids 'utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration' that disparately impact the disabled, without regard to whether such conduct has a rational basis. ¬ß 12112(b)(3)(A). Although disparate impact may be relevant evidence of racial discrimination, see Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239 (1976), such evidence alone is insufficient even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.\\" The Supreme Court had held in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp. (1977) that disparate impact was not proof of discrimination based on \\"race, color or national origin,\\" which would trigger strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court considered the burden of proof to be on those who allege a state action toward the disabled to be irrational: \\"Moreover, the State need not articulate its reasoning at the moment a particular decision is made. Rather, the burden is upon the challenging party to negative \\"'any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.'\\" Heller, supra, at 320 (quoting FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993)).\\" The Supreme Court mentioned the government's argument that \\"the inquiry as to unconstitutional discrimination should extend not only to States themselves, but to units of local governments, such as cities and counties.\\" It admitted that local governments \\"are 'state actors' for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment\\" but added, \\"These entities are subject to private claims for damages under the ADA without Congress' ever having to rely on ¬ß 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to render them so. It would make no sense to consider constitutional violations on their part, as well as by the States themselves, when only the States are the beneficiaries of the Eleventh Amendment.\\" Also, \\"States are not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions towards such individuals are rational. They could quite hardheadedly - and perhaps hardheartedly - hold to job-qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled. If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.\\" The ADA, by allowing states to be sued for damages by private plaintiffs for failing to provide reasonable accommodations provided significantly more Fourteenth Amendment protection for people with disabilities than was allowed by Boerne. That level of protection, the Supreme Court held, was not \\"congruent and proportional\\" to the wrong of discrimination against people with disabilities. The Supreme Court did not address the ability of the federal government to sue the states directly or the ability of Congress to subject local governments to private lawsuits, enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws enacted pursuant to Article I, for example. Thus, the ADA did not constitutionally abrogate the states' sovereign immunity. The decision's scope, however, should not be overstated. While it prevents states from being subject to money damages for violations of Title I of the ADA, states are still subject to prospective injunctive relief, under Ex parte Young (1908).Ann Althouse, \\"Vanguard States, Laggard States: Federalism and Constitutional Rights,\\" 152 U.

It is used to assemble the GNU operating system and the Linux kernel, and various other software. It is a part of the GNU Binutils package. The GAS executable is named , the standard name for a Unix assembler. GAS is cross-platform, and both runs on and assembles for a number of different computer architectures. Released under the GNU General Public License v3, GAS is free software.  History  The first version of GAS was published c. 1986-1987. It was written by Dean Elsner, and supported the VAX architecture.  General syntax  GAS supports a general syntax that works for all of the supported architectures. The general syntax includes assembler directives and a method for commenting. = Directives = GAS uses assembler directives (also known as pseudo ops), which are keywords beginning with a period that behave similarly to preprocessor directives in the C programming language. While most of the available assembler directives are valid regardless of the target architecture, some directives are machine dependent. = Comments = GAS supports two comment styles:  Multi-line comments  As in C multi-line comments start and end with mirroring slash-asterisk pairs: /* comment */  Single-Line comments  Single line comments have a few different formats varying on which architecture is being assembled for. * Hash symbols (#) are used for the platforms: i386, x86-64, i960, 68HC11, 68HC12, VAX, V850, M32R, PowerPC, MIPS, M680x0, and RISC-V. * Semicolons (;) are used on: AMD 29k family, ARC, H8/300 family, HPPA, PDP-11, picoJava, Motorola, and M32C. * The at sign (@) is used on the ARM platform. * A double slash (//) is used on the AArch64 platform. * A vertical bar () is used to signify comments when assembling on 680x0. * An exclamation mark (!) on the Renesas SH platform.  Usage  Being the back-end for a popular compiler suite, namely GCC, the GNU Assembler is very widely used in compiling modern open source software. GAS is often used as the assembler on GNU/Linux operating systems in conjunction with other GNU software. A modified version of GAS can also be found in the Macintosh operating system's development tools package since OS X.

The parish is mostly urban and excludes rural outskirts, it includes another church, St Mark's, in which the joint clergy provide less formal and family services. The present building, the oldest in the town, was built in the 12th Century, replacing an earlier Anglo-Saxon church. Two medieval chapels are integrated into the present building. Its core is made from the local sandstone, Bargate stone from the nearby Greensand Ridge, which is found close to the town. Also found around the church is the old Lammas, or 'common', land. The church is set on the town centre thoroughfare, Church Street, in the urban part of the market town that doubles as a commuter and retirement town and is a Grade I-listed building. Social history ;Origins A church has stood on this site since at least the mid- ninth century. It features several carved stones, which are dated between 820-840. A few Anglo Saxon remnants survive in the present structure, which was largely rebuilt in the 12th century. In 1086, the Domesday Book recorded that Ranulf Flambard, justiciar of William Rufus, held Godalming church. The lammas, or common land, complemented a substantial glebe, the funds from which allowed for a grand and spacious structure to be built. ;The church in the European wars of religion and English Civil War Godalming, at the end of King Charles the First's reign, was a Calvinistic stronghold. The vicar at that time, known as Dr. Andrews, was ejected from his living in 1640, and the town welcomed the Calvinistic preacher, Thomas Edwards. As he travelled the 30 miles from London, via the Portsmouth Road, three or four times a week, he would preach to people at certain points along the road. Some of the land around the church and the town belonged to Salisbury Cathedral, and due to the diversity of important clergymen who owned the land, in the 17th Century 'Godalming' became a byword for piety. A proverb of the time says: :He that shall say well, do well, and think well in mind, :Shall as soon come to heaven, as they that dwell at Godalming.Additional Manuscript of the British Museum, 6167, fol. 167 cited by the compilers of the Victoria County History (1911) ;Rectory The rectory, which was considered a manor, was not owned by the church. Therefore, its lay owner appointed a vicar in 1066 named Ulmaer, who held it under Edward the Confessor. Save for 11 years of seizure under the governments of Cromwell it was held by the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury Cathedral between 1128 and 1846. In that year the Ecclesiastical Commissioners took charge of it and it was sold in 1860 to John Simmonds, who devised it to Mr J. Whateley Simmonds. Architectural history Church interior First built during the Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods, the structure has been proven in ecclesiastical records to have been a redevelopment of an Anglo-Saxon church: In the thirteenth century, the cruciform church of the Norman England was converted into a rectangle by the construction of the north and south chapels and the widening of the nave aisles. In the same century, the magnificent oak-timbered spire was constructed, which was clad in lead (and still is to this day). Further building work followed in subsequent centuries, particularly in the 14th century. In the 19th Century, The nave was lengthened and the aisles were extended westwards and widened, and the 20th century saw the construction of a porch in 1911 and vestries in 1925. The structure gained listed status in 1947 and is classed as Grade I. Services A weekday service of Holy Communion, in traditional language, is held on Tuesdays at 12 pm. Holy Communion, according to the Book of Common Prayer of 1662 (in traditional language), is held every Sunday at 8 am. On the second, third and fourth Sundays of the month, Choral Eucharist is held at 10 am. Chapels and paintings Medieval wall painting of St John the Baptist In the two chapel sections are decorative mural paintings and a medieval painting of St John the Baptist. Monuments The church has interior monuments to Judeth Elyott, d.1615: a figure of a lady kneeling before a book on a lectern in an elaborately-decorated aedicule, the cornice surmounted by coat of arms, shields, and end pedestals with skull and hour-glass, and tablet with skull and cross-bones underneath; Thomas and Joan Purvoche, d.1509, John Barker, d.1595 and John and Elizabeth Westbrook. Wall paintings on its window frames have been re-exposed in the 21st century.History of the church (section) Bells The Church has a fine set of bells hung for the traditional English- style of bell-ringing. The tenor weighs just over a tonne and weighs in at 1221kg. In 2017, all of the bells were recast, with the tenor weighing two hundredweight more than previously (now weighing 24 hundredweight, 0 quarters and 4 pounds, or 1221kg). The restoration and recasting were carried out by John Taylor & Co, now Britain's largest church-bell firm.http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Godalming&Submit;=+Go+&DoveID;=GODALMING The bells are rung regularly for the 10 am service in Church, and ringing practice is held on Tuesday evenings.

Eco-efficiency has been proposed as one of the main tools to promote a transformation from unsustainable development to one of sustainable development. It is based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste and pollution. \\"It is measured as the ratio between the (added) value of what has been produced (e.g. GDP) and the (added) environment impacts of the product or service (e.g. S02 emissions).\\" The term was coined by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in its 1992 publication \\"Changing Course,\\" and at the 1992 Earth Summit, eco-efficiency was endorsed as a new business concept and means for companies to implement Agenda 21 in the private sector. Ergo the term has become synonymous with a management philosophy geared towards sustainability, combining ecological and economic efficiency. History Although eco-efficiency is a rather new method, the idea is not. In the early 1970s Paul R. Ehrlich and John Holdren developed the lettering formula I = PAT to describe the impact of human activity on the environment. Furthermore, the concept of eco-efficiency was first described by McIntyre and Thornton in 1978, but it wasn't until 1992, when the term was formally coined and widely publicized by Stephan Schmidheiny in Changing Course. Schmidheiny set out \\"to change the perception of industry as being part of the problem of environmental degradation to the reality of its becoming part‚Äîa key part‚Äîof the solution for sustainability and global development.\\" The major drivers in the early phase of eco-efficiency's development were the \\"forward-looking managers and thinkers in 3M and Dow.\\" It was their involvement which catapulted eco-efficiency from a brilliant idea to a workable concept. The results of the WBCSD's work creating the \\"linkage between environmental performance and the bottom line was published in 1997 in its report Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value.\\" Methods According to the WBCSD definition, eco-efficiency is achieved through the delivery of \\"competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing environmental impacts of goods and resource intensity throughout the entire life-cycle to a level at least in line with the Earth's estimated carrying capacity.\\" It works by implementing 4 main types of ratios. : \\"The first two are environmental productivity and its inverse, environmental intensity of production, referring to the realm of production. The second pair, environmental improvement cost and its inverse, environmental cost-effectiveness, are defined from an environmental improvements measures point-of-view.\\" The ratios may be applied to any unit comprising economic activities because such activities always relate to cost and value, \\"and having some physical substrate, always influence the environment.\\" Furthermore, there are two different levels upon which to orchestrate the ratios: micro and macro. There are three different methods to determine eco-efficiency at the micro-level. First, incremental eco- efficiency, which \\"specifies the effects of the total value of a product system or sector and its total concomitant environmental effects.\\" Second, an analysis method nicknamed win-win, which \\"gives a comparison between a historical reference situation and potentially new situations based on the use of new technologies.\\" The win-win micro-method is limited because it cannot give a concrete answer on the question of whether it improves overall environmental performance. And the third is difference eco-efficiency, which is similar to the win-win variant, but removes all irrelevant alternatives to heighten potential for optimal technologies while comparing two alternatives. Now the macro-level is much less defined and has shown less accurate results. However, \\"the ultimate aim of eco-efficiency analysis is to help move micro- level decision making into macro-level optimality.\\" The main goal in years to come is to create headline indicators to carry out macro-level analysis at a country/world scale. There are two life-cycle assessment (LCA)‚Äìbased calculation systems on eco-efficiency: the analysis method of BASF, and the method of the eco-costs value ratio of the Delft University of Technology. Uses The reduction in ecological impacts translates into an increase in resource productivity, which in turn can create a competitive advantage. According to the WBCSD, critical aspects of eco-efficiency are:Lovins, L. Hunter (2008). Rethinking production in State of the World 2008, p. 34. * A reduction in the material intensity of goods or services; * A reduction in the energy intensity of goods or services; * Reduced dispersion of toxic materials; * Improved recyclability; * Maximum use of renewable resources; * Greater durability of products; * Increased service intensity of goods and services. Strategies that have been linked to eco-efficiency include \\"Factor 4\\" and \\"Factor 10\\", which call for specific reductions in resource use, \\"natural capitalism\\", which incorporates eco-efficiency as part of a broader strategy, and the \\"cradle-to-cradle\\" movement, which claims to go beyond eco- efficiency in abolishing the very idea of waste. According to Boulanger,http://sapiens.revues.org/index1022.html Boulanger, P.M. (2010) \\"Three strategies for sustainable consumption\\". S.A.P.I.EN.S. 3 (2) all versions of eco-efficiency share four key characteristics: * Confidence in technological innovation as the main solution to un-sustainability; * Reliance on business as the principal actor of transformation. The emphasis is on firms designing new products, shifting to new production processes, and investing in R&D;, etc., more than on the retailer or the consumer, let alone the citizen. * Trust in markets (if they are functioning well); * \\"Growthphilia\\": there is nothing wrong with growth as such. The view that improvements in eco- efficiency are sufficient for achieving sustainability has been challenged by Huesemann and Huesemann,Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011). Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment, Chapter 5, \\"In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements\\", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada. who demonstrate using extensive historical evidence that increases in technological efficiency have not reduced overall resource use and pollution. Moreover, with \\"cradle-to-cradle\\", growth is conducive to sustainability per se. This broader concept is called Sustainable Production and Consumption (SPC). \\"This concept involves changes in production and consumption patterns that lead to sustainable use of natural resources;\\" business has taken a key role in accelerating the use of this concept because businesses both consume and produce. Eco-efficiency is routinely a concept used because it combines performance along two of the three axes of sustainable development, making it easier for academics and leading thinkers to tease out the associated social issues. =Examples= Furthermore, eco- efficiency is also a very useful tool because it can adapt and flex to be fit different sizes of companies, while also maintaining relevance with the larger scale of government and national policies. For example, larger national players such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2002), European Commission (EU 2005), European Environment Agency (EEA) and the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) have all recognized that eco-efficiency is a practical approach that businesses should adopt in setting and achieving their environmental performance objectives.Government of Canada. (2011, October 06). Eco-efficiency. Retrieved from It has been proven to heighten market values for firms, serve as an effective management tool for governments, benefit civil society, and increase quality of life. \\"It does this by changing industrial processes, creating new products and changing and influencing markets with new ideas and with new rules.\\" More people aim to get more value for their money in the market, while also enjoying a better environment. Recently, there has also been use of eco- efficiency in more non-traditional ways, such as a use in banks to integrate environmental criteria into their credit-approval process; looking at \\"eco- integrated economic risks of a customer.\\" And is also being implemented as marketing advantages where, \\"eco-efficient choices are always preferred,\\" especially in service sectors such as tourism.

CSA publishes standards in print and electronic form, and provides training and advisory services. CSA is composed of representatives from industry, government, and consumer groups. CSA began as the Canadian Engineering Standards Association (CESA) in 1919, federally chartered to create standards. During World War I, lack of interoperability between technical resources led to the formation of a standards committee. CSA is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada, a crown corporation which promotes efficient and effective standardization in Canada. This accreditation verifies that CSA is competent to carry out standards development and certification functions, and is based on internationally recognised criteria and procedures. The CSA registered mark shows that a product has been independently tested and certified to meet recognized standards for safety or performance. History During World War I, lack of interoperability between technical resources led to frustration, injury, and death. Britain requested that Canada form a standards committee. Sir John Kennedy, as chairman of the Civil Engineers' Canadian Advisory Committee, led the investigation into the necessity of an independent Canadian standards organization. As a result, the Canadian Engineering Standards Association (CESA) was established in 1919. CESA was federally chartered to create standards. At the beginning, they attended to specific needs: aircraft parts, bridges, building construction, electrical work, and wire rope. The first standards issued by CESA were for steel railway bridges, in 1920. The CSA certification mark In 1927, CESA published the Canadian Electrical Code. Enforcing the code called for product testing, and in 1933, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario became the sole source for testing nationwide. In 1940, CESA assumed responsibility for testing and certifying electrical products intended for sale and installation in Canada. CESA was renamed the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) in 1944. The certification mark was introduced in 1946. In the 1950s, CSA established international alliances in Britain, Japan, and the Netherlands, to expand its scope in testing and certification. Testing labs were expanded from their first in Toronto, to labs in Montreal, Vancouver, and Winnipeg. In the 1960s, CSA developed national Occupational Health and Safety Standards, creating standards for headgear and safety shoes. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the CSA began to expand its involvement in consumer standards, including bicycles, credit cards, and child resistant packaging for drugs. In 1984, CSA established QMI, the Quality Management Institute for registration of ISO9000 and other standards. In 1999, CSA International was established to provide international product testing and certification services while CSA shifted its primary focus to standards development and training. In 2001, these three divisions were joined under the name CSA Group. In 2004, OnSpeX was launched as the fourth division of CSA Group. In 2008, QMI was sold to SAI-Global for $40 million. In 2009, CSA purchased SIRA. Standards development CSA exists to develop standards. Among the fifty-seven different areas of specialization are business management and safety and performance standards, including those for electrical and electronic equipment, industrial equipment, boilers and pressure vessels, compressed gas handling appliances, environmental protection, and construction materials. Most standards are voluntary, meaning there are no laws requiring their application. Despite that, adherence to standards is beneficial to companies because it shows products have been independently tested to meet certain standards. The CSA mark is a registered certification mark, and can only be applied by someone who is licensed or otherwise authorised to do so by the CSA. CSA developed the CAN/CSA Z299 series, now called N299, of quality assurance standards, which are still in use today. They are an alternative to the ISO 9001 quality management standard, specific to companies supplying goods to nuclear power plants. Laws and regulations in most municipalities, provinces and states in North America require certain products to be tested to a specific standard or group of standards by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL). Currently forty percent of all the standards issued by CSA are referenced in Canadian legislation. CSA's sister company CSA International is a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory which manufacturers can choose, usually because the law of the jurisdiction requires it, or the customer specifies it.

He was ennobled in the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1885 and was the 1905 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.Adolf von Baeyer: Winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry 1905 Armin de Meijere Angewandte Chemie International Edition Volume 44, Issue 48, Pages 7836 ‚Äì 7840 2005 Abstract Family and education Adolf von Baeyer's father, Prussian lieutenant-general Johann Jacob Baeyer, the noted geodesist Baeyer was born in Berlin as the son of the noted geodesist and lieutenant-general in the Royal Prussian Army Johann Jacob Baeyer and his wife Eugenie Baeyer n√©e Hitzig (1807‚Äì1843). Both his parents were Lutherans at the time of his birth and he was raised in the Lutheran religion.Baeyer, Adolf Ritter von in Deutsche Biographie His mother was the daughter of Julius Eduard Hitzig and a member of the originally Jewish Itzig family, and had converted to Christianity before marrying his father, who was of non-Jewish German descent. Baeyer had four sisters: Clara (born 1826) Emma (born 1831), Johanna (Jeanette) (born 1839), Adelaide (died 1843) and two brothers: Georg (born 1829) and Edward (born 1832). Baeyer lost his mother at a young age while she was giving birth to his sister Adelaide. Although his birth name was Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf Baeyer, he was known simply as \\"Adolf Baeyer\\", throughout most of his life. The poet Adelbert von Chamisso and the astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel were his godparents. On his 50th birthday he was raised to the hereditary nobility by King Ludwig II of Bavaria, conferring on him the ‚Äúvon‚Äù distinction. Baeyer charted his own path into science early on, performing experiments on plant nutrition at his paternal grandfather's M√ºggelsheim farm as a boy; back in the confines of Berlin, he took to the test tubes with chemical experimentation starting at the age of nine. Three years later, he synthesized a previously unknown chemical compound -double carbonate of copper and sodium. On his 13th birthday, he initiated his lifework, buying a chunk of indigo worth two Thalers for his first dye experiments. When still a schoolboy, his chemistry teacher at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium appointed him as his assistant. After graduating from secondary school in 1853, he entered the Berlin University to study physics and mathematics. A stint in the Prussian army interrupted his study until 1856, when he returned to academia at the University of Heidelberg, intending to study chemistry under Robert Bunsen. After an argument with the renowned chemist, however, he changed his mentor to August Kekul√©. He continued to collaborate with Kekule even after he returned to Berlin in 1858 for the completion of his doctorate on arsenic methyl chloride, or cacodylic. Academic career and achievements After completing his doctorate, he followed Kekul√© to the University of Ghent, when Kekul√© became professor there. He became a lecturer at the Berlin Gewerbeinstitut () in 1860 and a Professor at the University of Strasbourg in 1871. In 1875, he succeeded Justus von Liebig as Chemistry Professor at the University of Munich. Baeyer's chief achievements include the synthesis and description of the plant dye indigo, the discovery of the phthalein dyes, and the investigation of polyacetylenes, oxonium salts, nitroso compounds (1869) and uric acid derivatives (1860 and onwards) (including the discovery of barbituric acid (1864), the parent compound of the barbiturates). He was the first to propose the correct formula for indole in 1869, after publishing the first synthesis three years earlier. His contributions to theoretical chemistry include the 'strain' (Spannung) theory of triple bonds and strain theory in small carbon rings. See especially pages 2277-2281. In 1871 he discovered the synthesis of phenolphthalein by condensation of phthalic anhydride with two equivalents of phenol under acidic conditions (hence the name). That same year he was the first to obtain synthetic fluorescein, a fluorophore pigment which is similar to naturally occurring pyoverdin that is synthesised by microorganisms (e.g., by some fluorescent strains of Pseudomonas). Baeyer named his finding \\"resorcinphthalein\\" as he had synthesised it from phthalic anhydride and resorcinol. The term fluorescein would not start to be used until 1878. In 1872 he experimented with phenol and formaldehyde; the resinous product was a precursor for Leo Baekeland's later commercialization of Bakelite. In 1881 the Royal Society of London awarded Baeyer the Davy Medal for his work with indigo. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1884. In 1905 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"in recognition of his services in the advancement of organic chemistry and the chemical industry, through his work on organic dyes and hydroaromatic compounds\\", and he continued in full active work as one of the best-known teachers in the world of organic chemistry up to within a year of his death.

(2010). Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music. Routledge. . Pp. 201-202. Life The son of \\"a sharecropper who was a shape-note singing-school teacher,\\" Hess was born in Mt. Pisgah, near Athens, in Limestone County, Alabama. His parents were Stovall and Lydia Hess. He was the youngest of 12 children. Hess's entry on the Encyclopedia of Alabama's website says of his name: \\"His parents did not officially name him, so the attending physician entered his name as 'Man Child' Hess in official documents.\\" When he registered with the draft board in Lincoln, Nebraska, he gave his name as \\"William Jesse Hess.\\" In 1997, when Hess was preparing to get a passport to travel overseas, he discovered that his birth certificate actually read Manchild Hess. His son, Jake Jr., named his recording company Manchild Records in honor of his father. Career Hess' career started at the age of 16, when he joined the popular John Daniel Quartet in 1943, making his recorded debut on \\"Just a Prayer Away\\". (He had previously sung with Louie Auten and the Tennessee Valley Boys.) After that, he sang with three of his brothers as the Hess Brothers Quartet. He also sang with the Sunny South Quartet and their rival, the Melody Masters Quartet. In the latter part of his life, Hess sang with The Old Friends Quartet which was featured on the Bill Gaither Homecoming videos. =Statesmen Quartet= Hess sang lead with the Statesmen Quartet from 1948 until 1963. Their recordings included projects long-term with RCA Victor. In 1977-1978 Hess reunited with the surviving members of The Statesmen Quartet, Hovie Lister, Doy Ott, and Rosie Rozell to record three projects, including \\"Songs Elvis Loved\\". The reunited Statesmen sung at Elvis's funeral. In the fall of 1980, Hess, Lister, and Rozell assembled a new group with James Blackwood and J.D. Sumner. As a result, the southern gospel group the Masters V was born. They toured from 1981 until 1988 when illnesses prompted several of the members to retire from full-time singing. =The Imperials= Upon leaving the Statesmen Quartet at the end of 1963, Hess formed his \\"dream\\" group, the Imperials. Although they were not immediately accepted by his peers because of their innovative use of electric guitars and drums, they went on to become pioneers in Contemporary Christian Music, and would eventually be inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. They backed Elvis Presley from 1966 to 1971. Elvis has been quoted as noting Hess as his favorite singer. Hess left the Imperials in 1967 due to health problems. =The Jake Hess Sound= Hess also sang with his children, Becky and Chris, in a group he named \\"The Jake Hess Sound\\". In the late 1970s, Hess and his son Chris were featured singers on the television broadcasts of evangelist Dr. Gene Scott. =With Elvis Presley= Jake Hess was an idol of Elvis Presley, and had a major influence on Presley's career. As a teenager, Presley would attend gospel sings and Hess's style so impressed Elvis, that Presley would emulate it for the remainder of his life. Hess sang backup on several albums recorded by Elvis, and also sang at Presley's funeral in 1977. https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/nyregion/jake-hess-76-gospel-pioneer-and- inspiration-to-presley.html?_r=0 =Solo career= Jake Hess was a noted soloist in his own right. He had won several Grammy Awards on RCA Victor as a solo artist. His last 12 years, he appeared on the Gaither Homecoming concerts and videos. These videos featured Hess from noted concerts in the U.S. at the Kennedy Center, the Ryman Auditorium, and Hawaiian islands and Europe. =Television= Hess had The Jake Hess Show on WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee and performed in the Old Time Singing Convention. Family Hess and Joyce McWaters were married on October 5, 1952. They had three children. Jake Hess, Jr. has become a well-known southern gospel songwriter, in addition to being married to Judy Martin of The Martins. In 1989 Jake's nephew Steve Hess & Eugene Baker (Hess & Baker, Skylite/Sing) were in Nashville to record several segments on Bobby Jones Gospel (BET Network). Jake accompanied them to the studio and liked what he heard. While they were visiting with Jake in Brentwood, he asked whether they would be interested in forming with him a new version of Jake Hess & Friends. The group would ultimately consist of Jake, Steve, Eugene & Chris, Jake's son. They started rehearsals in Jake's family room and started touring later in the year. There were several dates in Missouri and Florida, but Jake determined that the traveling was going to be more demanding than he anticipated, so by 1990 the tours were put on hold with the possibility of doing something with television. Jake Hess III continues the family's musical heritage by singing in the highly acclaimed The Voices of Lee, part of Lee University in Cleveland, TN. Book In 1995, Hess's autobiography, Nothin' but Fine: The Music and the Gospel According to Jake Hess, was published by Buckland Press. Death Hess died January 4, 2004, in Opelika, Alabama after suffering a heart attack December 14, 2003, just days after a performance in Atlanta, Georgia. He was survived by a daughter, two sons, 10 grandchildren, one great-grandchild and a sister.

It is the spinal arterial road of the peninsula and runs parallel to the nearby Caltrain line along much of the route. For much of its length, the highway is named El Camino Real and formed part of the historic El Camino Real mission trail. It passes through and near the historic downtowns of many Peninsula cities, including Burlingame, San Mateo, Redwood City, Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and Sunnyvale, and through some of the most walkable and transit-oriented neighborhoods in the region. Route description Route 82 at the intersection with Mathilda Avenue (Sunnyvale) Historic El Camino Real marker in Santa Clara At its south end SR 82 starts as The Alameda at I-880 in San Jose. Once it enters Santa Clara, it bends north-east around Santa Clara University and onto El Camino Real, where it continues for the remainder of its trip up the San Francisco Peninsula, paralleling the Caltrain corridor. SR 82, generally called \\"El Camino\\" by local residents, runs through a number of cities on the Peninsula, including Palo Alto (passing by Stanford University), San Carlos, San Mateo, Burlingame, and Millbrae, and it is a central artery of the Peninsula communities through which it passes. In Daly City, SR 82 becomes Mission Street, connecting with San Francisco's Mission Street, but then quickly flows onto San Jose Avenue, crossing Alemany Boulevard, and terminating at I-280. SR 82 takes an inland course paralleling US 101. The entire route is at street level with at least four lanes of traffic; no portions of it exist as a freeway, although the route is occasionally a divided highway. The Bayshore Freeway and I-280 tend to provide faster alternatives than Route 82 even during traffic jams on those freeways. From 1964 to 1968, SR 82 continued past its current end north on Alemany Boulevard to Bayshore Boulevard in San Francisco (see below). Prior to 2013, SR 82 continued past its current south end on The Alameda, becoming Santa Clara St. in Downtown San Jose then turning south on Montgomery St. (southbound) / Autumn St. (northbound); then it turned east on San Carlos St. It turned south on Market St., which becomes 1st St. and then Monterey Highway. It followed Monterey Highway until it turned east briefly on Blossom Hill Road, where it ended at US 101. This relinquished segment south of I-880 within San Jose is legally no longer a state highway, but the state's Streets and Highways Code mandates that the City of San Jose is still required to maintain \\"signs directing motorists to the continuation of Route 82\\" and \\"ensure the continuity of traffic flow\\" on this segment. Signs along US 101, I-280, and SR 87 where these relinquished segments intersect still have SR 82 shields. Though as of 2017, certain signs with SR 82 shields have been removed along US 101 near Blossom Hill Road and Capitol Expressway. SR 82 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History Originally a segment of US 101 (and before that, the historic El Camino Real), the highway became completely inadequate for the needs of traffic with the rapid growth of the San Francisco Bay Area after World War II, including urbanization of the towns along its path. The Bayshore Highway to the east was originally built as \\"Bypass (BYP) US 101\\" and was upgraded to a freeway in 1937. With this upgrade, the original US 101 route was transferred to the Bayshore Freeway, and El Camino Real became US 101 BYP, but in response to protests, the switch in designations was reversed two years later, in 1939, and the Bayshore Freeway remained US 101 BYP until 1964.Oakland Tribune, October 1, 1939: \\"The Pacheco Pass road, a good connection between coast and inland routes, is reached over pavement via U.S. 101 or U.S. 101 Bypass to San Jose...\\" In 1964, US 101 was moved again onto the Bayshore Freeway, and its former alignment on El Camino Real became SR 82. It was defined as two portions: From Route (US) 101 near Ford Road south of San Jose to Route (US) 101 in San Francisco (which today corresponds to the Alemany Maze), and from Route (US) 101 near Alemany Boulevard to Route (SR) 87 (current unconstructed SR 230) in San Francisco. In 1968, the portions from I-280 (at current SR 82) to US 101 and from SR 101 to SR 87 were transferred to I-280. SR 87 was then deleted north of SR 237 in 1980, and is only constructed south of US 101, and SR 82 today is designated as part of El Camino Real. In 2013, SR 82 was relinquished south of I-880 through San Jose. However, the state's Streets and Highways Code states that the City of San Jose is still required to \\"ensure the continuity of traffic flow on the relinquished former portion of Route 82\\" along The Alameda into downtown San Jose, and from there along Monterey Road to its former terminus at Blossom Hill Road and US 101. The city also has the further option to apply to make this segment a business route. =Grand Boulevard Initiative= The Grand Boulevard Initiative is a partnership of nineteen Bay Area transit agencies and municipalities that operate or manage various portions of the route. Although El Camino Real is ultimately under the stewardship of Caltrans, the organization nevertheless sponsors aesthetic and infrastructural improvements along the corridor and its neighboring parcels in order to revitalize the streetscape and promote density and more walkable and transit-oriented development.

The school is located in four buildings within the Upper East Side of Manhattan. History The Dalton School, originally called the Children's University School, was founded by Helen Parkhurst in 1919. Parkhurst's \\"Dalton Plan\\", to which the school still adheres, reflected the Progressive Education movement of that had begun in the late nineteenth century. After experimentation in her own one- room school with Maria Montessori, Helen Parkhurst visited other progressive schools in Europe including Bedales School and its founder and headmaster John Haden Badley in England. She developed what she termed the Dalton Plan, which called for teachers and students to work together toward individualized goals. The Laboratory Plan was first put into effect as an experiment in the high school of Dalton, Massachusetts, in 1916. The estate of her benefactor Josephine Porter Boardman, was also near the town of Dalton and from this beginning the Laboratory Plan and school eventually took their names. In 1919, Helen Parkhurst relocated to New York City, where she opened her first school on West 74th Street. Larger facilities soon became necessary; the Lower School was moved to West 72nd Street, and the High School opened in the autumn of 1929 in the current building at 108 East 89th Street. Eleanor Roosevelt admired the work of Helen Parkhurst and played an important role in expanding the population and resources of the school by promoting a merger between the Todhunter School for girls (founded by Winifred Todhunter) and Dalton in 1939. Enlarged and modified through the years, Dalton still celebrates many of the school-wide traditions begun by Helen Parkhurst, including the Candlelighting Ceremony (the last day before winter break), Greek Festival (performed by sixth graders), and Arch Day (the last day of school). The Dalton Plan 91st Street \\"Little Dalton\\" Inspired by the progressive education movement that began in the late 19th century, educational thinkers such as John Dewey, Helen Parkhurst devised what she called the Dalton Plan. Aiming to achieve a balance between each child's talents and the needs of the growing American community, Parkhurst created an educational model with three objectives: to tailor each student's program to his or her needs, interests, and abilities; to promote both independence and dependability; and to enhance the student's social skills and sense of responsibility toward others. The Dalton Plan continues to definine the school's approach to education, encompassing House, Assignment, and Lab. Recognition Dalton School's main building for grades 4-12, nicknamed \\"Big Dalton\\" With regard to elite college admissions per dollar of tuition, Dalton ranked 8th in a 2004 Wall Street Journal survey. Over the years, the Dalton Plan has been adopted by schools around the world, including schools in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, the Czech Republic, England, Korea, the Netherlands, and Japan. Arts and artists in residence Dalton also offers many programs in the arts, particularly the visual arts and music, dance, and theater. At least two full-year arts credits are required for graduation, but many students take art for all four years; moreover, students are encouraged to pursue their interests outside of their academic curriculum. Dalton has various artist-in-residence programs; Carmino Ravosa was Dalton's composer-in-residence for 21 years. Dalton's \\"Original Minds Scholar\\" program has included other artists such as sculptor Sarah Sze (2003‚Äì2004), poet Natasha Tretheway (2006-2007), and author/illustrator David Macaulay. Athletics and other co-curricular activities The Dalton School is a part of the Ivy Preparatory School League in athletics. Some teams, such as varsity football, participate in different athletic conferences. Dalton offers 23 varsity teams (including a cheerleading squad) and nine junior varsity teams in the high school athletics program. The school colors were historically gold and blue, although they have been changed to blue and white (based on common misunderstanding). The sports range from horseback riding, alpine skiing, and sailing, to soccer and lacrosse. The school's mascot is a tiger whose name is Ivan. The Daltonian is Dalton's official student newspaper and is published every 2‚Äì3 weeks by the High School students. Middle and High School students also produce other publications, including the political journal Realpolitik, literary magazine Blue Flag, visual art magazine Fine Arts, photography magazine Shutterbug, and a middle school blog, the Dalton Paw. Additionally, Dalton has one of the best Model Congress teams in the nation, routinely placing first at top conferences including Princeton, Yale, and Harvard. Admission Dalton is known for the diversity of its staff and students. As of this date, admission to Dalton was according to the following criteria. For kindergarten to third grade, admission is based on school records, ERB testing, and interview. For grades 4‚Äì12, admission is based on school records, writing samples, an interview, and standardized testing (e.g., the Independent School Entrance Examination and the Secondary School Admission Test). Candidates receive notification of acceptance, rejection, or wait list in February. As of early 2013, the overall acceptance rate for grades K‚Äì12 at Dalton was reported by Peterson's to be 14%. Parental anxiety created by the highly competitive admission process was the subject of press coverage from 1999-2001. Long seen as a bastion of privilege, Dalton's efforts to broaden its mandate for diversity have met with some difficulty. In 2010, a financial aid budget of $6.5 million supported an outreach program for socio-economic diversity at the school. As of this date, students of color made up 38% of the Dalton First Program. In the 2008‚Äì2009 school year, the kindergarten was composed of 44% children of color. Articles in The New York Times and The Atlantic have described difficulties experienced by some African-American children at the school.

The album is composed mainly of material that originally surfaced during the band's early years as Majesty, and it is the only Dream Theater album to be recorded with their full original lineup that featured Charlie Dominici on vocals, as James LaBrie replaced Dominici as the lead vocalist on all subsequent albums. History The band was originally formed in 1985 by founding members John Myung (bass), Mike Portnoy (drums), and John Petrucci (guitar) under the name Majesty, which was inspired by Portnoy's commentary on the ending of \\"Bastille Day\\" by Rush. After the band found a keyboardist in schoolmate Kevin Moore, the band hosted auditions and settled on Chris Collins as the lead vocalist. The band, still titled Majesty, recorded The Majesty Demos between 1985 and 1986, but shortly thereafter, it was forced to change their name after another band decided to take legal action. While touring around New York, Collins left the band, and the band went through many lead singers before settling in with experienced vocalist Charlie Dominici. Still trying to come up with ideas to rename their band, Portnoy's father suggested the name Dream Theater, which was the name of a nearby movie theater. They accepted the name, and eventually signed their first recording contract with Mechanic/MCA. The album was then recorded during the summer of 1988 at Kajem/Victory Studios in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, notable for the recording of Operation: Mindcrime by Queensr√øche, and the whole process took three months. With the relatively warm reception of their original demos, the band expected their debut album to be received with much fanfare and buzz, but the album went largely unnoticed by the music industry, and eventually led to Mechanic/MCA cutting their contract ties with the band, resulting in a small club tour for the album exclusively in the New York area. They also produced two singles, \\"Status Seeker\\" and \\"Afterlife\\", whose remixes and single edits for radio were done by Terry Brown of Rush production fame. Due to tensions within the band and creative differences, Dominici was fired from the band, and they were without a lead singer until late 1990. 15th anniversary performance On the 15th anniversary of the album, the band performed it in its entirety in Los Angeles. Furthermore, during two additional songs in the encore, special guests Dominici and Derek Sherinian (both now former Dream Theater members) performed along with the rest of the band; however, original keyboardist Kevin Moore did not appear. The entire performance was recorded live and later released on CD and DVD under the title When Dream and Day Reunite through Portnoy's independent label YtseJam Records. The album also featured a live version of \\"Metropolis‚ÄîPart I\\", which was originally from the band's 1992 album Images and Words, and a performance of a B-side from Awake called \\"To Live Forever\\", both originally written shortly after the release of When Dream and Day Unite, and played live on the tour for the album. Critical reception When Dream and Day Unite did not receive much attention upon release, but due to the commercial success of Images and Words, the album would later receive critical reviews and criticism from many resources. Robert Taylor of AllMusic remarked an obvious Queensr√øche influence in the band's \\"progressive metal\\" music and defined Petrucci and Portnoy \\"competent musicians\\", whose \\"individual styles were not yet refined\\"; he criticized the \\"subpar singing, too many metal clich√©s, and poor production\\", but added that the album has \\"enough interesting playing to make it a worthwhile listen for fans of this genre.\\" Canadian journalist Martin Popoff reviewed positively the album which contained \\"startingly progressive yet very heavy and explosive prog metal\\", but criticized the \\"clattery, thin production of Terry Date\\" and the sound of keyboards and drums. This is the only Dream Theater album that failed to chart on the Billboard 200.

It was marketed by Eagle, replacing the AMC/Renault-designed Eagle Premier (from which the Vision was derived). The Eagle Vision was badged as the Chrysler Vision in Europe. The Vision debuted at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. As one of the LH sedans, it was Automobile Magazine's Automobile of the Year in 1993, and ultimately the only Eagle model to be completely designed and built in-house by Chrysler. Design background 1995 Eagle Vision TSi rear The Vision's design can be traced to 1986, when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage. It was also at this time that the Chrysler Corporation purchased bankrupt Italian sports car manufacturer Lamborghini. The Navajo's exterior design was reworked and became the Lamborghini Portofino, released as a concept at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler's decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino's revolutionary exterior design, called \\"cab-forward.\\" The cab forward design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a larger passenger cabin than the contemporaries of the time. Design of the chassis began in the late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought another automaker: American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987, from which the Eagle division is derived. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler Fifth Avenue as well as a potential Plymouth. The initial design of Dodge's LH bore resemblance to the Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after Fran√ßois Castaing, formerly AMC's Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988. The new design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the Eagle Premier. The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler concepts: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and 1990 Eagle Optima. The Premier's longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or rear-wheel drive (designated \\"LH\\" and \\"LX\\" respectively). The transmission was inspired by the Premier's Audi and ZF automatics. Borrowing heavily from Chrysler's A604 (41TE) \\"Ultradrive\\" transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE). 1995 Eagle Vision ESi By 1990, it was decided that the new technologically advanced car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3 L pushrod V6. The 3.3 L engine's 60¬∞ block was bored out to 3.5 L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with SOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5 L V6. The appearance, still based on the cab forward exterior design of the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino concept, with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. The engineering and sleek styling gives the Vision a low drag coefficient (0.31), on par with the Porsche 997. Without badges, the Vision could easily pass as a (first-generation) Concorde. The main difference between the two are the taillight clusters. Like the European sedans it was marketed to compete against, the Vision incorporates rear amber turn signals over the Concorde's red ones. Neither does the Vision have the Concorde's faux rear lightbar between the taillights. While the two cars share headlights, the Vision's grille is smaller and, separated by its prominent center badge, has been likened to the appearance of \\"nostrils.\\" The interior of the Vision is nearly identical to the Concorde, the biggest difference being the absence of the Concorde's faux wood trim and steering wheel emblem. Unlike the Vision, the Concorde never offered the autostick option. Marketed as a sport sedan, the Vision offered only bucket seats with console, never the split bench with column shift. The Vision featured a monochromatic design inside and out, with no brand or model badge on the doors (as found on the Concorde), and available aluminum wheels with a simple design. The single color motif was more pronounced on models without the grey lower body trim paint scheme. In keeping with its high-performance image, the Vision was the only LH sedan to come standard with \\"touring\\" suspension. \\"Performance\\" suspension was an available option on the Vision. The upscale TSi model featured leather-trimmed seats, 8-way power seats for both the driver and front passenger, leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather shift knob, cloth door inserts, rear seat vents, center rear armrest, and personal reading lamps. Power windows and central door locks were standard for both trims, as were dual airbags, with remote keyless entry available as an option. Among other factory installed sound systems available, was the top-of-the-line Infinity sound system which included 8 speakers positioned throughout the cabin along with an equalizer. Head units included a radio with either cassette or CD playback, and a maximum five-bands adjustable graphic equalizer. 1993‚Äì1995 Eagle Vision with grey lower body trim Chrysler Vision The TSi model was distinguishable as it did not have a fixed mast antenna, but a retractable power antenna that stored itself inside the rear passenger-side fender. Anti-lock brakes (ABS) were standard, with traction control optional. Dual-way power sunroofs were available on this car in either trim. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof Corp. (now ASC Global) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated most of the front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), an onboard computer with integrated map lights, was retained. The Vision was generally the middle offering of the original three LH cars, with the ESi starting between a base Intrepid and a base Concorde (usually just under the Concorde by a few hundred dollars). However the TSi's base price was more than a base Concorde. Other LH cars, the New Yorker and LHS, started higher than the Vision. =Trims= *ESi - 1993‚Äì1997 *TSi - 1993‚Äì1997 Performance The Eagle Vision ESi came equipped with a 3.3 liter V6 engine initially producing 153 bhp (112 kW) and rising to in the 1994‚Äì1995 models. For 1996, it lost , but gained 9 ft¬∑lbf of torque. The TSi was factory-equipped with the more powerful SOHC 24-valve 3.5 L V6 engine producing . Both engines were joined to a 4-speed automatic. The 1996 and 1997 TSi with its 3.5 had the 4-speed autostick option featuring a unique PRNDL mechanism invented by Peter Gruich, with no option of a manual transmission. =Engines= *3.3 L V6 - Horsepower and Torque: & (1992‚Äì93), & (1994‚Äì1995) and, & (1996‚Äì1997) *3.5 L V6 - & The 3.3 liter engine was engineered to run on 87 octane gasoline, while the larger 3.5 requires mid- grade 89 octane fuel as a minimum, but benefits from premium 91 octane fuel. Year-to-year changes *1994: Variable-assist power steering was available, providing more feel at higher speeds. Both models now wore the same lower-body cladding, minimizing the evident differences between the ESi and TSi. The 3.3 L engine's power output was increased by 8 hp, while the 4-speed automatic transmission was revised for smoother shifting. *1995: New standard features included heated power exterior rear-view mirrors, power windows, and an AM/FM stereo with a cassette player. The 3.5-liter engine became available as an upgrade option for the ESi trim level. *1996: A new Autostick shifting feature became available for the TSi trim. The car could be \\"manually\\" shifted by tilting the shift knob right or left to change gears up or down. Plastic lower trim was deleted in favor of body color lower trim for a monochromatic color scheme. Pentastar logo previously present on the front fenders in front of the doors was deleted. Windshield wiper jets were moved from the wiper arms to the hood. All 1996 Eagle Visions were made OBD-II compliant. *1997: Only minor changes were made to the 1997 Vision. After this model year, the Vision was discontinued. End of the Vision The Vision sold around 105,000 units, from 1993 to 1997, and Chrysler was planning to continue it for the redesign of the LH cars for 1998. Some prototypes featured the Eagle logo, and Vision production continued into September 1997 to offer dealers with an adequate amount of 1997 models, until the introduction redesigned 1998 Vision. However, Chrysler made the decision to stop production of the Vision and Talon (Eagle's only other model by then) with the last unit built on September 5, 1997. On September 29, 1997, the automaker notified 2,340 U.S. and 337 Canadian dealers that the Eagle brand would be discontinued by the end of the 1998 model year. The car that was planned to be the redesigned Vision, became the 1999 model year Chrysler 300M. It was released a year after the other redesigned LH cars in 1998.

Following the closure of the Plymouth division in 2000, the Voyager was marketed under the Chrysler brand (as a lower-trim version of the Chrysler Town & Country), where it was sold through 2003. From 1988 to 2016, Chrysler used the Chrysler Voyager name for export-market minivans; during the existence of the Plymouth brand, export-market Voyagers were produced with the body and trim of the Dodge Caravan. When including the Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan with their rebadged Chrysler, Lancia, and Volkswagen variants, the Chrysler minivans collectively rank as the 13th best-selling automotive model line worldwide. The Plymouth Voyager minivan was assembled by Chrysler at its Windsor Assembly facility (Windsor, Ontario, Canada); from 1987 to 2000, the Voyager was also assembled at Saint Louis Assembly (Fenton, Missouri). The full-size Plymouth Voyager van was assembled at the now-closed Pillette Road Truck Assembly facility (Windsor, Ontario, Canada). Full-size van (AB; 1974-1983) For the 1974 model year, Plymouth marketed trucks under its own brand (for the first time since 1942). The Voyager was the Plymouth counterpart of the Dodge Sportsman passenger van alongside the Trail Duster SUV (a counterpart of the Dodge Ramcharger). In contrast to Dodge, the Voyager was marketed solely as a passenger van; in line with the Sportsman, 12‚Äì15 passenger seating was offered.Readers' Rides; 1974 Plymouth Voyager (Grassroots Motorsports) Early versions of the Voyager were visually similar to their Dodge counterparts, centering Plymouth badging in the grille (as with Fargo vans and 1971-1973 Dodges). For 1978, the B-pillar underwent a redesign, placing the side door further forward; the dashboard was redesigned (Dodge would use this design through 1997). Externally distinguished by a new grille, the exterior saw a shift of the Plymouth lettering from the grille to the hood. For 1979, Chrysler introduced the second generation of the B-platform vans, marked by a longer front nose (and the discontinuation of big-block V8 engines). Virtually indistinguishable from its Dodge Royal Sportsman counterpart, the parking lamps of the Voyager now wrapped into the front fenders, fitted with four rectangular headlamps. For 1981, Dodge vans adopted the \\"Ram van\\" model nameplate (in line with Dodge pickup trucks); with a lack of large \\"RAM\\" badging on the door, the Voyager saw more differentiation from its Dodge counterpart. Following the 1983 model year, Plymouth discontinued the full-size Voyager, using the nameplate for its minivan; the 1983 full-size van would be the final full-size truck offered by the brand prior to its 2001 closure. Background Lee Iacocca and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for a modern minivan during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company. Henry Ford II had rejected Iaccoca's and Sperlich's idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974, then rumored to carry the name \\"Maxivan\\". Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler Corporation, and together they created the T115 minivan ‚Äî a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known colloquially as the \\"Magic-wagons\\" (a term used in advertising). The Chrysler minivans launched a few months ahead of the Renault Espace (the first MPV/minivan in Europe, initially presented to executives as a Talbot (which was made up of Chrysler Europe's disposed assets) in 1979,The Matra/Renault Espace but not launched until 1984), making them the first of their kind ‚Äî effectively creating the modern minivan segment in the US. First generation (S; 1984‚Äì1990) 1985 Plymouth Voyager LE rear 1987-1990 Plymouth Voyager SE In 1984, Chrysler marketed the rebadged Plymouth variant of its new minivan as the Voyager, using the Chrysler's S platform, derived from the K-platform (Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries). The Voyager shared components with the K-cars including portions of the interior, e.g., the Reliant's instrument cluster and dashboard controls, along with the K-platform front-wheel drive layout and low floor, giving the Voyager a car-like ease of entry. The Voyager was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1985. For 1987, the Voyager received minor cosmetic updates as well as the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Voyager, which was built on a longer wheelbase adding more cargo room. It was available only with SE or LE trim. First-generation Voyager minivans were offered in three trim levels: an unnamed base model, mid-grade SE, and high-end LE, the latter bearing simulated woodgrain paneling. A sportier LX model was added in 1989, sharing much of its components with the Caravan ES. Safety features included 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers and lap belts for rear passengers. Standard on all Voyagers were legally mandated side-impact reinforcements for all seating front and rear outboard positions. Safety features such as airbags or ABS were not available.\\"A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan\\" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar, retrieved on 2010‚Äì08‚Äì23.

In 1985, on base and SE models, the front buckets could be replaced by a 40/60 split three-passenger bench seat, bringing the total number of occupants to six. Seven-passenger seating was an option on SEs and LEs, with dual front buckets, an intermediate two-passenger bench, and a rear three-passenger bench. Eight- passenger seating was available on SE models only, with both the additional middle two-passenger bench and three-passenger front bench. Depending on configuration, the base model could seat up to six, the SE could seat up to eight, and the LE could seat up to seven. The two bench seats in the rear were independently removable (though not foldable), and the large three-seat bench could also be installed in the 2nd row location via a second set of attachment points on the van's floor, ordinarily hidden with snap-in plastic covers. This configuration allowed for conventional five-passenger seating with a sizable cargo area in the rear. The latching mechanisms for the benches were very intuitive and easy to operate. On base models, the front buckets were low-back items, upholstered with plain cloth or vinyl. On SEs, the buyer could choose between low-back buckets with deluxe cloth or high-back buckets in upgraded vinyl. LEs came standard with high-back front buckets, upholstered in either luxury cloth or luxury vinyl. In 1985 and 1986, there was also a five- passenger version with a back seat that could be folded flat with the pull of a handle into a bed that filled the rear compartment from the back of the front seats to the rear. This option was known as the Magic Camper. The Magic Camper back seat had an extra rear-facing cushion that formed the back-most section of the bed when folded flat and the seat, though very heavy, was removable. The Magic Camper option included a tent that attached magnetically to the side of the vehicle allowing access in and out of the sliding side door. For 1987 the six- and eight-passenger options were withdrawn, leaving seating for five standard and for seven optional on the base and SE, and seating for seven with high-back front buckets standard on the LE, Grand SE, and Grand LE. Deluxe cloth upholstery was now standard on base and all SE models, with the luxury vinyl optional on SEs. On LEs, luxury cloth came standard and for the first time, leather seats were available on the LE models. =Engines= 1987-1990 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE For the first 3 years of production, two inline-4 engines with 2 barrel carburetors were offered. The base 2.2L was borrowed from the Chrysler K-cars, and produced horsepower. The higher performance fuel injected version of the 2.2L engine later offered in the Chrysler K-cars was only offered in the Voyager for the 1987 model year, and would remain the base powerplant until mid-1987. Alongside the 2.2L, an optional Mitsubishi 2.6L engine was available producing horsepower.https://www.allpar.com/model/m/original-minivans.html At launch, the Voyager's low horsepower to weight ratio had not been much of a concern. Its main competitors were the Toyota Van and the Volkswagen Vanagon, both of which offered similar performance. In mid-1987, the base 2.2L I4 was replaced with a fuel-injected 2.5L I4, which produced , while the Mitsubishi G54B I4 was replaced with the new fuel-injected 3.0L Mitsubishi V-6 producing in March of that year. A turbocharged version of the base 2.5L producing was available in 1989 and 1990. Also in 1989, revisions to the Mitsubishi V-6 upped its output to . In 1990, a new 3.3L V-6 was added to the option list. Sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled as a result, and it was dropped at the end of the year. * 1984‚Äì1987 2.2 L K I4, , * 1984‚Äì1987 2.6 L Mitsubishi G54B I4, , * 1987¬Ω‚Äì1990 2.5 L K I4, , * 1987¬Ω‚Äì1988 3.0 L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6, , * 1989‚Äì1990 2.5 L Turbo I4, , * 1989-1990 3.0 L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6, , * 1990 3.3 L EGA V6, , =Transmissions= Both a three-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission and a five-speed manual were available with all inline-four engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 L (this was a rare combination). V-6 engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated TorqueFlite, until the computer controlled Ultradrive 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The Ultradrive offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the inline-four engine. Second generation (AS; 1991‚Äì1995) 1994 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE rear 1992-1993 Plymouth Voyager The Plymouth Voyager was modified for 1991 with new sheet metal. The S platform was still used, though renamed the \\"AS platform\\". These were the last Voyagers that were derived from the Chrysler K platform. Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. 1991 Voyagers were available in base, mid-grade SE, high- end LE, and high-end sporty LX. The LX which was available only on short- wheelbase Voyagers, was marketed as a sport-luxury minivan and came with the most standard equipment including alloy wheels, fog lamps, and wide array of power-operated features.Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure \\"1991 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager\\" In later years various trim packages were offered on SE models. The \\"Sport Wagon\\" package available from 1993‚Äì1995 featured accent color (gray) bumpers and molding, fog lamps, and special aluminum wheels.\\"Used Plymouth Prices\\", retrieved on 2010‚Äì08‚Äì23. The \\"Rallye\\" package offered in 1995, took the place of the departed LX model. It was more luxury-oriented, with lower body two-tone paint ‚Äî regardless of upper body color, the lower body was painted \\"Driftwood Beige\\" ‚Äî silver aluminum wheels, and special badging. The font first used for the Rallye's badging was adopted for all of Plymouth's badging from 1996 onward.\\"1991-1995 Chrysler minivans: Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town & Country\\" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar, retrieved on 2010‚Äì08‚Äì23. Interiors were more differentiated in this generation than on the first with a redesigned dashboard for 1994 featured a passenger-side front airbag. and a seating package, marketed as \\"Quad Command\\" seating package, available on SE, LE, and LX models. Quad command replaced the 2nd row bench with two individual bucket seats with a center aisle to the 3rd row bench. Interior options varied with trim levels and packages. Cloth seating was standard on all models; leather seating was a standalone extra-cost option on LE and LX models. Only badging and minor cosmetics differentiated the Voyager from its Dodge Caravan rebadged variant. The Chrysler Town & Country shared the Voyager's headlamps and taillights along with its own chrome waterfall grille. In Mexico, the Voyager was sold as a Chrysler and shared the chrome waterfall grille with the Town & Country. =Innovations= This generation of vans brought additional innovations, including: * \\"Quad Command\\" bucket seating (1990) * Available All-wheel drive (1990) * Available anti-lock brakes (1990) * First driver's side airbag in a minivan (1991), made standard (1991), and first dual front airbags (1993) * Integrated child safety seats (1991), improved design with recliners (1993) * First minivan to meet 1998 U.S. federal safety standards (1993) The turbocharged engine and Convert-A-Bed feature were dropped. =Engines= * 1991‚Äì1995 2.5 L K I4, , * 1991‚Äì1995 3.0 L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6, , * 1991‚Äì1993 3.3 L EGA V6, , * 1994‚Äì1995 3.3 L EGA V6, , * 1994‚Äì1995 3.8 L EGH V6, , =Year-to-year changes= * 1991: Second-generation minivans released. A driver's side airbag was made standard for this year. Integrated child safety seats in the second row bench were optional on 1992 Voyagers. The Grand Voyager was available with a lower-cost powertrain. A 3.0 L V6 and a 3-speed automatic could be substituted for the standard 3.3 L V6 with its 4-speed automatic. The 5-speed manual transmission could once again be paired with the base engine, which was now the 2.5 liter four instead of the original 2.2 liter four. * 1993: On 7-passenger models, the optional \\"Quad Command\\" bucket seats replaced the middle bench seat. The right bucket tilted forward to ease entry and exit to the rearmost bench. The front shoulder belts became height-adjustable and rear shoulder belts had lower anchor points and the horn button was black. * 1994: New bumpers and body moldings, and a redesigned dashboard appeared on all 1994 Voyagers. New safety features which included a passenger-side airbag and side door-guard beams enabled the Voyager to meet all passenger car safety requirements through 1998. A cassette player became standard on all models but the base, and a CD player was available on all models. Under the hood, a 3.8 L V6 was a new option for top-of-the-line Grand Voyager LE models. The 3.3 L V6 had been upgraded to produce as well. For 1994 the \\"10 Year Anniversary Edition\\" was an option on Voyager SE models; it had unique two-tone paint and badges. * 1995: No major changes were made for 1995, except for the new Rallye option package available on SE models. Rallye models came with special silver-accent wheels and special two-toned paint on the lower body. Third generation (NS; 1996‚Äì2000) 2000 Plymouth Voyager rear 1996-2000 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE 1997 Plymouth Grand Voyager LE The 1996 Plymouth Voyager was completely redesigned from the ground up. Gone were its K-car underpinnings and architecture, replaced with more modern components and Chrysler's acclaimed cab-forward design. The third generation redesign used the Chrysler NS platform and included a driver's-side sliding door, a minivan first. The Voyager was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997.\\"1996 10Best Cars\\", retrieved on 2010‚Äì08‚Äì24.\\"1997 10Best Cars\\" , retrieved on 2010‚Äì08‚Äì24. In a shift from previous minivans, the third- generation Voyager was marketed as the entry-level Chrysler minivan rather than as a direct counterpart of the Dodge Caravan. While sharing the same bodyshell, the Voyager and Caravan saw significant changes in body trim and feature content. Distinguished by a dark gray eggcrate grille (a body-color grille became an option in 1998), the Voyager used matte gray bumpers across all trim levels with matte gray side moldings. Before calendar year 1996, the NS Voyager was produced with the Pentastar grille emblem and rear badging carried over from the previous model year, shifting to the \\"sailboat\\" Plymouth grille emblem and new badging in script font afterward. The Voyager retained the base, SE, and LE trims from its predecessor. To reduce model overlap, the LE trim was discontinued in the United States (in favor of an expanded Town & Country range). To allow the Plymouth brand to remain competitive, the Rallye option package was introduced on the SE trimChrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure \\"1996 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager\\"; along with exterior badging, the Rallye offered interior content featured in LE-trim Voyagers and Caravans. For 1998, the Rallye trim was renamed Expresso.Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure \\"1998 Plymouth Voyager\\" Third generation Voyagers and Grand Voyagers were equipped nearly identically to their Dodge counterparts, save for front fascias, badging, and the wheels on LE-trim vans, which are shared with the Town & Country. However, to maintain its position as the entry-level minivan, the Voyager was never produced with automatic headlights, fog lights, power driver's seat and power mirror memory, or auto-dimming rear view mirrors. All-wheel drive was also discontinued in some markets. The vinyl woodgrain-appearance side paneling was no longer available, as the new side sheetmetal was no longer flat. Third generation Voyagers introduced a new system of rear seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning-- marketed as \\"Easy-Out Roller Seats\\". All Voyagers and Grand Voyagers were equipped with this feature. When installed, the 2nd and 3rd row seats (either bucket or bench seats) are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lifted each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks had locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks released the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raised the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks were permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions were aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter. =Engines= * 1996‚Äì2000 2.4 L EDZ I4, , (Canadian vans beginning in 1999 included a 3.0 L V6 as standard equipment) * 1996‚Äì2000 3.0 L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6 , (not available in certain U.S. states, 3.3 L V6 offered as standard equipment in those states instead) * 1996‚Äì2000 3.3 L EGA V6, , * 1996‚Äì1997 3.8 L EGH V6, , * 1998‚Äì1999 3.8 L EGH V6, , =Year-to-year changes= * 1996: As running changes during this model year, the Pentastar front logo and rear badging carried over from the previous generation were replaced with the new \\"sailboat\\" logo and script font, while the front interior door panels were redesigned, losing the discrete grab handles in favor of ones integrated into the armrests. Another running change saw the elimination of the plastic intake manifold cover from the 3.8L engine. * 1997: A CD player was a new option. Other than that, only minimal changes. * 1998: Grocery bag hooks were added to the rearmost bench. The Rallye package was renamed Expresso and now included new wheel covers (if equipped with steel wheels), a standard CD player and a body-colored grille). SE models with optional low-back seats and LE models received updated cloth upholstery. As a running change during this model year, the HVAC vents on the driver's side and in the center of the dashboard were changed to a more conventional design. * 1999: The 3.8 L V6 was made available for front-wheel drive SE models. A small cargo net between the front seats, additional standard equipment, integrated child-safety seats and second-row buckets were added to the Voyager this year. Air conditioning was made standard on SE models. In Canada, the 3.0L V6 was made standard equipment. 1999 also saw the addition of a one-year-only 15th anniversary \\"Platinum Edition\\", to mark Caravan's 15th year of production. This package was offered on various trim levels, and included Platinum Metallic paint, and fender badges. * 2000: Now standard on all models was air conditioning, power windows, and power locks (the latter two standard on SE models only). A dealer-installed rear-seat video entertainment system was newly available on all models. The 2000 model year offered packages which included the \\"2000+\\" and \\"Millennium\\" package; however these were little more than unique fender badges on vans with popular equipment. As Chrysler withdrew the Plymouth brand, the Voyager was marketed by both Chrysler and Plymouth during this model year. 2000 Chrysler Voyager =Crash test results= The 1996-2000 Dodge Grand Caravan (twin of the Voyager/Grand Voyager) received a \\"Marginal\\" rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's 40 mph offset test. The structural performance and restraints were graded \\"Acceptable\\", but the foot injuries were very high. In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard. Discontinuation '02-'03 Chrysler Voyager Following the retirement of the Plymouth brand after the 2000 model year, the Voyager nameplate was continued by the Chrysler division. While used by all exported Chrysler minivans since 1988, in North America, the Chrysler Voyager served as the lowest-trim Chrysler-brand minivan. Offered only in a short-wheelbase configuration, the Voyager continued with matte-black bumpers and exterior trim. Following the 2001 introduction of the RS-generation minivans, the Voyager was distinguished by a winged Chrysler emblem atop a black plastic grille (a shape adopted by the later PT Cruiser). For 2004, Chrysler discontinued the Voyager in the United States and Canada, replacing the model line by the Dodge Caravan and a short- wheelbase Town & Country (the Voyager remained in Mexico through 2007). In markets outside of North America, the nameplate remained in use through 2016 for all export versions (as both a Chrysler and a Lancia). After skipping the 2008-2020 fifth generation, the Voyager nameplate returned to use in North America for 2020 production, slotted below the Chrysler Pacifica and effectively replacing the Dodge Grand Caravan.

It assumed the C-body Chrysler New Yorker Salon's position as the entry-level full-size sedan in the Chrysler brand lineup. One of Chrysler's three original Chrysler LH platform models, it used revolutionary cab forward design. The Concorde was related to the Chrysler/Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, Chrysler 300M, Chrysler LHS, and the eleventh and final generation Chrysler New Yorker. It was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1993 and 1994.  Design background  The Concorde's design can be traced to 1986, when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage. Also at this time, the Chrysler Corporation purchased bankrupt Italian sports car manufacturer Lamborghini. The Navajo's exterior design was reworked and became the Lamborghini Portofino, released as a concept at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler's decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino's revolutionary exterior design, called \\"cab-forward\\". The cab forward design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a much larger passenger cabin compared to its contemporary cars. Design of the chassis began in the late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought another automaker, American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker, as well as a potential Plymouth. The initial design of Dodge's LH bore resemblance to the Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after Fran√ßois Castaing, formerly AMC's Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988. The new design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the Eagle Premier, also sold later as the Dodge Monaco. The Premier's longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or rear-wheel drive (designated \\"LH\\" and \\"LX\\" respectively). The transmission was inspired by the Premier's Audi and ZF automatics. Borrowing heavily from Chrysler's A604 (41TE) \\"Ultradrive\\" transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE). The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler prototypes: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and the 1990 Eagle Optima. By 1990, it was decided that the new technologically advanced car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3 L pushrod V6. The 3.3 L engine's 60¬∞ block was bored out to 3.5 L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with SOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5 L V6. The appearance, still based on the cab forward exterior design of the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino concept, with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. This sleek styling gives the Concorde a low drag coefficient which was ahead of its time. Although American Motors' Eagle Premier (and Dodge Monaco) was discontinued by Chrysler after the 1992 model year, the new Concorde's packaging was derived from the Premier, and all the suspension and drivetrain development mules were Premiers. Other design features found their way into the Chrysler LH platform, most notably the longitudinal engine layout, a hallmark of Renault's front-wheel-drive designs. This design allowed engineers to lower the hoodline, made maintenance/servicing simpler, and tightened the car's turning diameter.  First generation (1993‚Äì1997)  The first generation of the Concorde debuted at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as a 1993 model. It debuted as a single, well-equipped model with a base price of US$18,341. First generation featured full width taillamp design Out of all the LH sedans, the first generation Concorde was most closely related to the Eagle Vision. The Concorde was given a more traditional image than the Vision. The two shared nearly all sheetmetal in common with the main differences limited to their grilles, rear fascias, body side moldings, and wheel choices. The Concorde featured a modern take on Chrysler's signature waterfall grille. It was split into six sections divided by body colored strips with the Chrysler Pentastar logo on the center strip. The Concorde's rear fascia was highlighted by a full-width and full-height lightbar between the taillights, giving the appearance that the taillights stretched across the entire trunk. In keeping with its upscale position, Concorde's body side moldings incorporated bright chrome (later golden colored) work not found on its Dodge or Eagle siblings. On Concordes with gray lower body paint color, the gray came all the way up to the chrome beltline; on Visions the gray lower body paint area was smaller and much more subtle. Wheel styles, which included available aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design, were also unique to the Chrysler LH sedans (Concorde, LHS, New Yorker); Dodge and Eagle had their own different wheel styles. The similar Eagle Vision, featured a smaller split-grill with a large Eagle badge in the center. The Vision's taillights, although the same shape as the Concorde's were clustered differently and featured European-inspired amber turn signals. The Vision did not share the Concorde's lightbar, instead using the area as space for a trunk-mounted license plate (as opposed to rear bumper-mounted license plate on the Concorde). On the other hand, the Intrepid incorporated different headlight and taillight assemblies, and had no grille at all. The interior of the Concorde was also nearly identical to that the Vision, the main difference being the Concorde's faux wood trim and steering wheel emblem; the Intrepid's interior was substantially different from the Concorde and Vision. Concordes and Intrepids could be equipped with a front bench seat and column shifter, bringing total capacity to six. The Vision could only be equipped with front bucket seats. Unlike its Dodge and Eagle siblings, Chrysler Concordes never had the option of autostick transmission and its special instrument cluster. It was only available with an automatic transmission. The upscale Concorde models featured leather-trimmed seats, steering wheels, shift knobs and door inserts. Other interior options included rear seat vents (in the five-seater), rear center rear armrest, and eight-way power seats for both the driver and passenger, as well as personal reading lamps. Power windows and central door locks were standard on all Concordes, as were dual airbags. Other options included remote keyless system and a choice of several Infinity sound systems with CD, cassette with up to eight speakers and an equalizer. The upscale LXi model was distinguishable as it did not have a retractable antenna, but a fixed antenna inside the rear passenger-side fender. Anti-lock brakes (ABS) were standard, with traction control optional. Dual-way power sunroofs were available on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof (now American Specialty Cars) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated most of the front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or on- board computer with integrated map lights, was retained. A notable achievement included the Center for Auto Safety ranking the 1993 Concorde as superior in crashworthiness after testing it at into a wall. = Model year changes = * 1993: Base 3.3 L engine had and standard non-touring suspension. A six-disc trunk-mounted Mopar CD changer with wire remote and an alarm system were dealer installed options. This was the first car, along with Intrepid and Vision, to have the 3.5 L 24-valve SOHC V6. A Panasonic cell phone with externally mounted antenna could be ordered. The split bench seat with column shift lever was not yet available, but planned from the beginning. * 1994: For this year, the touring suspension became standard. Also, base engines gained . A front split bench seat with twofold-down arm rests with cup holders and column shift became available to make it a six-seater. Power steering added more assist, to reduce turning effort for parking but delivered greater feel at higher speeds. The 3.3 L engine had from 1992 to 1993 and in the remaining years of the first generation. Both 3.3 L engines were rated at 18/21/26 MPG. Chrysler's Visorphone is offered as well as a more conventional dealer installed Chrysler car phone and the same Panasonic cell phone from 1992 launch, all shown in the 1994 model year brochure. * 1995: Improvements made to the transaxle, a modification to the optional remote keyless entry system and the addition of 'thumb-touch' acceleration and cancel features, placed on the steering wheel spokes, to the cruise control. Later 1995 models were produced with sheet metal front fenders, which replaced the composite fenders on earlier models to improve structural integrity. The corporate \\"Pentastar\\" logo was replaced by the Chrysler wreath on the grille, horn pad, and various other places (except the keyless entry key fob and keys, which still had the old \\"Pentastar\\" logo). Chrysler waited until 1995 for this change on its other models with the exception of the Cirrus and Sebring, with the Plymouth brand getting a related new logo on all 1996 and later models. Dodge had already begun phasing out the Pentastar in 1992. * 1996: The Concorde gained two distinguished trim levels for 1996: lower-level LX and higher-level LXi. Extra sound insulation and revised structural engineering promised to make the Concorde quieter. Sheet metal front fenders added for 1996 and later on all models as part of the structural upgrade. * 1997: The only major change for this year was that on the base LX model, the 3.3 L V6 was dropped as the standard engine. All of the first-generation 3.5 L engines were rated at with 16/24 city/hwy mpg and called for 89 octane fuel.  Second generation (1998‚Äì2004)  1998-2002 Chrysler Concorde Rear View Chrysler Concorde LXi The Concorde was completely redesigned for the 1998 model year. The \\"Second Generation\\" design was introduced in 1996 as the Chrysler LHX concept car. This concept vehicle had large, 20-inch wheels, a centrally located instrument cluster, and a closed-circuit television system within the windshield pillars replacing conventional rear view mirrors. The wheelbase was expanded to to allow for rear passenger supplement restraints, rear occupant entertainment center and storage compartment. Despite overall length increasing by , the second generation's weight dropped by nearly a hundred pounds. This was achieved by extensive use of aluminum for the rear suspension, hood, as well as in the two new engines. In addition the 3.5 L V6 engine, there was also a new 2.7-liter V6 and 3.2 L V6. The 3.5 L was redone and output upgraded to and was available on the 2002‚Äì2004 Concorde Limited (formerly LHS). Facelift (2002-2004) Much was done in the design process to make the second generation LH sedans look more distinct from each other. The 1998 Concorde differed far greater from the Dodge Intrepid and the new 1999 Chrysler 300M (successor to the Eagle Vision), than did the first generation models. With the exception of the doors and roof, the Concorde shared little sheetmetal with the Intrepid and 300M. The new Concorde's front end was underscored by a striking full- width grille, relocated to the front bumper to give the impression of a bottom breather. Sweeping curves and a more rounded front end also helped set the Concorde apart from the Intrepid and 300M. As in the previous generation, six passenger seating with a front bench seat and column shifter was optional.\\"2001 Chrysler Concorde\\" Kelly Blue Book, retrieved on 29 April 2010. Cloth seating was standard on base LX with leather seating optional. Leather was standard on upscale LXi and later Limited models. The Concorde, 300M, and Intrepid were discontinued in 2004. The all-new, rear-wheel-drive Chrysler 300 replaced the Concorde (and 300M) in late 2004 as a 2005 model. = Model year changes = * 1998: The Concorde was completely redesigned for the 1998 model year. Body shells were designed to be stronger and stiffer, as well as incorporating double-shear suspension mounts and integrated side impact protection. * 1999: The Concorde's suspension system was softened to enhance ride comfort and reduce road noise. Thicker carpeting was installed inside, and a new standard cargo net went into the trunk. LXi models added a new CD player and Chrysler's Sentry Key theft-deterrent system, which disabled the ignition unless the proper key was used to start the engine. * 2000: A new factory-installed power sunroof was available on both base LX and upscale LXi models. The Concorde also earned additional suspension changes designed to provide a quieter, smoother ride. Tires grew to 16 inches for the LX, to match those of the LXi. The LXi edition gained standard speed-sensitive, variable- assist steering, as well as an optional 4-disc in-dash CD changer. * 2001: Optional front side airbags and a 3-point safety belt for the rear seat's middle position were added. The LX's 22D option package now included alloy wheels. Also, the LXi's optional Infinity sound system gained steering wheel- mounted controls. * 2002: Adopting the body of the discontinued LHS, a new trim level was added, the range-topping Limited, which featured 17-inch wheels and a \\"high output\\" 3.5 L V6 with . With the former LHS's shorter nose, the 2002‚Äì2004 Concorde was shorter than 1998‚Äì2001 models. At midyear, Limited models got an optional Pro-Am Edition Group that included two-tone leather upholstery, unique interior trim, matching chrome-rimmed spare tire, a set of Taylor Made golf clubs (irons only), a special leather/suede Chrysler golf bag, exterior 'Pro-Am' appliques on the exterior rear windows, and a 'Pro-Am' trunk organizer for holding the clubs and accessories. * 2003: No major changes were made except the optional 4-disc in-dash CD changer was replaced with the optional 6-disc in-dash CD changer. * 2004: The Concorde's last year. For 2005, the Concorde was replaced by the Chrysler 300. The last Concorde was produced on August 30, 2003.

New York: Columbia University Press. short story and travel journal. History The term \\"haibun\\" was first used by the 17th- century Japanese poet Matsuo Bash≈ç, in a letter to his disciple Kyorai in 1690.Shirane, Haruo. Traces of Dreams: Landscape, Cultural Memory, and the Poetry of Bash≈ç. Stanford University Press, 1998. . p212 Bash≈ç was a prominent early writer of haibun, then a new genre combining classical prototypes, Chinese prose genres and vernacular subject matter and language. He wrote some haibun as travel accounts during his various journeys, the most famous of which is Oku no Hosomichi (Narrow Road to the Interior). Bash≈ç's shorter haibun include compositions devoted to travel and others focusing on character sketches, landscape scenes, anecdotal vignettes and occasional writings written to honor a specific patron or event. His Hut of the Phantom Dwelling can be classified as an essay while, in Saga Nikki (Saga Diary), he documents his day-to-day activities with his disciples on a summer retreat. Traditional haibun typically took the form of a short description of a place, person or object, or a diary of a journey or other series of events in the poet's life.

Characteristics A haibun may record a scene, or a special moment, in a highly descriptive and objective manner or may occupy a wholly fictional or dream-like space. The accompanying haiku may have a direct or subtle relationship with the prose and encompass or hint at the gist of what is recorded in the prose sections.

This model was manufactured in the brand-new Brampton Assembly in Canada. Chrysler Corporation bought the rights to the Premier when it acquired Renault's outstanding shares in AMC in 1987, and began selling the car under the new Eagle marque. The four-door sedan was manufactured from September 1987 (for the 1988 model year) until December 1991 (for the 1992 model year). A rebadged variant was also marketed as the Dodge Monaco from 1990 to 1992. Design In 1982 American Motors and Renault, a major shareholder in AMC since 1979, began work on a new downsized full-size front-drive passenger car, code named X-58, for introduction in late 1986. A companion two-door coupe, code named X-59, was to debut for the 1988 model year. These two body styles were to be the first full-size cars sold by AMC since the 1978 AMC Matador in order to re-position the automaker with a broader product offering in the marketplace. Rather than engineer a completely new chassis for the Premier the then-new Renault 25's monocoque underpinnings were used as a basis and adapted for the new product. Using the Renault 25 chassis the suspension was derived from the Renault Medallion (Renault 21). The suspension featured a four-wheel independent system with MacPherson struts at the front wheels and two torsion bars at each rear wheel, with stabilizer bars in both front and rear. The exterior by Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign was picked over other concepts generated by AMC's own styling department and other independent firms. The Premier's body's drag coefficient of 0.31 is slightly lower than the 1986 Ford Taurus that was well known for its aerodynamic shape. The Premier's body was finished using a baked enamel clearcoat for all the available colors. The body was covered by a 7-year, warranty. The car's trunk capacity was also large, offering of cargo space. The Eagle also featured new technology to improve luminous efficiency of its headlamp system, afford greater styling freedom, and having a rectangular frontal aspect. The 1988 Eagle Premier was one of the first cars featuring Valeo headlamps with nonparabolic, complex-surface reflector headlamps with optic lenses. Stretched in all dimensions, the Premier provided more interior room than any of its contemporaries. The interior was an all-new design by AMC's in-house staff under the direction of Dick Teague. It also included features that were considered unique at the time. The instrument panel featured \\"a heavy dose of electronics\\", with all driver controls housed within a fingertip distance from the steering wheel. It used an unusual dash mounted gear selector with a thin metal lever at the end of which was a grip handle; instead if the gear selector shifting downward in the traditional fashion, the lever dropped into the dash pod in which it was mounted. The climate controls used an unusual up-down button that cycled through the different heating modes, indicated by an array of lights. All of these controls were housed in a control panel on the right side of the steering column. On the left side of the column another control contained the light and windshield wiper controls. The turn signal control was also electronic returning to its centered position immediately after a driver signaled a turn, and a gong indicated its cancellation after completing a turn. The optional cruise control was built into the leather-wrapped steering wheel. Other features included intermittent wipers, as well as automatic variable-speed that adjusted wiper speed to the amount of water that hit the windshield; with less moisture, the slower they would move, but increasing their action if a passing truck splashed the windshield with a large amount of water. Standard on all Premiers was an electronically tuned stereo sound system. There was a choice of two powertrains. Eschewing the Renault 25's French-built four-cylinder engines, the base Premier LX trim featured a standard 2.5 L AMC four-cylinder engine. Featuring electronically controlled throttle-body fuel injection, it developed a peak power output of and of torque at 1400 rpm. This engine was coupled to a new electronically controlled four-speed automatic gearbox, developed by ZF Friedrichshafen. Fuel economy for the base model was EPA estimated at in the city and on the highway, giving it a cruising range with the gas tank. Optional in the LX and standard in ES models was a 3.0 L version of the Peugeot-Renault-Volvo (PRV) V6 engine, fitted with multiple port fuel injection, producing peak power and torque figures of at 5000 rpm and at 3570 rpm. Fuel efficiency of the V6 was rated at for the city and on the highway. Factory acceleration estimates from standstill to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) were 11.5 seconds with the four- cylinder, and 10 seconds with the six. The Premier's powertrains were covered by a 7-year, warranty, which was longer than offered by any of the competitors at the time. Developed by AMC, which was \\"the Big Three's little sister ... with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy\\", Bob Lutz, then a Vice President at Chrysler, wrote that the Premier sedan as one of the \\"impressive succession of new products\\" that Chrysler gained from acquiring the small automaker. The Eagle Premier replaced the so-called \\"Liberty car\\" that Chrysler had been developing as the basis of its future cars for many years, but was experiencing problems with this major project. The Eagle Premier was described as \\"a world class car\\" by automotive journalists, in addition to its international origins with an Italian design and Canadian assembly. \\"Considered by some the most sophisticated car in Chrysler's lineup\\", the Eagle Premier offers an \\"incredible 122 cubic feet of interior room; almost unheard of for a mid-sized passenger car\\" along with \\"European handling\\". The Premier was \\"final offspring of the AMC-Renault marriage\\" and the new car entered the marketplace \\"well endowed in just about every department. It has the most powerful conventional engines in its field, state- of-the-art electronics with a first-ever feature, and is made in the newest assembly plant in the world.\\"  Model years  Eagle Premier = 1988 = The Eagle Premier was launched in January 1988, with the first production models rolling off the assembly line on September 28, 1987. Although the car is sometimes referred to as a Renault Premier, this car was never marketed anywhere in the world as a Renault. Pre-production prototypes left the factory with Renault emblems on its grille and wheel covers. but Eagle nameplates on its trunk lid, and the Eagle division had to indicate this difference in its dealer information brochures and videos. Prior to its January 1988 launch, all pre-production cars had the Renault emblem removed from the grille and steering column horn hub pad. Depending on which stereo system was ordered, one would find either a Renault or Eagle emblem in the car through 1989 on the stereo. It was to have been the first bodystyle in a series of three, along with a four-door wagon and a two-door coupe. After Chrysler purchased Renault's stake (46%) in AMC and all other outstanding stock (54%), the wagon and coupe body styles were cancelled as was a planned Premier DL model featuring a five-speed manual gearbox. The interior of the LX featured standard six-passenger seating, with reclining 55/45 split front bench seats along with a rear seat that included a fold-down center armrest. Map pockets were standard in the front seat backs. The standard four-speed automatic transmissions were operated using a column shifter. The ES models included lower body side cladding, a firmer suspension and larger \\"touring\\" tires, as well as individual front bucket seats with adjustable see-through headrests and a full-length console with center armrest. The ES models had seating for five adults. The front bucket seats were optional in the LX, and a console- mounted gear shift was optional in both the LX and ES. = 1989 = The second model year the Premier saw almost no other changes except for the addition of cruise control and the mid-year introduction of an ES Limited model featuring monochromatic paint and body colored trim. The \\"sporty\\" two-door companion model that was announced by Iacocca for this model year to \\"get the Eagle soaring\\" with new products and a \\"brand personality that's unique ... and exciting ... and upscale\\" was not released. = 1990 = badge engineered variant In 1990 the Premier was substantially reengineered. Standard were 4-wheel disc brakes and a stainless steel exhaust system. The electrical system was replaced with standard Chrysler parts that proved to be more reliable than the original Renix system. The exterior was changed slightly, the Design Giugiaro badges being removed from the front fenders as a result. The (unpopular) four-cylinder engine was officially dropped from the lineup, with the V6 remaining as the sole engine. A badge engineered version of the Premier was added using a familiar Chrysler name, the Dodge Monaco, a moniker that was first used by Dodge in 1965 and last used in 1978 on a full-size, rear-drive sedan. Because of its design \\"as up-to-date as anything in the mid- sized market\\" the Premier now became the foundation for Chrysler's next generation of automobiles. = 1991 = Eagle Premier interior The 1991 model year had little news for the Premier except for a new anti-lock braking system (ABS) that was also available on the Canadian-built Dodge Monaco twin. The new safety feature came standard on the ES Limited and was optional on other models. The Limited model received a new front grille and rear tail lamp assemblies. The marketplace saw a downturn and all automakers began offering incentives to move inventory. At the beginning of the year, supplies of the Eagle Premier climbed up to 222 days and Chrysler gave a $1,000 discount to dealers on the invoice price, a $1,500 rebate to purchasers, and a $2,000 incentive to the dealer per car after their fourth sale. An ES Limited model listing for $19,978 was only $15,478 after the marketing incentives. By the end of the year, Jeep-Eagle dealers had low inventories of Premiers ‚Äì with only 28 days supply ‚Äì compared to 119 days for overstocked cars such as the Chevrolet Caprice. = 1992 = The Eagle Premier and its badge engineered variant, the Dodge Monaco, continued basically unchanged for 1992, except every model received the grille and tail lamps that were only on the Limited in 1991. Chrysler also announced it would be the Premier's final year as the automaker prepared to launch all its new LH models in the Bramalea assembly plant. Bramalea ended Dodge Monaco and Eagle Premier output on December 17, 1991. Legacy The Eagle brand targeted consumers that would not typically include purchasing an American sedan, \\"but would have instead sought out a Volvo or an Audi.\\" The \\"upscale\\" Premier was the flagship of the new Eagle division at Chrysler and in the same class \\"as cars like the Audi 5000, ... roomy, understated and elegantly turned out.\\" Popular Science, in a four-car road test, considered the Premier one of the sportiest sedans (by measure of road holding and drive precision) available on the American market. The fully independent suspension on all the wheels made for better ride quality and handling characteristics, as did the rack and pinion steering design. \\"The Premier was for its size, the lightest car that Chrysler built at the time [with a shipping weight of ], the stiffest (torsionally), and the best riding almost of wheel travel vs. 4.5 for the K-cars that underpinned every Chrysler car then available. It benefited from decades of Renault experience with front-wheel-drive, and a good example will still impress even today.\\" The engineering levels achieved in the Premier are arguably the most refined in a sedan that was then produced by AMC or Chrysler. The original projections were to have annual production of 150,000 Premiers. Magna International had signed a contract in 1986 to supply body panels for the Premiers. As a result, the automotive supplier received $10 million grants from the governments of both Canada and Ontario to expand the metal stamping plant in Milton, Ontario. However, the Premier did not achieve its sales targets, with calendar year production for 1989 only reaching 32,720 examples. Critics have argued that Chrysler did not properly market the Premier, having confused its intended market. ES models were compared directly with the Audi 80, Acura Legend, and similar ‚Äòimport‚Äô sedans, while LX models were aimed at a lower tier market competing against the Ford Taurus and GM A-platform cars (Buick Century, Chevrolet Celebrity, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera). Chrysler also ended up with six different brands after the purchase of AMC, just one less than GM, which was four times as large automaker. Not only could Chrysler not afford to properly promote and advertise each of its brands, it also faced the legacy of failure by French cars in the United States. The Premier carried many vestiges of AMC and Renault's engineering long after Chrysler acquired the car's design. For example, the vehicle identification number for the entire 1988 model year production retained AMC format. The AMC logo was featured on many of the car's components through to the end of production. The introduction of a rebadged model named Dodge Monaco resulted from a contractual obligation to use 260,000 of the PRV engines over five years, a clause in the AMC buyout from Renault. The Monaco sold poorly, and both it and the Premier were cancelled in 1992. There was little marketing support for the Premier by the Jeep-Eagle dealers themselves because they were focused on selling the highly successful and more profitable Jeep models. Furthermore, the decision to eventually combine Jeep-Eagle with Chrysler-Plymouth dealers called for the long-term corporate goal of phasing out the Eagle brand. There were 139,051 Premiers and Monacos built at Bramalea. Chrysler paid a penalty for every car not produced and V6 engine not purchased from Renault. A new, \\"highly advanced\\" factory (called Bramalea Assembly) was built to manufacture the Premier at Bramalea. This was near an existing AMC plant in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. This state of the art plant was opened in 1986 and was one of AMC's assets that interested Chrysler. It was renamed Brampton Assembly after the buyout. Brampton Assembly was retooled for the production of the Chrysler LH- cars that debuted in autumn of 1992, including the Premier's replacement, the Vision, and the Vision's sister vehicles, the Dodge Intrepid and the Chrysler Concorde. The Premier inspired many of the LH platform‚Äôs design features. Fran√ßois Castaing, formerly AMC's Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988, and as a result, the Premier was the starting point for Chrysler's new LH sedans. Although the cab forward styling was quite different, the engines in the LH cars were mounted longitudinally, like the Premier. This was \\"a hallmark of Renault's front-wheel-drive designs\\" and unlike any other car built by Chrysler to that time. The LH platform's dedicated transmission, the A606, was also quite similar in design to the electronically controlled automatic featured in four-cylinder Premiers. The Premier's body shell was used for LH prototype development mules, under which the LH drivetrain was tested. Although only a four-door sedan, the Premier could be a \\"future classic\\" according to automotive journalist, Dan Roth, as \\"one of the best American cars of the last 20 years, able to hold its own against luxury European marques, and being a caretaker of the last AMC car (Jeeps aren't cars!) would be a responsibility we'd relish.\\" Gallery File:EaglePremier1.jpg1988 Eagle Premier exterior File:EaglePremier2.jpg File:EaglePremier3.jpg File:EaglePremier4.jpg1988 Eagle Premier interior Notes External links * Eagle Premier - The Accidental Dodge at Allpar provides detailed information about the Premier * Derek Dorroh's tribute to the Eagle Premier * Online club for Eagle Premier & 90-92 Dodge Monaco owners * Premier Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Full-size vehicles Premier Category:Sedans Category:1980s cars Category:1990s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1987 ","title":"Eagle Premier"},{"id":"863477","text":"John Cunningham , (22 October 1890 - 16 April 1917) was a British soldier during the First World War, an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

The Eagle Vision filled the \\"import-fighter\\" segment and its second-generation replacement was benchmarked against the BMW 5 Series. However, the entire Eagle line was dropped by Chrysler. The automaker brought back the \\"300\\" model name, although the cars were not rear- wheel-drive, nor did they have engines rated at 300 horsepower as did the historic models. It also didn't feature the traditional \\"cross-hair\\" grille of previous 300 models, as by the mid-1980s it had been adopted by sister division Dodge for its entire model line. Had the Eagle brand not been dropped, the 300M would instead be sold as a redesigned Vision. Test cars, factory manuals, and design images were prepared for the second-generation Vision featuring a prominent Eagle badge on the grille. The 300M was similar in exterior and almost identical in the interior as the Concorde. The 300M also fit the European \\"5-metre\\" (16.4 ft) size class for exports to Europe, unlike the substantially similar, yet larger Chrysler LHS. It had the same wheelbase as the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and pre-2002 Chrysler Concorde, reducing its length by cutting front and rear overhangs. Powertrain Only one engine was available, the Chrysler-engineered 3.5 L V6, initially created for first-generation LH vehicles and revamped for the newer LH line. It was shared with the Plymouth Prowler and a limited edition R/T variant of the second-generation Dodge Intrepid. The engine was shared with the LHS and rebadged Concorde (2002‚Äì2004). For 1999, it was rated at , and of torque. It was connected to the 42LE, a four-speed automatic transmission with Autostick, which allowed manual selection of gears. Standard gear ratio on the 300M was 3.66:1. Year-to-year changes Chrysler 300M Special In 1999, automatic headlamps were added, and the Handling Group removed the speed limiter. In 2000, an interlock was added to prevent shifting the transmission from Park unless the brake pedal was pressed; and tether anchors were added to the rear shelf for child seats. The 2001 model year brought more changes, with an optional luxury group that included an automatic dimming driver-side mirror and supplemental side airbags. A more advanced EVIC (trip computer) was made optional. The 300M also received new jeweled taillights. In 2002, electronic brake distribution was added to the antilock brakes; a new computer combined engine and transmission controls; latch tethers were now built-in; and \\"natural\\" evaporative emission monitoring was added. The 300M Special was offered beginning midyear 2002. It featured a 3.5 liter engine designed to use premium (91+ octane) gasoline and producing of torque, with a 3.89 final drive ratio. Performance-type dual exhaust, high-performance brakes, and 18-inch Z-rated tires were standard, with Michelin Pilot Sport 245/45R18 performance tires optional. Other standard features of the Special included premium \\"Waterfall\\" leather seats, signal mirrors, body cladding, and slightly lower ride height. This model also included high-intensity discharge headlamps and imitation-carbon-fiber interior trim panels that replaced the standard woodgrain trim panels. A limited number of 300M \\"Pro-Am\\" models were marketed during 2002. These versions included an Infinity audio system with subwoofers as well as two-toned leather interiors. The Pro-Am also came with a set of limited edition golf clubs and a holder for a golf bag in the trunk. In 2003, new colors were added, a six-disc CD changer replaced the four-disc changer, and the changer controls were added to the stereo. 2004 brought optional Sirius Satellite Radio and an optional stereo with DVD-based GPS navigation. For the 2004 model year, Chrysler offered the Platinum Series 300M to coincide with the company's 20th anniversary of Chrysler's original minivan (Dodge Caravan/Chrysler Town & County/Plymouth Voyager). In addition to the 300M, five other vehicles were offered as Platinum Series: the Sebring Convertible, PT Cruiser, Sebring Sedan, Sebring Coupe, and Town & Country. The Platinum Series 300M was available only in three exterior colors: Graphite Metallic, Bright Silver Metallic, or Brilliant Black Crystal. Other features included: deep slate/light taupe two-tone interior, chrome door handles, deep gloss black turn signal mirrors with a reverse gear auto pivot feature, and 17-inch chrome wheels. A 360-watt Infinity II Cassette/CD player, and a no-charge SIRIUS satellite radio system with a one-year SIRIUS subscription were also included. Additional features include leather seats, satin silver bezels, chrome or platinum clad wheels, and other unique interior features. These models have a special Platinum Series badging on the C pillars. For 2005, both the 300M and the Concorde were replaced with the Chrysler 300. Awards The 300M was Motor Trend magazine's Car of the Year for 1999. It also was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1999 and 2000.

Incorporated in 1976, the garden's mission is to \\"develop and maintain plant collections for the purposes of display, education, conservation, research and enjoyment.\\"Atlanta Botanical Garden Website, Mission and History page, Atlantabg.org, Retrieved 2008-08-27 History Atlanta Botanical Garden welcome center Following a petition by citizens of Atlanta in the year 1973, the garden was incorporated in 1976, as the private, 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation Atlanta Botanical Garden Inc.. The garden incorporated the pre- existing Dr. A. Leslie Stephens Memorial Bonsai Garden, now known as the Japanese Garden. Within a year Bill Warner, previously employed at Holden Arboretum, was assigned office as the first executive director. He was soon followed by Ann L. Crammond in 1979. The following year marked a turning point in the history of the garden as a 50-year lease was negotiated with the city, securing the site of the Garden for years to come. A number of promotional activities started taking place, including social events, major art exhibitions and the annual Garden of Eden Ball. The Atlanta Botanical Garden welcomed its 50,000th visitor within a mere three years after the lease was arranged - this was even before any permanent structures had been erected. In 1985, the Atlanta Botanical Garden built its first permanent structure, the Gardenhouse. Expansions following this were The Children's Garden (1999), the Fuqua Conservatory in 1989, and the Fuqua Orchid Center which was added in 2002. Blockbuster summertime exhibitions began in 2003 with TREEmendous TREEhouses. Chihuly in the Garden opened in 2004, while in 2005 Locomotion in the Garden featured G-scale model trains. On April 29, 2006, an exhibition of the sculpture of Niki de Saint Phalle opened to the public. These huge mosaic sculptures came to the Garden from France, Germany, and California. In 2007, the exhibition was David Rogers' Big Bugs and Killer Plants, and 2008 is Sculpture in Motion, Art Choreographed by Nature, a display of moving, kinetic art. In 2009, the Garden hosted an exhibition of the monumental bronze sculptures of Henry Moore. The summers of 2010 and 2011 showcased the Garden's green expansion (see below), and in 2012, the Garden hosted Independent Visions, an exhibition of contemporary sculptures by nine artists. In 2013, the Garden will unveil Imaginary Worlds: Plants Larger than Life, made up of 19 mosaic culture sculptures. In 2016, Chihuly in the Garden open again with 19 installations throughout the Garden. In the winter the Garden has a holiday light show. \\"Garden Lights, Holiday Nights\\" began in 2011 featuring displays created with more than 1 million lights, most of them LED. The following year, the show grew to more than 1.5 million lights and attracted more than 160,000 visitors. Chihuly in the Garden Exhibition In 2004, the Atlanta Botanical Garden hosted an exhibition of glass art by Dale Chihuly titled \\"Chihuly in the Garden\\". The exhibit ran through the end of October and was extended until December 31, 2004. During the eight-month run, an estimated 425,000 attendees visited the exhibit. The peak per-day rates of 7,500 were double the previous single-day attendance record at the Garden. Chihuly in the Garden returned to the Atlanta location on April 30, 2016 with 19 new installations.

The expansion plan encompassed the construction of a number of new facilities, the most noticeable of which are the new visitor center and canopy walk. The plan was built around five key areas of human and environmental health: sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality. By employing an array of energy-saving strategies with environmental sustainability considered throughout the project and recycling any trees removed as a result of construction, considerable efforts were made to make this expansion eco-friendly. A 100,000-gallon cistern was installed underground in December 2007 to aid in water conservation; the cistern fills with only an inch and a quarter of rain and waters about 40% of the new gardens. One striking feature of the new visitor center is the innovative green roof, with plants covering nearly 50% of the roof area. It provides natural cooling, sound insulation and additional garden area for visitors, and even a new wildlife habitat. The visitor center leads visitors to the canopy walk. The garden's old parking lot is now a beautiful Edible Garden featuring an outdoor kitchen; this new garden reconnects people with food and healthful eating. And the final aspect of the garden expansion plan is the conversion of its old entry drive to a large cascades garden filled with tropical plants and gently flowing waterfalls. Canopy Walk Canopy Walk The Atlanta Botanical Garden is home to the Kendeda Canopy Walk, a skywalk that allows the visitors to tour one of the city's last remaining urban forests from around 40 feet in the air through the treetops of the Storza Woods. The skywalk extends from a bluff in the Garden into the branches of oaks, hickories and poplars. The structure also provides an aerial view of the woodland garden below. Atlanta Botanical Garden canopy walk The Canopy Walk was built for $55 million and opened in 2010. It was originally set to open in 2009, but during its construction in 2008, the skywalk collapsed, killing one worker and injuring 18 others.Cook, Rhonda (2010 December 09). Another lawsuit filed in 2008 collapse of Botanical Gardens Canopy Walk, Ajc.comGumbrecht, Jamie (2010 February 11).PHOTO: Botanical Garden walkway construction continues Because of the uniqueness of the Canopy Walk, city leaders believe it will become an icon for Atlanta. Exhibits The Botanical Garden is composed of a number of smaller themed gardens. Each contains different landscapes to display a variety of plants. Near the entrance are formal gardens, such as the Japanese garden and the rose garden. Two woodland areas, the Upper Woodland and the Storza Woods feature large trees and shade-loving flowers and undergrowth. The Children's Garden features whimsical sculptures, fountains, and interpretive exhibits on botany, ecology, and nutrition. The Dorothy Chapman Fuqua Conservatory contains indoor exhibits of plants from tropical rainforests and deserts. The rain forest room of the Fuqua Conservatory is also populated by tropical birds, turtles, and several exhibits of poison dart frogs, the last of which is a collaboration in conservation efforts with Zoo Atlanta. Adjoining this building, the Fuqua Orchid Center contains separate rooms simulating the tropics and high elevations in order to house rare orchids from around the world. The Fuqua Orchid Center is home to the largest collection of species orchids on permanent display in the U.S. and hosts a wintertime display known as Orchid Daze. Its unique Tropical High Elevation House provides the correct habitat for montane orchids and companion plants from around the equator at elevations of 6,000 to 10,000 feet. An Air Washer System, technology adapted from the textile industry, was combined with traditional greenhouse heating and cooling to create this environment and allows rare orchids to thrive. The Tropical Display House is filled with fragrant orchids from around the world.

Galena is the principal ore and the most important compound of lead. It is a semiconducting material with niche uses. Formation, basic properties, related materials Addition of hydrogen sulfide or sulfide salts to a solution containing a lead salt, such as PbCl2, gives a black precipitate of lead sulfide. : Pb2+ \\\\+ H2S ‚Üí PbS‚Üì + 2 H+ This reaction is used in qualitative inorganic analysis. The presence of hydrogen sulfide or sulfide ions may be tested using \\"lead acetate paper.\\" Like the related materials PbSe and PbTe, PbS is a semiconductor.; In fact, lead sulfide was one of the earliest materials to be used as a semiconductor.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Sulfur. Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A.Jorgensen and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC Lead sulfide crystallizes in the sodium chloride motif, unlike many other IV-VI semiconductors. Since PbS is the main ore of lead, much effort has focused on its conversion. A major process involves smelting of PbS followed by reduction of the resulting oxide. Idealized equations for these two steps are: : 2 PbS + 3 O2 ‚Üí 2 PbO + 2 SO2 : PbO + C ‚Üí Pb + CO The sulfur dioxide is converted to sulfuric acid. = Nanoparticles = Lead sulfide-containing nanoparticle and quantum dots have been well studied. Traditionally, such materials are produced by combining lead salts with a variety of sulfide sources. PbS nanoparticles have been recently examined for use in solar cells. Applications Although of little commercial value, PbS is one of the oldest and most common detection element materials in various infrared detectors. As an infrared detector, PbS functions as a photon detector, responding directly to the photons of radiation, as opposed to thermal detectors, which respond to a change in detector element temperature caused by the radiation. A PbS element can be used to measure radiation in either of two ways: by measuring the tiny photocurrent the photons cause when they hit the PbS material, or by measuring the change in the material's electrical resistance that the photons cause. Measuring the resistance change is the more commonly used method. At room temperature, PbS is sensitive to radiation at wavelengths between approximately 1 and 2.5 Œºm. This range corresponds to the shorter wavelengths in the infra-red portion of the spectrum, the so-called short-wavelength infrared (SWIR). Only very hot objects emit radiation in these wavelengths. Cooling the PbS elements, for example using liquid nitrogen or a Peltier element system, shifts its sensitivity range to between approximately 2 and 4 Œºm. Objects that emit radiation in these wavelengths still have to be quite hot‚Äîseveral hundred degrees Celsius‚Äîbut not as hot as those detectable by uncooled sensors. (Other compounds used for this purpose include indium antimonide (InSb) and mercury-cadmium telluride (HgCdTe), which have somewhat better properties for detecting the longer IR wavelengths.) The high dielectric constant of PbS leads to relatively slow detectors (compared to silicon, germanium, InSb, or HgCdTe). PbS was once used as a black pigment. Astronomy Elevations above 2.6 km (1.63 mi) on the planet Venus are coated with a shiny substance. Though the composition of this coat is not entirely certain, one theory is that Venus \\"snows\\" crystallized lead sulfide much as Earth snows frozen water. If this is the case, it would be the first time the substance was identified on a foreign planet. Other less likely candidates for Venus' \\"snow\\" are bismuth sulfide and tellurium. Safety Lead(II) sulfide is so insoluble that it is almost nontoxic, but pyrolysis of the material, as in smelting, gives dangerous fumes. Lead sulfide is insoluble and a stable compound in the pH of blood and so is probably one of the less toxic forms of lead. A large safety risk occurs in the synthesis of PbS using lead carboxylates, as they are particularly soluble and can cause negative physiological conditions.

He won the office after the state's first governor, John Sevier, was prevented by constitutional restrictions from seeking a fourth consecutive term. He quickly became caught up in the growing rivalry between Sevier and Andrew Jackson, and was soundly defeated by Sevier after just one term. Roane served as an attorney general in the Southwest Territory in the early 1790s, and later served as a judge on the state's Superior Court of Law and Equity (1796‚Äì1801) and the Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals (1815‚Äì1819). Early life Roane was born in 1759 or 1760Sources differ regarding Archibald Roane's birthdate and other biographical details. The Tennessee State Museum and the memorial marker at his grave (which was erected in 1918) give the birthdate as 1759; the Tennessee State Library and Archives lists it as \\"circa 1759\\". The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture gives the birthdate as 1760, while the National Governors Association biography also gives a birth year of 1760. An article in the October 1902 The American Historical Magazine and Tennessee Historical Society Quarterly (Vol. VII, number 4, pages 322‚Äì323) gives the birthdate as \\"about 1760\\" and states that Roane and his wife had six children, while the National Governors Association biography reports eight children. in Derry Township (then a part of Lancaster County) in the Province of Pennsylvania.Elbert Watson (1964) and David R. Sowell (1988), Papers of Governor Archibald Roane, 1801‚Äì1803, Tennessee State Library and Archives. He was the son of Andrew and Margaret Walker Roane. Andrew Roane, who was born in Northern Ireland, was one of four sons of Archibald Gilbert Roane, a Scotsman who had been awarded land in Ireland in return for his British military service. All of the sons of Archibald Gilbert Roane emigrated to America. After Andrew and Margaret Roane both died when young Archibald Roane was about eight years old, he was raised by an uncle, John Roane, a Presbyterian minister, who provided him with a good education. During the Revolutionary War, Archibald Roane served in the Continental Army as a member of the Lancaster County Militia (5th Company, 9th Battalion, Pennsylvania Volunteers).Michael Toomey, Archibald Roane, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture He was among the troops who took part in Washington's crossing of the Delaware River and the subsequent Battle of Trenton in December 1776,James Lee McDonough, \\"Archibald Roane,\\" Governors of Tennessee, Vol. 3 (Memphis State University Press, 1979), pp. 63‚Äì76. and was present at the surrender of General Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781.Governor's Information: Tennessee Governor Archibald Roane , National Governors Association website, accessed June 12, 2011 In the 1780s he settled for a time in vicinity of Lexington, Rockbridge County, Virginia, where he studied and later taught at Liberty Hall Academy, a predecessor institution to Washington and Lee University. In Virginia, he married Ann (or Anne) Campbell, whom he had met there, in 1788. Shortly after his marriage in 1788, Roane moved to Jonesborough, Tennessee, then still a part of North Carolina, where he was admitted to the bar and began the practice of law. In 1790, when the Southwest Territory was formed, territorial governor William Blount appointed Roane to the position of Attorney and Solicitor for Greene County and later Territorial Attorney General for the Washington District. In 1796, he represented Jefferson County at the state constitutional convention. This convention wrote the original Tennessee Constitution, which took effect that same year when Tennessee became a U.S. state. Later in 1796, he became one of the three judges of the Superior Court of Law and Equity, the highest court established under the new state constitution. Governor of Tennessee In 1801, Governor John Sevier had reached the limit of three consecutive terms allowed as governor under the state constitution, and Roane ran virtually unopposed to become his successor.Our Campaigns ‚Äì Archibald Roane. Retrieved: January 18, 2013. The Great Seal of Tennessee was adopted during the Roane Administration in 1801, and Tennessee was divided into three Congressional districts. Roane also signed anti-fraud measures, a law outlawing dueling, and a law prohibiting the disturbance of public worship. Like his predecessor, much of Roane's time as governor was spent dealing with disputes between white settlers and Indians. Roane coordinated efforts to begin construction of the Natchez Trace, convincing Secretary of War Henry Dearborn to construct inns and military posts along the road, and provide rewards for the apprehension of bandits who harassed Natchez travellers. He also appointed a commission that successfully resolved a boundary dispute with Virginia. In October 1802, Spain revoked American access to the critical port of New Orleans following the port's transfer to France, and Roane, acting on orders from President Jefferson, prepared the state militia for possible armed conflict. The situation was resolved by the Louisiana Purchase the following year. In February 1803, the state militia convened to elect its commander. The vote ended in a tie between Sevier and Andrew Jackson, and the constitution stipulated that the governor cast the deciding vote. Jackson presented Roane with evidence that Sevier had been complicit in the forging of deeds at North Carolina's Nashville land office in the 1780s, and Roane cast the deciding vote for Jackson. Enraged that Jackson, 20 years his junior and lacking in military experience, had defeated him for militia commander, Sevier immediately embarked upon a campaign to regain the governorship. Roane and Jackson released the Nashville land office documents and accused Sevier of trying to thwart an investigation into the matter while he was governor, but Sevier's popularity proved insurmountable. On election day, Sevier defeated Roane, 6,780 votes to 4,923. Later life After losing the 1803 gubernatorial election, Roane returned to the practice of law. In 1805, he again challenged Sevier for the governorship, but was defeated, 10,293 votes to 5,795. In 1811, Roane was elected to a circuit judgeship, and in 1815, he became a judge on the Tennessee Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals, which had replaced the Superior Court of Law and Equity as the state's highest court in 1809.Charles A.

It is inspired by the intellectual ferment at the turn of the 20th century. Educational thinkers such as Maria Montessori and John Dewey influenced Parkhurst while she created the Dalton Plan. Their aim was to achieve a balance between a child's talent and the needs of the community. Founding by Helen Parkhurst The American teacher Helen Parkhurst developed what has come to be called the Dalton Plan as a reform to existing philosophies of teaching and classroom management. Spread of school philosophy world-wide In the 1920s and 1930s, Dalton education was spread throughout the world. There is no certainty regarding the exact numbers of Dalton schools, but there was Dalton education in America, Australia, England, Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, India, China and Japan. Particularly in the Netherlands, China and Japan, Dalton education has remained in existence. In recent years there has been a revival of international interest. It crops up again, for instance, in England, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Netherlands is the country with the highest density of Dalton schools. In 2013 there were five hundred; most of them elementary schools. Comprising five percent of all elementary schools, Dalton education is by far the largest educational reform movement in the Netherlands. And, contrary to Montessori, Jena Plan and Waldorf education, it is steadily on the increase. The only Dalton school in the USA, is the school that Helen Parkhurst founded herself in 1919, and which she was subsequently to direct for more than twenty years: the Dalton School in New York. It is a renowned school. But today its fame is not due to its origins as an experiment in progressive education: the Dalton School is one of the most expensive private schools in New York. Characteristics Parkhurst's specific objectives were as follows: # To tailor each student's program to his or her needs, interests and abilities. # To promote each student's independence and dependability. # To enhance the student's social skills. # To increase their sense of responsibility toward others. She developed a three-part plan that continues to be the structural foundation of a Dalton education: # The House, a social community of students. # The Assignment, a monthly goal which students contract to complete. # The Laboratory, a subject-based classrooms intended to be the center of the educational experience. The laboratory involves students from fourth grade through the end of secondary education. Students move between subject \\"laboratories\\" (classrooms) and explore themes at their own pace. Introduction in UK On May 27, 1920, a very enthusiastic article describing the working of the Dalton Plan in detail was published in the Times' Educational Supplement. Parkhurst \\"has given to the secondary school the leisure and culture of the University student; she has uncongested the curriculum; she has abolished the teacher's nightly preparation of classes and the child's nightmare of homework. At the same time the children under her regime cover automatically all the ground prescribed for examinations 'of matriculation standard,' and examination failures among them are nil.\\" The Dalton Plan is a method of education by which pupils work at their own pace, and receive individual help from the teacher when necessary. There is no formal class instruction. Students draw up time-tables and are responsible for finishing the work on their syllabuses or assignments. Students are also encouraged to help each other with their work. The underlying aim of the Dalton Plan is to achieve the highest mental, moral, physical and spiritual development of the pupil. In the spring of 1921, English headmistress Rosa Bassett went to the Children's University School and stayed with Parkhurst. They spent hours talking about education. Parkhurst found Bassett in complete agreement with her ideas: \\"She was Dalton,\\" Parkhurst wrote 50 years later. She described Bassett and Belle Rennie as the two people in England who were most enthusiastic and most helpful about the introduction of the Dalton Plan. It was in 1922 that the UK Board of Education gave official approval and many hundreds of schools in England adopted some form of the Dalton Plan. That same year Parkhurst published Education on the Dalton Plan. In time it was claimed that there were a thousand \\"Dalton\\" schools in Japan, another thousand in India, and many in the Soviet Union, Poland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Schools Today there are a number of schools around the world and that employ variations of teaching methods based on the Dalton Plan. Most of the schools listed below interpret the Dalton Plan according to their needs; in some cases, they retain only a minimal part of the original Dalton Plan. As of this date, the only schools that have strong affiliation with Helen Parkhurst's Dalton School in New York are Dalton Tokyo and Dalton Nagoya. =List of schools= Australia *Ascham School, Sydney Austria *Europaschule, Wien *HTBL Lastenstra√üe, Klagenfurt *Internationale Daltonschule mit IT-Schwerpunkt Wels Belgium *Basisschool De Kleine Icarus, Gent *Basisschool De Lotus, Gent *Basisschool Dalton 1 Hasselt *Basisschool Dalton 2 Hasselt *Middelbare Dalton school VanVeldeke Hasselt *Het Leerlabo, kleuter-, lager en secundair daltononderwijs, WesterloHet Leerlabo, Website *Dalton Middenschool Lyceum, Gent China *Shanghai East Century School, Shanghai *Little Dalton Kindergarten, Hong Kong * Dalton School Hong Kong, Hong Kong Czech Republic *Z≈† a M≈† Chalabalova, Brno *Z≈† a M≈† Husova, Brno *Z≈† a M≈† K≈ô√≠dlovick, Brno *Z≈† a M≈† Mutƒïnick√°, Brno *Z≈† R√°jec-Jest≈ôeb√≠ *Gymn√°zium Slovansk√© n√°mƒïst√≠, Brno *Z≈† Bene≈°ova T≈ôeb√≠ƒç *Z√°kladn√≠ ≈°kola, Brno *Z√°kladn√≠ ≈°kola Brno, Brno Germany * Angell Akademie, FreiburgAngell Akademie, Website * Gymnasium Alsdorf, AlsdorfGymnasium Alsdorf, Website * Grundschule Unstruttal, Ammern, near M√ºhlhausenGrundschule Unstruttal, Website * Marie-Kahle-Gesamtschule Bonn, BonnMarie-Kahle-Gesamtschule, Website * Albrecht-D√ºrer-Gymnasium Berlin, BerlinAlbrecht-D√ºrer-Gymnasium, Website * Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium, Dinslaken * Schillerschule, ErfurtSchillerschule Erfurt, Website * Gymnasium Essen- √úberruhr, EssenGymnasium Essen-√úberruhr, Website * Internationale Gesamtschule Heidelberg, Heidelberghttps://igh-heidelberg.com/ueber-uns/dalton-konzept, Website (German) * Gymnasium Lage, LageGymnasium Lage, Website *Gymnasium Vegesack India Global School, Rahuri.

The trail travels through forests of birch, aspen, pine, fir, and cedar. Hikers enjoy views of boreal forests, the Sawtooth Mountains, babbling brooks, rushing waterfalls, and abundant wildlife. The lowest point in the path is above sea level and the highest point is above sea level. The footpath is intended for hiking only. Motorized vehicles, mountain bikes, and horses are not allowed on the trail. Many people use the trail for long-distance hiking, and facilitating this purpose are 94 backcountry, fee- free campsites. History Construction of the Superior Hiking Trail began in the mid-1980s, and the trail now extends from the Minnesota-Wisconsin border southwest of Duluth to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. In addition there are of spur trails that connect trailheads to the main trail. Inspiration for building the trail came from the Appalachian Trail, which extends from Georgia to Maine. The Superior Hiking Trail Association (SHTA) was formed in 1986 to manage the construction, planning, and day-to-day care of the trail. The SHTA received several grants from the State of Minnesota, three of which were from the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources. This money helped jump start the construction of the trail and funded construction for the first few years. In 1987, the trail had an opening ceremony at Britton Peak to celebrate the beginning of construction. The ceremony included a log-cutting event and many state government officials and SHTA founders attended. Three years later, in August 1990, the trail had reached a half-way mark and another celebration was held. That celebration included a hike for about a dozen brave hikers who completed it in 12 days.Superior Hiking Trail Association: Guide to the Superior Hiking Trail, Seventh Edition, Pages 10-11, Superior Hiking Trail Association, 2013. Since 1991, a ultramarathon known as the \\"Superior 100\\", along with several other races, has been hosted annually on the Superior Hiking Trail. In 1995, Paul Hlina, who was paralyzed from the waist down, hiked the entire trail on crutches and is now known as the first hiker to thru-hike the trail. He raised $16,000 in pledges for the Superior Hiking Trail Association, the non-profit organization which maintains the trail.Superior Hiking Trail Association: Guide to the Superior Hiking Trail, Fifth Edition, Page 11, Ridgeline Press, 2007. Trail construction and improvements continued, and in 2016, the 30th year of trail construction, the Superior Hiking Trail became a continuous footpath from the Minnesota- Wisconsin border to the 270 Degree Overlook near the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The Superior Hiking Trail is now a portion of the North Country National Scenic Trail, a National Scenic Trail that stretches over from North Dakota to Vermont. Sections of the trail Crow Creek in winter from the SHT There are two primary sections to the Superior Hiking Trail. The Duluth section of the trail comprises and starts southwest of the city of Duluth at the Minnesota- Wisconsin border. The trail extends to the northeast through Jay Cooke State Park, the Spirit Mountain Recreation Area, Brewer Park, Enger Park, the Historic Downtown Area, Canal Park, the Lakewalk, and Hartley Nature Center,http://www.hartleynature.org/index.html before it ends at a trailhead located on Martin Road on the north side of the city. The Duluth section is particularly suited for day hiking. There is only one backcountry campground, located near the Minnesota-Wisconsin border, along the Duluth section. The North Shore section of the trail is long and begins at the Martin Road Trailhead on the northern boundary of the City of Duluth. From there, the trail extends to the northeast along Lake Superior through seven state parks, including Gooseberry Falls State Park, Split Rock Lighthouse State Park and Tettegouche State Park. This section of the SHT passes near the towns of Lutsen and Grand Marais, and ends just before the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. The North Shore section provides backcountry experiences and is utilized by both day hikers and backpackers. The Superior Hiking Trail Association maintains 93 backcountry campgrounds along the North Shore section, and a traditional thru-hike of the Superior Hiking Trail typically spans this section. The total elevation gain along the North Shore section is 37,800 feet (11,500 m) and the elevation loss is 37,400 feet (11,400 m) for a northbound hiker. On the northern end the Superior Hiking Trail is connected to the long Border Route Trail which starts a short distance from the trail head on Otter Lake Road. This then connects to the long Kekekabic Trail which gives the hiker the ability to hike all the way through the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and end near Ely. The Superior Hiking Trail Association Looking east from Lookout Mountain in Cascade River State Park Temperance River State Park Bridge The Superior Hiking Trail Association (SHTA) builds, promotes and maintains the trail. It is a Minnesota-based non-profit corporation with more than 3200 members. The association produces a quarterly newsletter called The Ridgeline for its members which contains noteworthy news of the trail, trail volunteer bios, and association financial information. The most visible activities of the SHTA are the popular organized hikes featuring leaders with interpretive skills, such as naturalists, geologists, photographers, and historians and ranging from day hikes to backpacking trips of several days' duration. The trail was mostly built by crews of people that were hired from local towns or by the Minnesota Conservation Corps. In addition, the SHTA coordinates the efforts of numerous volunteers who assist with trail and campground construction and maintenance. These volunteers include interested individuals, scout troops, and other outdoor organizations. Some groups have chosen to adopt a section of the trail to maintain, while others participate in scheduled maintenance hikes. Accolades Caribou River In December, 2000, Backpacker Magazine named the Superior Hiking Trail the trail with the \\"Best Trail/Camp/Shelter conditions,\\" the trail with the \\"Best Signage\\" in the country, and one of the most scenic trails in the nation. According to Andrew Skurka of National Geographic, Superior Hiking Trail is one of his ten favorite hikes in America. In the May, 2005, Readers Digest listed Superior Hiking Trail as one of the \\"5 Best Hikes in America\\".

(Societ√† Piemontese Automobili), was an Italian automobile, military vehicle and aero-engine manufacturer founded in Turin by Matteo Ceirano and Michele Ansaldi. It was active between 1906 and 1926. In 1908, it merged with Fabbrica Ligure Automobili Genova (FLAG) and the new company, Societ√† Ligure Piemontese Automobili, was headquartered in Genoa while manufacturing in Turin. In 1923 it moved to Turin and in 1925 was taken over by Fiat, whereby car manufacture ceased but commercial and military vehicle production continued. Although car production resumed after World War II, by 1947 the company was fully absorbed into Fiat. Ceirano family background The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R./Rapid (Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid); SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni's son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal.Lancia, the essentials In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" co- founded Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and in 1922 they took control of Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA).

It is part of the \\"103rd Compagnie Arditi Camionettisti\\", half of which fought on the Tunisian Front and the other half on the Libyan Front. The company was established in 1906 by Matteo Ceirano and Michele Ansaldi (founder of Ansaldi automobiles) in Turin under the name of Societ√† Piemontese Automobili. The chief designer was Alberto Ballacco. In 1908, the company merged with Fabbrica Ligure Automobili Genova (FLAG) and the new company became Societ√† Ligure Piemontese Automobili. The headquarters was in Genoa while production continued in Turin. During World War I the company produced aero engines such as the 6A. Shortly afterwards, in 1916, both Ceirano and Ansaldi left. In 1923 the company moved to Turin. Severe financial problems lead to a take-over by Fiat in 1925 and the discontinuation of car manufacture in favor of commercial and military vehicles. After World War II they resumed car production, but, in 1947, the company was fully absorbed into Fiat. Cars 1922 SPA 23S at Museo dell'Automobile The first S.P.A.s designed by Alberto Ballacco and Ceirano were the 28/40HP and 60/70 HP which had four cylinder engines, side valves and live rear axles. They were exhibited at the Esposizione di Torino.The Complete History of the Motor Car by G.N. Georgano. Ebury Press 1973. pp 636 By 1907 they also produced two six-cylinder models, one of which had the flywheel mounted at the front of the crankshaft. By 1911 they had introduced L-head monobloc engine designs, unitary gearboxes, and High tension magneto ignition systems. The next year they sold 500 cars and introduced a new four cylinder 14/16 hp engine as the basis of their modern, compact car. By 1914 the range included twin, four and six cylinder cars - the biggest had an 11,536cc displacement. After World War I production resumed with the pre-war models; the 14/16 HP using a 2.700cc side-valve engine and the '25/30 HP using a 4,400cc six cylinder engine. In 1922 the highly sophisticated 30/40 Super Sports was launched, with a 4,400cc six cylinder engine, using twin overhead camshafts (dohc) operating four valves per cylinder. The aluminium alloy cylinders had steel liners and aluminium pistons, plus dual carburettors and dual-ignition. The car was also equipped with front-wheel brakes and a V-shaped radiator. By the next year, the sporting range was marketed as Tipo 23, Tipo 24 and Tipo 25. Racing In 1908 Ernesto Ceirano finished third in the Targa Florio driving a four-cylinder, 7,785cc, S.P.A. 28/40 HP.

A veteran of the American Revolution, he had previously served in the legislature of the Southwest Territory (1794-96), and as Speaker of the Tennessee Senate (1805-11). Following his term as governor, he served as an agent to the Cherokee for the United States government.John Thweatt, \\"Joseph McMinn\\", Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2010; retrieved September 18, 2012. Early life McMinn was born in West Marlborough Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, and was one of ten children.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 49‚Äì59. He obtained only a limited rural education, and even in his later years would be described as a \\"rustic frontiersman.\\" Though raised as a Quaker, he joined the Continental Army during the American Revolution. In 1786, McMinn moved to Hawkins County, Tennessee, where he had purchased a farm. In 1792, Southwest Territory governor William Blount appointed McMinn justice of the peace for Hawkins County,Daily Post Athenian: Bicentennial Edition, 1976 1B, transcribed by Bill Bigham at TNGenWeb.org. Retrieved: September 19, 2012. and McMinn represented Hawkins County in the territorial legislature from 1794 to 1796. He also served as an officer in the territorial militia, eventually rising to the rank of brigade commander. Career McMinn was a delegate to the 1796 constitutional convention and helped write the state constitution that came into effect when Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796. He was chosen to deliver a copy of the completed document to the federal government in Philadelphia. He served in the Tennessee Senate from 1797 to 1801, and from 1803 to 1811, and was Speaker of the Senate from 1805 to 1811. In 1815, McMinn ran for governor against four other prominent state politicians: Senator Jesse Wharton, Congressman Robert Weakley, former speaker of the state house Robert Foster, and fellow state constitutional convention delegate Thomas Henderson. Though his opponents assailed him in the press, McMinn won the election with a plurality of over 15,000 of the 37,000 votes cast. He was reelected in 1817, again defeating Foster, and elected to a third term in 1819, defeating Enoch Parsons. While governor, McMinn concentrated on peaceful relationships with Native Americans in order to ease the way for more white settlement, particularly to the west. The Chickasaw Purchase Treaty, or Western Purchase, in which most of what is now West Tennessee was acquired, was accomplished during his tenure as governor. Fourteen new counties were created. The Calhoun Treaty (or Hiwassee Purchase), in which the United States acquired a portion of southeastern Tennessee, was also negotiated during his tenure.Stanley Folmsbee, Sectionalism and Internal Improvements in Tennessee, 1796‚Äì1845 (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1939), pp. 27‚Äì33. Following the Panic of 1819, McMinn called a joint session of the state legislature in June 1820, which voted to establish a state bank that would provide low-interest loans. This agitated many of McMinn's fellow East Tennesseans, who had for years been complaining about lack of state appropriations for internal improvements, namely navigational improvements on the upper Tennessee River. The legislature used state-owned lands from the Hiwassee Purchase to provide financial backing for the new bank. Upon his retirement as governor due to the term limits in the 1796 constitution that he had helped to draft, he returned to his farm in Hawkins County. In 1823, he moved to a farm along the Hiwassee River near Calhoun, Tennessee, and served as an agent for the federal government at the nearby Cherokee Agency until the time of his death. Family life and legacy McMinn married his first wife, Anna Cooper, in 1785, and they had one daughter, Jane. Following the death of his first wife, McMinn married Rebecca Kincade. She died in January 1815, and his only child, Jane, died two weeks later. In 1816, he married Nancy Glasgow Williams, the daughter of disgraced North Carolina Secretary of State James Glasgow, formerly married to Willoughby Williams, a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives.Zella Armstrong, Some Tennessee Heroes of the Revolution: Compiled from Pension Statements, Genealogical Publishing Com, 2009, p. 117 This marriage ended in a controversial separation and a failed attempt at divorce in 1821.Jeannette Tillotson Acklen, Tennessee Records, Bible Records and Marriage Bonds (Nashville: 1933). Transcribed at Biblerecords.com. Retrieved: September 19, 2012. In 1942, a portrait of McMinn that had been painted by noted artist Rembrandt Peale in 1796 was discovered in Philadelphia. McMinn apparently posed for the portrait during his visit to the city to deliver the newly written Tennessee state constitution to the federal government. The Tennessee Historical Society purchased the painting for the state. McMinn County, Tennessee, and the town of McMinnville, Tennessee, in Warren County, are named in Joseph McMinn's honor. William T. Newby, the founder of McMinnville, Oregon, named the city after his hometown of McMinnville, Tennessee. McMinn joined the Presbyterian Church late in life, and was buried in an unmarked grave at the Shiloh Presbyterian Cemetery in Calhoun. In 1880, his namesake McMinn County attempted to have his grave reinterred in its county seat of Athens, but an eccentric preacher named R.J.M. Only, who was the only person who knew the grave's location, refused to reveal the location.

The original 5251-1 had a much smaller keyboard.An IBM System/34 IBM 5250 is a family of block-oriented terminals originally introduced with the IBM System/34 midrange computer systems in 1977. It also connects to the later System/36, System/38, and AS/400 and System i systems, and to IBM Power Systems systems running IBM i. Components 5250 devices can be directly attached to the host or communicate remotely using Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) at up to 9600bit/s. Devices can also be clustered or daisy- chained. In 1980 the 5250 system consisted of the following components: * 5251 Display Station. The monochrome text-only display can be either 960 characters, formatted as 12 lines of 80 characters, or 1920 characters as 24 lines of 80 characters. Upper and lower case is standard. Text attributes consist of blink, high intensity, reverse video, non-display, underscore, and a unique column separator that causes the field to be preceded and followed by a vertical bar. 5251 and 5252 input format control attributes are optimized for data entry applications and offer significant enhancements over previous 3270 terminals. * 5252 Dual Display Station. The 5252 features a single CRT displayed 12 lines each on two different sides back to back in a single case, with separate keyboards. The 5252 was not part of the initial announcement. * 5256 printer. The 5256 is a tabletop serial dot matrix printer with three models providing speeds of 40, 60, or 120cps and a print line of 132 characters. =5251/5252 format control= Field attributes also define the type of data the operator can enter into a field, and specify other control information for the field. * A field can be defined as alpha only, numeric only, or alphanumeric. *Auto enter simulates an ENTER key press at the conclusion of the field. *Bypass automatically skips over a field in the screen. *Duplicate enable allows the operator to press the DUP key in a field, entering a special code which is interpreted by the application program ‚Äì typically duplicating data in this field from the previous record or line. *Field exit required forces the operator to manually exit this field, rather than automatically advancing to the next field after entering the last character. *Mandatory entry specifies that the operator _must_ enter data in this field and is not allowed to tab over it. *Monocase translates lower-case characters entered into this field to upper-case. *Mandatory fill specifies that this field must be entirely filled if any data is entered into it. *Right adjust will right adjust data entered in a field when the operator exits the field. *Signed numeric reserves the rightmost position of a field for a sign ‚Äì blank for positive or '-' for negative. Historical origins The 5250 is a block-oriented terminal similar to, but not compatible with, the IBM 3270. Robustly constructed, 5251 terminals weigh roughly . The devices generate an audible clicking sound as the user types, similar to the electric typewriters of the era. The 5250 data stream definition has been refined over time to include GUI elements such as pop-up windowing, check and option boxes, mouse handling, and pull-down menus. The term \\"5250\\" now refers to the data stream itself. Few physical 5250 terminals with their bulky twinax cables still exist, although they are occasionally still used to provide a \\"connection of last resort,\\" hard-wired to the host computer. Today, it is more common to use PC or web-based terminal emulation packages that can interpret and display 5250 data streams. Telnet 5250 Telnet 5250, or TN5250 describes either the process of sending and receiving 5250 data streams using the telnet protocol or the software that emulates a 5250 class terminal communication via that process. TN5250 allows a 5250 terminal emulator to communicate over a TCP/IP network instead of an SNA network. Standard telnet clients cannot be used as a substitute for TN5250 clients, as they use a different data stream format. Interfacing 5250 terminals with commodity hardware An interface was created that allows to connect to the Twinax port of a 5250 terminal and communicate with it like an AS/400 hosthttps://github.com/inmbolmie/5250_usb_converterhttps://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t;=23885.

History The RSL originated in the Revolutionary Tendency within the International Socialists (U.S.) (IS) led by Sy Landy and Ron Tabor. They had three principal differences with the IS: they believed that the IS had abandoned strict adherence to Trotskyism; they felt that the emphasis on the day-to-day work within the trade unions diminished propagating the revolutionary objectives outlined in the Fourth International's transitional program; and they felt that the USSR and the other Communist states were state capitalist, rather than bureaucratic collectivist.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 pp. 903‚Äì904 While the RT at first seemed to have the upper hand, with Landy elected national secretary in 1972, by the next year Landy and his faction had been expelled. At the time of the split, the RSL took 100 of the IS's 300 members. The expelled group, now styling itself the Revolutionary Socialist League, adopted generally orthodox Trotskyist positions based on the transitional program including permanent revolution, opposition to popular fronts and the need for a Fourth International. This last position cost them unity with the Class Struggle League, who advocated a Fifth International. Landy wrote \\"To preserve the program is to preserve the number and out right to it\\". Despite this the RSL never joined any existing Trotskyist international or attempted to organize a new one. Its sole international organizational tie was with the Revolutionary Marxist League of Jamaica. The RSL was active within a few unions, particularly United Auto Workers (UAW) and USW and among Hispanic workers in the Los Angeles ILGWU. Within the UAW they organized a \\"Revolutionary Action Caucus\\". Outside of organized labor they participated in anti-apartheid and anti-racist movements and developed a prisoner support network.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 p. 905 The RSL was one of the left groups most active in the pre-AIDS gay movement. Rick Miles considered this area \\"particularly important\\" because he believed that much of the left suffered from the same homophobia as the rest of society, and because the \\"gay question\\" had a direct bearing on their concept of socialism as a \\"free society\\" run directly by workers and oppressed people, rather than an authoritarian society run by a state capitalist class. It also emphasized the oppressive nature of the Stalinist countries where homosexuals were repressed. The RSL recruited a minority tendency of the Red Flag Union, a gay socialist collective, to its state capitalist characterization, and they merged into the League in 1977. (A majority of the RFU joined the Spartacist League.) In New York, the RSL was active in the Gay Activists Alliance, its members and sympathizers participating in a polarizing split that proved the end of that organization. RSL members also participated in gay coalitions such as Lavender Left and Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee. The RSL had its share of organizational difficulties. In early 1974, it suffered its first split. The origins of this split went back to a group called the Communist faction within the Socialist Workers Party that left to SWP to enter IS, and subsequently the RSL. Within the RSL it formed the \\"Soviet Defensist Minority\\" before leaving to form the Trotskyist Organization of the United States.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 p. 906 Another tendency had left in 1975 to form the Revolutionary Marxist Committee, which later fused with the Socialist Workers Party.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 p. 907 Finally a group led by Sy Landy left in 1976 to form the League for the Revolutionary Party, in part because they disagreed with the RSL's call for the formation of a Labor Party in the US. They also alleged that the leadership of the RSL was acting in a bureaucratic fashion. Over time, the RSL moved closer to anarchism. In 1985 they released a statement What we stand for that proclaimed their adherence to the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky but emphasized the theoretical contributions of Marx and Engels, Trotsky's fight against Stalinism and Lenin's \\"conception of the party, stress on the importance of national liberation struggles and the anti-statism shown in the State and Revolution\\". It also identified \\"with the best of anarchism, particularly its libertarian spirit\\".Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 pp. 903‚Äì904 Their move away from Leninism is documented in a book by RSL leader Ron Tabor titled A Look at Leninism (), which collected together a series of articles questioning the fundamentals of Leninism that had appeared as a serial series in The Torch newspaper. The RSL disbanded in 1989, with about twenty of its remaining members helping in the formation of Love and Rage Network, a revolutionary anarchist newspaper and organization. The RSL met to disband the day before the founding conference of Love and Rage. When Love and Rage disbanded in 1998, the remaining former RSL members, including Ron Tabor, began publishing The Utopian.\\"Nine Years of the Love and Rage Revolutionary Anarchist Federation\\" by Wayne Price, Northeastern Anarchist #3, Fall 2001. Some time later they entered the platformist anarchist federation North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists.  League for the Revolutionary Party  The League for the Revolutionary Party is a Trotskyist organisation in the United States. The group was founded by a faction of the now defunct Revolutionary Socialist League in 1976. The RSL had in turn split from the International Socialists in 1973. The LRP took from the RSL a strong stress on the need for a Leninist party and coupled this with an emphasis on the general strike tactic. They also developed their own version of what is called \\"state capitalist theory\\" to explain the class nature of the USSR and similar states. In later years they abandoned use of the term \\"state capitalist\\" in favor of the term \\"statified capitalism, arguing the difference between Stalinist and traditional capitalist countries is in the form that the ruling class holds its property, and that the proletariat is still exploited and surplus value created in the same way. The LRP views the state in Stalinist countries as a weaker form of the capitalist state, less capable of exploiting the workers but still ruling in the interest of the bureaucracy. This form of state is seen as a compromise by the ruling class, sacrificing a portion of profits to pacify the workers and prevent proletarian revolutions. As such, the LRP viewed the collapse of the Soviet Union as a defeat for the workers not because the workers lost control of the state, as many Trotskyists believe, but because of the increased rate of exploitation and destruction of social welfare programs that accompanied the collapse. The group is based in New York City with a branch in Chicago. It also organizes a group of international co-thinkers called the Communist Organisation for a Fourth International. They publish a journal called Proletarian Revolution, formerly Socialist Voice, to which the late Sy Landy and Walter Daum have been notable contributors.

He was the first Republican elected to the position since 1960, and the first to hold the office since 1965. Biography Bangerter was born in Granger, Utah (now West Valley City) to William Henry Bangerter and Isabelle Bawden. His older brother, W. Grant Bangerter, served as a General Authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Bangerter married his wife, the former Colleen Monson, in 1953. The two had six children and one foster son. Prior to his election, Bangerter founded a successful construction firm which specialized in building homes. He served in the Utah House of Representatives from 1975 to 1985 and as Speaker of that body from 1981 until 1985. During his tenure as governor, Bangerter dealt with the flooding of the Great Salt Lake and its tributaries by approving the construction of large, US$60 million pumps to channel excess water from the Great Salt Lake onto the Bonneville Salt Flats. This was initially successful, yet caused some controversy when the lake's water level fell in later years, and some regarded the idle pumps as wasteful. Bangerter's \\"foremost interest was improving the state's educational system\\". After his retirement as governor, Bangerter returned to his construction firm and served for three years as president of the South Africa Johannesburg Mission of the LDS Church from 1996 to 1999. The Bangerter Highway (SR-154), which opened in 1998, was named after the former governor, who had long supported such a road. In 2008, Bangerter was appointed to the Governing Board for the national children's charity Operation Kids. On April 14, 2015, Bangerter suffered a stroke and later died at the age of 82.

He held the office longer than any other person, including the state's only other six-term governor, John Sevier. He is considered one of the state's most popular political figures of the 1820s, and is credited with initiating numerous legal and tax reforms.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 59‚Äì63, 78‚Äì80, 91‚Äì93. Carroll joined the Tennessee militia as a captain in 1812, and quickly rose through the ranks. He participated in several engagements during the Creek War, and, as a major-general, commanded Andrew Jackson's center at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.Emma Carroll Tucker, \\"Governor William Carroll,\\" Tennessee Historical Society Quarterly, Vol. 2, No. 3, pp. 388‚Äì396. Early life Like two of his predecessors, Archibald Roane and Joseph McMinn, Carroll was a native of Pennsylvania, having been born near Pittsburgh. His father, Thomas Carroll, was a business associate of Albert Gallatin, and had established a successful chain of hardware stores in the Pittsburgh area. William Carroll had little formal education as a child, but acquired practical learning from working in his father's business. He moved to Nashville in 1808 and established a branch store in the city.Augustus Buell, History of Andrew Jackson: Pioneer, Patriot, Soldier, Politician and President, Vol. I (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1904), pp. 284‚Äì87. He presented himself to Andrew Jackson with a letter of introduction from Gallatin. War of 1812 and Creek War At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Carroll was appointed captain of the Nashville Uniform Volunteers, and joined Andrew Jackson's Creek campaign. Within a few months, he had been promoted to major, and took part in the Battle of Talladega in November 1813. For his actions in this battle, he was promoted to colonel. He fought at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek in January 1814, and was wounded at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in March 1814. In 1813, Carroll became involved in a quarrel with another Jackson subordinate, Jesse Benton, that culminated in a duel on June 14 of that year. Jackson initially tried to defuse the quarrel, but, unsuccessful, he agreed to be Carroll's second. In the duel, Carroll lost part of his thumb, and Benton was shot through the hip, but both survived. Benton's older brother, Thomas Hart Benton, was enraged after hearing Jackson had supported Carroll, and would later injure Jackson in a brawl in Nashville over the incident.Tom Horton, \\"Jackson-Benton Quarrel Typical of Early Southern Politics ,\\" Moultrie News, February 6, 2008. Retrieved September 21, 2012. After the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Carroll returned to Nashville to recruit troops for the defense of New Orleans. After Jackson resigned from the militia to accept a commission in the federal army, Carroll was elected major-general of the Tennessee militia. Traveling via the Cumberland, Ohio and Mississippi rivers, his new troops arrived in New Orleans just prior to the British invasion. At the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, Carroll's troops fought near the center of Jackson's line, where some of the most intense fighting occurred. Politics Following the war, Carroll resumed his business career in Nashville. In 1818, he became part owner of the New Orleans steamboat, the General Jackson. On March 11, 1819, after a treacherous journey up the Mississippi, Ohio and Cumberland rivers, the General Jackson became the first steamboat to reach Nashville.Paul Bergeron, Stephen Ash, and Jeanette Keith, Tennesseans and Their History (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999), p. 113. During the Panic of 1819, Carroll's business failed, and he was forced into bankruptcy. In 1821, Carroll, still immensely popular from his War of 1812 endeavors, ran for governor. Although his opponent, Edward Ward, was backed by the state's political elite, including Andrew Jackson, Hugh Lawson White and Joseph McMinn, Carroll gained the support of Jackson foes John Williams and Davy Crockett, and was able to harness the anti- establishment sentiment that had arisen in the wake of the financial crisis. He easily defeated Ward on election day, 32,290 votes to 7,294. He immediately set out to reform the state's tax laws, but his call for a constitutional convention was defeated by the legislature. As Tennessee's economy improved, Carroll's popularity soared. He ran unopposed for reelection in 1823 and 1825. In 1827, at the end of his third two-year term, constitutional term limits prevented him from serving a fourth consecutive term. He was succeeded by Sam Houston. After he was passed over for a U. S. Senate seat, he became wary of the Jacksonites, and ran against Houston in 1829. Houston resigned following a scandal shortly after Carroll announced his campaign, however, and William Hall, as Speaker of the Senate, succeeded him. Hall refused to run for reelection, and Carroll was easily elected. Carroll successfully sought the office again in 1831 and 1833, and was elected without opposition. Carrol's governorship was noted for the establishment of a more progressive (for the era) Penal Code, which replaced corporal punishment with a state prison system, as well as the establishment of an insane asylum and the establishment of a Chancery Court. He also persistently advocated for government-funded internal improvements, which helped the state's businesses. During his final term, the state constitution of 1796 was supplanted by a new one which gave more executive power to the governor; although this document was technically superseded by the current one in 1870, that document carries over very many of the provisions of the 1834 constitution, upon which it was largely based. Popular provisions in the new constitution included an equitable land tax (which benefited small farmers) and the requirement that county officials be popularly elected, rather than appointed. Carroll claimed that the new constitution allowed him to seek a fourth consecutive term. He was doomed by rising Whig sentiment in the state, however, and lost the gubernatorial election to Newton Cannon by a vote of 41,970 to 31,205. He persistently campaigned for one of the state's U. S. Senate seats in subsequent years, but was never successful. Carroll served as governor of Tennessee longer than anyone else has to this point, even fellow six-term governor Sevier. Sevier's first term was unusually short due to the time of year of the admission of Tennessee into the Union. Carroll's gubernatorial service totaled twelve years and twelve days. Death Carroll lived quietly after his terms as governor ended. He died on March 22, 1844, and is interred at Nashville City Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee. Legacy Carroll County, Tennessee, is named in his honor. Carrollton, New Orleans, Louisiana, is named in his honor.Clare D'Artois Leeper, Louisiana Place Names (LSU Press, 2012), p. 58.

To do so, CBPV introduces a term language that distinguishes computations and values, according to the slogan a value is, a computation does; this term language has a single evaluation order. However, to evaluate a lambda-calculus term according to either the call-by-name (CBN) or call-by- value (CBV) reduction strategy, one can translate the term to CBPV using a call-by-name or call-by-value translation strategy, which give rise to different terms. Evaluating the result of the call-by-value translation corresponds to evaluating the original term with the call-by-value strategy; evaluating the result of the call-by-name translation corresponds instead to evaluating the original term with the call-by-name strategy. This is especially useful when dealing with the semantics of different side effects, such as nontermination, mutable state or nondeterminism. Instead of giving two variants of the semantics, one for the call-by-name evaluation order and one for the call-by-value one, one can simply give a semantics for the CBPV term language; one gets two semantics for lambda-calculus by composing this CBPV semantics with the same CBV and CBN translations from lambda-calculus.

Matsuzaki was editing a Bay Area Japanese magazine, Cohen was waiting tables at a Thai restaurant, and Dieterich and Saunier were doing data entry for legal and consulting firms, but that year they all decided to quit their jobs simultaneously and focus on touring. That year they contributed to Azadi! A Benefit Compilation for the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. Saunier also released Nervous Cop, a collaboration album with Zach Hill and Joanna Newsom. Deerhoof performing in 2004 Deerhoof's next record took its inspiration from a crudely drawn character created by Japanese artist Ken Kagami. 2004's Milk Man the album featured an opulent, campy sound inspired by Broadway and Igor Stravinsky. It was nominated for \\"Outstanding Alternative Album\\" in the California Music Awards, and stayed at #1 on the Dusted Radio Chart for six straight weeks, and reached #1 on the CMJ Core Chart. Also in 2004 Deerhoof received the Editor's Choice Award from 7X7 Magazine, and was voted \\"Best Local Rock Band\\" by readers of SF Weekly. In 2006 Milk Man was adapted to a children's ballet. Deerhoof's next release was their first to be sung in Matsuzaki's native language of Japanese. 2005's mini-album Green Cosmos combined an orchestral sound with dance music styles. Deerhoof spent several months in 2005 in a rented rehearsal space in Oakland, writing and recording daily as a full band. When the result was released that fall, the double album The Runners Four featured each band member taking turns as vocalist, singing unusually wordy lyrics in which Arks and time capsules recur, as though foretelling that this would be the final recording of this lineup. Instrumental roles were reversed for Matsuzaki (now on guitar) and Cohen (now on bass). In 2006, Danielson released the critically acclaimed Ships, which featured Deerhoof as the backing band for many of the tracks. Later that year, after an extensive world tour that ended at Coachella, Deerhoof composed and performed a live soundtrack to Harry Smith's hour-long animation masterpiece Heaven and Earth Magic at the San Francisco International Film Festival. This was to be Cohen's last activity with Deerhoof. The split was amicable and, to commemorate Cohen, Deerhoof posted a free EP on their website, one of several they have posted over the years. Chris Cohen now records and tours as a solo act. =Reconfiguration= Matsuzaki, Saunier, and Dieterich began a new recording as a trio. Despite being recorded mostly in Dieterich's bedroom and being mixed on the band's laptop in hotel rooms during tours with Radiohead, The Flaming Lips, and Beck, Some material was from the \\"Heaven and Earth Magic\\" soundtrack, some was completely orchestral (without drums or guitars), and one song (\\"Matchbook Seeks Maniac\\") was created specifically for the end credits of a Hollywood film..

Prospect Park in Brooklyn in 2008 By January 2008 Deerhoof became a quartet again with the addition of The Flying Luttenbachers/Gorge Trio/XBXRX guitarist and longtime friend Ed Rodriguez. That summer Deerhoof released the song \\"Fresh Born\\" online as sheet music only, anticipating similar experiments by Beck and Blur by several years. Fans recorded and uploaded their own versions of the song to a special site, before anyone outside the band had heard Deerhoof's own version.

Deerhoof performing in 2009 In April 2010 Deerhoof curated the Belgian music festival Sonic City, inviting an eclectic array of European acts including The Go! Team, Paolo Pandolfo, and sitting in with the Belgian punk band The Kids. Then in April and July 2010, Deerhoof and Xiu Xiu joined to perform Joy Division's album Unknown Pleasures live at the Donaufestival in Austria, and at Brooklyn's Williamsburg Waterfront. =Format experimentation= Building on \\"I Did Crimes For You,\\" they continued during this time to record themselves in a rented rehearsal space in Oakland. Musical influences from The Beach Boys, new romanticism, tropicalia, and the Congotronics series all found their way onto 2011's Deerhoof vs. Evil. The band released the album one track at a time via different media outlets online, with a full map and schedule available on their own website. The album received critical acclaim notably from Entertainment Weekly, MOJO, and Paste. Matt Goldman's design was the second Deerhoof album cover to feature a mushroom cloud. A remix of \\"Behold a Marvel in the Darkness\\" was done by Shugo Tokumaru. Deerhoof immediately initiated a 7\\" series wherein guest vocalists (including Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, Kevin Barnes of Of Montreal, singer- songwriter David Bazan, rapper Busdriver, and others) sang new lyrics over an instrumental of a Deerhoof vs. Evil song of their choice. Deerhoof were Wire Magazine's January 2011 cover story. They contributed to Polyvinyl's benefit compilation Japan 3.11.11 joining in the relief efforts to help with the devastation from March's earthquake and tsunami. Throughout the summer of 2011, Deerhoof toured in an international supergroup alongside Konono N¬∞1, Juana Molina, Kasai Allstars and others, called Congotronics Vs. Rockers. Their onstage repertoire included the Deerhoof song \\"Super Duper Rescue Heads\\" from Deerhoof Vs. Evil. In April 2012 Deerhoof collaborated with Questlove, Reggie Watts, Sasha Grey and others in a conceptual concert event called Shuffle Culture at Brooklyn Academy of Music. April 2012 also saw the release of young adult fiction book Rules to Rock By, by Josh Farrar, about a 12-year- old girl who's inspired by Deerhoof to form her own band. Deerhoof's version of LiLiPUT's \\"Hitchhike\\" appears on the soundtrack. In June 2012 at a Deerhoof performance in Chicago's Millennium Park, contemporary classical music ensemble Dal Niente performed Marcos Balter's arrangement of Deerhoof's \\"Eaguru Guru\\". The same month, Deerhoof and The Flaming Lips performed onstage together playing songs by King Crimson, Canned Heat, and Deerhoof. In 2012 Deerhoof also began home-recording their next record Breakup Song. The band said that the album was a response to the tradition of breakup songs, which they felt included too many sad songs and too few empowering ones. After a long final mixing session at Saunier's apartment, Matsuzaki took the front cover photo of a garbage truck in the early morning hours. The Polyvinyl Records release was also released on Joyful Noise Recordings in \\"flexi-book\\" format, allowing the listener to flip from song to song as if each track were a page in a storybook. Deerhoof hero Simeon of Silver Apples made a remix of \\"Mario's Flaming Whiskers III\\". Revealing some of Deerhoof's working methods and group chemistry, a rare full-band interview, with former MTV VJ John Norris, appeared in the fall 2012 Interview Magazine. In October, they released a single \\"Sexy, but Sparkly,\\" produced by Fear of a Black Planet co- producer Chris Shaw, marking the first time Deerhoof worked with a producer. It was recorded as part of the series of short documentaries Masters From Their Day, which chronicles the efforts of a band and a record-producer as they attempt to record and mix a new single in one day. The song then appeared in the LAMC split-7\\" series, in which a more known artist chooses a lesser- known one (Deerhoof chose Half Waif) to make their recorded debut, with proceeds going to the Ariel Panero Memorial Fund at VH1 Save the Music. Deerhoof's twelfth album, 2014's La Isla Bonita was self-recorded live in guitarist Ed Rodriguez's basement during a \\"weeklong sleepover arguing over whether to try and sound like Joan Jett or Janet Jackson\\". The recordings were meant as demos to be rerecorded with former music journalist and Mr. Dream drummer Nick Sylvester, but the band liked the raw DIY versions so much, they just kept them and recorded the vocals with Sylvester. The lyrics were heavily influenced by 24/7, a book by Columbia professor Jonathan Crary. The album art was by Sara Cwynar. Their music video for \\"Exit Only\\" featured Michael Shannon playing two roles, with a cameo by Rodriguez. The Guardian, on their exclusive preview stream of La Isla Bonita, collected testimonials about Deerhoof from a variety of notable musicians and artists, including Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, Henry Rollins, Blur's Graham Coxon, Adam Green, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs's Brian Chase, and David Shrigley. The album received high praise from NPR, A.V. Club, Alternative Press, and The Wire, and was reviewed by Tune- Yards' Merril Garbus for Talkhouse. =20-year anniversary= For Deerhoof and Lightning Bolt's mutual 20-year anniversary, Matt Conboy directed a Pitchfork- premiered documentary called \\"Checking in at 20\\" about their respective drummers. 2014 also saw the release of Deerhoof's contribution to the BOATS compilation, an international arts project featuring and supporting Dalit \\"untouchable\\" children in south-east India and featuring samples of the Light of Love Children's Choir. During the world tour for La Isla Bonita, three complete-performance live videos were shot: their November 4 record release show in Brooklyn, a nine-song Boiler Room session recorded in London while both Rodriguez and Matsuzaki were ill with fevers and Saunier had a black eye, and a December 16 performance recorded at a tiny Tokyo rock club called Fever, resulting in a live album, Fever 121614. The 2015 release included a downloadable video of the entire show, edited by longtime friend and collaborator Noriko Oishi. The LP/CD artwork included a massive collage of fan-contributed drawings of the band in manga style. Also in 2015 Deerhoof contributed a track in support of gay and transgender Hoosiers on the Joyful Noise compilation 50 Bands & a Cat for Indiana Equality. In August of 2015, the band was the first act invited to perform improvisational site-specific noise music at CERN‚Äôs Large Hadron Collider, as part of the Ex/Noise/CERN project, founded by particle physicist James Beacham, who stated, ‚ÄúMusical curiosity is similar to scientific curiosity and, on a personal level, Deerhoof has inspired me as much as Einstein‚Äù. The resulting film of the project quickly became one of the top ten most-watched videos ever produced by CERN and received wide coverage in the music, art, and science press, as well as positive responses from notable artists, musicians, and writers. In 2016 Deerhoof released The Magic. The album blends glam metal, punk, and noise, but also includes a cover of \\"I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire\\" by The Ink Spots. The cover art was by Matsuzaki. Joseph Baughman created the stop-motion music video for the album's \\"The Devil and his Anarchic Surrealist Retinue\\". Baughman described his style as a slow-motion improvisation. The clay animated video features chessboard pieces and multicolored minotaurs. The Magic was the first Deerhoof album to hit #1 on CMJ, and was highly praised by NPR, A.V. Club and Exclaim. A.V. Club invited them to participate in A.V. Undercover, where bands choose from an ever-dwindling list of songs to cover on video. They ended up with \\"Goody Two Shoes\\" by Adam Ant but included an excerpt of \\"Hot for Teacher\\" by Van Halen. Those who pre-ordered The Magic from Polyvinyl were treated to a surprise cassette that included Deerhoof doing covers of Def Leppard, Van Halen, David Bowie, Madonna, Sonic Youth, Malaria!, and Public Enemy. Their cover of \\"Fight the Power\\" appears on the Planned Parenthood benefit compilation Cover Your Ass. They contributed a cover of Xiu Xiu's \\"Hi,\\" played in the style of White Reaper, to the Polyvinyl Plays Polyvinyl compilation. The academic world has gradually come to take the musical, philosophical, and political aspects of Deerhoof's work seriously, an example of which can be seen in an article from The Night Mail about The Magic. After a long world tour for The Magic, Deerhoof was invited by Red Hot Chili Peppers to open their concerts in northern European arenas in November 2016. Deerhoof is confirmed to open for Red Hot Chili Peppers again in summer 2017. They were one of the headliners of 2017's Big Ears Festival. =Joyful Noise Recordings= In 2017 Deerhoof was chosen as Joyful Noise Recordings' Artist in Residence. Deerhoof and several Deerhoof-related collaborative projects will be releasing five new LPs in 2017. Proceeds will be donated to a variety of causes, the first of which will be Brand New Congress. On June 28 Deerhoof announced a new album titled Mountain Moves and premiered the first single \\"I Will Spite Survive\\" (featuring Jenn Wasner on guest vocals) on Democracy Now!. A second single \\"Your Dystopic Creation Does Not Fear You\\" (featuring rapper Awkwafina) was premiered on the Adult Swim Singles Series. Mountain Moves was released on September 8, 2017. On May 29, 2020, the band released their sixteenth album, Future Teenage Cave Artists. They had previously released three singles from it: the title track, \\"The Loved One\\", and \\"Farewell Symphony\\". Future Teenage Cave Artists is notable in that it is Deerhoof‚Äôs first overt concept record. Greg Saunier said in an August 2020 interview that a \\"sort of a sequel\\" to Future Teenage Cave Artists would be \\"coming out in a couple months\\". Musical style and legacy Deerhoof's style has been described as indie rock, noise pop, punk rock, and \\"experimental pop mired in a pure punk sense of adventure\\". AllMusic characterizes them as \\"highly revered indie rockers ... who play fractured, whimsical noise pop with an avant-garde edge\\", while MaineToday describes them as \\"the beloved punk band whose erratic style veers between pop, noise, and classic rock and roll\\". According to Noisey, Deerhoof formed as a \\"minimal noise improv\\" act before shifting to \\"pop-infused noise-punk\\". According to AllMusic, their early releases \\"had a more traditionally harsh, no wave-inspired sound, though they also included the quirky tendencies that dominated their later efforts ... [which] mix noise, sugary melodies, and an experimental spirit into utterly distinctive music that made them one of the most acclaimed acts of the 2000s and 2010s.\\" Impose writes that since \\"their beginnings as a noise punk band ... [Deerhoof have] taken leaps and bounds artistically and stylistically, experimenting with pop and punk in ways we could've never imagined... [and] ultimately [proving] that punk can fit into an artistic world.\\" According to LA Phil, they made \\"some of the most difficult and unclassifiable noise of the mid-‚Äô90s [before] unexpectedly [rising] to international prominence as one of indie rock's most renowned and influential groups ... too \\"pop\\" for \\"noise,\\" and too \\"noise\\" for \\"pop.\\" For the Guardian, their breakthrough after many albums of \\"elliptical art-pop\\" came with Friend Opportunity, which showcased \\"a band playing a constantly shifting mixture of psychedelia, post-punk, jazz and pop, which should have been difficult and forbidding, but was given an accessible focus by the sweet vocals and expressionist lyrics of bassist/chanteuse Satomi Matsuzaki. ... [The followup] Offend Maggie is head- spinning bliss from beginning to end, and proves that the quartet are the best prog-rock post-punk Afro-Oriental art-pop folk-jazz band in the world. Deerhoof also experiment with contemporary classical music.

It is used when the declarer has enough high cards to take all but one of the remaining tricks, but does not have enough communication between the hands to cash them. It was analyzed and named by Terence Reese in the book \\"The Expert Game\\", also titled \\"Master Play in Contract Bridge\\". The following position is an example of a Stepping-stone squeeze: South has three winners: The K, A, and A. However, after cashing the K, there will be no entry to the North hand to enjoy the A. However, on the play of A, West is squeezed. Discarding a spade allows South to overtake the K to get two tricks in the suit. Throwing the A lets South cash the K. Therefore, West parts with the 3. Now South is able to play the K and lead the K, putting West on lead with only the Q remaining in hand. The name stepping-stone alludes to South's use of West's A to cross over to the abandoned A. This squeeze would work equally well with the East and West hands reversed. An interesting variation is the following ending playing in no trumps with the lead in South: Needing all but one of the remaining tricks, the declarer leads the 10 covered by West, dummy winning with the A. When the winning diamond is led from dummy (declarer throwing a heart) both defenders are subjected to a stepping-stone squeeze. If they both throw spades then declarer cashes the spades in dummy. If one defender keeps two spades then declarer plays a small spade to the J and leads a heart. Now the defender who kept spades wins his stiff honour and must lead a spade to dummy's winner. His partner cannot overtake as this sets up the Q. References * Republications/reprintings by Arnold in 1959 and 1962 and Hale (London) in 1984 and 1990.

The do while construct consists of a process symbol and a condition. First, the code within the block is executed, and then the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true the code within the block is executed again. This repeats until the condition becomes false. Because do while loops check the condition after the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a post-test loop. Contrast with the while loop, which tests the condition before the code within the block is executed, the do-while loop is an exit-condition loop. This means that the code must always be executed first and then the expression or test condition is evaluated. If it is true, the code executes the body of the loop again. This process is repeated as long as the expression evaluates to true. If the expression is false, the loop terminates and control transfers to the statement following the do-while loop. In other words, whereas a while loop sets the truth of a statement as a condition precedent for the code's execution, a do-while loop provides for the action's ongoing execution subject to defeasance by the condition's falsity, which falsity (i.e., the truth of the condition's negation) is set as a condition subsequent. It is possible, and in some cases desirable, for the condition to always evaluate to true, creating an infinite loop. When such a loop is created intentionally, there is usually another control structure (such as a break statement) that allows termination of the loop. Some languages may use a different naming convention for this type of loop. For example, the Pascal language has a \\"repeat until\\" loop, which continues to run until the control expression is true (and then terminates) -- whereas a \\"while\\" loop runs while the control expression is true (and terminates once the expression becomes false). Equivalent constructs do { do_work(); } while (condition); is equivalent to do_work(); while (condition) { do_work(); } In this manner, the do ... while loop saves the initial \\"loop priming\\" with \`do_work();\` on the line before the \`while\` loop. As long as the continue statement is not used, the above is technically equivalent to the following (though these examples are not typical or modern style used in everyday computers): while (true) { do_work(); if (!condition) break; } or LOOPSTART: do_work(); if (condition) goto LOOPSTART; Demonstrating do while loops These example programs calculate the factorial of 5 using their respective languages' syntax for a do-while loop. =ActionScript 3= var counter: int = 5; var factorial: int = 1; do { factorial *= counter--; /* Multiply, then decrement. */ } while (counter > 0); trace(factorial); =Ada= with Ada.Integer_Text_IO; procedure Factorial is Counter : Integer := 5; Factorial : Integer := 1; begin loop Factorial := Factorial * Counter; Counter := Counter - 1; exit when Counter = 0; end loop; Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put (Factorial); end Factorial; =BASIC= Early BASICs (such as GW-BASIC) used the syntax WHILE/WEND. Modern BASICs such as PowerBASIC provide both WHILE/WEND and DO/LOOP structures, with syntax such as DO WHILE/LOOP, DO UNTIL/LOOP, DO/LOOP WHILE, DO/LOOP UNTIL, and DO/LOOP (without outer testing, but with a conditional EXIT LOOP somewhere inside the loop).

In common usage, \\"Woomera\\" also refers to the wider RAAF Woomera Range Complex (WRC), a large Australian Defence Force aerospace and systems testing range covering an area of approximately operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. Woomera township is part of RAAF Base Woomera which, along with the Woomera Test Range (WTR), forms the larger entity known as the Woomera Range Complex (WRC), promulgated by Chief of Air Force (CAF) in June 2014. As at the the Woomera Village had a population of 146, and its usual population varies between 150 and 200 people, yet the village can provide accommodation and services for up to 500 people per day. Although the complex is closed to the public, Woomera Village is open to the public. The location of the Woomera Village can be described as being in the outback desert area of South Australia. It is approximately north-west of Adelaide and is in the State region known as the Far North. There are 27 pastoral stations within the Woomera Prohibited Area, which essentially forms the ground space of the Woomera Test Range, and there are currently four major mines (2013) - Challenger, Prominent Hill, Peculiar Knob, and Cairn Hill. There is also a long-established precious gems (mainly opal) field near the Coober Pedy end of the Stuart Highway which cuts through the middle of the Range. Etymology The settlement draws its name, woomera, from a suggestion from RAAF Group Captain Alfred George Pither and was subsequently chosen by the Board of the Long Range Weapons Establishment in April 1947. The new Village was established on Commonwealth land procured for the purpose, and named after the Aboriginal spear throwing implement the woomera which extends the range a spear can be thrown. History =Establishment= Construction of Woomera Village began in mid-1947 to cater for thousands of people moving there as part of the Anglo-Australian Project. The project lasted for 34 years and saw Woomera become one of the most secret allied establishments in operation during the Cold War. During its heyday (1949‚Äì71), the village population reached around 7,000 as people lived and worked at Woomera and at Koolymilka campsite near Range Head, approximately west of Woomera village within the Woomera Prohibited Area. However, by the end of the 1960s the Anglo-Australian Joint Project was rapidly winding down following the UK Government's reduction in further experimental work. Woomera Village initially operated as a \\"closed town\\" between 1947 and 1982, when the facility supported the operations of the Woomera Rocket Range during the Anglo-Australia Project. Since 1982, the general public has been able to visit and stay at Woomera. However, only Australian Government (mostly Department of Defence) personnel and contractors to the Commonwealth are able to live at Woomera on a permanent basis. The settlement was established in 1947 as a result of the Department of Defence establishment of the adjacent rocket testing range.Explore Australia Woomera Following its construction over 1947‚Äì53, Woomera Village essentially operated under a specialised Commonwealth/Defence township management model rather than a local government (council) model. At the height of its operations (1947‚Äì99), over 7,000 people lived in Woomera Village. To service the needs of the town during this period, the Woomera Board, staffed by members of the Defence community at Woomera elected to the Board by town residents, essentially acted in the role normally provided by a local government council. However, the creation of a Defence Estate management organisation in the 1990s shifted the focus of the Board's activities away from estate and infrastructure management toward principally that of a base welfare organisation supporting the small permanent community and the large number of transit Defence personnel who deploy to Woomera each year. Woomera Village, when originally established, was administered by the Long Range Weapons Establishment (LRWE) under the terms of the 'Anglo- Australian Joint Project'. LRWE was based at to the north of Adelaide city, the site now occupied by Defence Science & Technology Group (DSTG). When the Anglo-Australian Joint Project began to wind down in the early 1970s, the village population began to rapidly drop from its peak of about 7000 residents in the mid-1960s. However, with the establishment of the USAF/ADF Joint Defence Communications Facility in 1969 at the nearby Nurrungar site, approximately south of Woomera, along with its 1100 permanent staff, the village population stabilized at around 4,500 people (including around 800 children). In the late 1990s, as the Nurrungar program was winding down, the ADF reassessed the role of Woomera in its future force structure. What became apparent to the ADF at that time was that the Woomera Test Range was the only land-based test range left in the Western world capable of testing the next (or what is now termed '5th') generation of weapons systems within a fully instrumented, land-based, specialized [test and evaluation] range. This assessment was to result, positively, in redefining the future role and strategic importance of the Woomera Range Complex within Australia's long-term Defence requirements. =Defence facilities= Woomera Village is a Department of Defence-owned and operated facility. RAAF Base Woomera, when it was established in January 2015, also included the RAAF Woomera Airfield, which is approximately north of Woomera Village. The aerodrome lies within the 'Red Zone' of the Woomera Prohibited Area (WPA) and public access to this part of the base is not permitted. Woomera Village, however, is within a \\"Green Zone\\" of the WPA and thus public access to the facilities and services of Woomera, including the several museums located in this historic site, is permitted year round. Visitors may also stay in the Defence operated Eldo Hotel, and there is a privately operated public caravan park at the entrance to Woomera Village. While the WRC operates under the higher management of Woomera Range Headquarters (WRHQ), located at RAAF Base Edinburgh, the operation of the Base itself is co-managed by the RAAF's Combat Support Group (CSG) and Defence Estate & Infrastructure Group (DEIG). CSG focus on the operational aspects of the base's role, while DEIG focuses on ensuring the base's (and the Range's) facilities and general infrastructure remains fit for the purpose it is needed to support the Range's activities. Woomera Village has always been and continues to be the domestic support facility for the Woomera Range Complex. , the WPA covers an area of approximately and forms the essential ground area of the whole Range Complex. The Nurrungar Test Area (NTA) is south of Woomera, and although not within the WPA, it is under the operational control of Woomera Range Headquarters in Adelaide. The WPA is the world's largest land- based instrumented defence systems test and evaluation range facility.Area of WPA was recalculated by Defence in June 2013, pending new legislation, and reduced in size by in November 2014 when Section 400 at Maralinga was officially excised from the WPA and handed back to the traditional owners. Note: The updated area is promulgated on the WPACO website The complex was established in support of the Anglo-Australian Joint Project. This cold-war project focussed on the development of long-range weapons systems, principally to counter the growing intercontinental ballistic missile threat from the former Soviet Union. The cold-war heyday of the Range was 1947 to about 1972. In 1980 the Anglo-Australia Project was closed and the range itself saw little use until about 1991 when the RAAF's Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) took over the old instrumented range from Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). Since that time, the RAAF has gradually assumed full control of the entire facility. The complex today is much smaller than it was in 1947, but still covers one-seventh of South Australia. Although there are now several major mines established within the WPA, the Woomera support base is the only permanently established township facility in the WPA. Officially, the village area is referred to as 'Base Sector South' of RAAF Base Woomera, and like the RAAF Base at Point Cook in Victoria, this part of the complex is open to public access. This is principally so that tourists can access the significant historical displays and museums which cover the range's air and space activities since its establishment in 1947. At the Woomera Heritage Centre, there are also displays covering the Indigenous and Pioneer heritage of the region. In particular, there is a dedicated section on Len Beadell who became something of an outback legend as an army surveyor (1947‚Äì48) and road builder (1953‚Äì63). There is also a memorial cairn for Len Beadell and his wife Anne in the nearby Woomera Cemetery. At the , the village had 146 permanent residents, whereas the operation of the complex may be up to an additional 500‚Äì700 personnel per day. Public visitors (estimated at in excess of 70,000 per annum) generally find Woomera village to be a very quiet place. Principally this is due to the fact that the base is essentially the dinner, bed, and breakfast facility for Defence personnel. Today the complex embraces a much wider range of Defence systems technology and tactics testing and evaluation activities. In terms of space activities only a small number of sub-orbital sounding rocket tests are conducted. In June 2010, however, Woomera hosted the return of the Hayabusa Deep Space Probe. This was the first planned space re-entry to Australian soil and created another milestone for the Range. Settlement history =Nurrungar project= In 1969, as the Anglo-Australia Project was winding down, the United States Air Force (USAF) began construction and installation of the Nurrungar Joint Tracking Facility. This facility was located approximately south of Woomera. Over the next 30 years, this project ensured the maintenance of Woomera village infrastructure, with improvements and modernization of facilities. During the period of operations, around 1,100 USAF and ADF personnel and their families were accommodated at Woomera, and the population was around 4,000. =The new era of Woomera= When the Nurrungar Project came to an end in 1999, the future of the village looked bleak. However, the RAAF was set to take over the range following a long-term study of Defence needs through to 2035, which found that the Woomera Test Range was the only test and evaluation range left in the western world capable of testing the next generation of ADF defence systems within its land borders ‚Äì and it could be utilized all year round given its climatic advantages. Additionally, the Federal Government decided to establish several immigration detention centres around the country to deal with a growing number of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers arriving by sea, and Woomera was chosen as a site for such a facility. The establishment of the Woomera Immigration Detention Centre in 1999, through the refurbishment of the original Woomera Village construction camp at 'Woomera West', eventually brought in new permanent staff (as the Nurrungar people were leaving) to settle and maintain the village population at around 1,200. The immigration detention centre, however, proved to be a highly controversial facility and it closed in early 2003 after only about 36 months of operation, at which point the land and buildings were handed back to the Defence Department. =Camp Rapier= Following the closure of the Immigration Detention Centre, and the return of the site to the ADF, Woomera West was redesigned, altered, and re- established as a secure defence garrison support facility and renamed 'Camp Rapier'. It is now frequently used by the Australian Army and squadrons of the RAAF's Airfield Defence Guards as a base camp for specialized training and testing activities. It also has had a detachment of Australian Air Force Cadets from South Australia stay there. =Post-2003= Post-2003, the village population stabilized at about 400, but has subsequently dropped to around 150‚Äì200. When the RAAF assumed operational command of Woomera in 1999, there was an increase in the number of temporary residents associated with the conduct of test and evaluation activities on the range. In 2009 Woomera village was the largest ADF domestic base support facility in Australia, and the village is open to public access. There is a high visitation rate by tourists to view the National Missile Park in the centre of the village (which features aircraft, rockets, bombs and missiles covering the full period of the Range's operations), the Woomera Heritage Centre (which features an introductory audio visual presentation and an interpretive gallery that tells the story of this site), and the Community Museum that is maintained by the village's volunteer community board and which is located within the missile park precinct. Generally, the residents of Woomera are defence workers or contractors. There are no privately owned homes in the village although some are leased to agencies such as the Bureau of Meteorology. The facilities in the village include a gym, hotel, swimming pool, hospital, cinema, school, two museums and missile park. There is also a supermarket, radio station, post office, bowling alley, a football sports club, Returned Services League and Bowling Club. Under the management of the Defence Support and Reform Group (DSRG), a contractor delivers the base's garrison support services to the RAAF. These services include care and maintenance of the base and range infrastructure, messing, accommodation and operational support to trials activities on the Range. Climate Woomera has an arid climate with hot, dry summers and cool, mostly dry winters. Woomera village today The population of Woomera is about 136 permanent residents. However, this number can quadruple with the passage of personnel moving in and out of the base as part of range trials activities. 40 years ago the people who conducted the trials also lived at Woomera, however, with modern communications technology only the people who provide the range support services now need to live at Woomera. Annually, a total of about 5,000 to 6,000 people deploy to Woomera to conduct tests, trials and training activities at the Range. The management of the Range's infrastructure is the responsibility of Defence Support and Reform Group (DSRG), but the Woomera Board is a long-standing and integral part of the base's local support network. The Woomera Board is composed of five elected members from the village's permanent residents, and four members who are appointed by the current Base Support Manager. The aim of the Woomera Board is to build the sense of community, given its remote location. The Board also prints a weekly news letter - Gibber Gabber.\\\\- See issues of the Gibber Gabber here: http://www.woomera.com.au/community/gibber_gabber.htm The base is located in the Woomera Prohibited Area (WPA) and it is an RAAF establishment. However, similar to the RAAF Base at Point Cook, Woomera is open to the visiting public. Non-Defence visitors to Woomera are able to stay at the 'Eldo Hotel' which offers 400 beds in a varying range of formats. The hotel reception, including the \\"Oasis\\" bar and restaurant, is located in the former Eldo administration facility. Rooms are generally located close to the main hotel facility and some blocks have names such as \\"Redstone\\", \\"Black Knight\\", \\"Blue Steel\\" and \\"Skylark\\" - all former rocket or missile systems once tested at Woomera. The nearby \\"Traveller's Village Caravan Park\\" is a privately operated venture centered around the old \\"senior ranks' mess\\" facility at the entrance to the base from the main road. It mostly services the motor home and backpacker travellers passing through Woomera.http://www.woomera.com.au/tourism.htm Tourism Northern section of Missile Park Woomera's attractions include the Woomera National Aerospace and Missile Park, located in the centre of the village. This park features missiles and rockets that were developed and tested at Woomera over the last 60 years, as well as a number of aircraft which were used in trials at Woomera. The Woomera Heritage Centre, which was the former recreation centre for USAF personnel and their families from Nurrungar, features a cafe, a tenpin bowling alley (which was installed by the US Air Force personnel in the 1990s and is still in good working order), a modern interactive display and interpretive centre covering the full life of the Range, a souvenir shop, and a significant display of regional history. This display also features the story of legendary Len Beadell, the famous surveyor who laid out the original range across vast tracts of the Australian Outback stretching from Woomera to the North-West coast of Western Australia. Next to Missile Park, there is a museum featuring range artifacts and the activities and people who lived and worked at Woomera in the early years. This museum is located in one of four former churches which existed in Woomera. Other attractions include a movie theatre (but movie screenings may be infrequent), swimming centre, a well stocked general store and bottle shop, along with two main clubs which offer counter meals on a Thursday (RSL Club) and Friday (Sports Club) nights. Woomera is a haven for observing and understanding Australia's desert flora and fauna, and there is an observatory which operates one night a week or by appointment. The historic precinct of the town attracts a large number of visitors each year to view the many local attractions including the Missile Park, Heritage Centre, History Museum and other attractions such as Butement Square, the Eldo Hotel (formerly the headquarters for European Launch Development Organisation), and the local observatory. Approximately 65,000 tourists a year visit Woomera, with about half of that number going on to visit Roxby Downs (location of the BHP Olympic Dam Mine).

Founded in 1978 to provide degrees in programs not yet offered in the southeast of the United States, the university now operates two locations in Georgia, a degree- granting online education program, and a study abroad location in Lacoste, France. The university enrolls more than 14,000 students from across the United States and around the world with international students comprising up to 17 percent of the student population. SCAD is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges and other professional accrediting bodies. History Richard G. Rowan, Paula S. Wallace, May L. Poetter and Paul E. Poetter legally incorporated the Savannah College of Art and Design September 29, 1978. In September 1979, the university first began offering classes with four staff members, seven faculty members, and 71 students. Initially, the school offered eight majors: ceramics, graphic design, historic preservation, textile design, interior design, painting, photography, and printmaking. In May 1981, the first graduate received a degree. The following year, the first graduating class received degrees. In 1982, the enrollment grew to more than 500 students, then to 1,000 in 1986, and 2,000 in 1989. In 2014, the university enrolled more than 11,000 students. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a rash of faculty suicides prompted a nervous reaction from school administrators. The unrest led a competing art school to open downtown, igniting an \\"all-out war.\\" Student unrest grew in the early 1990s regarding student representation within the school, culminating in 1992 with the detonation of an explosive device at the administration building, and two more later that year, at the Savannah Civic Center. SCAD opened a study abroad location in Lacoste, France in 2002 that provides programming for the various academic departments offered by the university's degree-granting locations. It launched an online learning program in 2003 that U.S. News and World Report ranks as among the best for bachelor's programs in the nation. In 2005 the university opened a location in Midtown Atlanta that merged with the Atlanta College of Art in 2006. In September 2010, SCAD opened a Hong Kong location in the Sham Shui Po district. Ivy Hall houses classrooms for SCAD's Atlanta campus Richard Rowan served as president of the college from its inception in 1978 until April 2000, when SCAD's board of trustees promoted him to chancellor. As chancellor, Rowan spent most of his time traveling and recruiting international students and staff. In 2001, he resigned the job and left the college. Paula S. Wallace is the current president. Wallace, formerly Paula S. Rowan, served as SCAD's provost and dean of academics before becoming president. As president, Wallace directs the internal management of the institution. Wallace has led the collaboration for several annual events, such as the Sidewalk Arts Festival, Savannah Film Festival, a Fashion Show, SCAD Style, deFine Art Festival, Art Educators' Forum and Rising Star. Questions have been raised about the unusual pay packages granted to Wallace and her family. Paula Wallace received $9.6 million in compensation in 2014, and 13 members of her family have received $60 million over the past 20 years. In 2014, publicist Bobby Zarem claimed he was fired from the SCAD-run Savannah Film Festival for being a whistleblower on campus sexual assault. Zarem alleged that four women informed him they were assaulted on campus, and that school president Paula Wallace launched a cover- up of these incidents, which cover-up was denied by SCAD. The university's second museum, SCAD FASH Museum of Fashion + Film, opened in 2015, at SCAD Atlanta. In 2018, a student started a petition calling for better mental health services for students after two suicides occurred after the beginning of the 2018 academic year. In 2019, SCAD increased the number of professional counseling staff and created Bee Well, which provides virtual and physical counseling, wellness workshops, and a 24/7 toll-free emotional support hotline. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCAD transitioned to entirely virtual learning for all students, while allowing international students and others to remain in residence halls following social distancing protocols. In June 2020, SCAD discontinued studies at its Hong Kong location, citing concerns about student safety and academic quality following the 2019 Hong Kong Protests and the COVID-19 pandemic. The North Kowloon Magistracy will be returned to the city. In June 2020, in the midst of Black Lives Matter protests around the U.S., SCAD created an office of inclusion and announced related initiatives to address systemic racism, including the addition of 15 endowed scholarships for black students. Campus Poetter Hall, originally Preston Hall, was SCAD's first building and first historic restoration project. =Facilities= SCAD's efforts to work with the city of Savannah to preserve its architectural heritage include restoring buildings for use as college facilities, for which it has been recognized by the American Institute of Architects, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Historic Savannah Foundation and the Victorian Society of America. The college campus includes 67 buildings throughout the grid-and-park system of downtown Savannah. Many buildings are on the famous 21 squares of the old town, which are laden with monuments, live oaks and a Southern-Gothic feel. Located in Atlanta's Midtown, SCAD Atlanta includes classroom and exhibition space, computer labs, library, photography darkrooms, printmaking and sculpture studios, a dining hall, fitness center, swimming pool and residence hall. SCAD Atlanta's Ivy Hall opened in 2008 after extensive restoration. In 2009, SCAD Atlanta opened the Digital Media Center. Cylinder press in the Atelier de Gravure at SCAD LacosteThe SCAD Lacoste campus is made up of 15th- and 16th-century structures. The campus includes an art gallery, guest houses, computer lab and printmaking lab. In Hong Kong, SCAD occupies renovated historic North Kowloon Magistracy Building, with more than . It is equipped with classrooms, meeting areas, computer labs, an art gallery and library. The college's first academic building was the Savannah Volunteer Guard Armory, which was purchased and renovated in 1978‚Äì79. Built in 1892, the Romanesque Revival red brick structure is included on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally named Preston Hall, the building was renamed Poetter Hall in honor of co-founders May and Paul Poetter. SCAD soon expanded rapidly, acquiring buildings in Savannah's downtown historic and Victorian districts, restoring old and often derelict buildings that had exhausted their original functions. Bergen Hall The College operates four libraries: Jen Library in Savannah, Georgia; ACA Library in Atlanta, Georgia; Hong Kong Library in Hong Kong; and Lacoste Library in Lacoste, France. There is also a large amount of resources available via the eLearning Library. The most notable of the group is Jen Library for the size of its collection. The Jen Library houses approximately 42,000 books, 11,000 bound volumes of periodicals, and 1,600 videotapes in an 85,000 square foot building. The building, itself, once served as a Maas Brothers department store before being acquired and repurposed by the University. Its structural and design features include a large glass staircase and floor-to-ceiling windows on opposite corners of the building. The Jen Library houses multiple rare collections containing both books and visual arts materials including the Don Bluth Collection of Animation and the Newton Collection of British and American Art. It is also home to the Gutstein Gallery, an assemblage of contemporary art from both nationally recognized artists as well as SCAD alumni. =Student housing= In Atlanta the university provides three residence halls, ACA Residence Hall of SCAD, Brookwood Courtyard, and the Forty. The Hong Kong residence hall is the Hong Kong Gold Coast residences. The residence halls in Savannah are Barnard Village, Boundary Village, Montgomery House, Oglethorpe House, Pulaski House, Turner House, Turner House Annex, and the Hive student housing complex, consisting of Apiary, Bumble, Colony, Dance, Everest, Flower, Garden and Honey at The Hive. Students also live at Walden at Chatham Center. Students in Lacoste live in Maison Pitot, Fortunee, Renard, Murier, Olivier, and Basse. =Museums and galleries= SCAD operates museums, galleries, and exhibition spaces across its campuses, including the SCAD Museum of Art, located on the site of the former Central of Georgia Railway headquarters in Savannah, Georgia, and SCAD FASH Museum of Fashion + Film in Atlanta, Georgia. University galleries include Gutstein Gallery, Pei Ling Chan Gallery, Pinnacle Gallery and La Galerie Bleue in Savannah; Gallery 1600, Trois Gallery and Gallery See in Atlanta; and Moot Gallery in Hong Kong. Academics Montgomery Hall is home of Animation, Broadcast Design and Motion Graphics, Interactive Design and Game Development, and Visual EffectsSCAD offers fine art degrees. In Fall 2019, SCAD enrolled more than 14,840 students (12,167 undergraduates; 2,673 postgraduates) from all 50 states, and more than 110 countries. Currently, International student enrollment is 17 percent. =Accreditation= SCAD is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award bachelor's and master's degrees.

Everywhere all the time: A new deschooling reader. AK Press. and was published in Boston, Massachusetts. Reportedly the first such publication in the United States, it was read worldwide, and helped to catalyze the early growth and development of the homeschooling movement. Publication ceased in 2001 after 143 issues due to financial problems. Content and philosophy The newsletter included letters with questions and advice about homeschooling, interviews with participants in homeschooling, directories of resources, news items, and analysis. One common feature addressed challenges homeschooling families face, such as legal hurdles, skeptical grandparents, the need for parents to relearn material, and balancing homeschooling with other work for parents. Space was also devoted to connecting people with people in similar positions, such as observant Jewish homeschooling families, single parents interested in homeschooling, and parents of children with intellectual disabilities.Growing Without School issues 4, 5, 6, 77, 117, 143 Many articles criticized schools. These criticisms expressed concerns that schools stifle student motivation and creativity, interfere with learning, mistreat students with disabilities, maintain class hierarchy, and monopolize resources that would be better invested in libraries, museums and community centers.  Leadership  Following Holt's death in 1985, Holt Associates took over the newsletter. Susannah Sheffer and Patrick Farenga served as editor and publisher respectively. Meredith Collins later served as editor.  Legacy  One of the first documentaries about homeschooling, Grown Without Schooling, was named in homage to the magazine and profiled several of the grown homeschoolers who had written for it. Its producer, Peter Kowalke, also wrote occasionally for the magazine. Everywhere All the Time: A New Deschooling Reader, edited by Matt Hern and published in 2008, includes a chapter on Growing without Schooling.

In 1954, Chrysler Corporation disclosed the development and successful road testing of a production model Plymouth sport coupe which was powered by a turbine engine. Development Experimental and test engines were first operated in 1954. George Huebner and his group of research engineers were convinced that the engine was a viable project. It had challenges like fuel consumption had to be in the same range as standard reciprocating engines, components needed to be reduced in size and increased in efficiency, noise had to be reduced, acceleration time lag needed to be reduced and engine braking had to be introduced into the overall function. Additionally, new high-temperature materials needed to be developed, yet be inexpensive enough to keep the vehicle cost the equivalent of other vehicles of the time. The benefits of turbine engines as explained by Chrysler engineers were reduced maintenance, longer engine life expectancy, large development potential, overall parts reduction of approximately 80% (60 parts rather than 300), requirements for tune ups nearly eliminated, low temperature starting difficulties eliminated and no warm up needed, antifreeze is not required, interior heat is available instantly in winter, no engine stalling with sudden overload, engine operates without vibration, oil consumption is negligible, reduced engine weight, exhaust gases are cool and less pollutant, and most importantly, a wide range of combustible fuels may be employed as a replacement for petroleum gasoline. Testing The first successful test of a gas turbine engine in a car (CR1) took place in 1954 at Chrysler's testing grounds. In 1956, the first successful cross-country trip using a turbine- engined car took place. Further engineering work resulted in the second generation (CR2), which improved fuel economy and increased horsepower. In 1961, a third-generation engine (CR2A) was installed in a 1962 Dodge Dart, which successfully drove from New York City to Los Angeles, through snowstorms, rain and heavy winds. The fourth-generation engine, installed in the Chrysler Turbine Car, was put into use in 1963. This engine runs at up to 44,500 revolutions per minute, according to the owner's manual, and could operate using diesel fuel, unleaded gasoline, kerosene, JP-4 jet fuel, and even vegetable oil. The engine can run on virtually anything with combustible properties and \\"Chrysler claimed the turbine could gulp everything from peanut oil to Chanel No. 5.\\" The then-incumbent President of Mexico tested this theory by running one of the first cars‚Äîsuccessfully‚Äîon tequila, after Chrysler engineers confirmed that the car would operate successfully. No air/fuel adjustments are required to switch from one fuel type to another and the only evidence of which fuel was used is the odor of the exhaust. The turbine spins on simple sleeve bearings for vibration-free running. Its simplicity offers the potential for long life, and because no combustion contaminants enter engine oil, no oil changes are considered necessary. The 1963 Turbine's engine generated and an instant of torque at stall speed, making it good for 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 12 seconds at an ambient temperature of ‚Äîit can sprint quicker if the ambient air was cooler and denser. The lack of many moving parts and the lack of liquid coolant eases maintenance, while the exhaust does not contain carbon monoxide, unburned carbon, or raw hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, the turbine generates nitrogen oxides and the challenge of limiting them proved an ongoing problem throughout development. The power turbine is connected, without a torque converter, through a gear reduction unit to an only moderately modified TorqueFlite automatic transmission. The flow of the combustion gases between the gas generator and free power turbine provides the same functionality as a torque converter but without using a conventional liquid medium. Twin rotating recuperators transfer exhaust heat to the inlet air, greatly improving fuel economy. Varying stator blades prevent excessive top end speeds, and provide engine braking on deceleration. Throttle lag and exhaust gas temperatures at idle plagued generations 1 and 2; Chrysler was able to remedy or mitigate these to some degree. Acceleration lag, however, remained a problem, and fuel consumption was excessive, although it improved with each generation. Acceleration was excellent provided the turbine was spun up (by applying power) prior to releasing the brakes. The Turbine Car also featured a fully stainless steel exhaust system, the exits of which were flat in cross section. This was intended to spread the exhaust gases thinly and thus cool them further, in order to allow the vehicle to stand in traffic without risking damage to following traffic. The combustor, or burner, was primitive by the standards of modern turbojet engines. A single reverse-flow canister featuring a more-or-less standard spark plug for ignition was employed. Had the engine been further developed, annular combustion chambers along with a second power turbine might have improved power and economy even more. The transmission has an \\"idle\\" position instead of \\"neutral\\". After the user testing period completed, Chrysler collected all of the cars, destroying 40 out of the original 50 Chrysler kept 2,then sending the remaining examples to museums. Later development and project end Chrysler's turbine engine program did not end with the Chrysler Turbine Car. A new coupe body, which was to become the 1966 Dodge Charger was considered for a new fifth-generation turbine engine. However, Chrysler went on to develop a sixth generation gas-turbine engine which finally met US nitrogen oxide regulations, and installed it in a 1966 Dodge Coronet, though it was never introduced to the public. A smaller, lighter, seventh generation engine was produced in the early 1970s, when the company received a grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for further development, and a one-off, special bodied, turbine Chrysler LeBaron was built in 1977 as a prelude to a production run. However, by 1978 the company was encountering significant financial difficulties and new CEO Lee Iacocca needed U.S. government loan guarantees to avoid bankruptcy. A government condition of that 1979 deal was that the gas-turbine program be abandoned because they believed it was \\"too risky\\" for an auto company of Chrysler's size. While Chrysler's work with turbine engines never paid off in the retail automobile sector, the experiments proved fruitful with the incorporation of a Honeywell AGT1500 into a slightly different product, the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank, developed in the late 1970s by Chrysler Defense (which was later sold to General Dynamics).

Between 1941 and 1945 he was Chief of Civil Administration (Chef der Zivilverwaltung) of Bezirk Bialystok. During this period, he was also the Reichskommissar in Reichskommissariat Ukraine from September 1941 until August 1944 and in Reichskommissariat Ostland from September 1944. After the Second World War, Koch stood trial in Poland and was convicted in 1959 of war crimes and sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment a year later. Early life and First World War  Koch was born in Elberfeld, today part of Wuppertal, as the son of foreman Gustav Adolf Koch (1862 - 1932) and his wife Henriette, n√©e Matthes (1863 - 1939). In World War I he served without distinction as a soldier from 1915 to the end of the war in 1918. He later fought as a member of Freikorps Rossbach in Upper Silesia.Robert S. Wistrich, Who's who in Nazi Germany, pp. 142-143. A skilled trader, Koch joined the railway service as an aspirant for the middle level of the civil service. He was dismissed from this position in 1926 for anti-republican activities. Rise in the Nazi Party Koch joined the NSDAP in 1922 (member #90). From 1922 he worked in various party positions in the NSDAP-Gau Ruhr. During the Occupation of the Ruhr, he was a member of Albert Leo Schlageter's group and was imprisoned several times by the French authorities. In 1927 he became Bezirksf√ºhrer of the NSDAP in Essen and later the deputy Gauleiter of Gau Ruhr. Koch belonged to the left wing of the party and was a supporter of the faction led by Gregor Strasser. In 1928 Koch became Gauleiter of the Province of East Prussia and the leader of the NSDAP faction in the provincial diet. From September 1930 he was a member of the Reichstag for East Prussia. After the Machtergreifung (\\"Seizure of power\\"), Koch was appointed to the Prussian State Council in July 1933. He became Oberpr√§sident of East Prussia on 2 June 1933 (acting until September) replacing Wilhelm Kutscher. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the province. In November 1938 Koch was appointed SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer. =Gauleiter of East Prussia= Koch's pre-war rule in East Prussia was characterized by efforts to collectivize the local agriculture and ruthlessness in dealing with his critics inside and outside the Party. He also had long-term plans for mass-scale industrialization of the largely agricultural province. These actions made him unpopular among the local peasants. However, through publicly funded emergency relief programs concentrating on agricultural land-improvement projects and road construction, the \\"Erich Koch Plan\\" for East Prussia allegedly made the province free of unemployment; on August 16, 1933 Koch reported to Hitler that unemployment had been banished entirely from East Prussia, a feat that gained admiration throughout the Reich. Koch's industrialization plans led him into conflict with Richard Walther Darr√©, who held the office of the Reich Peasant Leader (Reichsbauernf√ºhrer) and Minister of Agriculture. Darr√©, a neopaganist rural romantic, wanted to enforce his vision of an agricultural East Prussia. When his \\"Land\\" representatives challenged Koch's plans, Koch had them arrested.Richard Steigmann-Gall, The Holy Reich - Nazi Conceptions of Christianity 1919-1945, p. 102. Second World War Erich Koch (right) and Alfred Rosenberg (center) in Kiev, Reichskommissariat Ukraine At the commencement of World War II Koch was appointed Reich Defence Commissioner (Reichsverteidigungskommissar) for East Prussia (Military District I). On 26 October 1939, after the end of the Invasion of Poland, he was transferred from East Prussia to the new Reichsgau Westpreu√üen, later renamed to Danzig-West Prussia. East Prussia was compensated with Regierungsbezirk Zichenau (previously Ciechan√≥w). These new areas lay approximately between the rivers Vistula and Narew. In March 1940 Theodor Schieder, who was director in charge of Regional Office for Postwar History (Landesstelle fur Nachkriegsgeschichte), presented Gauleiter Erich Koch with a detailed plan regarding studies of territories annexed to East Prussia; Koch himself wanted to know political, social and ethnic conditions in those areas. Schieder in return sent two reports to Koch, including a population inventory conducted at the end of 19th century of the area in question, which was most relevant to Nazi policies of extermination and settlement, and provided basis for segregation of Jewish and \\"Slavic\\" spouses from ethnic Germans in the German Volksliste.Ingo Haar, Michael Fahlbusch, German scholars and ethnic cleansing, 1919-1945, Berghahn Books, 2006, pp. 14, 18 Soon after the invasion of the Soviet Union, Koch was appointed \\"civil commissioner\\" (Zivilkommissar) on 1 August 1941, and later as Chief of Civil Administration in Bezirk Bialystok. In 1942 Gauleiter Erich Koch expressed thanks to Theodor Schieder for his help in Nazi operations in annexed Poland writing: \\"As a director of 'Landesstelle Ostpreu√üen f√ºr Nachkriegsgeschichte' you have provided material that provided significant service in our fight against Poles and continues to help us in establishing new order today in Regierungsbezirke Zichenau and Bialystok.\\"Macht - Geist - Wahn: Kontinuit√§ten deutschen Denkens G√∂tz Aly page 175 Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, 1999 On 1 September 1941, Koch became Reichskommissar of Reichskommissariat Ukraine with control of the Gestapo and the uniformed police. His domain now extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea; it comprised ethnic German, Polish, Belarus and Ukrainian areas. As Reichskommissar he had full authority in his realm, which led into conflict with other elements of the Nazi bureaucracy. Alfred Rosenberg, Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories (Reichsministerium f√ºr die besetzten Ostgebiete), expressed his disapproval of Koch's autonomous actions to Hitler in December 1941. Koch's first act as Reichskommissar was to close local schools, declaring that \\"Ukraine children need no schools. What they'll have to learn will be taught them by their German masters.\\" His brutality is best exemplified by his remark, \\"If I meet a Ukrainian worthy of being seated at my table, I must have him shot.\\"Norman Davies: Europe at War, Macmillan, 2006. Koch worked together with the General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment (Generalbevollm√§chtigter f√ºr den Arbeitseinsatz) Fritz Sauckel in providing the Reich with forced labor. He was also involved in the persecution of Polish and Ukrainian Jews. Due to his brutal actions, Nazi rule in Ukraine was disturbed by a growing number of partisan uprisings. Statements about the Germans as a Herrenvolk (master race) belong to the Nazi officials of various ranks. In particular when Reichskommissar Ukraine Erich Koch said: On 21 September 1944, Koch succeeded Hinrich Lohse as Reichskommissar for the Ostland, overseeing the Nazi administration in the Baltic States. Koch was appointed as head of the Volkssturm of East Prussia on 25 November 1944. As the Red Army advanced into his area during 1945, Koch initially fled K√∂nigsberg to Berlin at the end of January after condemning the Wehrmacht from attempting a similar breakout from East Prussia. He then returned to the far safer town of Pillau, \\"where he made a great show of organizing the marine evacuation using Kriegsmarine radio communications, before once more getting away himself\\"Antony Beevor, The Fall of Berlin: 1945, p. 50 by escaping through this Baltic Sea port on 23 April 1945 on the icebreaker Ostpreu√üen. From Pillau through Hel Peninsula, R√ºgen, and Copenhagen he arrived at Flensburg, where he hid himself after unsuccessfully demanding that a U-boat take him to South America.Ian Kershaw, The End: The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1944-1945, p. 319 He was captured by British forces in Hamburg in May 1949. Trial and imprisonment Erich Koch during his trial in Poland The Soviet Union demanded Koch's extradition, but the British government decided to pass him on to the Polish government instead. On 14 January 1950 he was handed over by the British to a prison in Warsaw, the Mokot√≥w Prison, where he remained imprisoned for another eight years before his trial began on 19 October 1958. He faced charges of war crimes for the extermination of 400,000 Poles, but was never indicted for his crimes in Ukraine. Found guilty of these crimes, he was sentenced to death on 9 March 1959 by the district court in Warsaw for having planned, prepared and organized the mass murder of civilians. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment due to ill health, although many believe he was spared because the Soviets thought he possessed information about art looted by the Nazis during the war; in particular, information about the whereabouts of the Amber Room of Tsarskoye Selo palace near Leningrad which was dismantled on Koch's direct orders. The Soviets believed he had ordered parts of this famous room to be hidden on board the Wilhelm Gustloff cruise liner, which was torpedoed and sunk by the Soviets in the Baltic whilst evacuating German refugees from East Prussia in early 1945.Lucas, Last Days of the Reich, p. 27 Salvage attempts by both Soviet and Polish diving teams in the 1950s revealed no evidence to substantiate this theory. Koch appeared in a television report on K√∂nigsberg's history in 1986, interviewed by West German journalists in his Polish prison cell. He remained unrepentant to the end, arguing that he would never have surrendered as \\"it was a matter of honour\\". He died shortly thereafter of natural causes in Barczewo prison, Poland (formerly Wartenburg in East Prussia) at the age of 90, as the last war criminal to serve a term in Poland. He was buried in an unmarked grave, at the local prison cemetery. Koch and Christianity Koch was one of only a few openly Christian Nazi party members.Richard Steigmann-Gall, The Holy Reich - Nazi conceptions of Christianity 1919-1945, pp. 1-2. In addition to his political career, Koch was also the elected praeses of Synod of the old-Prussian Ecclesiastical Province of East Prussia. Although Koch gave preference to the Deutsche Christen movement over traditional Protestantism, his contemporaries regarded Koch as a bona fide Christian, whose success in his church career could be attributed to his commitment to the Lutheran faith. Koch officially resigned his church membership in 1943, but in his post-war testimony he stated: \\"I held the view that the Nazi idea had to develop from a basic Prussian-Protestant attitude and from Luther's unfinished Protestant Reformation\\". On the 450th Anniversary of Luther's birth (10 November 1933), Koch spoke on the circumstances surrounding Luther's birthday. He implied that the Machtergreifung was an act of divine will and stated that both Luther and Hitler struggled in the name of belief. It has been speculated that Koch's conflicts with Rosenberg and Darr√© had a religious element to them; both Rosenberg and Darr√© were anti-Christian Nordicists who did not believe that the Nazi Weltanschauung (\\"world view\\") was compatible with Christianity.

The process of housebreaking or house-training requires patience and consistence from the human. Accidents are a part of the process and reacting negatively could discourage the animal, and slow down the training as a whole.  Dogs  The first step in housebreaking or house-training a new puppy is creating a routine or schedule. Young puppies aren't able to control their bladder as well as older dogs and should be taken out frequently. A general rule of thumb to follow is that puppies can hold their bladder one hour for every month; if a puppy is two months they can hold their urine for around two hours. When taking the puppy outside their owner should take them to a designated spot every time. Using a word as they excrete, such as \\"outside\\" or \\"bathroom,\\" can be used as a way to remind the puppy what to do in the future once they are trained. Rewarding the puppy after they are done excreting helps the puppy recognize outdoors is the proper place to urinate and defecate. Crate training should be used when the human isn't able to take the dog out within its scheduled time. The crate should be big enough for the puppy to be comfortable, but small enough for them to not want to excrete inside of the crate.  Cats  The process of housebreaking or house-training a kitten is vastly different from doing so for a puppy. Rather than a designated area outside, the designated area is indoors within a litter box. A cat's instinct is to excrete within a substrate, and then scratch and dig to hide the excretion; litter boxes support this natural behavior. There are a variety of options for what substrate (or litter) to put within a litter box but most veterinarians agree a scent-free clumping clay substrate is what cats prefer. It is important to pick the right litter box whether it be smaller, bigger, have high walls, or if there should be a lid. In addition to what kind of litter box, location of the litter box matters. The litter box should be located in a quiet area so the kitten feels comfortable enough to use it whenever it pleases. A cat prefers its litter box to be in a quiet, undisturbed area of the home In the beginning, the kitten should be placed in the box, to learn where it is and what the substrate feels like. The kitten should be placed in the box again after it has eaten as that is when the urge to excrete is the strongest. Most kittens take to litter boxes immediately if the substrate is to their liking. All cats have different preferences and some may prefer separate litter boxes for urine and feces.

They were one of the founding members of the Rock in Opposition (RIO) movement in the late 1970s. In 1979 they were Fred Frith's backing band on his solo album, Gravity (1980). Musically, they bore a resemblance to the Canterbury scene. The original line-up was Lars Hollmer (keyboards), Hasse Bruniusson (drums), Lars Krantz (bass) and Henrik √ñberg (percussion). For M√•ltid, jazz fusion guitarist Coste Apetrea joined the group. They were on the fringe of the Swedish political \\"progg\\" movement, although their lyrics were humorous and not explicitly political. The title of the album Klossa Knapitatet is a play on the Swedish phrase krossa kapitalet, a common slogan in the 1970s that means \\"crush the capital\\", and also the title of a seminal progg song by Bl√• T√•get, called \\"Staten och Kapitalet (Den ena handen vet vad den andra g√∂r)\\". Some more serious elements of the progg movement were not amused by this frivolous attitude. The band underwent line-up and name changes over the years (they released albums as Zamla Mammaz Manna and von Zamla), reinventing their sound each time. In 1999, the band reformed under their original name for a one-off release entitled Kaka. In 2002 they reunited again, this time with Japanese musician Tatsuya Yoshida on drums, for some performances and their final album Dear Mamma. The band played their first concerts in the US in August 2003, in Chicago at Schuba's, and at the annual Progday festival in North Carolina. In 2005 the band opened the international progressive rock festival that took place in Moscow, Russia, InProg 2005. Hollmer died in December 2008.

The area lies in present-day Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang, China; Kuqa town is the county seat of that prefecture's Kuqa County. Its population was given as 74,632 in 1990.  Etymology  The history of toponyms for modern Kucha remain somewhat problematic, although it is clear that Kucha, Kuchar (in Turkic languages) and Kuch√© (modern Chinese),Elias (1895), p. 124, n. 1. correspond to the Kushan of Indic scripts from late antiquity. While Chinese transcriptions of the Han or the Tang infer that K√ºch√Ø was the original form of the name, Guzan (or K√ºsan), is attested in the Old Tibetan Annals (s.v.), dating from 687 CE. Uighur and Chinese transcriptions from the period of the Mongol Empire support the forms K√ºs√§n/G√ºs√§n and Kuxian/Quxian respectively, Yuanshi, chap. 12, fol 5a, 7a. rather than K√ºsh√§n or Kushan. Another, cognate Chinese transliteration is Ku- sien. Transcriptions of the name Kushan in Indic scripts from late antiquity include the spelling Gu·π£√¢n, and are apparently reflected in at least one Khotanese-Tibetan transcription. The forms K≈´sƒÅn and K≈´s are attested in the 16th century work Tarikh-i-Rashidi.cf. Elias and Ross, Tarikh-i-Rashidi, in the index, s.v. Kuchar and Kusan: \\"One MS. [of the Tarikh-i-Rashidi] reads Kus/Kusan. Both names, as well as Kos, Kucha, Kujar etc., were used for modern Kucha.

While ÈæúÁéÜ has sometimes been romanized as Qiuzi (or Wade-Giles: Ch'iu-tzu), this is generally regarded as incorrect; the second character is more properly represented as ci (Wade-Giles: tz'u).Hill (2015), Vol. I, p. 121, note 1.30. History =Kingdom= According to the Book of Han (completed in 111 CE), Kucha was the largest of the \\"Thirty-six Kingdoms of the Western Regions\\", with a population of 81,317, including 21,076 persons able to bear arms. For a long time, Kucha was the most populous oasis in the Tarim Basin. As a Central Asian metropolis, it was part of the Silk Road economy, and was in contact with the rest of Central Asia, including Sogdiana and Bactria, and thus also with the cultures of South Asia, Iran, and coastal areas of China. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang visited Kucha and in the 630s described Kucha at some length, and the following are excerpts from his descriptions of Kucha: Dali coins founded in Kucha A specific style of music developed within the region and \\"Kuchean\\" music gained popularity as it spread along the trade lines of the Silk Road. Lively scenes of Kuchean music and dancing can be found in the Kizil Caves and are described in the writings of Xuanzang.\\"[T]he fair ladies and benefactresses of Kizil and Kumtura in their tight-waisted bodices and voluminous skirts recall--notwithstanding the Buddhic theme--that at all the halting places along the Silk Road, in all the rich caravan towns of the Tarim, Kucha was renowned as a city of pleasures, and that as far as China men talked of its musicians, its dancing girls, and its courtesans.\\" Kuchean music was very popular in Tang China, particularly the lute, which became known in Chinese as the pipa. For example, within the collection of the Guimet Museum, two Tang female musician figures represent the two prevailing traditions: one plays a Kuchean pipa and the other plays a Chinese jiegu (an Indian-style drum). The \\"music of Kucha\\" was transmitted from China to Japan, along with other early medieval music, during the same period, and is preserved there, somewhat transformed, as gagaku or Japanese court music. =Conquest by Tang= Following its conquest by the Tang dynasty in the 7th century, during Emperor Taizong's campaign against the Western Regions, the city of Kucha was regarded by Han Chinese as one of the Four Garrisons of Anxi: the \\"Pacified West\\", or even its capital. During periods of Tibetan domination it was usually at least semi-independent. It fell under Uyghur domination and became an important center of the later Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho after the Kyrgyz destruction of the Uyghur steppe empire in 840. The extensive ruins of the ancient capital and temple of Subashi (Chinese Qiuci), which was abandoned in the 13th century, lie north of modern Kucha. =Modern Kucha= Francis Younghusband, who passed through the oasis in 1887 on his journey from Beijing to India, described the district as \\"probably\\" having some 60,000 inhabitants. The modern Chinese town was about with a high wall, with no bastions or protection to the gateways, but a ditch about deep around it. It was filled with houses and \\"a few bad shops\\". The \\"Turk houses\\" ran right up to the edge of the ditch and there were remains of an old city to the south-east of the Chinese one, but most of the shops and houses were outside of it. About north of the Chinese city were barracks for 500 soldiers out of a garrison he estimated to total about 1,500 men, who were armed with old Enfield rifles \\"with the Tower mark.\\" Modern Kucha is part of Kuqa County, Xinjiang. It is divided into the new city, which includes the People's Square and transportation center, and the old city, where the Friday market and vestiges of the past city wall and cemetery are located. Along with agriculture, the city also manufactures cement, carpets and other household necessities in its local factories. Archaeological investigations There are several significant archaeological sites in the region which were investigated by the third (1905‚Äì1907, led by Albert Gr√ºnwedel) and fourth (1913‚Äì1914, led by Albert von Le Coq) German Turfan expeditions. Those in the immediate vicinity include the cave site of Achik-Ilek and Subashi. Kucha and Buddhism Bust of a bodhisattva from Kucha, 6th-7th century. Guimet Museum. It was an important Buddhist center from Antiquity until the late Middle Ages. Buddhism was introduced to Kucha before the end of the 1st century, however it was not until the 4th century that the kingdom became a major center of Buddhism, primarily the Sarvastivada, but eventually also Mahayana Buddhism during the Uighur period. In this respect it differed from Khotan, a Mahayana-dominated kingdom on the southern side of the desert. According to the Book of Jin, during the third century there were nearly one thousand Buddhist stupas and temples in Kucha. At this time, Kuchanese monks began to travel to China. The fourth century saw yet further growth for Buddhism within the kingdom. The palace was said to resemble a Buddhist monastery, displaying carved stone Buddhas, and monasteries around the city were numerous. Kucha is well known as the home of the great fifth-century translator monk KumƒÅrajƒ´va (344-413). =Monks= Po-Yen A monk from the royal family known as Po-Yen travelled to the Chinese capital, Luoyang, from 256-260. He translated six Buddhist texts into Chinese in 258 at China's famous White Horse Temple, including the Infinite Life Sutra, an important sutra in Pure Land Buddhism. Po-≈örƒ´mitra Po-≈örƒ´mitra was another Kuchean monk who traveled to China from 307-312 and translated three Buddhist texts. Po-Yen A second Kuchean Buddhist monk known as Po-Yen also went to Liangzhou (modern Wuwei, Gansu, China) and is said to have been well respected, although he is not known to have translated any texts. Tocharian languages Tocharian language. Kucha, 5th-8th century. Tokyo National Museum. The language of Kucha, as evidenced by surviving manuscripts and inscriptions, was Ku≈õi√±√±e (Kushine) also known as Tocharian B or West Tocharian, an Indo-European language. Later, under the Uighur domination, the Kingdom of Kucha gradually became Turkic speaking. Ku≈õi√±√±e was completely forgotten until the early 20th century, when inscriptions and documents in two related (but mutually unintelligible) languages were discovered at various sites in the Tarim Basin. Conversely, Tocharian A, or ƒÄr≈õi was native to the region of Turpan (known later as Turfan) and Agni (Qara≈°√§h√§r; Karashar), although the Ku≈õi√±√±e language also seems to have been spoken there. While they were written in a Central Asian Brahmi script used typically for Indo-Iranian languages, the Tocharian languages (as they became known by modern scholars) belonged to the centum group of Indo-European languages, which are otherwise native to southern and western Europe. The precise dating of known Tocharian texts is contested, but they were written around the 6th to 8th Centuries AD (although Tocharian speakers must have arrived in the region much earlier). Both languages became extinct before circa 1000 AD. Scholars are still trying to piece together a fuller picture of these languages, their origins, history and connections, etc. Neighbors The kingdom bordered Aksu and Kashgar to the west and Karasahr and Turpan to the east. Across the Taklamakan Desert to the south was Khotan. Kucha and the Kizil Caves The Kizil Caves lie about northwest of Kucha and were included within the rich fourth-century kingdom of Kucha. The caves claim origins from the royal family of ancient Kucha, specifically a local legend involving Princess Zaoerhan, the daughter of the King of Kucha. While out hunting, the princess met and fell in love with a local mason. When the mason approached the king to ask for permission to marry the princess, the king was appalled and vehemently against the union. He told the young man he would not grant permission unless the mason carved 1000 caves into the local hills. Determined, the mason went to the hills and began carving in order to prove himself to the king. After three years and carving 999 caves, he died from the exhaustion of the work. The distraught princess found his body, and grieved herself to death, and now, her tears are said to be current waterfalls that cascade down some of the cave's rock faces.  Coinage  A \\"Han Gui bilingual Wu Zhu coin\\" (Êº¢Èæú‰∫åÈ´î‰∫îÈäñÈå¢) produced by the Kingdom of Kucha with both a Chinese and what is presumed to be a Ku≈õi√±√±e inscription. From around the third or fourth century Kucha began the manufacture of Wu Zhu (‰∫îÈäñ) cash coins inspired by the diminutive and devalued Wu Zhu's of the post- Han dynasty era in Chinese history. It is very likely that the cash coins produced in Kucha predate the Kaiyuan Tongbao (ÈñãÂÖÉÈÄöÂØ≥) and that the native production of coins stopped sometime after the year 621 when the Wu Zhu cash coins were discontinued in China proper.The N√°prstek museum XINJIANG CAST CASH IN THE COLLECTION OF THE N√ÅPRSTEK MUSEUM, PRAGUE. by Ond≈ôej Klime≈° (ANNALS OF THE N√ÅPRSTEK MUSEUM 25 ‚Ä¢ PRAGUE 2004).

He also served several terms in the United States House of Representatives, from 1814 to 1817, and from 1819 to 1823. Cannon was a long-time foe of Andrew Jackson, and spent much of his political career opposing Jacksonite policies. Early life Born in Guilford County, North Carolina, Cannon was the son of Minos Cannon, who served as a soldier in the Continental Army. The family moved to the area that later became Williamson County, Tennessee, around 1790.Jonathan M. Atkins. \\"Newton Cannon\\", in Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture (online edition). Last accessed June 3, 2011.John Trotwood Moore and Austin Powers Foster (1923), Tennessee: the volunteer state, 1769-1923, The S. J. Clarke publishing company. Page 25. Cannon received a common school education and tried several occupations as a young man, working as a saddler, merchant and surveyor, and undertaking the study of law, before eventually becoming a planter in Williamson County.Portrait of Newton Cannon, Tennessee Portrait Project website, accessed May 27, 2011 Career Cannon entered political office in 1811, representing Williamson, Rutherford, Maury, Bedford, Lincoln, and Giles counties in the state senate in the 9th Tennessee General Assembly (1811‚Äì1812).Diane Black, Tennessee Senators, Territorial General Assembly 1794 to 106th General Assembly, 2009-10, Tennessee State Library and Archives. He served in the Creek War of 1813 as a colonel in the Tennessee Mounted Rifles. In 1813, he was a candidate for United States House of Representatives, losing the election to Felix Grundy. He won election to the seat as a Democratic- Republican the following year, however, in a special election held after Grundy resigned. Cannon was later reelected to a full term in the House, serving from September 16, 1814, to March 3, 1817. In 1819, he accepted an assignment from President James Monroe to negotiate a treaty with the Chickasaw. He was again elected to the U.S. House for the 16th Congress and won re-election to the 17th Congress, serving from March 4, 1819, to March 3, 1823. =Governorship= Cannon first sought the Tennessee governorship in 1827 in a field that initially included Sam Houston, former governor Willie Blount, Felix Grundy, and aging frontiersman John Rhea.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 59, 72-73, 81-84, 93-95. Cannon lost the election to Houston by a vote of 44,426 to 33,410. He subsequently returned to the General Assembly as a state senator, representing Rutherford and Williamson counties in the 18th General Assembly (1829‚Äì1830), and aligned himself with Andrew Erwin, John Williams and Davy Crockett, to oppose the policies of Jackson and his allies. He was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee Constitutional Convention of 1834, at which he served as chairman of the Committee of the Whole. Cannon again ran for governor in 1835, defeating incumbent William Carroll by a vote of 41,970 to 31,205. Carroll had been a popular governor, but he was seeking a fourth consecutive two-year term in spite of a provision of the state constitution that limited a governor to three terms.Jonathan M. Atkins. \\"William Carroll\\" in Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture (online edition). Last accessed June 3, 2011. Carroll maintained that the gubernatorial term limit in the state's original constitution no longer applied because it was replaced by a new constitution in 1834. Cannon, however, argued that the 1834 constitution was a revision rather than a replacement for the original constitution.Jonathan M. Atkins (1997), Parties, politics, and the sectional conflict in Tennessee, 1832-1861. University of Tennessee Press. Page 12. Cannon's view apparently prevailed with the voters. Cannon's election was also aided by division among Tennessee Democrat-Republicans over the U.S. Presidential candidacy of Tennessean Hugh Lawson White in opposition to the national party's choice of Martin Van Buren. Cannon was the first member of the Whig Party to be elected governor of Tennessee. He became the first governor to benefit from increased powers given to the office by the state constitution of 1834. As governor, in 1836 he convened the first special session of the legislature in state history. Cannon was re-elected to a second term as governor in 1837, defeating General Robert Armstrong.Stanley Folmsbee, Sectionalism and Internal Improvements in Tennessee, 1796‚Äì1845 (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1939), pp. 42-44, 121-125, 151-153. In his second term as governor, both houses of the General Assembly were controlled by Whigs, and the legislature approved proposals to create a new state bank and to expand state support for internal improvements such as roads, railroads, and canals. An advocate for public education, Cannon designated some revenues from the state bank to pay for schools. Cannon was publicly criticized for his implementation of the new laws, especially in East Tennessee, where voters grew impatient over his lack of support for the Hiwassee Railroad. In 1839, state Democrats, determined to defeat Cannon, convinced rising politician and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives James K. Polk to run against him. The two candidates toured the state together to give a series of public debates, the first of which took place at Murfreesboro on April 11, 1839. Cannon typically delivered slower, more methodical arguments, and was outshone in the debates by the quicker and wittier Polk. In the election, Polk narrowly defeated Cannon by a vote of 54,680 to 52,114. Cannon wanted to run against Polk in 1841, but Whig leaders instead nominated James C. Jones, thinking that Cannon would not be able to defeat Polk. Cannon died in Nashville at the age of sixty, just two years after his last candidacy for governor. He is interred in a cemetery on the grounds of his estate in Williamson County near Allisona. =Opposition to Andrew Jackson= Throughout his political career, Newton Cannon was known for his personal and political antagonism toward Andrew Jackson, whose policies he consistently opposed. Three different supposed interactions between the two men all have been suggested as explanations for the origin of Cannon's antipathy to Jackson.Mark Eaton Byrnes (2001), James K. Polk: a biographical companion, ABC-CLIO, , . Pages 29-30.Robert S. Brandt (1995), Touring the middle Tennessee backroads, John F. Blair, Publisher. , . Pages 181-182. The earliest of these interactions involved a horse track known as Clover Bottom that Jackson owned together with a pair of brothers, William and Patten Anderson.Tara Mitchell Mielnik. \\"Early Horse Racing Tracks\\", in Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture (online edition). Last accessed June 3, 2011. Cannon is purported to have lost substantial amounts of money and other possessions from gambling at Clover Bottom, and is said to have blamed Jackson and the Andersons for his losses, suspecting them of fixing races. The second encounter occurred in 1812 when Cannon served on a jury in a trial of Jonathan Magness who, with his two sons David and Perry Green, had been accused of murder in the death of Patten Anderson. After the jury returned a verdict of not guilty, Jackson is said to have shaken his fist at Cannon, saying \\"I'll mark you, young man.\\" Perhaps the most compelling explanation is Cannon's disapproval of Jackson's military leadership when he served as a detachment leader under Jackson's command during the Creek War. Cannon is said to have believed that Jackson had deliberately exposed Cannon and his men to unnecessary dangers. Family life and legacy Cannon was married twice. In 1813, he married Leah Pryor Perkins. She died in 1816. In 1818, he married Rachel Starnes Willborn.Elbert Watson (1964), Governor Newton Cannon Papers , Tennessee State Library and Archives, accessed May 30, 2011 He was the father of ten children.Governor's Information: Tennessee Governor Newton Cannon , National Governors Association website, 2004.

She was scrapped in 1973. History Dennis was named after Radioman Third Class Otis Lee Dennis. He was killed in action 1 February 1942 with Carleton Thayer Fogg (namesake of ) when their Douglas SBD Dauntless was lost during an attack launched by on Roi-Namur, Kwajalein. It was one of the first offensive operations following Pearl Harbor.After Action Report - Marshall Islands Raid - 1 February 1942. Dennis was launched on 4 December 1943 by Brown Shipbuilding, in Houston, Texas; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Dennis, mother of the late Radioman Third Class Dennis; and commissioned on 20 March 1944, with Lieutenant Commander Sigurd Hansen, USNR, in command. Dennis differed from most ships in her class in that she had a quadruple mount and a twin mount of Bofors guns instead of two twin mounts. This represented a 50% increase in medium anti-aircraft guns. =Pacific War= Dennis arrived at Pearl Harbor on 19 June 1944 to escort a convoy to Eniwetok and Kwajalein. She returned to Eniwetok on 29 July screening the light carrier . Joining the 5th Fleet, she escorted Carrier Division 22 to Manus for exercises, then sortied with Task Force 77 on 10 September to supply air support for the landings on Morotai Island from 15‚Äì27 September. From 12 October, Dennis screened the escort carriers supplying the air cover for the invasion of Leyte. On 25 October, she joined her carriers in making history as they fought a gallant action with the Japanese counter-attacking force in the Battle off Samar phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Dennis was positioned alone as the final destroyer escort between the screen of destroyers and destroyers escorts and the escort carriers being shielded. Dennis was credited with torpedoing and sinking a Japanese heavy cruiser in that action. Dennis rescued 434 survivors from the escort carrier , which had been sunk by a kamikaze. For this action, she shared in the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to TU 77.4.3, \\"Taffy 3\\". Arriving at Kossol Roads, Palaus on 28 October, she sailed three days later for the west coast, arriving at San Francisco, California on 26 November for an overhaul. Returning to the forward area Dennis departed Guam on 16 February 1945 for the invasion of Iwo Jima, patrolling off the island until 8 March, when she sailed to escort a convoy to Ulithi. On 21 March, she proceeded to join a carrier group launching air strikes in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa. She remained with the carriers as they gave close support to the invasion forces ashore. On 4 May, she rescued 88 of the crew of the escort carrier , a kamikaze victim. She served on radar picket duty at Ulithi from 9 May-3 June, then returned to Okinawa to join the Third Fleet for strikes against the Japanese mainland until 26 June. From 30 June 1945 until the end of the war, Dennis escorted convoys among Ulithi, Okinawa, the Philippines, and New Guinea. After the war, she escorted landing craft to Okinawa, then departed Leyte Gulf on 14 October for the west coast, arriving at San Diego, California on 6 November. She was placed out of commission in reserve there on 31 May 1946. Honors In addition to her Presidential Unit Citation, Dennis received four battle stars for World War II service.

It is the most rural of Hartford's five villages, situated on the White River and crossed by the Appalachian Trail. Almost half of the village was wiped out by a flood in 1927. Some areas have been developed for residential use, but significant forest, farming and open lands remain. West Hartford features a country store, a post office, a small library and a town park along the White River which is a popular fishing site. The village center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the West Hartford Village Historic District. Geography West Hartford is located in far northern Hartford, seven river miles up the White River from its mouth at the Connecticut River. Its center is at geographical coordinates 43¬∞ 42‚Ä≤ 44\\" North, 72¬∞ 25‚Ä≤ 7\\" West (43.71212, -72.418541). The White River runs through the Village, and along Clifford Park, a great place for fishing and canoeing. History The West Hartford village was settled in the late 18th century, primarily organized around mills and outlying agricultural areas. The oldest surviving house in the village was built in 1795 by Francis and Abigail (Hazen) Savage; she was the granddaughter of the area's first colonial landowner. A turnpike, now Vermont Route 14, was built along the river in 1800. The focal center of the village was established at Harper Savage Lane by construction of the first bridge to span the White River in the village in 1820, and then by the construction of a railroad station nearby. By 1830 the village had a church and post office, and the village continued to thrive during the 19th century, mainly due to its proximity to White River Junction, one of the most important railroad hubs in the region. Much of the village was destroyed by a major flood in 1867. This eliminated much of the local industry, but retail presence, driven by the presence of the railroad, continued. with In the spring of 1927 the Vermont rivers flooded, taking out several bridges, including the West Hartford bridge, then a covered bridge. Shortly after the flood the bridges were all replaced with \\"cookie cutter\\" bridges that were tall, green, steel truss bridges. In 2006 the West Hartford Bridge was replaced with a new single-span bridge, Veterans Bridge. The old bridge had a pool off the downstream side that local teens, children, and adults would jump off the bridge into the water. The new bridge is in a location where it is dangerous to jump because the deep pool is no longer accessible, though the teens, children, and adults still jump off the bridge. At the foot of the new bridge is a small area in remembrance of Hartford Veterans that have died in the wars. Clifford Park is a town maintained park that includes nature trails, a softball field, horseshoe pits, and a picnic area on the river. Every summer, it is turned into a major landing area for the hot air balloons that have taken off at the Quechee Balloon Festival, and every Halloween it is the Haunted Area for local youths sponsored by the Hartford Parks and Recreation Department. The park is named Clifford, after the former owner of the land that now holds the park, and the land that is the Westfield Drive community. On August 28, 2011 West Hartford was hit by Tropical Storm Irene. Several houses, the country store, the library, and the post office were affected. The post office was torn down, the store repaired, and the library has been rebuilt. The bridge and road also suffered damage from this event. The bridge was out of commission for several weeks forcing people to find alternative routes to get to work and into more populated areas. As for the road, Route 14, it was usable to a certain point. It was repaired slowly and in the village itself there were several large holes where the river gouged away the pavement, dirt, and gravel. The day after, August 29, people were out and about using their tractors and snowplows to clear Rt. 14 of mud and debris. While there were plenty of volunteers and they were very helpful and appreciated greatly, the people of West Hartford did not wait to be rescued; they rescued themselves. The little white church became a place for workers, local, out of town, and even out of state, to get something to eat and drink and a place to relax for a while. The church was also used as a place for donated items and food to be collected for victims of Irene. Clifford Park was a mess. It acquired at least a foot of mud and the playground, basketball half-court, tennis courts, and base ball field all had to be redone. Now the slide, swings, and tire swing are all back in place. There are picnic tables underneath a roof, benches stand here and there around the perimeter of the field, and the gravel parking lot is now outlined by a wooden fence. It's cleaned up and repaired now, but you can still see the evidence of that day. Houses still bear the mark of Irene and that of people trying to fix the problems. You can still see where the river eroded the edges of the road and banks, underneath the patches that were put there. Schools West Hartford elementary students attend Ottoquechee School in Quechee, VT (K-5) and then attend middle and high school at Hartford Memorial Middle School (6-8) and Hartford High School (9-12). Families looking for their children to be in private school usually turn to the Upper Valley Waldorf School in Quechee (K-8), or Mid Vermont Christian School in Quechee (K-6) and the Middle School (7-8) and High School (9-12).

It is the holding company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), an American provider of financial analysis software and services. Moody's was founded by John Moody in 1909 to produce manuals of statistics related to stocks and bonds and bond ratings. Moody's was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 1962. In 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun off Moody's Corporation as a separate company that was listed on the NYSE under MCO. In 2007, Moody's Corporation was split into two operating divisions, Moody's Investors Service, the rating agency, and Moody's Analytics, with all of its other products.Moody‚Äôs Corporation Announces New Business Unit Structure August 7, 2007 History of Moody's Moody's Corporation traces its history back to two publishing companies established by John Moody, the inventor of modern bond credit ratings. It was first published in 1900 by John Moody, nine years before he founded Moody's Corporation. Initially called Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, it was later superseded by Moody's Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities, then by Moody's Analyses of Investments. In 1900, Moody published his first market assessment, called Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, and established John Moody & Company. The publication provided detailed statistics relating to stocks and bonds of financial institutions, government agencies, manufacturing, mining, utilities, and food companies. It experienced early success, selling out its first print run in its first two months. By 1903, Moody's Manual was a nationally recognized publication. The 1907 financial crisis fueled several changes in the markets, including the creation of the Federal Reserve System. Meanwhile, Moody was forced to sell his business, due to a shortage of capital. Moody returned in 1909 with a new publication focused solely on railroad bonds, Analysis of Railroad Investments, and a new company, Moody's Analyses Publishing Company. In 1962, Moody's Investors Service was bought by Dun & Bradstreet, a firm engaged in the related field of credit reporting, although they continued to operate largely as independent companies. By the late 1990s, Moody's superior performance compared to its parent company brought investor pressure to separate the businesses. In December 1999, Dun & Bradstreet announced it would spin off Moody's Investors Service into a separate publicly traded company. The spin-off was completed on September 30, 2000. Moody's Investors Service Moody's Investors Service is the bond credit rating business of Moody's Corporation, representing the company's traditional line of business and its historical name. Moody's Investors Service rates debt securities in several market segments related to public and commercial securities in the bond market. These include government, municipal and corporate bonds; managed investments such as money market funds, fixed-income funds and hedge funds; financial institutions including banks and non-bank finance companies; and asset classes in structured finance. Moody's Investors Service's closest competitors are Standard & Poor's (S&P;) and Fitch Group. Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Big Three credit rating agencies. Moody's Investors Service and its close competitors play a key role in global capital markets as a supplementary credit analysis provider for banks and other financial institutions in assessing the credit risk of particular securities. According to Moody's, the purpose of its ratings is to \\"provide investors with a simple system of gradation by which future relative creditworthiness of securities may be gauged\\". To each of its ratings from Aa through Caa, Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3; the lower the number, the higher-end the rating. Aaa, Ca and C are not modified this way. Moody's Analytics Moody's Analytics is a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation established in 2007 to focus on non-rating activities. It performs economic research related to credit analysis, performance management, financial modeling, structured analysis and financial risk management. Moody's Analytics also offers software and consulting services, including proprietary economic models and software tools, as well as professional training for the financial services sector, particularly risk management accreditation. Moody's Analytics started in 1995 as a business unit providing quantitative analysis services, including credit risk assessment software and services, called Moody's Risk Management Service (MRMS), and grew through partnerships and acquisitions in the late 1990s and 2000s, expanding its client base and capabilities. Acquisitions included KMV, Economy.com, Wall Street Analytics, Fermat International, Enb Consulting Ltd., The Institute of Risk Standards and Qualifications (iRSQ), CSI Global Education Inc., and Bureau van DijkBureau van Dijk. The Moody's Foundation In 2002, Moody's Corporation created a corporate philanthropy program, The Moody's Foundation, focused on educational initiatives in mathematics, economics and finance. The organization offers grants to 501(c)(3) non-profits and equivalent international organizations, accredited schools and some governmental organizations. Since 2006, its main program is the annual Moody's Mega Math Challenge (M3 Challenge), a student academic challenge co-sponsored with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), in which several hundred teams of high school students use quantitative analysis and modeling to solve problems related to real-life financial topics such as Social Security and the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. Since 2010. Moody's Research Labs Moody's Research Labs, Inc. was a business incubator focused on research and development specializing in financial risk modeling and analysis, focused on developing such products for use by other divisions of Moody's Corporation. Its president was Roger Stein. In March 2011 Moody's Analytics announced the release of a software program developed by Moody's Research Labs, the Mortgage Portfolio Analyzer, to assist portfolio managers in managing credit risk. Moody's Research Labs was dissolved in February 2012. Lawsuit Settlements October 2011 - Moody‚Äôs reached a settlement resolving claims by the state of Connecticut that the credit rating company unfairly gave lower ratings to public bonds. July 2012 - Moody‚Äôs said it reached a settlement with stockholders in lawsuits filed over structured finance ratings. April 2013 - Moody's reached a settlement avoiding what would have been their first jury trial over crisis-era ratings. The fourteen plaintiffs, were led by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and King County, Washington. They claimed lawsuits filed in 2008 and 2009 that Moody's misled them by allegedly inflating ratings on two so-called structured investment vehicles they purchased. Acquisitions In 2019, Moody's Corporation purchased the majority share in the California-based climate risk data firm, Four Twenty Seven (427), that \\"measures the physical risks\\" of \\"climate change\\". This acquisition is the \\"latest indication that global warming can threaten the creditworthiness of governments and companies\\" globally, according to a July 25, 2019 article in The New York Times.

PSAC members work in every province and territory, and also work abroad in embassies and consulates. Many of PSAC's some 200,000 members work for the federal public service, crown corporations or agencies as immigration officers, fisheries officers, food inspectors, customs officers, national defence civilian employees, and the like. However, an increasing number of PSAC members work in non-federal sectors: in women's shelters, universities, security agencies and casinos. In Northern Canada, PSAC represents most unionized workers employed in the Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. PSAC's National President is Chris Aylward. PSAC is headquartered in Ottawa with 23 regional offices across Canada. PSAC's Ottawa headquarters building, designed in 1968 by Paul Schoeler, is a notable example of modernist architecture in Ottawa. History PSAC was formed when the Civil Service Association of Canada, led by Calbert Best, and Civil Service Federation of Canada, led by Claude Edwards, agreed to merge. Claude Edwards was elected as the first PSAC president. PSAC's founding convention took place at Ottawa's Chateau Laurier in 1966. = Bargaining = PSAC signed its first collective agreements with Treasury Board in 1968. By 2015, the union was negotiating 316 separate collective agreements under federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions. = Strikes = PSAC's first strike came in November 1971 against Defence Construction Ltd. In 1980, the PSAC's large CR bargaining unit, made up largely of women clerical workers, went out on in Canada's biggest single bargaining unit work stoppage. PSAC's 1991 general strike, the largest single union strike in Canadian history, brought job security improvements. = Women in the union = Most founding convention delegates were men. In 1967, PSAC began organizing secretaries, stenographers and typists. By 1976, PSAC had abolished the practice of tying a secretary‚Äôs salary to the rank of her boss (a practice known as \\"rug-ranking\\"), created an Equal Opportunities Committee to address women's issues and elected Aileen Manion, PSAC's first female national officer. = Equality rights = From 1981 onward, PSAC's Equal Opportunities Committee included all equity-seeking groups. In 1988, PSAC adopted a comprehensive human rights policy. Action committees for members with disabilities and racially visible members started in 1990. By 1999, the union started holding conferences for racially visible members, Aboriginal Peoples and workers with disabilities. In 2004, the first network of Aboriginal, Inuit and Metis members was formed to advance their rights within and beyond the union. A line through time: PSAC‚Äôs 50 years of solidarity  Executive  The National President, the National Executive Vice-President and the seven Regional Executive Vice-Presidents form the Alliance Executive Committee (AEC). The AEC is responsible for the day-to-day decisions of the union with respect to finances, overseeing campaigns, mobilizing the membership, advocating on behalf of the membership and advancing the union and its members' rights in the workplace.

It is usually a diffuse reflection due to scattering, as opposed to specular reflection as from a mirror, although specular backscattering can occur at normal incidence with a surface. Backscattering has important applications in astronomy, photography, and medical ultrasonography. The opposite effect is forward scatter, e.g. when a translucent material like a cloud diffuses sunlight, giving soft light.  Backscatter of waves in physical space  Backscattering can occur in quite different physical situations, where the incoming waves or particles are deflected from their original direction by different mechanisms: *Diffuse reflection from large particles and Mie scattering, causing alpenglow and gegenschein, and showing up in weather radar; *Inelastic collisions between electromagnetic waves and the transmitting medium (Brillouin scattering and Raman scattering), important in fiber optics, see below; *Elastic collisions between accelerated ions and a sample (Rutherford backscattering) *Bragg diffraction from crystals, used in inelastic scattering experiments (neutron backscattering, X-ray backscattering spectroscopy); *Compton scattering, used in Backscatter X-ray imaging. * Stimulated backscatter, observed in non-linear optics, and described by a class of solutions to the three-wave equation. Sometimes, the scattering is more or less isotropic, i. e. the incoming particles are scattered randomly in various directions, with no particular preference for backward scattering. In these cases, the term \\"backscattering\\" just designates the detector location chosen for some practical reasons: *in X-ray imaging, backscattering means just the opposite of transmission imaging; *in inelastic neutron or X-ray spectroscopy, backscattering geometry is chosen because it optimizes the energy resolution; *in astronomy, backscattered light is that which is reflected with a phase angle of less than 90¬∞. In other cases, the scattering intensity is enhanced in backward direction. This can have different reasons: *In alpenglow, red light prevails because the blue part of the spectrum is depleted by Rayleigh scattering. *In gegenschein, constructive interference might play a role (this needs verification). *Coherent backscattering is observed in random media; for visible light most typically in suspensions like milk. Due to weak localization, enhanced multiple scattering is observed in back direction. ** The Back Scattering Alignment (BSA) coordinate system is often used in radar applications ** The Forward Scattering Alignment (FSA) coordinate system is primarily used in optical applications Backscattering properties of a target are wavelength dependent and can also be polarization dependent. Sensor systems using multiple wavelengths or polarizations can thus be used to infer additional information about target properties. = Radar, especially weather radar = Backscattering is the principle behind radar systems. In weather radar, backscattering is proportional to the 6th power of the diameter of the target multiplied by its inherent reflective properties, provided the wavelength is larger than the particle diameter (Rayleigh scattering). Water is almost 4 times more reflective than ice but droplets are much smaller than snow flakes or hail stones. So the backscattering is dependent on a mix of these two factors. The strongest backscatter comes from hail and large graupel (solid ice) due to their sizes, but non-Rayleigh (Mie scattering) effects can confuse interpretation. Another strong return is from melting snow or wet sleet, as they combine size and water reflectivity. They often show up as much higher rates of precipitation than actually occurring in what is called a brightband. Rain is a moderate backscatter, being stronger with large drops (such as from a thunderstorm) and much weaker with small droplets (such as mist or drizzle). Snow has rather weak backscatter. Dual polarization weather radars measure backscatter at horizontal and vertical polarizations to infer shape information from the ratio of the vertical and horizontal signals.  In waveguides  The backscattering method is also employed in fiber optics applications to detect optical faults. Light propagating through a fiber optic cable gradually attenuates due to Rayleigh scattering. Faults are thus detected by monitoring the variation of part of the Rayleigh backscattered light. Since the backscattered light attenuates exponentially as it travels along the optical fiber cable, the attenuation characteristic is represented in a logarithmic scale graph. If the slope of the graph is steep, then power loss is high. If the slope is gentle, then optical fiber has a satisfactory loss characteristic. The loss measurement by the backscattering method allows measurement of a fiber optic cable at one end without cutting the optical fiber hence it can be conveniently used for the construction and maintenance of optical fibers.  In photography  The term backscatter in photography refers to light from a flash or strobe reflecting back from particles in the lens's field of view causing specks of light to appear in the photo. This gives rise to what are sometimes referred to as orb artifacts. Photographic backscatter can result from snowflakes, rain or mist, or airborne dust. Due to the size limitations of the modern compact and ultra- compact cameras, especially digital cameras, the distance between the lens and the built-in flash has decreased, thereby decreasing the angle of light reflection to the lens and increasing the likelihood of light reflection off normally sub-visible particles. Hence, the orb artifact is commonplace with small digital or film camera photographs.Cynthia Baron. Adobe Photoshop Forensics: Sleuths, Truths, and Fauxtography. Cengage Learning; 2008. . p. 310‚Äì.

There were two more labels cast at the top of the barrel, to the right is \\"The decree of the faithful and Christ-king and the Grand Duke Fyodor Ivanovich, Sovereign Autocrat of all Great Russia with his pious and god-blessed queen, Grand Princess Irina\\"; While to the one to the left is \\"Cast in the city of Moscow in the summer of year 7904(c. 1585 in Gregorian calendar), in his third summer state, by Andrey Chokov.\\" The cannon-style gun carriage, added in 1835, is purely decorative. This weapon was never intended to be transported on or fired from this gun carriage. According to one version, the name of this cannon, \\"Tsar\\", is associated with the image of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich. However, it is more likely that this name owes to the massive size of this cannon. In old times the cannon is also sometimes called the \\"Russian Shotgun\\"(–î—Ä–æ–±–æ–≤–∏–∫ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π, Drobovik Rossiyskiy, lit. Shotgun Russian), because the gun was meant to shoot 800 kg stone grapeshot rather than true, solid cannonballs. The cannon ought to be classified as only a mortar by its barrel length in modern classification, with the barrel length at only 6 calibers. However, in the 17th to the 18th century, it was rather called a \\"Bombard cannon\\", since mortars at that time had barrel lengths of no more than 2.5 calibers, or 3.5 calibers at maximum for long-range mortars. The spherical cast-iron projectiles located in front of the Tsar Cannon‚Äîeach of which weighs approximately one ton‚Äîwere produced in 1834 as a decoration, and are too large to have been used in the cannon. According to legend, the cannonballs were manufactured in St. Petersburg, and were intended to be a humorous addition and a symbol of the friendly rivalry between Moscow and St. Petersburg.

History Tsar Cannon on a 1978 USSR postage stamp. The cannon was cast in bronze in 1586, during the reign of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich, in the Cannon yard, by Russian master Andrey Chokhov. The carriages and the cannon itself was richly decorated in 1835 at the St. Petersburg plant of Berd, with designs by architect A. P. Bryullov and drawings engineer P. Ya. de Witte. The Tsar Cannon was placed at several points around Moscow in its history. It is known to have been mounted on a special frame with a fixed inclination angle in the Red Square near the Place of Skulls in order to protect the eastern approaches to the Kremlin, indicating that it originally did have a practical application. However, by 1706, it was moved to the Kremlin Arsenal and mounted on a wooden gun carriage. It was not used during the French invasion of Russia, although Napoleon Bonaparte considered removing it to France as a war trophy. The wooden gun carriage burnt in the fire that consumed Moscow in 1812, and was replaced in 1835 by the present metal carriage, which disabled the firing function of the cannon. In 1860, the Tsar Cannon was moved to its current location on Ivanovskaya Square near the Tsar Bell, which is similarly massive and is the largest bell in the world (but which has never been rung). Voltaire joked that the Kremlin's two greatest items were a bell which was never rung and a cannon that was never fired. For a long time, there was a common theory that the Tsar Cannon was created only to impress foreigners of Russia's military powers. Thus, according to writer Albert Valentinov: > \\"...Andrey Chokov knew from the very first moment that this would not be a > whopper cannon at all. Even if we assume that the barrel would fire > grapeshot, a massive amount of propellant would be needed to push the two- > ton shot, making it impossible for the cannon to be transported from one > position to another. Therefore Chokhov did not mean to cast it as a > functional cannon at all. His cannon is always only a symbol of Russian > power and of the capabilities of the Russian industry. If we render a > Russian master able to create such a whopper cannon, the smaller ones would > have much less use. Therefore, the Tsar Cannon was put on display in the > Kremlin for foreign diplomats.\\" However, subsequent studies showed that this version, which emphasized that the creation of the cannon was purely propagandistic, was only fiction. The cannon was last restored in 1980 in the town of Serpukhov. It was thoroughly studied by specialists in the Artillery Academy at that time and gunpowder residue was found, indicating that the cannon had been fired at least once, hinged and dug into the ground. –¶–∞—Ä—å-–ø—É—à–∫–∞ ‚Äì –≤–æ–≤—Å–µ –Ω–µ –ø—É—à–∫–∞: –ß—Ç–æ –∂–µ —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç –≤ –ö—Ä–µ–º–ª–µ Another theory by other researchers is that Tsar cannon never fired because of the bronze parts that would fade away after the shot, also due to the absence of a pilot hole that makes firing completely impossible.  Replicas  = The Donetsk copy = In the spring of 2001, as commissioned by the management of the Moscow Udmort enterprise \\"OAO Izhstal\\", a replica of the cannon was cast in iron. The replica weighed 42 tons, with a single wheel at 1.5 tons, the kernel at 1.2 meters and a caliber of exactly 89 cm. This copy was given as a present from Moscow to Donetsk, which was installed in front of the Donetsk City Hall in May 2001. There were two copies, with the other one produced in Izhevsk set in the premises of OAO Izhstal. = The Yoshkar-Ola copy = In 2007, another replica was installed in front of the National Art Gallery in Yoshkar-Ola. This replica was made in a scale of 1:2. This replica is incomplete, with ornaments changed or absent, and other details missing. The kernel of the cannon weighs about 12 tons, with the barrel and the carriage cast in steel, and the wheels being solid. Three staples were installed on the cannon for fastening cables when moving it. It was cast on Zvenigovsky Shipyard named after N. S. Butyakov. Initially, the ornaments were cut from wood, and then cast from metal. The copy was suitable for shooting, as the barrel and the core were welded together. Four ornamental cannonballs are located next to the cannon.  Perm Tsar Cannon  There was the world's largest 20-inch cast iron cannon in Perm. Unlike other \\"Tsar cannon\\"s, the one in Perm was a military weapon. The cannon, nicknamed the \\"Perm Giant\\", was made in 1868, by the order of the Ministry of Marine to the Motovilikha manufacturing plant (which is PAO \\"Motovilikha Plants\\" today, manufacturing weapon systems such as cannons, mortars, howitzers, self-propelled artillery, \\"Grad\\", \\"Uragan\\" and \\"Smerch\\" rocket systems). Tests were carried out with the gun on 16 August 1869, starting from firing from the shore of the Kama River (which is around 0.8‚Äì1 km wide). Later tests were carried out on this place until the end of Perestroika, with a lot happening in Soviet times. A certain F. V. Pestich, chief of the artillery of Kronstadt port attending most of the tests. The Perm cannon made a total of 314 shots, including grapeshot and bombs of different systems. As a result, the strength of the cannon was tested, and the weight of the powder charge was optimized. During the test, the charge weight was gradually increased to 120 kg. The set amount of propellant charge was 53 kg of black gunpowder in battle, putting the firing range to at most 1.2 km. As quoted by writer Mikhail Osorgin, who witnessed the events: > \\"...In fact, 4 miles from the city, on the banks of the river, there was a > cannon factory. Trying new guns, not testing shot projectiles (but shells > seems more while there was none), but cannonballs.

The Perm cannon was to take its place in Kronstadt at Fort Constantine, where a special carriage was already installed to ensure all-around coverage, and to protect St. Petersburg from the sea. Two such cannons were also intended to equip the armored frigate \\"Minin\\", which was built in St. Petersburg from 1866 to 1878. However, the cannon never reached Kronstadt. The Giant has been returned to the road in Perm. This is due to the fact that the engineer-inventor Pavel Matveyevich Obukhov of Zlatoust has developed the technology to produce high-strength steel cannons. Having established a factory in St. Petersburg, he began producing lighter cannons, which were installed with breech (the Krupp system), technically outdating the Perm cannon. Emperor Alexander II's decision saved it from destruction, instead preserving it as a historical relic. Today, the Perm Tsar Cannon is held on exhibition in the open museum of military equipment belonging to PAO \\"Motovilikha Plants\\".

It has been ordered by Kuwait and Qatar, with orders for all eight customers still pending as of September 2017. The aircraft has, as of 2016, been provided in a basic air-defense form and has been upgraded to newer production standards which include internal IRST, air-to-ground precision strike capability (with Royal Air Force Typhoons participating in air strikes destroying tanks in Libya in 2011 as their combat debut), and HMSS (helmet-mounted symbology system) helmets. Most of the major systems including the CAPTOR radar and the Defence Aids Sub-System (DASS) are expected to be improved and updated over time, with the radar being updated to an AESA, being the CAPTOR-E/CAESAR, of which the Kuwait Air Force will be the inaugural operator, with first deliveries of their 28 new-built aircraft to commence in 2019. Development aircraft Seven development aircraft (DA) were built with varying equipment fits and flight test roles. ;DA1 DA1 in 2013 :DA1's main role was handling characteristics and engine performance. :DA1 was assembled in 1992 and first flew on 27 March 1994 with Luftwaffe serial 98+29. The military evaluation phase commenced in 1996. In 1997 after 123 flights, DA1's RB199 engines were replaced by EJ200s, it also was refitted with the Martin-Baker Mk.16A ejector seat and a full avionics fit. Following these modifications it rejoined the flight test programme in 1999. Following the loss of DA6, DA1 was transferred to Spain to undertake the remaining development work including IRIS-T trials. :The aircraft was retired on 21 December 2005, eleven years, eight months, and 24 days after its first flight. :It is on display at the Flugwerft Schlei√üheim (external site of the Deutsches Museum) near Munich, Germany. ;DA2 :DA2 undertook envelope expansion, flight control assessment and load trials. The aircraft first flew on 6April 1994 as ZH588. The flight control assessment included development of the Eurofighter's \\"carefree handling\\". On 23 December 1997 DA2 became the first Eurofighter to achieve Mach2 and in January 1998 undertook refuelling trials with a RAF VC10. Like DA1, DA2 was upgraded in 1998 with new engines, ejector seat and avionics and rejoined the test programme in August. In 2000 the aircraft was covered with 490 pressure transducers; due to the fact that they were covered by black pads and had associated wiring the aircraft was painted in a gloss black scheme. The pressure transducers measured the effects of various weapons loads and external fuel tanks. In 2002 the aircraft undertook ASRAAM trials, completed carefree handling trials and commenced DASS decoy trials. :Now retired and on display in the Milestones of Flight Gallery at the RAF Museum at Hendon. ;DA3 :Weapons systems development. ;DA4 DA4 in 2011 :Radar and avionics development, now on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford. In the process of being moved to Newark Air Museum, Nottinghamshire. ;DA5 :Radar and avionics development, being upgraded to Tranche 2 standard. ;DA6 :Airframe development and handling. DA6 was lost in a crash in Spain in November 2002 after both engines failed. EADS Germany's DA1 was transferred to EADS-CASA. ;DA7 :Navigation, avionics and missile carriage.

The 36¬∫ Stormo received its first Typhoon on 1October 2007. By 2018 the Italian Air Force had three Eurofighter wings. =Spanish Air Force aircraft= As of December 2006 the Spanish Air Force (Ej√©rcito del Aire) has one squadron of aircraft. The first aircraft was delivered to Wing 11 in October 2003 at Moron airbase, Spain. In Spanish service, the aircraft is designated the C.16 Typhoon.. =Luftwaffe aircraft= As of October 2006 Germany had two active EF-2000 fighter wings, Jagdgeschwader 73 and Jagdgeschwader 74.

They will equip five front-line squadrons, one front-line flight and one reserve squadrons, the Operational Conversion Unit (OCU). ;Typhoon T1 :The Typhoon T1 is a Tranche 1, batch 1 two-seat trainer. :The first Typhoon T1 is one of the Instrumented Production Aircraft (IPA1) and remains part of the BAE fleet. The aircraft's maiden flight was on April 15, 2002. The official in service date for the first RAF Typhoon T1, serial ZJ803, was June 30, 2003.https://www.jetphotos.com/registration/ZJ803 Formal delivery occurred on December 18 at which point 17 Sqn began a full flying programme. :The first squadrons, No. 17 OEU and No. 29 OCU Sqns, moved to RAF Coningsby in 2005 to begin establishing an initial operational capability (IOC). :In 2001, it was announced that the Royal Air Force (RAF) would not use the aircraft's internal 27 mm Mauser cannon. This was due to a desire to save money by removing gun support costs, ammunition stocks, training costs, etc. The gun was also deemed unnecessary since the missile armament was believed to be adequate in the Typhoon's fighter role. However, because removal of the cannon would affect the aircraft's flight characteristics, requiring modification of the aircraft's flight software the RAF decided all its Typhoons would be fitted with the cannon but that it would not be used or supported. The service argued that this would save money by reducing the requirement for ground equipment, removing training costs and avoiding the fatigue effects of firing the cannon. The RAF maintained the option to activate the cannons at very short notice were operational requirements to change.. However, in a third change of policy, the Daily Telegraph reported on 3October 2006 that the RAF will fully utilise the cannon. ;Typhoon T1A :Typhoon T1As are Tranche 1, batch 2 two-seat trainers. There would not normally be a different designation for a different aircraft batch; however, the Batch2 aircraft has a fuel system modification to fix a fuel gauge problem identified in the development aircraft fleet. ;Typhoon F2 :The F2 is the single-seat fighter variant. The first F2 is IPA5 and also remains with BAE, its first flight was June 6, 2002. :The first operational squadron, No. 3, formed at RAF Cottesmore on March 31, 2006 and moved to its new base RAF Coningsby the following day. No. 11 squadron, the second operational squadron received its first aircraft (ZJ931) on October 9, 2006. As of June 2018, the RAF had bought 53 Tranche 1 Typhoons. The UK agreed to approve production of \\"Tranche 2\\" in December 2004, this tranche will see the RAF receive a further 89 aircraft, bringing its Typhoon inventory to 144. This followed protracted negotiations regarding the early introduction of ground attack capabilities of the aircraft and hence its swing-role capability. While this was always planned it was intended to come at a much later date. ;Typhoon FGR4 :Single-seat Block 5 or later aircraft (built or upgraded from F2) are known as Typhoon FGR4s. The new mark number represents the increased capabilities of the Block 5 aircraft (fighter/ground attack/reconnaissance). The FGR4 has from June 2008 achieved the required standard for multi-role operations.. ;Typhoon T3 :Two-seat Block 5 or later aircraft (built or upgraded from T1) are known as Typhoon T3s.. As of June 2018, the RAF has 67 Tranche 2 Typhoons and has contracted to purchase 40 Tranche3 Typhoons. 107 Tranche2 and3 Typhoons will be modified via \\"Project Centurion\\", allowing them to utilise Meteor missiles, Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles. 24 Tranche1 Typhoons will be retained for UK Quick Reaction Alert purposes, and will not be modified under Centurion. No. IX Squadron, based at RAF Lossiemouth, retains the Tranche1 Typhoon for QRA purposes but also serves the purpose of acting as an aggressor aircraft, similar to that of the USAF Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon. These aircraft work in conjunction with the 100 Squadron BAe Hawk T.1 aircraft based at RAF Leeming, providing air combat training and dogfight training to RAF and Royal Navy pilots. Proposed versions =Navalised Typhoon= Owing to the withdrawal of France from the Eurofighter 2000 project, in part due to France's desire to have a greater role in the development and marketing of the aircraft, the pursuit of a naval Typhoon has never seriously been considered. However, a navalised variant of the aircraft was first proposed in the late 1990s as a potential solution to the UK Royal Navy's need for a Future Carrier-Borne Aircraft (FCBA) for its new (Queen Elizabeth-class) aircraft carriers,... In January 2001, the UK Ministry of Defence formally discounted the option of a navalised Eurofighter for its new aircraft carriers, in favour of the STOVL ('B') variant of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which (at that time) promised to be a capable, low-cost and more stealthy aircraft that would enter into service circa 2012‚Äîa date that tied in well with the in-service date for the new UK aircraft carriers as it stood at that time. It was rejected by the United Kingdom on \\"cost effectiveness grounds\\".. , the navalised Typhoon remained only a proposal.. but there has been some interest expressed by other nations, such as India, in adapting the Typhoon for aircraft carrier operations.. The proposed variant design would enable the Typhoon to operate from carriers on a Short Take-Off but Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) basis, using a 'ski jump' ramp for aircraft launch and arresting gear for conventional landing. In February 2011, BAE debuted a navalised Typhoon in response to the Indian tender. The model offered is STOBAR capable, corresponding to the Indian Navy's future aircraft carrier, . The changes needed to enable the Typhoon to launch by ski-jump and recover by arrestor hook added about 500 kg to the airframe, however this is now thought to be substantially more given the Typhoons's \\"unfriendly\\" design in terms of adapting the airframe to suit sustained naval operations. If the Indian Navy pursues a catapult launch carrier, the Typhoon is completely uncompetitive against tender rivals (e.g. Rafale and Super Hornet) since meeting \\"...catapult requirements would add too much weight to the aircraft, blunt performance and add substantially to modification costs\\".\\"BAE Displays Model of Navalized Typhoon for India\\" Defense News, 9February 2011. Retrieved: 20 February 2011. =Typhoon ECR= On 5 November 2019, Kurt Rossner, Head of Combat Aircraft Systems at Airbus proposed an Electronic Combat Role (ECR)-SEAD capability for the aircraft. The Typhoon ECR would be configured with two Escort Jammer pods under the wings and two Emitter Location Systems at the wingtips. Armament configuration would include four MBDA Meteor, two IRIS-T and six SPEAR-EW in addition to three drop tanks. The plane would be a two seat variant carrying a mission specialist with access to dedicated electronic warfare and mission control screens.https://www.airbus.com/content/dam/events/conference/tmb2019/TMB- Combat.pdf See also References External links * *RAF Eurofighter page Category:1994 establishments in Europe Variants Typhoon F2 ","title":"Eurofighter Typhoon variants"},{"id":"863678","text":"Dewitt Clinton Senter (March 26, 1830June 14, 1898) was an American politician who served as Governor of Tennessee from 1869 to 1871. He had previously served in the Tennessee House of Representatives (1855-1861), where he opposed secession on the eve of the Civil War. He was elected to the Tennessee Senate following the war, and was chosen as Speaker of the Senate in 1867. As speaker, he became governor upon the resignation of William G. Brownlow in 1869.John Thweatt, Dewitt Clinton Senter, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 30 October 2012. Senter is perhaps best remembered for undoing many of Brownlow's radical initiatives, most notably the restoring of the right to vote to former Confederates. The current Tennessee State Constitution was written and enacted during Senter's tenure. Early life and career Senter was born in McMinn County, Tennessee, the son of William Tandy Senter and Nancy White. His father was a popular Methodist minister and renowned orator who served in the United States House of Representatives in the mid-1840s, and was a delegate to Tennessee's 1834 constitutional convention.Oliver Perry Temple, Notable Men of Tennessee, From 1833 to 1875, Their Times and Their Contemporaries (New York: Cosmopolitan Press, 1912), pp. 182-185.

Turley.Finding Aid for Governor Dewitt Clinton Senter Papers, 1869-1871 , Tennessee State Library and Archives website, June 2004. Retrieved: 30 October 2012. Senter represented Grainger County in the state House of Representatives from 1855 to 1861. A Whig, he remained staunchly opposed to secession on the eve of the Civil War. In May 1861, he voted against the state's Ordinance of Secession, and canvassed in East Tennessee in an attempt to rally the region's Unionists. He was a member of the Grainger County delegation at the East Tennessee Convention, which sought to form a separate, Union-aligned state in East Tennessee.Oliver Perry Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1995), p. 361. In 1862, Senter was arrested and jailed for several months by Confederate authorities. After his release, he fled to Louisville, Kentucky.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 190-193. He was an elector for the Republican Party ticket in the 1864 presidential election. In January 1865, Senter was elected to the Tennessee Senate, representing Grainger, Claiborne, Anderson, and Campbell counties, and served as the Senate's Chairman of the Committee on Incorporations. That same year, he became president of the Cincinnati, Cumberland Gap and Charleston Railroad, a position in which he served until 1866. In 1867, the state senate elected him Speaker of the Senate. Governor Senter initially supported the Radical Republican initiatives of Governor William G. Brownlow, which included the disfranchisement of ex-Confederates. In October 1867, he helped elect Brownlow to the United States Senate seat held by David T. Patterson, whose term was set to expire in March 1869.E. Merton Coulter, William G. Brownlow: Fighting Parson of the Southern Highlands (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999), pp. 347. Brownlow resigned as governor on February 25, 1869, and departed for Washington, D.C., to take his seat in the Senate. Under the Tennessee Constitution, the Speaker of the Senate is the first in the gubernatorial line of succession, and thus Senter became governor following Brownlow's resignation.William E. Hardy, \\"The Margins of William Brownlow's Words: New Perspectives on the End of Radical Reconstruction in Tennessee,\\" Journal of East Tennessee History, Vol. 84 (2012), pp. 78-86. Brownlow's radical policies of disfranchisement had left the state divided and had led to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. In his inaugural address, Senter vowed to aggressively pursue the Klan and quell Klan violence. In May 1869, however, he disbanded the state guard, which had been fighting the Klan, but had become unpopular. He also announced he supported restoring the voting rights of former Confederates. Since Brownlow was near the end of his term as governor when he resigned, Senter was thrust into a reelection campaign within a few weeks of taking office. His relatively lenient policies toward former Confederates led to a rift in the state's Radical Republican ranks, as many Radicals wanted to continue Brownlow's policies and feared retribution if ex- Confederates and Democrats should once again control the state. At the Radicals' tumultuous convention on May 20, 1869, they were unable to agree on a candidate for governor. In subsequent separate conventions, the Radicals who favored continuing Brownlow's policies nominated William B. Stokes, and those who favored more lenient policies nominated Senter. Under Brownlow, the legislature had given the governor the power to appoint county election commissioners, who were charged with ensuring former Confederates did not vote. Using this power, Senter replaced nearly three-fourths of Brownlow's commissioners. While the law still technically forbade ex-Confederates from voting, Senter's new commissioners did not enforce this law. Thus, with large numbers of former Confederates now voting, Senter easily defeated Stokes on election day by a vote of 120,333 to 55,036. To address issues over voting and disfranchisement, a new state constitutional convention convened in 1870. This convention, among other things, modified the state constitution to allow all men of at least 21 years of age (whether white or black) to vote, though it also instituted a poll tax, and ordered separate schools for white and black children. The new constitution was approved by a 98,128 to 33,972 vote. Along with voting issues, one of Senter's primary concerns was the state's rising debt. In December 1869, Senter called for prison reform, arguing that prisons had become a financial drain on the state. Hoping to encourage immigration into the state and increase property tax revenues, Senter established the Tennessee Immigration and Labor Association in February 1871. He also favored initiatives to help railroads struggling to pay interest on state-issued bonds. In 1870, Senter used his influence to help establish Hamblen County, which was created from parts of Grainger, Jefferson, and Hawkins counties. Senter's home was located within the new county.

Senter's policies, which allowed Democrats to regain control of the state, angered the state's Republicans, and effectively ended his political career. He spent his remaining years managing his large farm near Morristown. He died on June 14, 1898, and is buried in Morristown's Emma Jarnagin Cemetery. Family Senter married Harriet Senter (a distant cousin) in 1859. She was the daughter of Grainger County's circuit court clerk, P.M. Senter. They had no children.

CUPE is the largest union in Canada, representing some 700,000 workers in health care, education, municipalities, libraries, universities, social services, public utilities, transportation, emergency services and airlines. Over 60% of CUPE's members are women, and almost a third are part-time workers. CUPE is affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress and is its greatest financial contributor. History CUPE was formed in 1963 in a fashion resembling industrial unionism by merging the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) and the National Union of Public Service Employees (NUPSE). The first national president was Stan Little, who had previously been the president of NUPSE. Having led public sector unionism through a period where almost no workers had the right to strike, Little has been credited with bringing public sector unions \\"from collective begging to collective bargaining.\\" By the time of Little's retirement, CUPE had already grown to 210,000 members and had eclipsed United Steelworkers as the largest affiliate to the Canadian Labour Congress. Little was followed in 1975 by Grace Hartman, a feminist activist who was the first woman to lead a major labour union in North America. Hartman led CUPE to involve itself in broader struggles for social justice and equality, and emphasized the role of social unionism, as opposed to the more conservative business unionism practised by many North American unions. She was arrested for leading Ontario hospital workers in defying a back-to-work order from the Ontario Supreme Court in 1981 and sentenced to 45 days in jail. She retired in 1983. Hartman's successor as president was Jeff Rose, a Toronto city worker. Rose's time as the defining face of CUPE was marked by membership growth from 294,000 to 407,000 members (largely through organizing), a strengthening of CUPE's infrastructure and rank-and-file skills, and his outspoken opposition to Brian Mulroney-era wage restraint, free trade, the GST, privatization, deregulation, and cuts to public services. Under Rose's leadership, CUPE was particularly effective in improving pay and working conditions for women. He stepped down in 1991 after eight years, becoming deputy minister of intergovernmental affairs for the Ontario NDP government. In 1991, Judy Darcy followed Rose and became the defining face of CUPE. One of Canada's most visible and colourful labour leaders, Darcy was a vigorous opponent of privatization, two-tier health care, and free trade agreements. Darcy was firmly committed to the union's involvement in broader social issues, and under her tenure CUPE strongly attacked the invasion of Iraq, condemned Canada's involvement in ballistic missile defense, and spoke out loudly in favour of same-sex marriage. Darcy stepped down in 2003 after 12 years as president, and was replaced by Paul Moist. Internal organization CUPE has an extremely decentralized structure, in which each local elects its own executive, sets its own dues structure, conducts its own bargaining and strike votes, and sends delegates to division and national conventions to form overarching policy. Advocates of this system claim that it places the power in the grassroots where it belongs; critics believe that it makes it difficult for it to organize concerted action and leaves the union highly balkanized with policies and strategies varying widely from local to local and sector to sector. This decentralized structure is often described as \\"CUPE's greatest strength and its greatest weakness.\\" This political decentralization is mirrored by an organizational decentralization. Although CUPE has a national headquarters in Ottawa, it is relatively small‚Äîthe vast majority of its staff are scattered across over 70 offices across the country. CUPE locals are affiliated directly to the National body, and affiliation in Provincial CUPE bodies is optional. CUPE National provides locals with support and assistance through National Representatives, who are employees of CUPE National. National Representatives are assigned to specific locals to assist the democratically elected officers of CUPE locals in various aspects of the operation and functioning of the local union. They primarily assist in more complex issues, such as conducting Grievance Arbitrations, bargaining, disability/accommodation issues, human rights, preparation of legal documents, local elections and education. National Representatives also have authority to place a CUPE local under administration, pursuant to the CUPE Constitution, which effectively means that the Representative runs the local for a brief period of time in an extraordinary circumstance and suspends the locally elected officers, usually only in very serious cases of fraud or gross incompetence or misconduct. In addition to servicing National Representatives, CUPE National employs Research Representatives and Legal & Legislative Representatives, who provide research and legal support to locals through their servicing representatives. Nationally there are two full-time political positions‚Äîthe National President (currently Mark Hancock), and the National Secretary-Treasurer (currently Charles Fleury). Provincial divisions CUPE divisions are the political voice of members in their respective provinces, and an integral part of CUPE. Chartered through the national union, each division advocates and campaigns at the provincial level for legislative, policy and political change in the interests of CUPE members and the communities they serve. Each provincial division is led by a democratically elected president, secretary-treasurer and executive board, who are directed by members at annual conventions (biennial in Quebec). Provincial organizations do not provide any servicing or support to the locals on specific operational items, focusing primarily on provincial lobbying, policy development and union education. Internal labour relations CUPE's employees have organized into two main bargaining units. The Canadian Staff Union (CSU) is the larger of the groups. It represents National Representatives and specialist staff in Area and Region Offices across the 10 Regions of CUPE. In 2008 CSU absorbed the Administrative and Technical Staff Union which represented about 60 administrative and technical staff at the Ottawa National Office. The Canadian Office and Professional Employees union (COPE) Local 491 represents support staff workers in the National, regional and area offices of CUPE. Additionally, a handful of CUPE Locals have dedicated CUPE staff working in their own offices.

He served a short prison sentence for his role in the Watergate break-in and the subsequent Watergate scandal and cover-up. Oddly, LaRue had no rank, title, salary, or even listing in the White House directory.Patricia Sullivan, \\"Watergate 'Bagman' Fred LaRue, 75, Dies\\", Washington Post, July 29, 2004. LaRue was present at an early meeting with his friend, United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, at which the Watergate burglary was planned. Afterwards, LaRue assisted the cover-up, supervising the shredding of documents and the destruction of financial records. Biography LaRue was a son of Isaac Parsons and Ruth (Quickenstedt) LaRue. His father later went to prison for violating banking laws, and, upon his release, made a fortune in the oil business. Fred LaRue sold one of their Mississippi oil fields for a reported $30 million in 1957. = Accidentally shoots his father dead = Later in 1957, LaRue accidentally shot and killed his father while hunting with friends in Canada.https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/29/politics/29larueobit.html =Business interests in pre-1959 Havana casinos and Las Vegas= With his newfound wealth, LaRue invested in many failed business ventures including casinos in Havana, Cuba, prior to the communist revolution, and in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also used his wealth to become a political financier and served as a member of the Republican National Committee from 1963 until 1968. =Associated with Senators Goldwater, Eastland and Thurmond= He was a heavy financial contributor to Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964. He was also a longtime friend of the Mississippi Democratic U.S. Senator James Eastland.Caro, Robert: Master of the Senate, p. 102‚Äì103 and p. 867. After Goldwater lost the election, LaRue began getting involved with Nixon's career. LaRue was one of the principal planners of Nixon's so-called \\"Southern strategy\\" for winning the election. He coordinated with the campaign office of Strom Thurmond, the veteran U.S. Senator from South Carolina. =Nixon supporter, advisor to Attorney General John Mitchell= LaRue also recommended the use of a \\"special ballad-type song in the current 'country-and-western music style, by which nationally famous artists will sing the message via the radio and TV.\\" The song was called \\"Bring Our Country Back\\" and included \\"alternate\\" lyrics with the couplet: \\"Dick Nixon is a decent man/Who can bring our country back.\\" LaRue proposed broadcasting the song by local radio and television programs throughout the South. However, he had difficulty finding artists to perform the song; most that he contacted either sympathized with George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, or did not want to help Nixon. Eventually, LaRue managed to convince Roy Acuff and Tex Ritter, who were unsuccessful Republican candidates themselves for governor and U.S. senator, respectively, in the state of Tennessee, to perform versions of the song. LaRue coordinated with Eastland to obtain the confirmation of Nixon's judicial nominees. He has been described as a special assistant in an \\"advisory capacity\\" to then Attorney General Mitchell. On March 30, 1972, LaRue attended a meeting in Key Biscayne, Florida, with Mitchell and Jeb Magruder. Mitchell, having announced his resignation as attorney general on February 15, assumed his new duties as head of the Committee to Re-elect the President, effective on March 1. The March 30 meeting has been the subject of great dispute among its three participants. According to Magruder, the three men approved the so- called Operation Gemstone and other aspects of a \\"dirty tricks\\" campaign against the Democratic Party. LaRue and Mitchell, to their deaths, always denied this vehemently. In 2003, Magruder stated, for the first time, that it was at this meeting that President Nixon, speaking to Mitchell by telephone, voiced specific approval for the Watergate burglary. Mitchell and Nixon had both been dead for years, and Fred LaRue denied Magruder's claim publicly. 'Bagman' for Watergate burglary pay-off LaRue was known as the \\"bagman\\" because he delivered more than $300,000 in cash (\\"hush money\\") to the conspirators and their attorneys to keep participants of the Watergate burglary quiet. LaRue was the first Administration official to plead guilty to crimes related to his involvement with the Watergate burglary and the cover- up. =Jailed for obstruction of justice= He pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in July 1973 and served four and a half months in custody at the Maxwell Air Force Base near Montgomery, Alabama. LaRue's fellow Watergate- convicts John Mitchell and Charles Colson also served their prison time at Maxwell AFB. =Life after prison= LaRue refused to testify against Nixon or any other Watergate figure. One of Nixon's first public appearances after his resignation as president came three years later in 1977 at a \\"Salute to the Military\\" in Biloxi, directed by LaRue. LaRue died in Biloxi, Mississippi, and was cremated. He was survived by his wife, Joyce Burleson LaRue, and six children.

The inclusion of the epithet Irish is a late addition. The \\"Irish bull\\" is to the sense of a statement what the dangling participle is to the syntax, or, in other words, a jarring or amusing absurdity is created by hastiness or lack of attention to speech or writing. Although, strictly speaking, Irish bulls are so structured semantically as to be logically meaningless, their actual effect upon listeners is usually to give vivid illustrations to obvious truths. Hence, as John Pentland Mahaffy, Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, famously observed, \\"an Irish bull is always pregnant\\", i.e. with truthful meaning.Rabkin, Eric S. Taking the bull (by the horns?) The Michigan Alumnus, Volume 99 UM Libraries, 1992 p.18 The \\"father\\" of the Irish bull is often said to be Sir Boyle Roche, who once asked \\"Why should we put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?\\". Roche may have been Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop. Yogi Berra and Samuel Goldwyn were famous American mis-speakers. The Irish bull can be a potent form of self-conscious equivocation and satire in the hands of a wit's sharp tongue. As such, it is associated particularly with new or marginalized populations, such as the Irish in Britain in the nineteenth century, or the Jews and Germans in America in the early twentieth century.  Origin  The derivation of \\"bull\\" in this sense is unclear. It may be related to Old French boul \\"fraud, deceit, trickery\\", Icelandic bull \\"nonsense\\", Middle English bull \\"falsehood\\", or the verb bull \\"befool, mock, cheat\\".Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \\"bull, n. 4\\" (subscription needed). The Irish were supposedly peculiarly prone to such expressions due to their volubility, their taste for colourful metaphors, and their ignorance (or conversely excessive command) of the English language. American Jewish humorists have made extensive use of Irish bulls, dating from the period when large numbers of recent Jewish immigrants from Germany or Eastern Europe were present in American cities. This suggests that a similar effect produced the term \\"Irish bull\\", which is partly contemptuous and partly homage. However, as the Oxford English Dictionary points out, the epithet \\"Irish\\" is a more recent addition, the original word bull for such nonsense having been traced back at least to the early 17th century. By the late 19th century the expression Irish bull was well known, but writers were expressing reservations such as: 'But it is a cruel injustice to poor Paddy to speak of the genuine \\"bull\\" as something distinctly Irish, when countless examples of the same kind of blunder, not a whit less startling, are to be found elsewhere.' The passage continues, presenting Scottish, English and French specimens in support.Brown, Marshall; Bulls and Blunders; S. C. Griggs & Co.

He served as Governor of Tennessee from 1849 to 1851, and was United States Minister to Brazil from 1853 to 1857. He fought under Andrew Jackson in the Creek War, the War of 1812 and the Second Seminole War, and commanded the U.S. Fourteenth Infantry in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. His military exploits earned him the nickname, \\"War Horse of Sumner County.\\"Notes on William Trousdale, Tennessee Portrait Project. Retrieved: 28 September 2012. Early life Trousdale was born in Orange County, North Carolina, the son of James and Elizabeth Dobbins Trousdale. His father was of Scots-Irish descent, and had served in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. His father was given a land grant as payment for services in the Revolution, and used this grant to acquire several hundred acres in Sumner County, Tennessee.J. A. Trousdale, \\"A History of the Life of General William Trousdale,\\" Tennessee Historical Magazine, Vol. 2 (1916), pp. 119-136. The family moved to this plot in 1796. In 1801, the family donated part of their land for the establishment of a new county seat for Sumner County, which was named Gallatin. Trousdale attended public schools and studied under a tutor, the Reverend Gideon Blackburn. Military service and early political endeavors Trousdale joined Captain William Edwards's Mounted Riflemen in 1812. When this company was called into service during the Creek War the following year, Trousdale was elected Lieutenant. The company saw action at the Battle of Tallushatchee and the Battle of Talladega before returning home. In the Summer of 1814, after Trousdale had been at home for just a few months, he joined a militia company formed by Lieutenant-Colonel George Elliott. This company joined Jackson's invasion of Florida later that year. At the Battle of Pensacola in November 1814, Trousdale took part in a charge that captured several cannons on the first day of fighting. He volunteered to be among the first wave of soldiers to assault Fort San Miguel, but the fort surrendered before the assault took place. Following the capture of Pensacola, Trousdale's unit hurried westward with Jackson's forces to defend New Orleans from an impending British invasion. They arrived in the city in December 1814, and Trousdale took part in a series of firefights and night skirmishes against the British on December 23, December 27, and January 1. He fought in the decisive Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815. After the war, Trousdale returned home and studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1820, and commenced practice in Sumner County. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1827 and 1829, and served on Gallatin's Board of Aldermen from 1831 to 1835. He was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1835, and served until the following year. At the outbreak of the Second Seminole War in 1836, Trousdale formed his own company, and was elected colonel of the Second Regiment, First Brigade. His regiment took part in several skirmishes, and helped defeat Seminole forces at the Battle of Wahoo Swamp in November 1836. In 1837, Trousdale once again ran for Congress for the 6th District congressional seat, but lost to William B. Campbell, his former subordinate in the Seminole War and his future gubernatorial opponent. He ran again in 1839 and 1845, but being a Democrat in a primarily Whig district, he was never successful. Trousdale campaigned for the unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate, Martin Van Buren, in 1840. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Trousdale joined the Army with the rank of Colonel, and commanded the 14th U.S. Infantry. This regiment landed at Veracruz on June 13, 1847, and was placed under General Gideon Pillow's 3rd Division. Trousdale's forces linked up with Winfield Scott's forces on July 8, and began the march inland to Mexico City. Trousdale took part in the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco on August 20, and was grazed in the shoulder while fighting in the Battle of Molino del Rey on September 8. Trousdale commanded two regiments (the 14th and 11th) and an artillery battery at the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13. During this battle, his right arm was shattered by enemy fire, though he continued fighting, and managed to lead a charge that captured an enemy cannon. For his actions at Chapultepec, Trousdale was brevetted to brigadier general by President James K. Polk on August 23, 1848. Governor and later political endeavors In 1849, Trousdale received the Democratic nomination for governor. His Whig opponent, Neill S. Brown, had been opposed to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and was struggling with divisions over the issue of slavery in the national Whig Party. Trousdale, on the other hand, was riding a wave of popularity for his service in the war. As a result, Trousdale edged Brown by 1,400 votes in the general election.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 121‚Äì125. In Trousdale's reelection campaign in 1851, his opponent was William B. Campbell, a fellow Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War hero who had served under Trousdale in the Second Seminole War, and had defeated Trousdale for the 6th District congressional seat in 1837 and 1839. Like Brown in 1849, Trousdale's campaign was damaged by the actions of his own party. At the Nashville Convention in 1850, which Trousdale had endorsed, southern Democrats called for secession should the United States implement the Wilmot Proviso, banning slavery in territory acquired as a result of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Secession was unpopular in Tennessee at the time, and following a relatively dignified campaign, Campbell defeated Trousdale by 1,500 votes. In 1853, Trousdale was appointed \\"Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary\\" to Brazil by President Franklin Pierce. He arrived in Rio de Janeiro in July 1853, and served until 1857. He spent much of his term advocating the opening of the Amazon River to international commerce. After returning to Sumner County, Trousdale spent the remainder of his life practicing law. He was consistently stricken with rheumatism, creating physical difficulties that prevented him from taking part in public life, as well as from serving in the Civil War in the 1860s. He nevertheless supported the Confederacy, and refused to take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States, even when Union soldiers occupied his home. Family Trousdale was married to Mary Ann Bugg in 1827. The couple had seven children. Death Trousdale died on March 27, 1872, and is interred at Gallatin City Cemetery in Gallatin, Tennessee. Legacy Trousdale County, Tennessee is named in his honor. His family home, the Federal-style \\"Trousdale Place\\" located near the town square of Gallatin, has been a preserved historical site since 1900.

Biography Neubauer's father, Karl Neubauer, was a furniture-maker in Neutitschein, which then was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Karl christened his only son Alfred, but the child quickly became known to family and friends as Friedl. Neubauer used to repair motor vehicles while he was an officer during his service in the Imperial Austrian army. After the First World War, he joined the Austrian car manufacturer Austro-Daimler, where Ferdinand Porsche appointed him to be chief tester. From 1922 onwards, Neubauer also drove in races, although without any great success. In 1923, when Ferdinand Porsche moved to the Daimler Works at Stuttgart (Daimler-Benz was not founded until 1926), he took Neubauer with him. In 1926, recognizing that he himself was not a great racing driver, Neubauer got an inspiration that let him create the position of racing team manager (Rennleiter). Racing drivers in those days being isolated from the outside, they often did not know their position in a race. Occasionally a driver would learn that he had won after a race merely by surprise. To overcome this situation, Alfred Neubauer devised a well thought-out system, with flags and boards, to give his drivers more tactical information. When he tried out the system for the first time at the 1926 Solituderennen on 12 September 1926, the chief steward demanded angrily that he leave the track, since his 'antics' were irritating the drivers. To Neubauer's explanation that he was the Rennleiter, the organizer responded: ‚ÄòAre you mad? I‚Äôm the Rennleiter‚Äô. The Mercedes-Benz team was soon winning races with SS and SSK racing cars, frequently in the hands of Rudolf Caracciola, the best driver during those days. Neubauer's contribution lay not just in his tactical skill, but also in the perfectionistical, almost military drill of the pit crew, which constantly gave the team a time advantage over its rivals. Neubauer's organization at the Mille Miglia in 1931 was a master stroke. To reach each staging post before Caracciola arrived, he repeatedly criss-crossed Italy with his team. According to Neubauer, the origin of the Silver Arrows phrase was due to the cars being overweighted at their first race. Neubauer's story states that the rules prescribed a weight limit of 750 kg, whilst one day before the new cars' first race they weighed in at 751 kg. This led to Neubauer and Manfred von Brauchitsch eventually coming up with the idea of removing the cars' white paint. The silver-coloured aluminium bodywork was exposed, and the Silver Arrows were born. However, this story is a fabrication by Neubauer himself, a well-known raconteur. The debut race was run to Formula Libre rules, meaning there was no weight limit. Additionally, there are no reports or photographs from the time suggesting that the cars were ever run in white paint., and (accessed on 10. March 2010) Silver Arrows The Silver Arrows years were dominated by German racing cars and the rivalry between Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union. In its most successful phase, the Mercedes-Benz team's regular drivers were Rudolf Caracciola, Hermann Lang, Manfred von Brauchitsch, and Richard Seaman. After the Second World War, Mercedes-Benz was anxious to return to racing as soon as possible, but a new formula was announced for 1954, and there was insufficient time to produce a new model. As a compromise solution, the design of the Mercedes-Benz 300 was adapted. This resulted in a new racing car, the Mercedes-Benz 300SL. With this car, Neubauer achieved victories at the Carrera Panamericana and the Le Mans 24-hour race. When Mercedes-Benz cars returned to Grand Prix racing in 1954, the new Silver Arrows proved to be much superior to those produced before the war. Juan Manuel Fangio was World Champion in 1954 and 1955. Probably Neubauer's worst day as racing manager was at Le Mans in 1955, when a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR driven by Frenchman Pierre Levegh, was catapulted into the crowd, killing more than 80 people. After consultation with Stuttgart, Neubauer withdrew the remaining cars from the event. After the shock of Le Mans, Mercedes-Benz withdrew from racing altogether, and Alfred Neubauer retired.

More concretely, a Lie algebra is reductive if it is a direct sum of a semisimple Lie algebra and an abelian Lie algebra: \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{s} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{a}; there are alternative characterizations, given below.  Examples  The most basic example is the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{gl}_n of n \\\\times n matrices with the commutator as Lie bracket, or more abstractly as the endomorphism algebra of an n-dimensional vector space, \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V). This is the Lie algebra of the general linear group GL(n), and is reductive as it decomposes as \\\\mathfrak{gl}_n = \\\\mathfrak{sl}_n \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{k}, corresponding to traceless matrices and scalar matrices. Any semisimple Lie algebra or abelian Lie algebra is a fortiori reductive. Over the real numbers, compact Lie algebras are reductive.  Definitions  A Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} over a field of characteristic 0 is called reductive if any of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied: # The adjoint representation (the action by bracketing) of \\\\mathfrak{g} is completely reducible (a direct sum of irreducible representations). # \\\\mathfrak{g} admits a faithful, completely reducible, finite-dimensional representation. # The radical of \\\\mathfrak{g} equals the center: \\\\mathfrak{r}(\\\\mathfrak{g}) = \\\\mathfrak{z}(\\\\mathfrak{g}). #:The radical always contains the center, but need not equal it. # \\\\mathfrak{g} is the direct sum of a semisimple ideal \\\\mathfrak{s}_0 and its center \\\\mathfrak{z}(\\\\mathfrak{g}): \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{s}_0 \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{z}(\\\\mathfrak{g}). #:Compare to the Levi decomposition, which decomposes a Lie algebra as its radical (which is solvable, not abelian in general) and a Levi subalgebra (which is semisimple). # \\\\mathfrak{g} is a direct sum of a semisimple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{s} and an abelian Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{a}: \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{s} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{a}. # \\\\mathfrak{g} is a direct sum of prime ideals: \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\textstyle{\\\\sum \\\\mathfrak{g}_i}. Some of these equivalences are easily seen. For example, the center and radical of \\\\mathfrak{s} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{a} is \\\\mathfrak{a}, while if the radical equals the center the Levi decomposition yields a decomposition \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{s}_0 \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{z}(\\\\mathfrak{g}). Further, simple Lie algebras and the trivial 1-dimensional Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{k} are prime ideals.  Properties  Reductive Lie algebras are a generalization of semisimple Lie algebras, and share many properties with them: many properties of semisimple Lie algebras depend only on the fact that they are reductive. Notably, the unitarian trick of Hermann Weyl works for reductive Lie algebras. The associated reductive Lie groups are of significant interest: the Langlands program is based on the premise that what is done for one reductive Lie group should be done for all. The intersection of reductive Lie algebras and solvable Lie algebras is exactly abelian Lie algebras (contrast with the intersection of semisimple and solvable Lie algebras being trivial).

The Term Days are Whitsunday and Martinmas, and together with Candlemas and Lammas they constitute the Quarter Days. These originally occurred on Christian holy days, corresponding roughly to old quarter days used in both Scotland and Ireland, with White Sunday or Whitsun occurring at the Easter Pentecost and thus moving around. These were mapped from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar and fixed in 1886 as 28 February, 28 May, 28 August and 28 November, and then later ratified by the Term and Quarter Days (Scotland) Act 1990. The Old Scottish Term and Quarter Days (Julian to Gregorian): *Candlemas (2 February) *Whitsunday (15 May) *Lammas (1 August) *Martinmas (11 November) The new Scottish Term and Quarter Days (Gregorian post-1886): * 28 February * 28 May * 28 August * 28 November History Candlemas originally fell on 2 February, the day of the feast of the Purification, or the Presentation of Christ. This was celebrated in pre- Reformation times by candlelit processions. The tradition was started in the 5th century during the Roman celebration of Februa, and carried over into Scotland, where mothers of children born the previous year would march with candles, hoping to be purified by the Virgin Mary. Whitsun was originally the feast of Pentecost, around which a great many christenings would occur, so it became associated with the colour white. Because the date of Pentecost moves each year, the legal Term Day of Whitsun was fixed in Scotland as 26 May in the Julian Calendar, which became 15 May under the Gregorian Calendar, adopted in Scotland in 1599.Vyst, R. K. The Calendar and Related Problems from the Scottish Records Association website. Retrieved 2008-05-23. Lammas was celebrated on 1 August, the day the first fruits of the harvest were offered, the name coming from the Anglo-Saxon for 'loaf-mass' or 'bread-feast'. Martinmas, on 11 November, was originally the feast of Saint Martin of Tours, a 4th-century bishop and hermit. In Scotland, 1886 saw the term dates for removals and the hiring of servants in towns changed to 28 February, 28 May, 28 August and 28 November. The original dates are now referred to as Old Scottish Term Days. The dates were regularised by the Term and Quarter Days (Scotland) Act 1990. Modern use The usage of term days is now virtually obsolete, and any reference to them tends to be historical or ceremonial. The College of Justice (supreme courts of Scotland) no longer uses the term or quarter days to determine the terms of the Court of Session or High Court, instead dividing the legal year into winter (late September to last Friday before Christmas), spring (early January to late March) and summer (late April to early July) terms. In the ancient universities, the academic terms were named after Martinmas, Candlemas and Whitsun, and at the University of St Andrews the two semesters continue to be named Martinmas and Candlemas.

Adventurer could be added to the list of his titles, as he managed to escape besieged Paris by balloon in September 1870. He founded and edited the scientific magazine La Nature and wrote several books. His brother was illustrator Albert Tissandier. His son Paul became a well known aviator in his own right. Biography Gaston & Albert Tissandier in their electrically powered dirigible', 8 October 1883 at Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy in Paris Albert Tissandier (left) and Gaston Tissandier, plus an unidentified man Gaston Tissandier was born in Paris in 1843. He studied chemistry and in 1864 became the head of the experimental laboratory of Union nationales. He was also a teacher at Association polytechnique. His interest in meteorology led him to take up aviation. His first trip in the air was conducted at Calais in 1868 together with , where his balloon drifted out over the sea and was brought back by an air stream of opposite direction in a higher layer of air. In September 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, he managed to leave the besieged Paris by balloon. His most adventurous air trip took place near Paris in April 1875. He and companions , journalist, and , naval officer, were able to reach in a balloon the unheard-of altitude of 8,600 meters (28,000 feet). Both of his companions died from breathing the thin air. Tissandier survived, but became deaf. In 1883, Tissandier fit a Siemens electric motor to an airship, thus creating the first electric-powered flight. Tissandier reported his meteorological observations to the French Academy of Sciences. In 1873 he founded the weekly scientific magazine La Nature, which he edited until 1896, after which it was continued by others. He also authored several books:  Works  * El√©ments de Chimie (1870) * L'Eau (1867) * La Houille (1886) * Histoire de mes ascensions r√©cit de quarante voyages a√©riens (1868-1886) (1887; German edition 1872) * En ballon!

The bell was commissioned by Empress Anna Ivanovna, niece of Peter the Great. It has never been in working order, suspended, or rung. The present bell is sometimes referred to as Kolokol III (Bell III), because it is the third generation. General description The Tsar Bell is located between the Ivan the Great Bell Tower and the Kremlin Wall. Made of bronze, the bell cracked during a fire after being completed and has never been rung. The bell is the largest bell in the world, weighing , with a height of and diameter of , and thickness of up to . The broken piece weighs . At 116 metric tons, the Bell of Good Luck in Foquan Temple, Pingdingshan, Henan, China is the heaviest functioning bell in the world. The bell is decorated with relief images of baroque angels, plants, oval medallions with saints, and nearly life-size images of Empress Anna and Tsar Alexey, who was reigning at the time the previous Tsar Bell was cast. History The history of Russian bell founding goes back to the 10th century, but in the medieval Russian Orthodox Church, bells were not typically rung to indicate church services, but to announce important ceremonies, celebrations, and as an alarm in case of fire or enemy attack. One of the largest of the early bells was the original Tsar Bell, cast in the 16th century. Completed in 1600, it weighed and required 24 men to ring its clapper. Housed in the original wooden Ivan the Great Bell Tower in the Moscow Kremlin, it crashed to the ground in a fire in the mid-17th century and was broken to pieces. The second Tsar Bell was cast in 1655, using the remnants of the former bell, but on a much larger scale. This bell weighed , but was again destroyed by fire in 1701. After becoming Empress, Anna ordered that the pieces be cast into a new bell with its weight increased by another hundred tons, and dispatched the son of Field Marshal M√ºnnich to Paris to solicit technical help from the master craftsmen there. However, a bell of such size was unprecedented, and M√ºnnich was not taken seriously. In 1733, the job was assigned to local foundry masters, Ivan Motorin and his son Mikhail, based on their experience in casting a bronze cannon. A pit deep was dug (near the location of the present bell), with a clay form, and walls reinforced with rammed earth to withstand the pressure of the molten metal. Obtaining the necessary metals proved a challenge, for in addition to the parts of the old bell, an additional of silver and of gold were added to the mixture. After months of preparation, casting work commenced at the end of November 1734. The first attempt was not successful, and the project was incomplete when Ivan Motorin died in August, 1735. His son Mikhail carried on the work, and the second attempt at casting succeeded on November 25, 1735. Ornaments were added as the bell was cooling while raised above the casting pit through 1737. However, before the last ornamentation was completed, a major fire broke out at the Kremlin in May 1737. The fire spread to the temporary wooden support structure for the bell, and fearing damage, guards threw cold water on it, causing eleven cracks, and a huge slab to break off. The fire burned through the wooden supports, and the damaged bell fell back into its casting pit. The Tsar Bell remained in its pit for almost a century. Unsuccessful attempts to raise it were made in 1792 and 1819. Napoleon Bonaparte, during his occupation of Moscow in 1812, considered removing it as a trophy to France, but was unable to do so, due to its size and weight. It was finally successfully raised in the summer of 1836 by the French architect Auguste de Montferrand and placed on a stone pedestal. The broken slab alone is nearly three times larger than the world's largest bell hung for full circle ringing, the tenor bell at Liverpool Cathedral. For a time, the bell served as a chapel, with the broken area forming the door. Voltaire once joked that the Kremlin's two greatest items were a bell which was never rung and a cannon (the Tsar Pushka) that was never fired. Computational simulation of sound In the spring of 2016, a team of UC Berkeley, Stanford, and University of Michigan researchers publicly performed an electronic reproduction of how the Tsar Bell would sound if it had not been damaged during casting. To simulate the sound of the bell, the team researched the bell's material characteristics and constructed a polygon mesh that modeled the shape of the bell. The team then used finite element analysis to compute the component frequencies of the bell when rung. For the first public performance, a stack of twelve speakers installed below the campanile on the UC Berkeley campus played the digital simulation of the Tsar Bell. The fundamental frequency of the sound was approximately 81 Hz.

The space of all possible light rays is given by the five-dimensional plenoptic function, and the magnitude of each ray is given by the radiance. Michael Faraday was the first to propose (in an 1846 lecture entitled \\"Thoughts on Ray Vibrations\\") that light should be interpreted as a field, much like the magnetic fields on which he had been working for several years. The phrase light field was coined by Andrey Gershun in a classic paper on the radiometric properties of light in three-dimensional space (1936). The 5D plenoptic function Radiance L along a ray can be thought of as the amount of light traveling along all possible straight lines through a tube whose size is determined by its solid angle and cross-sectional area. If the concept is restricted to geometric optics‚Äîi.e., to incoherent light and to objects larger than the wavelength of light‚Äîthen the fundamental carrier of light is a ray. The measure for the amount of light traveling along a ray is radiance, denoted by L and measured in watts (W) per steradian (sr) per meter squared (m2). The steradian is a measure of solid angle, and meters squared are used here as a measure of cross-sectional area, as shown at right. 3D space by position (x, y, z) and direction (Œ∏, œï). The radiance along all such rays in a region of three-dimensional space illuminated by an unchanging arrangement of lights is called the plenoptic function (Adelson 1991). The plenoptic illumination function is an idealized function used in computer vision and computer graphics to express the image of a scene from any possible viewing position at any viewing angle at any point in time. It is never actually used in practice computationally, but is conceptually useful in understanding other concepts in vision and graphics (Wong 2002). Since rays in space can be parameterized by three coordinates, x, y, and z and two angles Œ∏ and œï, as shown at left, it is a five-dimensional function, that is, a function over a five-dimensional manifold equivalent to the product of 3D Euclidean space and the 2-sphere. Summing the irradiance vectors D1 and D2 arising from two light sources I1 and I2 produces a resultant vector D having the magnitude and direction shown (Gershun, fig 17). Like Adelson, Gershun defined the light field at each point in space as a 5D function. However, he treated it as an infinite collection of vectors, one per direction impinging on the point, with lengths proportional to their radiances. Integrating these vectors over any collection of lights, or over the entire sphere of directions, produces a single scalar value‚Äîthe total irradiance at that point, and a resultant direction. The figure at right, reproduced from Gershun's paper, shows this calculation for the case of two light sources. In computer graphics, this vector-valued function of 3D space is called the vector irradiance field (Arvo, 1994). The vector direction at each point in the field can be interpreted as the orientation one would face a flat surface placed at that point to most brightly illuminate it. =Higher dimensionality= One can consider time, wavelength, and polarization angle as additional variables, yielding higher-dimensional functions. The 4D light field Radiance along a ray remains constant if there are no blockers. In a plenoptic function, if the region of interest contains a concave object (think of a cupped hand), then light leaving one point on the object may travel only a short distance before being blocked by another point on the object. No practical device could measure the function in such a region. However, if we restrict ourselves to locations outside the convex hull (think shrink-wrap) of the object, i.e. in free space, then we can measure the plenoptic function by taking many photos using a digital camera. Moreover, in this case the function contains redundant information, because the radiance along a ray remains constant from point to point along its length, as shown at left. In fact, the redundant information is exactly one dimension, leaving us with a four- dimensional function (that is, a function of points in a particular four- dimensional manifold). Parry Moon dubbed this function the photic field (1981), while researchers in computer graphics call it the 4D light field (Levoy 1996) or Lumigraph (Gortler 1996). Formally, the 4D light field is defined as radiance along rays in empty space. The set of rays in a light field can be parameterized in a variety of ways, a few of which are shown below. Of these, the most common is the two-plane parameterization shown at right (below). While this parameterization cannot represent all rays, for example rays parallel to the two planes if the planes are parallel to each other, it has the advantage of relating closely to the analytic geometry of perspective imaging. Indeed, a simple way to think about a two-plane light field is as a collection of perspective images of the st plane (and any objects that may lie astride or beyond it), each taken from an observer position on the uv plane. A light field parameterized this way is sometimes called a light slab. Some alternative parameterizations of the 4D light field, which represents the flow of light through an empty region of three- dimensional space. Left: points on a plane or curved surface and directions leaving each point. Center: pairs of points on the surface of a sphere. Right: pairs of points on two planes in general (meaning any) position. =Sound analog= The analog of the 4D light field for sound is the sound field or wave field, as in wave field synthesis, and the corresponding parametrization is the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral, which states that, in the absence of obstacles, a sound field over time is given by the pressure on a plane. Thus this is two dimensions of information at any point in time, and over time a 3D field. This two-dimensionality, compared with the apparent four-dimensionality of light, is because light travels in rays (0D at a point in time, 1D over time), while by Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle, a sound wave front can be modeled as spherical waves (2D at a point in time, 3D over time): light moves in a single direction (2D of information), while sound simply expands in every direction. However, light travelling in non-vacuous media may scatter in a similar fashion, and the irreversibility or information lost in the scattering is discernible in the apparent loss of a system dimension. Ways to create light fields Light fields are a fundamental representation for light. As such, there are as many ways of creating light fields as there are computer programs capable of creating images or instruments capable of capturing them. In computer graphics, light fields are typically produced either by rendering a 3D model or by photographing a real scene. In either case, to produce a light field views must be obtained for a large collection of viewpoints. Depending on the parameterization employed, this collection will typically span some portion of a line, circle, plane, sphere, or other shape, although unstructured collections of viewpoints are also possible (Buehler 2001). Devices for capturing light fields photographically may include a moving handheld camera or a robotically controlled camera (Levoy 2002), an arc of cameras (as in the bullet time effect used in The Matrix), a dense array of cameras (Kanade 1998; Yang 2002; Wilburn 2005), handheld cameras (Ng 2005; Georgiev 2006; Marwah 2013), microscopes (Levoy 2006), or other optical system (Bolles 1987). How many images should be in a light field? The largest known light field (of Michelangelo's statue of Night) contains 24,000 1.3-megapixel images. At a deeper level, the answer depends on the application. For light field rendering (see the Application section below), if you want to walk completely around an opaque object, then of course you need to photograph its back side. Less obviously, if you want to walk close to the object, and the object lies astride the st plane, then you need images taken at finely spaced positions on the uv plane (in the two-plane parameterization shown above), which is now behind you, and these images need to have high spatial resolution. The number and arrangement of images in a light field, and the resolution of each image, are together called the \\"sampling\\" of the 4D light field. Analyses of light field sampling have been undertaken by many researchers; a good starting point is Chai (2000). Also of interest is Durand (2005) for the effects of occlusion, Ramamoorthi (2006) for the effects of lighting and reflection, and Ng (2005) and Zwicker (2006) for applications to plenoptic cameras and 3D displays, respectively. Applications Computational imaging refers to any image formation method that involves a digital computer. Many of these methods operate at visible wavelengths, and many of those produce light fields. As a result, listing all applications of light fields would require surveying all uses of computational imaging in art, science, engineering, and medicine. In computer graphics, some selected applications are: A downward-facing light source (F-F') induces a light field whose irradiance vectors curve outwards. Using calculus, Gershun could compute the irradiance falling on points (P1, P2) on a surface. (Gershun, fig 24) * Illumination engineering: Gershun's reason for studying the light field was to derive (in closed form if possible) the illumination patterns that would be observed on surfaces due to light sources of various shapes positioned above these surface. An example is shown at right. A more modern study is (Ashdown 1993). :The branch of optics devoted to illumination engineering is nonimaging optics (Chaves 2015; Winston 2005). It extensively uses the concept of flow lines (Gershun's flux lines) and vector flux (Gershun's light vector). However, the light field (in this case the positions and directions defining the light rays) is commonly described in terms of phase space and Hamiltonian optics. * Light field rendering: By extracting appropriate 2D slices from the 4D light field of a scene, one can produce novel views of the scene (Levoy 1996; Gortler 1996). Depending on the parameterization of the light field and slices, these views might be perspective, orthographic, crossed-slit (Zomet 2003), general linear cameras (Yu and McMillan 2004), multi-perspective (Rademacher 1998), or another type of projection. Light field rendering is one form of image-based rendering. * Synthetic aperture photography: By integrating an appropriate 4D subset of the samples in a light field, one can approximate the view that would be captured by a camera having a finite (i.e., non-pinhole) aperture. Such a view has a finite depth of field. By shearing or warping the light field before performing this integration, one can focus on different fronto-parallel (Isaksen 2000) or oblique (Vaish 2005) planes in the scene. If a digital camera was able to capture the light field (Ng 2005), its photographs would allow being refocused after they are taken. * 3D display: By presenting a light field using technology that maps each sample to the appropriate ray in physical space, one obtains an autostereoscopic visual effect akin to viewing the original scene. Non-digital technologies for doing this include integral photography, parallax panoramagrams, and holography; digital technologies include placing an array of lenslets over a high- resolution display screen, or projecting the imagery onto an array of lenslets using an array of video projectors. If the latter is combined with an array of video cameras, one can capture and display a time-varying light field. This essentially constitutes a 3D television system (Javidi 2002; Matusik 2004). * Brain imaging: Neural activity can be recorded optically by genetically encoding neurons with reversible fluorescent markers e.g. GCaMP that indicate the presence of calcium ions in real time. Since Light field microscopy captures full volume information in a single frame, it is possible to monitor neural activity in many individual neurons randomly distributed in a large volume at video framerate (Grosenick, 2009, 2017; Perez, 2015). A quantitative measurement of neural activity can even be done despite optical aberrations in brain tissue and without reconstructing a volume image (Pegard, 2016), and be used to monitor activity in thousands of neurons in a behaving mammal (Grosenick, 2017). Image generation and predistortion of synthetic imagery for holographic stereograms is one of the earliest examples of computed light fields, anticipating and later motivating the geometry used in Levoy and Hanrahan's work (Halle 1991, 1994). Modern approaches to light field display explore co-designs of optical elements and compressive computation to achieve higher resolutions, increased contrast, wider fields of view, and other benefits (Wetzstein 2012, 2011; Lanman 2011, 2010). * Glare reduction: Glare arises due to multiple scattering of light inside the camera's body and lens optics and reduces image contrast. While glare has been analyzed in 2D image space (Talvala 2007), it is useful to identify it as a 4D ray-space phenomenon (Raskar 2008). By statistically analyzing the ray-space inside a camera, one can classify and remove glare artifacts. In ray-space, glare behaves as high frequency noise and can be reduced by outlier rejection. Such analysis can be performed by capturing the light field inside the camera, but it results in the loss of spatial resolution. Uniform and non-uniform ray sampling could be used to reduce glare without significantly compromising image resolution (Raskar 2008).

He served as Secretary of State for the state of Tennessee from 1862 to 1865, having been appointed by Andrew Johnson, the state's military governor under the Union Army occupation during the Civil War. East briefly served as the state's acting governor during the interim between Johnson's inauguration as U.S. Vice President on March 4, 1865, and the inauguration of the state's \\"elected\\" governor, William G. Brownlow, on April 5, 1865. Life and career East was born in Davidson County, Tennessee, one of ten children of Edward Hyde East and Celia Buchanan East. His paternal grandfather, Benjamin East, had migrated from England in the 18th century. His father served as a justice of the peace for Davidson County, and was a supporter of Whig presidential candidate Hugh Lawson White in 1836. East enrolled in Washington Institute in Nashville in the late 1840s, and graduated with a degree in literature in 1850. He then studied law at the Cumberland University Law School (now the Cumberland School of Law), graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1854. Afterward, he practiced law in Nashville. In 1859, East, a lifelong Whig, was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives as a member of the Opposition Party (which the state's Whigs had formed after the collapse of the national Whig Party). In the months leading up to the Civil War, East steadfastly opposed secession. When the state began to align itself with the Confederacy, he resigned his seat. While he supported the Union, he refused to take up arms against the South, and retired from public life. In March 1862, the Union Army occupied Nashville, and former governor Andrew Johnson was appointed military governor of the state. Shortly afterward, Johnson set up a cabinet: East was appointed Secretary of State, Joseph S. Fowler was appointed Comptroller, and Horace Maynard was appointed Attorney General.James Patton, Unionism and Reconstruction in Tennessee (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1934), pp. 34, 84, 89. When Johnson was elected Vice President on Lincoln's ticket in November 1864, authorities realized there would be a month between Johnson's inauguration as Vice President on March 4, 1865, and the inauguration of William G. Brownlow as governor on April 5. Several of Lincoln's advisors suggested he appoint Brownlow military governor for this interim, but Lincoln chose to allow East to continue as acting governor.Eric McKitrick, Andrew Johnson and Reconstruction (University of Chicago Press, 1960), p. 136n. The official Tennessee Blue Book does not recognize East's governorship and does not include East in its official list of former governors. When Johnson became president following Lincoln's assassination, he asked East to serve in his cabinet, but East declined. East served as chancellor for Davidson County from 1869 to 1870, and chancellor for the state's Seventh Division (created by the 1870 state constitution) from 1870 to 1872.Charles Miller, The Official and Political Manual of the State of Tennessee (Nashville: Marshall and Bruce Stationers, 1890), p. 186. Afterward, he worked as counsel for the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. In 1874, East was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, and served as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. As such, he was instrumental in convincing the state to acknowledge and resolve its debt issues. The state's Greenback Party nominated East as their candidate for governor in 1878, but he declined the nomination. In 1892, East ran for governor on the Prohibition Party ticket,Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), p. 216. but placed a distant fourth behind Democrat Peter Turney, Republican George W. Winstead, and Farm-Labor incumbent John P. Buchanan.Our Campaigns - TN Governor 1892. Retrieved: 17 October 2012. Death East died in Davidson County on November 12, 1904. He is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville. Family life and public service \\"Mrs Edward H East\\" East was the second husband of Ida Horton. Edward and Ida had two daughters, Edine and Bessie. Ida was active in the Temperance movement. East served on the inaugural Board of Trust of Vanderbilt University. He was also president of the Board of Trust for the Tennessee School for the Blind in Nashville, and president of the Board of Directors for the Tennessee Hospital for the Insane. In 1880, he was awarded an honorary LL.D from the University of Nashville. East represented the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, at the Methodist Ecumenical Council in London in 1881.

Biography = Early life and education = Age 21 in 1959 Per Brinch Hansen was born in Frederiksberg, an enclave surrounded by Copenhagen, Denmark. His father, J√∏rgen Brinch Hansen, worked as a civil engineer, becoming a leading expert in soil mechanics, and later accepting a professorship at Technical University of Denmark. His mother, Elsebeth Brinch Hansen (n√©e Ring), was the daughter of Danish composer Oluf Ring and worked as a hairdresser before marrying. Brinch Hansen attended St. J√∏rgens Gymnasium and then studied electrical engineering at Technical University of Denmark where he sought an area to pursue that \\"was still in its pioneering phase\\" on the belief that \\"If a subject was being taught, it was probably already too late to make fundamental contributions.\\" After a seven-week student internship at IBM's Hursley Laboratory in England, he decided to dedicate his career to computers. Initially focused on computer construction, reading a book on IBM's Project Stretch that described computer organization from a programmer's point of view refocused his interest toward becoming a computer architect. = Regnecentralen = At age 29, in the RC 4000 computer lab (1967) After completing a master's degree in electronic engineering in 1963, Brinch Hansen landed a job at Regnecentralen, then a research institution under , working in the compiler group, led by Peter Naur and J√∏rn Jensen. There, his first significant project was writing a parser for a COBOL compiler for the Siemens 3003 computer. Subsequently, he wrote a file system to be used during execution of the compiled COBOL programs, later observing: In 1966, Brinch Hansen moved to Henning Isaksson's hardware group in Regnecentralen, now a company with shareholders. Together with Peter Kraft, he defined the architecture and instruction set for Regnecentralen's third computer, the RC 4000, using Algol 60 as a hardware definition language to produce a formal specification. Inexperienced with multiprogramming, he used a copy of Cooperating Sequential Processes Edsger Dijkstra had sent him to understand process synchronization using semaphores, and then implemented a specialized RC 4000 real-time monitor for use in managing a fertilizer plant. Peter Kraft and a then-teenaged Charles Simonyi wrote a p-code interpreter and data logging task programs that were compiled to p-code. In the summer of 1967, Brinch Hansen left Regnecentralen's hardware group to become head of RC 4000 software development, where he led a team including J√∏rn Jensen, Peter Kraft and S√∏ren Lauesen in defining a general-purpose RC 4000 multiprogramming system, with a goal to avoid developing a custom real-time control operating system for every RC 4000 installation, and to support batch processing and time-sharing as well. The resulting system was not a complete operating system, but a small kernel providing the mechanisms upon which operating systems for different purposes could be built. By the spring of 1969, a well- documented, reliable version of the RC 4000 multiprogramming system was running. = Carnegie Mellon University = In late 1970, Brinch Hansen moved to Pittsburgh, accepting an invitation from Alan Perlis to visit the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University as a research associate, while he wrote the first systematic textbook on operating system principles. During this time, at the 1971 Summer School in Marktoberdorf and a symposium in Belfast, Brinch Hansen, Tony Hoare and Dijkstra began to discuss ideas that evolved into the monitor concept. In the spring of 1972, after reading about the class concept invented by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard for Simula 67, Brinch Hansen completed his text with a chapter on resource protection that proposed the first monitor notation, using shared classes. In 1973, Operating System Principles was published, becoming the first comprehensive textbook on operating systems. = California Institute of Technology = At the Taj Mahal, after attending a conference in Bombay (1975) In July 1972, Brinch Hansen joined the faculty of Caltech as an Associate Professor of computer science, where he began work on defining a programming language with concurrent processes and monitors. In April 1974, he distributed a technical report on Concurrent Pascal. A Concurrent Pascal compiler for the PDP 11/45, written by Brinch Hansen's doctoral student, Al Hartmann, was released in January 1975. Subsequently, Brinch Hansen began writing model operating systems in Concurrent Pascal, to evaluate the language. In May 1975, he completed Solo, a single-user operating system for development of Concurrent Pascal programs. Next, he rewrote the original RC 4000 real-time scheduler in Concurrent Pascal, taking three days to write it, and three hours of machine time to systematically test it. When the Caltech computer science department shifted focus toward computer engineering and away from programming Brinch Hansen decided to leave, rather than to seek tenure there. = University of Southern California = In 1976, Brinch Hansen chose USC for his next post, so that his family could remain in their Altadena home. Joining the faculty as a tenured full professor, and first chair of a newly created computer science department, he led efforts to identify and attract top-notch faculty to build a first rate department. By 1980, USC's computer science department was ranked by the National Research Council as one of the top ten in the US. While at USC, Brinch Hansen wrote his second book, The Architecture of Concurrent Programs, based on his work developing operating systems with Concurrent Pascal. Published in 1977, it was the first book on concurrent programming. In 1978, Brinch Hansen became the first computer scientist awarded the Doctor Technices degree, the highest academic distinction within engineering and technological science in Denmark, for the work documented in The Architecture of Concurrent Programs. Later in 1978, Brinch Hansen published the Distributed Processes language concept, proposing the use of remote procedure calls to synchronize processes running across a microcomputer network. Also in 1978, L. J. Sevins and Steve Goings from Mostek visited Brinch Hansen at USC, where he outlined a low-cost multiprocessor architecture. Mostek began a project to implement such a multiprocessor, with Brinch Hansen working as a consultant. Brinch Hansen developed a new concurrent programming language, Edison, for the project. As with the RC 4000 project, Edison was also used as a formal specification language for the hardware. Mostek got an initial 4-node multiprocessor working and Brinch Hansen wrote a portable Edison compiler on a PDP 11/55, but shortly after, United Technologies acquired Mostek and cancelled the project. In 1982, Brinch Hansen moved the Edison system to an IBM PC, and then published his third book, Programming a Personal Computer. In 1982, Brinch Hansen was named the first Henry Salvatori Professor of Computer Science at USC. = University of Copenhagen = In 1984, feeling homesick for Denmark after fourteen years abroad, Brinch Hansen left USC and joined the faculty of the University of Copenhagen as a Professor of datalogy. In 1985, he was elected a Fellow of the IEEE. Later in 1985, his fourth book Brinch Hansen on Pascal Compilers, which he used for his own compiler course, was published. While designing a multicomputer operating system for Danish company GN Elmi, Brinch Hansen concluded he needed a new language, this time leveraging the message passing paradigm of Hoare's CSP. The resulting language, Joyce, removed a major limitation of CSP by introducing parallel recursion. Brinch Hansen developed a portable implementation on an IBM PC. = Syracuse University = On vacation in Washington, D.C. (1990) After finding that neither he nor his family felt at home in Denmark, Brinch Hansen decided to return to the US, but discovered that their immigration status required them to do so very quickly. Brinch Hansen contacted John Reynolds at Syracuse University and in 1987 he joined the faculty as a Distinguished Professor. Working with his student Rangachari Anand, Joyce was moved to an Encore Multimax 320 multiprocessor at SU's Northeast Parallel Architectures Center. Recognizing the scaling limitations of multiprocessors, however, Brinch Hansen sought a suitable multicomputer for further work. Acquiring a Meiko Computing Surface in 1989, he began experimenting with scientific applications by developing parallel programs for Householder reduction and then n-body simulation as learning exercises, and was surprised to find that both programs had nearly identical control structures. Concluding that both fit an \\"all-pairs paradigm,\\" he then focused on exploring reusable parallel algorithm structures he termed \\"programming paradigms\\" or \\"generic programs\\" (later, popularly known as \\"design patterns\\"). In 1995, Brinch Hansen's fifth book, Studies in Computational Science: Parallel Programming Paradigms was published, with programs rewritten in SuperPascal, a fully implemented publication language he created for parallel algorithms. = Last years = In his later years, Brinch Hansen published a retrospective of his most important papers, The Search for Simplicity (1996), a text for a course in programming for non-majors, Programming for Everyone in Java (1999), a retrospective on the evolution of operating systems, Classic Operating Systems: From Batch Processing to Distributed Systems (2001), and a retrospective on the evolution of concurrent programming, The Origin of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls (2002). He self-published a 2004 memoir, A Programmer's Story: The Life of a Computer Pioneer, on his website. In 2002, Brinch Hansen was awarded the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award \\"For pioneering development in operating systems and concurrent programming exemplified by work on the RC 4000 multiprogramming system, monitors, and Concurrent Pascal.\\" On July 31, 2007, Brinch Hansen died, shortly after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Personal life  Brinch Hansen met his wife Milena (n√©e Hrastar) on a class trip to Yugoslavia in 1962. They married in 1965 and had two children, daughter Mette and son Thomas.  Scientific contributions and impacts  In a career spanning five decades, Brinch Hansen made seminal contributions in the areas of operating systems, concurrent computing and parallel and distributed computing that were influential in shaping the development of those fields and advancing them from ad hoc techniques to systematic engineering disciplines. The impact of his work was amplified by his \\"relentless search for simplicity,\\" his insistence on clarity, writing and rewriting his papers many times before publishing them, becoming \\"one of the best explainers in the business,\\" and his commitment to testing concepts in working systems ‚Äì Brinch Hansen implemented and distributed working systems for new concepts he developed, noting: = Operating systems = The RC 4000 multiprogramming system introduced the now-standard concept of an operating system kernel and the separation of policy and mechanism in operating system design. Modern microkernel architectures trace their roots to the extensible nucleus architecture of the RC 4000. Improving microkernel performance was a major theme in operating system research for three decades after the RC 4000. Brinch Hansen's text, Operating System Principles, was the first comprehensive textbook on operating systems. Eventually published in six languages (English, Japanese, German, Czech, Polish and Serbo-Croatian), it remained in print for decades, and years after the RC 4000 system it described had become outdated. In 1990, nearly two decades after its initial publication, P.J. Plauger reviewed it, saying: In 2005, ACM members voted Operating System Principles a top 25 classic book, in a survey to choose out-of-print classic books to add to the ACM Digital Library. Operating System Principles ranked 15th in the survey, appearing on 8.8% of ballots. It is now available from the ACM Digital Library. Using Concurrent Pascal, Brinch Hansen demonstrated that it was feasible to fully implement operating systems in high level languages, and that doing so reduced the development effort by one to two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, entire operating systems could be published, and understood in their entirety. Brinch Hansen did precisely that in The Architecture of Concurrent Programs, leading Roy Maddux and Harlan Mills to declare: > Part two of the book is indeed remarkable. Here, an entire operating system > is visible, with every line of program open to scrutiny. There is no hidden > mystery, and after studying such extensive examples, the reader feels that > he could tackle similar jobs and that he could change the system at will. > Never before have we seen an operating system shown in such detail and in a > manner so amenable to modification. = Concurrent programming = Brinch Hansen and Hoare developed the monitor concept. Brinch Hansen published the first monitor notation, adopting the class concept of Simula 67, and invented a queueing mechanism. Hoare refined the rules of process resumption. Brinch Hansen created the first implementation of monitors, in Concurrent Pascal. More than a dozen additional monitor-based languages had been created by 1990: Simone, Modula, CSP/k, CCNPascal, PLY, Pascal Plus, Mesa, SB-Mod, Concurrent Euclid, Pascalc, Concurrent C, Emerald, Real-time Euclid, Pascal-FC, Turing Plus, Predula. Concurrent Pascal was the first concurrent programming language: the first language developed specifically for concurrent programming, and more importantly, the first language to demonstrate that it was possible to incorporate secure, high-level facilities for concurrency, where the system could guarantee that processes access disjoint sets of variables only and do not interfere with each other in time dependent ways. Hoare described it as \\"an outstanding example of the best of academic research in this area.\\" Source and portable code for Concurrent Pascal and the Solo operating system were distributed to at least 75 companies and 100 universities in 21 countries, resulting in its widespread adoption, porting and adaptation in both industry and academia. Greg Andrews observed that Concurrent Pascal and monitors \\"greatly influenced most subsequent concurrent language proposals.\\" Brinch Hansen's The Architecture of Concurrent Programs was the first book on concurrent programming, and was eventually published in three languages (English, Japanese, and German). More than a dozen years after its publication, P. J. Plauger observed: > Sure, improvements have been made in the past dozen years. We have better > synchronization algorithms and fancier (if not necessarily better) languages > with concurrency control. But you won't find a better overview of concurrent > programming than this book. At least I haven't found one. In 2005, ACM members voted The Architecture of Concurrent Programs a top 25 classic book, ranking it 18th in the survey, and appearing on 8% of ballots. It is now available from the ACM Digital Library. = Distributed computing and remote procedure call = Remote procedure calls used in modern operating systems trace their roots back to the RC 4000 multiprogramming system, which used a request-response communication protocol for process synchronization. In his 1978 paper on distributed processes, Brinch Hansen proposed a language for distributed computing based on external requests consisting of procedure calls between processes. This later became known in an operating system context as the remote procedure call. Later, Brinch Hansen developed two languages extending Hoare's CSP message-passing paradigm with parallel recursion, and showed how to efficiently implement such.

The first car, the 8 hp, produced in 1912 was powered by an air-cooled JAP V-twin engine, three-speed gearbox and chain drive. Unlike many cyclecars a differential was fitted to the rear axle. The two-seater bodywork was in aluminium with a wheelbase of 96 inches (2440 mm) and the range included a van. Springing was half-elliptic springs front and rear and braking was by external bands on the rear wheels. The car cost about ¬£100 and was claimed to be capable of 50 mph (80 km/h). It was exhibited at the 1912 London Motor Cycle show. In 1913 the engine was replaced by a water-cooled Precision, V twin of 964 cc. There were other improvements including changing the brakes to internal expanding and replacing the chain with shaft drive. The price rose to ¬£135. Just before the outbreak of war, in mid-1914, came the final Tiny called the 10/15. This one was a proper light car and had a four-cylinder Dorman engine of 1177 cc. It cost ¬£157. It is uncertain how many Tinys were made but output was small. After the First World War, the same company produced cars under Airedale brand.

When sauerkraut is used instead, the soup is called sour shchi, while soups based on sorrel, spinach, nettle, and similar plants are called green shchi (, zelyoniye shchi). In the past, the term sour shchi was also used to refer to a drink, a variation of kvass, which was unrelated to the soup. History Shchi is a traditional soup of Russia where it has been known as far back as the 9th century, soon after cabbage was introduced from Byzantium. Its popularity in Russia originates from several factors. Shchi is relatively easy to prepare; it can be cooked with or without various types of meat; and it can be frozen and carried as a solid on a trip to be cut up when needed. As a result, by the 10th century shchi became a staple food of Russia, and a popular saying sprang from this fact: \\"–©–∏ –¥–∞ –∫–∞—à–∞ ‚Äî –ø–∏—â–∞ –Ω–∞—à–∞.\\" (Shchi da kasha ‚Äî pishcha nasha \\"Shchi and kasha are our food\\"). The major components of shchi were originally cabbage, meat (beef, pork, lamb, or poultry), mushrooms, flour, and spices (based on onion and garlic). Cabbage and meat were cooked separately and smetana was added as a garnish before serving. Shchi is traditionally eaten with rye bread. The ingredients of shchi gradually changed. Flour, which was added in early times to increase the soup's caloric value, was excluded for the sake of finer taste. The spice mixture was enriched with black pepper and bay leaf, which were imported to Russia around the 15th century, also from Byzantium. Meat was sometimes substituted with fish, while carrot and parsley could be added to the vegetables. Beef was the most popular meat for shchi in Russia, while pork was more common in Ukraine. The water-to-cabbage ratio varied and whereas early shchi was often so viscous that a spoon could stand in it, more diluted preparation was adopted later. Linguistics The two-letter word —â–∏ contains the letter —â, which is absent in most non-Cyrillic alphabets and is transcribed into them with several letters. In German, —â–∏ becomes eight letters, Schtschi.

It is named after the French mathematician Augustin Louis Cauchy. Definitions The Cauchy product may apply to infinite series........... or power series... When people apply it to finite sequences. or finite series, it is by abuse of language: they actually refer to discrete convolution. Convergence issues are discussed in the next section. =Cauchy product of two infinite series= Let \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty a_i and \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty b_j be two infinite series with complex terms. The Cauchy product of these two infinite series is defined by a discrete convolution as follows: :\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty a_i\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty b_j\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty c_k where c_k=\\\\sum_{l=0}^k a_l b_{k-l}. =Cauchy product of two power series= Consider the following two power series :\\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty a_i x^i and \\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty b_j x^j with complex coefficients \\\\\\\\{a_i\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{b_j\\\\\\\\}. The Cauchy product of these two power series is defined by a discrete convolution as follows: :\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty a_i x^i\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty b_j x^j\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty c_k x^k where c_k=\\\\sum_{l=0}^k a_l b_{k-l}. Convergence and Mertens' theorem Let and be real or complex sequences. It was proved by Franz Mertens that, if the series \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n converges to and \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty b_n converges to , and at least one of them converges absolutely, then their Cauchy product converges to . It is not sufficient for both series to be convergent; if both sequences are conditionally convergent, the Cauchy product does not have to converge towards the product of the two series, as the following example shows: =Example= Consider the two alternating series with :a_n = b_n = \\\\frac{(-1)^n}{\\\\sqrt{n+1}}\\\\,, which are only conditionally convergent (the divergence of the series of the absolute values follows from the direct comparison test and the divergence of the harmonic series). The terms of their Cauchy product are given by :c_n = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\frac{(-1)^k}{\\\\sqrt{k+1}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{ (-1)^{n-k} }{ \\\\sqrt{n-k+1} } = (-1)^n \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\sqrt{(k+1)(n-k+1)} } for every integer . Since for every we have the inequalities and , it follows for the square root in the denominator that , hence, because there are summands, :c_n \\\\ge \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\frac{1}{n+1} = 1 for every integer . Therefore, does not converge to zero as , hence the series of the diverges by the term test. =Proof of Mertens' theorem= Assume without loss of generality that the series \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n converges absolutely. Define the partial sums :A_n = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i,\\\\quad B_n = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n b_i\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad C_n = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n c_i with :c_i=\\\\sum_{k=0}^ia_kb_{i-k}\\\\,. Then :C_n = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n a_{n-i}B_i by rearrangement, hence Fix . Since \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{k\\\\in{\\\\mathbb N}} a_k<\\\\infty by absolute convergence, and since converges to as , there exists an integer such that, for all integers , (this is the only place where the absolute convergence is used). Since the series of the converges, the individual must converge to 0 by the term test. Hence there exists an integer such that, for all integers , Also, since converges to as , there exists an integer such that, for all integers , Then, for all integers , use the representation () for , split the sum in two parts, use the triangle inequality for the absolute value, and finally use the three estimates (), () and () to show that :\\\\begin{align} C_n - AB &= \\\\biggl\\\\sum_{i=0}^n a_{n-i}(B_i-B)+(A_n-A)B\\\\biggr \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\le \\\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\\\underbrace{a_{\\\\underbrace{\\\\scriptstyle n-i}_{\\\\scriptscriptstyle \\\\ge M}}\\\\,B_i-B}_{\\\\le\\\\,\\\\varepsilon/(3N)\\\\text{ by (3)}}+{}\\\\underbrace{\\\\sum_{i=N}^n a_{n-i}\\\\,B_i-B}_{\\\\le\\\\,\\\\varepsilon/3\\\\text{ by (2)}}+{}\\\\underbrace{A_n-A\\\\,B}_{\\\\le\\\\,\\\\varepsilon/3\\\\text{ by (4)}}\\\\le\\\\varepsilon\\\\,. \\\\end{align} By the definition of convergence of a series, as required. Ces√†ro's theorem In cases where the two sequences are convergent but not absolutely convergent, the Cauchy product is still Ces√†ro summable. Specifically: If \\\\textstyle (a_n)_{n\\\\geq0}, \\\\textstyle (b_n)_{n\\\\geq0} are real sequences with \\\\textstyle \\\\sum a_n\\\\to A and \\\\textstyle \\\\sum b_n\\\\to B then : \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{n=1}^N\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{k=0}^i a_k b_{i-k}\\\\right)\\\\to AB. This can be generalised to the case where the two sequences are not convergent but just Ces√†ro summable: =Theorem= For \\\\textstyle r>-1 and \\\\textstyle s>-1, suppose the sequence \\\\textstyle (a_n)_{n\\\\geq0} is \\\\textstyle (C,\\\\; r) summable with sum A and \\\\textstyle (b_n)_{n\\\\geq0} is \\\\textstyle (C,\\\\; s) summable with sum B. Then their Cauchy product is \\\\textstyle (C,\\\\; r+s+1) summable with sum AB. Examples * For some \\\\textstyle x,y\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}, let \\\\textstyle a_n = x^n/n! and \\\\textstyle b_n = y^n/n!. Then :: c_n = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n\\\\frac{x^i}{i!}\\\\frac{y^{n-i}}{(n-i)!} = \\\\frac{1}{n!}\\\\sum_{i=0}^n\\\\binom{n}{i}x^i y^{n-i} = \\\\frac{(x+y)^n}{n!} : by definition and the binomial formula. Since, formally, \\\\textstyle \\\\exp(x) = \\\\sum a_n and \\\\textstyle \\\\exp(y) = \\\\sum b_n, we have shown that \\\\textstyle \\\\exp(x+y) = \\\\sum c_n. Since the limit of the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series is equal to the product of the limits of those series, we have proven the formula \\\\textstyle \\\\exp(x+y) = \\\\exp(x)\\\\exp(y) for all \\\\textstyle x,y\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. * As a second example, let \\\\textstyle a_n=b_n = 1 for all \\\\textstyle n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}. Then \\\\textstyle c_n = n+1 for all n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} so the Cauchy product \\\\textstyle \\\\sum c_n = (1,1+2,1+2+3,1+2+3+4,\\\\dots) does not converge. Generalizations All of the foregoing applies to sequences in \\\\textstyle \\\\mathbb{C} (complex numbers). The Cauchy product can be defined for series in the \\\\textstyle \\\\mathbb{R}^n spaces (Euclidean spaces) where multiplication is the inner product. In this case, we have the result that if two series converge absolutely then their Cauchy product converges absolutely to the inner product of the limits. = Products of finitely many infinite series = Let n \\\\in \\\\mathbb N such that n \\\\ge 2 (actually the following is also true for n=1 but the statement becomes trivial in that case) and let \\\\sum_{k_1 = 0}^\\\\infty a_{1, k_1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\sum_{k_n = 0}^\\\\infty a_{n, k_n} be infinite series with complex coefficients, from which all except the nth one converge absolutely, and the nth one converges. Then the series :\\\\sum_{k_1 = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k_2 = 0}^{k_1} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{k_n = 0}^{k_{n-1}} a_{1, k_n} a_{2, k_{n-1} - k_n} \\\\cdots a_{n, k_1 - k_2} converges and we have: :\\\\sum_{k_1 = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k_2 = 0}^{k_1} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{k_n = 0}^{k_{n-1}} a_{1, k_n} a_{2, k_{n-1} - k_n} \\\\cdots a_{n, k_1 - k_2} = \\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\left( \\\\sum_{k_j = 0}^\\\\infty a_{j, k_j} \\\\right) This statement can be proven by induction over n: The case for n = 2 is identical to the claim about the Cauchy product. This is our induction base. The induction step goes as follows: Let the claim be true for an n \\\\in \\\\mathbb N such that n \\\\ge 2, and let \\\\sum_{k_1 = 0}^\\\\infty a_{1, k_1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\sum_{k_{n+1} = 0}^\\\\infty a_{n+1, k_{n+1}} be infinite series with complex coefficients, from which all except the n+1th one converge absolutely, and the n+1th one converges. We first apply the induction hypothesis to the series \\\\sum_{k_1 = 0}^\\\\infty a_{1, k_1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\sum_{k_n = 0}^\\\\infty a_{n, k_n}. We obtain that the series :\\\\sum_{k_1 = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k_2 = 0}^{k_1} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{k_n = 0}^{k_{n-1}} a_{1, k_n} a_{2, k_{n-1} - k_n} \\\\cdots a_{n, k_1 - k_2} converges, and hence, by the triangle inequality and the sandwich criterion, the series :\\\\sum_{k_1 = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\left \\\\sum_{k_2 = 0}^{k_1} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{k_n = 0}^{k_{n-1}} a_{1, k_n} a_{2, k_{n-1} - k_n} \\\\cdots a_{n, k_1 - k_2} \\\\right converges, and hence the series :\\\\sum_{k_1 = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k_2 = 0}^{k_1} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{k_n = 0}^{k_{n-1}} a_{1, k_n} a_{2, k_{n-1} - k_n} \\\\cdots a_{n, k_1 - k_2} converges absolutely.

Relation to convolution of functions  A finite sequence can be viewed as an infinite sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms, or in other words as a function f: \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} with finite support. For any complex-valued functions f, g on \\\\mathbb{N} with finite support, one can take their convolution: :(f * g)(n) = \\\\sum_{i + j = n} f(i) g(j). Then \\\\sum (f *g)(n) is the same thing as the Cauchy product of \\\\sum f(n) and \\\\sum g(n). More generally, given a unital semigroup S, one can form the semigroup algebra \\\\mathbb{C}[S] of S, with the multiplication given by convolution. If one takes, for example, S = \\\\mathbb{N}^d, then the multiplication on \\\\mathbb{C}[S] is a generalization of the Cauchy product to higher dimension.

The villa‚Äôs correct name is Villa Almerico Capra Valmarana, but it is also known as \\"La Rotonda\\", \\"Villa Rotonda\\", \\"Villa Capra\\", and \\"Villa Almerico Capra\\". The name Capra derives from the Capra brothers, who completed the building after it was ceded to them in 1592. Along with other works by Palladio, the building is conserved as part of the World Heritage Site \\"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\\". Inspiration In 1565 a priest, Paolo Almerico, on his retirement from the Vatican (as referendario apostolico of Pope Pius IV and afterwards Pius V), decided to return to his home town of Vicenza in the Venetian countryside and build a country house. This house, later known as 'La Rotonda', was to be one of Palladio's best-known legacies to the architectural world. Villa Capra may have inspired a thousand subsequent buildings, but the villa was itself inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. Design The site selected was a hilltop just outside the city of Vicenza. Unlike some other Palladian villas of the Veneto, the building was not designed from the start to accommodate a working farm. This sophisticated building was designed for a site which was, in modern terminology, \\"suburban\\". Palladio classed the building as a \\"palazzo\\" rather than a villa. Palladio's plan of Villa La Rotonda in I quattro libri dell'architettura, 1570 The design is for a completely symmetrical building having a square plan with four facades, each of which has a projecting portico. The whole is contained within an imaginary circle which touches each corner of the building and centres of the porticos. (illustration, left). The name La Rotonda refers to the central circular hall with its dome. To describe the villa, as a whole, as a rotunda is technically incorrect, as the building is not circular but rather the intersection of a square with a cross. Each portico has steps leading up to it, and opens via a small cabinet or corridor to the circular domed central hall. This and all other rooms were proportioned with mathematical precision according to Palladio's own rules of architecture which he published in I quattro libri dell'architettura.A. Palladio, I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura, Venezia (Venice) 1570, libro (book) II, p. 18 Works spaces for the villa's servants are hidden in a low level underneath the first floor, which is accessed via staircases hidden inside the walls of the central hall.HKW, Communal Villa, Lecture, 2015. 31 minute mark. https://www.hkw.de/en/app/mediathek/video/47405 The design reflected the humanist values of Renaissance architecture. In order for each room to have some sun, the design was rotated 45 degrees from each cardinal point of the compass. Each of the four porticos has pediments graced by statues of classical deities. The pediments were each supported by six Ionic columns. Each portico was flanked by a single window. All principal rooms were on the second floor or piano nobile. Building began in 1567. Neither Palladio nor the owner, Paolo Almerico, were to see the completion of the villa. Palladio died in 1580 and a second architect, Vincenzo Scamozzi, was employed by the new owners to oversee the completion. One of the major changes he made to the original plan was to modify the two-storey central hall. Interior of the rotonda Palladio had intended it to be covered by a high semi-circular dome but Scamozzi designed a lower dome with an oculus (intended to be open to the sky) inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The dome was ultimately completed with a cupola. Interior The interior design of the Villa was to be as wonderful, if not more so, than the exterior. Alessandro and Giovanni Battista Maganza and Anselmo Canera were commissioned to paint frescoes in the principal salons. Among the four principal salons on the piano nobile are the West Salon (also called the Holy Room, because of the religious nature of its frescoes and ceiling), and the East Salon, which contains an allegorical life story of the first owner, Paolo Almerico, his many admirable qualities portrayed in fresco. The highlight of the interior is the central, circular hall, surrounded by a balcony and covered by the domed ceiling; it soars the full height of the main house up to the cupola, with walls decorated in trompe l'oeil. Abundant frescoes create an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of a cathedral than the principal salon of a country house. Landscape From the porticos, views of the surrounding countryside can be seen; this is no coincidence as the Villa was designed to be in perfect harmony with the landscape. This was in complete contrast to such buildings as Villa Farnese of just 16 years earlier. Thus, while the house appears to be completely symmetrical, it actually has certain deviations, designed to allow each facade to complement the surrounding landscape and topography. Hence, there are variations in the facades, in the width of steps, retaining walls, etc. In this way, the symmetry of the architecture allows for the asymmetry of the landscape, and creates a seemingly symmetrical whole. The landscape is a panoramic vision of trees and meadows and woods, with Vicenza on the horizon. The northwest portico is set onto the hill as the termination of a straight carriage drive from the principal gates. This carriageway is an avenue between the service blocks, built by the Capra brothers, who acquired the Villa in 1591; they commissioned Vincenzo Scamozzi to complete the villa and construct the range of staff and agricultural buildings. Current conditions In 1994 UNESCO designated the building as part of a World Heritage Site.In 1996 the World Heritage Site \\"Vicenza, City of Palladio\\" was extended and renamed \\"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\\". The last owner of the villa was Mario di Valmarana (‚Ä† Oct. 13, 2010), a former professor of architecture at the University of Virginia. It was his declared ambition to preserve Villa Rotonda so that it may be appreciated by future generations. The interior is open to the public on Wednesdays and Saturdays, except during the winter months, and the grounds are open every day. Film In 1979 the American film director Joseph Losey filmed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera Don Giovanni in Villa La Rotonda and the Veneto region of Italy. the film was nominated for several C√©sar Awards in 1980 including Best Director, and has generally been praised as one of the finer cinematic adaptations of opera.

C-41, also known as CN-16 by Fuji, CNK-4 by Konica, and AP-70 by AGFA, is the most popular film process in use, with most photofinishing labs devoting at least one machine to this development process. Processed C-41 negatives, as with all color films, consist of an image formed of dye. Due to the long-term instability of dyes, C-41 negatives can fade or color-shift over time. This was a significant problem with early films; whether the newer films are archival or not is a subject of some debate. Film layers FujiColor Superia is an example of a C-41 process film. This diagram illustrates the layers FujiFilm has chosen for this film. Note the antihalation layer. C-41 film consists of an acetate or polyester film base, onto which multiple emulsions are coated. Each layer is only sensitive to a certain color of visible light. In the classic illustrative example, there are three emulsions: one is red sensitive, another is green sensitive, and the top is blue-sensitive. Beneath the blue layer is a yellow filter, composed of dyes or colloidal silver. All silver-based photographic emulsions have some sensitivity to blue light, regardless of what other colors they may be sensitized for. This filter layer serves to remove the blue light, which would expose the layers beneath it. Beneath the blue- sensitive layer and the yellow filter are the green and red sensitive layers. The illustrative example outlined above differs from the design of actual film, in respect to the number of layers. Almost all C-41 films contain multiple layers sensitive to each color. Each of these layers has different speed and contrast characteristics, allowing the film to be correctly exposed over a wider range of lighting conditions. In addition to multiple emulsion layers, real films have other layers that are not sensitive to light. Some films are top-coated with UV blocking layers or anti-scratch coatings. There also may be layers to space different emulsions, or additional filter layers. Each emulsion layer, in addition to the light-sensitive components, contains chemicals called dye couplers. These couplers, located in the blue, green and red-sensitive layers, produce yellow, magenta and cyan dyes, respectively, when developed. Process The C-41 process is the same for all C-41 films, although different manufacturers' processing chemistries vary slightly. After exposure, the film is developed in a \\"color developer\\". The developing ingredient is a paraphenylene diamine-based chemical known as CD-4. The developer develops the silver in the emulsion layers. As the silver is developing, oxidized developer reacts with the dye couplers, resulting in formation of dyes. The control of temperature and agitation of the film in the developer is critical in obtaining consistent, accurate results. Incorrect temperature can result in severe color shifts or significant under- or overdevelopment of the film. After the developer, a bleach converts the metallic silver generated by development to silver halide, which is soluble in fixer. After the bleach, a fixer removes the silver halide. This is followed by a wash, and a final stabilizer and rinse to complete the process. There are simplified versions of the process that use a combined bleach-fix (EDTA) that dissolves the silver generated by development and removes undeveloped silver halide. These are not used by commercial C-41 processors, and are marketed for home or field use. Push processing Like the black-and-white film process, the C-41 process can be used to push-process films. Due to the complexity of the film and exacting nature of the process, the results vary widely; as with black-and-white negatives, the process generally results in a negative that is higher in contrast and sometimes higher in grain. The negative The resulting film is a negative, meaning that the darkest spots on the film are those areas that were brightest in the source. Nearly all C-41 films also include an additional orange mask to offset the optical inadequacies of the dyes in the film. These C-41 negatives appear orange when viewed directly, though the orange base is compensated for in the formulation of color print materials. Some C-41 films, intended for scanning, do not have this orange base. The finished negative is printed using color photographic paper to yield a positive image. Black-and-white use =C-41 \\"chromogenic\\" black-and- white films= While C-41 is usually considered a color process, Ilford manufacture two \\"chromogenic\\" C-41 compatible black-and-white films, their own XP2 Super and Fuji's Neopan 400CN. Kodak used to manufacture a similar film, BW400CN, but this was discontinued in August 2014. (These should not be confused with regular black-and-white films, which are not compatible with C-41 chemistry.) These films work like any other C-41 film; development causes dyes to form in the emulsion. Their structure, however, is different. Although they may have multiple layers, all are sensitive to all colors of light, and are designed to produce a black dye. The result is a black-and white image. The Kodak film has the same orange base as color C-41 films; the base on XP2 is Purple and Fuji films are clear. The orange base on the Kodak film allows them to be printed with correct blacks on standard color printing machines, but this film can be difficult to print on multigrade black-and-white paper, whose contrast is determined by the use of a colored filter during the printing process. Conversely, the clear-based Ilford and Fuji films sometimes results in off-color prints on color paper, but can be optically printed on black-and-white paper, just like any other black-and-white film. It is often said that prints from these films do not have grain. While they may not appear to have grain, this statement is technically incorrect. On an image from regular black-and-white film, the individual silver particles forming the image are seen as grain. The image on the C-41 films, however, does not contain silver. Instead, C-41 negatives and prints have clouds of dye, causing the resulting image to appear different from that of silver grain. =Traditional black-and-white films = While regular black-and-white films are not intended for use with C-41 chemistry, some photographers have used C-41 developer to develop high-contrast black-and-white films (such as traffic surveillance film and Kodak's Technical Pan). This is done in order to lower the contrast. In this application, only a silver image is formed; the bleach step of the C-41 process is not used, as it would destroy the image. Cross processing It is also possible to cross-process slide film for the E-6 process in C-41, which yields negatives with a color shift and stronger saturation. (C-41 film also may be processed in E-6 yielding positive images with a strong green cast, caused by the orange mask.) Varying brands and film speeds yield different color shifts producing bright, saturated colors and high contrast. C-41 film can be processed in standard black-and-white chemicals, to produce a monochrome negative image. The negatives will typically be of very low contrast, and cloudy, partly caused by the orange mask.

Moosewood is located on the first floor of the Dewitt Mall building, which is a converted high school. When The Seed Company (a bookstore cafe) closed, the owners gave Therese Tischler the money they had left saying, \\"We're giving this ($1200) to you because we know you'll find something good to do with it.\\" Therese had been politically active as a student at Cornell and was very concerned with ecology and the health of people and the planet. The work of Frances Moore Lapp√© and Adelle Davis formed part of her inspiration. She wanted to open a vegetarian restaurant and went to Judy Barringer and Kris Miller with the idea. About a year later Moosewood opened its doors. It won a James Beard Foundation \\"American Classic\\" Award in 2000. While they are most known for vegetarian cuisine, their menu does occasionally feature a seafood option. Cookbooks The restaurant is owned by Moosewood, Inc. a collective group of 19 owners which operates the restaurant and writes and publishes cookbooks as The Moosewood Collective. The Collective has produced 13 cookbooks over the years, beginning with New Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant, and its three most recent Moosewood Restaurant Favorites, published in 2013 by St. Martin's Press in celebration of the Moosewood Restaurant's fortieth year of continuous operation, Simple Suppers from Moosewood Restaurant, and Moosewood Restaurant Cooking for Health, in 2009. In 2010, the Moosewood Collective donated its archive of original cookbook manuscripts and memorabilia to Cornell University where they are housed in the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections in the Carl A.

It is fundamental in theoretical physics. In a physical theory having Minkowski space as the underlying spacetime, the space of physical states is typically a representation of the Poincar√© group. (More generally, it may be a projective representation, which amounts to a representation of the double cover of the group.) In a classical field theory, the physical states are sections of a Poincar√©-equivariant vector bundle over Minkowski space. The equivariance condition means that the group acts on the total space of the vector bundle, and the projection to Minkowski space is an equivariant map. Therefore, the Poincar√© group also acts on the space of sections. Representations arising in this way (and their subquotients) are called covariant field representations, and are not usually unitary. For a discussion of such unitary representations, see Wigner's classification. In quantum mechanics, the state of the system is determined by the Schr√∂dinger equation, which is invariant under Galilean transformations. Quantum field theory is the relativistic extension of quantum mechanics, where relativistic (Lorentz/Poincar√© invariant) wave equations are solved, \\"quantized\\", and act on a Hilbert space composed of Fock states; eigenstates of the theory's Hamiltonian which are states with a definite number of particles with individual 4-momentum. There are no finite unitary representations of the full Lorentz (and thus Poincar√©) transformations due to the non-compact nature of Lorentz boosts (rotations in Minkowski space along a space and time axis). However, there are finite non-unitary indecomposible representations of the Poincar√© algebra, which may be used for modelling of unstable particles. In case of spin 1/2 particles, it is possible to find a construction that includes both a finite-dimensional representation and a scalar product preserved by this representation by associating a 4-component Dirac spinor \\\\psi with each particle. These spinors transform under Lorentz transformations generated by the gamma matrices (\\\\gamma_{\\\\mu}). It can be shown that the scalar product :\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\phi\\\\rangle = \\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\phi = \\\\psi^{\\\\dagger}\\\\gamma_0\\\\phi is preserved. It is not, however, positive definite, so the representation is not unitary. References  * *.

Description Kensington Security Slot on this portable hard disk drive is marked with a small padlock symbol The system consists of a small, metal- reinforced hole found commonly on small or portable computers and electronics equipment such as laptops, computer monitors, desktop computers, gaming consoles, and video projectors, combined with a metal anchor attached to a rubberized metal cable secured with a key or combination lock. The end of the cable has a small loop that allows the cable to be looped around a permanent object, such as a heavy table or other similar equipment. The hole is found in most laptops, although a lock for it is typically not included. Occasionally, the slot is located so that installing a lock will also prevent the removal of a valuable subcomponent, such as a rechargeable battery or a memory module. The Kensington slot may be marked with a small icon that looks like a padlock with a capital \\"K\\", or the slot may be unlabelled.  Security  A security cable attached to a Kensington Security Slot on the side of a laptop Kensington locks are not designed to be an impervious protection measure. Because most computer equipment cases are generally made of plastic or thin metal, the lock can be torn out, though not without doing significant visible damage to the case. The cable itself can be cut if an individual has a wire cutter or bolt cutter sufficiently strong to cut through the cable material, which will vary between different brands of cable. The Kensington type locks are useful to discourage quick grab-and-run thefts of equipment from casually supervised locations such as coffee shops, but cannot prevent the removal of equipment secured in an unattended location. The key is often a cylindrical type, but there are versions which use a traditional flat key. There are also versions of the lock that use a numeric combination instead of a key.  Alternatives  Several manufacturers offer similar locking mechanisms that do not require a special lock hole. They attach to a popular port, such as the VGA or printer port, and have special screws to secure locks in place.

The newspaper began in 1879. According to a 1993 article by Dr. William Lawbaugh in The Mountain Briefing, the first issues were printed on a hand-operated press by Professor Ernest Lagarde from his home. Early issues of the newspaper were four pages long and reported on education, sports, and significant campus events. The issues also included articles on the history of Mount St. Mary's, poetry and literary works, death notices, alumni news, and personal and other advertisements. The Mountain Echo ceased publication after several years, but was revived on October 28, 1923, when Volume I, Number 1 was published. The Echo has been in continuous publication since then. The Mountain Echo was restructured during the academic year 1974-75, and was renamed The Mountain Review. The name was changed back to The Mountain Echo the following year. By the 1995/96 academic year, The Mountain Echo was printing a 24-page issue on a biweekly schedule. That year the newspaper expanded into two other formats. Echo Online was the first incarnation of The Mountain Echo website. And Echo Weekly News with Vince Chesney was a radio show hosted by the newspaper's editor-in-chief on the college radio station, WMTB. =Tolle Lege= Tolle Lege, first published in 2007, is a collection of philosophy and theology essays by undergraduates and seminarians.

Lighted Corners is dedicated to art, fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, and photography. Each year near the end of the fall semester, submissions are collected through email, which are voted on anonymously by staff. The editorial board makes the final selections, and then the staff spends the spring semester editing and putting the magazine together. Lighted Corners has won many awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association (CSPA), the American Scholastic Press Association, and the Society for Collegiate Journalists. In 2017, Lighted Corners received a Gold Medal and All-Columbian honors from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association.

Punaluu Beach (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between PƒÅhala and NƒÅƒÅlehu on the Big Island of the U.S. state of Hawaii. The beach has black sand made of basalt and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Punaluu is frequented by endangered hawksbill and green turtles, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. The Beach Close-up of black sand The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim. The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the ancient Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. In the Hawaiian language puna luu means \\"spring [water] diver for\\". The beach is located at coordinates . Access is from the Hawaii Belt Road: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to the Sea Mountain Resort. Camping is permitted at the Punaluu Black Sand Beach Park. Wahi Pana O Punaluu A green turtle basking on the beach Children and honu share the black-sand beach at Punaluu The Henry Opukahaia Chapel Punaluu and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time. Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of the alii (ruling class) and the social stratification of the ancient Ka≈´ district. With the advent of missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka≈´. Sitting on the ridge above Punaluu is the H≈çk≈´loa Church, a Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of Henry ≈åp≈´kahaia (1792‚Äì1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii. There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punaluu. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punaluuu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next. To the south lies Kaiei.e. Heiau. Thought to be a fishing shrine, the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east‚Äîhome of the legendary na iliili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water- polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane. The name Kaiei.e. is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous ieie vine. Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Kaiei.e. today. Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional. It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location. The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course. Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an ‚Äúisland‚Äù swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens. The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punaluu Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kaneeleele; Mailekini or Punaluu Nui. This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punaluu Bay. Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf‚Äìwarehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906. Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone). Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists). Another important cultural feature is Ala Kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Kau coast to Puna. This trail once paved with the na iliili hanau was designated as a National Historic Trail in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punaluu Nui and Kaiei.e. heiau. Kii pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these ‚Äúunmarked‚Äù ancient carvings. Endangered species A honu resting on Punaluu Rare and endangered native animals known at Punaluu and Ninole are the honu ea (hawksbill turtle), honu (green turtle), Hawaiian monk seal, native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other anchialine pool fauna. Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered Hawaiian hawk (io) that nests in the trees at Punaluu. Spinner dolphins and humpback whales can also be sighted offshore from Punaluu. Residents say such sightings are common. A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punaluu in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered hawksbill turtles are located along the Punaluu and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals. The hawksbill turtle or honu'ea (Eretmochelys imbricata), is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean. Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting hawksbill turtles in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawaii. More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawaii Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna. The threatened green turtle or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline such as Punaluu. Red seaweed, a favorite food of the green turtle flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers. Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the green turtle since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain from the turtles at all times. The endangered Hawaiian hoary bat, opeapea, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punaluu. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet. It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects. Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole. It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nƒ´nole Springs to the estuary at Honuapo. Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at KƒÅwƒÅa, Hƒ´lea, Nƒ´nole, and Honuapo. The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marsh, at the mouth of Hƒ´lea and Nƒ´nole Streams, and at KƒÅwƒÅa Springs. Vegetation The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pƒÅhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and aƒÅ flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities. In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth). Native plants such as ilima (Sida fallax), naupaka kahakai (Scaevola taccada), and p≈çhuehue (Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis) were found in the area. Wetlands The wetlands adjacent to Punaluu Beach The second largest spring complex on Hawaii Island is located at Punaluu and Ninole Cove. Stretching from Punaluu to Nƒ´nole Springs through KƒÅwƒÅa to Honupo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna. These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island. Anchialine pools Anchialine pools of various types occur near and around Punaluu and Ninole Cove. These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea. They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves. Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks. The orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation. Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts. Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii‚Äôs most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals. In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, non-native fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species. Koa Punaluu has long been known for its koa (‚Äúfish houses‚Äù) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore. The pristine, spring fed waters of Punaluu mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punaluu still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including yellowfin tuna (ahi) and mackerel (ono, or wahoo). Historically, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked taro and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein. Development A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by C. Brewer & Co. from 1969 to 1972. A larger resort was proposed in 1986. After opposition, the plans were scaled back. The project was partially built but abandoned. In 2005, further development called \\"Sea Mountain\\" of about and up to 2000 residential units was proposed by a company based in Beverly Hills, California. An environmental impact statement was developed in 2006. Despite the involvement of Jean-Michel Cousteau, this development met local opposition. Popular culture In the 1960s, Japanese actor and guitarist Y≈´z≈ç Kayama composed a surf rock tune called \\"Black Sand Beach\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXKXUYcrd5w This song has since been played by Y≈´z≈ç Kayama & Launchers, Takeshi Terauchi & Blue Jeans, The Ventures, & The Aquatudes.

Since its inception the band's music has been inspired by medieval texts and fantasy. History Ange was initially influenced by Procol Harum and King Crimson, and its music was quite theatrical and poetic. Its first success in France was the cover of a Jacques Brel song, Ces gens-l√†, on its second album Le Cimeti√®re des Arlequins. The band provided its first concert on January 30, 1970, at the cultural center \\"La P√©pini√®re\\", in Belfort, France. It performed 110 concerts in England from 1973 to 1976, opening for Genesis at the Reading Festival in England, on August 26, 1973, fronting some 30.000 listeners. One of the reasons for which the band was unable to break through into the British market was because they sang in French. Ange eventually released an English-speaking version of its fifth album Par les fils de Mandrin (By the sons of Mandrin), which was hard to find and sold poorly, although this version has since been made available on CD. Unfortunately, after three albums, the quality of creation had started to decrease, and Par les fils de Mandrin was probably not a good choice to try to break into the British market. Au del√† du d√©lire, the third album, could be the band's best effort and is recommended as the one to listen to as a starter, for newcomers to the Ange progressive phenomenon. Following Par les fils de Mandrin and the excellent live double album Tome VI, the band issued a mellotron one, Guet-apens, and then had a more rock-oriented change of direction, although various progressive reformations occurred over the years, e.g. for the 1992 album Les larmes du Dala√Ø-Lama. Sponsored by the French radio RTL, Ange relentlessly toured till the end of 1977, welcoming an average of 5,000 to 6,000 listeners per show. During their first years (generally regarded as the best ones), the other three members of the band were Jean- Michel Br√©zovar on guitar and flute, G√©rard Jelsch on drums, and Daniel Haas on bass (and acoustic guitar). In 1995, Ange played its announced farewell tour. Christian D√©camps released a few albums as \\"Christian D√©camps et Fils\\" (\\"Christian D√©camps and Son\\"), before taking over the name \\"Ange\\" in 1999, and is backed by his band for his solo albums. The new lineup has issued several albums from La voiture √† eau in 1999, performed on 2006 edition of NEARfest and was still on the road in 2013. Francis D√©camps and Jean-Michel Br√©zovar have also released solo albums. Keyboards The keyboard sounds of the '70s-era band, while reminiscent of a mellotron, were in fact generated from a Viscount organ through a modded Hammond reverb. However, an actual mellotron was played on the album Par Les Fils De Mandrin in 1976.

Located in Dearborn, Michigan, the Museum seeks to show visitors the Arab American story through a timeline of exhibits while dispelling misconceptions about Arab Americans. The museum features three permanent exhibits. The first floor features the contributions of the Arab civilization such as science, medicine, mathematics, architecture, and the decorative arts. The second floor focuses on the Arab experience in America, including a gallery about prominent Arab- Americans such as Ralph Nader and Helen Thomas. Documents and artifacts from Arab Americans related to immigration and the immigration process are displayed, and stories of Arab Americans are portrayed in video or audio recordings. The AANM also includes two large gallery spaces for the exhibiting of art. The Museum's inaugural exhibition In/Visible featured a number of Arab American and Arab artists including Emily Jacir, John Halaka, Athir Shayota, Helen Zughaib, Rheim Alkadhi, Abdelali Dahrouch, Sumayyah Samaha, Mariam Ghani and Doris Bittar and was curated by Salwa Mikdadi.Farhat, Maymanah, \\"IN/VISIBLE Art Exhibition Inaugurates Arab American National Museum\\", Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, August 2005. Construction of the museum cost $15 million. Donors included Chrysler, General Motors, the Rockefeller Foundation, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.Harry Mount. Islam's US faithful are happy to embrace the American dream, Daily Telegraph, July 23, 2005. The museum is also a part of the Smithsonian Affiliations. In February 2019, the leader of ACCESS announced Diana Abouali as the new director to the Arab American National Museum.  Mission statement  The Arab American National Museum's mission is to document, preserve, celebrate, and educate the public on the history, life, culture and contributions of Arab Americans. The museum serves as a resource to enhance knowledge and understanding about Arab Americans and their presence in the United States.  Programs and events MOVE is a first-of-its-kind national gathering that provides a space for artists, activists, scholars, philanthropists, organizations and others from the Arab American community to connect, learn and exchange ideas. MOVE 2017, produced by ACCESS and its three national institutions ‚Äì the Arab American National Museum, the National Network for Arab American Communities (NNAAC) and the Center for Arab American Philanthropy (CAAP) ‚Äì will Mobilize, Organize, Vocalize, and Empower attendees as they explore intersectionality in a safe environment and have critical conversations about a wide range of issues impacting Arab Americans. DIWAN: A Forum for the Arts is now a part of MOVE. DIWAN unites Arab American artists, scholars and performers representing myriad academic fields and artistic genres for a weekend dialogue that reinforces the AANM's commitment to providing a place for community members and artists to meet, exchange ideas and exhibit their work. Notable presenters at the 2009 DIWAN conference include writer Najla Said, poet Suheir Hammad, artist Wafaa Bilal, and poet Remi Kanazi. Global Fridays is a periodic music program at the AANM that promotes World Music. Though Global Fridays is held at the Arab American National Museum the music is a diverse mix from Mexican American roots music to Chinese Classical and Rock. Arab Film Festival is an annual film festival put on by the AANM that showcases a number of Arab and Arab American films over a weekend. Past festivals have celebrated the career of a particular Arab filmmaker or director. The 2008 Arab Film Festival honored the work of Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine and showed his films The Cairo Station and The Destiny. The festival also features short films such as Kemo Sabe the story of Yussef, a six-year-old Arab-American boy who dreams of being the Cowboy instead of the Indian on the playground. The Arab American Book Award was established in 2006 to celebrate and support the research of and the written work of Arab Americans and their culture. The Arab American Book Award encourages the publication and excellence of books that preserve and advance the understanding, knowledge, and resources of the Arab American community by celebrating the thoughts and lives of Arab Americans. The purpose of the Award is to inspire authors, educate readers and foster a respect and understanding of the Arab American culture. Permanent art collection Complementing its regular lineup of solo and group exhibitions of art from the Arab world and its American diaspora, the museum holds a permanent collection of paintings, drawings, sculpture, photography, and installation art. Artists represented in this collection include Emily Jacir, Julienne Jabara Johnson, Mary Tuma, Sama Alshaibi, Hani Zurob, Helen Zughaib, John Halaka, Samia Halaby, Kamal Boullata, Doris Bittar, Sumayyah Samaha, Afaf Zurayk, Leila Kubba Kawash, Athir Shayota, Wafer Shayota, and Adnan Charara.

After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he became a soldier-of-fortune and mercenary and led the notorious Glanton Gang of scalp-hunters in the American South-West. Biography =Early life and education= Glanton (sometimes spelled \\"Gallantin\\"), was born in Edgefield County, South Carolina, in 1819. He was said to have been an outlaw in Tennessee, where his family had moved, before they went to Texas. He would have been under arms at an early age.\\"John Joel Glanton\\", Texas Handbook of History Online, accessed 2 Dec 2009 In 1835, at age sixteen, Glanton was living with his parents at Gonzales, Texas. Some accounts said he was engaged but his fianc√©e was killed that year by Lipan Apaches. =Military career= Glanton was involved in early military affairs in Texas and the South-West, participating in both the Texas Revolution and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. While a member of Walter P. Lane's San Antonio company of Texas Rangers in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, contemporary sources attribute to him the 1847 killing of a Mexican civilian in the city of Magdalena.Walter P. Lane.

Although Glanton protested he had done so when the civilian had refused to obey his commands as sentry to halt passage, other witnesses claimed it had been an act of murder. The event brought Walter P. Lane, then a major in the army, into conflict with General Zachary Taylor. As a result, Glanton was forced to flee the American army police who were sent to arrest him.\\"Id.\\" He later reenlisted in John Coffee Hays' second regiment of the First Texas Mounted Rifles, and saw action with Winfield Scott's army in central Mexico.Frederick Wilkins.

Eakin Press. =Glanton Gang= After the war in the summer of 1849, Glanton and a posse of followers were hired in a nominally mercenary operation by Mexican authorities, to track down and kill bands of Apaches in northern Mexico and what is now part of the American South-West. To earn more money, the Glanton Gang began murdering and scalping peaceful agricultural American Indians and Mexican citizens alike to claim under the bounty for scalps. The soldier and memoirist Samuel Chamberlain claimed to have been a member of the band. According to Chamberlain, Glanton's second-in-command was a Texian known as Judge Holden. The state of Chihuahua put a bounty on the heads of the gang, declaring them outlaws by December, 1849. Chihuahuan authorities drove the gang out to Sonora, where they also wore out their welcome and moved north into what is now Arizona. =Glanton Massacre= In Arizona, Glanton's men became partners in a ferry at the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River, a popular crossing for settlers and prospectors traveling to and from California during the California Gold Rush. The gang sometimes killed the Mexican and American passengers returning from the gold-fields to take their money and goods. They destroyed a boat and killed some Quechans who were operating a rival ferry down the river near Pilot Knob. At dawn on April 23, 1850, a band of Quechans led by Caballo en Pelo killed and scalped Glanton and most of his gang in retaliation and reclaimed the tribe's ferry monopoly.Braatz, Timothy.

With a friendly personality, Norwich Terriers are today mostly a companion dog breed. One of the smallest terriers, these dogs are generally healthy, but are relatively rare, due in part to their low litter size and the common need for caesarian sections. Their drop-eared variety is the Norfolk Terrier. Recognized as the \\"official breed of England\\" in 1932, Norwich Terriers have been delighting owners around the world as a hardworking, loyal companion dogs for nearly a century.  Description  A Norwich Terrier. =Appearance= These terriers are one of the smallest working terriers (; at the withers), with prick ears and a double coat, which come in red, tan, wheaten, black and tan, and grizzle. Norwich Terriers can enjoy a tail length ranging from 2 inches to an impressive 8 inches. The consistency and frequency of tail wagging by the Norwich Terrier serves as an indicator of happiness. Grizzle and Black and Tan Norwich Terriers =Temperament= These small but hardy dogs can be courageous, intelligent and affectionate. They can be assertive, but it is not typical for them to be aggressive, quarrelsome or shy. They are energetic and thrive on an active life. They are also quite hungry all the time and will eat anything edible. They are eager to please, but have definite minds of their own. They are sensitive to scolding, but 100% Terrier. They should not usually be kept outside or in a kennel setting, because they enjoy the companionship of their owners. Norwich are not given to unnecessary barking, but they will warn of a stranger approaching. Once they realize that there is no threat, they can become immediate friends. Norwich are generally good with children, and if introduced to other household pets as a puppy they generally co-habit peacefully, though caution should be observed around rodent pets as they may be mistaken for prey. Health US and UK breed surveys put the life expectancy of the Norwich Terrier at 13‚Äì13.5 years. While the Norwich Terrier is considered a healthy breed, there are some health issues for which responsible breeders do preventive genetic health testing, thereby reducing the incidences. Norwich Terrier puppy The Norwich Terrier does have a predisposition for some health issues but studies to determine the exact mode of inheritance or the exact frequency in the breed are unknown or have not been conclusive. At present there are no disorders identified as \\"most important\\". Of secondary magnitude, cataracts are recognized as a disorder that has been reported sporadically and may be inherited. Also of a secondary magnitude there are instances of epilepsy, narrow tracheas, luxating patellas, hip dysplasia, mitral valve disease, portosystemic shunts, atopy(allergic inhalant dermatitis) and incorrect bites (how the teeth meet when the jaws are closed). Like all dogs, Norwich Terriers can have autoimmune reactivity to rabies vaccinations. Rabies-Vaccine-Induced Ischemic Dermatopathy, or RVI-ID, is a non-fatal but potentially serious reaction to chemicals called adjuvants in the vaccine. RVI-ID is often misdiagnosed, but if correctly diagnosed, is treatable. Symptoms may include: symmetrical dark spots or lesions at the tips of the ears; swelling, hard lumps or dark spots in the vicinity of the injection site. Higher volume Norwich breeders are seeing more dogs with breathing concerns, and the Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club (USA) has formed a new \\"Health and Genetics Sub-Committee for Research on Upper Airway Syndrome in Norwich Terriers\\".\\"The Norwich & Norfolk News,\\" Number 93, Fall 2006 Upper Airway Syndrome (UAS) covers all abnormalities that can occur in the upper airway, including: elongated soft palates; too short soft palates; narrow/misshapen tracheas; collapsing tracheas; stenotic nares (nasal passages that are too small); swollen tonsils; everted laryngeal saccules. These upper airway disorders can occur singly or in combination with one or two others. All compromise the airway and the dog's ability to breathe normally; the dog's breathing often sounds raspy or moist. It may be that shorter muzzles may have increased incidence of such issues. Norwich Terriers generally have small litters of 1 to 3 puppies. Generally, if a female is healthy, its optimal breeding period is between the ages of 2 (after all genetic health testing is complete - heart, eyes, hips and patellas) and six years. At seven years of age dogs are considered geriatric. The small supply and the high price of a purebred Norwich Terrier - often around US$4,500 in 2020 - has attracted fraud, as unsuspecting buyers pay full price for Cairn Terriers with docked tails, or mixed-breed puppies. In Canada and the United States, the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals maintains an open registry of dogs that have completed their genetic health testing program. Care =Exercise requirements= Norwich Terriers can be red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle (red and black hairs intermixed). Norwich Terriers are hardy, active dogs, bred for a working life of pursuing vermin and accompanying their farmer owners on horseback. A good daily walk is therefore the minimum needed to meet the exercise requirements of a healthy Norwich Terrier. Norwich Terriers compete in Earthdog competitions, and are increasingly common in Agility and Flyball competitions. The dogs were bred as working terriers, and thrive best with at least one hour of real activity daily, such as a good walk, run, or working session. Like any hard working dog, the Norwich Terrier loves to be rewarded with a hearty play session. Norwich Terriers show remarkable skills in fetching sticks, running long distances and even the occasional swim if supervised. Norwich Terriers are devoted to their owners and love companion sports. =Grooming= The Norwich Terrier has two coats - a harsh, wiry topcoat and a soft warm undercoat. Ideally, the coat is combed with a steel comb daily to once a week to remove the loose, dead hairs and prevent matting. Proper maintenance of the Norwich coat, like other hard wiry coats, requires \\"stripping,\\" or pulling the oldest hairs from the coat (using fingers and/or a \\"stripping knife,\\" a special grooming comb). Stripping results both in the coat retaining its proper appearance, and in the health of the dog's skin and coat. Ideally, owners hand-strip the coat on a regular basis to achieve what is called a \\"rolling\\" coat, where hairs of all lengths are growing in. Maintaining a rolling coat is easier on the dog's skin and requires shorter grooming sessions. At minimum, the coat should be stripped once in the autumn and once in the spring. Clipping or cutting negatively affects the appearance of the coat's natural colours and texture. =Tail docking= Only the American Kennel Club calls for a medium docked tail (long enough for a man's hand to grasp), though a natural tail is not a disqualification. In Canada most of Australia, tail docking is optional, but in New South Wales, it is illegal. In the United Kingdom, tail docking is only permitted for working dogs and is banned for dogs bred as pets or showing. Other countries that have banned tail docking include: Norway in 1987, and Sweden in 1988. In the last four years Cyprus, Greece, Luxembourg and Switzerland have also decided to introduce a ban on tail docking. Historically, tails were docked in the UK to avoid taxation of sporting dogs. Today, proponents of tail docking argue working Norwich Terriers should have a docked tail because there is less risk of damaging the tail or spine if it is used to extract the dog from a hole. Some proponents suggest the docked tail makes for a prettier breed silhouette. Opponents of tail docking note that docking severely damages the important canine tail-signalling system, so vital to dogs' social communication. Where form follows function, the tail assists the dog with balance for movement over rough terrain and turning at speed. Arguments for and against tail docking are covered in this Michigan State University (Detroit College of Law) paper, including \\"History\\": Breeding Young Norwich Terrier Norwich Terriers are difficult to breed. Many have Caesarean sections. The North American average litter size for 2007 is two puppies with the total number of puppies for the year, in the USA, at approximately 750. There are breeding lines with higher average litter sizes as can be easily traced in pedigrees of kennel clubs who include such information, i.e. The Dutch Kennel Club. Similar information can be obtained at internet site of Finnish Kennel Club. Recently in the United States, there has been significant pedigree fraud.The Norwich & Norfolk News, Number 93, Fall 2006, published by the Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club Sometimes these fake Norwich Terriers are sold over the internet. History The breed has existed since at least the late 19th century as a working terrier of East Anglia, England. The dogs were useful as ratters in the stable yard, bolters of fox for the hunt, and family companions. It was the mascot of Cambridge students.Read, Joan R. The Norfolk Terrier, Third Edition, American Norfolk Terrier Association (ANTA), 2005. Small red terriers, descendants of Irish Terriers, had existed in the area since at least the 1860s, and these might be the ancestors of the Norwich, or it might have come from the Trumpington Terrier, a breed that no longer exists. In its earliest history, it was also known as the Jones Terrier and the Cantab Terrier. Since its earliest identification as a breed, puppies have had either drop or prick ears, and both were allowed when the Norwich was first recognized in the show ring in 1932 by The Kennel Club (England). Drop ears were often cropped until it became illegal to do so. This intensified a long-standing controversy over whether drop-eared dogs should be allowed in the show ring and whether the primary difference was simply the ears or whether other, deeper, personality and structural differences marked the drop-eared variety. Starting in the 1930s, breeders increased their efforts to distinguish the breeds. While Norfolk and Norwich Terriers were inter-bred for a number of years today they are positively two distinctive breeds. In fact some historical texts indicate that they were distinctive breeds before they were inter-bred. Both ear types continued to be allowed in the ring until The Kennel Club recognized the drop- eared variety as a separate breed, the Norfolk Terrier, in 1964, and the American Kennel Club, United Kennel Club, and Canadian Kennel Club did the same in 1979. Until that time, the breeds were designated by the AKC as Norwich Terriers, P.E. (prick ears) and Norwich Terriers, D.E. (drop ears).

Chamberlain described Holden as well-spoken, intelligent, and physically quite large, as well as perhaps the most ruthless of the roving band of mercenaries led by Glanton, with whom Chamberlain briefly traveled after the war. Holden, Chamberlain describes, \\"had a fleshy frame, [and] a dull tallow colored face destitute of hair and all expression.\\" http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper/HNS/Scalpin/heads.html Chamberlain makes it very clear that he strongly disliked Holden: \\"I hated him at first sight, and he knew it,\\" Chamberlain wrote. \\"Yet nothing could be more gentle and kind than his deportment towards me; he would often seek conversation with me.\\" Sepich, John Emil. ‚ÄúThe Dance of History in Cormac McCarthy's ‚ÄòBlood Meridian.‚Äô‚Äù The Southern Literary Journal, vol. 24, no. 1, 1991, pp. 16‚Äì31.

A fictionalized Holden is a central character in Cormac McCarthy's 1985 Western novel Blood Meridian. In the novel, he and Glanton are the leaders of a pack of nomadic criminals who rob, rape, torture, and kill across the borderlands between the United States and Mexico. Throughout the novel, Holden brutally murders dozens of people, including children. Searching for additional evidence for Holden's existence has been a hobby for some Cormac McCarthy scholars. As depicted in Blood Meridian, Holden is a mysterious figure, a cold-blooded killer, and, it is implied, a child-rapist; aside from the children he openly kills, he is seen enticing children with sweets, and a child often goes missing when he is in the vicinity. At one point in the novel, he is seen naked with a naked twelve- year-old girl in his room. Holden displays a preternatural breadth of knowledge, including paleontology, archaeology, linguistics, law, technical drawing, geology, chemistry, prestidigitation, and philosophy. He is described as seven feet tall and completely bereft of body hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes. He is massive in frame, enormously strong, an excellent musician and dancer, a fine draftsman, exceptionally articulate and persuasive in several languages, and an unerring marksman. His skin is so pale as to have almost no pigment. This strange appearance, as well as his keen, extremely fast reflexes, strength, agility, apparent immunity to sleep and aging, and multifarious other abilities point to his being something other than a normal human. In the final pages of the novel, McCarthy makes more direct reference to the Judge as a supernatural entity, or even as a concept personified. In 2002, Book magazine rated Holden as the 43rd greatest character in fiction since 1900. He is regarded as one of the greatest character of modern literature, likened to a \\"Captain Ahab of the desert.\\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/desperately-seeking-cormac/ Harold Bloom described him as \\"short of Moby Dick, the most monstrous apparition in all of American literature.\\"https://www.avclub.com/harold-bloom- on-blood-meridian-1798216782 =Scholarly debate= In his essay \\"Gravers False and True: Blood Meridian as Gnostic Tragedy\\", literature professor Leo Daugherty argued that McCarthy's Holden is--or at least embodies--a gnostic archon, a kind of demon. Harold Bloom, who declared McCarthy's Holden to be \\"the most frightening figure in all of American literature\\", has even come to regard The Judge as immortal. However, unlike Daugherty, Bloom argues that The Judge defies identification as any being under any \\"system\\" such as Gnosticism, citing the passage in the book stating that there was no \\"system by which to divide [The Judge] back into his origins\\". Rather, Bloom \\"resort[s]\\" to literary comparison with Shakespeare's Iago, a methodical dispenser of strife.

Codenamed 'C6' in development, the car was styled in the United Kingdom by Roy Axe and his team at Whitley, and the car was engineered by Simca at Poissy in France. A modern, front-wheel drive hatchback, it was one of the earliest such cars in the class, along with the Volkswagen Passat, and became the 1976 European Car of the Year. It had been in development since 1972. The model was sold under a variety of names, including Simca 1308 and 1309 models (with larger engines), Chrysler Alpine (UK, Ireland and New Zealand), Dodge Alpine (Colombia), Chrysler 150 (Spanish market), and later Talbot 1510 / Talbot Alpine / Talbot 150 (a facelifted version launched by PSA after its takeover of Chrysler Europe) and Talbot Solara (the saloon version). History Originally the car was powered by 1294 cc and 1442 ccc versions of the \\"Poissy engine\\" with electronic ignition and a four-speed gearbox. From launch it was available in three trim levels: GL, S and GT. Equipment levels were high, with the later GLS version featuring central door locking and electric windows, accessories that up until then had only generally featured in larger more upmarket cars. Having won the Car of the Year award, it was initially a success both at home and in the export. Production levels shot up from a daily 400 at introduction in September 1975 to 850 in December of that year, to 1100 a day in late 1976. The 1307 (7 CV) had the smaller engine, while the 1308 (8 CV) received the larger version. Unlike the other models, the more sporting 1307 S received twin Weber carburettors in continental European markets to provide a more powerful and revvy engine while remaining in a lower tax category. In the UK, the 1307 S has the same single Solex carburettor as the GL. Finnish-built Talbot 1510, facelifted version with new headlights More upmarket models were designated 1308 (1508 in some markets, reflecting the size of the engine) and 1309 (similarly sold as a 1609 in a few markets). All of the models replaced the Simca 1301/1501 range in France, while on the British market it was sold alongside the ageing Hillman Hunter, a rear-wheel drive range of saloons and estates which would continue until 1979. This type of car was generally more popular in Britain in 1975, with the best-selling cars in this sector being the Ford Cortina and Morris Marina. The Chrysler Alpine was first sold in Britain in January 1976, going on sale just after the similar-sized Vauxhall Cavalier, a rear-wheel drive saloon which consistently outsold it. Styled by Roy Axe, the Simca 1307, along with the recently introduced Volkswagen Passat, was one of several full-size European family hatchback inspired by the Renault 16 that had defined the sector back in 1965. In the 1970s the most popular mid-size cars in Europe were still traditional sedans like Ford Taunus (Ford Cortina in Britain), Opel Ascona B (Vauxhall Cavalier) and Morris Marina, and indeed it would be the next generations of those competing vehicles (the Ford Sierra and the Ascona C) before the concept became fully accepted in the mainstream. Near the end of the original model's run, the Italian importer marketed a sporty and luxurious version of the bigger-engined 1308 GT. Called the \\"1308 GLS Superstrada\\", it featured alloy wheels, black striped along the lower flanks, and all chrome (aside from the pentastar logo) was blacked out. =Facelift and Solara= For 1980 the car, which was now sold under the Talbot-brand, received an extensive facelift. The new model, shown at the Frankfurt Show, was known as the Talbot 1510 (the Talbot Alpine name was used in the UK).Automotive News, Crain Automotive Group, 1980, page 4 It received new front and rear lights and the new top of the range SX featured alloy wheels, cruise control, headlamp wash/wipe, power steering and trip computer. Automatic transmission and a five-speed gearbox also became available. The lineup became clearer, with the 1307 GLS replaced by the 1510 LS, the 1307 S by the GL, the 1308 GT by the GLS, and finally the 1309 SX by the 1510 SX (automatic transmission only at first). A four-door saloon version, called the Talbot Solara, was released in the same year, with either 1.3 or 1.6 engines, and was produced alongside the hatchback version. Trim levels were similar to the Alpine. It effectively took over from the Hunter, axed a year earlier, as the four-door large family saloon in the range. In the Benelux countries, a well-equipped \\"Ultra\\" special edition with metallic paint, alloy wheels, and velour interior, appeared in December 1983. Talbot Solara SX, rear view French manufacturing of 1510, Alpine and Solara, along with the smaller Horizon, ended in 1986. In the United Kingdom the last cars were rebadged as the Rapier and Minx which were badged depending on trim level rather than body style. Production of the Alpine, Solara and Horizon models had already finished at Ryton in the autumn of 1985 to make way for the Peugeot 309. The names were sourced from the corporate ancestor of Chrysler Europe, the Rootes Group, having been used on the Sunbeam Rapier and Hillman Minx. Supply of these models was limited and in 1986 production ceased, with the Talbot marque being shelved soon afterwards on all passenger vehicles. Thus, the Alpine/1510/Solara series was not directly replaced; however the Citro√´n BX (already released in 1982) and the forthcoming Peugeot 405 (launched in late 1987) were effectively its de facto successors as PSA's entries in the D-segment. Both of these cars were very successful in Europe, and helped Citro√´n and Peugeot increase their market share in the UK and many other export markets. In early 1985, with the end of production nearing, Finnish assemblers Saab-Valmet began offering the Talbot 1510 GLD, using PSA's 1.9-liter XUD9 diesel engine with . This was the only diesel-engined version of the Simca 1307 ever offered; PSA's Spanish had worked on such a model but work was never completed due to internal competition from the 305 and BX. Valmet did not offer the Solara with the diesel engine so as to avoid competing in-house with the 305 Diesel, as they were both saloons. Whilst very many units were sold in France, the Chrysler Alpine did not fulfill its potential in the UK, initially losing out to contemporaries such as the Ford Cortina/Sierra and the Vauxhall Cavalier primarily due to the lack of larger engines (Ford and Vauxhall offered 2.0L engines in their products, whilst the Alpine/Solara range topped out at a 1.6L unit). The Alpine's OHV Simca engines were particularly \\"tappety\\" and unrefined compared to the more modern overhead camshaft units of its rivals with further dented its appeal. In more recent years, due to corrosion problems similar to those of the Horizon few Alpines have survived in the UK. As of 2017 there were only 19 examples (including the later Talbot-badged versions) were still licensed on British roads. However, the car has fared better in its native France, where it still has a cult following among Simca enthusiasts and many hundreds are still in service. The body styling of the Simca 1307 was the direct inspiration for the design of Russian Moskvitch Aleko (1986‚Äì2001)The East European motor industry: prospects & developments, Economist Intelligence Unit, 1989, page 46 Manufacture The car was originally manufactured in Poissy in France, in Ryton in the United Kingdom, from 1977 in Villaverde in Barreiros, subsidiary of Chrysler Europe in Spain, and assembled from CKD kits by Todd Motors (later Mitsubishi Motors NZ) in New Zealand between 1977 and 1984. It was also assembled in Colombia as Dodge Alpine between 1978 and 1982 at the Chrysler Colmotores in Bogot√°.Importaciones de autom√≥viles y camperos: documento para Consejo Directivo de Comercio Exterior, INCOMEX, Instituto Colombiano de Comercio Exterior, 1982, page 20 Between 1979 and 1985 the car was also built by Saab- Valmet in Uusikaupunki factory in Finland. Saab-Valmet was only interested in building the smaller Horizon, but Simca-Talbot would only license it if Valmet also agreed to assemble the larger 1307. The Finnish-made cars gradually introduced some local changes, including the option of a diesel engine, and featured many Saab interior parts. The most visible Saab-parts were the seats, which began to use Saab's internal structure at the time that the Talbot name replaced Simca. This change also allowed for the fitment of a heated driver's seat, which was not originally available. Talbot did not allow Valmet to export any Finnish-built cars; they were only meant for local sales. In New Zealand, Chrysler, Talbot, Alpine, and 1510 badges were used on the car during its lifetime, though it was officially in price lists as an Alpine, following the UK convention.Parliamentary Debates, New Zealand. Parliament, House of Representatives, 15 Aug 1978, page 2323The New Zealand Journal of Agriculture, New Zealand Department of Agriculture, 1981, page 51 In 1982 the car was facelifted and renamed \\"Talbot SX\\" there.

The battle took place in Thuringia in what was the Ernestine duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. The battle was the second clash in the Prussian Campaign of the War of the Fourth Coalition. Background =French Movements= Jean Lannes Napoleon had arranged the Grand Arm√©e into three columns to cross the Thuringian Forest to attack the Prussian-Saxon army. The westernmost column was headed by V Corps commanded by Jean Lannes, with Pierre Augereau's VII Corps following behind. They had orders to march from Coburg via Gr√§fenthal due at Saalfeld on 11 October. V Corps set out on 8 October, and by the end of 9 October was at Gr√§fenthal with light cavalry on the road to Saalfeld. At 5am on 10 October, Lannes with Louis-Gabriel Suchet's division and Anne-Fran√ßois-Charles Trelliard brigade of light cavalry of V corps began advancing down the road to Saalfeld, aware that a Prussian-Saxon force was in front of them. =Prussian-Saxon movements= Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia Prince Louis Ferdinand commanded the Advanced Guard of Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen's army and on 9 October the Prince his headquarters at Rudolstadt, with detachments at Saalfeld, , and Bad Blankenburg. The Prince had received a message from Hohenlohe that the Prussian-Saxon army would be advancing across the River Saale to support Bogislav Friedrich Emanuel von Tauentzien's force after the Battle of Schleiz, and that Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel's main army would be advancing to Rudolstadt. In the evening of 9 October Oberst Leopold Ludwig Maximilian Nordeck zu Rabenau (who commanded a detachment at Saalfeld) reported to Prince Louis that a French column of between 16,000 to 20,000 men had left Coburg heading for Saalfeld and that a post of 30 hussars stationed at Gr√§fenthal and the J√§ger Company \\"Valentini\\" stationed at had both retreated to Arnsgereuth after clashing with the French. Knowing that the main body of the army under Hohenlohe was due to advance across the River Saale on 10 October, Prince Louis therefore decided that his forces needed to stop the French column from either crossing the Saale at Saalfeld and interfering with Hohenlohe‚Äôs movements or from moving up the western side of the Saale to Rudolstadt, which they would reach before Brunswick‚Äôs army. During 9 October a fusilier company commanded by August von Gneisenau was sent to Arnsgereuth to support the troops there, and having confirmed that the French were advancing on Saalfeld and in strength, the Prussian troops withdrew from Arnsgereuth to , just outside Saalfeld, with advance posts in . At 7am Prince Louis began concentrating his troops at Saalfeld, and by 9am he had arranged his forces for battle. The troops were arranged in a line stretching from in front of Saalfeld to behind and facing the woods the covered the hills above Saalfeld and the Saale valley. The Prince left Generalmajor Karl Gerhard von Pelet's detachment at Blankenburg. =Order of battle= Battle Battle of Saalfeld At around 9.45AM, the advanced guard of V Corps, consisting of the corps' Bataillon d√©lite (formed of the elite companies of battalions left at depots), the 17th L√©g√®re Regiment, and two cannons, made its way towards Saalfeld and occupied the heights overlooking the town. The French light cavalry brigade and the advanced guard began to engage the Prussian-Saxon army. The Bataillon d√©lite supported by French skirmishers pushed out the Prussian troops from Garnsdorf and occupied it. As the French troops advanced and the Prussian- Saxon army prepared to fight them, Marshal Lannes noticed that the right flank of the Prussian-Saxon army was completely uncovered, and while the cavalry and French advanced guard engaged the Prussians around Garnsdorf and Saalfeld, he ordered rest of Suchet's division to march northwards through the woods to outflank the Prussian and Saxon line. To cover these moves, the 17th L√©g√®re Regiment formed a skirmish line that extended from Saalfeld to Beulwitz. Prince Louis was aware that he was engaged with a larger force, and then at 11am, Saxon Souslieutnant Heinrich August von Egidy brought a verbal order from Prince Hohenlohe to remain at Rudolstadt and that the offensive across the Saale had been abandoned. Prince Louis decided to try and disengage with the French and retreat to Rudolstadt. He ordered second battalion of the \\"M√ºffling\\" Regiment to Schwarza to hold the bridges, and sent troops under the Saxon Generalmajor to extend the right of his line to the hills either side of (known as the Oberhayn and Sandberg). He also ordered the \\"Prince Xaver\\" and \\"Kurf√ºrst\\" regiments to take the offensive by attacking the plain between Siechentbal and the Kesselthal streams. The skirmishers of the 17th L√©g√®re Regiment supported with the 34th Ligne Regiment (which had moved out of the woods into Beulwitz) repelled the Saxon regiments, who then fell back in disorder. Prince Louis rallied these troops, and fearing that he would lose communication with General Bevilaqua and his troops, he ordered another attack, and by midday the \\"Kurf√ºrst\\" regiment had captured Cr√∂sten. Thinking that his centre was secure, Prince Louis gave further orders for a withdrawal. The French had entered Saalfeld and were pushing the Prussian troops back to , where Prince Louis headed to rally these troops. At just before 1pm, Marshal Lannes gave the signal for the offensive. The 34th, 40th, and 64th Ligne headed towards the Saxon troops around Aue am Berg, whilst the French cavalry, with the 88th Ligne behind them, moved forward between Cr√∂sten and Saalfeld. Prince Louis decided this was a moment to engage the French cavalry with the Prussian and Saxon cavalry, attacking an exposed flank of the 21st Chasseurs √† Cheval. However, the second line of French cavalry then enveloped the Prince's outnumbered cavalry line. Order in the Prussian and Saxon cavalry began to break down, and they fled joining the troops retreating from Saalfeld. In the confused mass around W√∂hlsdorf, many were cut down by the French hussars and some drowned trying to escape across the Saale. Prince Louis tried to cut his way out towards Schwarza, during which he was attacked by Quartermaster Guindet of the 10th Hussars. Although wounded, Prince Louis refused to surrender and was killed. Meanwhile, on the Prussian-Saxon right, General Bevilaqua tried to reinforce the Sandberg with the \\"Prinz Clemens\\" regiment, but then seeing the rout at W√∂hlsdorf, Bevilaqua ordered a retreat to Scwharza. As the first battalion of the \\"Prince Clemens\\" Regiment moved down the slope it was attacked repeatedly by the 21st Chasseurs √† Cheval, and the Saxons broke under the onslaught. the 21st Chasseurs √† Cheval then assaulted and successively broke the second battalion \\"Prinz Clemens\\" Regiment and first battalion \\"M√ºffling\\" Regiment. As these troops dispersed, General Bevilaqua was captured. There was a final conflict at Schwarza and Pelet's force engaged the French around Unter-Wirbach. Pelet's force was largely intact but had to retreat to Stadt-Ilm, which it reached at 10pm. The French cavalry pursued the remains of the Prussian and Saxon units to Rudolstadt, but the French infantry halted at Schwarza. Some of the Prussian and Saxon troops that had escaped onto the east side of the Saale withdrew towards Rudolstadt. Aftermath Prince Louis' force had been completely dispersed as a fighting force. Only Pelet's detachment was intact, and they were forced to take a long route to rejoin Hohenlohe. Despite this battle and the battle of Schliez, Napoleon was still not fully aware of location of the Prussian army. After four days of further marches, the French engaged the Prussians and Saxons at the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt on the plateau west of the river Saale.

Styled by Sergio Sartorelli at Fiat's Centro Stile in Turin, export versions for most English-speaking markets were marketed as the Strada. In 1979, SEAT Ritmo production began in Spain, with a facelift in 1982, the SEAT Ronda. The name Ritmo derives from the Italian for \\"rhythm\\", and Strada derives from the Italian for \\"road.\\" Production reached a total of 1,790,000 and ended in early 1988 it was replaced by the Fiat Tipo. Development A first-series Fiat Strada-cum-Ritmo (UK) Fiat began designing the Ritmo hatchback ‚Äì as a replacement for the 128 sedan ‚Äì in 1972, following the body style of its 127 supermini as European manufacturers began launching small family hatchbacks, notably the Volkswagen Golf in 1974. Prior to its launch, the press speculated that the project codename 138 would be the final production name, however, Fiat instead gave its new car the Ritmo name, rather than another three digit number. The Ritmo was manufactured at the Cassino plant using a system developed by its subsidiary Comau, the \\"Robogate\\" system ‚Äì which automated the bodyshell assembly and welding process using robots, giving rise to its advertising slogan \\"Handbuilt by robots\\", immortalised in a television advertising campaign showing the robots assembling the Ritmo bodyshells to the strains of Rossini's The Barber of Seville. The exterior has plastic bumper fascias integrated into the styling which combined strong round shapes with overall sharp lines, achieving a , =First series (1978)= The initial four-cylinder engine range included 1.1-litre (), 1.3-litre () and 1.5-litre () petrol engines, which were reasonably refined and economical. Suspension was independent all-round, the braking system comprised front discs and rear drums and the wheels measured 13-inch in diameter. Gearboxes ranged from a standard four-speed manual (five- speed optional on CL models) and an optional three-speed Volkswagen-derived automatic. Its boot capacity ranged from 330 to 1,100 litres. The Ritmo finished second in the European Car of the Year awards, finishing narrowly behind the winning car, the Simca-Chrysler Horizon ‚Äì which was similar in concept. The initial range in Italy was designated by their respective engine horsepower (PS): * 60 L (3- and 5-door, priced ‚Ç§4,407,000 to 4,608,000) (prices in lire) * 60 CL (3- and 5-door, priced ‚Ç§4,679,000 to 4,879,000) * 65 L (5-door, priced ‚Ç§4,726,000) * 65 CL (3- and 5-door, priced ‚Ç§4,797,000 to 4,997,000) The CL range were the better-equipped models (with the 60 CL comprising 80% of total initial sales in Italy) and the whole range also distinguished itself by having numerous optional accessories unseen in past Fiat cars. These included: larger tyres; a rev counter; stereo system; safety seatbelts and headrests; passenger-side rear view mirror; split-fold rear seat; tinted windows; rear window wiper; rear window defroster; metallic paint; sunroof (the most expensive at ‚Ç§259,60). The instrumentation was incorporated in a rectangular pod with modular slots that could house various gauges and switches, either standard depending on the model or optional (e.g. digital clock and switches for hazard lights or adjustable-speed ventilation fan). Export markets also received the 1.5-litre 75 CL with a five-speed manual, a model which was initially unavailable in the domestic Italian market. The colour of the interiors was determined by the external paint, as follows: * beige interior: azzurro rodi (light blue), rosso cina (red), verde Kent (green) and metallic verde medio (medium green); * blue interior: bianco yacht (white), blu lord (royal blue) and metallic azzurro (light blue) and alluminio (silver); * brown interior: arancio messico (orange), grigio jet (grey) and metallic rosso rame (copper). The Ritmo was criticized for its basic interior trim (e.g. no fabric on door panels). Fiat responded in 1979 with various revisions and the introduction of the Targa Oro (\\"gold plate\\") range. The latter was based on the Ritmo 65 (or 75 for export markets) and was distinguished by mink or black paint with gold striping and accents in the alloy wheels, foglights, dark bumper bars and velour trim interiors. From February 1979, the 75 CL range had an optional VW-derived automatic transmission ‚Äì the Automatica was the only 1.5-engined version marketed in Italy. At the same time, the 60 L models for Italy and some export markets had its 1.1-litre 128-derived engine replaced by a 1049 cc petrol engine built by Fiat of Brazil. Through the use of a new carburetor and altered timing, power and torque figures were kept the same as those of the 1.1, up by ten horsepower over what the engine produced as installed in the 127. The 60 CL - the fastest-selling Ritmo in the Italian market at the time \\\\- continued to use the comparable 1116 cc engine. At the 1980 Geneva Motor Show, a five-door only diesel version ‚Äì marketed as the Ritmo D and available in both L and CL trim ‚Äì was introduced with a 1,714 cc engine (). To accommodate this considerably heavier engine, the steering rack was slowed down (from 3.5 to 4 turns) and the suspension adjusted. Nonetheless, a 65.5% forward weight distribution was hard to mask and both handling and braking suffered when compared to petrol-powered Ritmos. In 1981, the Targa Oro and 75 models were replaced by the five-door only Ritmo Super (or Superstrada in some export markets). They brought higher specification and fittings (from chrome trimmings to a more complete instrumentation and optional central locking), larger, 14-inch, wheels and, most significantly, revised engines with (1300) and (1500). This extra power was gained through slight alterations to the camshaft profile, a twin carburettor, and a twin exhaust system. Other differences included lower profile tyres (Pirelli P8) and a close-ratio five- speed manual gearbox. The steering was also somewhat faster.Salon 1981, p. 91 By this time, the Ritmo range in Italy also included three- and five-door manual versions of the 75 CL and three-door 75 CL Automatica, with the price of the popular 60CL now ranging from ‚Ç§6,868,000 to 7,180,000 for the three- and five-door versions, respectively. In May 1981, the first sports version, the Ritmo 105 TC, was launched. Available only as a three-door, it was powered by a Fiat DOHC engine with a displacement of 1,585 cc, which was derived from that used in the 131 and 132 models. This car had the same wheels as the Ritmo Super, but with black centre hubcaps. British and Irish models had black and silver Speedline alloy wheels (5.5 x 14) as standard. Other distinguishing features relative to the normal range included: front fog lights integrated into the front bumper; integrated front spoiler combined with wheel arch extensions; black lower door paint; black mesh air intake; and a rear spoiler at the base of the rear window. That same year, Fiat also launched the Ritmo Cabrio. In September 1981, Fiat displayed the Ritmo Abarth 125 TC at the Frankfurt Motor Show. This model was not available for right-hand export markets because the position of the exhaust downpipe did not allow for a relocated steering column and system. The 125 TC was a modified and revised 105 TC with a 1,995 cc DOHC four with , ventilated front discs, a new five- speed ZF manual gearbox, revised suspension settings and strengthened components. Outwardly, the 125 TC differed only slightly from the 105 TC ‚Äì it gained the chunky four-spoke 14 in alloys later seen on the Bertone Cabrio models, featured an \\"Abarth\\" red and black badge on the rear hatch, and the side badges featured the Abarth \\"Scorpion\\". The 125 TC version had a top speed of and it could accelerate from 0 to in 8.7 seconds. These cars were the last ones assembled on a separate Abarth production line, following the Fiat buyout in 1971. =Second series (1982)= A second-series Fiat Ritmo 3-door A second-series Fiat Strada Abarth 130 TC A second-series Fiat/Bertone Ritmo Cabrio In October 1982, the Ritmo was reengineered and restyled to improve its competitiveness against rivals, which included the MK3 Ford Escort and the first front-wheel drive Opel Kadett (Vauxhall Astra in the UK). The chassis was lighter by and benefitted from better noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) control. Suspension mounts were altered and the spare tyre was moved from the engine bay to the boot, along with a relocation of the fuel tank to ahead of the rear axle. The fuel tank move resulted in the fuel cap being moved to the right side and under a lid instead of remaining exposed. The facelift saw the Ritmo acquire a more conventional look. For example, the round headlights no longer intersected the bumper bar but were now integrated in a separate grille, and the tail lights were similarly integrated into the body instead of inset in the rear bumper. In addition, all models now featured Fiat's new corporate five-bar emblem at the centre of the grille, with base models featuring single round headlamps and all other, double round headlights (in Britain, all models of this generation featured twin headlamps). The bonnet no longer had an air scoop and the roof was now completely flat (with the upward sweep of the first series found to cause vortices and contribute to dust and water over the rear window). The 1,049 cc \\"Brazil\\" engine was discontinued. Better aerodynamics, lower weight, and engine optimizations combined to increase fuel mileage by around ten percent on most of the range. The 105 TC was relaunched with revised interior trim, a dashboard similar to that of the earlier Ritmo Super and an upper hatchback spoiler in place of the lower one. In Britain, seven-spoke alloy wheels replaced the earlier Speedline ones. In British advertising the car was named Strada II, but it was badged as the Strada. The North American version was unchanged but was finally discontinued at the end of the 1982 model year (at which time the Fiat range included only the X1/9 and the 124 Spider). In 1983, Fiat completed the range with the Ritmo ES (\\"energy saving\\") models and the hot hatch, Ritmo Abarth 130 TC. The latter was based on the 125 TC but was powered by a 1995 cc engine with power output increased to . This was achieved by replacing the single Weber carb used in the 125 TC with twin Solex/Weber carburettors on a side-draught manifold, and via improved cam profiles. The 130 TC had a top speed of and accelerated from 0 to in 7.8 seconds. It was fitted with Recaro bucket seats in Britain (optional in Europe) and it remained the only 1980s European hot hatch to continue utilise carburettors instead of fuel injection. Ignition timing was controlled electronically. Although appearing outwardly similar to the restyled 105 TC with its lower door and wheelarch trims, the 130 TC could be distinguished by its polished four-spoke alloy wheels (continued from the earlier 125 TC), aerodynamic perspex front door wind deflectors, and lower hatchback spoiler. The powerful twin-cam was mated to a close ratio five-speed ZF manual gearbox and had superior performance to its contemporary rivals, which included the Volkswagen Golf GTI, Ford Escort XR3i, Vauxhall Astra GTE and the MG Maestro. There was a minor change in the spring of 1984, mainly consisting of a new range hierarchy. Aside from the three-door, four-speed \\"L\\" versions (\\"60\\" and \\"diesel\\"), all non-sporting Ritmos now had five-speed manual gearboxes and five-door bodywork. The upper-class 85 Super version was dropped in Italy, where smaller-engined versions ruled the marketplace. The 1.1 litre 60 Super models were new to the lineup. This Ritmo (and the third series) was also built in Venezuela, only in the five-door version. Two models were available: the 85 and the 105TC, with the 85 only available with the automatic transmission from Volkswagen and the 105TC being a five-speed manual. Unique to Venezuela was the fact that the 105TC was not offered in a three-door version, the only option available in the rest of the world. =Third series (1985)= A third-series Fiat Ritmo 1985 saw a minor facelift to the Ritmo range, featuring new rectangular door handles on five-door versions (the three-door retained circular door handles), shared with the Regata ‚Äì the Ritmo-derived sedan. Other changes included restyled front and rear bumpers, and lower plastic panels on the doors (again, taken from the Regata). The rear bumper now housed the number plate at low level, whilst the space between the rear lights was filled with a plastic panel. The 1,714 cc diesel engine was replaced with a 1,697 cc unit from the Uno 60D, developing . The three-door 105 TC model was replaced by the five-door Ritmo 100 S (also fitted with a 1,585 cc DOHC engine). The 130 TC Abarth benefitted from the same external changes as the other models, in addition to new wheels and interior trim. In 1986, a new diesel version was launched with a 1,929 cc intercooled turbodiesel (), and was badged as the Ritmo Turbo DS (as a five- door only). While marketed across continental Europe, the 100 S and the Turbo DS were not sold in Great Britain or Ireland, nor were any of the fuel injected models. The latter included the 75 i.e. and 90 i.e., which had lower outputs due to their catalytic converters fitted to meet tougher export markets' emission regulations. By this stage, however, Ritmo/Strada sales were declining outside Italy, not helped by its reputation for unreliability and rust, nor the growing number of competitors which were appearing. However, the Ritmo's falling popularity in these markets was compensated for by the growing success of its smaller stablemate, the Uno. To spur more sales, in 1986 Fiat launched two limited editions: * the Ritmo Team (with 60 and D engines and based on a five-door CL) in May; and * the Ritmo Super Team (with 60, 70 and 100 engines fitted with central locking, power windows and adjustable steering wheel). Early in 1988, the production of the Ritmo ended after 10 years. In its place, as the new contender in the European C-segment, Fiat launched the similarly avantgarde, Tipo, which took inspiration from the smaller Uno with its design and style. Other models or variants The Fiat Ritmo cabrio was originally displayed as a concept at the 1979 Frankfurt Motor Show but went on sale in 1981. It was assembled by Bertone and, coinciding with the 1982 facelift, was badged as a Bertone instead of a Fiat. It was cheaper than, and competed against, the Volkswagen Golf cabriolet but was not up to Volkswagen standards in terms of quality or ability, despite the fact that the German rival was not built in-house, but by Karmann. The Bertone cabriolet was sold in various European markets in petrol-engined form only (75S, 85S, 100S; some with fuel injection) until 1988. There were various special editions including the Ritmo Cabrio Chrono and Ritmo Cabrio Bianco (all white). A sedan version, the Regata, was launched in 1983 with limited success outside of Italy despite being sold more globally, including in Australia. Mechanically similar to the Ritmo, the sedan was offered with 1.3, 1.5 and 1.6-litre petrol engines, and diesel 1.7 and 1.9-litre or 1.9-litre turbodiesel engines. A station wagon version‚Äîbadged the Regata Weekend‚Äîwas launched in 1984 and a unique design feature was represented by its folding rear bumper section, which created a level loading bay. The Regata received a minor facelift in 1986 (bumpers, doors and interior) as well as fuel injection fitted for some engines ‚Äì most notably the 1,585 cc \\"100S i.e.\\" Alternate names =Fiat Strada= A facelifted first-series Fiat Strada (UK) The Ritmo was sold on the British market as the Strada from the autumn of 1978 until it was replaced by the Tipo in July 1988. Despite decent early sales, surprising given its unconventional styling, it was soon overshadowed by a host of new British-built and imported competitors, and by the 1980s was selling very slowly, although Fiat's overall market share in the UK increased sharply throughout the 1980s due to the huge success of the smaller Uno. In North America, the Fiat Strada was introduced in January 1979 (for the same model year) to replace the 128. Available with either three or five doors, it used the same 1.5-litre SOHC engine as the X1/9 coup√© (generating ) and featured a standard five-speed manual gearbox. A three-speed automatic from Volkswagen was optional equipment. For 1981 the engine gained fuel injection for all states, meaning that power increased to . In spite of a roomy interior and comfortable ride, the Strada failed to convince enough buyers to forget reliability issues from previous Fiat models and was withdrawn from North America in 1982. Strict North American collision standards resulted in this Strada featuring extended plastic bumper bars. =SEAT Ritmo= Spanish car maker SEAT began their history as a Fiat licensee from 1948, manufacturing clones of the Italian cars. From 1979 to 1982, a Spanish version of the Ritmo, the SEAT Ritmo, was produced in Spain near Barcelona. The original SEAT Ritmo was equipped with licence-built pushrod engines from the old Fiat 124. The end of the above partnership began in 1982, coinciding with a new SEAT logo and the launch of the \\"System Porsche\\"-engined SEAT Ronda, which remained in production until 1986. An intellectual property dispute arose and was ultimately resolved by the Arbitration Chamber of Paris in 1983, which found that the Ronda was sufficiently different from the Ritmo (much to the angst of Fiat due to rumours that its restyle was very close to that of the Ronda). As part of this dispute, SEAT showed a black Ronda with all the in-house developed components painted in bright yellow, in order to highlight key differences between the two products. In 1982, SEAT entered into a new licensing agreement, this time with Volkswagen. In 1984, SEAT manufactured the new Giugiaro-designed and \\"System Porsche\\"-engined Ibiza, which still had Ritmo underpinnings. Moreover, mirroring the Regata, in 1985 SEAT also developed and launched the four-door M√°laga sedan. All ties with Fiat underpinnings were finally severed when Volkswagen took majority ownership of SEAT in 1986 and began producing cars in Spain based on German- developed platforms. Revival of the Ritmo name The Ritmo name was revived in Australia by the Fiat importer, Ateco Automotive, with the new Bravo sold there with Ritmo badging beginning in February 2008. This rebadging was due to the fact that, in Australia, Mazda had been using the name Bravo for its B Series pickup. Although pre-launch indication were that the Ritmo name would also be used for New Zealand, this never eventuated since Fiat were able to use the Bravo nameplate there. The new Ritmo sold slowly and was discontinued in 2009; the name has remained retired since.

The concept is found in Indian philosophy and in ancient Egypt as well as Judaic wisdom literature (Ecclesiastes) and was subsequently taken up by the Pythagoreans and Stoics. With the decline of antiquity and the spread of Christianity, the concept largely fell into disuse in the Western world, with the exception of 19th Century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who connected the thought to many of his other concepts, including amor fati. Eternal return relates in conjunction to the philosophy of predeterminism in that people are predestined to continue repeating the same events over and over again. Premise The basic premise proceeds from the assumption that the probability of a world coming into existence exactly like our own is nonzero. If space and time are infinite, then it follows logically that our existence must recur an infinite number of times.Tegmark M., \\"Parallel universes\\". Sci. Am. 2003 May; 288(5):40‚Äì51.. In 1871, Louis Auguste Blanqui, assuming a Newtonian cosmology where time and space are infinite, claimed to have demonstrated eternal recurrence as a mathematical certainty.  Classical antiquity  Scarab on a fresco. In ancient Egypt, the scarab (dung beetle) was viewed as a sign of eternal renewal and reemergence of life, a reminder of the life to come. (See also Atum and Ma'at.) The Mayans and Aztecs also took a cyclical view of time. The book of Ecclesiastes in the Hebrew Bible states: \\"What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.\\" (New International Version). In ancient Greece, the concept of eternal return was connected with Empedocles, Zeno of Citium, and most notably in Stoicism (see ekpyrosis, palingenesis). The idea is also suggested in Virgil's Aeneid. In Book 6 of the poem (lines 724‚Äì51), the hero, Aeneas, descends into the Underworld and learns from Anchises‚Äîhis deceased father whose soul lives on in Elysium‚Äîthat a system of metempsychosis secures the continuation of the human race: after death, each human soul undergoes a period of expurgation, cleansing themselves of the impurity accrued during their embodied life on earth. Most souls, however, are condemned to return to an embodied existence on earth (rather than move on to Elysium, like Anchises). And yet, before they return to that life, they are summoned by \\"god\\" to the River Lethe, where they drink the water and come to forget what they have experienced‚Äîviz., all the suffering and punishment for their \\"sins\\", and the struggles and toil that went along with their previous embodied existence. In other words, right as they enter into their new embodied existences, they are made ignorant, both of what they did in their previous existence that incurred all the penalties in the afterlife, and indeed of the penalties themselves. They are, then, forced into a position where they are more or less doomed to repeat their wrongdoings, all the while remaining unaware of the cost that those wrongdoings will bring upon them. One scholar, David QuintEpic and Empire: the Politics of Generic Form from Virgil to Milton (Yale University Press: 1993), has argued that this moment in Virgil's poem is illustrative of the therapeutic effects of oblivion‚Äîof the way that the act of forgetting secures the continuation of life. That is one interpretation, but the point seems to strike a more tragic note about the way humans are condemned to act out the same errors time and again because of enforced ignorance. The Aeneid is, more generally, accepted as having a thoroughly tragic outlook on human existence (a landmark study on this is W. R. Johnson's Darkness Visible(1976); see also P. R. Hardie, \\"Virgil and Tragedy\\" in the volume The Cambridge Companion to Virgil, edited by C. Martindale (Cambridge University Press: 1997)).  Indian religions  Life circle in Vajrayana The concept of cyclical patterns is prominent in Indian religions, such as Jainism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism among others. The important distinction is that events don't repeat endlessly but souls take birth until they attain salvation. The wheel of life represents an endless cycle of birth, life, and death from which one seeks liberation. In Tantric Buddhism, a wheel of time concept known as the Kalachakra expresses the idea of an endless cycle of existence and knowledge.  Friedrich Nietzsche  The concept of \\"eternal recurrence\\"‚Äì‚Äì\\"the idea that all events in the world repeat themselves in the same sequence through an eternal series of cycles\\"‚Äì‚Äìis central to the mature writings of Friedrich Nietzsche. As Heidegger points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence, in aphorism 341 (\\"The Greatest Weight\\") of The Gay Science (cited below), presents this concept as a hypothetical question rather than postulating it as a fact. According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the question of eternal recurrence‚Äîwhether or not such a thing could possibly be true‚Äîthat is so significant in modern thought: \\"The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.' \\"See Heidegger Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same trans. David Farrell Krell. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25. Robert Wicks suggests that the concept of eternal recurrence, as portrayed in \\"The Greatest Weight,\\" \\"serves to draw attention away from all worlds other than the one in which we presently live, since eternal recurrence precludes the possibility of any final escape from the present world. Wick's analysis implies that eternal recurrence does not refer to the endless repetition of specific events, but rather the inescapable general circumstances that constitute existence in the physical world. The thought of eternal recurrence appears in a few of his works, in particular ¬ß285 and ¬ß341 of The Gay Science and then in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The most complete treatment of the subject appears in the work entitled Notes on the Eternal Recurrence, a work which was published in 2007 alongside S√∏ren Kierkegaard's own version of eternal return, which he calls 'repetition'. Nietzsche sums up his thought most succinctly when he addresses the reader with: \\"Everything has returned. Sirius, and the spider, and thy thoughts at this moment, and this last thought of thine that all things will return\\". However, he also expresses his thought at greater length when he says to his reader: > \\"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet here for the first > time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and > above us, and let me tell thee something of the thought which has suddenly > risen before me like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee > and every one, as befits the nature of light. ‚Äì Fellow man! Your whole life, > like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, ‚Äì a > long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you > were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will > find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope > and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, > and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which > you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these > cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one > man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal > recurrence of all things:‚Äì and for mankind this is always the hour of > Noon\\".Notes on the Eternal Recurrence ‚Äì Vol. 16 of Oscar Levy Edition of > Nietzsche's Complete Works (in English) This thought is indeed also noted in a posthumous fragment.1881 (11 [143]) The origin of this thought is dated by Nietzsche himself, via posthumous fragments, to August 1881, at Sils-Maria. In Ecce Homo (1888), he wrote that he thought of the eternal return as the \\"fundamental conception\\" of Thus Spoke Zarathustra.Nietzsche, Ecce Homo, \\"Why I Write Such Good Books\\", \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\", ¬ß1 Surlei\\". Several authors have pointed out other occurrences of this hypothesis in contemporary thought. Rudolf Steiner, who revised the first catalogue of Nietzsche's personal library in January 1896, pointed out that Nietzsche would have read something similar in Eugen D√ºhring's Courses on philosophy (1875), which Nietzsche readily criticized. Lou Andreas-Salom√© pointed out that Nietzsche referred to ancient cyclical conceptions of time, in particular by the Pythagoreans, in the Untimely Meditations. Henri Lichtenberger and Charles Andler have pinpointed three works contemporary to Nietzsche which carried on the same hypothesis: J.G. Vogt, Die Kraft. Eine real-monistische Weltanschauung (1878), Auguste Blanqui, L'√©ternit√© par les astres (1872) and Gustave Le Bon, L'homme et les soci√©t√©s (1881). Walter Benjamin juxtaposes Blanqui and Nietzsche's discussion of eternal recurrence in his unfinished, monumental work The Arcades Project.Walter Benjamin. The Arcades Project. Trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin. Cambridge: Belknap-Harvard, 2002. See chapter D, \\"Boredom Eternal Return,\\" pp. 101-119. However, Gustave Le Bon is not quoted anywhere in Nietzsche's manuscripts; and Auguste Blanqui was named only in 1883. Vogt's work, on the other hand, was read by Nietzsche during this summer of 1881 in Sils-Maria. and on the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure's website Blanqui is mentioned by Albert Lange in his Geschichte des Materialismus (History of Materialism), a book closely read by Nietzsche.Alfred Fouill√©e, \\"Note sur Nietzsche et Lange: le \\"retour √©ternel\\", in Revue philosophique de la France et de l'√©tranger. An. 34. Paris 1909. T. 67, S. 519-525 The eternal recurrence is also mentioned in passing by the Devil in Part Four, Book XI, Chapter 9 of Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, which is another possible source that Nietzsche may have been drawing upon. Walter Kaufmann suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered this idea in the works of Heinrich Heine, who once wrote: > [T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite. > They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, > the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the > configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them is also > determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal > laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all > configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, > attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again...Kaufmann, Walter. > Nietzsche; Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist. 1959, page 376. Nietzsche calls the idea \\"horrifying and paralyzing\\", referring to it as a burden of the \\"heaviest weight\\" (\\"das schwerste Gewicht\\")Kundera, Milan. The Unbearable Lightness of Being. 1999, page 5. imaginable. He professes that the wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life: > What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your > loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have > lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and > there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every > thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will > have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence' ... Would > you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who > spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would > have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more > divine. [The Gay Science, ¬ß341] To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires amor fati, \\"love of fate\\":Dudley, Will. Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom. 2002, page 201. > My formula for human greatness is amor fati: that one wants to have nothing > different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely to > bear the necessary, still less to conceal it‚Äîall idealism is mendaciousness > before the necessary‚Äîbut to love it. In Carl Jung's seminar on Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Jung claims that the dwarf states the idea of the eternal return before Zarathustra finishes his argument of the eternal return when the dwarf says, \\"'Everything straight lies,' murmured the dwarf disdainfully. 'All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.'\\" However, Zarathustra rebuffs the dwarf in the following paragraph, warning him against the spirit of gravity. Gilles Deleuze interpreted Nietzsche's Eternal Return as not simply a directive for our ethical behavior, but as a radical understanding of the nature of time. This is not a 'flat circle' or cyclical understanding of time, but a description of the empty form of future time. It is the ever-generated new time that allows us to continually act in new ways, that allows the creation of novelty.  Albert Camus  The philosopher and writer Albert Camus explores the notion of \\"eternal return\\" in his essay on \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\", in which the repetitive nature of existence comes to represent life's absurdity, something the hero seeks to withstand through manifesting what Paul Tillich called \\"The Courage to Be\\". Though the task of rolling the stone repeatedly up the hill without end is inherently meaningless, the challenge faced by Sisyphus is to refrain from despair. Hence Camus famously concludes that, \\"one must imagine Sisyphus happy.\\"  Opposing arguments and criticism  Nietzsche scholar Walter Kaufmann has described an argument originally put forward by Georg Simmel, which rebuts the claim that a finite number of states must repeat within an infinite amount of time: > Even if there were exceedingly few things in a finite space in an infinite > time, they would not have to repeat in the same configurations. Suppose > there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point > marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up > in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the > first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/œÄ of the speed of the > first, the initial line-up would never recur.Kaufmann, Walter. Nietzsche: > Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist. (Fourth Edition) Princeton University > Press, 1974. p327 Thus a system could have an infinite number of distinct physical configurations that never recur. However, the example presupposes the possibility of perfect continuity: for instance, if the universe proves to have a quantum foam nature, then the exact quantity of an irrational number cannot be expressed by any physical object.

Early life Callaghan was educated at Manchester and London universities, and he worked as a lecturer in art at St John's College, Manchester, before entering Parliament. Political career At the February 1974 general election, Callaghan was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Middleton and Prestwich. He served this constituency and its successor, Heywood and Middleton, until he retired in 1997. He was a member of several House of Commons Select Committees ‚Äì on Transport, on the Cardiff Barrage scheme, and on Education, Science & the Arts. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Joel Barnett, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He was removed from this role in March 1976, after abstaining in a division on spending cuts which the Government lost, forcing a vote of confidence against Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He later also served as PPS to the Sports Minister Denis Howell. He was a member of the Tribune Group of Labour MPs. Death Callaghan died on 29 March 2018 at the age of 91.

Versions =Terry Sloane= The Golden Age's Mister Terrific was Terry Sloane, a self-made millionaire whose photographic memory, Olympic-level athletic skills, and mastery of the martial arts made him a Renaissance man. The character first appeared in Sensation Comics #1 (January 1942). After graduating college at age 13, he eventually became a renowned business leader in the community. Having accomplished all his goals, he felt there were no challenges left for him to pursue, leading him towards suicidal tendencies. However, upon seeing a young woman jump from a bridge, Sloane reacted quickly and saved the woman, Wanda Wilson. Sloane assisted Wanda's brother, who had been caught up in a gang, by adopting a superhero identity: the Mister Terrific persona. This provided him with what he had been missing; a sense of accomplishment. He then created the \\"Fair Play Club\\" to stymie growing juvenile delinquency. He also became an active member of the Justice Society of America until the team was dissolved when the House Un-American Activities Committee ordered them to reveal their secret identities or disband. In the end, they chose the latter to protect themselves and their families from potential retribution from those they had fought in the past if their identities became known. Following the dissolution of the JSA, Mr. Terrific retired along with many of the others. Years later, Sloane came out of retirement and joined with the reformed Justice Society of America. While attending their annual meeting with the Justice League of America, he was killed by his old enemy the Spirit King, who had possessed the body of Jay Garrick to infiltrate the JLA's satellite headquarters. =Michael Holt= In 1997, the mantle of Mister Terrific was passed on to Michael Holt, an equally talented man who holds five black belts, has won the Olympic Decathlon and holds many degrees and doctorates in a wide spectrum of fields. While contemplating suicide after the accidental death of his wife and unborn child, he was met by the Spectre, who told him about Terry Sloane. Inspired by Sloane's life story, he took the name \\"Mister Terrific\\"Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 279: \\"The Spectre ongoing series was nearing its end, but that didn't stop writer John Ostrander and artist Tom Mandrake from pooling their creative forces to create one of the DCU's newest shining stars...An inspired and reborn [Michael] Holt then picked up the mantle of Mr. Terrific.\\" and later joined the current Justice Society of America, eventually serving as its chairman. He is the inventor of the T-Sphere, an artificially intelligent miniature device that he controls with his mask and earpieces. The T-Sphere can fly, create holographic images, project beams of light, release electrical charges, hack into computers and GPS satellites, and constantly cloaks Holt against detection and the recording of his image by any and all technological, non-organic means making him virtually invisible to everything but human line of sight. In the past, he has used them for reconnaissance, infiltration, espionage and information retrieval and storage, often multi-tasking his T-Spheres to all go off on different tasks at once. He can also use his T-Spheres offensively as projectiles and has stated as a threat to an opponent that he can instantly accelerate them to 14 miles per second (50,400 miles per hour) so when it hits them, it would cause a tremendous release of energy, turning around 70% of their corporeal being into super-heated plasma and liquifying the rest. Whether this has ever been tested or was just a bluff is unknown, but considering that his opponent wasn't real, much less alive, Mr. Terrific would have had no moral difficulties in using this option if it came down to it. While in costume, Mr. Terrific has no fewer than three T-Spheres orbiting his body at all times and has had as many as ten. He is also considered the third-smartest man alive. Holt served as the White King in the restructured Checkmate but eventually returned to full-time duties with the JSA. However, Holt was apparently killed in Justice Society of America #30/31 (Aug/Sept 2009), but returned to the land of the living shortly afterwards. In 2011, Holt became the title character in his own Mister Terrific comic book, as part of The New 52, but this was a short run, ending in 2012 after eight issues. He has since appeared in the DC book Earth 2 following his series's cancellation, along with the new incarnation of Terry Sloane. =Other= * In Kingdom Come, Alex Ross portrayed a Mister Terrific with oversized guns, shoulder pads, and other military accoutrements. He sported the \\"Fair Play\\" logo, but displays little idea of its true and original meanings. * Another version was portrayed in JSA: The Liberty File and its sequel JSA: The Unholy Three. Here, Terry Sloane was portrayed as a World War II intelligence agent transferred to desk duty, until the untimely death of his fiance by the story's version of the Scarecrow. He was seen wearing a variation of the classic \\"Fair Play\\" costume and using a rapier. Similar characters * In the JSA All-Stars mini-series chapter focusing on Mister Terrific, Terry's brother Ned appears at a costume ball dressed in an anti-Mister Terrific costume, calling himself Doctor Nil, in order to irritate his brother. * In Villains United #5, a new villain calling himself Mister Terrible appears as a part of Deathstroke's criminal army, wearing a variation of Holt's Mister Terrific costume. In other media =Television= Live action * Terry Sloane appears in the Smallville episode \\"Absolute Justice\\", in a painting hanging in the Justice Society of America hall. Michael Holt is mentioned in the Smallville episode \\"Absolute Justice\\" (which featured the Justice Society) in the second half by Lois Lane, who mentions that she skipped an interview with him. He is described as a Nobel-winning scientist and tech guru. * A character named Curtis Holt appears in the CW series Arrow, played by Echo Kellum. When he is first introduced, Curtis works with Felicity Smoak at Palmer Technology. Like his comic book incarnation, he has created the T-spheres and occasionally wears the Fair Play jacket. Curtis is a big fan of Green Arrow, and after learning that Felicity has a connection with him, he is determined to figure out his identity. In the episode \\"Beacon of Hope\\", Curtis joins Team Arrow temporarily and learns the members' identities, helping them to defeat the latest attack of Brie Larvan. In Season 5, Curtis officially joins Team Arrow and begins training to become a vigilante. As a vigilante, Curtis uses the name \\"Mr. Terrific\\", which is a homage to his favorite wrestling champion Terry Sloane, who went by the same name in the ring. This version of the character is gay and is depicted as having a husband named Paul (perhaps a gender-swapped version of his wife in the comics, who was named Paula). Animation * Michael Holt has made several cameo appearances in the animated TV series Justice League Unlimited. He moves into a more prominent role in the series' final season, becoming the League's Coordinator and responsible for assigning tasks to the various heroes after J'onn J'onzz resigns from active duty. The animated Mr. Terrific is voiced by former Third Watch star Michael Beach. It is unknown whether Mr. Terrific retains his invisibility to technology, as throughout the show the image of his face appears on several computer screens. His status as one of the world's smartest men is referred to in his full introductory appearance, and the T-Spheres are used in a subsequent episode. * The original Mister Terrific appears as a nonspeaking character in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!\\". * Michael Holt appears in \\"Hunted\\", the premiere episode of Beware the Batman, where he is voiced by Gary Anthony Williams. He is depicted as a businessman who is kidnapped along with Simon Stagg and Alfred Pennyworth by Professor Pyg and Mr. Toad. The three of them are rescued by Batman. * Mister Terrific appears in Justice League Action episode \\"The Cube Root\\", voiced by Hannibal Buress. This version is a former child prodigy who was the college roommate of Martin Stein. Mister Terrific was establishing the science center dedicated to him which Firestorm attends until it is crashed by Calculator who hacks into Mister Terrific's T-Spheres. During Mister Terrific and Firestorm's fight with Calculator upon him causing a blackout, Calculator uses the hacked T-Spheres to split Firestorm back into Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein where the hacked T-Spheres make off with Ronnie Raymond. This causes Mister Terrific and Martin Stein to work together to rescue Ronnie Raymond using the S-Cubes as a diversion so that Martin Stein can combine with Ronnie Raymond in order to form Firestorm. Mister Terrific and Firestorm reclaim control over the T-Spheres, defeat Calculator, and hand him over to the police. In ‚ÄúThe Brain Buster‚Äù, he is kidnapped along with other highly intelligent heroes and villains to participate in an initially unknown figure's series of contests to determine who is most intelligent. It is mentioned several times that he is ‚Äúonly‚Äù the third-smartest person in the world. In the end, he reveals that he prefers not to call too much attention to himself; he is the one who made the list, and gave himself third place. =Film= * In Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, a picture of a Parallel Earth version of Mister Terrific, named Mister Horrific, can be seen in the Joker's counterpart computer, as one of Superwoman's made men. * An alternate universe version of Michael Holt appears in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, voiced by Arif S. Kinchen. He was a scientist who was part of Lex Luthor's \\"Project Fair Play\\". While meeting with the other scientists (consisting of Will Magnus, John Henry Irons, Karen Beecher, Pat Dugan, Kimiyo Hoshi, Emil Hamilton, Thomas Morrow, and Stephen Shin), Michael Holt is killed with the other scientists, (with the exception for Will Magnus who secretly orchestrated the attack), by the Metal Men. *The Michael Holt version of Mister Terrific appears in the 2019 DC Universe Original Movie Justice League vs. the Fatal Five, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. =Video games= * Mr. Terrific makes a background cameo in the video game Injustice: Gods Among Us.

The format is open, fully documented, and can be freely used under the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement. History MusicXML was invented by Michael Good and initially developed by Recordare LLC. It derived several key concepts from existing academic formats (such as Walter Hewlett's ASCII-based MuseData and David Huron's Humdrum). It is designed for the interchange of scores, particularly between different scorewriters. MusicXML development was managed by MakeMusic following the company's acquisition of Recordare in 2011. MusicXML development was transferred to the W3C Music Notation Community Group in July 2015. Version 1.0 was released in January 2004. Version 1.1 was released in May 2005 with improved formatting support. Version 2.0 was released in June 2007 and included a standard compressed format. All of these versions were defined by a series of document type definitions (DTDs). An XML Schema Definition (XSD) implementation of Version 2.0 was released in September 2008. Version 3.0 was released in August 2011 with improved virtual instrument support, in both DTD and XSD versions. Version 3.1 was released in December 2017 with improved support for the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL). The MusicXML DTDs and XSDs are each freely redistributable under the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement. Support , MusicXML is supported to varying degrees by over 250 notation programs. These programs include: * Most scorewriting programs, including Finale, Dorico, Sibelius, and MuseScore. * Most Music OCR programs, including SmartScore, PhotoScore and Audiveris. * Most music sequencer programs, including Cubase, Logic Pro, Digital Performer, and SONAR. Additionally, web support is possible through the use of the HTML5 canvas element and JavaScript resulting in the rendering of legible music within a web browser. Source code available in Google Code, Github and Bitbucket. Features include key and time signatures, clefs, beaming information, stem directions, slurs, ornaments, barlines, and written repeats. Example Like all XML-based formats, MusicXML is intended to be easy for automated tools to parse and manipulate. Though it is possible to create MusicXML by hand, interactive score writing programs like Finale and MuseScore greatly simplify the reading, writing, and modifying of MusicXML files.

Early life Born in Winnipeg and educated at Strathcona High School and the University of Alberta, Waters commissioned into the 14th Army Tank Battalion in 1941.Canada from afar: the Daily telegraph book of Canadian obituaries By David Twiston Davies, page 237 He was then posted to the First Special Service Force. In 1943, using scaling ropes, Waters led his unit up the sheer cliffs of Monte la Difensa to attack German defences. In February 1944 he landed at Anzio and, due to Allied losses, temporarily took command of a battalion. After the war, he rose steadily through the ranks, and ended his career as a Lieutenant-General and Commander of the Canadian Forces Mobile Command (1973‚Äì75). In 1975, he joined Mannix organization at Calgary, becoming president of Loram Group, a subsidiary of the parent company. He was a co-founder of the Bowfort Group of Companies, which engage in farming, real estate and investment operations throughout Western Canada. He held a variety of executive positions until his retirement from business in 1989. Political career Stan Waters was also keenly interested in Canadian politics. In 1987, Waters became a founding member of Preston Manning's Reform Party of Canada. While Waters did not choose to participate as a Reform Party candidate in the federal election of 1988, he was seen as one of the party's most popular early spokesmen and policy communicators, speaking at numerous party rallies and events from 1987 to 1991. In 1989, under strain from the troubling and complex wrangling surrounding the Meech Lake Accord and constitutional amendment talks, Alberta Premier Don Getty called for a Senate election. Stan Waters came forward as the Reform Party of Alberta candidate for the open Alberta Senate seat. On October 16, 1989, he received 41.7% of the more than 620,000 non-binding votes cast by Albertans in his bid to go to Ottawa. Although it was a non-binding result, he was selected as the first person to be elected by a provincial population to be the Prime Minister's recommendation to the Governor General for appointment to the Senate. He represented the senate division of Alberta. Pressured by Getty and Reform, with Deborah Grey promising that if \\"we don't get this seat, we'll get 10 in the next election\\", Prime Minister Brian Mulroney agreed to advise Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn to appoint Waters to the Canadian Senate.Reforming the Senate CBC News, 30 December 2008 On June 11, 1990, Stan Waters was sworn into the Senate. He was also the first representative of the Reform Party in the Upper House. During his year-long tenure as a Senator, Waters spoke for Western Canadian and conservative values. He pushed for an end to official bilingualism, urged health care reform, opposed federal funding grants to artists and fervently pushed the Mulroney Government to adopt a \\"Triple-E Senate\\" (Elected, Effective and Equal) during the constitutional debates of 1990‚Äì91. On the abortion issue, Waters was pro-choice, which put him somewhat at odds with the Reform Party's conservative Christian supporters. Death and legacy In September 1991, Waters died at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary of complications resulting from brain cancer.Stan Waters was Canada's first senator to be elected: [City Edition] Kitchener - Waterloo Record; Kitchener, Ont. [Kitchener, Ont]26 Sep 1991: A10. When the federal Liberal Party was returned to power in the 1993 election under party leader Jean Chr√©tien, Senate reform was all but abandoned. Chr√©tien and his successor, Paul Martin, did not advise the appointment to the Senate of candidates elected by Albertans in 1998 and 2004, citing the fact that the elections are not part of the Senate selection process, as defined by the Constitution of Canada. His son Mark Waters served as leader of the Alberta Political Alliance, a minor provincial political party.  Archives  There is a Stan Waters fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

The distinguishing difference between the two forms is the maximum number of concurrent threads that can execute in any given pipeline stage in a given cycle. In temporal multithreading the number is one, while in simultaneous multithreading the number is greater than one. Some authors use the term super-threading synonymously.Superthreading with a multithreaded processor Variations There are many possible variations of temporal multithreading, but most can be classified into two sub-forms: ;Coarse-grained: The main processor pipeline contains only one thread at a time. The processor must effectively perform a rapid context switch before executing a different thread. This fast context switch is sometimes referred to as a thread switch. There may or may not be additional penalty cycles when switching. :There are many possible variations of coarse-grained temporal multithreading, mainly concerning the algorithm that determines when thread switching occurs. This algorithm may be based on one or more of many different factors, including cycle counts, cache misses, and fairness. ;Fine-grained (or interleaved): The main processor pipeline may contain multiple threads, with context switches effectively occurring between pipe stages (e.g., in the barrel processor). This form of multithreading can be more expensive than the coarse-grained forms because execution resources that span multiple pipe stages may have to deal with multiple threads. Also contributing to cost is the fact that this design cannot be optimized around the concept of a \\"background\\" thread -- any of the concurrent threads implemented by the hardware might require its state to be read or written on any cycle. Comparison to simultaneous multithreading In any of its forms, temporal multithreading is similar in many ways to simultaneous multithreading. As in the simultaneous process, the hardware must store a complete set of states per concurrent thread implemented. The hardware must also preserve the illusion that a given thread has the processor resources to itself. Fairness algorithms must be included in both types of multithreading situations to prevent one thread from dominating processor time and/or resources. Temporal multithreading has an advantage over simultaneous multithreading in that it causes lower processor heat output; however, it allows only one thread to be executed at a time.

The party formed a coalition with the Union for the Republic for the Sammarinese election of 2016 and following their electoral success, the two parties created a new party, Future Republic. History AP was born as an anti-establishment party in 1993, in parallel with the rise of Lega Nord in Italy, of which it has been long considered the Sanmarinese counterpart, but has since then become a stable political force in San Marino, participating in government coalitions with the centrist Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (PDCS) as well as with the centre-left Party of Socialists and Democrats (PSD) since 2002. In the 2006 general election the party won 12.1% of the vote and 7 out of 60 seats in the Grand and General Council, making it the third-largest party of the country. In 2008 after the breaking-up of the governing coalition, due to the rising clashes between AP and United Left, under the new electoral system, the party decided to join PDCS in the centrist Pact for San Marino coalition for the 2008 general election, gaining 11.5% of votes and 7 seats out of the 35 of the coalition gained and 11.52% of the national vote. Assunta Meloni became one of the two Joint Captains Regent of San Marino. After the political crisis of 2011, AP confirmed its alliance with PDCS, creating the new alliance San Marino Common Good, which won the 2012 general election, even though AP itself lost three seats. For the 2016 general election, AP broke its alliance with PDCS and formed the Future Republic electoral list with Union for the Republic, which was a part of the Adesso.sm coalition.

Roh first used the term in an essay in 1925, \\"Magic Realism: Post- Expressionism\\", to contrast to Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub's \\"New Objectivity\\", which more narrowly characterized these developments within German art. Though Roh saw \\"post-expressionism\\" and \\"magic realism\\" as synonymous, later critics characterized distinctions between magic realism and other artists initially identified by Hartlaub and have also pointed out other artists in Europe who had different stylistic tendencies but were working within the same trend. Background Leading up to World War I, much of the art world was under the influence of Futurism and Expressionism. Both movements abandoned any sense of order or commitment to objectivity or tradition. The sentiment of Futurists was most vocally expressed by Filippo Marinetti in the Futurist Manifesto, where he called for a rejection of the past, a rejection of all imitation -- of other artists or of the outside world -- and praised the virtue of originality and triumph of technology.Umbro Apollonio (ed.), Futurist Manifestos, MFA Publications, 2001 The Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, along these lines, said ‚ÄúAfter seeing electricity, I lost interest in nature.‚ÄùGreaves, Zaller, and Roberts 1997, p.779 Marinetti and other Futurists glorified war and violence as a way to revolution - bringing freedom, establishing new ideas, and rallying one to fight for one's own people - and as war was shaping up in Europe, many saw it and encouraged a way to ‚Äúpurify‚Äù the culture and destroy old, obsolete elements of society. Expressionists, likewise abandoning imitation nature, sought to express emotional experience, but often centered their art around angst -- inner turmoil; whether in reaction to the modern world, to alienation from society, or in the creation of personal identity. In concert with this evocation of angst, expressionists also echoed some of the same feelings of revolution as did Futurists. This is evidenced by a 1919 anthology of expressionist poetry titled Menschheitsd√§mmerung, which translates to ‚ÄúDawn of Humanity‚Äù -- meant to suggest that humanity was in a 'twilight'; that there was an imminent demise of some old way of being and beneath it the urgings of a new dawning.Midgley 2000, p.15 Both futurism and expressionism were always met by opposition, but the destruction that occurred in the war had heightened the criticism against them. Following the war, in and throughout different artistic circles there was a call for a return to order and re-appreciation of tradition and of the natural world. In Italy, this was encouraged by the magazine Valori Plastici and came together in the Novecento, a group that exhibited in the Venice Biennale and was joined by many Futurists who had rejected their former work. Mario Sironi, a member of this group, stated that they ‚Äúwould not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it.‚Äù The ‚ÄúNew Objectivity‚Äù or Neue Sachlichkeit, as coined by Hartlaub, described the developments in Germany and became the title of an exhibition that he staged in 1925. Neue Sachlichkeit was influenced not only by the ‚Äúreturn to order‚Äù but also a call to arms among more left-leaning artists who wanted to use their art in a forward, political manner that expressionism didn't enable them to do. In Belgium, there was another vein in the common trend, which would later be referred to as a ‚Äúretour √† l‚Äôhumain‚Äù. Movements When Hartlaub defined the idea of the Neue Sachlichkeit, he identified two groups: the verists, who ‚Äú[tore] the objective form of the world of contemporary facts and represent current experience in its tempo and fevered temperature,‚Äù and the classicists, who ‚Äú[searched] more for the object of timeless ability to embody the external laws of existence in the artistic sphere.‚Äù Although Roh originally meant the term 'Magic Realism' to be more or less synonymous with Neue Sachlichkeit, the artists identified by Hartlaub as 'classicists' later became associated with Roh's term. These 'Magic Realists' were all influenced by the classicism developed in Italy by the Novecento, and in turn by de Chirico's concept of metaphysical art, which had also branched into surrealism. Art critic Wieland Schmeid in 1977 posited that despite the fact that the terms were meant to refer to the same thing, the understanding of them as different groups derives from the fact that the movement had a right and left wing, with the Magic Realists on the right -- many later supporting fascism or accommodating to it-- and the verists we associate as the Neue Sachlichkeit on the left -- fighting against fascism.Crockett 1998, p.5 The two groups in addition to having different political philosophies likewise had different artistic philosophies. The third movement that is important to include in post- expressionism, and which Roh excluded, is the reaction to Flemish Expressionism, as opposed to strains of German expressionism and Italian futurism. This is typically referred to as animism. =Magic Realism= Due canarini in gabbia by Antonio Donghi, 1932 Tulpen auf der Fensterbank by Anton R√§derscheidt, 1926 'Magic Realism' for Roh, as a reaction to expressionism, meant to declare ‚Äú[that] the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.‚ÄùZamora and Ferris 1995 With the term, he was emphasizing the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of the normal world as it presents itself to us -- how, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic. In Italy, the style that Roh identified was created by a confluence of a renewed focus on harmony and technique called for by the ‚Äúreturn to order‚Äù and metaphysical art, a style which had been developed by Carlo Carr√† and Giorgio de Chirico, two members of the Novecento. Carr√† described his purpose as to explore the imagined inner life of familiar objects when represented out of their explanatory contexts: their solidity, their separateness in the space allotted to them, the secret dialogue that may take place between them. The leading painter in Italy associated with this style is perhaps Antonio Donghi, who kept to traditional subject matter -- popular life, landscapes, and still life -- but presented it with strong composition and spatial clarity to give it gravity and stillness. His still lifes often consist of a small vase of flowers, depicted with the disarming symmetry of naive art. He also often painted birds carefully arranged for display in their cages, and dogs and other animals ready to perform for circus acts, to suggest an artificial arrangement placed on top of nature. In Germany, Anton R√§derscheidt followed a style similar to Donghi, turning to magic realism after abandoning constructivism. Georg Schrimpf is somewhat like the two, working in a style influenced by primitivism. Filippo De Pisis, who is often associated with metaphysical art, can also be seen as a magic realist. Like Donghi, he often painted traditional subjects, but rather than developing a strict classical style, used a more painterly brush to bring out the intimacy of the objects, similar to the Belgian animists. His association with metaphysical art comes from the fact that he would often contrapose objects in his still lifes, and set them in a scene that gave them context. Another artist in Italy considered a magic realist is Felice Casorati, whose paintings are rendered with fine technique but often distinguished by unusual perspective effects and bold colorfulness. In 1925, Rafaello Giolli summarized the disconcerting aspects of Casorati's art ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe volumes have no weight in them, and the colors no body. Everything is fictitious: even the living lack all nervous vitality. The sun seems to be the moon ... nothing is fixed or definite.‚Äù Other German artists who worked within this style are Alexander Kanoldt and Carl Grossberg. Kanoldt painted still lifes and portraits, while Grossberg painted urban landscapes and industrial sites rendered with chilly precision. =New Objectivity and Verism= The Eclipse of the Sun by George Grosz, 1926 The artists most associated with the Neue Sachlichkeit today are those Hartlaub identified as 'verists'. These artists tended to oppose expressionism, but did not so much exemplify the ‚Äúreturn to order‚Äù as much as they opposed what they saw as the political impotence of expressionist art. They sought to involve themselves into revolutionary politics and their form of realism distorted appearances to emphasize the ugly, as they wanted to expose what they considered the ugliness of reality. The art was raw, provocative, and harshly satirical. Bertolt Brecht, a German dramatist, was an early critic of Expressionism, referring to it as constrained and superficial. Just like in politics Germany had a new parliament but lacked parliamentarians, he argued, in literature there was an expression of delight in ideas, but no new ideas, and in theater a 'will to drama', but no real drama. His early plays, Baal and Trommeln in der Nacht (Drums in the Night) express repudiations of fashionable interest in Expressionism. Opposed to the focus on individual emotional experience in expressionist art, Brecht began a collaborative method to play production, starting with his Man Equals Man project.Midgley 2000, p.16 Overall, the verist critique of expressionism was influenced by Dadaism. The early exponents of Dada had been drawn together in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war, and in common cause, they wanted to use their art as a form of moral and cultural protest -- shaking off not only the constraints of nationality, but also of artistic language, in order to express political outrage and encourage political action.Midgley 2000, p.15 Expressionism, to Dadaists, expressed all of the angst and anxieties of society, but was helpless to do anything about it. Out of this, Dada cultivated a ‚Äúsatirical hyperrealism‚Äù, as termed by Raoul Hausmann, and of which the best known examples are the graphical works and photo-montages of John Heartfield. Use of collage in these works became a compositional principle to blend reality and art, as if to suggest that to record the facts of reality was to go beyond the most simple appearances of things.Midgley 2000, p.15 This later developed into portraits and scenes by artists such as George Grosz, Otto Dix, and Rudolf Schlichter. Portraits would give emphasis to particular features or objects that were seen as distinctive aspects of the person depicted. Satirical scenes often depicted a madness behind what was happening, depicting the participants as cartoon-like. Other verist artists, like Christian Schad, depicted reality with a clinical precision, which suggested both an empirical detachment and intimate knowledge of the subject. Schad's paintings are characterized \\"an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin\\", according to Schmied.Schmied 1978, p.19 Often, psychological elements were introduced in his work, which suggested an underlying unconscious reality to life. =Animism= Bont strandzicht by Henri-Victor Wolvens, 1959. Wolvens began his style in the 1920s but worked until his death in 1977. In Belgium, expressionism had been influenced by artists like James Ensor and Louis Pevernagie who had combined expressionism with symbolism. Ensor, known for his paintings of people in masks, carnival outfits, and side-by-side with skeletons, also often painted realistic scenes, but imbued them with a fevered brush, garish colors, and strong contrasts to suggest a strange unreality present in them, as did Pevernagie. Expressionism was also exhibited in the Latemse School, where adherents like Constant Permeke and Hubert Malfait used brushwork in painting and loose form in sculpture to show a mystic reality behind nature. In what had been called a ‚Äúretour √† l‚Äôhumain‚Äù (return to the human), many artists working in Belgium after the war had kept the expressive brush of their forebearers, but had rejected what they had seen as the anti-human, unreal distortions in their subject matter. The goal was to use the expressive brush to depict the soul or spirit of the objects, people, and places they were painting, rather than a hyperbolic, externalized, displaced angst of the artist. These artists were often characterized as 'introverts', as opposed to the 'extroverts' of expressionism. Stillleben mit Kaffeekanne by Floris Jespers, 1932. Jespers was influenced by animism after the war. Belgian art critic Paul Haesaerts later gave this movement the title animism, which he took from anthropologist E.B. Tylor's book Primitive Culture (1871) describing 'animism' as primitive religion that based itself on the idea a soul inhabited all objects. Later, Haesaerts, driven by criticism to do so, also used the terms r√©alisme po√©tique and intimism, although animism is still most commonly used in literature. Intimism will more often refer to the art practiced by some members of the Nabis. The most recognized painter of these artists is Henri-Victor Wolvens, who painted many scenes of the beach and ocean at Oostende. In his beach scenes, harsh waves are painted with a rough brush, clouds in patches -- rougher when in storm -- and the sand with a scraped quality. Figures are painted as simply as possible, often as stick figures, and given translucency and movement -- so his bathers show the activity of the beach and it the activity of the bathers blend in with the motion of the waves crashing ashore. The work of Floris Jespers was strongly influenced by an animist spirit after the war. He uses form and color to give different degrees of vividness to the subjects in his paintings, each to the degree that one would associate them with in life. Other painters associated with this movement are Anne Bonnet, Albert Dasnoy, Henri Evenepoel, Mayou Iserentant, Jacques Maes, Marcel Stobbaerts, Albert Van Dyck, Louis Van Lint, War Van Overstraeten and Jozef Vinck. Filippo De Pisis, referenced above, exhibited animist tendencies. George Grard is the sculptor most associated with animism. Like expressionists, he went against both naturalism and classical tendencies, but used exaggerations from his models to heighten the feeling and sensuality of the form, and chose lyrical subjects. Grard was friends with Charles LePlae, who had a similar style, but kept more in line with natural and classical forms. Herman De Cuyper is also associated with animism, and abstracted to a more extreme degree than did Grard or LaPlae, and in some ways is more similar to Henry Moore. Counter-movements An early revolt against the imposed classicism that was popular in the Novecento took place with the founding of the Scuola Romana. =Romantic Expressionism= Corrado Cagli was a member of this group, and identified himself and others whom he met as members of the ‚ÄúNew Roman School of Painting‚Äù, or nuovi pittori romani (new Roman painters).Anticipi sulla Scuola di Roma (Anticipations on the School of Rome) on \\"Quadrante\\" (I, 1933 n.6) Cagli spoke of a spreading sensitivity and an Astro di Roma (Roman Star) which guided them, affirming it as the poetic basis of their art: Sometimes referred to as romantic expressionism, art from this group exhibits a wild painting style, expressive and disorderly, violent and with warm ochre and maroon tones. Contrary to early expressionism, the focus isn't on angst and turmoil, but rather seeing the world anew, as Cagli described, through romantic imagination. Yet, the formal rigour of the Novecento was replaced by a distinctly expressionist visionariness.Cf. Renato Barilli, L'arte contemporanea: da C√©zanne alle ultime tendenze, Feltrinelli, 2005, p.248: \\"... a savage and reductive raffiguration dominates, which recalls distant baroque trends, or even closer to the expressionist furores of artists such as Chagall, made viable to them thanks to Antonietta Rapha√´l, who had known him in Paris.\\" Scipione brought to life a sort of Roman baroque expressionism, where often decadent landscapes appear of Rome's historical baroque centre, populated by priests and cardinals, seen with a vigorously expressive and hallucinated eye. Mario Mafai painted many scenes of Rome and its suburbs, and used warm chromatic colors to convey a sense of freshness and pictorial curiosity. This bent is particularly emphasised in his 1936-1939 work, in a series paintings entitled Demolitions, where in order to make a political statement he painted urban restructuring being carried out by the fascist regime. During the Second World War he painted a series of Fantasies depicting horrors committed by the fascists.Cf. F. Negri Arnoldi, Storia dell'Arte Moderna, Milan 1990, pp.613-616 Antonietta Rapha√´l, Mafai's wife and a sculptor, was also a member of this group. Another member was Renatto Guttuso, who like Mafai made paintings which denounced the fascist regime. Guttuso's works are generally bright, lively, and verging on abstraction. Emanuele Cavalli and Giuseppe Capogrossi have associations both with the Scuola Romana and with Magic Realism.

Preparing the food for the banquet of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, Spry proposed the recipe of cold chicken, curry cream sauce and dressing that would later become known as coronation chicken. Coronation chicken may have been inspired by jubilee chicken, a dish prepared for the silver jubilee of George V in 1935, which mixed chicken with mayonnaise and curry.

It is native to Cuba. Description The bee hummingbird is the smallest living bird. Females weigh and are long, and are slightly larger than males, with an average weight of and length of . Like all hummingbirds, it is a swift, strong flier. The male has a green pileum and bright red throat, iridescent gorget with elongated lateral plumes, bluish upper parts, and the rest of the underparts mostly greyish white. The male is smaller than the female. The female is green above, whitish below, with white tips to the outer tail feathers. Compared to other small hummingbirds, which often have a slender appearance, the bee hummingbird looks rounded and plump. Female bee hummingbirds are bluish green with a pale gray underside. The tips of their tail feathers have white spots. During the mating season, males have a reddish to pink head, chin, and throat. The female lays only two eggs at a time, each about the size of a coffee bean. The brilliant, iridescent colors of the bee hummingbird's feathers make the bird seem like a tiny jewel. The iridescence is not always noticeable, but depends on the viewing angle. The bird's slender, pointed bill is adapted for probing deep into flowers. The bee hummingbird feeds mainly on nectar, and an occasional insect or spider, by moving its tongue rapidly in and out of its mouth. In the process of feeding, the bird picks up pollen on its bill and head. When it flies from flower to flower, it transfers the pollen. In this way, it plays an important role in plant reproduction. In one day, the bee hummingbird may visit 1,500 flowers.

Males in the ‚Äúbee‚Äù hummingbird clade court females with sound from tail‚Äêfeathers, which flutter during display dives. Using bits of cobwebs, bark, and lichen, the female builds a cup-shaped nest that is about in diameter. Nests have been built on single clothespins. She lines the nest with soft plant fibers.

History The party was founded in 1990 when the Social Democratic Youth League reconstituted itself as New Democracy. In the 1993 election, when the Socialist Party of Serbia lost its majority in parliament, New Democracy, which had previously belonged to the DEPOS, supported the socialists in gaining a parliamentary majority necessary to form a government, citing Milo≈°eviƒá's commitment to securing a peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1998, New Democracy left the government and was replaced by the Serbian Radical Party. In 2000, New Democracy was a part of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition, the candidate of which, Vojislav Ko≈°tunica, won the 2000 presidential elections. At the parliamentary election in the same year, the party was part of the same coalition and participated in the government which was formed by DOS. In 2003 the party was renamed Liberals of Serbia. At the parliamentary election on 28 December 2003 Liberals of Serbia put up as candidates the former Serbian Interior Minister Du≈°an Mihajloviƒá and the former Chief of Serbian Police, General Sreten Lukiƒá, the latter indicted for war crimes in the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The party won 0.7% of the popular vote and no seats. In October 2005 Mihajloviƒá stepped down and Radivoje Lazareviƒá, former Yugoslav ambassador to Brazil, took over as party president. In 2010, acting president of the party, Miroslav Stefanoviƒá, was fined 150.000 RSD for falsely accusing Vladimir Beba Popoviƒá of being responsible for the assassination of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá in 2007.

The first elections after independence will not held until 8 September 1981. At that election Dr. Tomasi Puapua, was elected as prime minister with a 7:5 majority over the group a members of parliament headed by Toaripi Lauti. The administration of Toaripi Lauti had become involved in controversy, as a result of his decision to invest nearly all of the government's money with an American real estate salesman who promised 15 percent returns from the purchase of land in Texas. The investment turned out to be a fraud. While the funds were recovered by US agencies, the controversy resulted in a loss of confidence in his judgment and was an important factor in the election of Dr. Tomasi Puapua. Toaripi Lauti also served as the President of the Funafuti Town Council and as a member of the Tuvalu Language Board. Governor-General of Tuvalu His reputation was redeemed from the circumstances that ended his time as prime minister, he was the Governor- General of Tuvalu, representing Elizabeth II, Queen of Tuvalu as head of state, from 1 October 1990 through 1 December 1993. In 1990 he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

A balisong, also known as a fan knife, butterfly knife or Batangas knife, is a folding pocketknife from the Philippines. Its distinct features are two handles counter-rotating around the tang such that, when closed, the blade is concealed within grooves in the handles. A latch holds the handles together, typically mounted on the one facing the cutting edge (the \\"bite handle\\"). The balisong was commonly used by Filipinos, especially those in the Tagalog region, as a self-defense and pocket utility knife. Hollow-ground balisongs were also used as straight razors before conventional razors were available in the Philippines. In the hands of a trained user, the knife blade can be brought to bear quickly using one hand. Manipulations, called \\"flipping\\", are performed for art or amusement. Blunt \\"trainer\\" versions of these knives are available and can be used to practice tricks without the risk of injury. The knife is now illegal or restricted in some countries, often under the same laws and for the same reasons that switchblades or concealed weapons are restricted. Within the Philippines, it is no longer as common in urban areas as in the past. Etymology The name \\"balisong\\" is derived from barangay (village) Balisong, part of the municipality of Taal, Batangas province, which along with the neighboring barangay Pandayan, were the original manufacturing centers of the knives in the Philippines. The two barangays were home to a blacksmith industry that also produced other bladed implements such as bolo knives.'The Making of the Batangas (Balisong) Knife' by Dr Jopet Laraya It is also claimed that the meaning of the term balisong is derived from the Tagalog words baling sungay (literally, \\"broken/folding horn\\") as the hilt of the blade were traditionally made from carved carabao and deer horn, as well as bones. The traditional balisong is also known as veinte y nueve, or \\"twenty- nine,\\" in the Philippines, because they are long when opened. Other names for the knives in English include \\"fan knives\\" and \\"butterfly knives\\" from the motion, and \\"click clacks\\" from the sound they make when they are opened and closed. History The origin of the knives is unclear. Oral histories claim that the knives were first created in the Philippines in 800 AD. However, there is no documentation or archeological evidence to back this. Balisong mass production in the Philippines can only be attested to the early 1900s. Another claim is that balisong were originally an adaptation of a French measuring tool called the pied du roi (\\"foot of the king\\"), invented between the 1500s to the late 1700s. However, how it was introduced to the Philippines is unknown. There are theories that it may have been introduced by sailors in the Spanish Empire, which was then allied to France. Regardless of the origin, the modern balisong was perfected in the Philippines, where it became much larger and were predominantly used as a weapon and not just a tool. The quick opening techniques (\\"flipping\\") were also developed in the Philippines. In contrast, the French pied du roi was primarily a folding ruler, with the knife only included in some specimens as a novelty. They were cumbersome to open and unlikely to be used for self-defense, especially since they also commonly included a metal tang at a right angle from the end of the handle to aid in measuring. There were also very similar designs to the balisong produced in England in the late 19th century, presumably also derived from the pied du roi. But like the latter they were primarily utilitarian tools. Construction There are two main types of balisong construction: \\"sandwich construction\\" and \\"channel construction\\". Sandwich constructed balisong knives are assembled in layers that are generally pinned or screwed together though may sometimes use a ball-bearing system. They allow the pivot pins to be adjusted more tightly without binding. When the knife is closed, the blade rests between the layers. For a channel constructed balisong, the main part of each handle is formed from one piece of material. In this handle, a groove is created (either by folding, milling, or being integrally cast) in which the blade rests when the knife is closed. This style is regarded as being stronger than sandwich construction. Some of the blades of traditional butterfly knives in the Philippines were made from steel taken from railroad tracks thus giving them a decent amount of durability and hardness, while others are made from the recycled leaf springs of vehicles. Some balisongs, such as the Benchmade 51, do not use Tang Pins. Instead, it uses \\"Zen Pins\\", which are two small pins embedded in the handles of the balisong which make contact with the bottom of the blade. A balisong with zen pins negates the problem of having the tang pin fall out (as with some cheaper models). Parts Parts of a Benchmade 42. A balisong being opened and closed. ; Bite handle: The handle that closes on the sharp edge of the blade, and will cut the user if they are holding the handle when they go to close it. It's the handle that usually has the latch on it. ; Choil: The unsharpened portion of the blade just above the kicker, that makes it easier to sharpen the blade. ; Kicker (or Kick): Area on the blade that prevents the sharp edge from touching the inside of the handle and suffering damage. This is sometimes supplanted by an additional tang pin above the pivots. ; Latch: The standard locking system, which holds the knife closed. Magnets are occasionally used instead. Also keeps it from opening up when the user doesn't want it to. ; Latch, Batangas: A latch that is attached to the bite handle. ; Latch, Manila: A latch that is attached to the safe handle. ; Latch, Spring: A latch that utilizes a spring to propel the latch open when the handles are squeezed. ; Latch gate : A block inside the channel of the handles stopping the latch from impacting the blade. ; Pivot joint: A pin about which the Tang/Blade/Handle assemblies pivot. ; Safe handle: The handle (generally the handle without the latch) that closes on the non- sharpened edge of the blade. ; Swedge: Unsharpened spine of the blade. Some balisongs are also sharpened here or on both sides with either a more traditional look or wavy edges similar to a Kris sword. ; Tang: The base of the blade where the handles are attached with pivot pins. ; Tang Pin(s): Pin meant to hold the blade away from the handle when closed to prevent dulling; and, in some cases, a second pin to keep the handles from excessively banging together while the butterfly knife is being manipulated. ; Zen Pins: Screws mounted inside the handles that collide with the kicker mounted on the tang to prevent the blade from moving around while in the open or closed position. ; Blade: The blade is the piece of steel that runs down the center of the knife that is secured by both handles when closed. One edge of the blade is sharp and will cut the user if they are not careful, especially when flipping the knife. The other edge, called the swedge, is blunt and won't cut the user. The swedge commonly impacts the user's hand when flipping. Legal status The balisong has been outlawed in several countries, mainly due to its easy utility in crimes and ability to be easily concealed. * In the Philippines, it is now generally illegal to carry one without identification or a proper permit in the streets of the capital because of their prevalent use in crime and altercations. One now needs to demonstrate the need in professional livelihood or utilitarian purpose (such as cutting grass, preparing fruit and meat, being a vendor of knives, being martial arts instructors, etc.) to be able to walk around with bladed implements in the urban areas. Another rule of thumb is that the blade of pocket knives must not exceed the length of the palm and must not be openable by one hand in order to be considered as a utility knife as opposed to a weapon (thus, Swiss Army Knives are legal). * In Australia, balisongs are generally classified as a prohibited weapon, which requires a special legitimate excuse to possess it. Australian Legal Definition: A flick knife (or other similar device) that has a blade which opens automatically by gravity or centripetal acceleration or by any pressure applied to a button, spring or device in or attached to the handle of the knife. * In Canada, although not specified by name as a prohibited weapon, the balisong knife is often considered by courts to fall under the \\"gravity knife\\" or a centripetal classification and is, therefore, prohibited, unless grandfathered in before prohibition. * In Sweden, it's illegal to carry, import or trade a balisong; legal to own and collect. * In Hungary, balisongs, switchblades and gravity knives are treated like normal knives, they are legal to possess one regardless of its length, but it's illegal to carry one that's longer than 8 cm (3.14 inches) in public. * In the United Kingdom, the balisong has been legally classified as an offensive weapon since January 1989. While they are legal to possess, carrying one in public is an offence under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. Sale, lending, hiring, giving or importing is prohibited by the Criminal Justice Act 1988, as amended by the Offensive Weapons Act 1996. Any imported are liable to be seized and prosecution may follow. An exception is made for knives of this type over 100 years old, which are classed as antiques. * In the Czech republic, balisongs, switchblades and gravity knives are treated like normal knives. * In Switzerland, balisongs are illegal to carry, give, lend, buy, or trade. * In Germany, the balisong was outlawed when the Waffengesetz (weapons law) was tightened in April 2003 in the aftermath of the Erfurt massacre. Thus buying, possessing, lending, using, carrying, crafting, altering and trading it is illegal and is punishable by up to five years imprisonment, confiscation of the knife and a fine of up to ‚Ç¨10,000. Using a butterfly knife for crime of any kind ‚Äì as is any illegal weapon ‚Äì is punishable by from 1 to 10 years imprisonment. * In Finland, balisongs are legal to be purchased, sold and possessed, and are treated just like regular knives and befall under the edged weapons law. Carrying one in public is permitted if the person carrying one can prove it is used as a tool. *In the Republic of Ireland, butterfly knives are illegal offensive weapons. * In Lithuania, balisongs among other knives are legal to possess and carry as they are not considered weapons. This excludes switchblades. * In Poland, balisongs, switchblades and gravity knives are treated like normal knives. * In Russia, balisongs are legal only if the length of the blade is not more than 90 mm. * In some parts of the United States, it is illegal to possess or carry such a knife in public. In certain jurisdictions, balisongs are categorized as a \\"gravity knife\\", \\"switchblade\\", or \\"dagger\\". ** In California, balisong/switchblade knives are legal to own, buy, sell, and transport if the length of the blade is not more than 2 inches. If the length of the blade is more than 2 inches they are illegal to buy, sell, transfer, or possess in public although it is legal to possess one if kept at home. (Penal Code section 17235 & 21510.) ** In Hawaii, it is illegal to possess, manufacture, sell, transfer, or transport any balisong/Butterfly- type knife. ** In Kansas, there were once legal restrictions on butterfly knives, however, , the Kansas Comprehensive Knife Rights Act decriminalized the carrying of all types of bladed weapons. **In Illinois, it is legal to own and carry a butterfly knife. **In Chicago it is illegal to carry concealed a knife with a blade longer than 2.5 inches. Concealed carry of a double-edged knife is prohibited. Automatic (switchblade) and gravity knives are prohibited. **In Indiana it is legal to own and carry a butterfly knife both open or concealed. ** In Kentucky, the balisong is legal for concealed and open carrying anywhere one is not otherwise prohibited from carrying a concealed deadly weapon. Kentucky's constitution and revised statutes prohibit cities and counties from enacting weapons laws and restrictions. ** In Massachusetts, the balisong is legal for concealed and open carrying so long as it does not \\"[present] an objective threat of danger to a person of reasonable and average sensibility.\\" Restrictions also apply depending on the area of the person carrying the knife (such as within a public school). ** In Michigan, the balisong is legal because it is classified as a \\"folding knife\\" ** In New Jersey the criminal law, NJSA 2C:39-1, suggests balisongs are illegal but the question of legality or illegality is an open question. ** In New Mexico, possession of a butterfly knife is illegal, because the butterfly knife is a \\"switchblade\\" within the meaning of the statute making possession of switchblades unlawful.State of New Mexico v. Riddall, 112 N.M. 78, 811 P.2d 576 (N.M. App. 1991).NMSA 1978, Section 30-7-8. ** In New York, the balisong has been determined not to be a gravity knife, and therefore not prohibited under the Penal Law [see: People v. Zuniga, 303 A.D.2d 773 (2nd Dept. 2003)] However, the law prohibiting gravity knives was found to be unconstitutional and their possession was decriminalized in 2019. ** In North Carolina, citizens are allowed to carry most pocketknives most of the time. Statute S.14-269, which prohibits the concealed carrying of any \\"bowie knife, dirk, dagger\\", or \\"other deadly weapon of like kind\\" doesn't apply to an \\"ordinary pocket knife carried in a closed position\\". ** In North Dakota, it is legal to own a balisong and carry it openly, however they are illegal to carry concealed, as they are considered to be deadly weapons. ** In Ohio, it is legal to own a balisong and carry it openly, and illegal to carry concealed, as it is considered a deadly weapon. ** in Oklahoma, the balisong is legal for open carry but is illegal to carry concealed. ** In Oregon, it is illegal to carry a concealed balisong. ** In Maine, it is legal to own sell and carry ** In Tennessee, there are no restrictions in carrying a balisong and similar knives, whether open or concealed carrying.https://hobanco.com/blogs/news/tennessee-tn-knife- laws#:~:text=Butterfly%20knives%20(also%20known%20a,ownership%20and%20carry%20of%20switchblades.

Although its voice generation is typically subtractive in much the same fashion as most analog synthesizers that preceded it, its oscillators are neither voltage nor \\"digitally controlled\\", but provided by a custom Ensoniq wavetable chip. The signal path includes analog resonant low- pass filters and an analog amplifier. The synth also features a fully functional, if crude by modern standards, 8-track MIDI sequencer that can run either its internal sounds, external MIDI equipment, or both, with a capacity of 2,400 notes (expandable via cartridges). It provides quantization, step- editing, primitive forms of copy/paste editing, and can be synchronized with external MIDI or tape-in clock. ESQ-1 can store 40 presets internally, and features a cartridge slot for additional storage capability. ESQ-M, a rackmount version of the synthesizer, was released circa 1987, with the same specifications but without the sequencer. Notably, the sound chip at the core of the synth is a brainchild of Robert Yannes, father of the popular SID chip. Voicing The ESQ-1 features eight voices with three oscillators per voice, and is fully multi-timbral. Despite eight voice polyphony, it is capable of tracking nine voices - when using eight internal sounds in the sequencer, one additional internal or cartridge sound can be controlled independently. The wave ROM contains 32 different waveforms, including standard synthesis waveforms such as sawtooth and square, but also less usual ones such as \\"piano\\", \\"voice\\", or \\"bass\\" (note that, although multi-sampled, these are still single-cycle waveforms, not true samples as such). Each oscillator can be independently volume-controlled via its dedicated digitally-controlled amplifier, and modulated. Oscillator amplifiers provide room to be overdriven, and thus produce moderate analog distortion as an additional effect on, for example, synth leads or organ sounds. ESQ-1 has three independent LFOs, and three independent envelope generators which can be programmed to modulate any number of parameters. The fourth envelope generator is hardwired to the main output amplifier though it can still be used as a modulation source for other parameters as well. The output amplifier (DCA4) also provides programmable panning for each voice. Its envelope generators allow numerical level/rate settings, and like many other synthesis parameters, allow the use of negative values. Furthermore, they can be set to track for keyboard velocity and alter the attack segment of the envelope (enabling a voice to have a soft attack when played softly or vice versa), and note position to alter envelope length (for instance, on a piano sound, having shorter notes higher up the keyboard). Its low-pass filters are analog (CEM 3379), but digitally controlled, and thus can be modulated with a significant number of sources, including LFO, envelopes, velocity, aftertouch, modulation wheel, etc. Even though the filter resonance can be driven to extreme effect, the resonance setting features only 32 steps, and the filters do not fully self-oscillate. The ESQ-1's keybed doesn't feature aftertouch, but the synthesis engine is capable of processing polyphonic aftertouch over MIDI, such as the polyphonic aftertouch implementation of the SQ-80's keyboard. Furthermore, Ensoniq ESQ-1 features amplitude modulation, oscillator sync, monophonic mode, and portamento. Voice programming Each section of the synthesizer is called to screen via a dedicated button, and settings inside each category are made by using one data slider or two +/- buttons. Settings do not influence the sound directly, but rather, changes are heard only when the next note is played. In other words, one can't use the data slider to change the filter cutoff setting as a way of producing a filter sweep, but can use any of the modulation sources to the same effect (including envelopes, the modulation wheel, modulation pedal, or external controllers over MIDI). Any modulation source can be set up to modulate any page of any given program (such as OSC1, DCA1, Filter, etc.). Voices are organized in four banks, and all presets can be overwritten by the user, and exported as banks via the tape-out port in the form of audio-encoded data, thus making it easy to store any number of user-created banks on tape or, for example, a computer. Additionally, it has a cartridge slot for voice cartridges. Commercial cartridges come with two sets of four banks of voices each, but there are also blank or rewritable cartridges. Sequencing ESQ-1 has an eight track sequencer, which can be set to use any of the internal or cartridge sounds, or alternatively set to MIDI output channel for any track separately, while still being able to control a local voice on that track as well. Mixer section provides volume control for local sounds. MIDI output sends program changes, and the sequencer records continuous controller data such as pitch and modulation wheel use. The sequencer capacity can be expanded with additional cartridges. Events can be recorded in real-time (playing the keyboard or using any of the controllers with the optional use of integrated metronome with pre-count), or step by step. Recorded data can be quantized and tracks can be merged and copied. Changes and edits can be auditioned non- destructively. The sequencer can be set to slave or master clock, via MIDI or tape, and optionally controlled for play, record and punch-in via a footswitch. Sequences of up to 999 bars can be chained to \\"songs\\", with programmable number of repetitions for each, or sequenced live, since a currently selected sequence will play only after the previous one ends. Each \\"sequence\\" can use a different tempo.

Sheet 48.3 √ó 39.1 cm. In the collection of the MOMA, New York. The New Objectivity (in ) was a movement in German art that arose during the 1920s as a reaction against expressionism. The term was coined by Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub, the director of the Kunsthalle in Mannheim, who used it as the title of an art exhibition staged in 1925 to showcase artists who were working in a post-expressionist spirit. As these artists‚Äîwho included Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Jeanne Mammen‚Äîrejected the self-involvement and romantic longings of the expressionists, Weimar intellectuals in general made a call to arms for public collaboration, engagement, and rejection of romantic idealism. Although principally describing a tendency in German painting, the term took a life of its own and came to characterize the attitude of public life in Weimar Germany as well as the art, literature, music, and architecture created to adapt to it. Rather than some goal of philosophical objectivity, it was meant to imply a turn towards practical engagement with the world‚Äîan all- business attitude, understood by Germans as intrinsically American. The movement essentially ended in 1933 with the fall of the Weimar Republic and the rise of the Nazis to power. Meaning Although \\"New Objectivity\\" has been the most common translation of \\"Neue Sachlichkeit\\", other translations have included \\"New Matter-of-factness\\", \\"New Resignation\\", \\"New Sobriety\\", and \\"New Dispassion\\". The art historian Dennis Crockett says there is no direct English translation, and breaks down the meaning in the original German: In particular, Crockett argues against the view implied by the translation of \\"New Resignation\\", which he says is a popular misunderstanding of the attitude it describes. The idea that it conveys resignation comes from the notion that the age of great socialist revolutions was over and that the left-leaning intellectuals who were living in Germany at the time wanted to adapt themselves to the social order represented in the Weimar Republic. Crockett says the art of the Neue Sachlichkeit was meant to be more forward in political action than the modes of Expressionism it was turning against: \\"The Neue Sachlichkeit is Americanism, cult of the objective, the hard fact, the predilection for functional work, professional conscientiousness, and usefulness.\\"Crockett p. 1 Background Leading up to World War I, much of the art world was under the influence of Futurism and Expressionism, both of which abandoned any sense of order or commitment to objectivity or tradition. Expressionism was in particular the dominant form of art in Germany, and it was represented in many different facets of public life‚Äîin dance, in theater, in painting, in architecture, in poetry, and in literature. Expressionists abandoned nature and sought to express emotional experience, often centering their art around inner turmoil (angst), whether in reaction to the modern world, to alienation from society, or in the creation of personal identity. In concert with this evocation of angst and unease with bourgeois life, expressionists also echoed some of the same feelings of revolution as did Futurists. This is evidenced by a 1919 anthology of expressionist poetry titled Menschheitsd√§mmerung, which translates to ‚ÄúTwilight of Humanity‚Äù‚Äîmeant to suggest that humanity was in a twilight; that there was an imminent demise of some old way of being and beneath it the urgings of a new dawning.Midgley 2000, p. 15 Critics of expressionism came from many circles. From the left, a strong critique began with Dadaism. The early exponents of Dada had been drawn together in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war, and seeing their common cause, wanted to use their art as a form of moral and cultural protest‚Äîthey saw shaking off the constraints of artistic language in the same way they saw their refusal of national boundaries. They wanted to use their art in order to express political outrage and encourage political action. Expressionism, to Dadaists, expressed all of the angst and anxieties of society, but was helpless to do anything about it. Bertolt Brecht, a German dramatist, launched another early critique of expressionism, referring to it as constrained and superficial. Just as in politics Germany had a new parliament but lacked parliamentarians, he argued, in literature there was an expression of delight in ideas, but no new ideas, and in theater a \\"will to drama\\", but no real drama. His early plays, Baal and Trommeln in der Nacht (Drums in the Night) express repudiations of fashionable interest in Expressionism. After the destruction of the war, more conservative critics gained force particularly in their critique of the style of expressionism. Throughout Europe a return to order in the arts resulted in neoclassical works by modernists such as Picasso and Stravinsky, and a turn away from abstraction by many artists, for example Matisse and Metzinger. The return to order was especially pervasive in Italy. Because of travel restrictions, German artists in 1919‚Äì22 had little knowledge of contemporary trends in French art; Henri Rousseau, who died in 1910, was the French painter whose influence was most apparent in the works of the New Objectivity. However, some of the Germans found important inspiration in the pages of the Italian magazine Valori plastici, which featured photographs of recent paintings by Italian classical realists.Crockett p. 15 Pictorial art =Verists and classicists= Hartlaub first used the term in 1923 in a letter he sent to colleagues describing an exhibition he was planning.Roh et al. 1997, p. 285 In his subsequent article, \\"Introduction to 'New Objectivity': German Painting since Expressionism\\", Hartlaub explained, The New Objectivity was composed of two tendencies which Hartlaub characterized in terms of a left and right wing: on the left were the verists, who \\"tear the objective form of the world of contemporary facts and represent current experience in its tempo and fevered temperature\\"; and on the right the classicists, who \\"search more for the object of timeless ability to embody the external laws of existence in the artistic sphere\\". The verists' vehement form of realism emphasized the ugly and sordid.Michalsky 1994, p. 20 Their art was raw, provocative, and harshly satirical. George Grosz and Otto Dix are considered the most important of the verists.Michalsky 1994, p. 27 The verists developed Dada's abandonment of any pictoral rules or artistic language into a ‚Äúsatirical hyperrealism‚Äù, as termed by Raoul Hausmann, and of which the best known examples are the graphical works and photo-montages of John Heartfield. Use of collage in these works became a compositional principle to blend reality and art, as if to suggest that to record the facts of reality was to go beyond the most simple appearances of things. This later developed into portraits and scenes by artists such as Grosz, Dix, and Rudolf Schlichter. Portraits would give emphasis to particular features or objects that were seen as distinctive aspects of the person depicted. Satirical scenes often depicted a madness behind what was happening, depicting the participants as cartoon- like. Other verists, like Christian Schad, depicted reality with a clinical precision, which suggested both an empirical detachment and intimate knowledge of the subject. Schad's paintings are characterized by \\"an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin\\", according to the art critic Wieland Schmied.Schmied 1978, p. 19 Often, psychological elements were introduced in his work, which suggested an underlying unconscious reality. Max Beckmann, who is sometimes called an expressionist although he never considered himself part of any movement,Schmied 1978, pp. 23‚Äì24 was considered by Hartlaub to be a veristSchmied 1978, p. 10 and the most important artist of Neue Sachlichkeit.Michalsky 1994, p. 147 Compared to the verists, the classicists more clearly exemplify the \\"return to order\\" that arose in the arts throughout Europe. The classicists included Georg Schrimpf, Alexander Kanoldt, Carlo Mense, Heinrich Maria Davringhausen, and Wilhelm Heise. The sources of their inspiration included 19th-century art, the Italian metaphysical painters, the artists of Novecento Italiano, and Henri Rousseau.Schmied 1978, p. 11 The classicists are best understood by Franz Roh's term Magic Realism, though Roh originally intended \\"magical realism\\" to be synonymous with the Neue Sachlichkeit as a whole.Schmied 1978, p. 9 For Roh, as a reaction to expressionism, the idea was to declare ‚Äú[that] the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.‚ÄùZamora and Faris 1995 With the term, he was emphasizing the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of the normal world as it presents itself to us‚Äîhow, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic. =Regional groups= Most of the artists of the New Objectivity did not travel widely, and stylistic tendencies were related to geography. While the classicists were based mostly in Munich, the verists worked mainly in Berlin (Grosz, Dix, Schlichter, and Schad); Dresden (Dix, Hans Grundig, Wilhelm Lachnit and others); and Karlsruhe (Karl Hubbuch, Georg Scholz, and Wilhelm Schnarrenberger). In Cologne, a constructivist group was led by Franz Wilhelm Seiwert and Heinrich Hoerle. Also from Cologne was Anton R√§derscheidt, who after a brief constructivist phase became influenced by Antonio Donghi and the metaphysical artists. Franz Radziwill, who painted ominous landscapes, lived in relative isolation in Dangast, a small coastal town.Michalski 1994, p. 153 Carl Grossberg became a painter after studying architecture in Aachen and Darmstadt and is noted for his clinical rendering of industrial technology.Michalski 1994, p. 169 =Photography= Albert Renger-Patzsch and August Sander are leading representatives of the \\"New Photography\\" movement, which brought a sharply focused, documentary quality to the photographic art where previously the self-consciously poetic had held sway.Michalski 1994, pp. 181, 188 Some other related projects as Neues Sehen, coexisted at the same moment. Karl Blossfeldt's plant photography is also often described as being a variation on New Objectivity. Architecture Panorama of the IG Farben Building from the south, demonstrating how the curved shape of the building's fa√ßade reduces the impact of its scale New Objectivity in architecture, as in painting and literature, describes German work of the transitional years of the early 1920s in the Weimar culture, as a direct reaction to the stylistic excesses of Expressionist architecture and the change in the national mood. Architects such as Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn and Hans Poelzig turned to New Objectivity's straightforward, functionally minded, matter-of-fact approach to construction, which became known in Germany as (\\"New Building\\"). The movement, flourishing in the brief period between the adoption of the Dawes plan and the rise of the Nazis, encompassed public exhibitions like the Weissenhof Estate, the massive urban planning and public housing projects of Taut and Ernst May, and the influential experiments at the Bauhaus.  Film  In film, New Objectivity reached its high point around 1929. As a cinematic style, it translated into realistic settings, straightforward camerawork and editing, a tendency to examine inanimate objects as a way to interpret characters and events, a lack of overt emotionalism, and social themes. The director most associated with the movement is Georg Wilhelm Pabst. Pabst's films of the 1920s concentrate on social issues such as abortion, prostitution, labor disputes, homosexuality, and addiction. His cool and critical 1925 Joyless Street is a landmark of the objective style. Other directors included Ern≈ë Metzner, Berthold Viertel, and Gerhard Lamprecht. Theater Bertolt Brecht, from his opposition to the focus on the individual in expressionist art, began a collaborative method to play production, starting with his Man Equals Man project.Midgley 2000, p. 16 This approach to theater-craft began to be known as \\"Brechtian'\\" and the collective of writers and actors who he worked with are known as the \\"Brechtian collective\\". Music New Objectivity in music, as in the visual arts, rejected the sentimentality of late Romanticism and the emotional agitation of expressionism. Composer Paul Hindemith may be considered both a New Objectivist and an expressionist, depending on the composition, throughout the 1920s; for example, his wind quintet ' Op. 24 No. 2 (1922) was designed as '; one may compare his operas Sancta Susanna (part of an expressionist trilogy) and ' (a parody of modern life).Albright 2004, p. 278 His music typically harkens back to baroque models and makes use of traditional forms and stable polyphonic structures, together with modern dissonance and jazz-inflected rhythms. Ernst Toch and Kurt Weill also composed New Objectivist music during the 1920s. Though known late in life for his austere interpretations of the classics, in earlier years, conductor Otto Klemperer was the most prominent to ally himself with this movement. Legacy The New Objectivity movement is usually considered to have ended at the fall of the Weimar Republic when the National Socialists under Adolf Hitler seized power in January 1933.Schmied 1978, p. 30 The Nazi authorities condemned much of the work of the New Objectivity as \\"degenerate art\\", so that works were seized and destroyed and many artists were forbidden to exhibit. A few, including Karl Hubbuch, Adolf Uzarski, and Otto Nagel, were among the artists entirely forbidden to paint. While some of the major figures of the movement went into exile, they did not carry on painting in the same manner. George Grosz emigrated to America and adopted a romantic style, and Max Beckmann's work by the time he left Germany in 1937 was, by Franz Roh's definitions, expressionism. The influence of New Objectivity outside of Germany can be seen in the work of artists like Balthus, Salvador Dal√≠ (in such early works as his Portrait of Luis Bu√±uel of 1924),Roh et al. 1997, p. 291 Auguste Herbin, Maruja Mallo, Cagnaccio di San Pietro, Grant Wood, Adamson-Eric, and Juhan Muks.

The novel is set in a medieval world where the two factions, the \\"Reds\\" and the \\"Blacks\\", struggle for supremacy through battle. Crowley has said that his first, unfinished, novel was about the Wars of the Roses, but this novel owes more to the life and wars of Edward II.  Plot  A visitor arrives in the conflict between the two factions, the \\"Reds\\" and the \\"Blacks\\". It soon becomes apparent that he (it) is only superficially human. Damaged in a skirmish between Protectors and the Just at the start, he and we spend the rest of the book finding out how and why he was made and sent. Early, Fauconred quotes their book: \\"the world is founded on a pillar which is founded on the Deep\\". This turns out to be true. Whilst a war of succession plays out, the visitor becomes secretary, then recorder; and travels to the edge of the world to meet Leviathan, an immemorial creature who built the world to shelter his sleep from the heaven stones. Meanwhile, the slow stable world which has been immortal because repeating for uncounted years begins to spiral into the unknown path of development. Reception Critics Brian W.

This leads to lower prices and/or unsold goods along with the possibility of unemployment. The demand side equivalent is underconsumption; some consider supply and demand two sides to the same coin ‚Äì excess supply is only relative to a given demand, and insufficient demand is only relative to a given supply ‚Äì and thus consider overproduction and underconsumption equivalent. Overproduction is often attributed as due to previous overinvestment ‚Äì creation of excess productive capacity, which must then either lie idle (or under capacity), which is unprofitable, or produce an excess supply.  Explanation  Overproduction is the accumulation of unsalable inventories in the hands of businesses. Overproduction is a relative measure, referring to the excess of production over consumption. The tendency for an overproduction of commodities to lead to economic collapse is specific to the capitalist economy. In previous economic formations, an abundance of production created general prosperity. However, in the capitalist economy, commodities are produced for monetary profit. This so-called profit motive, the core of the capitalist economy, creates a dynamic whereby an abundance of commodities has negative consequences. In essence, an abundance of commodities disrupts the conditions for the creation of profit. The overproduction of commodities forces businesses to reduce production in order to clear inventories. Any reduction in production implies a reduction in employment. A reduction in employment, in turn, reduces consumption. As overproduction is the excess of production above consumption, this reduction in consumption worsens the problem. This creates a \\"feed-back loop\\" or \\"vicious cycle\\", whereby excess inventories force businesses to reduce production, thereby reducing employment, which in turn reduces the demand for the excess inventories. The general reduction in the level of prices (deflation) caused by the law of supply and demand also forces businesses to reduce production as profits decline. Reduced profits render certain fields of production unprofitable. Henry George argued that there could not be any such thing as overproduction in a general sense, but only in a relative sense: > Is there, then, such a thing as overproduction? Manifestly, there cannot be, > in any general sense, until more wealth is produced than is wanted. In any > unqualified sense, over- production is preposterous, when everywhere the > struggle to get wealth is so intense; when so many must worry and strain to > get a living, and there is actual want among large classes. The manner in > which the strain of the war was borne shows how great are the forces of > production which, in normal times, go to waste; proves that what we suffer > from now is not overproduction, but underproduction. > Relative overproduction there, of course, may be. The desires for different > forms of wealth vary in intensity and in sequence, and are related one with > another. I may want both a pair of shoes and a dozen pocket-handkerchiefs, > but my desire for the shoes is first and strongest; and upon the terms on > which I can get the shoes may in large measure depend my ability to get the > handkerchiefs. So, in the aggregate demand for the different forms of > wealth, there is a similar relation. And as, under the division of labor > characteristic of the modern industrial system, nearly all production is > carried on with the view, not of consumption by the immediate producers, but > of exchange for other productions, certain commodities may be produced so > far in excess of their proper proportion to the production of other > commodities, that the whole quantity produced cannot be exchanged for enough > of those other commodities to give the usual returns to the capital and > labor engaged in bringing them to market. This disproportionate production > of some things, which is overproduction in relation to the production of > other things, is the only kind of overproduction that can take place on any > considerable scale, and the overproduction of which we hear so much is > evidently of this character.George, Henry. (1883). Over Production. The > North American Review, Vol. 137, Issue 325.  Inevitability  Karl Marx outlined the inherent tendency of capitalism towards overproduction in his seminal work, Das Kapital. According to Marx, in capitalism, improvements in technology and rising levels of productivity increase the amount of material wealth (or use values) in society while simultaneously diminishing the economic value of this wealth, thereby lowering the rate of profit‚Äîa tendency that leads to the paradox, characteristic of crises in capitalism, of \\"reserve army of labour\\" and of ‚Äúpoverty in the midst of plenty‚Äù, or more precisely, crises of overproduction in the midst of underconsumption.  Solutions  John Maynard Keynes formulated a theory of overproduction, which led him to propose government intervention to ensure effective demand. Effective demand are levels of consumption which corresponds to the level of production. If effective demand is achieved then there is no overproduction because all inventories are sold. Importantly, Keynes acknowledged that such measures could only delay and not solve overproduction.  Say's law  Say's law states that \\"The more goods [for which there is demand] that are produced, the more those goods (supply) can constitute a demand for other goods\\". Keynes summarized this \\"law\\" as asserting that \\"supply creates its own demand\\". The consumer's desire to trade causes the potential consumer to become a producer to create goods that can be exchanged for the goods of others, goods are directly or indirectly exchanged for other goods. Because goods can only be paid for by other goods, no demand can exist without prior production. Following Say's law, overproduction (in the economy as a whole, specific goods can still be overproduced) is only possible in a limited sense.

Early years Born in Savannah, Georgia, to James Habersham and Mary Bolton, he attended preparatory schools and Princeton College and became successful merchant and planter. He was married to Isabella Rae, who was the sister-in-law of Col. Samuel Elbert. They had one son, Robert Habersham. American Revolution He was a member of the council of safety and the Georgia Provincial Council in 1775 and a major of a battalion of Georgia militiamen and subsequently a colonel in the 1st Georgia Regiment of the Continental Army. He had to resign from the army after he served as Lachlan McIntosh's second in the controversial duel that killed Button Gwinnett. Political career He and his brothers, James Jr. and John, were active in Georgia politics. Some older references state that Joseph was a delegate to the Confederation Congress in 1785, but this may stem from confusion with his brother John, who was a delegate at that time.Mark Boatner, Encyclopedia of the American Revolution, 2nd ed., p. 474. Joseph Habersham's entry in the American National Biography makes no mention of service in the Confederation Congress. Joseph served as Speaker of the Georgia House in 1782 and again in 1785 and was a member of the Georgia convention in 1788 that ratified the U.S. Constitution.Frances Harrold, \\"Habersham, Joseph\\"; American National Biography Online, February 2000. He served as mayor of Savannah from 1792 to 1793 and then was appointed Postmaster General by President George Washington in 1795 and served until the beginning of Thomas Jefferson's administration in 1801. When Habersham created the office of first assistant postmaster-general in 1799, Abraham Bradley, Jr. was appointed to the office. In 1802, Bradley named one of his sons, Joseph Habersham Bradley (later a notable Washington, D.C. attorney), after his former superior. Death and legacy Habersham died in 1815. He is buried in Savannah's Colonial Park Cemetery. Habersham County in Northeast Georgia, from its creation in 1818, is named in his honor. Joseph Habersham was also a Savannah Freemason. He is recorded as a masonic member of Solomon's Lodge No. 1, F. & A. M. at Savannah, Georgia.Freemasonry and United States Government, Chapter 4, By James Davis Carter, Committee on Masonic education and service, for the Grand Lodge of Texas Solomon's Lodge No. 1, F. & A.

This automobile was manufactured by the Bourbeau et Devaux Co. of Paris from 1910 to 1925 to a design by Robert Bourbeau. Rather than scaling down existing motor-car designs, Bourbeau chose to adapt mainly motor-cycle practice for his design, giving rise to the cyclecar designation. The low and light car carried its two passengers in tandem with the passenger seated at the front, while in the rear was the person doing the steering. Single-cylinder or 10 hp V-twin engines were used. Drive was to the rear wheels through a belt which could be moved between pulleys to give a two speed transmission. The front axle was centre pivotted with suspension by a single mid mounted coil spring and the steering was by a cable and bobbin. Elliptic leaf springs were used at the rear. The method of changing gear was unusual. The rear driver had to operate a lever which slackened the belt by moving the rear axle forwards and then the passenger had to move the belt between pulleys by means of a separate lever. How the car was driven without a passenger is not explained. On later cars the levers were moved so that the driver could steer the car for himself. Before World War I, B√©d√©lia cyclecars sold very well, even in Britain. A B√©d√©lia won the 1913 Cyclecar Grand Prix held at Amiens. A Morgan came in first, Morgan enthusiasts have claimed it as a win to the present day and it was largely on publicity from this success that Morgan broke into the French market, resulting in the creation of the Darmont company and, tangentially, Sandford. Nevertheless, the second placed French car was subsequently awarded the victory. Manufacturing rights were obtained by a dealer, a Monsieur Binet in 1920 and he had an updated version of the cars made for him by Mahieux of Levallois-Perret, Seine. The body design was modified to let the driver and passengers sit and a conventional three speed gearbox was fitted. Engines of up to 990 cc were offered. Commercial The car's launch coincided with a \\"Petroleum/gasoline War\\" involving the competing commercial interests of the United States, Romania and other countries. France, having no indigenous oil supplies of its own, and the Algerian reserves not yet discovered, was particularly badly hit, and government exacerbated the challenge for the infant auto-industry with new car taxes. The light-weight Bed√©lia cyclecar's introduction was therefore timely. With the cyclecar boom over the company collapsed in 1925.

History In the 1960s, Paul Kopsch (an Ohio coroner), Daniel Turcus (a police sergeant), and Donald Ward (Kopsch's special investigator), began experimenting with special purpose handgun ammunition. Their objective was to develop a law enforcement round capable of improved penetration against hard targets, such as windshield glass and automobile doors. Conventional bullets, made primarily from lead, often become deformed and less effective after striking hard targets, especially when fired at handgun velocities. The inventors named their company \\"KTW,\\" after their initials. After some experimentation with sintered tungsten-alloy Kennertium W-10 projectiles, which were eventually abandoned due to supply and cost concerns, the inventors settled on a bullet consisting mostly of hard brass and some with a steel projectile. In testing, the comparatively hard brass bullets wore out barrels far more quickly than standard solid lead and copper- jacketed lead rounds, since they did not deform to fit the rifling. In an attempt to reduce barrel wear, the steel projectiles had a copper cup which made contact with the rifling, on brass projectiles, brass driving bands are present to engage the rifling. Early KTWs were coated with Teflon. The inventors, having also noted that the tips of canes were frequently covered with the relatively soft and malleable Teflon to help them grip surfaces, found that the addition of Teflon helped to prevent bullet deflections from vehicle doors and windshields, further improving penetration against those surfaces. In the late 1960s, KTW begun commercial production. In 1980, continued production of the ammunition was turned over to the North American Ordnance Corporation. The production of KTW-branded ammunition eventually ceased in the 1990s. However, some manufacturers continue to coat their bullets with various compounds, notably Teflon and molybdenum disulfide, as a protective layer against barrel wear. Not a lot of performance data is available for these bullets, although the 9mm offering was reputed to push a 100 grain projectile at a velocity of 1350 feet per second (fps). Controversy In 1982, NBC ran a television special on the bullets, wherein it was argued that the bullets were a threat to police. Various gun control organizations in the U.S. labeled Teflon-coated bullets with the epithet \\"cop killers\\" because of the supposedly increased penetration the bullets offered against ballistic vests, a staple of the American police uniform. Many erroneously focused on the Teflon coating as the source of the bullets' supposedly increased penetration, rather than the hardness of the metals used and the sharp conical projectile design. Woven ballistic vests, like Kevlar, rely on the dense weave of the textile and the tensile strength of the fiber to create resistance (or drag) on the exterior of the projectile slowing and eventually stopping the bullet before it penetrates all of the fabric layers of a vest. The idea that Teflon coating would increase penetration was drawn from the fact that Teflon is a very good lubricant. The lubricant would retard the effectiveness of the Kevlar fabric to slow the bullet and \\"catch\\" it. A common resulting misconception, often perpetuated in film (e.g., Ronin, 1998) and television, is that coating otherwise normal bullets with Teflon will give them armor-piercing capabilities. In reality, as noted above, Teflon and similar coatings were used primarily as a means to protect the gun barrel from the hardened brass bullet, and, secondarily, to reduce ricocheting off hard, angled surfaces. The coating itself did not add any armor-piercing abilities to bullets under normal circumstances. Several of the various calibers of KTW rounds produced could, in fact, penetrate police vests, under certain conditions. However, as Kopsch pointed out in a 1990 interview; \\"adding a Teflon coating to the round added 20% penetration power on metal and glass. Critics kept complaining about Teflon's ability to penetrate body armor... In fact, Teflon cut down on the round's ability to cut through the nylon or Kevlar of body armor.\\" Legal status = United States = The federal ban on armor-piercing pistol ammunition uses only the composition of the bullet's core to determine legality. However, many individual states have legislation restricting various kinds of coating materials.

Background  In 1805, the United Kingdom, the Austrian Empire, Sweden, and the Russian Empire formed the Third Coalition to overthrow the French Empire. When Bavaria sided with Napoleon, the Austrians, 72,000 strong under Mack, prematurely invaded while the Russians were still marching through Poland. The Austrians expected the main battles of the war to take place in northern Italy, not Germany, and intended only to protect the Alps from French forces. A popular but apocryphal legend has it that the Austrians used the Gregorian calendar, the Russians were still using the Julian calendar. This meant that their dates did not correspond, and the Austrians were brought into conflict with the French before the Russians could come into line. This simple but implausible explanation for the Russian army being far behind the Austrian is dismissed by scholar Frederick Kagan as \\"a bizarre myth\\".http://dcjack.org/kagan%20on%20ulm.html Napoleon had 177,000 troops of the Grande Arm√©e at Boulogne, ready to invade England. They marched south on 27 August and by 24 September were ready to cross the Rhine from Mannheim to Strasbourg. After crossing the Rhine, the greater part of the French army made a gigantic right wheel so that its corps reached the Danube simultaneously, facing south. On 7 October, Mack learned that Napoleon planned to cross the Danube and march around his right flank so as to cut him off from the Russians who were marching via Vienna. He accordingly changed front, placing his left at Ulm and his right at Rain, but the French went on and crossed the Danube at Neuburg, Donauw√∂rth, and Ingolstadt. Unable to stop the French avalanche, Michael von Kienmayer's Austrian corps abandoned its positions along the river and fled to Munich. II Corps in Augsburg. On 8 October, Franz Auffenberg's division was cut to pieces by Joachim Murat's Cavalry Corps and Jean Lannes' V Corps at the Battle of Wertingen. The following day, Mack attempted to cross the Danube and move north. He was defeated in the Battle of G√ºnzburg by Jean- Pierre Firmin Malher's division of Michel Ney's VI Corps which was still operating on the north bank. During the action, the French seized a bridgehead on the south bank. After first withdrawing to Ulm, Mack tried to break out to the north. His army was blocked by Pierre Dupont de l'Etang's VI Corps division and some cavalry in the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on 11 October. By the 11th, Napoleon's corps were spread out in a wide net to snare Mack's army. Nicolas Soult's IV Corps reached Landsberg am Lech and turned east to cut off Mack from Tyrol. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's I Corps and Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps converged on Munich. Auguste Marmont's II Corps was at Augsburg. Murat, Ney, Lannes, and the Imperial Guard began closing in on Ulm. Mack ordered the corps of Franz von Werneck to march northeast, while Johann Sigismund Riesch covered its right flank at Elchingen. The Austrian commander sent Franz Jellacic's corps south toward Tyrol and held the remainder of his army at Ulm.  Battle  Mack surrenders to Napoleon at Ulm by Paul-√âmile Boutigny On 14 October, Ney crushed Riesch's small corps at the Battle of Elchingen and chased its survivors back into Ulm. Murat detected Werneck's force and raced in pursuit with his cavalry. Over the next few days, Werneck's corps was overwhelmed in a series of actions at Langenau, Herbrechtingen, N√∂rdlingen, and Neresheim. On 18 October, he surrendered the remainder of his troops. Only Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and a few other generals escaped to Bohemia with about 1,200 cavalry. Meanwhile, Soult secured the surrender of 4,600 Austrians at Memmingen and swung north to box in Mack from the south. Jellacic slipped past Soult and escaped to the south only to be hunted down and captured in the Capitulation of Dornbirn in mid-November by Pierre Augereau's late-arriving VII Corps. By 16 October, Napoleon had surrounded Mack's entire army at Ulm, and three days later Mack surrendered with 25,000 men, 18 generals, 65 guns, and 40 standards. Some 20,000 escaped, 10,000 were killed or wounded, and the rest made prisoner. About 500 French were killed and 1,000 wounded, a low number for such a decisive battle. In less than 15 days the Grande Arm√©e neutralized 60,000 Austrians and 30 generals. At the surrender (known as the Convention of Ulm), Mack offered his sword and presented himself to Napoleon as \\"the unfortunate General Mack\\".Blond, G. La Grande Arm√©e. Castle Books, 1979. pg.59. Mack was court- martialed and sentenced to two years' imprisonment.  Aftermath  Napoleon I saluting the wounded Austrians. The Ulm Campaign is considered one of the finest examples of a strategic victory. The campaign was won with no major battle. The Austrians fell into the same trap Napoleon had set at the Battle of Marengo, but with greater success. Everything was made to confuse the enemy. In his proclamation in the Bulletin de la Grande Arm√©e of 21 October 1805 Napoleon said, \\"Soldiers of the Grande Arm√©e, I announced you a great battle. But thanks to the bad combinations of the enemy, I obtained the same success with no risk ... In 15 days we have won a campaign.\\" By defeating the Austrian army, Napoleon secured his conquest of Vienna, which was to be taken one month later. Like the Battle of Austerlitz, the Ulm Campaign is still taught in military schools worldwide. The Ulm Campaign September‚ÄìOctober 1805.

It offers an integrated graphical interface and input generator; a large selection of functionals and correlation methods, including methods for electronically excited states and open-shell systems; solvation models; and wave-function analysis tools. In addition to serving the computational chemistry community, Q-Chem also provides a versatile code development platform. History Q-Chem software is maintained and distributed by Q-Chem, Inc., located in Pleasanton, California, USA. It was founded in 1993 as a result of disagreements within the Gaussian company that led to the departure (and subsequent \\"banning\\") of John Pople and a number of his students and postdocs (see Gaussian License ControversyBanned By Gaussian). The first lines of the Q-Chem code were written by Peter Gill, at that time a postdoc of Pople, during a winter vacation (December 1992) in Australia. Gill was soon joined by Benny Johnson (a Pople graduate student) and Carlos Gonzalez (another Pople postdoc), but the latter left the company shortly thereafter. In mid-1993, Martin Head-Gordon, formerly a Pople student, but at that time on the Berkeley tenure track, joined the growing team of academic developers. Postcard advertising the release of Q-Chem 1.0. In preparation for the first commercial release, the company hired Eugene Fleischmann as marketing director and acquired its URL www.q-chem.com in January 1997. The first commercial product, Q-Chem 1.0, was released in March 1997. Advertising postcards celebrated the release with the proud headline, \\"Problems which were once impossible are now routine\\"; however, version 1.0 had many shortcomings, and a wit once remarked that the words \\"impossible\\" and \\"routine\\" should probably be interchanged! However, vigorous code development continued, and by the following year Q-Chem 1.1 was able to offer most of the basic quantum chemical functionality as well as a growing list of features (the continuous fast multipole method, J-matrix engine, COLD PRISM for integrals, and G96 density functional, for example) that were not available in any other package. Following a setback when Johnson left, the company became more decentralized, establishing and cultivating relationships with an ever- increasing circle of research groups in universities around the world. In 1998, Fritz Schaefer accepted an invitation to join the Board of Directors and, early in 1999, as soon as his non-compete agreement with Gaussian had expired, John Pople joined as both a Director and code developer. In 2000, Q-Chem established a collaboration with Wavefunction Inc., which led to the incorporation of Q-Chem as the ab initio engine in all subsequent versions of the Spartan package. The Q-Chem Board was expanded in March 2003 with the addition of Anna Krylov and Jing Kong. In 2012, John Herbert joined the Board and Fritz Schaefer became a Member Emeritus. In 2018, Evgeny Epifanovsky was named Chief Operations Officer. The following year, Shirin Faraji joined the Board; Peter Gill, who had been President of Q-Chem since 1988, stepped down; and Anna Krylov became the new president. The active Board of Directors currently consists of Faraji, Gill (past-President), Herbert, Krylov (President), and Hilary Pople (John's daughter). Martin Head-Gordon remains a Scientific Advisor to the Board. Currently, there are thousands of Q-Chem licenses in use, and Q-Chem's user base is expanding, as illustrated by citation records for releases 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0, which reached 400 per year in 2016 (see Figure 2). Fig. 2. Citations to Q-Chem: 2001 to 2019. As part of the IBM World Community Grid, about 350,000 Q-Chem calculations are performed every day by the Harvard Clean Energy Project, which is powered by Q-Chem. Figure 3.

Bottom chart: Growth of developer base, showing existing and new developers each month. A steady growth of the developer base can be seen. The inset depicts the total number of commits by the 50 most- prolific developers, showing contributions by full-time team (> 2000 commits), the core developer team (500‚Äì2000 commits), and non-core developers (< 500 commits). Innovative algorithms and new approaches to electronic structure have been enabling cutting-edge scientific discoveries. This transition, from in-house code to major electronic structure engine, has become possible due to contributions from numerous scientific collaborators; the Q-Chem business model encourages broad developer participation. Q-Chem defines its genre as open-teamware: its source code is open to a large group of developers. In addition, some Q-Chem modules are distributed as open source. Since 1992, over 400 man- (and woman-) years have been devoted to code development. Q-Chem 5.2.2, released in December 2019, consists of 7.5 million lines of code, which includes contributions by more than 300 active developers (current estimate is 312). See Figure 3. Features Q-Chem can perform a number of general quantum chemistry calculations, such as Hartree‚ÄìFock, density functional theory (DFT) including time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset perturbation theory (MP2), coupled cluster (CC), equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM- CC), configuration interaction (CI), algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC), and other advanced electronic structure methods. Q-Chem also includes QM/MM functionality. Q-Chem 4.0 and higher releases come with the graphical user interface, IQMol, which includes a hierarchical input generator, a molecular builder, and general visualization capabilities (MOs, densities, molecular vibrations, reaction pathways, etc.). IQMol is developed by Andrew Gilbert (in coordination with Q-Chem) and is distributed as free open-source software. IQmol is written using the Qt libraries, enabling it to run on a range of platforms, including OS X, Widows, and Linux. It provides an intuitive environment to set up, run, and analyze Q-Chem calculations. It can also read and display a variety of file formats, including the widely available formatted checkpoint format. A complete, up-to-date list of features is published on the Q-Chem website and in the user manual. In addition, Q-Chem is interfaced with WebMO and is used as the computing engine in Spartan, or as a back-end to CHARMM, GROMACS, and ChemShell. Other popular visualization programs such as Jmol and Molden can also be used. In 2018, Q-Chem established a partnership with BrianQC, produced by StreamNovation, Ltd., a new integral engine exploiting the computational power of GPUs. The BrianQC plug-in speeds up Q-Chem calculations by taking advantage of GPUs on mixed architectures, which is highly efficient for simulating large molecules and extended systems.

The French engaged only some of their forces, around 33,000 men, but Archduke Charles engaged the bulk of his army, 49,000 men, leaving out Paul Davidovich's corps to defend the lower Adige and Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg's corps to cover the Austrian right against any flanking maneuvers. The fighting took place at Caldiero, 15 kilometres east of Verona, during the War of the Third Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Preliminaries By mid October, Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na, a seasoned French general, who had fought the Austrians in Lombardia before during the campaign of 1796‚Äì1797, was waiting for developments on the main theatre of operations in Bavaria.Pigeard, 171 On 18 October, Mass√©na won a bridgehead on the east bank of the Adige River in the Battle of Verona. At dawn, the French launched their attack from Verona against Josef Philipp Vukassovich's division. After heavy fighting, the divisions of Guillaume Philibert Duhesme and Gaspard Am√©d√©e Gardanne cleared the town of San Giorgio and part of the heights of Veronetta. The French lost 77 dead and 246 wounded, while the Austrians suffered 246 killed and 906 wounded. Archduke Charles was so unhappy with Vukassovich's performance that he replaced him with Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg.Schneid, 27‚Äì28 News that Emperor Napoleon I demolished the main Austrian army in the Ulm Campaign finally reached Mass√©na on 28 October and he issued orders for an immediate offensive against the Austrian army in northern Italy. Crossing the Adige river with the divisions of Duhesme, Gardanne, and Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor and leaving behind Jean Mathieu Seras' division to cover Verona, Mass√©na planned to move forward into Austrian-controlled territory. The fighting on 29 October is considered by one historian to be part of the Battle of Caldiero.Smith, 209. Smith writes that the battle lasted from 29 to 31 October. On that day, the divisions of Duhesme and Gardanne advanced on the left against Rosenberg, while Molitor's and Louis Partouneaux's divisions moved forward against the town of Veronetta. Seeing a mass of French troops approaching, the Austrians abandoned Veronetta and fell back to San Michele. The French mauled Rosenberg's division and forced Johann Maria Philipp Frimont out of San Michele after street fighting. By the end of the day, Mass√©na's troops closed up to the main defense line of Archduke Charles. The French counted losses of 527 killed and wounded, plus 157 captured. Again, Austrian casualties were heavier, numbering 1,926 killed and wounded, with 1,114 prisoners.Schneid, 30 Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen, himself acutely aware of the dire consequences of the fall of Ulm, was planning to move towards Vienna, in order to reinforce the remains of the Austrian army and link up with the Russians. However, in order to avoid having Mass√©na's men on his heels, he decided to suddenly turn and face the French, hoping that by defeating them he would ensure the success of his march towards inner Austria.Fierro, Palluel-Guillard, Tulard, 580‚Äì581 Battle plans Andr√© Mass√©na Archduke Charles had already made preparations for a French attack, occupying the strategic village of Caldiero, through which passed the main Lombardian road ('the Verona road') and deploying no less than 58 cannons and 24 mortars. The Austrian forces were divided into three main groups: to the right, Joseph Anton von Simbschen occupied the heights of Colognola and the ravine of San Zeno, where his cavalry was massed; in the centre, General Count Heinrich von Bellegarde covered the Verona road, holding the entrenchments north of the road as well as Monte Rocca and Ponterotta, to the south of the road; the left was formed by Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen's forces, which extended the Austrian line to Chiavighette and had the detached division of General Joseph Armand von Nordmann cover the Adige in front of Chiavica del Christo. Upon reconnoitering the Austrian position, Mass√©na drew up his plan. General Gardanne was to form the apex of the army, deploying his forces on both sides of the Verona road, supported by Partouneaux's reserve, Jean Louis Brigitte Espagne's cavalry and a part of Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet's dragoons. To the left Molitor's division would deploy close to Ca dell'Ara and would set out to take the heights of Colognola. To the right, Duhesme would march on Gombione in order to fall upon Caldiero, but he was ordered to make his move towards midday. Finally Jean-Antoine Verdier would cross the Adige at Perzacco and turn the enemy left, with the support of Charles Joseph de Pully's cavalry while the rest of Mermet's cavalry would ensure contact with Verdier. Battle Archduke Charles Mass√©na was planning to wait for Verdier's flanking maneuver before committing to a frontal attack, but Archduke Charles took the initiative, attacking on both flanks of the French army. Taking with him the cavalry he had available, Simbschen made the first move against Molitor, descending the slope of the Colognola heights and approaching Ca dell'Ara. On the other side of the battlefield, Nordmann moved forward too, following the river line of the Adige. Molitor moved forward himself and his forces clashed with Simbschen's, forcing the latter back up the slopes of the Colognola Alta. Just as the French were coming up the slope in order to assault that position, the Austrians were reinforced by troops sent by Bellegarde and thus could repulse the French attack, pushing them into the ravine. A second French assault would also fail and the fighting would continue throughout much of the day, with the Austrians remaining masters of the heights. Map of the Battle of Caldiero, 29‚Äì31 October 1805 In the centre, general Gardanne belatedly formed his men and painstakingly fought his way up towards Caldiero against a determined Bellegarde. Gardanne's first attempt failed and he was forced to fall back on Rotta, where he was immediately reinforced by Partounneaux and d'Espagne. With his force thus augmented, Gardanne moved forward again and this time the French managed to take the vital position of Caldiero. A furious Austrian counterattack regained the position only to see Gardanne receive further reinforcements, one of Duhesme's brigades, which helped retake Caldiero. Bellegarde reformed his men for another counterattack, which he led in cooperation with Reuss-Plauen's forces, which had just come up as reinforcements. It took a considerable effort from the combined forces of Bellegarde and Reuss-Plauen to drive the French out of Caldiero, but Gardanne sounded the charge and regained control of the village after fierce hand-to-hand combat. The Austrians finally evacuated the position and the exhausted French drove them out and then fell back to the relative safety of the village. On the French right, general Duhesme moved early against the forces of prince Reuss-Plauen and moved his first brigade under Fran√ßois Goullus against the Austrians at Gombione. However, Duhesme saw the situation on his left rapidly deteriorating and was thus forced to send Mathieu Herbin's brigade in support of Gardanne's assault of Caldiero. While Herbin's brigade would be in the thick of the fighting until nightfall, Goullus' would spend the day covering the position at Gombione.Pigeard, 171‚Äì172 To the extreme right, Verdier was operating the flanking maneuver as ordered, when he learned that Davidovich had crossed the Adige at Bonavigo and was on the right bank with a part of his troops. Verdier promptly abandoned his initial plan of crossing at Perzacco and instead decided to cross the river right away at Zevio. However, instead of striking at the back of Nordmann's force, as he had hoped Verdier found himself facing the bulk of Nordmann's troops, which soon forced the French back across the river. As night fell, combat ceased, with the Austrians already disengaged in most sectors of the battlefield. Archduke Charles decided against renewing battle the next day and began pulling out during the night. Casualties Prince Reuss Both sides took heavy casualties, with the French losing only slightly fewer men than the Austrians, around 3,700 to 4,200. The French also lost colonel Julliac de Manelle of the 2nd Foot Artillery Regiment, who was mortally wounded during the battle. Some vicious fighting involved the French 5th Line Infantry Regiment, which almost lost two of its eagles. A second source gives Austrian losses as 5,700 and notes that Charles claimed to have inflicted 8,000 casualties on the French.Smith, 209‚Äì210 A third source puts Austrian losses higher than 5,500 and says that the French under-reported their casualties as 2,000 when they must have been at least 5,000.Schneid, 39 On 30 October, as a result of the defeat at Caldiero, the Austrians also lost a further 5,000 men and 70 officers (among which there were three superior officers) with their weapons and effects. These men were stationed at Cara Albertini under the command of General Hillinger and were forced to surrender. Although the French had agreed to release the prisoners, the 5,000 men would not be released. Two authorities put Hillinger's disaster on 2 November and gave Austrian losses as 400 killed and wounded and 1,800 captured.Rothenberg, 94Smith, 210. Smith differed from Rothenberg only in giving 400 killed and listing no wounded, but this may be a misprint. Another source gives no casualties or date for the action but wrote that Hillinger was \\"annihilated\\".Schneid, 40 Strategic aftermath Archduke Charles began his retreat on the morning of 1 November, leaving a rearguard under Frimont to delay the French. Frimont's mixed brigade, consisting of four battalions and 12 squadrons, was only lightly engaged in the battle. Reinforced by infantry and an additional cavalry regiment, the rear guard put up a lively fight when pressed by d'Espagne's cavalry and the 22nd Light Infantry Regiment. Italy and Inner Austria Campaign Map 1805 Bellegarde, Rosenberg, and Reuss fell back to Vicenza while Davidovich's corps withdrew to Padua. Hoping to create trouble in Massena's rear, Charles ordered Davidiovich to reinforce the Venice garrison with 12 battalions. Unknown to Charles, Laurent de Gouvion Saint- Cyr's 8,700-man Italian division was marching northeast from central Italy. When it arrived near Venice, Saint-Cyr had sufficient strength to blockade the port and prevent the Austrian garrison from harassing Massena's communications.Schneid, 41 Archduke Charles steadily retreated, fighting a rear guard action at San Pietro in Gu near the Brenta River on 4 November in which one battalion of the Kreutzer Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 5 was destroyed by Molitor's division.Smith, 211‚Äì212 Another clash occurred at Valvasone, east of the Tagliamento River on 11 November, where Charles fended off the French pursuit.Smith, 213‚Äì214 During the withdrawal, d'Espagne trailed the Austrians with his own light cavalry division, Antoine Digonet's brigade of Verdier's division, Seras' infantry division, and Pully's cuirassiers. D'Espagne managed the pursuit effectively, making Charles believe that he was being closely followed. In fact, Mass√©na's main body was a three-day march behind the Austrians. Charles crossed the Isonzo River on 13 November. Karl von Vincent held off Molitor's attempt to cross the Isonzo River at Gradisca d'Isonzo on 16 November.Smith, 214 At the beginning of the war, Archduke John of Austria was assigned to command the army in the Tyrol and the Vorarlberg. He was directed to detach forces under Franz Jellacic and Franz Xavier von Auffenberg to the Danube army. Auffenberg's division was mauled at the Battle of Wertingen and later surrendered at the Battle of Ulm. Jellacic was required to guard the south flank of the Danube army near Lake Constance. Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps ran him to earth in the Vorarlberg. Jellacic surrendered with his infantry on 14 November in the Capitulation of Dornbirn, his cavalry having gotten away. Another brigade of the Tyrol army under Prince Louis Victor Rohan-Gu√©m√©n√© became separated in the retreat and slipped away to the south where it made a dash for Venice.Rothenberg, 99 On 24 November Rohan's 4,400 troops were caught between the divisions of Jean Reynier and Saint-Cyr at the Battle of Castelfranco Veneto and forced to surrender.Smith, 215 John managed to escape to the east with about 20,000 soldiers and fought a successful rear guard action against Nicolas Bernard Guiot de Lacour's dragoons near the upper Isonzo at Bovec on 19 November 1805. Charles hoped to march northeast to Villach for an early junction with his brother, Archduke John. However, he heard that some of Napoleon's troops were moving in his direction from the Danube valley.Schneid, 41‚Äì42 Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps was repulsed at Scharnitz on 4 November with 800 casualties. However, that day, another brigade broke through a pass farther west at Leutasch, capturing about 600 Austrian line infantry.Smith, 211 At Weyer on 7 November, Auguste Marmont's II Corps overtook and captured two battalions belonging to Maximilian, Count of Merveldt's corps. Farther east on the following day, Louis Davout's III Corps advance guard crushed Merveldt's column at the Battle of Mariazell.Smith, 212 Ney occupied Innsbruck on 7 November and Marmont was heading for Leoben in Styria. Armed with this new information, Charles instead directed his troops' march on a more easterly path toward Ljubljana (Laibach). Massena suspended his pursuit of Charles on 16 November. Archdukes Charles and John joined forces near Maribor (Marburg an der Drau) on 26 November. Though he now had an army numbering 85,000, Charles elected not to make a thrust at Vienna by attacking Marmont. Instead, he \\"moved rather slowly\\" according to historian Gunther E. Rothenberg. Charles pitched camp on the Mur River until 2 December when he withdrew into Hungary. By the time he reached K√∂rmend on 6 December, the Battle of Austerlitz had been fought, ending in a decisive French victory. Even after his great victory, Emperor Napoleon considered Archduke Charles' large army a threat. Accordingly, he directed Massena to reorganize his army as the VIII Corps, sweep east, and send Mermet's and Pully's heavy cavalry to Graz. Marmont massed at Graz with the II Corps while Ney reached Klagenfurt with his VI Corps. Napoleon stationed Marshal Davout's III Corps at Bratislava (Pressburg) and Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps south of Vienna. Charles' army was completely boxed in. On 26 December, the Treaty of Pressburg was signed, ending the conflict.Schneid, pp 42‚Äì43 Commentary The battle was thus a significant strategical victory for the French because it allowed them to closely follow the Austrian army and to harassing it continually in a number of skirmishes, as it fell back towards inner Austria. Mass√©na thus delayed Charles and prevent him from joining the army of the Danube, which would greatly influence the outcome of the war. Historians disagree on whether Caldiero was a French tactical victory, an Austrian tactical victory or a draw. Alain Pigeard, whose work is a major source for this article, rated the engagement as a French victory. Digby Smith called the battle a \\"drawn match\\",Smith, 210 but Frederick C. Schneid called it \\"indecisive\\". Gunther E. Rothenberg wrote that Caldiero was \\"Austria's solitary military success in this war\\", but he was aware that the French historian Adolphe Thiers had considered the battle to be a French victory.Thiers, vol.

Courtney Whitmore, stepdaughter of Pat Dugan, finds the original Star-Spangled Kid's gear in her stepfather's belongings. She dons the costume to annoy Dugan, as she resents his marrying her mother and moving the family from Los Angeles to Blue Valley, Nebraska. Dugan, a skilled mechanic, designs and builds S.T.R.I.P.E., a robotic suit that he uses to accompany and protect her. During her time in Blue Valley, her frequent nemesis is the young villainess known as Shiv, daughter of the immortal Dragon King.Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. #4-12. DC Comics. Their most recent rematch was in Infinite Crisis, on a page added to the hardcover edition. =Stargirl= Courtney joins the Justice Society of America. After being given Starman Jack Knight's cosmic staff, she changes her identity to Stargirl. Courtney appears in most issues of JSA and it is in these pages that her half-sister Patricia Dugan is born. Starman and Stargirl on the cover of JSA: All Stars #4 (Oct. 2003); art by John Cassaday. Later, she confronts her predecessor's killer, Solomon Grundy. Driven further into madness by the Joker's chemical assault, Grundy attacks the JSA headquarters with the head of the Statue of Liberty. With the aid of Jakeem Thunder, Courtney fights Grundy in the streets and into the sewers below. The young heroes barely defeat Grundy and Johnny Thunderbolt repairs the Statue. Grundy later develops an obsession with Courtney. Courtney encounters Merry Pemberton, the sister of the original Star-Spangled Kid, during the \\"Sins of Youth\\" storyline. Merry's concerns about her brother's legacy and about young superheroes battling adults causes friction with Courtney. They resolve their differences during a battle against the forces of Klarion the Witch Boy. Courtney later saves Merry's life during an attack by Amazo. During this incident, Courtney is magically aged to an adult by Klarion. Later, she discovers her biological father Sam Kurtis working as a common thug for an incarnation of the Royal Flush Gang. They later confront each other during one of the Flush Gang's robberies. In Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. and an issue of Impulse, Courtney hints at having a crush on Robin (Tim Drake), a concept that was not developed in subsequent issues. Courtney briefly dates fellow JSA member Captain Marvel, who, in his secret identity of Billy Batson, is the same age as she.JSA #48. In this issue, Stargirl meets a temporarily powerless Billy Batson, and each learns that the other is sixteen years old. To outsiders, however, Captain Marvel is by all appearances an adult, and the relationship between Marvel and Stargirl draws criticism from Jakeem Thunder and Jay Garrick. After Garrick confronts them, Marvel leaves the JSA and Courtney, instead of revealing his secret to the team. Marvel later returns to the JSA and explains that the Wisdom of Solomon prevents him from revealing his secret identity. A glimpse into the future shows an adult \\"Starwoman\\" married to Albert Rothstein, the JSA member known as Atom Smasher. JSA/JSA and Black Vengeance Courtney's family is murdered by agents of Per Degaton and she travels with the rest of the JSA to 1951. The Modern Age successors to Golden Age JSA members meet and fight alongside the originals to save her family and the future. She finds herself forced to work with Atom Smasher again, for the first time since he defected to Black Adam's rival team. During her trip to the past, Courtney is briefly stuck in an asylum when she tries to recruit Ted Knight. Knight had become clinically depressed for his perceived role in the creation of the atomic bomb to the point that he initially thought Courtney was a hallucination, but she was saved by a figure later identified as Starwoman, an adult version of her infant sister Patricia. After the crisis is over, Courtney forgives Al for his past alliance with Black Adam but Atom Smasher is nearly killed by the Spectre during an attack on Khandaq. He survives, but the event reveals the depth of Courtney's feelings for him. She returns to her own time to find her family alive again. Later, Atom Smasher is tried and convicted for his actions while working for Black Adam. During a TV appearance, Courtney says that with Al in prison, she would \\"be there for him... no matter how long it takes.\\" Infinite Crisis Courtney is approached by the Shade, who tells her that her biological father is dead. This tragedy and her experience of the relationship between Liberty Belle and Jesse Quick prompts her to re-evaluate her family life.JSA #81 (March 2006) She discovers that she can't hate her biological father for his failings as a father and as a man. She also learns to accept Pat Dugan as her only real father figure. Stargirl becomes part of a coalition consisting of the JSA, the Doom Patrol and the Teen Titans that is organized to stop Superboy-Prime from destroying Smallville. Superboy-Prime kills several of the Titans, including Pantha and Baby Wildebeest and maims Risk, removing his arm. Stargirl later attends a memorial service for heroes who died in the Crisis. Afterwards, she begins attending college. She has altered her equipment: her rod now telescopes into a small cylinder, and her costume and belt materialize as the rod extends to full size. =\\"One Year Later\\"= Courtney joins the new roster of the Justice Society and fights without S.T.R.I.P.E.'s assistance.Justice Society of America #1, (2008) A seasoned hero despite her age, she forges a bond with her young teammate Cyclone, the eager and over-impulsive granddaughter of the first Red Tornado. They two bond after witnessing the death of Mister America and Courtney suggests Cyclone create a new superhero costume and name.Justice Society of America #3, (2008). DC Comics. Stargirl resumes her role of mentorship for the youngest heroes by helping Jefferson Pierce's daughter, Jennifer, cope with her powers and her isolation.Justice Society of America #12, (2008) Courtney later expresses to Damage her doubts about Gog.Justice Society of America: The Kingdom one-shot, (2008). DC Comics. A future version of Courtney is seen in Teen Titans #53 along with Lex Luthor and his future Titans. Her role is minimal, however, she is seen wearing Jack Knight's goggles and jacket‚Äîthe closest she has ever come to Jack's vision of \\"Starwoman\\" at the end of his series. In the Final Crisis miniseries, Courtney joins with other heroes to form an underground resistance against Darkseid.Final Crisis #1‚Äì5. DC Comics. Courtney is present (and apparently involved in voting) for discussions on how to move the JSA forward after the Gog debacle (and whom to retain or remove from the team) and she defends some of the heroes who sided with Gog. Later she is present when the JSA meet a depowered Billy Batson, who reveals his secret identity to the others.Justice Society of America vol. 3 #23 (January 2009). DC Comics. After the battle with Black Adam and Isis, Courtney was unhappy, as the events had happened on her birthday (and had ruined any planned celebrations). When she goes home and opens the door, the entire Justice Society is present and have prepared a late surprise party for her. Later she is unhappy to learn she still needed her braces despite being acknowledged as one of the senior members of the JSA.Justice Society of America vol. 3 #26 (April 2009). DC Comics. It has been established that both she and Atom Smasher love each other in direct quotes rather than asides and implied habits, but the elder JSA members' comments about their age difference forced Al to turn Courtney down, stating he loved her \\"like a sister\\".Justice Society of America vol. 3 #27 (May 2009). DC Comics.Justice Society of America vol. 3 #28 (June 2009). DC Comics. Following a massive supervillain attack, the JSA is split in two. Power Girl convinces Courtney to join the JSA All-Stars splinter group. She later expresses a deep feeling of regret over siding with the All-Stars, claiming that she feels more at home with the original roster.

DC Comics. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Stargirl appears as part of a new Justice League of America title. Born in Los Angeles, Courtney Whitmore was cleaning out the office of Barbara Whitmore's boyfriend Pat Dugan when she found a staff, a belt, and a shirt with a star on it. While trying them on, she became Stargirl and caught the perpetrator of a fire she spotted. The heroic actions went viral.Justice League of America #9. DC Comics. After talking to her friend about what happens next, Courtney was informed by Pat that the person who originally wielded the equipment has died. Though Pat agreed to train her, Courtney had to respond to the criminal activity caused by Shadow Thief who was taking hostages to draw out a superhero. She managed to rout out Shadow Thief. When Stargirl returned home, she found that Shadow Thief arrived first, killed her brother, and wounded Barbara and Ted. Stargirl used this trauma to become a better superhero.Justice League of America Vol. 3 #10-12. DC Comics.

Despite their strong numerical superiority and artillery, the Russians suffered the French attacks, before retiring the next day having suffered greater losses than the French, disorganizing their army for the rest of the year. Background =Strategic context= After defeating the Prussian army in the autumn of 1806, Emperor Napoleon entered partitioned Poland to confront the Russian army, which had been preparing to support the Prussians until their sudden defeat. Crossing the River Vistula, the French advance corps took Warsaw on 28 November 1806. Levin August Bennigsen The Russian army was under the overall command of Field Marshal Mikhail Kamensky, but he was old and becoming infirm. The Russian First Army of some 55,000 to 68,000 men,Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p38 commanded by Count Bennigsen, had fallen back from the Vistula to the line of the River Wkra (Ukra),Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p70 in order to unite with the Second Army, about 37,000 strong,Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p39 under General Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden (Buxh√∂wden), which was approaching from Russia and was still several days march from the First Army. However, realising his mistake in allowing the French to cross the Vistula, Kamensky advanced at the beginning of December to try to regain the line of the river.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p40 French forces crossed the Narew River at Modlin on 10 December, and the Prussian Corps commanded by General-Leutnant Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq failed to retake Thorn (Toru≈Ñ). This led Bennigsen on 11 December to issue orders to fall back and hold the line of the River Wkra.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p73 When this was reported to Napoleon, he assumed the Russians were in full retreat. He ordered the forces under Marshal Joachim Murat ‚Äì the 3rd corps of Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout, 7th Corps of Marshal Pierre Augereau, 5th Corps under Lannes, and Murat's 1st Cavalry Reserve Corps ‚Äì to pursue towards Pu≈Çtusk. Meanwhile, Marshal Michel Ney's 6th Corps, Marshal Jean- Baptiste Bernadotte's 1st Corps, and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res's 2nd Cavalry Reserve Corps turned the Russian right. Marshal Nicolas Soult's 4th Corps linked the two wings of the French army.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p76 Kamensky reversed the Russian retreat, and he ordered an advance to support the troops on the River Wkra.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p77 On the night of 23 and 24 December, Davout's corps forced a crossing of the lower Wkra in the Battle of Czarnowo.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p79-82 After engagements at Bie≈ºu≈Ñ on 23 December with Bessi√®res and Soldau (Dzia≈Çdowo) on 25 December with Ney, the Prussian corps under L'Estocq was driven north towards K√∂nigsberg.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, pp87-88 Augereau's corps seized a second crossing of the Wkra on the 24th at Ko≈ÇozƒÖb.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, pp84-85 Realising the danger, Kamensky ordered a retreat on Ostro≈Çƒôka. At this time the old field marshal appears to have had a mental breakdown and returned to Grodno. Bennigsen decided to disobey his superior's orders by standing and fighting on 26 December at Pu≈Çtusk. He had available the 2nd Division of Lieutenant General Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy, the 6th Division of Lieutenant General Alexander Karlovich Sedmoratski, part of Lieutenant General Dmitry Golitsyn's 4th Division, and part of Lieutenant General Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken's 3rd Division. To the north-west, most of the 4th Division commanded by Golitsyn and the 5th Division under Lieutenant General Dmitry Dokhturov fought the Battle of Go≈Çymin on the same day.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p89 =Weather= The weather caused severe difficulties for both sides. Mild autumn weather had lasted longer than normal.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p354 The usual frosts, which rendered the inadequate roads passable after the muddy conditions of autumn, were broken by thaws. There was a thaw on 17 DecemberCorrespondance de Napoleon Ier, XI 497 and a two-day thaw on 26 and 27 December.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p. 40 The result was that both sides found it very difficult to manoeuvre; in particular the French (as they were advancing) had great difficulty bringing up their artillery. Davout recorded it took two hours to cover 2¬Ω miles.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p. 93 There were also difficulties with supply. Captain Marcellin Marbot, who was serving with Augereau's Corps wrote: =Site= Pu≈Çtusk lies on the west bank of the River Narew with a suburb on the east bank. The road from Strzegociz crossed the river by a bridge and then ran north-west towards Go≈Çymin. A second road from Warsaw entered the town from the south-west, and then ran along the west bank of the river towards R√≥≈ºan. Before it reached Pu≈Çtusk this road was joined by one from Nasielsk. Another longer route to R√≥≈ºan ran along the east bank. The final road was that to Markow, which ran northwards from the town. The town itself lay on low ground. To the north and west lay a plateau, narrowing to a wide ridge nearer the river. A ravine cut into the plateau near the river. A large wood lay on the north-west side of the plateau, towards the village of Mosin. Further out from the plateau more woods covered the approaches from Warsaw.Petre \\" Poland\\", 2001 ed, pp90-91 Battle =Forces= Jean Lannes Lannes commanded two infantry divisions under Generals of Division Louis Gabriel Suchet and Honor√© Th√©odore Maxime Gazan de la Peyri√®re. Suchet's 1st Division included General of Brigade Michel Marie Clapar√®de's 3-battalion 17th Light Infantry Regiment, General of Brigade Honor√© Charles Reille's 4-battalion 34th Line Infantry Regiment and 3-battalion 40th Line Infantry Regiment, and General of Brigade Dominique Honor√© Antoine Vedel's 64th and 88th Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions each. Gazan's 2nd Division comprised General of Brigade Jean Fran√ßois Graindorge's 3-battalion 21st Light Infantry Regiment and 2-battalion 28th Light Infantry Regiment and General of Brigade Fran√ßois Fr√©d√©ric Campana's 100th and 103rd Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions each. General of Brigade Anne-Fran√ßois-Charles Trelliard led 12 squadrons of the corps cavalry, which consisted of the 9th and 10th Hussar Regiments and the 21st Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment. General of Brigade Louis Foucher de Careil commanded the corps artillery, 38 guns in four foot and two horse artillery batteries at full strength.Smith, p235. Smith itemized Colbert-Chabanais' 6th Corps cavalry but repeated Trelliard's list of regiments, which was clearly a misprint.Chandler Jena, p36 A. Ostermann- Tolstoi Historian Francis Loraine Petre wrote that General of Division Nicolas L√©onard Beker's 1,200-strong 5th Dragoon Division was also present, but did not note its composition.Petre, p 95. Petre mentioned Beker and Trelliard, but not Colbert-Chabanais.Petre, p177. Petre stated that Beker led the 5th Division. Digby Smith placed Beker in charge of the 2nd Dragoon Division and listed the 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and 22nd Dragoon Regiments as part of this unit.Smith, p235. These units are identical to Grouchy's division. General of Brigade Joseph Augustin Fournier Marquis de D'Aultane was the acting commander of the 3rd Division of Davout's corps. This unit was made up of two brigades. General of Brigade Claude Petit led the 2-battalion 12th Line Infantry Regiment and the 3-battalion 21st Line Infantry Regiment. General of Brigade Nicolas Hyacinthe Gautier directed the 25th and 85th Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions each. General of Division Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc led the 4th Dragoon Division, which only had one brigade present. General of Brigade Jacques L√©onard Laplanche commanded the 15th and 25th Dragoon Regiments.Smith, p235Chandler Jena, p35 Fournier had 70 chasseurs √† cheval, 100 dragoons, and only one artillery piece attached to his command.Petre \\"Poland\\" 2001 ed. p100. The rest of the corps cavalry was at Go≈Çymin. Bennigsen commanded Ostermann-Tolstoy's 2nd Division, Sedmoratski's 6th Division, and elements of the 3rd and 4th Divisions. The 2nd Division had three infantry and one cavalry brigades. Major General Nikolai Mazovsky directed the Pavlovski Grenadier and Rostov Musketeer Regiments, Major General Alexander Yakovlevich Sukin led the Petersburg Grenadier and Jeletzsky Musketeer Regiments, and Major General Ivan Andreievich Lieven commanded the 1st and 20th Jager Regiments. Major General Koschin's cavalry brigade included the Life Cuirassier, Kargopol Dragoon, and Soum Hussar Regiments, plus two cossack units. There were a total of 60 artillery pieces in four foot batteries and one horse artillery batteries.Millar, Left Wing The 6th Division also controlled three infantry and one cavalry brigades. Major General Karl Gustav von Baggovut led the Starokolski Musketeer and 4th J√§ger Regiments, Major General Vasili Sergeievich Rachmanov commanded the Vilnius and Nizov Musketeer Regiments, and Major General Fedosei Mikhailovich Bikov directed the Reval and Volhynia Musketeer Regiments. Major General Karl Osipovich Lambert's cavalry brigade comprised the Ekaterinoslav Cuirassier, Kiev Dragoon, and Alexandrov Hussar Regiments, plus one Tatar and one cossack unit. The 6th Division artillery numbered 72 guns in five foot and one horse artillery batteries. The units of the 3rd and 4th Divisions are not listed. Altogether, Bennigsen controlled 50,500 men in 66 battalions, 55 squadrons, and his artillery. =Action= The Pu≈Çtusk Campaign Map shows the positions of the French, Russian, and Prussian forces at the end of December 1806. Actions were fought at Bie≈ºu≈Ñ and Czarnowo on the 23rd, Ko≈ÇozƒÖb on the 24th, Soldau on the 25th, and Pu≈Çtusk and Go≈Çymin on the 26th. Bennigsen arrayed his forcesPetre \\"Poland\\" 2001 ed, p.90-107Chandler \\"Campaigns\\" p.521Chandler \\"Dictionary\\" p.439 along the Pu≈Çtusk-Go≈Çymin road, with three lines composed respectively of 21, 18 and 5 battalions. The left rested on the town, the right on the Mosin wood. The artillery was positioned in front of the first line. On the extreme right Major General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly occupied part of the Mosin wood with three battalions, a cavalry regiment and an artillery battery covering the road to Go≈Çymin. Baggovut covered the left of the line and the bridge over the Narew from a position in front of the ravine with ten battalions, two squadrons of dragoons and an artillery battery. Deployed along the edge of the ridge were 28 squadrons of cavalry linking Barclay de Tolly and Baggovut. Cossack cavalry was deployed in front of them.Petre \\"Poland\\" 2001 ed, p.91 Marshal Lannes had orders to cross the Narew at Pu≈Çtusk with his corps. He was aware that there was a Russian force in front of him, but did not know its size. After struggling through the mud, his first troops reached the area at about 10:00 AM,Petre \\"Poland\\" 2001 ed, p.95 and drove the cossacks back onto the Russian main line. Because of the terrain, Lannes could only see the Russian advance positions on the extreme left and right with the cavalry between them. Lannes deployed Suchet's division on his left, opposite the Mosin wood. Gazan's division covered the rest of the Russian line. The few guns were deployed on the left and in the centre. At about 11:00 AM the French right advanced against Baggovut. The Russian cossacks and cavalry were driven back and Baggovut sent forward a J√§ger unit, which was driven back despite artillery support. The French centre had also advanced, to attack Baggovut from the flank. But this manoeuvre exposed them to the Russian cavalry line, seven squadrons of which suddenly attacked the French flank in a sudden snow storm while Baggovut's cavalry and the j√§gers attacked from the front. A French infantry battalion then took the Russian cavalry in their flank. After a confused melee the Russians fell back to their original position. Lannes's cavalry division, under Trelliard tried to advance but was driven off by artillery fire. Battle of Pu≈Çtusk about noon At the same time as the French right attacked, on the French left Suchet's division, led by Lannes in person, attacked the position held by Barclay. The initial attack drove the Russians out of the wood, and captured the battery stationed there, but Barclay's reserve drove the French back into the wood and recaptured the guns. The French centre had also advanced. The Russian cavalry withdrew behind the main line, exposing the French to artillery fire from the Russian batteries. By about 2 p.m.Petre \\"Poland\\" 2001 ed, p.99 the French position looked dangerous. The Russian left had held, the French centre was suffering from the artillery fire, and on the right increasing pressure was beginning to force Suchet's men out of the wood. A French retreat looked a distinct possibility when unexpected reinforcements arrived. Battle of Pu≈Çtusk about 3 PM The 3rd Division of Davout's 3rd Corps, temporarily commanded by his Chief of Staff Fournier, had been ordered to pursue a Russian column apparently retiring on Pu≈Çtusk. Concerned about the strength of the Russian cavalry force which was escorting guns and stores, Fournier had pursued but not engaged. He was preparing to stop for the night when he heard the sounds of combat to his right, and so marched his men towards Pu≈Çtusk. Due to the state of the roads he was only able to bring up one gun. Seeing this force approach, Bennigsen wheeled back his main line to face the wood, thus reducing the artillery fire directed at Lannes's units. Barclay, finding Fournier attacking his right flank, fell back to the right of the main Russian line. Bennigsen reinforced him with two infantry regiments and some cavalry, and directed an artillery battery to fire on the wood. Thus reinforced Barclay attacked the wood. The French were driven out, and Fournier's right flank exposed. This was attacked by twenty squadrons of Russian cavalry, but the 85th French Infantry Regiment formed squares and by a steady fire drove the cavalry off. At about 8:00 PM the combat died away, and Fournier retired to the edge of the woods.Petre \\"Poland\\" 2001 ed, p.101 The arrival of Fournier's division also had an effect on the French right wing. With the switch of much of the Russian artillery to support Barclay de Tolly, the French were able to use their own guns to support a fresh attack at about 2:00 PMPetre \\"Poland\\" 2001 ed, p.102 on Baggovut by the brigades of Clapar√®de and Vedel, supported by Gazan on their left. Baggovut's men were driven back over the ravine in their rear, and their guns captured. Ostermann-Tolstoy established a battery to Barclay's right and reinforced by five battalions he attacked. After a desperate fight the French were thrown back and the guns recaptured. The French right and centre fell back to their start positions as night fell. During the night, Bennigsen decided to retire, and did so the next day, 27 December, using the longer road to R√≥≈ºan along the east bank of the Narew. From there he continued his retreat to Ostro≈Çƒôka. Fournier's division also moved off to rejoin the 3rd Corps at Golymin. Lannes was in no position to pursue the Russians, and occupied Pu≈Çtusk on 28 December. Analysis Losses on both sides are disputed. Lannes claimed the Russians lost 2,000 killed, 3,000 wounded and 1,800 prisoners, a total of 6,800; Sir Robert Wilson, British liaison officer with the Russian army, claimed the Russians lost less than 5,000 men. Lannes admitted 700 French killed and 1,500 wounded; Russian authorities said the French losses were 7,000 killed and wounded and 70 prisoners. Given that the French were attacking and exposed to artillery fire a total for them of 7,000 killed, wounded and prisoners does not seem unreasonable, and a total of 5,000 casualties for the Russians seems a good estimate.Petre \\"Poland\\" 2001 ed, p.103. Petre quotes the various authorities. Another authority gives French losses as five generals and 140 officers killed or wounded, 3,200 soldiers dead or wounded, and 700 captured. Russian losses are stated as 3,500 total, including 1,500 men and 12 guns captured. On the French side, Lannes, Bonnard, Clapar√®de, and Vedel were all wounded. Bennigsen claimed a victory. The consensus seems to bePetre \\"Poland\\" 2001 ed, p104-5 that having decided to fight, in defiance of his orders he could have better disposed his forces, taken the offensive and destroyed Lannes's corps before Fournier came up. Bennigsen said he thought he was facing 60,000 French under Napoleon in person, which may explain his defensive stance. Bennigsen also complained that Buxhoeveden did not support him, but that officer was obeying his orders to retire. Lannes, on the other hand, was following his orders, and the result was to find himself facing a superior force in a good defensive position. Napoleon's orders had not allowed for this, and unaware of the odds against him Lannes attacked. If Fournier had not used his initiative and marched to the sound of the guns the result may have been very different. Aftermath At the Battle of Go≈Çymin, Golitsyn successfully held off a superior French force. This, combined with the failure of Soult's corps to pass around the Russian right flank spoiled Napoleon's chances of cutting the Russian line of retreat and trapping them against the River Narew. The Russian 5th and 7th Divisions retired towards the main body of the army at R√≥≈ºan. Bennigsen's forces fell back to Nowogr√≥d on the River Narew, uniting on 1 January 1807 with the forces under Buxhoeveden. On 28 December, Napoleon stopped his advance and, having lost contact with the Russian army, decided to go into winter quarters. His troops were exhausted and discontented, and the supply situation was in great disorder.Petre \\"Poland\\", 2001 ed, p117 The break in hostilities did not last long. Soon afterward, Bennigsen was appointed army commander and he launched an unexpected winter offensive into East Prussia. Aimed at the French strategic left flank, the Russian blow was blunted at the Battle of Mohrungen on 25 January 1807. Napoleon immediately counterattacked, trying to cut the Russian communications line that ran to the northeast. The French caught up with the Russians on 7 and 8 February 1807 and the dreadful Battle of Eylau was fought. Popular Culture The battle is included in Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.

It was established in 1894 and was the second student publication to be established on campus. The Georgia Tech published a \\"Commencement Issue\\" that reviewed sporting events and gave information about each class. The \\"Commencement Issue\\" was likely similar to the Techniques Freshman Issue. The Technique was founded in 1911; its first issue was published on November 17, 1911 by editors Albert Blohm and E. A. Turner, and the content revolved around the upcoming rivalry football game against the University of Georgia. The first issue also featured an article by legendary football coach John Heisman. The Technique has been published weekly ever since, except for a brief period that the paper was published twice weekly. This period ran from January 14, 1948, to September 6, 1956. The Georgia Tech and the Technique operated separately for several years following the Techniques establishment, though the two publications eventually merged in 1916. Several sources claim that the Technique is among a number of student organizations to be founded by the ANAK Society. Present-day publication The Technique is published weekly during the fall and spring semesters, with the exceptions of \\"dead week\\", finals week, and spring break and is published biweekly during the summer semester. As of the 2005‚Äì2006 publication year, the paper has also taken a hiatus the week prior to spring break. General staff meetings are held on Tuesdays, when the majority of story assignments are made to a mostly volunteer writing staff. Deadline is on Wednesday nights during weeks when the paper is published, and the copy is sent to the printer on Thursday morning. The paper is then distributed around the campus on the Friday of that week. The Techniques office is located in the northwest corner of the Student Services Building. The paper is operated by a staff of approximately 50 paid and unpaid students, as well as two permanent, paid, non-student staff members. As Georgia Tech has no journalism school, the Technique welcomes all students within the institute to contribute to its content. The Technique is funded primarily by advertisements, and to a lesser extent by Tech's Student Government Association. The Technique is generally between 16 and 40 pages long, the length of an issue being dependent upon the number of advertisements purchased for a given week. The paper is organized into five sections: News (includes Georgia Tech-specific crime reports and news), Life (previously Focus; includes human interest stories), Entertainment (includes reviews of music, movies, performance arts, and video games, cartoons, a crossword puzzle, and sudoku puzzles), Opinions (includes editorials, an editorial cartoon, op-eds, and letters to the editor), and Sports (includes summaries of recent Georgia Tech sports games and sports features). Special editions =To Hell With Georgia= The most well-known of the special issues the Technique publishes is a satire of the University of Georgia's (UGA) student newspaper (The Red and Black). The tradition of this parody dates back to the very first issue of the Technique, which was published with the intent of taunting Georgia Tech's rival school, and has its roots in the embittered rivalry between Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia. It is published just before the two schools compete in football and is one of the last issues of the fall semester. The parody is known as \\"To Hell With Georgia\\", after the school's popular cheer. On years where the schools play their football match at UGA's Sanford Stadium, Technique staff distribute the issue across UGA's campus. In 2009, the THWGA issue was printed with an incorrect year in the masthead, though the date was corrected in the version posted online. =Freshman Issue= The Freshman Issue is another special edition of the Technique. It is the first issue published each academic year and is by far the longest issue, with each of the sections about as long as a normal issue. The content usually centers on the themes of welcoming freshmen and welcoming returning students back to Tech. The Freshman Issue also contains a special section dedicated to helping freshmen become more acquainted with Tech and its customs. It is generally the only issue in which content from previous issues is reprinted. =Other special editions= Other special editions include the Homecoming issue, the April Fool's issue (historically known as the Techlique, which includes a section of fake news parodying Tech in a similar style to the \\"To Hell With Georgia\\" issue) and the \\"Best of Tech\\" issue, which is the final issue of the spring semester. Recurring features =Two Bits= The Technique featured an anonymous humor column called \\"Two Bits\\", which is authored by the mysterious Two Bits Man, a sarcastic, everyday virtuoso who concerns himself with Tech- and university-specific subjects. His articles range from relentless sickly sniffles to school-wide subjects of controversy or interest. Popular targets for his scorn include Georgia Tech's Parking department and School of Physics, whereas he consistently praises the President Emeritus G. Wayne Clough, who he refers to as \\"Funk Masta G. Wayne\\". The Two Bits column had been discontinued in 2010, but was brought back in 2012, to again be discontinued in 2013. =Sliver Box= One of the Techniques most popular features is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent feature of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information, and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements in order to maintain a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes (\\"Slivers\\") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box. 1995 refusal of Campus Crusade for Christ ad In 1995, Campus Crusade for Christ registered a complaint with the attorney general's office protesting the paper's refusal of its ad which included a picture of a young man captioned ‚Äúa former homosexual, male prostitute and female impersonator.\\" right around National Coming Out Day. The CCC argued that the refusal amounted to a state censorship, because administration was allegedly involved in the decision and that administration is considered a state agency. Following the AG's opinion, the paper reluctantly agreed to run the ad, however, CCC withdrew the ad before it ran. People have sent in letters to the editor.

Categories *Regions: France has 18 regions, or 14 not including single territorial collectivities (collectivities with special status). *Departments: France has 95 departments as territorial collectivities, but the word is also used for the 101 territorial divisions of the State administration, which in most cases cover the same area as territorial collectivities. *Collectivities with special status: this status is awarded by specific laws to 6 collectivities which replace departments and regions (Corsica, the Greater LyonNot the same as intercommunal metropolis., Paris, Mayotte, French Guiana and Martinique). *Overseas collectivities (', COM): France has five COMs. *Provinces: There are 3 provinces, all in New Caledonia. *Communes: There are 36,782 communes.

Other facts *New Caledonia is the only French local government that is not a collectivit√© territoriale. It has its own articles in the French constitution. Since it cannot be categorized, it is sometimes unofficially called a collectivit√© sui generis (although \\"collectivity\\" is not, strictly speaking, a legal category). It is also unofficially called a pays (d'outre- mer), because its local legislative assembly (the congress) can rule using its own lois du pays. *Corsica became the only collectivit√© territoriale unique that is within metropolitan France starting on 1 January 2018, with new territorial elections held as a result. *The r√©gions are divided into d√©partements: ROMs are divided into DOMs; New Caledonia is divided into provinces; d√©partements, COMs (except Saint Barth√©lemy, Saint-Martin, and Wallis and Futuna), DOMs, and provinces all are divided into communes. *The commune of Poya is the only French subdivision assigned to two upper-level units (the provinces of North and South). *Paris and some overseas entities belong to two categories. ** Paris is both a d√©partement and a commune. It has one mayor and one assembly. ** French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and R√©union are both ROM and DOM. Guadeloupe and R√©union each have two presidents and two assemblies, while French Guiana, Martinique and Mayotte each have a single assembly. *Each COM has its own statutory law that gives it a particular designation: ** French Polynesia is designated as a pays d'outre- mer, ** Saint Barth√©lemy and Saint Martin as collectivit√©s, ** Saint Pierre and Miquelon as a collectivit√© territoriale, and ** Wallis and Futuna as a territoire.

The main game pitted two contestants in isolation booths attempting to correctly identify a person, place, or thing based on one-sentence clues. The bonus round then pitted the champion of the main game against a panel of three Ph.Ds, referred to as the \\"Spoilers\\". Alex Trebek was the host, with Johnny Olson and later Gene Wood announcing. The show was created by Jay Wolpert. Game play =Main game= Two contestants, each in separate isolation booths, attempted to correctly identify a person, place or thing based on one-sentence clues that were given to them, one at a time, on an electronic gameboard. The correct response was shown to the home audience before the first clue was given. A maximum of 10 clues were played per subject, typically starting with obscure pieces of trivia and progressing toward more widely-known facts. Either contestant could buzz in at any time to guess the subject, and doing so closed off the opponent's booth so that he/she could not see or hear anything. A correct guess won $50 for the contestant, while a miss closed his/her own booth and gave the opponent a chance to see the next clue (referred to as a \\"penalty clue\\") and offer a guess unopposed. If the opponent also missed, both booths were opened and play resumed with the next clue after the penalty. When a contestant correctly identified a subject on a buzz-in, he/she was shown the next clue in sequence and could dare the opponent to answer. When a contestant gave the answer on a penalty clue, it was used for the dare since the opponent had not yet seen it. If the contestant chose to dare, the opponent's booth was opened and he/she had five seconds to study the clue before guessing. A correct answer awarded $50 to the opponent; a miss awarded $100 to the daring contestant, closed the opponent's booth again, and gave the contestant a chance to offer a double dare based on the next clue. A correct answer on a double dare awarded $100 to the opponent, and a miss awarded $200 to the double-daring contestant. Play on a particular subject ended after any of the following occurred: * A contestant identified the subject, but chose not to dare * A contestant successfully dared the opponent, but chose not to double dare * An opponent correctly identified the subject on a dare * A double dare was played * Neither contestant identified the subject after all 10 clues were played The first contestant to accrue $500 or more won the game and moved on to the bonus round. Both contestants kept their accrued money, and the loser of each game also received parting gifts. Champions stayed on the show until defeated or until they surpassed CBS's maximum winnings limit (at the time $20,000 for this series). Alan Lusher was the only contestant to retire as champion after crossing the $20,000 threshold in the main game before picking up an extra $300 in the Spoilers round; he won a grand total of $20,500.Double Dare, week of January 3, 1977. Champion Alan Lusher was retired after passing $20,000 mark, but did not win bonus round. =Beat the Spoilers= The winner of the main game competed in a bonus round against the Spoilers, a panel of three Ph.Ds placed in separate isolation booths so that they could not see or hear each other. The booths were turned off to begin the round. The gameboard displayed a subject and eight numbered clues (10 in the pilot) in random order of difficulty, and was placed so that the Spoilers could not see it. The contestant selected one clue at a time and, after seeing and hearing it, had to decide whether to pass it or give it to the Spoilers. He/she could pass up to four times (five in the pilot), and these clues were immediately discarded from play. If the contestant decided to give a clue to the Spoilers, their booths were turned on long enough for Trebek to read it to them. The booths were then turned on, one at time, so that each Spoiler could guess the subject without being heard by the others. Each incorrect answer awarded $100 to the contestant, while a correct answer awarded the money to that Spoiler; he/she then took no further part in the round, and the booth was left turned on so that he/she could hear the others' guesses. The round continued as long as at least one Spoiler failed to guess correctly. If all three Spoilers managed to identify the subject, the contestant lost the round but received any money accumulated to that point from incorrect guesses. If any of the Spoilers were unable to identify the subject after the fourth (fifth in the pilot) given clue, the contestant won $5,000. Only once in the show's brief run did a contestant get shut out ($0) during a Spoilers round. The contestant in question was Ray Winston, during the episode originally aired January 21, 1977; in his first bonus round, he immediately used all four passes and every Spoiler guessed correctly on the first clue had had to give them. Alan Lusher, in addition to being the show's all-time winner and champion, went up against the Spoilers the most times (seven) and achieved three victories over them. Broadcast history Double Dare premiered on December 13, 1976, and replaced Gambit on CBS' daytime lineup at 11:00 AM Pacific (10:00 Central) following The Price Is Right. Facing NBC's popular two-year-old Wheel of Fortune, it did not draw the audience Gambit had. On March 7, 1977, Double Dare shifted back one hour from its original time slot in order to accommodate the hour-long Price Is Right taking the 10:30 AM timeslot. CBS saw no further success for the show at the earlier hour and decided to cancel Double Dare after twenty weeks and ninety-six total episodes. The final episode aired on April 29, 1977. Reruns of the series aired on GSN from 1996 to 1997, as well as in several one-off airings between 1998 and 2000, then returned to the regular schedule later in the decade, airing from 2007 to 2009. Buzzr then aired several episodes of Double Dare, including one of the 1976 pilot episodes, as part of its \\"Buzzr Lost and Found\\" special in September 2015. The series later won a slot on the network's Sunday night lineup by viewer vote through their Pick & Play Sweepstakes, with two episodes airing Sundays at 10 PM (PST). Production Jay Wolpert was acknowledged as the series' creator in the closing credits. Wolpert later created his own production company. This series also marked the debut of Jonathan Goodson as a producer. Markie Post was an employee of Goodson-Todman at the time and was an associate producer on Double Dare. Virtually all of the show's music and sounds were recycled for other Goodson-Todman shows. The show's theme music, composed by Edd Kalehoff for Score Productions, was reused one year later for Card Sharks. The sound effect for the opening of the clue board and the isolation booths was later used for The Price Is Rights Penny Ante and Vend-O-Price pricing games, as well as the bonus round level \\"wind-up\\" sound on the Jack Barry-produced game show The Joker's Wild. A truncated version of the \\"losing horns\\" from Price was also used for bonus round losses. The show's taping alternated between Studio 31, Studio 33 and Studio 41 at Television City Studios in Hollywood, California, during its run. Episode status All episodes are reported to exist, and the series has been shown on Game Show Network at various points during the late 1990s and part of the 2000s. A clip from the finale, where sexually-suggestive clues to \\"a boomerang\\" were presented, appeared on VH1's Game Show Moments Gone Bananas in 2005. Reruns later aired Sunday nights from 2015 to 2017 on Buzzr, an American digital broadcast television network rebroadcasting game shows from the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s. The first 20 episodes of the series (dubbed the \\"76 & 77\\" collection) were made available on Amazon Prime Video in North America.

The last shoot 'em up game to be created by Toaplan, the title takes place on a distant Earth-like planet where a global takeover operative led by king Renoselva A. Gladebaran VII is set into motion, as players assume the role from one of the six fighter pilots conforming the Skull Hornets squadron taking control of submersible jets in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the invading military force from the planet. Its gameplay mainly consists of shooting mixed with role-playing game-esque elements using a main two-button configuration. Headed by Fire Shark designer Yuko Tataka, Batsugun was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan and who would later go on to join one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 to continue working in the bullet hell sub-genre. Though first launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to the Sega Saturn by Gazelle and published exclusively in Japan by Banpresto on 25 October 1996, featuring various changes and additions compared with the original version. Batsugun has been met with mixed critical reception from critics and reviewers alike since its initial release in arcades and later on the Saturn as an import title. Nevertheless, the game garnered awards from Gamest magazine. It has been heralded by many as the first manic shooter due to its evolution of various gameplay features in the shoot 'em up genre and as an inspiration for other similar titles. As of 2019, the rights to the project are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. Batsugun is a science fiction-themed vertically scrolling bullet hell game where players assume the role of one of the six Skull Hornets pilots taking control of their respective fighter jets through five increasingly difficult levels in a last-ditch effort to overthrow a global takeover led by the army of king Renoselva A. Gladebaran VII as the main objective.Batsugun manual (Sega Saturn, JP) As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard; Players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a boss is reached. Players also have only two weapons at their disposal: the main gun that travels a max distance of the screen's height and three bombs capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. A unique gameplay feature is the weapon system; As enemies are destroyed, players gain experience points that are separate from the score and for every 288 experience points gained, the main gun is leveled up and becomes much stronger. This is analogous to exp and levelling up in role-playing games. The weapon can only level up twice, so after achieving its maximum level, 288 experience points will grant players an extra bomb stock instead. In addition, player can also grab \\"P\\" icons to increase the power of the current level gun. A maximum of five \\"P\\" icons can be collected per experience level and getting more after this gives extra points instead, while collecting \\"B\\" icons increases the number of bomb stock to a maximum of seven. Another gameplay feature, reminiscent of Aero Fighters, is the ability to choose between three fighter ship variations: Sky Mirage (type A), Dragon's Whisper (type B) and Judgement Flasher (type C). Type A ships have a simple array of rapid-fire energy-beams that spread evenly. Type B ships shoot a straight beam of lightning for as long as the fire button is held, while tapping the button causes sparks to appear and travel along the beam. Lastly, Type C ships are adaptable; holding the fire button shoot energy waves straight, while tapping the button fires a spread of projectiles. Each ship type becomes more powerful by leveling up. There are multiple scoring methods for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives in the game apart from destroying enemies, which are awarded at 1,000,000 points. Points can be gained from collecting V-shaped gold medals and once the level is finished, 3000 points are awarded for every small one, and 5000 points for every large one. Firing or bombing on determined locations is also crucial to reach high-scores, as certain setpieces in some stages hosts bonus secrets within their scenery, as well as destroying enemies on certain spots. The game employs a respawn system where a downed single player will start off immediately at the location they died at. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's firepower to its original state, in addition of all medals collected and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Unlike previous shoot 'em ups titles from Toaplan, there are no additional loops after completing the last stage.  Synopsis  = Plot = The plot summary of Batsugun is explained through supplementary materials. On a distant planet similar to Earth, a global takeover codenamed Epsilon Plan led by king Renoselva A. Gladebaran VII is set into motion, with the Imperial Army successfully staging multiple coup d'√©tats upon countries of the planet in less than two weeks. All that stands between the military forces of Renoselva and world domination are the Skull Hornets: a squadron of fighter pilots led by prince Olisis R. Gladebaran VIII, son of Renoselva. The Skull Hornets utilize the most powerful submersible jets the planet's scientists have ever devised. = Characters = * Jeeno: Pilot of the Type A (P1) ship. An attractive teenage soldier with cybernetic implants (courtesy of Dr. Gabriel) and a tragic past; he might also be the presumed-dead brother of Beltiana, but this is unconfirmed. * Schneider: Pilot of the Type A (P2) ship. A war veteran who has been recently awakened from cryogenic stasis. Previously, he was and the main protagonist of Flying Shark. * Beltiana: Pilot of the Type B (P1) ship. An attractive young woman who seeks to avenge the death of her brother (who may or may not still be alive as Jeeno). * Alteeno: Pilot of the Type B (P2) ship. The tomboyish mechanic of the Skull Hornets squadron. This attractive child prodigy has flowing red hair, which is normally tucked beneath a cap. * Iceman: Pilot of the Type C (P1) ship. This mercenary is an attractive young man with girl-length hair and a turbulent past. * Olisis: Pilot of the Type C (P2) ship. Founder and director of the Skull Hornets squadron. This attractive young man is the exiled prince of his home planet, fighting to dethrone his evil father Renoselva. If he triumphs, Olisis will become the eighth ruler of the Gladebaran Dynasty. (NOTE: his name is the Japanese form of Osiris.)  Development  Batsugun was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan such as Grind Stormer and who would later go on to join one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 to continue working in the bullet hell sub-genre. (Translation by Gamengai. ). (Translation by Gamengai. ). Its development was helmed by a small group at the company and most of the members had several roles during this process, with Fire Shark designer Yuko Tataka acting as both producer and co-designer alongside artists Junya Inoue and Takeshi Kawamoto. (Translation by Gamengai. ). Cave co-founder Tsuneki Ikeda served as one of its programmers prior to DonPachi alongside Satoshi K≈çyama, Seiji Iwakura and composer Yoshitatsu Sakai. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ).  Release  Batsugun Special Version Arcade printed circuit board. Batsugun was first launched in arcades worldwide by Toaplan, Taito and Unite Trading in 1993. During the same year, a soundtrack album containing music from the title was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon. Several promotional materials were also released by Toaplan. = Batsugun Special Version = A second edition, titled Batsugun Special Version, was showcased to attendees at the 1994 AOU Show in Japan but it was never officially released in arcades, as Toaplan slid into bankruptcy and this special version appeared on the secondary video game collecting market after the company vanished. The special version featured a number of changes compared to the original version including a much smaller hitbox, a shield protecting the player from one hit, more powerful bombs, new scoring items, and the addition of multiple loops of increasing difficulty after completing the initial loop, among other changes. = Sega Saturn = On 25 October 1996, Batsugun received a conversion to the Sega Saturn by Gazelle, an offshoot of Toaplan, and published exclusively in Japan by Banpresto. The Saturn version featured various changes and additions such as the inclusion of both the original and special versions as a 2-in-1 package, as well as an arranged soundtrack.  Reception  Batsugun has been met with mixed critical reception from critics and reviewers alike since its release on both the arcades and Sega Saturn. In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their February 1, 1994 issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Puyo Puyo and Samurai Shodown. In the April 1994 issue of Japanese publication Micom BASIC Magazine, the game was ranked on the number nine spot in popularity. Gamest simultaneously awarded the title with both the 6th \\"Best Shooting\\" and 36th \\"Best Character '94\\" awards. The Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine reviewers gave the Saturn conversion individual scores of 8, 8 and 6 respectively for a 7.33 rating in total. Edge gave the Saturn version a seven out of ten rating, deeming it \\"not a classic in designs terms, perhaps, but one that won't disappoint those yearning a show-off 2D title\\". French magazine Joypad gave the Saturn port a four out of five score. Christian Blendl of German magazine MAN!AC reviewed the Saturn release and gave it a 50 percent rating. Batsugun has also been met with mixed response by reviewers in recent years. Nick Zverloff of Hardcore Gaming 101 praised Inoue and Sakai's artwork and soundtrack respectively, among other aspects but criticized some of the additions in the Saturn conversion such as the arranged soundtrack.  Legacy  Batsugun has been regarded by multiple publications as the first manic shooter due to its evolution with use of complex enemy waves, bullet patterns, player firepower and hitbox. In addition, the game was also cited as an inspiration for other titles in the shoot 'em up genre since its release such as Cho Ren Sha 68K and Eschatos. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). After its initial launch, Toaplan would cease development of shooting projects prior to their closure on March 31, 1994. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). In more recent years, the rights to the title and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxton's Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by Masahiro Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia.

A conductive probe, usually only a few nanometers wide at the tip, is placed in full contact with an operational electronic or optoelectronic sample. By connecting the probe to a high-impedance voltmeter and rastering over the sample's surface, a map of the electric potential can be acquired. SVM is generally nondestructive to the sample although some damage may occur to the sample or the probe if the pressure required to maintain good electrical contact is too high. If the input impedance of the voltmeter is sufficiently large, the SVM probe should not perturb the operation of the operational sample. Applications SVM is particularly well suited to analyzing microelectronic devices (such as transistors or diodes) or quantum electronic devices (such as quantum well diode lasers) directly because nanometer spatial resolution is possible. SVM can also be used to verify theoretical simulation of complex electronic devices. For example, the potential profile across the quantum well structure of a diode laser can be mapped and analyzed; such a profile could indicate the electron and hole distributions where light is generated and could lead to improved laser designs. Scanning gate microscopy In a similar technique, scanning gate microscopy (SGM), the probe is oscillated at some natural frequency some fixed distance above the sample with an applied voltage relative to the sample. The image is constructed from the X,Y position of the probe and the conductance of the sample, with no significant current passing through the probe, which acts as a local gate. The image is interpreted as a map of the sample's sensitivity to gate voltage. A lock-in amplifier aids noise reduction by filtering through only the amplitude oscillations that match the probe's vibration frequency. Applications include imaging defect sites in carbon nanotubes and doping profiles in nanowires.

He also served six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1923 to 1935, and was Chancellor of Tennessee's Eighth Chancery District in the 1940s. As governor, he stabilized state finances, doubled the state's mileage of paved roads, and enacted legislation to curb voter fraud. His victory in the hard-fought 1948 gubernatorial campaign helped break the power of Memphis political boss E. H. Crump.Fred Rolater, \\"Gordon Weaver Browning,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 12 December 2012. In the years following World War II, Browning served in the Allied occupational government in Germany, and was a civil affairs advisor on the staff of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Early life Browning was born near Atwood in Carroll County, Tennessee, the son of James and Melissa (Brock) Browning. When he was still young, his parents moved to Milan, Tennessee, where his father served as a justice of the peace. He grew up in the historic Browning House. With After graduating from Milan High School in 1908, Browning enrolled in Valparaiso University in Indiana, where he earned tuition money waiting tables. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Pedagogy in 1913.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 325-329, 340-350. Browning taught school briefly before enrolling in the Cumberland School of Law in Lebanon, Tennessee. He graduated in 1915, and was admitted to the bar shortly afterward. In March 1915, he began practicing in the law office of George McCall in Huntingdon, Tennessee, in his native Carroll County. In June 1917, after the U.S. entry into World War I, Browning enlisted in the Tennessee National Guard as a 2nd lieutenant in Company D of the First Tennessee Field Artillery. This unit was activated as the 114th Field Artillery of the 30th Infantry Division, under the command of General Lawrence Tyson. Browning was promoted to captain, and transferred to Company A. He fought with the unit in northern France, and was cited for gallantry. After being discharged in 1919, Browning resumed practice of law in Huntingdon. In 1920, he ran for the 8th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost to his former law school classmate, Lon Scott, by a 50% to 49% margin.Our Campaigns - TN District 8, 1920. Retrieved: 13 December 2012. He ran again in 1922, and was victorious. He represented this district for five consecutive terms (frequently running unopposed), and represented the 7th district for one term (1933-1935) following redistricting. During his final term in the House, Browning was one of the \\"managers\\" (prosecutors) in the impeachment hearings of California judge Harold Louderback. In 1934, Browning sought the Democratic Party nomination for the U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated when Cordell Hull resigned to become Secretary of State. His chief opponent was Nathan L. Bachman, who had been temporarily appointed to the seat. Bachman had the support of Memphis political boss E. H. Crump, who was at the height of his power after the downfall of his rival, Luke Lea, and Browning struggled with voters in East Tennessee. He was defeated by Bachman, 166,293 votes to 121,169.Our Campaigns - TN US Senate, 1934. Retrieved: 13 December 2012. First gubernatorial term and World War II In 1936, incumbent Governor Hill McAlister angered Crump by proposing a state sales tax, and did not seek reelection. Browning sought the party's nomination, his chief opponent being Campbell County school superintendent Burgin Dossett. Crump initially proclaimed neutrality, but when it became clear Browning could win with or without the Shelby County vote, he endorsed Browning. Browning coasted to victory in the primary, and defeated the Republican candidate, Pat Thach, 332,523 votes to 77,392 in the general election.Our Campaigns - TN Governor, 1936. Retrieved: 13 December 2012. Browning had campaigned on cleaning up state government, getting the debt (which had skyrocketed to over $100 million by the time he took office) under control, and maintaining statewide prohibition (national prohibition had ended with the repeal of the 18th Amendment). In 1937, he signed the Debt Reorganization Act, which consolidated the state's debt, and enacted several taxes. Over the next 10 years, these efforts reduced the state's debt by 40%. He also created the Department of Conservation (now the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation), implemented the state portions of several federal programs aimed at providing Depression-era relief, and created a civil service merit system. Governor Browning and his wife, Ida, greet U.S. Supreme Court justice James C. McReynolds (left) at a reception in Washington in 1937 In April 1937, Senator Bachman (who had defeated Browning for the Senate seat in 1934) died in office. Browning engineered a plan that would have allowed him to take Bachman's seat, while helping Crump to defeat Kenneth McKellar for the other seat, and allowing Lewis S. Pope to become governor. The plan never materialized, however, as Crump refused to run against his longtime friend, McKellar. Furthermore, Browning had angered Crump by appointing several of Luke Lea's former associates to government positions, while ignoring Crump's requests for appointments. Browning appointed George L. Berry to finish Bachman's term. In 1938, Prentice Cooper, with Crump's endorsement, challenged Browning for the party's nomination for governor. After learning that Crump had registered over 100,000 voters in Shelby County, Browning sought to replace the primary system with a \\"county unit\\" system, which would equalize votes by county, thereby reducing the influence of Shelby. The bill passed, but was declared unconstitutional by the Tennessee Supreme Court prior to the election. Browning also formed a commission to investigate voter fraud in Shelby County, and managed to have over 13,000 voters purged. His efforts fell short, however, and he was defeated by Cooper, 231,852 votes to 158,854. Following his defeat in the primary, Browning returned to Huntingdon to practice law. In 1942, he was elected Chancellor of the Eighth Chancery District without opposition. In the months following the U.S. entry into World War II, Browning consistently sought a commission in the U.S. Army, but was thwarted by political foes. He finally appealed directly to the Army's adjutant general in Washington, and was commissioned in 1943 with the rank of captain. He attended the School of Military Government in Charlottesville, Virginia, which trained military officers in matters related to governing occupied territories, and was eventually promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He initially served as deputy head of the Belgium-Luxembourg mission, which aimed to restore civilian government to these areas, and aided in the Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge in early 1945. In September 1946, Browning was appointed commander of the military government in the Bremen enclave as part of the Allied Occupation of Germany.TRADOC and CSI, Armed Diplomacy: Two Centuries of American Campaigning (DIANE Publishing, 2003), p. 148. Second gubernatorial term Browning challenged incumbent Governor Jim Nance McCord for the nomination in 1946, though he was still in Europe and did not actively campaign. Though he lost, his 120,535 votes (to McCord's 187,119) showed he still had substantial support in Tennessee. In 1948, Browning again sought the nomination against McCord. Realizing it would take a considerable effort to defeat the Crump machine, he teamed up with Congressman Estes Kefauver, who was challenging Crump's candidate, Tom Stewart, for one of the state's U.S. Senate seats. Crump ran attack ads against Browning and Kefauver, criticizing the former for issuing too many pardons as governor, and accusing the latter of being a communist sympathizer. Browning compared Crump to Adolf Hitler, and told stories about Crump sneaking through Memphis cemeteries at night to find names of dead people to add to voter lists. He also attacked McCord for implementing a 2% state sales tax (which Crump had reluctantly supported). As the campaign heated up, Crump's hold on state politics appeared to be weakening. Congressman Al Gore, Sr., returned from Washington to canvass for Browning. Various voting blocks began turning against Crump, among them black voters in Memphis, who had grown tired of his control of the city. Returning veterans sympathized with Browning's military experience, while labor groups were angry with McCord for enacting a right-to-work law. On election day, Browning defeated McCord for the nomination, 231,852 votes to 158,854, and Kefauver defeated Stewart. It was the first defeat for a Crump- backed candidate in a major election in over two decades. In the general election, Browning faced country music singer Roy Acuff. Republicans had added Acuff's name to their primary ballot as a publicity stunt to draw attention to the party, and he unexpectedly won the nomination. Though Acuff ran a serious campaign, Browning nevertheless won easily, 363,903 votes to 179,957.Our Campaigns - TN Governor, 1948. Retrieved: 13 December 2012. During his second tenure as governor, Browning enacted several measures aimed at further weakening Crump and other political bosses, including laws requiring permanent voter registration, open election commission meetings, and metal ballot boxes in places where voting machines were not used. Browning signed legislation that partially eliminated the state's poll tax, which political bosses had used for decades to control votes. Along with election reforms, Browning also increased funding for rural schools and higher education, established a retirement system and minimum salaries for teachers, and expanded the state's system of paved roads from roughly to over .

Like other doctorates, it is usually an academic degree at the highest level; the degree may rank below, alongside, or above the Ph.D. depending on the specifics of the national system within which it is awarded. While the details of the degree vary, a doctor of technology program usually enables graduates to obtain an advanced level of knowledge in specialist fields and aims to produce graduates capable of advancing knowledge within their industry. The degree focuses on developing practical solutions in the workplace, critical analysis, synthesis, and innovation. As a substantive degree In South Africa, the Doctor of Technology or Doctor Technologiae (DTech) is equivalent to other research doctorates at level 10 of the South African National Qualifications Framework. It is normally awarded by universities of technology and can be awarded in a wide variety of fields, not just technology. In the United States, the Doctor of Industrial Technology (D.I.T.) degree was recognized by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as equivalent to the Ph.D. degree until 2008, when it was determined that it had moved to a more professional orientation and no longer met the NSF criteria for a research doctorate. In Finland, the degree tekniikan tohtori (TkT) or teknologie doktor (Doctor of Science (Technology), D.Sc. (Tech.)) is comparable to a Finnish filosofian tohtori (Doctor of Philosophy). In Sweden the situation is the same and the degrees are called teknologie doktor or teknisk doktor (\\"Tekn. Dr.\\" or \\"Tek. Dr.\\") and are translated to Ph.D. in English. The same can be stated for Austria, where universities of technology grant the title of \\"Dr.techn.\\" or \\"Doctor scientiae technicorum\\" as an equivalent to the Ph.D. Honorary degrees The Doctor of Technology degree may also be awarded as an honorary degree, that is, given to individuals who have made extensive contributions to a particular field and not necessarily for specific academic accomplishments. It is usual to signify this by adding (h.c.) for honoris causa after D.Tech. or to refer to the award as Hon.D.Tech or Hon DTech. Robert Gordon University (Aberdeen, Scotland) is one example of an establishment which awards such a degree. At the British Columbia Institute of Technology, the Doctor of Technology is also an honorary degree.

History Pools and fountains had been a feature from Roman times, but hydraulic engineers first took full advantage of characteristic sloping sites of villas in the hills surrounding Lazio, where there was copious available water. Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola's catene d'aqua (water chains) and water stairs, fountains, cascades, jets, pools and canals at Villa Farnese at Caprarola and Villa Lante at Bagnaia led the way. At Villa Lante a rill of water flows down the center of a stone picnic table. Cascade and fountain at the Royal Palace of Caserta French 16th- century gardens in the Ile-de-France were generally in flat terrain that did not lend itself to elaborate jeux d'eau. Fountains, bassins (pools in raised basins) and canals were more typical of French water features. For the jeux d'eau at Versailles, a watermill-driven pumping station (the machine de Marly, at the time being the most powerful machine in Europe) and elaborate aqueducts had to be constructed to bring water from many kilometers away. Sloping sites at the palaces of Caserta and Peterhof permitted grand cascades. At Caserta, a rill of water even flows down the handrail of a staircase balustrade. A favorite jeu d'eau was the practical joke of surprise water jets that could be turned on suddenly by a gardener accomplice turning a hidden wheel, trapping guests or soaking their finery. Joking water jets remained a feature in German gardens well into the 19th century. In the 1930s, Otto Przystawik invented the novelty musical fountain feature that came to be called \\"dancing waters\\". Early systems in displays and night clubs were manually operated by hand pumps and levers. Harold Steinman, the New York-based promoter of \\"Holiday on Ice\\", spotted the Przystawik display in a Berlin nightclub. He took the machine on tour with his roller-skating review where its success inspired him to send out duplicates on tours during the 1950s and 60s. In the later 20th century programmable \\"dancing waters\\" became a feature of novelty fountains associated with resort hotels, where they were combined with laser light shows. Elaborate moving water effects and shifting colored lighting were coordinated with recorded music. Such features draw crowds in Las Vegas, where they were initiated as part of Liberace's stage show and have been satirized in a Simpsons episode.

He attended Harvard College, graduating in 1858, along with classmates Henry Hobson Richardson and Henry Adams. Adams' Education of Henry Adams (1918) includes descriptions of his friendship with Crowninshield.Henry Adams. Education of Henry Adams. At Harvard, Crowninshield kept a daily diary through his junior and senior years, which was published in 1941 by his son Francis, under the title A Private Journal, 1856-1858\\\\.

He resided, in 1856, at Number 9 Hollis Hall. His diary records many activities, from visiting old friends through attending drawing courses and music lessons; going to dances, theatres, and concerts; playing billiards at Ripley's; and spending the evening in Parker's Restaurant; to spending a whole day making a model boat. Other people that he befriended at Harvard, according to his diary, include Robert Gould Shaw, whom Crowninshield first met when Shaw was a freshman who was hoping to become a member of the Pierian Sodality. Crowninshield was also friends at Harvard with William Henry Fitzhugh Lee. His diary entry for 1856-11-19, for example, records him playing whist \\"till the sociable (Lee's) was ready at L.

He was aide de camp to General Philip Sheridan, remaining with the General until mustered out on 1864-11-06. On 1865-06-17 he reached the highest rank that he was to attain, brevet colonel of the U.S. Volunteers. One coincidence that befell him during the War was that when W.H.F. Lee (by then major general in the Confederate army) was captured, as a prisoner he automatically fell under the direct control of the provost marshal. At the time, that was Crowninshield. Crowninshield 's son, Francis B.

In 2016 Holmes won a further Ivor Novello award for his score on the BBC series London Spy, directed by Jakob Verbruggen and starring Ben Whishaw, Jim Broadbent, and Charlotte Rampling. He composed music for the feature film Mindhorn starring Julian Barratt about a has-been British TV actor who used to be famous in the 1980s for playing the titular and charismatic lead role in the Isle of Man detective show Mindhorn, a character with a robotic eye that can literally \\"see the truth\\". Holmes released a Late Night Tales compilation in October 2016, titled Late Night Tales: David Holmes. Holmes produced the third album by Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Recorded and mixed in Belfast, the album Who Built the Moon? was released on 24 November 2017. In 2019, Holmes and American musician, composer and music producer Keith Ciancia won the Original Music category at the BAFTA TV Craft Awards for their work on the Killing Eve soundtrack.Meredith, Robbie.

She is most known for her work in the early era of the American soap opera, As the World Turns. Prinz originated the role of M'Lynn Eatenton in Steel Magnolias during its first production Off-Broadway. Early life and theatre Prinz was born in The Bronx, New York. Her father, Milton Prinz, was a talented cellist (many years later Prinz taped How to Survive a Marriage in the same studio where her father had performed with Arturo Toscanini) and Prinz herself spent her early years in the theater. After graduating from high school at age sixteen, she made her summer stock debut in a 1947 production of Dream Girl. In 1952, aged 21, she made her Broadway debut as a girl scout in The Grey-Eyed People and returned to Broadway in 1978 for a production of Tribute with Jack Lemmon. Prinz has continued to work in all forms of theater, including in recent years, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Master Class, Mame, and Annie Get Your Gun, and a 2003 New York appearance in Killing Louise. Television soap opera Prinz as Penny Hughes, 1958. Prinz made her television debut in the short-lived 1954 daytime drama First Love, as the wife of aviator Chris (Frankie Thomas). Her most famous role to date has been her portrayal of Penny Hughes on As the World Turns, a role she played from 1956-68. Penny had a number of storylines, but her most popular story was her tortured relationship with Jeff Baker (Mark Rydell). They were daytime's first teen romance and one of the show's most popular couples, breaking up and reuniting many times. The couple finally happily married and planned to adopt a child. Their story peaked when Jeff was killed in a car crash and Penny suffered from amnesia. Viewers were outraged; TV Guide called it \\"the auto accident that shook the nation.\\" Prinz sparred with Irna Phillips, the creator and writer of World Turns; at one point, the conflict between Prinz and Phillips led to Prinz having a nervous breakdown. When Prinz left World Turns in 1968, Prinz said she would never return to soap operas again. Prinz did return and appear on several shows, but signed for a limited engagement each time. In 1970, she returned to daytime to play the role of Amy Tyler on All My Children for that show's debut and for its first six months. Prinz agreed to accept the role on the condition that her character oppose the Vietnam War, which Prinz herself opposed, and on the condition that she be given above-the-title billing. Prinz was the only All My Children performer to ever receive that honor. This role was followed by a nine-month turn as the lead character, Dr. Julie Franklin, in How to Survive a Marriage in 1974. In 1988, she played Sister Mary Joel on Ryan's Hope. She made several returns to As the World Turns, during events that focused on Penny's family. She returned in 1985 for Bob and Kim's wedding and in 1986 to celebrate her parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary. She returned to As the World Turns again in 1998 so Penny could attend her mother's eightieth birthday party. Her final appearance on the show was in 2000 to visit her family for Christmas (the show ended in 2010). Prinz starred in the national tour of The Apple Tree in 1967. Her co-stars were Tom Ewell and Will MacKenzie. Later she starred in the second national tour of Driving Miss Daisy. In the late 1970s, Prinz began to make rare prime-time television appearances, including a recurring role on Knots Landing from 1981‚Äì82 as Sylvia Warren, who was convinced her husband was having an affair with Laura Avery (Constance McCashin). She appeared in the 1980 Hart to Hart episode \\"Cruise at Your Own Risk\\" (as Esther Goldwin). She also appeared on the ABC situation comedy Laverne and Shirley. Film In 2000, aged 69, Prinz made her film debut in the low-budget The Bread, My Sweet, which starred Scott Baio. Until that time the closest she had come to moviemaking was a 1948 film for the Navy, It Could Happen to Your Sister, in which she played a young woman who contracted an STD. In 2004 she completed a short film, Extreme Mom. Personal life Prinz was married to actor Michael Thoma from 1951‚Äì57 (Thoma died in 1982 at the age of 55), and has been married to jazz drummer Joseph Patti since 1966. Both unions were childless.

He led the state's mobilization efforts for World War II, when over 300,000 Tennesseans joined the armed forces, and numerous defense-related facilities were established across the state. He later served as U.S. Ambassador to Peru (1946-1948), and chaired Tennessee's 1953 constitutional convention.Governor Prentice Cooper Papers (finding aid) , Tennessee State Library and Archives, April 2002. Retrieved: December 14, 2012. Early life Cooper was born at the home of his maternal grandparents, River Side Farmhouse, along the Duck River in Bedford County, Tennessee. He was the son of William Prentice Cooper, an attorney and businessman, and Argentine (Shofner) Cooper. He attended private schools in nearby Shelbyville, and graduated in 1913 from the Webb School in Bell Buckle, where he was president of the debate team. In 1914, Cooper enrolled in Vanderbilt University, where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta and vice president of the freshman class. After two years, he transferred to Princeton University, from which he graduated in 1917 with a Bachelor of Arts. Following the U.S. entry into World War I, he enlisted in the Army, initially serving with the 307th Field Artillery before being transferred to Fort Monroe in Virginia. He was discharged in January 1919 with the rank of second lieutenant. Cooper enrolled in Harvard Law School in February 1919, and graduated with an LL.B in 1921. He was admitted to the bar in 1922, and began practice in Shelbyville. That same year, he was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, where he secured passage of the state's Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Cooper left the house after one term, and was elected district attorney of the state's Eighth Judicial District in 1925. He later served as a city attorney for Shelbyville. In the 1930s, he helped organize the Duck River Electric Membership Corporation, an electric cooperative. Governor Official portrait in the Tennessee State House In 1936, Cooper was elected to the Tennessee Senate, representing Bedford, Coffee, and Moore counties. In 1938, he ran for his party's nomination for governor with the support of Memphis political boss E. H. Crump. Crump was at the height of his power in state politics, and had had a falling out with the incumbent, Gordon Browning, over state appointments. He spent thousands of dollars on ads to boost Cooper's image and assail Browning, and Cooper won the nomination, 231,852 votes to 158,854.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 325-329, 325-335. In the general election, he defeated the Republican candidate, Howard Baker, Sr., 210,567 votes to 83,031.Our Campaigns - TN Governor, 1938. Retrieved: December 15, 2012. In the 1940 governor's race, Cooper defeated Knoxville inventor George Roby Dempster in the Democratic primary, and defeated C. Arthur Bruce by a more than 2-to-1 margin in the general election. In the 1942 race, Judge J. Ridley Mitchell, who despised Crump, sought the party's nomination for governor, but was defeated by Cooper, 171,259 votes to 124,037. Cooper easily defeated Republican candidate C.N. Frazier in the general election. Constitutional term limits prevented Cooper from seeking reelection in 1944. Cooper was Tennessee's governor during World War II. In 1940, anticipating the U.S. entry into the war, he organized the Tennessee State Defense Council, which many other states would later imitate. He also coordinated the establishment of draft boards, organized a state guard to replace the National Guard (which had been called up to active service), and established a model Home Food Supply Program. Large defense-related facilities were built throughout the state, including Fort Campbell, most of which is in Tennessee despite its Kentucky address, a naval training base in Millington, and Sewart Air Force Base in Smyrna. Defense-related plants, employing thousands of Tennesseans, were also built, among them a gunpowder plant at Millington, a shell-loading factory in Milan, and an aircraft factory in Nashville. In 1942, the federal government appropriated land in what is now Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for the top secret Manhattan Project which was developing the world's first atomic bomb. Cooper was not informed of the purpose of the project. When Anderson Countians complained to Cooper of land appropriations, Cooper accused the federal government of stealing the land for a \\"socialist\\" project. When officially notified in July 1943 by an Army lieutenant of the presidential proclamation making the area (which was in both Anderson and Roane counties) a military district not subject to state control he angrily ripped it to pieces. The new MED District Engineer Lt-Col. Kenneth Nichols had to placate him. \\"Oak Ridge, The Secret City,\\" Tennessee4me.org. Retrieved: December 15, 2012. pp99-100 Along with defense mobilization, Cooper increased funding for state schools, and implemented a program that provided free textbooks for children in grades 1 through 3. He also increased aid to the elderly, established a system of tuberculosis hospitals, and acquired land for state parks and state forests. He cut the state payroll and placed taxes on alcohol, and managed to reduce the state debt by $21 million. In January 1941, a Cooper-supported bill calling for a repeal of the state's poll tax was introduced in the state legislature, but was defeated. In 1943, the repeal passed, but was thrown out by the Tennessee Supreme Court. Later life Cooper was among 12 nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Franklin D. Roosevelt's running mate in the presidential election that year, receiving 26 votes. In 1946, Cooper was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Peru by President Truman. He convinced Peru to repay an outstanding loan to the United States, and had a reputation as a frugal entertainer. An Argentine newspaper accused Cooper of inciting a rebellion by APRA members in Callao in October 1948 (the rebellion took place several months after Cooper had left office), but Cooper adamantly denied any involvement. Cooper was chairman of the limited state constitutional convention of 1953, which proposed eight amendments to the Tennessee State Constitution, all of which were subsequently adopted by voters. The most notable of these amendments included the repeal of the poll tax, and the extension of the gubernatorial term from two years to four years. Encouraged by pro-segregation interests, Cooper challenged freshman U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr., in the 1958 Democratic primary, but lost handily, with Gore taking about 60% of the vote. Cooper remained an active participant in Democratic Party events until his death from cancer on May 18, 1969, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Family and legacy Gov.

Lake Texoma is formed by Denison Dam on the Red River in Bryan County, Oklahoma, and Grayson County, Texas, about upstream from the mouth of the river. It is located at the confluence of the Red and Washita Rivers. The project was completed in 1944. The damsite is about northwest of Denison, Texas, and southwest of Durant, Oklahoma. Lake Texoma is the most developed and most popular lake within the USACE Tulsa District, attracting around 6 million visitors a year. Oklahoma has more of the lake within its boundaries than Texas. Hydrology =Tributaries and outlet= Lake Texoma's two main sources are the Red River from the west and Washita River from the north. Other notable sources include Big Mineral Creek, Little Mineral Creek, Buncombe Creek, Rock Creek, and Glasses Creek. Lake Texoma drains into the Red River at the Denison Dam. =Water levels= Normal elevation of the conservation pool varies from National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) depending on the time of year. The flood control pool extends to elevation NGVD. The lake has crested the dam's spillway at a height of five times: once in 1957, again in 1990, 2007, May 24, 2015, and most recently on June 18, 2015. (USACE 2003a) The lake's previously highest elevation was recorded on May 6, 1990, at 644.76 feet. This record was broken on May 29, 2015, and the lake crested on June 1, 2015, at a new record elevation of 645.72 feet. The top of Denison Dam is at 670 feet. =Saltwater from the Red River= Salt beds in the Red River The Red River that formed Lake Texoma is a saltwater river due to salt deposits left over from a 250 million year old former sea that was in the current Texas-Oklahoma border region. As time passed, that sea evaporated, leaving salt deposits ‚Äî mostly sodium chloride. Rock and silt eventually buried the deposits, but the salt continues to leach through natural seeps in tributaries above Lake Texoma, sending as much as 3,450 tons of salt per day flowing down the Red River. The problem with the water in the Red River is much of it is too salty and requires costly treatment, if it is usable at all. Due to this phenomenon striped bass, a saltwater fish, thrive in Lake Texoma. Lake Texoma is home to the only self-sustaining population of striped bass in Texas. Geography Map of Lake Texoma Lake Texoma is situated on the border between the states of Oklahoma and Texas in the Oklahoma counties of Bryan, Marshall, Johnston, and Love, and the Texas counties of Grayson and Cooke. It has a surface area of 93,000 acres (360 km¬≤), a conservation water volume of , and a flood-control volume of . =Cities= Notable cities surrounding the lake in Texas are Denison, Sherman, and Gainesville. In Oklahoma, the most notable city is Durant. Other towns and cities near the lake in Bryan County, Oklahoma, include Cartwright, Colbert, Calera, Platter, and Mead. In Marshall County, Oklahoma, Madill and Kingston are the nearest cities with many notable communities near the lake including Enos, Little City, Cumberland, Kingston, Woodville, McBride, Willis, and the unsubmerged portion of Aylesworth. Most of Aylesworth was submerged under the water of the lake. Other towns and cities in Texas include Gordonville, Locust, Fink, Pottsboro, and Preston. =Islands= Several small islands on Lake Texoma are accessible only by means of water transportation. Some of the island names include, in order from west to east, West Island, Wood Island, Hog Island, Treasure Island, Little Island, and North Island. =Parks= Lake Texoma features two state parks, being Lake Texoma State Park in Oklahoma and Eisenhower State Park in Texas. It also has 54 USACE-managed parks. The northern and southern reaches of the lake each terminate within a national wildlife refuge. History Lake Texoma has grown in importance over the decades from primarily relief from annual flooding and destruction to an employment engine for the area, and finally a recreation mecca for the Nation. Mr. George Moulton who some consider the father of the Denison Dam was a Denison businessman who dreamed of placing a dam on the Red River at Baer‚Äôs Ferry as early as 1925. He began lobbying and talking to Chambers of Commerce in Denison and Durant in the late 1920s. Sam Rayburn joined the dream team in the early 1930s and was instrumental in the legislative process of making the great lake a reality. The Flood Control Act of 1938 (Public Law No. 761, 75th Congress, 3rd Session) authorized funding for the Denison dam, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set up the Denison District Office in June of that year. The first Commander was Captain Lucius D. Clay. Lake Texoma was constructed during WWII. German prisoners of war were involved in the construction of the dam and were the first POWs to be used in a labor camp. These prisoners were from Rommel‚Äôs Afrika Korps and were housed in camps at Tishomingo and Powell, Oklahoma. Later, the Tishomingo POWs were housed in another camp at the spillway. Only non-war related work could be performed by POWs according to the Geneva Convention ‚Äì such as clearing trees for the proposed lake and light construction. Construction projects performed by the prisoners included mortared stone lining of the drainage ditches around the damsite, which are still present today. Construction of the dam was completed in January 1944 at a cost of $54 million. The installation of the two generators was completed in September 1949. Initially Lake Texoma was authorized for flood control, hydropower and water supply. Recreation was not officially added as a project purpose by Congress until 1988. The management of the lands around Lake Texoma was turned over to the National Park Service in 1946 and they continued until 1949 when both agencies decided that the NPS would move out and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would take over the operations and maintenance responsibilities. The National Park Service was always a reluctant partner in this arrangement and finally removed themselves from Texoma in 1949. Lake Texoma has crested the spillway (640‚Äô elevation). The lake attracted worldwide media attention in June 2015 when water was drained following a flood, causing a vortex with 2.5-m-wide hole to form. Popularity Lake Texoma's popularity is largely attributed to its sheer size and proximity to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The lake is about an hour's drive north from the metropolitan area. The Lake Texoma area, known simply as Texoma or Texomaland, is experiencing rapid economic growth due to heavy tourist use. Recreation Diverse recreational opportunities include two wildlife refuges, two state parks, 54 USACE-managed parks, 12 marinas, 26 resorts, hundreds of campgrounds, and a variety of golf courses. Power boating, sailing, personal watercraft, water skiing, and wind surfing are all popular. The lake has become a major sailing center based on its size, depth, and miles of sailing shoreline. During the spring break and Fourth of July holidays, many college students home for the holidays gather in an area called \\"Fobb Bottom\\" on the Oklahoma side. Lake Texoma is also home to the Lakefest Regatta, widely considered to be the first inland charity regatta in the United States. The event typically attracts up to 100 keelboats and more than 500 sailors each spring. Since its inception, Lakefesttexomalakefest.org has raised more than $2 million in support of various children‚Äôs charities in North Texas. The current beneficiary is the Make-A-Wish Foundation¬Æ of North Texas.northtexas.wish.org Former professional funny car race driver \\"Flash\\" Gordon Mineo organized many \\"poker run\\" events on Lake Texoma. Gordon and his wife, Ann Mineo, along with three others, died September 2, 2006, in a boating accident on Lake Texoma.\\"Gordon and Ann Mineo.\\"Obituaries: Dallas Morning News. Accessed December 14, 2017. =Fishing= Management of the fishery resources at Lake Texoma is the responsibility of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (ODWC) and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). Lake Texoma provides habitat for at least 70 species of fish, several of which were introduced by the ODWC and TPWD. These agencies maintain a supplemental stocking program to improve the fishery resource. Those species popular for recreational fishing include largemouth, spotted, white, and striped bass (Micropterus salmoides, M. punctulatus, Morone chrysops, and M. saxatilis); white crappie (Pomoxis annularis); and channel, blue, and flathead catfish (Ictalurus punctatus, I. furcatus, and Pylodictis olivaris). The striped bass fishery in particular is very popular and is considered one most successful in the nation. In addition, downstream of the dam is a tailwater fishery that supports the species and the three local catfish. American gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), threadfin shad (D. petenense), and inland silverside (Menidia beryllina) are important forage species. Freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), gars (Lepisosteus spp.), buffaloes (Ictiobus spp.), and river carpsucker (Carpiodes carpio) also inhabit the lake. The lake was stocked with striped bass in the late 1960s, and has proven to be an excellent habitat for them. It is one of the seven U.S. inland lakes where the striped bass reproduce naturally, instead of being farmed and released into the waters. The \\"stripers\\" feed on large schools of shad, and often reach sizes of , with a lake record of caught April 25, 1984. The town of Kingston celebrates the importance of fishing to the local area with the annual Kingston Sandbass Festival each June. In 2004, a blue catfish was pulled from the lake that weighed , temporarily setting a world weight record for rod-and-reel-caught catfish. The fish was moved to a freshwater aquarium in Athens, Texas. More commonly, catfish in Lake Texoma weigh between . Historically, Texas and Oklahoma have not had a reciprocal fishing license agreement, which has posed a problem for anglers. Recent boundary resolutions have given Oklahoma jurisdiction over most of the fishing in Lake Texoma. An Oklahoma fishing license allows fishing most of the lake, up to within of Denison Dam. To fish the entire lake, a Lake Texoma fishing license was established and made available in 1979. =Camping= Many campgrounds, both public and private, exist along the shores of Lake Texoma. Among these are Eisenhower State Park, named for President Dwight Eisenhower, who was born in nearby Denison; Camp All Saints owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas; and James Ray Scout Reservation, owned by the Circle Ten Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Fees Because of a need to pay for maintenance and improvements, the State of Oklahoma has imposed a use fee on some Lake Texoma State Park visitors effective June 15, 2020. Private development initiatives Water going over emergency spillway for the third time in the dam's history, July, 2007 Recently, several large transfers of public land to private developers have been authorized by the federal government. The Water Resources Development Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-53 113 Stat. 359), authorized USACE to sell to the state of Oklahoma about of federally owned land on the north shore of Lake Texoma in Marshall County, Oklahoma, under lease at that time to the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department. The land was part of the Lake Texoma State Park, a conglomerate of state-owned and federally owned lands leased to the state, totaling around . The park was home to numerous state- and concession-operated facilities and activities, including a resort lodge with 106 guest rooms and suites. Initially, the State of Oklahoma Commissioners of the Land Office purchased only from USACE in March 2007. Soon after, the state reached an agreement with Pointe Vista Development, LLC, for the sale of roughly 750 acres (to include the land purchased from USACE and land already owned by the state) for the development of home sites and an upscale resort. Pointe Vista is a partnership between Mark Fischer, president and chief executive of Chaparral Energy, and Aubrey McClendon, chairman and chief executive of Chesapeake Energy. Also in 2007, the Governor of Oklahoma, Brad Henry, indicated that the state would likely purchase all or most of the remaining land at Texoma State Park under lease from USACE to transfer to Pointe Vista for further development. The new development is proposed to include 18‚Äì36 holes of championship golf, a club house and practice facility, aquatic center, outdoor recreation center, nature parks, campgrounds, retail shops, and an amphitheater. The new development will cost an estimated $360 million, which will also include housing, as well as a full-service hotel with restaurants, gym, business center, multiple swimming pools, spa, and meeting rooms. The proposed private community will have 250‚Äì350 high-end homes, ranging in size from . The Lake Texoma Lodge, built in 1951, officially closed its doors on December 1, 2006. The lodge was in poor repair, resulting in a steady decline in the facility's use. The lodge has since been demolished.\\"Officials unveil $350 million Lake Texoma private development deal\\" The Journal Record, March 17, 2006, Accessed June 8, 2009. Section 3182(j) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, authorized USACE to convey approximately of land at Lake Texoma to the city of Denison, Texas. The provision was backed by U.S. Congressman Ralph Hall (R) as an economic development initiative. The sale is to be at fair market value and the city of Denison is responsible for all costs associated with the transaction (costs for completing NEPA compliance documentation, surveys, appraisals, USACE administrative costs, etc.). The city in turn intends to sell the property to George Schuler, a local developer, for the creation of a private residential and recreational development on the conveyed land and adjacent land already owned by Mr. Schuler. The eventual development may result in as many as 10,000 residents locating in the Grandpappy Point area. The city and Mr. Schuler attempted to lease the same land from the Corps of Engineers in 2004, but abandoned those attempts in favor of legislation mandating the transfer, due to the inability to use the land for the intended purposes under a lease without an update of the Corps Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) for Lake Texoma. The majority of the land is currently zoned as Limited Development, Protected Area (suitable for nature hiking, birdwatching, etc.) and Aesthetic or Scenic areas. The Corps has previously stated that any revision of the SMP will require the completion of a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the entire Lake Texoma project that will consider the cumulative impacts of the extensive development that has occurred around the Lake since the original EIS was conducted in the 1970s. Completion of a lake-wde SEIS has been estimated by the Corps to take up to 2 years to complete at a cost of approximately $2.5 million. Since Section 3182(j) contained no provisions exempting the sale from the requirements of NEPA, it is expected that completion of the SEIS and revision of the SMP will also be required prior to completion of the sale, and that the city of Denison will be required to bear that as a cost associated with the transaction.

The term Stahlhelm refers both to a generic steel helmet, and more specifically to the distinctive German military design. The armies of major European powers introduced helmets of this type during World War I. The German Army began to replace the traditional boiled leather Pickelhaube () with the Stahlhelm in 1916. The Stahlhelm, with its distinctive \\"coal scuttle\\" shape, was instantly recognizable and became a common element of propaganda on both sides, just like the Pickelhaube before it. The name was also used by Der Stahlhelm, a German first World War ex-servicemen's organization existing from 1918 to 1935. After World War II, the German Bundeswehr () continued to call their standard helmet Stahlhelm, but the design was based on the American M1 helmet. The Bundesgrenzschutz (), however, continued to use the original German design, until either troop switched to the new M92 Aramid helmet. Development At the beginning of World War I, none of the combatants were issued with any form of protection for the head other than cloth and leather caps, designed at most to protect against saber cuts. When trench warfare began, the number of casualties on all sides suffering from severe head wounds (more often caused by shrapnel bullets or shell fragments than by gunfire) increased dramatically, since the head was typically the most exposed part of the body when in a trench. The French were the first to see a need for more protection‚Äîin late 1915 they began to issue Adrian helmets to their troops. The British and Commonwealth troops followed with the Brodie helmet (a development of which was also later worn by US forces) and the Germans with the Stahlhelm. As the German army behaved hesitantly in the development of an effective head protection, some units developed provisional helmets in 1915. Stationed in the rocky area of the Vosges the Army Detachment \\"Gaede\\" recorded significantly more head injuries caused by stone and shell splinters than did troops in other sectors of the front. The artillery workshop of the Army Detachment developed a helmet that consisted of a leather cap with a steel plate (6 mm thickness). The plate protected not only the forehead but also the eyes and nose. The helmet was quite deep relative to the thickness of the steel; one American company that tried to press similar thickness steel into the shape of the much shallower Brodie helmet was unable to do so.Tenner, Edward, and Edward Tenner. Our own devices: The past and future of body technology. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2003, p.252 The helmet had bullet resistant ability when pistol rounds like the 9mm Luger and 45 ACP could only dent the surface of it. History stormtrooper on the Western Front wearing the Stahlhelm The design of the Stahlhelm was carried out by Dr. Friedrich Schwerd of the Technical Institute of Hanover. In early 1915, Schwerd had carried out a study of head wounds suffered during trench warfare and submitted a recommendation for steel helmets, shortly after which he was ordered to Berlin. Schwerd then undertook the task of designing and producing a suitable helmet, broadly based on the 15th-century sallet, which provided good protection for the head and neck. After lengthy development work, which included testing a selection of German and Allied headgear, the first stahlhelm were tested in November 1915 at the Kummersdorf Proving Ground and then field tested by the 1st Assault Battalion. Thirty thousand examples were ordered, but it was not approved for general issue until New Year of 1916, hence it is most usually referred to as the \\"Model 1916\\". In February 1916 it was distributed to troops at Verdun, following which the incidence of serious head injuries fell dramatically. The first German troops to use this helmet were the stormtroopers of the Sturm-Bataillon Nr. 5 (Rohr), which was commanded by captain Willy Rohr. In contrast to the Hadfield steel used in the British Brodie helmet, the Germans used a harder martensitic silicon/nickel steel. As a result, and also due to the helmet's form, the Stahlhelm had to be formed in heated dies at a greater unit cost than the British helmet, which could be formed in one piece. Like the British and French, German troops identified highly with their helmets, as it became a popular symbol of paramilitary groups after the First World War. Such was the attachment of the World War One generation to the design that it was reportedly the reason that Hitler rejected a modernised, sloping helmet design to replace it.Tenner, Edward, and Edward Tenner. Our own devices: The past and future of body technology. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2003, pp.252-253 =Stahlhelm use in other countries= Germany exported versions of the M1935 helmet to various countries. Versions of the M1935 Stahlhelm were sent to Republic of China from 1935 to 1936 and M1935 helmet was the main helmet of the Chinese Nationalist Army during World War II. Spain also received shipments of the helmet. During the inter-war years several military missions were sent to South America under the command of Hans Kundt, after Chaco War the Bolivian army used to wear the helmet up until recently. The exported M1935 helmets were similar to the German issue, except for a different liner. Some countries manufactured their own helmets using the M1935 design, and this basic design was in use in various nations as late as the 1970s. The Germans allowed and assisted the Hungarians in copying their design of the M1935 steel helmet. Therefore, the WWII-produced M38 Hungarian steel helmet is nearly identical to the German M1935. Both have almost the same shape, riveted ventilation holes, and the classic rolled edge. Differences include somewhat rougher Hungarian finishing, a different liner and different rivets position - the split pins are situated behind the ventilation holes. A square metal bracket is riveted on the rear, above the back brim; used to secure the helmet to the knapsack while marching. It was typically painted in Hungarian brown-green, albeit blue-grey versions existed. It is sometimes called the \\"Finnish M35\\" due to their extensive use by the Finnish Army during the Continuation War 1941-44. After the end of World War I Poland seized large quantities of M1918 helmets. Most of those were later sold to various countries, including Spain. However, at the end of the 1930s it was discovered that the standard Polish wz. 31 helmet was unsuitable for tank troops and motorized units; while offering decent protection, it was too large and heavy. As a stop-gap measure before a new helmet was developed, the General Staff decided to issue M1918 helmets to the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, which used them during the Polish Defensive War. During the time of the Warsaw Uprising the helmet was also worn by the members of the Polish Home Army and it was during this time that the helmet became the symbol of the resistance, as every Stahlhelm worn by a soldier of the underground army signified a dead German occupier it was taken from. In November 1926, the Irish Defence Forces decided upon adopting the German Stahlhelm. However when the Irish government contacted German Foreign Office with a request for a sample they were informed that Germany was barred from exporting steel helmets by the Treaty of Versailles. The Irish then turned to London based Vickers, ordering 5,000 copies of a model closely resembling the M1918 helmet. The helmet remained in use until it was replaced by the British Mark II model in 1940. Following the outbreak of World War II, the helmets became the subject of anti-Irish propaganda originating in Britain. A large number of the withdrawn helmets were reissued to various emergency services after being painted white. Switzerland used a helmet, designated the M1918, that was roughly similar to the M1916, but had a shallower, wider and more rounded crown and skirt. This was to protect against the harsh winter winds of the alpine regions. The Chilean Army was a prolific user of the Vulkanfiber models, bought before the Second World War, along with a few M1935 and Czechoslovakian M32 helmet. After the war, local production of lightweight fiber and plastic models started, which are still in ceremonial & garrison use today. Small runs of steel helmets were made by FAMAE in the 80's, but ultimately were not adopted due to the ascendance of kevlar and synthetic ballistic fiber helmets by that time. A Stahlhelm with crossed bayonets and the corresponding number is the standard insignia of infantry regiments. The Argentine Army adopted a similar model, made of pressed fiber, during World War II, reflecting the traditional sympathy towards Germany found in many of the officers. For combat and provincial police use, imported Swiss M1918 Helmets were still in service as late as 1976. In the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, due to large quantities captured by World War II Partisans, the Stahlhelm was used in Yugoslav People's Army up to 1959, when it was phased out and replaced by the M59/85 steel helmet. Postwar After World War II, West Germany's Bundesgrenzschutz border guards and some West German police units kept the Stahlhelm in their inventories (police units can be seen wearing them during footage of the Black September hostage crisis in 1972), and the Fallschirmj√§ger variant was used for some time by the GSG 9. With the re-armament of West Germany the Bundeswehr introduced the United States Army M1 Helmet which was replaced by a Kevlar helmet (Gefechtshelm), similar to the modern US helmets, in the 1990s. German firefighter units today still use Stahlhelm-shaped helmets in a fluorescent color. East Germany's National People's Army M-56 helmet was modelled on an unused 1942 German design with a more conical shape. The Chilean Army still uses the Stahlhelm design for ceremonial purposes, as well as the Bolivian Army. There are also some Japanese bicycle helmets (with accompanying goggles) that resemble the Stahlhelm. Many schools and universities in Mexico such as the Autonomous University of Baja California have military bands that use or resemble the M35 Stahlhelm. The U.S. Army's 1980s and 1990s era Kevlar Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops Helmet was sometimes called the \\"Fritz helmet\\" for its resemblance to the Stahlhelm. The U.S. Army and Marines have continued to use a design akin to the PASGT helmet with the MICH TC-2000 Combat Helmet and Lightweight Helmet, respectively. The Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers still used M1935 helmets which were captured from the Chinese Nationalist Army during the Chinese Civil War until the 1970s. Since 2012, El Salvador's Policia Nacional Civil use a navy/indigo blue-coloured helmet that strongly resembles the Stahlhelm; this helmet is used by some members of the riot-control unit and rarely used by the Police's assault teams.

The inscription says \\"Putin, think or you'll end up like Hitler\\". Variants The different Stahlhelm designs are named for their year of introduction. For example, the Modell 1942 which was introduced in 1942 is commonly known as M1942 or simply M42. Here, they are referred to by their M19XX names. = M1916 and M1917 = camouflage pattern applied in the field. (Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e) Additional steel brow plate or Stirnpanzer on a Stahlhelm The Stahlhelm was introduced into regular service during the Verdun campaign in early 1916. The M1916 design had side-mounted horn-like ventilator lugs which were intended to be support for an additional steel brow plate or Stirnpanzer, which only ever saw limited use by snipers and trench raiding parties, as it was too heavy for general use. The shell came in different sizes, from 60 to 68, with some size 70s reported. Helmet weight varied from 0.98 kg to 1.4 kg, depending on shell size. The suspension, or liner, consisted of a headband with three segmented leather pouches, each holding padding materials, and leather or fabric cords could be adjusted to provide a comfortable fit. The one-piece leather chin strap was attached to the shell by M1891 chinstrap lugs, the same kind used in the Pickelhaube helmet. The M1916 design provided excellent protection: Reserve Lieutenant Walter Schulze of 8th Company Reserve Infantry Regiment 76 described his combat introduction to the helmet on the Somme, 29 July 1916: > ... suddenly, with a great clanging thud, I was hit on the forehead and > knocked flying onto the floor of the trench... a shrapnel bullet had hit my > helmet with great violence, without piercing it, but sufficiently hard to > dent it. If I had, as had been usual up until a few days previously, been > wearing a cap, then the Regiment would have had one more man killed. But the helmet was not without its flaws. The ventilator horns often let cold air in during the winter, requiring the wearer to block the vents with mud or fabric. The large, flared skirt tended to make it difficult for soldiers to hear, distorting surrounding sounds and creating an echo when the wearer spoke. Originally painted Feldgrau (field grey), the Stahlhelm was often camouflaged by troops in the field using mud, foliage, cloth covers, and paint. Official issue cloth covers in white and grey appeared in late 1916 and early 1917. Camouflage paint was not formally introduced until July 1918, when German Army Order II, No 91 366, signed by General Erich Ludendorff on 7 July 1918, outlined official standards for helmet camouflage. The order stipulated that helmets should be painted in several colors, separated by a finger-wide black line. The colors should be relevant to the season, such as using green, brown and ochre in summer. After the effectiveness of the M1916 design was validated during the 1916 campaigns, incremental improvements were subsequently made. The M1917 version saw improvements to the liner, but was otherwise identical to the original design. = M1918 = World War I Stahlhelm and anti-shrapnel body armour. Extensive redesigns were made for the M1918 model. A new two-piece chin strap was introduced, and was attached directly to the helmet liner rather than the shell. Certain examples of the M1918 had cutouts in the rim along the sides of the helmet. It has incorrectly been said that these cutouts were to accommodate using headphones while wearing the helmet. These cutouts were actually done to improve hearing and to reduce echo created by the large, flared skirt. The M1918 Stahlhelm can be distinguished from the M1916, as the M1918 shell lacks the chinstrap rivet on the lower side of the helmet skirt found on earlier models. = Austro- Hungarian variants = Austro-Hungarian soldiers at the Isonzo front with Stahlhelmen. The Austrian Berndorfer variant. Austria-Hungary purchased about 416,000 German helmets from November 1916 until the end of the war and also began its own licensed production starting in May 1917. Around a million Stahlhelm of all variants were issued until the end of the war.  Austrian M17  The Austrian M17 helmet was similar to the German M16, but was colored golden-brown (known as Isonzo-braun), had a cloth chinstrap and had the chinstrap rivet located higher up on the steel shell. From May 1917 till the end of World War I 534,013 were produced, many of which were manufactured at the Krupp in Berndorf, Lower Austria. Other production locations included: * Adolf Westen factory Celje, present day Slovenia * Brunn am Gebirge, present day Austria * C. A. Scholtz Mateocz, present day Slovakia * Bruder Lapp, Rottenman u. Warcholowsky * NƒÉdrag, present day Romania * Re»ôi»õa, present day Romania * Gebruder Bohler & Co. in Kapfenberg, present day Austria.  Hungarian M18  The Hungarian M18 variant was similar to the Austrian M17 design, but the chinstrap rivet was smaller in size and located even higher up than the Austrian version. It was colored in golden-brown (known as Isonzo- braun). These were manufactured at the Krupp in Berndorf, Lower Austria.  Berndorfer variant  There was also a quite different, domestically developed Berndorfer variant. 139,968 were produced from May till November 1917 at the Krupp in Berndorf, Lower Austria = Ottoman variant = The formation in 1917 by the Ottoman Empire of stormtrooper battalions following the German model prompted the requirement for steel helmets, as these had not previously been adopted. Although German helmets were ordered, Ottoman officers believed that the design impeded the soldiers' ability to hear orders in the field and requested that the visor, ear and neck protectors be removed, which was done using grinding machines. Germany delivered 5,400 visorless versions of the M1918 helmet for the Ottoman Empire. The missing front visor was thought by the Germans to be for religious reasons, and it was claimed that it was to allow Turkish soldiers to touch their foreheads to the ground during prayer, without removing their helmets. However, this story has been disputed. The Turks rejected any more than the 5,400 delivered and an unknown number from the overrun were issued to German armed forces and were used by German Freikorps units after the war. = M1933 = Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler troops wearing refurbished WW1 Stahlhelme, during a drill inspection in Berlin, 1938 German Reichswehr soldiers wearing WW1 Stahlhelme, but with the new insignia. M1933 Stahlhelm used by Feuerpolizei personnel during the Third Reich. Photo by Karl Gruber. In 1932 the Army High Command ordered the testing of a new prototype helmet intended to replace the older models. It was made entirely from a composite plastic material called \\"Vulkanfiber\\". The Model 1933 Vulkanfiber helmet kept the basic form of previous helmets, but was much lighter. It was put into limited production following favourable field tests in early 1933 and small numbers were issued to Reichswehr infantry, artillery and communications units. It was removed from service following the introduction of the M1935 helmet and most of the remaining stock were reissued to civil organizations such as fire brigades and police forces. Some examples were also retained for parade use by senior officers, who were not generally issued with the Stahlhelm. = M1935 = In 1934 tests began on an improved Stahlhelm, whose design was a development of World War I models. The Eisenh√ºttenwerke company of Thale carried out prototype design and testing, with Dr. Friedrich Schwerd once again taking a hand. The new helmet was pressed from sheets of molybdenum steel in several stages. The size of the flared visor and skirt was reduced, and the large projecting lugs for the obsolete armor shield were eliminated. The ventilator holes were retained, but were set in smaller hollow rivets mounted to the helmet's shell. The edges of the shell were rolled over, creating a smooth edge along the helmet. Finally, a completely new leather suspension, or liner, was incorporated that greatly improved the helmet's safety, adjustability, and comfort for each wearer. These improvements made the new M1935 helmet lighter, more compact, and more comfortable to wear than the previous designs. The Army's Supreme Command within the Third Reich's Wehrmacht combined armed forces officially accepted the new helmet on June 25, 1935 and it was intended to replace all other helmets in service. Liner system used in M35, M40 and M42 Stahlhelmen More than 1 million M1935 helmets were manufactured in the first two years after its introduction, and millions more were produced until 1940 when the basic design and production methods were changed. =Civil defence variant= 1944 pattern Luftschutz helmet In 1938, the Germans developed a variant of the Stahlhelm with a wider, flared peak and ventilation holes originally intended for firefighters, civil defense, Reichsarbeitsdienst, and Luftschutz personnel. Known as the gladiator pattern, the privately purchased Luftschutz helmet was originally made from three pieces of steel and typically painted black or dark blue. Later in the war these were issued to Volkssturm personnel, and sometimes repainted in Feldgrun. By 1944, the helmets were stamped from a single steel sheet, and the original cloth lining replaced with vinyl to reduce costs. Due to the relatively small number produced, original helmets from the war years are considered rare. However, a modified postwar version in fluorescent green, white or yellow continued to be issued to rescue workers in the Bundesrepublik until the early 1990s. = M1940 = The M1935 design was slightly modified in 1940 to simplify its construction, the manufacturing process now incorporating more automated stamping methods. The principal change was to stamp the ventilator hole mounts directly onto the shell, rather than utilizing separate fittings. In other respects, the M1940 helmet was identical to the M1935. The Germans still referred to the M1940 as the M1935, while the M1940 designation were given by collectors. Fallschirmj√§ger version Fallschirmj√§ger in 1943/1944 Salvaged helmets converted into saucepans at the end of World War II. A variant of the M1935 helmet with a shell lacking the projecting visor and deep, flared rim was issued to Fallschirmj√§ger (German paratrooper) units. It was so designed in order to lessen the risk of head injury on landing after a parachute jump; also to reduce the significant wind resistance and resulting neck trauma. Early Fallschirmj√§ger helmets were manufactured from existing M1935 helmets by removing the undesirable projections, which were omitted when the new design entered full production. The modified shell also incorporated a completely different and more substantial liner and chinstrap design that provided far more protection for German airborne troops. The chinstrap featured a four- point retention system that has come into use again by modern combat helmets such as the MICH since the late 1990s. = M1942 = The M1942 design was a result of wartime demands. From direct orders of the F√ºhrer, to ‚Äòmaintain intimidation but reduce cost‚Äô. The rolled edge on the shell was eliminated, creating an unfinished edge along the rim. This edge slightly flared out, along the base of the skirt, reducing the protection the helmet gave. The elimination of the rolled edge expedited the manufacturing process and reduced the amount of metal used in each helmet. Shell paint colors were typically matte grey-green (Heer) or grey-blue (Luftwaffe), and the decals were eliminated in 1943 to speed up production and reduce the helmet's combat visibility. Greater manufacturing flaws were also observed in M1942 helmets made late in the war. = M1944 = A simpler variant, designed in 1942 by the Institute for Defence Technical Materials Science in Berlin, was also stamped out of one piece of metal, but with sloped sides. It was similar in appearance to the British 1944 Type Mk III helmet. = M1945 = There have been reports of a variant manufactured in the last months of the war. The M1945 was reported to have been similar to the M1942 design, but did away completely with the ventilator. These helmets are reported to be extremely rare. Many collectors and historians are of the opinion that the M1945 helmet is just a regular M1942 helmet that lacked the vents simply because of machine malfunctions in the factory, or unfinished M1942 that were completed in the post-war era. = M1954 = A variant of the M1944 with a modified suspension system, developed further into the M1956. = M1956 = East German M1956 East German Stahlhelm The East German M-56 helmet was originally designed in 1942 as a replacement for the M1935/M1940 model Stahlhelm. It was initially developed for the Wehrmacht by the Institute for Defense Technical Materials Science in Berlin (see M1944 above). The helmet had seen trials since 1943, but was not adopted during World War II. The design was not used until the requirement for a distinct German helmet for the Volkspolizei and the National People's Army arose. The East German leadership was motivated in large part by a desire to avoid provoking the offence that using a traditional Stahlhelm design would have caused East Germany's Warsaw Pact allies (especially Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Soviet Union), but a more practical military necessity was also present due to the continued use of surplus Stahlhelmen by West German units, in particular border guards. Moreover, the East Germans suspected the West could re-issue the Stahlhelm on a general basis in the Bundeswehr at any time and therefore needed a helmet that was easily distinguishable from that of their potential enemy. For both reasons, the 1942 design was likely chosen because it was the most similar of all German designs to the most recognizable Soviet helmets, in particular the iconic SSh-40 design. Such a design not only served a political purpose, but was one that NATO armies were unlikely to closely duplicate. Indeed, the M-56 was similar enough in appearance to the SSh-40 that some Westerners failed to realize its German origins altogether and assumed the East Germans had adopted a Soviet design. The M-56 helmet came in three basic versions, Mod 1 or I/56, Mod 2 or I/57 and Mod 3 or I/71, and was widely sold (or given) to Third World armies. West German Helm M1A1 The West German M-56 Stahlhelm was a direct copy of the U.S. M1 helmet. It was properly called \\"zweiteiliger Stahlhelm\\" (two-piece steel helmet). In 1958 the helmet was made as a one- piece helmet and renamed Stahlhelm M1A1. The M1A1 came in three sizes: 66, 68, and 71. This helmet was used until 1981 when a modified version was released and renamed the Helm1A1. Modifications included a 3-point chin strap with the third point connecting at the nape, extra large sizes, and a further adjustable liner. The M1A1 Stahlhelm remained in service until 1992 when the Bundeswehr replaced it with a PASGT-derived kevlar helmet called the Gefechtshelm (\\"Combat helmet\\"). Decals and insignia After Stahlhelm shells were painted, the colours of which varied by organization, small identification or insignia decals usually were affixed to one or both sides of the helmet. Almost every military, naval, and political organization had its own distinctive insignia, which was applied as decals to the sides of helmets. The right side of early M35 helmets bore the tricolored shield of black, white, and red stripes, the traditional national colors of the pre-WWI German Empire (cf. the black, red, and gold of today's Federal Republic of Germany, harking back to the 1848 Revolt). The left side of the shell often received decal insignia denoting the branch of the armed forces, or Wehrmacht, or an organization within the Nazi Party. The combined Wehrmacht military forces of Nazi Germany consisted of the Heer (army), the Kriegsmarine (navy), and the Luftwaffe (air force). While not technically part of the Wehrmacht, the Waffen-SS (\\"Armed-SS\\") tactically operated as such and was considered part of Germany's armed forces during the war. The same was true of some Sturmabteilung (SA) units, along with other subsidiary organizations, which functioned as part of the armed forces particularly towards the end of the war. Wehrmacht branches typically displayed distinctive emblems in the form of decals on their helmets. The Heer, or army, displayed a black shield bearing the frontal view of a silver-colored German eagle holding a swastika in its talons (known as the Reichsadler), while the navy used the same eagle emblem in gold. Luftwaffe decals displayed the side view of an eagle in flight, also holding a swastika. The SS was both a paramilitary and a political organization, and its black runic initials on a silver-colored shield (normally applied to the right side of the shell) looked like twin lightning bolts. Other military, political, and civil or defense organizations used similar decal insignia to distinguish their helmets. Such visible identification devices were gradually abandoned as the war progressed, however, so that by war's end most Wehrmacht helmet insignia had been eliminated to reduce the wearer's visibility in combat. For the Chinese Nationalist Army soldiers, their M35 helmets were stenciled with the Chinese Nationalist Insignia on left side. Bolivian Army personnel carry the national flag decal on their Stahlhelms when in the full dress.

History In early 1895, hoping to be able to restrain the increased interest of foreigners in the Slovene mountains, Alja≈æ drew up with a chalk on the floor of his room in the Parish of Dovje plans for a cylindrical tower with a flag on its top. In April that year, he purchased the summit of Triglav for the sum of one Austro-Hungarian gulden from the then Municipality of Dovje. Having done so, he secured himself the right to erect a building on his own real property. The tower was constructed from iron and zinc-coated sheet steel by Anton Belec from ≈†entvid near Ljubljana. He and four workers brought the parts of the tower to the summit of Triglav and put the tower together in only five hours on 7 August 1895. Its opening ceremony and blessing took place in a small circle on 22 August that year. Alja≈æ donated the shelter to the Slovene Mountaineering Society. In the beginning, there were three four-legged chairs, a summit register, a spirit stove, and the image The Triglav Panorama by Marko Pernhart in the tower. It was later repainted and renovated several times by Alojz Knafelc and others. In the communist era, as the highest point of the former Yugoslavia, it was painted red and decorated with a red star. However, it has more or less retained its original appearance. The star was removed shortly before the dissolution of Yugoslavia. On the proclamation of Slovene independence in June 1991, the flag of Slovenia was ceremonially raised at the tower. On 5 October 1999, the tower and its immediate surroundings were proclaimed a site of national cultural importance for Slovenia. The tower was removed from the summit by helicopter for restoration on September 7, 2018, and put back on 3 October same year.

The name is often misspelled as Lancia IZM. Design In 1916, the Lancia 1Z armoured car was built by Ansaldo of Italy. It was the most common of the early Italian armoured cars. Based on a Lancia truck, the armoured car was an advanced design for its day. For firepower the vehicle was equipped with twin turret mounted machine guns. The initial ten vehicles featured a further small turret on top with yet another machine gun. This gave the vehicle considerable firepower for the time. As a result of experiences in World War I, steel rails were installed over the top of the vehicle for cutting wire. Having had good results with the early car, another production run of a slightly modified version (the Lancia 1ZM) or \\"Model 1918\\" was ordered. The major difference between the 1Z and 1ZM was that the 1ZM did not have the top turret with the extra machine gun. The Lancia 1ZM was the second batch of Ansaldo-Lancia armoured cars built. 110 cars of the improved model were ordered in 1917 and all were delivered before the end of 1918. Sometimes difficult to identify from the original Lancia 1Z (\\"Model 1916\\"), the most obvious difference is the removal of the top machine gun turret. This left the 1ZM with just the one larger, twin machine gun turret. Other features that will help are that the first 1ZM's usually have two spare tyres mounted on the right side of the vehicle (on the 1Z they were under the rear). The cooling vents and front armour of the engine compartment are slightly different and there are fewer vision ports in the armoured crew compartment. The front bumpers were also simplified. However, some of the original 1Z series were modified to initial 1ZM standard by the removal of the extra top turret and up-dating the chassis. This makes it possible to find photos of 1ZM armoured cars with both 1Z and 1ZM features. American troops on the Italian Front during World War I trained with and used some of these vehicles. In combat 1Z Armored Car during the Battle of Vittorio Veneto Obsolete Lancia pressed into German service in Yugoslavia, 1943 (Lancia 1ZM Panzersp√§hwagen, PK 501) The Lancia 1Z/1ZM armoured car saw little combat in World War I due to the mountainous terrain in which the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) fought. However, a few were deployed in the northern parts of the country where they saw combat against the Austro-Hungarian Army. After World War I, Lancia 1Z/1ZM armoured cars were sent to North Africa and to East Africa for policing duties. A few cars were also sent to the Albanian Kingdom where they were to form the sole armoured force of the country for many years. Some Lancia 1Z/1ZM played a minor role during the Italian invasion and the occupation of Ethiopia. Some Lancia 1Z/1ZM were sent to Spain during the Spanish Civil War and were used by the Italian Corps of Volunteer Troops (Corpo Truppe Volontarie Italia, or CTV). These armoured cars were already hopelessly outdated by this point and performed poorly against the Spanish Republican forces. A few obsolete Lancia 1Z/1ZM armoured cars were still in use with the Italian Royal Army during World War II. In 1940 and 1941, several vehicles served with the Royal Army during the East African Campaign. In some instances, operable machines were pressed into service by other Axis forces after the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943. In the service of the forces of Nazi Germany, the vehicle was identified as the Panzersp√§hwagen 1ZM (i).

In geometry an arrangement of lines is the partition of the plane formed by a collection of lines. Bounds on the complexity of arrangements have been studied in discrete geometry, and computational geometers have found algorithms for the efficient construction of arrangements. Definition For any set A of lines in the Euclidean plane, one can define an equivalence relation on the points of the plane according to which two points p and q are equivalent if, for every line l of A, either p and q are both on l or both belong to the same open half-plane bounded by l. When A is finite or locally finiteFor an arrangement to be locally finite, every bounded subset of the plane may be crossed by only finitely many lines. the equivalence classes of this relation are of three types: #the interiors of bounded or unbounded convex polygons (the cells of the arrangement), the connected components of the subset of the plane not contained in any of the lines of A, #open line segments and open infinite rays (the edges of the arrangement), the connected components of the points of a single line that do not belong to any other lines of A, and #single points (the vertices of the arrangement), the intersections of two or more lines of A. These three types of objects link together to form a cell complex covering the plane. Two arrangements are said to be isomorphic or combinatorially equivalent if there is a one-to-one adjacency-preserving correspondence between the objects in their associated cell complexes., page 4. Complexity of arrangements The study of arrangements was begun by Jakob Steiner, who proved the first bounds on the maximum number of features of different types that an arrangement may have.; . An arrangement with n lines has at most n(n ‚àí 1)/2 vertices, one per pair of crossing lines. This maximum is achieved for simple arrangements, those in which each two lines has a distinct pair of crossing points. In any arrangement there will be n infinite-downward rays, one per line; these rays separate n + 1 cells of the arrangement that are unbounded in the downward direction. The remaining cells all have a unique bottommost vertex,For cells in which there is a horizontal bottom edge, choose the bottommost vertex to be the right endpoint of the bottom edge. and each vertex is bottommost for a unique cell, so the number of cells in an arrangement is the number of vertices plus n + 1, or at most n(n + 1)/2 + 1; see lazy caterer's sequence. The number of edges of the arrangement is at most n2, as may be seen either by using the Euler characteristic to calculate it from the numbers of vertices and cells, or by observing that each line is partitioned into at most n edges by the other n ‚àí 1 lines; again, this worst-case bound is achieved for simple arrangements. The zone of a line l in a line arrangement is the collection of cells having edges belonging to l. The zone theorem states that the total number of edges in the cells of a single zone is linear. More precisely, the total number of edges of the cells belonging to a single side of line l is at most 5n ‚àí 1,, , . and the total number of edges of the cells belonging to both sides of l is at most \\\\lfloor 9.5n\\\\rfloor-1.. More generally, the total complexity of the cells of a line arrangement that are intersected by any convex curve is O(n Œ±(n)), where Œ± denotes the inverse Ackermann function, as may be shown using Davenport‚ÄìSchinzel sequences. Summing the complexities of all zones, one finds that the sum of squares of cell complexities in an arrangement is O(n2).. The k-level of an arrangement is the polygonal chain formed by the edges that have exactly k other lines directly below them, and the ‚â§k-level is the portion of the arrangement below the k-level. Finding matching upper and lower bounds for the complexity of a k-level remains a major open problem in discrete geometry; the best upper bound is O(nk1/3), while the best lower bound is Œ©(n exp(c (logk)1/2)).; . The problem of bounding the complexity of k-levels was first studied by and . In contrast, the maximum complexity of the ‚â§k-level is known to be Œò(nk).. A k-level is a special case of a monotone path in an arrangement; that is, a sequence of edges that intersects any vertical line in a single point. However, monotone paths may be much more complicated than k-levels: there exist arrangements and monotone paths in these arrangements where the number of points at which the path changes direction is Œ©(n2 ‚àí o(1)).; see also . Although a single cell in an arrangement may be bounded by all n lines, it is not possible in general for m different cells to all be bounded by n lines. Rather, the total complexity of m cells is at most Œò(m2/3n2/3 + n),; . almost the same bound as occurs in the Szemer√©di‚ÄìTrotter theorem on point-line incidences in the plane. A simple proof of this follows from the crossing number inequality:; . if m cells have a total of x + n edges, one can form a graph with m nodes (one per cell) and x edges (one per pair of consecutive cells on the same line). The edges of this graph can be drawn as curves that do not cross within the cells corresponding to their endpoints, and then follow the lines of the arrangement; therefore, there are O(n2) crossings in this drawing. However, by the crossing number inequality, there are Œ©(x3/m2) crossings; in order to satisfy both bounds, x must be O(m2/3n2/3).. Projective arrangements and projective duality It is often convenient to study line arrangements not in the Euclidean plane but in the projective plane, due to the fact that in projective geometry every pair of lines has a crossing point. In the projective plane, we may no longer define arrangements using sides of lines (a line in the projective plane does not separate the plane into two distinct sides), but we may still define the cells of an arrangement to be the connected components of the points not belonging to any line, the edges to be the connected components of sets of points belonging to a single line, and the vertices to be points where two or more lines cross. A line arrangement in the projective plane differs from its Euclidean counterpart in that the two Euclidean rays at either end of a line are replaced by a single edge in the projective plane that connects the leftmost and rightmost vertices on that line, and in that pairs of unbounded Euclidean cells are replaced in the projective plane by single cells that are crossed by the projective line at infinity. Due to projective duality, many statements about the combinatorial properties of points in the plane may be more easily understood in an equivalent dual form about arrangements of lines. For instance, the Sylvester‚ÄìGallai theorem, stating that any non-collinear set of points in the plane has an ordinary line containing exactly two points, transforms under projective duality to the statement that any arrangement of lines with more than one vertex has an ordinary point, a vertex where only two lines cross. The earliest known proof of the Sylvester‚ÄìGallai theorem, by , uses the Euler characteristic to show that such a vertex must always exist. Triangles in arrangements Kobon triangles in an arrangement of 17 lines An arrangement of lines in the projective plane is said to be simplicial if every cell of the arrangement is bounded by exactly three edges; simplicial arrangements were first studied by Melchior.; . Three infinite families of simplicial line arrangements are known: #A near-pencil consisting of n ‚àí 1 lines through a single point, together with a single additional line that does not go through the same point, #The family of lines formed by the sides of a regular polygon together with its axes of symmetry, and #The sides and axes of symmetry of an even regular polygon, together with the line at infinity. Additionally there are many other examples of sporadic simplicial arrangements that do not fit into any known infinite family.; . As Gr√ºnbaum writes, simplicial arrangements ‚Äúappear as examples or counterexamples in many contexts of combinatorial geometry and its applications.‚Äù For instance, use simplicial arrangements to construct counterexamples to a conjecture on the relation between the degree of a set of differential equations and the number of invariant lines the equations may have. The two known counterexamples to the Dirac‚ÄìMotzkin conjecture (which states that any n-line arrangement has at least n/2 ordinary points) are both simplicial.; ; ; , page 18. The dual graph of a line arrangement, in which there is one node per cell and one edge linking any pair of cells that share an edge of the arrangement, is a partial cube, a graph in which the nodes can be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that the graph distance equals the Hamming distance between labels; in the case of a line arrangement, each coordinate of the labeling assigns 0 to nodes on one side of one of the lines and 1 to nodes on the other side.. Dual graphs of simplicial arrangements have been used to construct infinite families of 3-regular partial cubes, isomorphic to the graphs of simple zonohedra.. It is also of interest to study the extremal numbers of triangular cells in arrangements that may not necessarily be simplicial. In any arrangement, there must be at least n triangles; every arrangement that has only n triangles must be simple.; ; . The maximum possible number of triangles in a simple arrangement is known to be upper bounded by n(n ‚àí 1)/3 and lower bounded by n(n ‚àí 3)/3; the lower bound is achieved by certain subsets of the diagonals of a regular 2n-gon.; . For non-simple arrangements the maximum number of triangles is similar but more tightly bounded.; ; . The closely related Kobon triangle problem asks for the maximum number of non-overlapping finite triangles (not necessarily faces) in an arrangement in the Euclidean plane; for some but not all values of n, n(n ‚àí 2)/3 triangles are possible. Multigrids and Penrose tilings The bisected hexagonal tiling. The dual graph of a simple line arrangement may be represented geometrically as a collection of rhombi, one per vertex of the arrangement, with sides perpendicular to the lines that meet at that vertex. These rhombi may be joined together to form a tiling of a convex polygon in the case of an arrangement of finitely many lines, or of the entire plane in the case of a locally finite arrangement with infinitely many lines. investigated special cases of this construction in which the line arrangement consists of k sets of equally spaced parallel lines. For two perpendicular families of parallel lines this construction just gives the familiar square tiling of the plane, and for three families of lines at 120-degree angles from each other (themselves forming a trihexagonal tiling) this produces the rhombille tiling. However, for more families of lines this construction produces aperiodic tilings. In particular, for five families of lines at equal angles to each other (or, as de Bruijn calls this arrangement, a pentagrid) it produces a family of tilings that include the rhombic version of the Penrose tilings. The tetrakis square tiling is an infinite arrangement of lines forming a periodic tiling that resembles a multigrid with four parallel families, but in which two of the families are more widely spaced than the other two, and in which the arrangement is simplicial rather than simple. Its dual is the truncated square tiling. Similarly, the triangular tiling is an infinite simplicial line arrangement with three parallel families, which has as its dual the hexagonal tiling, and the bisected hexagonal tiling is an infinite simplicial line arrangement with six parallel families and two line spacings, dual to the great rhombitrihexagonal tiling. Algorithms Constructing an arrangement means, given as input a list of the lines in the arrangement, computing a representation of the vertices, edges, and cells of the arrangement together with the adjacencies between these objects, for instance as a doubly connected edge list. Due to the zone theorem, arrangements can be constructed efficiently by an incremental algorithm that adds one line at a time to the arrangement of the previously added lines: each new line can be added in time proportional to its zone, resulting in a total construction time of O(n2). However, the memory requirements of this algorithm are high, so it may be more convenient to report all features of an arrangement by an algorithm that does not keep the entire arrangement in memory at once. This may again be done efficiently, in time O(n2) and space O(n), by an algorithmic technique known as topological sweeping.. Computing a line arrangement exactly requires a numerical precision several times greater than that of the input coordinates: if a line is specified by two points on it, the coordinates of the arrangement vertices may need four times as much precision as these input points. Therefore, computational geometers have also studied algorithms for constructing arrangements efficiently with limited numerical precision.; ; . As well, researchers have studied efficient algorithms for constructing smaller portions of an arrangement, such as zones,. k-levels,; ; ; . or the set of cells containing a given set of points.; ; . The problem of finding the arrangement vertex with the median x-coordinate arises (in a dual form) in robust statistics as the problem of computing the Theil‚ÄìSen estimator of a set of points.. Marc van Kreveld suggested the algorithmic problem of computing shortest paths between vertices in a line arrangement, where the paths are restricted to follow the edges of the arrangement, more quickly than the quadratic time that it would take to apply a shortest path algorithm to the whole arrangement graph.. An approximation algorithm is known,. and the problem may be solved efficiently for lines that fall into a small number of parallel families (as is typical for urban street grids),. but the general problem remains open. Non-Euclidean line arrangements A pseudoline arrangement is a family of curves that share similar topological properties with a line arrangement.; . These can be defined most simply in the projective plane as simple closed curves any two of which meet in a single crossing point.This definition is from . For a comparison of alternative definitions of pseudolines, see . A pseudoline arrangement is said to be stretchable if it is combinatorially equivalent to a line arrangement; it is complete for the existential theory of the reals to distinguish stretchable arrangements from non-stretchable ones.; . Every arrangement of finitely many pseudolines can be extended so that they become lines in a \\"spread\\", a type of non-Euclidean incidence geometry in which every two points of a topological plane are connected by a unique line (as in the Euclidean plane) but in which other axioms of Euclidean geometry may not apply. Another type of non-Euclidean geometry is the hyperbolic plane, and arrangements of hyperbolic lines in this geometry have also been studied. Any finite set of lines in the Euclidean plane has a combinatorially equivalent arrangement in the hyperbolic plane (e.g. by enclosing the vertices of the arrangement by a large circle and interpreting the interior of the circle as a Klein model of the hyperbolic plane). However, in hyperbolic line arrangements lines may avoid crossing each other without being parallel; the intersection graph of the lines in a hyperbolic arrangement is a circle graph. The corresponding concept to hyperbolic line arrangements for pseudolines is a weak pseudoline arrangement,. a family of curves having the same topological properties as linesHere an alternative definition from , that a pseudoline is the image of a line under a homeomorphism of the plane, is appropriate. such that any two curves in the family either meet in a single crossing point or have no intersection.

The intention had been to establish the party in 1991 but the \\"Telephone Coup\\" that removed President Ramsewak Shankar from office interfered with the planning. Winston Jessurun was one of the founders, together with Gerard Brunings. Brunings has stated that when establishing the party they asked the Dutch embassy for programs of Dutch political parties and that of Democrats 66 appealed most to them.

It further dropped to two in the 2000 elections and one in the 2005 elections. Even though the party gained only one seat it was able to join the third cabinet of President Ronald Venetiaan and had one Minister in the cabinet and received an ambassadorship.

His best-known work for the cinema was the screenplay for the original version of The Italian Job (1969). Biography =Early life= He was born in Rothesay, Isle of Bute, and educated at Finchley Catholic Grammar School and Trinity College, Dublin. He had a younger brother Ian, who is also a television writer best known for creating The Sweeney. =1960s= He began writing for BBC Television in 1958, beginning with the play Incident at Echo Six, and he wrote four further plays for the BBC over the following three years, before in 1961 creating his first series, Storyboard, a six-part anthology series that consisted both of original scripts and adaptations. The same year, he wrote the police drama The Interrogator. He wrote an important manifesto about new television drama in 1964, calling for a more mobile style of camera work and less emphasis on dialogue.Troy Kennedy Martin, \\"Nats go home,\\" Encore No. 48, March‚ÄìApril 1964 It was the genre of crime and policing that gave rise to his next and probably most famous television work, the drama series Z-Cars, which he co-created in 1962. Set in \\"Newtown\\", based on Kirkby near Liverpool, Z-Cars was revolutionary in that it depicted a hard-edged, grittier and much more realistic vision of the police force than had been seen on British television ‚Äì as a result, it was initially very unpopular with the real police.Lez Cooke, British Television Drama: A History, BFI (2003), Chapter 3. Although he left the programme after the two series, the series ran until 1978, and he returned to write the final episode. =1970s= Over the following decade he contributed to various television programmes, and made his first foray into feature films when he wrote The Italian Job, which was released in 1969 and starred No√´l Coward and Michael Caine. The following year he wrote Kelly's Heroes, and he scripted two more films during the 1970s ‚Äì The Jerusalem File (1971) and Sweeney 2 (1978). Sweeney 2 was the second cinematic spin-off from the television series The Sweeney, which had been created by his brother Ian Kennedy Martin, and for which he had written several episodes. He is less well known for writing a little-seen television sitcom based in the British Civil Service, If It Moves, File It (1970), featuring amongst others John Bird, who later co-starred in the satirical Bremner, Bird and Fortune. =1980s= In the early 1980s he was no less successful, with two highly popular series on different networks in 1983. The Old Men at the Zoo was an adaptation of the novel by Angus Wilson and screened on BBC One; the second was the hugely popular Reilly, Ace of Spies on ITV, based on the book by Robin Bruce Lockhart and starring Sam Neill. Greatly influenced by the political landscape of the early 1980s, he had drafted a script for a political thriller-cum-science fiction drama serial entitled Magnox, which became Edge of Darkness.Edge of Darkness, 'Introduction to the Screenplay', Faber and Faber (1989) He was interviewed about the genesis of the series for Magnox: The Secrets of Edge of Darkness documentary, an extra on the show's 2003 DVD release: The concept attracted little interest from television executives until incoming BBC Head of Drama Series & Serials Jonathan Powell picked it up in 1983, assigning experienced producer Michael Wearing to the project. Edge of Darkness was eventually screened on BBC2 in late 1985. Although Kennedy Martin had many creative differences with director Martin Campbell and star Bob Peck (who is reported to have vetoed the scripted ending with the remark \\"I'm not turning into a fucking tree!\\"), the drama was a resounding success, picking up several awards and being remembered as one of the best British television drama productions of the 1980s. Following Edge of Darkness he wrote another feature film screenplay, Red Heat (1988, co-written with director Walter Hill), which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. =1990s= Kennedy Martin did not return to television scriptwriting until the one-off BBC2 drama Hostile Waters in 1997. Other later work included the adaptation of Bravo Two Zero for BBC1 in 1999, co-written with the book's author Andy McNab and starring Sean Bean. =Death= He died of lung cancer on 15 September 2009 aged 77, in Ditchling, East Sussex.

The term was originally used during the Cold War to describe non-communists regarded as susceptible to communist propaganda and manipulation. The term has often been attributed to Vladimir Lenin, but this attribution is unsubstantiated.  Origin  The phrase \\"useful idiot\\" has often been attributed to Vladimir Lenin, but he is not documented as ever having used the phrase. In a 1987 article for The New York Times, American journalist William Safire investigated the origin of the term, noting that a senior reference librarian at the Library of Congress had been unable to find the phrase in Lenin's works and concluding that in the absence of new evidence, the term could not be attributed to Lenin. Similarly, the Oxford English Dictionary in defining \\"useful idiot\\" says: \\"The phrase does not seem to reflect any expression used within the Soviet Union\\". The term appeared in a June 1948 New York Times article on contemporary Italian politics (\\"Communist shift is seen in Europe\\"), citing the centrist social democratic Italian paper L'Umanit√†. L'Umanit√† wrote that left-wing social democrats, who had entered into a popular front with the Italian Communist Party during the 1948 elections, would be given the option to either merge with the Communists or leave the alliance. The term was later used in a 1955 article in the American Federation of Labor News-Reporter to refer to Italians who supported Communist causes. Time first used the phrase in January 1958, writing that some Italian Christian Democrats considered social activist Danilo Dolci a \\"useful idiot\\" for Communist causes. It has since recurred in that periodical's articles. A similar term, \\"useful innocents\\", appears in a 1946 Reader's Digest article titled \\"Yugoslavia's Tragic Lesson to the World\\", written by Bogdan Raditsa. Raditsa had served the Yugoslav government-in-exile during World War II, supported Josip Broz Tito's partisans (though not a Communist himself) and briefly served in Tito's new Yugoslav government before leaving for New York. \\"In the Serbo-Croat language\\", says Raditsa, \\"the communists have a phrase for true democrats who consent to collaborate with them for [the sake of] 'democracy'. It is Korisne Budale, or Useful Innocents.\\" In his 1947 book, Planned Chaos, Austrian-American economist Ludwig von Mises writes that the term \\"useful innocents\\" was used by Communists for liberals, whom von Mises describes as \\"confused and misguided sympathizers\\".Ludwig von Mises, Planned Chaos, Foundation for Economic Education, 1947, p. 17 in electronic document.  Select Usage  In 1959, Congressman Ed Derwinski of Illinois entered an editorial by the Chicago Daily Calumet into the Congressional record, referring to Americans who traveled to the Soviet Union to promote peace as \\"what Lenin calls useful idiots in the Communist game\\". In 1961, American journalist Frank Gibney wrote that Lenin had coined the phrase \\"useful idiot\\". Gibney wrote that the phrase was a good description of \\"Communist follower[s]\\" from Jean-Paul Sartre to left-wing socialists in Japan to members of the Chilean Popular Front. In a speech in 1965, Spruille Braden, an American diplomat who was stationed in a number of Latin American countries during the 1930s and 1940s and was later a lobbyist for the United Fruit Company, said the term was used by Joseph Stalin to refer to what Braden called \\"countless innocent although well-intentioned sentimentalists or idealists\\" who aided the Soviet agenda. Writing in The New York Times in 1987, William Safire discussed the increasing use of the term \\"useful idiot\\" against \\"anybody insufficiently anti-Communist in the view of the phrase's user\\", including Congressmen who supported the anti-Contras Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the Dutch socialists.

Alja≈æ was born in a small Upper Carniolan village of Zavrh pod ≈†marno Goro, northeast of Ljubljana, in what was then the Austrian Empire. He was a priest and also a successful composer, singer and choir master. His works are still very popular among Slovenes. He became known by having mountain huts built throughout the Julian Alps, which fostered the development of mountaineering in the Slovene Lands. By far his most well known construction is the Alja≈æ Tower (), built on the summit of Mount Triglav, the highest mountain of the Julian Alps and of Slovenia. He also arranged several hiking paths to be laid out, enabling more visitors to come to the mountains. The endeavours of Jakob Alja≈æ had a very influential role in the emergence of Mount Triglav as one of the central symbols of the Slovene people. The first verse from the patriotic poem Oh, Triglav, My Home () by Matija Zemljiƒç, put into music by Jakob Alja≈æ, is engraved in the Slovenian 50 cent euro coin.

It researches \\"the politics of law and the law of politics\\". The conceptual knowledge behind election law focuses on who votes, when that person can vote, and the construction behind the tabulated totals.  Issues  Some of the questions that are addressed by election law are: * Which people are entitled to vote in an election (e.g. age, residency or literacy requirements, or poll taxes), and the procedures by which such persons must register to vote or present identification in order to vote * Which people are entitled to hold office (for example, age, residency, birth or citizenship requirements), and the procedures candidates must follow to appear on the ballot (such as the formatting and filing of nominating petitions) and rules governing write-in candidates * The rules about what subjects may be submitted to a direct popular vote through a referendum or plebiscite, and the rules that governmental agencies or citizen groups must follow to place questions on the ballot for public consideration * The framework by which political parties may organize their internal government, and how they select candidates to run for political office (e.g. primary elections) * The financing of elections (e.g. contribution limits, rules for public financing of elections, the public disclosure of contributors, and rules governing interest groups other than a candidate's campaign organization) * The requirements for creating districts which elect representatives to a legislative assembly (examples include congressional districts, ridings or wards within a Municipality) * What restrictions are placed on campaign advocacy (such as rules on anonymous adds, false advertising, and limits on free speech) * How votes are cast at an election (including whether to use a paper ballot, or some other form of recording votes such as a mechanical voting machine or electronic voting device, and how information is presented to voters on the ballot or device) * How votes are counted at an election, recounts, and election challenges * Whether, and how, voters or candidates may file legal actions in a court of law or administrative agency to enforce their rights or contest the outcome of an election * Definition of electoral fraud and other crimes against the electoral system * The sources of election law (for example, constitutions, national statutes, state statutes, or judicial decisions) and the interplay between these sources of law  Sources of election law   Regimes in comparative law  = France = The French electoral code addresses most of the elections. However, other texts frame this material for special elections. Thus the Constitution but fixed some general basic provisions concerning the presidential election, the legislative and senatorial elections. For litigation election, the court depends on the concerned election. The Constitutional Council is responsible for the most important elections: presidential elections and senatorial elections or referendums. In contrast, to the municipal or district elections the administrative tribunal has jurisdiction, then the appeal is to the State Council. Finally, for the regional and European elections, the Council of State which has jurisdiction at first and last resort. In decisions on electoral matters, the law takes into account the results: if an essential principle is violated, the election is canceled but if fraud is \\"classic\\" (ballot stuffing, failure to register as voters, vote the dead ...) but the election was won (after counting of ballots invalidated) with a large or very large lead, the judge then cancels rarely the result.On the other side, opposite judgement comes when the participation of the lists has resulted in an imbalance, also because the deviation of the votes between the two clusters is less than one thousand ballotts: = Italy = The Italian Constitution fixes some general basic provisions concerning the legislative elections. Electoral disputes in Italy are complex because they are divided between several court orders. For example, with regard to the dispute concerning registration of candidates for ballots or litigation election, the administrative court has jurisdiction. For eligibility and disfranchisement, the judge is the ordinary tribunal.\\"A principle of separation of powers ( ... ) is the rationale of the law ( ... ) which ousts the administrative courts from ineligibility dispute\\": If a fraud is proven by the judge, it does not cancel necessarily the elections,The faults, as null and void, cannot justify a reversal \\"by forfeit\\" of the electoral outcome: unless they think that the result of election without the fraud would not have been identical. The survival of the acts already performed by the elected organs would seem solved by abundant case law that protects innocent trust of third parties. = = See Law of the United States = = In the United Kingdom, election law is legislated for by The Houses of Parliament. The statutory governance of UK Election law comes from acts of parliament such as the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011. The Electoral Commission's mandate and establishment was set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA), and ranges from the regulation of political donations and expenditure by political and third parties through to promoting greater participation in the electoral process. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 made a number of improvements to electoral registration, improving the security arrangements for absent voting, allowing observers to attend elections and a major change in reducing the minimum age for candidates at UK parliamentary elections. It also introduced the performance standards regime for electoral services.

The horse-chestnut leaf miner was first observed in North Macedonia in 1984, and was described as a new species in 1986.Horse chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella Desch. & Dem. (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) Exotic pest alert - Uk Forestry Commission Its larvae are leaf miners on the common horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum). The horse- chestnut leafminer was first collected and inadvertently pressed in herbarium sheets by the botanist Theodor von Heldreich in central Greece in 1879. Damage Leaf miner damage Leaf miner damage throughout the canopy Cameraria ohridella causes significant damage, mainly late summer browning, to the appearance of horse-chestnut trees. Despite the poor appearance of these infested trees, there is no evidence that damage by the moth leads to tree death. Seed weight, photosynthetic storage and reproductive capacity may however be reduced.Percival, G. C., Barrow I., Novissa K., Keary I., & Pennington P. 2011. The impact of horse chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella Deschka and Dimiƒá; HCLM) on vitality, growth and reproduction of Aesculus hippocastanum L. Urban Forestry & Urban Greening. 10: 11-17 Trees survive repeated infestations and re-flush normally in the following year. It appears that most of the damage caused by the moth occurs too late in the growing season to greatly affect tree performance. Consequently, there is no reason to fell and remove trees just because they are attacked by C. ohridella. The larva feeds in a mine in the leaves of the tree, damaging the leaves and stunting growth. Infected leaves are covered in small brown patches which spread rapidly across the entire tree, giving an autumnal appearance. Eventually the leaves die and drop off; when new ones grow they are again infected. This cycle can repeat itself several times in one season. Description Caterpillar Pupa The moth is up to long, with shiny, bright brown forewings with thin, silvery white stripes. The hindwings are dark grey with long fringes. Each female moth lays between 20 and 40 eggs singly on the upper surface of leaves, and once these hatch 2‚Äì3 weeks later, the larvae develop through five feeding phases (or instars) and two prepupal (spinning) phases before the pupal phase. The first stage creates a small cavity (or mine) parallel to a vein in the leaf and is \\"sap-sipping\\" rather than \\"tissue- feeding\\". By the third instar, the larva creates a mine approximately 8mm in diameter; this is further expanded by later instars until one mine can cover several square centimeters. The larva starts to pupate around four weeks after the egg hatches and, except when hibernating as a pupa in the mine, the adult emerges around two weeks later. In severe infestations, the mines of individuals can merge and almost the entire leaf area may be utilised. When this occurs it may lead to high moth mortality as the larvae compete for space and food. The moth is able to go through up to five generations each year, if the weather is hot and dry; on average in western Europe, the moth goes through three generations each year. The last generation of the year pupates for over six months so as to survive the winter. The pupae are extremely frost tolerant and have been recorded to survive temperatures as low as . This allows its populations to increase even after hard winters. The dead patches that the horse-chestnut leaf miner causes on leaves are similar to damage caused to horse-chestnut trees by the fungus Guignardia aesculi, but can be distinguished by the fungal infection often being outlined by a conspicuous yellow band which the mines lack. The pupae can be mistaken for pupae of the genus Phyllonorycter but can be distinguished because C. ohridella pupae do not have a cremaster and the first five abdominal sections have strong lateral spines on them. Distribution and dispersal Distribution map (1984-2007) Cameraria ohridella has now been found in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Poland, Serbia, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine. Encyclopedia of Life Although horse-chestnut occurs naturally mostly above the contours the moth does well in well-watered places such as parks in cities and at low elevation but not well in the hotter parts of Europe e.g. Spain. Probably aided greatly by vehicular transport, the moth has attained a very rapid dispersal rate across Europe of per year.≈†evrov√°, H. and La≈°t√∫vka, Z. 2001.

Long- distance dispersal and human population density allow the prediction of invasive patterns in the horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella. Journal of Animal Ecology. 73, 459-468 Origin and epidemiology Cameraria ohridella was first noticed from outbreaks near Ohrid Lake, Yugoslavia in 1984, and was described as a new species by Deschka and Dimiƒá in 1986. A likely Balkan origin for this moth was evidenced from a decrease in genetic diversity from natural towards artificial horse-chestnut stands that were planted around Europe since around 1600.Valade, R., Kenis, M., Hernandez-Lopez, A., Augustin, S., Mari Mena, N., Magnoux, E., Rougerie, R., Lakatos, F., Roques, A. and Lopez-Vaamonde, C. 2009. Mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers reveal a Balkan origin for the highly invasive horse-chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae). Molecular Ecology, 18: 3458-3470 This Balkan origin is further documented by numerous herbarium samples that date back to 1879. These include an outbreak which occurred in horse-chestnut specimens collected by F.K. Meyer in 1961 in Albania. Of the 30 known mitochondrial haplotypes for the species only three (known as A, B and C) have invaded the rest of Europe since 1989, and only A is dominant. It is likely that the frequency of haplotype A has been increasing even in Balkan natural sites, aided by the late development of roads in the region. Host plants As well as colonising the leaves of the common horse-chestnut, C. ohridella is also able to feed on Aesculus pavia, Acer platanoides and Acer pseudoplatanus, on which in particular one mitochondrial race, haplotype B, seems to develop successfully when nearby horse-chestnut leaves are exhausted,P√©r√©, C., Augustin S., Turlings T.

Control =Parasitoids= Over 60 generalist parasitoids have been recorded.de Prins W.;de Prins, J. 2005. Gracillariidae (Lepidoptera). Stenstrup: Apollo Books. However, for biological control a highly specialist parasitoid still needs to be found. =Predators= A blue tit feeding on C. ohridella Horse-chestnut leaf miner tree damage in Parma, Italy A number of natural predators of the larval stages of C. ohridella have been recorded. Observations have shown that blue tits (Parus caeruleus), great tits (Parus major) and marsh tits (Parus palustris) feed on the larvae. Between them, three tit species are thought to prey on between 2 and 4% of the larvae. The southern oak bushcricket (Meconema meridionale) has also been found to prey on C. ohridella, consuming around 10 larvae per day. Overall the predation by the southern oak bushcricket is insignificant compared to that by birds however. Experiments with the predatory mite Euseius finlandicus, bush crickets (Phaneroptera sp.), ladybirds and lacewings found that none prey on C. ohridella.

It has a rich history and rural tradition and is known as one of the sunniest villages in Slovenia. Its location is ideal for farming and this has been the main occupation of its inhabitants for many centuries. Name Dovje was attested in historical sources in 1029 as Lenginvu√©lt, in 1065 as Lenginvelt, and in 1318 as Langenuelt. The Slovene name is based on a translation of the German name (literally, 'long field'), presumably through dialect development from *dolgƒì (polje) 'long field', referring to the configuration of the village's territory. Cultural heritage The village has preserved a number of elements typical of alpine architecture. The most interesting of these are the arched front doors of the old houses. The view toward the Julian Alps from the village has made the cemetery next to St. Michael's Church an appropriate final resting place for many hikers that lost their lives on Mount Triglav and the surrounding mountains.

He was the last head of the Tammany Hall political machine to dominate municipal politics. Early life and career DeSapio was born in lower Manhattan. His father was an Italian immigrant from Sicily, while his mother was a second generation Italian American. DeSapio's father operated a trucking business. DeSapio graduated from Fordham University in 1931. He started his career in the Tammany Hall organization as an errand boy and messenger for precinct captains. DeSapio earned a reputation during his deliveries of coal and turkey on behalf of the local Tammany club by thanking recipients for their acceptance of Tammany handouts. Tammany Hall had dominated New York City politics from the mayoral victory of Fernando Wood in 1854 until the election of Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1933. Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site, archived November 30, 2010 from the original DeSapio was first elected a district captain in 1939, but was rejected by the leadership in the struggle between Irish and Italian interests for control of the organization. In 1943 he was accepted as district leader for lower Greenwich Village. Tammany Hall boss In 1949, DeSapio became the youngest \\"boss\\" in the history of Tammany Hall, succeeding Hugo Rogers. DeSapio's Italian heritage signaled the end of Tammany's longtime dominance by Irish- American politicians, and he became the first nationally prominent Italian- American political leader. Unlike many previous Tammany Hall bosses, DeSapio always made his decisions known to the public and promoted himself as a reformer. As boss of Tammany, he demonstrated liberal credentials when he diversified Tammany's leadership by naming the first Puerto Rican Manhattan district leader, Anthony Mandez, and backed Hulan Jack as Manhattan's first African-American Borough President. His ties with Frank Costello also failed to halt his rise to power in the local political scene. DeSapio reformed Tammany Hall's traditional sale of judgeships early in his role as Boss, reducing the cost of a position of judge from $75,000 to $25,000. This money was used to offset the cost of campaign expenses. =Public image= DeSapio always seemed a personally modest man. Even though he operated out of four lavish offices, he lived for fifty years in a middle-class apartment on Washington Square with his wife Theresa Natale (\\"Natalie\\") and daughter Geraldine. As leader of Tammany Hall, DeSapio reveled in the limelight, attending charitable fund-raising events, making himself available to the press, and delivering speeches in highbrow venues that were thought off-limits to political bosses. In wielding his enormous political clout, he usually preferred extensive consultations and consensus-building to unilateral decision-making. His 16- to-18-hour workday began with pre-breakfast phone calls at home where, still dressed in pajamas and bathrobe, he received a stream of political associates. DeSapio would then visit his various offices for further meetings, and cram in a half-dozen public functions, including radio and television appearances and a late-night political dinner. DeSapio succeeded in shucking Tammany's notoriety and fashioning himself as a sophisticated, enlightened and modern political boss. He favored well- tailored, dark suits and striped ties, and always looked as if he had just stepped out of a barber's chair. The only incongruity was the dark glasses he was forced to always wear because of chronic iritis. =Involvement with organized crime= Throughout his political life, DeSapio was noted for alleged involvement with organized crime, even though he fought to distance the organization from the unsavory days of Boss Tweed, and allegations of corruption. In 1951, Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee concluded that DeSapio was assisting the activities of New York's most powerful mobster Frank Costello, and that Costello had become influential in decisions made by the Tammany Hall council. DeSapio admitted to having met Costello several times, but insisted that \\"politics was never discussed\\". These connections were examined by the Kefauver Commission. However, it later became apparent that he was also selling out to benefit local mobsters such as Costello. DeSapio was accused of staffing New York City's government with clubhouse hacks. He followed the Tammany custom of selling judicial nominations, although he did cut the fee that would-be judges were required to pay. He steered valuable city contracts for streetlights and parking meters to the Broadway Maintenance Corporation, a company that, according to the State Investigation Commission, cheated taxpayers out of millions of dollars. =1953 mayoral election= In 1953, he earned new respect and public admiration when he turned against the other Democratic leaders in New York City and used the power of Tammany Hall to help ensure that the highly-unpopular incumbent mayor, Vincent R. Impellitteri, was defeated in the Democratic Party primary by Robert F. Wagner, Jr., an outspoken pro-reform Democrat,James F. Clarity, \\"Robert Wagner, 80, Pivotal New York Mayor, Dies\\". Published: February 13, 1991. Correction Appended. and then helped assure Wagner's victory in the general election. Following Wagner's success, DeSapio became a powerful and well- respected kingmaker in the New York political scene. =1958 U.S. Senate race= In 1958, DeSapio's image was severely damaged after he successfully manoeuvred to have his own candidate for Senate, Manhattan District Attorney Frank Hogan, placed on the Democratic and Liberal ticket. New Yorkers now saw DeSapio as an old-time Tammany Hall boss and Hogan lost the Senate election to Republican Kenneth Keating. Republican Nelson Rockefeller was elected Governor the same year as well. Democrats who had once praised DeSapio now found it expedient to excoriate him. In 1961, Wagner won re-election by running a reformist campaign that denounced his former patron, DeSapio, as an undemocratic practitioner of Tammany machine politics. The same year, DeSapio lost the district leadership of his native Greenwich Village, a post he had held for two decades, to an upstart reform Democrat, James Lanigan, who was backed by nationally-known liberal Democrats such as Wagner, Eleanor Roosevelt and former Senator Herbert H. Lehman. =Ouster= His leadership ended in 1961, and with it the dynasty that was Tammany Hall. It took several years of work by Eleanor Roosevelt to bring this about. She told local journalist Murray Kempton, who published her remarks many years later in 1991 when he was a columnist for Newsday, \\"I told Carmine I would get him for what he did to Franklin, and get him I did.\\" She had vowed revenge because she felt DeSapio had derailed her son's (Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr.) political ambitions by persuading him to abandon his run for Governor of New York in 1954 and instead run for New York Attorney General. After Roosevelt dropped out, DeSapio then got the local Democratic Party officials to accept former banker and diplomat W. Averell Harriman as the Democratic Party's nominee for governor in the New York state election. Harriman barely managed to secure victory as Governor of New York and Roosevelt would lose his bid to become the New York Attorney General. Following Harriman's victory, DeSapio served in Harriman's cabinet as Secretary of State of New York.Following his loss, Later career In 1963 and 1965, after Lanigan stepped down, DeSapio tried to retake his position as Greenwich Village district leader, but was twice defeated by another reform candidate, Edward I. Koch, who would later go on to become mayor. DeSapio reached a low point in 1969 when he was convicted in a Federal Court of conspiracy and bribery after it was acknowledged that he conspired to bribe the former New York City water commissioner, James L. Marcus, and extort contracts from Consolidated Edison that would result in kickbacks. He served two years in federal prison (1971‚Äì1973). After his release, he never re- entered politics, but did support many community, charitable, and civic causes. He regained some of his former popularity through his skill as a speaker. In 1992, former Mayor Ed Koch, his opponent in 1963 and 1965, whom DeSapio had now befriended and met with on occasions, said of him: \\"He is a crook, but I like him ... Most politicians still like DeSapio. He always gets the most applause when he is introduced at Democratic dinners\\". Among DeSapio's accomplishments were support of the Fair Employment Practices Law, the New York City rent control laws, and the lowering of the voting age to 18. Death DeSapio died at age 95 on July 27, 2004, at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was interred in a private mausoleum at Calvary Cemetery in Woodside, Queens. He was survived by his daughter Geraldine A. DeSapio.

He is most remembered for his research work in atomic physics and nuclear physics. He is one of the British scientists who participated in the United States' Manhattan Project, Britain's Tube Alloys, and was involved in nuclear weapon development. Moon made outstanding and original experimental contributions which stimulated the development of whole fields of research involving neutrons, gamma rays and novel methods of studying chemical reactions ('Mechanically propelled molecular beams: techniques and opportunities', Moon, P.B. Ralls, M.P., Proceedings of the Royal Society A, 423, 361 371, 1989). Early life and education Philip Burton Moon was born in 1907, attended Leyton Sixth Form College, and in 1925 entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He became a research student in the Cavendish Laboratory under Ernest Rutherford. From 1928 to 1931 he worked with Mark Oliphant on the collision of atoms with solids. Rutherford called him \\"Oliphant's satellite\\" and that influence remained with him for decades. =Cavendish Laboratory= He worked at Cavendish Laboratory in the mid-1930s, where he shared a room with Australian physicist Mark Oliphant. Both later joined the University of Birmingham; Moon in 1938. Tube Alloys and Manhattan Project During World War II Moon was part of the MAUD Committee that confirmed the feasibility of an atomic bomb and then became part of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project, where amongst other things he did work on designing instrumentation for measuring the eventual bomb test. Career at Birmingham University After the war he was made Poynting Professor of Physics at Birmingham in 1946, succeeding Oliphant but receiving the appointment only after the first choice (Cecil Powell) had been rejected at the last minute for being a communist. He held the position until 1973. In 1950 Moon was the first person to detect gamma ray fluorescence; however his results were not considered statistically significant enough and it would be several years before they were proven. Moon was invited to become the honorary life president of the Poynting Physical Society, at the University of Birmingham, in 1975. In 1991, Moon was the recipient of the Hughes Medal from the Royal Society. His papers are held at the University of Birmingham Special Collections. References External links * P. B.

Generally it is used together with dietary changes and a statin. Alone, it is less preferred than a statin. It is taken by mouth. It is also available in the fixed combinations ezetimibe/simvastatin, ezetimibe/atorvastatin, and ezetimibe/rosuvastatin. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections, joint pain, diarrhea, and tiredness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, depression, and muscle breakdown. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. Ezetimibe works by decreasing cholesterol absorption in the intestines. Ezetimibe was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 151st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. Medical uses A 2018 review found that ezetimibe used as sole treatment slightly lowered plasma levels of lipoprotein(a), but the effect was not large enough to be important. A 2015 review found that adding ezetimibe to statin treatment of high blood cholesterol had no effect on overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality, although it significantly reduced the risk of MI and stroke. A 2015 trial found that adding ezetimibe to simvastatin had no effect on overall mortality but did lower the risk of heart attack or stroke in people with prior heart attack. Several treatment guidelines recommend adding ezetimibe in select high risk persons in whom LDL goals cannot be achieved by maximally tolerated statin alone. Ezetimibe is indicated in the United States as an add-on to dietary measures to reduce levels of certain lipids in people with: *Primary hyperlipidemia, alone or with a statin *Mixed hyperlipidemia, in combination with fenofibrate *Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in combination with specific statins *Homozygous sitosterolemia Ezetimibe improves the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score but the available evidence indicates it does not improve outcomes of hepatic steatosis. Contraindications The two contraindications to taking ezetimibe are a previous allergic reaction to it, including symptoms of rash, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, and severe liver disease, especially when taken with a statin.U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Page last updated: 27 October 2014 Medline Plus: Ezetimibe Ezetimibe may have significant medication interactions with ciclosporin and with fibrates other than fenofibrate.Zetia label, Rev 23. Revised: January 2012 Adverse effects Common adverse drug reactions (‚â•1% of patients) associated with ezetimibe therapy include headache and/or diarrhea (steatorrhea). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1‚Äì1% of patients) include myalgia and/or raised liver function test (ALT/AST) results. Rarely (<0.1% of patients), hypersensitivity reactions (rash, angioedema) or myopathy may occur. Cases of muscle problems (myalgia and rhabdomyolysis) have been reported and are included as warnings on the label for ezetimibe. Overdose The incidence of overdose with ezetimibe is rare; subsequently, few data exist on the effects of overdose. However, an acute overdose of ezetimibe is expected to produce an exaggeration of its usual effects, leading to loose stools, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Ezetimibe inhibits the absorption of cholesterol from the small intestine and decreases the amount of cholesterol normally available to liver cells. This leads them to absorb more cholesterol from circulation and thus causes lowering levels of circulating cholesterol. It blocks the critical mediator of cholesterol absorption, the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein on the gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells, as well as in hepatocytes; it blocks aminopeptidase N and interrupts a caveolin 1‚Äìannexin A2 complex involved in trafficking cholesterol. =Pharmacokinetics= Within 4‚Äì12 hours of the oral administration of a 10-mg dose to fasting adults, the attained mean ezetimibe peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 3.4‚Äì5.5 ng/ml. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is absorbed and extensively conjugated to a phenolic glucuronide (active metabolite). Mean Cmax (45‚Äì71 ng/ml) of ezetimibe- glucuronide is attained within 1‚Äì2 hours. The concomitant administration of food (high-fat vs. nonfat meals) has no effect on the extent of absorption of ezetimibe. However, coadministration with a high-fat meal increases its Cmax by 38%. The absolute bioavailability cannot be determined, since ezetimibe is insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection. Ezetimibe and its active metabolites are highly bound to human plasma proteins (90%). Ezetimibe is primarily metabolized in the liver and the small intestine via glucuronide conjugation with subsequent renal and biliary excretion. Both the parent compound and its active metabolite are eliminated from plasma with a half-life around 22 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing. Ezetimibe lacks significant inhibitor or inducer effects on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which explains its limited number of drug interactions. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with chronic kidney disease or mild hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh score 5‚Äì6). Due to insufficient data, the manufacturer does not recommend ezetimibe for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7‚Äì15). In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the mean AUC values for total ezetimibe are increased about 1.7-fold, 3-to-4-fold, and 5-to-6-fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. Cost In the United States, , it costs about per dose. In 2015, it cost between and .

He was the Captain of the merchant ship Mary Celeste, which was discovered unmanned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean midway between the Azores and the coast of Portugal on December 4, 1872. The lifeboat was missing, yet the Mary Celeste herself was still under sail. Benjamin Briggs, his wife Sarah, and their two-year-old daughter Sophia Matilda were never found and are presumed lost, along with the crew of Mary Celeste. Maritime career The Briggs family of Massachusetts had a long maritime connection, and Benjamin Briggs himself spent most of his life at sea. He was an experienced, hardy, and able seaman. He reportedly was respected by those who served under him because of his fairness and ability. He worked his way to eventually become a master mariner. Briggs captained the brigantine Sea Foam, and in 1862 became master of the three-masted schooner Forest King. When he took command of the bark Arthur in 1865, he turned over command of the Forest King to his brother, Oliver Briggs. Oliver Briggs was a frequent business partner and sailor with his brother. Family Benjamin Briggs was devoutly religious and a believer in abstinence. In 1862, he married Sarah Elizabeth Cobb, daughter of the Reverend Leander Cobb. The newlyweds sailed to Europe in Benjamin's schooner Forest King. Their son, Arthur S. Briggs, was born in 1865 at the family home at Rose Cottage, Marion, Massachusetts. The following year, the family travelled to Marseilles, France, returning in time for their daughter, Sophia Matilda Briggs, to be born on October 31, 1870 at Rose Cottage. Mary Celeste In 1871 Briggs and his brother considered giving up the sea and buying a hardware store in New Bedford. In 1872, however, Benjamin Briggs bought a share in the brigantine Mary Celeste, owned by James Winchester, and made modifications to the cabin to house his family. In late 1872, two-year-old Sophia and his wife Sarah accompanied him on the ill-fated voyage from Staten Island, New York, to Genoa, Italy. Their son Arthur stayed with his grandmother at Rose Cottage, Marion, Massachusetts, to attend school. The following month Briggs' ship was found inexplicably abandoned in the Atlantic Ocean near the Straits of Gibraltar. Briggs, his wife and daughter, and the crew of the Mary Celeste were never found. Their fate remains a mystery. Legacy Benjamin Spooner Briggs has living descendants through his son Arthur who was left at home with his grandmother, including Benjamin Yarbrough Briggs, of Boston, Massachusetts and New York City, and John Briggs, of Boston, Massachusetts.The Mystery Of The Mary Celeste: Revealed ABC Television, November 13, 2008 A cenotaph memorializing the family stands in Evergreen Cemetery, Marion, Massachusetts.

It is distinct from a merism, which is a reference to a whole by an enumeration of parts; metonymy, where an object, place, or concept is called by something or some place associated with it; or synecdoche, which can refer both to pars pro toto and its inverse: the whole representing a part. In the context of language, pars pro toto means that something is named after a part or subset of it, or after a limited characteristic, which in itself is not necessarily representative of the whole. For example, \\"glasses\\" is a pars pro toto name for something that consists of more than literally just two pieces of glass (the frame, nosebridge, temples, etc. as well as the lenses). Pars pro toto usage is especially common in political geography, with examples including \\"Russia\\" or \\"Russians\\", used to refer to the entire former Russian Empire or former Soviet Union or its people; Holland for the Netherlands; and, particularly in languages other than English, using the translation of \\"England\\" in that language to refer to the \\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\\". Among English-speakers, \\"Great Britain\\" or \\"Britain\\" is a common pars pro toto shorthand for the entire United Kingdom. Switzerland's name in German (Schweiz) comes from its central Canton of Schwyz. The Apostle Paul employs a pars pro toto designation when he refers to Jews as ‚Äúcircumcised‚Äù and Gentiles as ‚Äúuncircumcised‚Äù (Gal. 2:7‚Äì8).James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 62. The inverse of a pars pro toto is a totum pro parte, in which the whole is used to describe a part, such as the widespread use of \\"America\\" in place of \\"United States of America\\", \\"United States\\", or \\"U.S.\\"; as well as the use, in the United States, of \\"Western Hemisphere\\" to refer to the Americas.

History Seeing the \\"town‚Äôs lack of progress in education,\\" Horace Staples, a wealthy businessman with interests in shipping, hardware sales, and banking, founded Staples High School. Initially Staples intended to fund the school via an interest left in his will; however, that interest became known while he was still alive, and led to the school's foundation being laid in 1884. On April 24, 1884, businesses closed early in Westport to celebrate the dedication of Staples High School. Connecticut Governor Thomas M. Waller attended the opening. Front of Staples High School In the first year of operation, commencing in the fall of 1884, Staples High School had 60 of the 807 students attending schools in Westport. On June 24, 1887, Staples High School conferred its first high school diplomas to six female students who comprised its first graduating class. In 1909 the Town of Westport accepted control of Staples High School from the Horace Staples estate. From 1966 to 1969, Staples attracted some of the biggest names in music to perform in concert. The Animals, Cream, The Yardbirds, The Young Rascals, Sly and the Family Stone and Louis Armstrong to name a few. A short documentary was produced in 2017.

In 1969, aged 39, Milingo was consecrated by Pope Paul VI as the bishop of the Archdiocese of Lusaka. In 1983, he stepped down from his position as Archbishop of Lusaka after criticism for exorcism and faith healing practices unapproved by church authorities. In 2001, when Milingo was 71, he received a marriage blessing from Sun Myung Moon, the leader of the Unification Church, despite the prohibition on marriage for ordained priests. In July 2006, he established Married Priests Now!, an advocacy organization to promote the acceptance of married priests in the Roman Catholic Church. On September 24, 2006, Milingo consecrated four men as bishops without a papal mandate. The Holy See Press Office announced two days later that Milingo had been automatically excommunicated by that act. On December 17, 2009, the Holy See Press Office announced that Milingo had been reduced to the lay state, making him no longer a member of the Catholic clergy. He retired from ministry in his movement for married priests in March 2013, appointing Peter Paul Brennan to take his place. Life and career =Education and ordination= Born in 1930 in Mnukwa (in present-day Zambia) to Yakobe Milingo and Tomaida Lumbiwe, he was educated in St Mary's Presbyterial School in Chipata and attended the Kasina Seminary and Kachebere Seminary. He was ordained a priest in 1958. He was the parish priest in Chipata from 1963 to 1966 and founded the Zambia Helpers' Society during this time. He was the secretary of Mass Media at the Zambia Episcopal Conference from 1966 to 1969 and founded the Daughters of the Redeemer. Pope Paul VI consecrated him as bishop of the Archdiocese of Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. He served there from 1969 to 1983. In the 1970s, Milingo conducted public religious services of healing and exorcism which attracted huge crowds. In 1999 and 2000 Milingo participated in mass-marriage ceremonies conducted by Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church in Japan and Korea, for which he received a severe written reprimand from Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Vatican Secretary of State. In 1983 Pope John Paul II transferred Milingo to Rome for his inappropriate use of his office of exorcism and his role in causing divisions in the Lusaka Archdiocese. He was barred from practicing as a priest and bishop in Zambia, but the Pope appointed Milingo a \\"special delegate\\" of the Pontifical Council for Migrants and Travelers. In 1992, Milingo endorsed the book On the Eucharist, a Divine Appeal, a collection of messages said to have been given by Jesus Christ in an apparition and written from September 8, 1987, to 1991 by Sr. Anna Ali, DOJS. These messages were a traditional call to conversion and eucharistic devotion, as well as expressing sadness over the current state of the Catholic priesthood. Although he did not hold office as a diocesan bishop at the time, his name appears on the book's purported imprimatur with the date March 17, 1992. In the late 1990s, Milingo became well known in traditionalist and sedevacantist circles for a speech he gave at the Our Lady of Fatima 2000 International Conference on World Peace, organized by Canadian priest Nicholas Gruner and held November 18‚Äì23, 1996, in which he charged that high-ranking members of the church hierarchy were \\"followers of Satan\\" or otherwise enabled evil: Marriage In May 2001, Milingo said that the Roman Catholic Church should provide priests dispensation from the obligation of celibacy and should readmit married priests to the priestly ministry. To \\"set an example\\", at the age of 71, he and Maria Sung, a 43-year-old Korean acupuncturist, married in a blessing ceremony in New York City, presided over by Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han Moon. In July 2001, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a Public Canonical Admonition officially warning Milingo to separate from Moon and from contacts with the Unification Church. Milingo protested the order, saying, \\"How can I now leave my wife? For 43 years as a celibate priest I only knew God as a male. Now, through my union with Maria, I have come to see the other side of God's heart, which is female.\\" In a press conference organized by the Unification Church affiliate American Church Leadership Conference, Milingo responded, \\"Celibacy has become a fa√ßade, secret affairs and marriages, raping of nuns, illegitimate children, rampant homosexuality, pedophilia and illicit sex have riddled the priesthood. Christ is mocked, the devil laughs.\\" In August 2001, Milingo met with Pope John Paul II, who appealed to him: \\"In the name of Jesus Christ, return to the Catholic Church.\\" Milingo agreed to separate from Sung and went into seclusion. Sung went on a hunger strike and appeared outside of St. Peter's Basilica to protest their separation. In an interviews on Italian television in 2002, Milingo said that he had spent a year in prayer and meditation in Argentina, at a Capuchin monastery. In November 2003, he made a trip to Africa over the objections of the Catholic bishops there. In 2004 and 2005, he kept a low profile and media accounts suggested that he was living in a monastery near Rome. =Organization for married priests= In late June or early July 2006, Milingo surreptitiously left Italy and on July 12 announced at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., his plans to \\"embark on an independent charismatic ministry to reconcile married priests with the Catholic Faith\\" as an advocate of the removal of the rule of celibacy for Latin Rite priests in the Catholic Church; the group is called Married Priests Now!. The sponsor of the press conference was MJT Television. Archbishop George Augustus Stallings, Jr., also an excommunicated priest, who had founded his own Imani Temple African-American Catholic Congregation, spoke as well. Stallings stated that Milingo \\"is not seeking to defy or divide the (Roman Catholic) Church, but is acting out of deep love for the Church and concern for its future.\\"Archbishop Milingo: 'Married Priesthood Now'; Healer Missing from Italy Emerges in U.S., Proclaims End to Mandatory Celibacy U.S. Newswire Milingo also announced that he wants to bring the Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon closer to the Vatican. He announced he wanted them to cooperate in bringing religion to the world. In August 2006 Milingo rejoined his wife. In January 2010 it was reported that 20 priests in Uganda had formed a breakaway Catholic sect which accepts married priests. This was said to have been inspired by Milingo; the group claims to have around 12,000 members.Twenty Ugandan priests form breakaway sect of married clerics, Catholic News Agency, January 9, 2010 Excommunication On September 24, 2006, Milingo consecrated four married men as bishops, African prelate consecrates married bishops, causing new schism Catholic World News each of whom were already ordained in the Old Catholic line of succession and serving as a bishop in their respective Independent Catholic churches. One of the four was Stallings. The other three were Archbishop Peter Paul Brennan of the Old Catholic Confederation; Archbishop Patrick E. Trujillo of the Old Catholic Church in America, and Archbishop Joseph J. Gouthro of Las Vegas, presiding bishop of the Catholic Apostolic Church International (CACI). Two days after the consecration of the four Americans as bishops, on September 26, 2006, the Holy See's press office announced in a statement that both Milingo and the four men involved in the episcopal consecration had automatically incurred excommunication (see Lat√¶ sententi√¶) in accordance with canon 1382 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law.Glatz, Carol. \\"Vatican says Archbishop Milingo, four others incur excommunication\\", Catholic News Service, September 26, 2006 In October 2007, Milingo's Vatican passport was revoked, ending his status as a person with diplomatic protection from the Vatican City State. Reduction to the lay state In December 2007, in Brazil, Milingo conferred episcopal ordination on Harold J. Norwood. On July 15, 2009, in Massa, Italy, he consecrated Vitaliy Kuzhelnyi, a former priest of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, as a bishop. On December 17, 2009, the Vatican Press Office in a statement announced that Milingo had been dismissed from the clerical state. The statement(In Italian) explained the effect of the action as \\"loss of the rights and duties attached to the clerical state, except for the obligation of celibacy; prohibition of the exercise of any ministry, except as provided for by Canon 976 of the Code of Canon Law in those cases involving danger of death; loss of all offices and functions and of all delegated power, as well as prohibition of the use of clerical attire. Consequently, the participation of the faithful in any future celebrations organized by Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo is to be considered unlawful.\\" On June 11, 2011, the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts issued a statement about illicitly consecrated bishops, pointing out the canons which provide for an automatic latae sententiae excommunication for both the consecrating bishop and those consecrated. Bishop Juan Ignacio Arrieta, Secretary of the Council, explained that the statement applied to the bishops consecrated by Milingo as well as to more recent cases. =Split with US married bishops= In 2009, four bishops consecrated by Milingo withdrew from his organization, distanced themselves from him due to \\"philosophical and theological differences\\", and announced the start of a separate organization to promote the ordination of married men. =Ecumenical Catholic Apostolic Church of Peace= In August 2010, Milingo was named Patriarch for Southern Africa of the new \\"Ecumenical Catholic Apostolic Church of Peace\\", and called for married former Catholic clergy to join the movement. In April 2011 he consecrated the Rev. Peter Njogu as a bishop in Nyeri, Kenya. In 2012, Milingo praised the late Sun Myung Moon for his work to promote religious unity. Milingo retired from ministry in 2013, appointing Archbishop Peter Paul Brennan as his successor. Later that year, he stated that he still considered himself a Roman Catholic.

It entered service in 1944 during the later stages of the war on the Eastern and Western Fronts. The Jagdpanther combined the 8.8 cm Pak 43 cannon, similar to the main gun of the Tiger II, and the armor and suspension of the Panther chassis. During the last stages of the war, limited German production resulted in small production numbers, shortage of spare parts, and shortened crew training periods of younger operators. Development The Jagdpanther was preceded by two attempts at mounting an 8.8 cm gun as a self-propelled anti- tank weapon; Ferdinand using the ninety-one leftover Porsche-built VK 45.01 (P) chassis from the Tiger tank competition it lost to Henschel in 1942, and the Nashorn using a Panzer III/IV chassis. Ferdinand proved to be too heavy, and Nashorn lightly armored and under-powered.AFV Profile No. 10 p17 A heavy tank destroyer design based on the 8.8 cm Pak 43 gun and the Panther tank chassis was ordered in late 1942. The full-size model by Daimler-Benz was demonstrated in October 1943 before Hitler. MIAG-built prototypes followed in October/November 1943. Production started in January 1944; in February, Hitler specified the simpler Jagdpanther name instead of its original \\"8.8 cm Pak 43/3 auf Fahrgestell Panther\\". Front of early production Jagdpanther coated in Zimmerit, Imperial War Museum, London To accommodate the heavier-caliber gun, as on previous Jagdpanzer-style unturreted tank destroyers, the glacis plate and sloped hull sides of the Jagdpanther were extended up into an integral, turretless fixed casemate as part of the main hull to provide a roomy interior. The Jagdpanther had side plate of increased thickness (50 mm) to offset the slightly-reduced angle of the side plate to provide enough interior space. Lower frontal hull plate was reduced to 60 mm while upper hull frontal plate was kept at 80 mm. The chassis armor changes were also introduced on the main Panther tank assembly lines with the Panther Ausf. G in spring 1944. It was armed with the long-barreled 8.8 cm Pak 43/3 L/71 gun, similar to the main gun of the Tiger II \\"King Tiger\\". The gun was mounted in a central mantlet, giving it a limited traverse of twelve-degrees to each side. A single 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun was in a ball mount on the right side of the front glacis plate. The machine gunner was also the radio operator. The driver sat on the left. The gunner had a rangefinder and a periscope telescopic sight. The periscope ‚Äì linked to the gun mount ‚Äì was under an armored housing on the roof. The Jagdpanther had a good power-to-weight ratio and a powerful main gun, enabling crews to destroy any type of Allied tank. Based on the established Panther Ausf G chassis, the vehicle encountered few mechanical problems. It was manned by a crew of five: driver, radio-operator/machine- gunner, commander, gunner, and a loader.AFV Profile No 10 p. 19. Jagdpanther in Northern France. *The two main variants can be distinguished, the earlier G1 1944 model has a small welded main gun mantlet, one piece Pak 43/3 gun, a modified Panther A engine deck, and had two vision openings for the driver. The G2 Jagdpanther used a Panther Ausf. G engine deck, a larger gun mantlet bolted externally (reducing production time?), and a two piece KwK 43/4 L/71 gun. Some later G1 models enjoyed 'hybrid' G2 features such as the larger G2 mantlet as changes to the design were implemented. Zimmerit was applied to G1s up to September 1944, then was withdrawn to decrease production time. Early Jagdpanthers had two vision openings for the driver, whereas late versions had only one. The main gun originally had a monobloc gun barrel, but, May 1944-on, it was gradually replaced by an economical two-part barrel after crews determined barrel wear was uneven. Production and service A total of 415 Jagdpanthers were produced from January 1944 by three manufacturers: MIAG in Braunschweig produced two-hundred seventy from January 1944 until the end of the war, Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen-Hannover (MNH) produced one-hundred twelve from November 1944, Maschinenbau und Bahnbedarf (MBA) in Potsdam produced thirty-seven vehicles from December 1944.Spielberger, p. 196 Planned production was between a hundred and two-hundred a month, but the disruption to German manufacturing made this goal unachievable. The last 'production' Jagdpanthers were produced at the factory by German staff just after the end of World War II under the supervision of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME). Nine Panthers and a dozen Jagdpanthers were produced, then shipped to England for evaluation. A complete Panther and a complete Jagdpanther produced this way are displayed at the Bovington Tank Museum, Dorset, with brass plates on them explaining their history. Jagdpanther equipped heavy antitank battalions (schwere Panzerj√§ger-Abteilungen) and served mainly on the Eastern Front. In the West, they were encountered in very small numbers late in the Battle of Normandy; the German 654 schwere Panzerj√§ger-Abteilung (\\"654th Heavy Antitank Battalion\\") deployed about twelve Jagdpanthers against the British armed forces. Later, significant numbers were concentrated in the West for the Ardennes Offensive. Survivors Jagdpanther at Imperial War Museum (London), from above. Note the three shell holes in the side.

Mitchell in 1957, and first marketed in powdered form in 1959. The Tang brand is currently owned by Mondelƒìz International, a 2012 North American company split off Kraft Foods Inc. Sales of Tang were poor until NASA used it on John Glenn's Mercury flight in February 1962, and on subsequent Gemini missions. Since then it has been closely associated with the U.S. human spaceflight program, which created the misconception that Tang was invented for the space program. History Prepared Tang Tang was used by early NASA manned space flights. In 1962, when Mercury astronaut John Glenn conducted eating experiments in orbit, Tang was selected for the menu; it was also used during some Gemini flights, and has also been carried aboard numerous space shuttle missions. Although many soda companies sent specially-designed canned drinks into space with the crew of STS-51-F, the crew preferred to use Tang, as it could be mixed into existing water containers easily. In 2013, former NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin said, \\"Tang sucks\\". The creator of Tang, William A. Mitchell, also invented Pop Rocks, Cool Whip, a form of instant-set Jell-O, and other convenience foods. (Video.) Tang is noted for their advertising in the 1990s and early 2000s which featured the orangutan as a recurring theme. Original Tang Tang is sold in powdered and liquid-concentrate form. The suggested serving size is two tablespoons, or 31 grams of powdered Original Orange flavored Tang per of water. A single suggested serving of Tang contains of sugar (representing 94% of the product's dry weight); 10% RDA of carbohydrates; 100% RDA of vitamin C; 6% RDA of calcium and has a total of 120 calories (500 kJ). Other versions In 2007, Kraft introduced a new version of Tang which replaced half of the sugar with artificial sweeteners. The new packaging advertises \\"1/2 the sugar of 100% juice\\". The artificial sweeteners used in the new formulation are sucralose, acesulfame potassium, and neotame. The new formula is more concentrated and distributed in smaller containers, with a () making . The recommended usage is two and one-half teaspoons per of water. The lid on the new smaller plastic container acts as a measuring cup which may be used to make one or two quart quantities, the same as the original Tang. In December 2009, the lower calorie Tang was discontinued and is no longer available from Kraft. In 2009, another version of Tang emerged in containers making only .  Economics  Tang is purchased in about thirty-five countries and is available in a variety of flavors depending on where it is being purchased. In the Middle East, more than half of Tang's annual sales happen in just six weeks around Ramadan where many families gather for dinner or an event with a variety of food and they drink Tang. In June 2011, Kraft Foods announced that Tang has become its twelfth billion-dollar brand, with global sales nearly doubling since 2006 and how international Tang markets were pushing hard on their sales. Although the sales of Tang did not come close to Coca-Cola and other sodas and vitamin water sales, they still made good revenue. The brand in 2010 controlled a category-best 15.6% of the international powder concentrate market although, like other highly processed or sweetened beverages, demand in developed economies has stagnated or fallen in line with consumers increasing preference for lower calorie drinks. In 2018, Tang's manufacturer Mondelez reported a drop in sales following the introduction of tax on calorific sweetened beverages in the Philippines.

It is the Philippines' largest entertainment and media conglomerate in terms of revenue, operating income, net income, assets, equity, market capitalization, and number of employees. ABS-CBN was formed by the merger of Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) and Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN). ABS was founded in 1946 by American electronics engineer James Lindenberg as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) with its corporate name, Alto Sales Corporation after Judge Antonio Quirino, brother of President Elpidio Quirino, purchased the company and later launched the first TV station in the country, DZAQ-TV on October 23, 1953. The company that would later be merged with ABS to form ABS-CBN was founded in 1956 as Chronicle Broadcasting Network, Inc. (CBN) by newspaper mogul Eugenio Lopez Sr. and his brother Fernando Lopez, who was then the Vice President of the Philippines. The two companies were soon merged a year later after the Lopezes' acquisition of ABS, reverted to its original name, BEC. Although the ABS-CBN brand was first used on television in 1961, the company became known as ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation a few years later on February 1, 1967 and renamed ABS-CBN Corporation on May 27, 2010 to reflect the company's diversification. The common shares of ABS-CBN were first traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange in July 1992 under the ticker symbol ABS. The group owns and operates the ABS-CBN and ABS-CBN Sports+Action national television networks as well as the Radyo Patrol and My Only Radio regional radio networks. The ABS-CBN television network - in particular, is the largest contributor to the group's revenue, generating about 50 to 60 percent of the group's total annual revenue mainly from selling airtime to advertisers. The remaining revenue is generated from consumer sales, mainly from ABS-CBN Global Ltd., which distributes international television channels such as The Filipino Channel and Myx TV and also from pay TV and broadband internet provider Sky. Other companies which operate under the ABS-CBN group are motion picture company Star Cinema, music recording label Star Music, publishing firm ABS-CBN Publishing, pay TV content provider and distributor Creative Programs, and talent agency Star Magic. Among the pay TV networks and channels under the ABS-CBN group are Kapamilya Channel, TeleRadyo, ABS-CBN HD, ABS-CBN News Channel, ABS-CBN Sports+Action HD, Cinema One, Jeepney TV, Metro Channel, Liga, and Myx. In recent years, ABS-CBN has ventured and diversified in other businesses such as over-the-top platform iWant TFC and Sky On Demand, digital terrestrial television service ABS-CBN TV Plus, family entertainment center Kidzania Manila, and home shopping network O Shopping. ABS-CBN is also the principal owner of the ABS- CBN Philharmonic Orchestra. History =Beginnings= Dewey Boulevard (now Roxas Boulevard), Pasay City, the original headquarters of Alto Broadcasting System. The company was founded on June 13, 1946 as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). BEC was established by James Lindenberg, one of the founding fathers of Philippine television, an American electronics engineer who went into radio equipment assembly and radio broadcasting. At that time, the largest media company was Manila Broadcasting Company (MBC), with DZRH as the leading radio station. In 1949, James Lindenberg shifted Bolinao to radio broadcasting with DZBC and masterminded the introduction of television to the country in 1953. In 1951, Lindenberg partnered with Antonio Quirino, brother of then-Philippine President Elpidio Quirino, in order to try their hand at television broadcasting. In 1952, BEC was renamed as Alto Broadcasting System or ABS (with Alto Sales Corporation as its corporate name). \\"Alto\\" was a contraction of Quirino's and his wife's first names, Tony and Aleli. Though they had little money and resources, ABS was able to put up its TV tower by July 1953 and import some 300 television sets. The initial test broadcasts began on September of the same year. The very first full-blown broadcast was on October 23, 1953, of a party in Tony Quirino's humble abode. The television station was known as DZAQ-TV. =Merger= A short-lived logo used by ABS-CBN from 1963 to 1967. On June 16, 1955, Republic Act No. 1343 signed by President Ramon Magsaysay granted the Manila Chronicle its broadcasting franchise, leading to the formation of the Chronicle Broadcasting Network. In turn, on September 24, 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) was founded. The network, which initially focused only on radio broadcasting, was owned by Eugenio Lopez Sr. and the then- Philippine Vice President Fernando Lopez, and later on launched its very own TV station, DZXL-TV 9 on April 19 (or July), 1958. On February 24, 1957, Don Eugenio acquired ABS from Quirino and Lindenberg. However, it was only on February 1, 1967, that the corporate name was changed to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation to reflect the merger. Before, it was named ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, the name was reverted to the precursor of the network, Bolinao Electronics Corporation or BEC, but the ABS- CBN brand was first used in 1961. In 1958, the network's new headquarters at Roxas Boulevard were inaugurated, and all radio and television operations were consolidated into its two buildings, the radio stations at the Chronicle Building at Aduana Street, Intramuros, Manila, and the TV operations at the brand new Roxas Boulevard building in Pasay City. In the late 1950s, Don Eugenio's son, Geny Lopez, saw the potential of TV and radio to reach and link Filipinos across the archipelago. By the mid-1960s, the ABS-CBN network was leading the radio industry, with stations like DZXL and DZAQ Radyo Patrol in the Manila area, which featured journalists like Ernie Baron, Bong Lapira, Orly Mercado, Joe Taruc, Mario Garcia, Jun Ricafrente, Bobby Guanzon, and Rey Langit, and various other stations nationwide. ABS-CBN also made breakthroughs in the TV industry by achieving the country's first color TV broadcast, first satellite feed broadcasts (during remarkable events including the Apollo 11 moon landing, the collapse of Ruby Tower in Manila during the 1968 Casiguran earthquake, assassination and funeral of Robert F. Kennedy and the 1968 United States presidential election), and first use of videotape, among others. It featured top shows then, such as Your Evening with Pilita and Tawag ng Tanghalan, the country's first comedy show Buhay Artista, first Philippine game show, What's My Living and the first noontime show Student Canteen, among others. It was also pioneering in marathon election coverage in 1967 when the TV & radio stations of the network aired election updates for 36 hours sharp ‚Äì making it a national first. ABS-CBN logo (February 1, 1967 ‚Äì September 21, 1972), (Print version) for 1986-December 31, 1999 still used in the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center's facade. On June 15, 1961, Eugenio Lopez Jr. built the first provincial TV station in Cebu (based in Mandaue) airing 4 hours with the tallest transmitter tower (in that time) measuring 216 feet. Within weeks, another TV station in Dagupan opened its doors followed by the first broadcasts in Negros Island (through Bacolod) in 1963. Panay had its first station in Iloilo City which opened in 1964, the Soccsksargen region then followed up with the opening of its own regional station in 1965 and Baguio and Davao both followed suit in 1967. Two years later, the network's first test color broadcasts began with the help of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). Color broadcasts started in June 1966, the first in the Philippines and Southeast Asia as the network was tagged as the First in Color Television, with full-color broadcasting beginning in 1971 in all national television stations. On December 18, 1968, ABS-CBN opened its new Broadcast Center on Bohol Avenue (renamed as Sgt. Esguerra Avenue in 1989), Quezon City, where it still stands today. At the time, it was the most advanced facility of its kind in Asia. The station again made breakthroughs by using the first live satellite transmissions from abroad, foremost of which was the first moon landing in 1969 and the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico the year before. The network enjoyed a big portion of the ratings and won various awards and recognitions from different organizations. The network pioneered the first all-national news simulcasts also in the same year as well. By 1972, the ABS- CBN network owned and operated two television stations and seven radio stations in Manila, 14 radio stations and three television stations in the provinces. =Martial law era= The company suffered a setback for the first time upon the declaration of martial law by Ferdinand Marcos. On September 23, 1972, two days after the signing of Proclamation No. 1081, ABS-CBN and its affiliate stations were seized. Eugenio Lopez Jr., the president of the company, was arrested in November 1972, then imprisoned and held without trial for five years until he and his cellmate Sergio Osme√±a III launched a daring jailbreak on October 1, 1977 and taken exile in the United States together with their families. The general manager of ABS-CBN, Almeda Lopez, was also imprisoned for a year for his protest activities. After his daring and successful escape from Fort Bonifacio, he joined Geny in exile in the United States and kept himself busy protesting the Marcos dictatorship from abroad. He was a key figure in the protest over the Bataan nuclear power plant. The network itself was taken over by Roberto Benedicto, a crony of Ferdinand Marcos, Philippines' ambassador to Japan and sugar plantation owner, who used the Broadcasting Center at Bohol Avenue, then renamed as \\"Broadcast Plaza\\", as the home of Government Television/Maharlika Broadcasting System (GTV/MBS, originally from Intramuros) and Kanlaon Broadcasting System/Radio Philippines Network (KBS/RPN, after the studio in Pasay had been destroyed by a fire on June 6, 1973). Channel 2 would later be relaunched as the Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on November 4, 1973, with a completely new logo, slogan, and a theme song from Jose Mari Chan entitled \\"Big Beautiful Country\\" and sung by various artists. BBC later moved to new headquarters (together with RPN and the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation [IBC]) in Broadcast City (also in Diliman, Quezon City) in 1978, while the Channel 4 frequency of DZXL-TV was taken over by the government agency National Media Production Center (NMPC) for the launch of Government Television (GTV) as DWGT-TV on February 2, 1974. The network's radio stations were also affected with BBC and KBS/RPN operating several of the stations. =Capture of Broadcast Plaza (MBS-4)= At the height of the People Power Revolution, military reformists, believing that television would be a powerful tool to aid the revolution, attacked and took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center on February 24, 1986, former ABS-CBN talents put the station back on the air and televised the drama of the unfolding uprising, thereby contributing to the strength of the revolt. BBC, on the other hand, ceased operations after reformists shut down its transmitter in Panay Avenue (together with RPN and IBC, temporarily) on the following day as the Channel 2 frequency was turned over to the Lopezes on July 16, 1986.EDSA People Power Revolution Day 4 retrieved October 31, 2014 =Rebirth and growth= ABS-CBN logo (September 14, 1986 ‚Äì December 31, 1999) (Color version) On March 1, 1986, after the People Power Revolution, Geny Lopez returned to the country after self-exile in the United States and started rebuilding from what was left of the station after the revolution. Recovery was difficult and resources were low, hence, former ABS-CBN employees Freddie Garc√≠a, Ben Aniceto and Rolly Cruz were brought in to rework the station's programming, and the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) ordered the return of ABS-CBN to its original owners on June 13, 1986, thus, the channel began to rebroadcast to viewers once again starting September 14 of the same year. Aniceto, who worked as the program director for radio and television of the network and station manager of Channel 2 in the 1970s, was served as the first vice president and general manager of ABS-CBN upon the network's reopening from 1986 to 1987 and its radio stations re- opened in July 1986. On March 1, 1987, Channel 2 was relaunched with the live musical special, The Star Network: Ang Pagbabal√≠k Ng Bituin (The Return of the Star) which noted for the then-brand-new numerical white tri-ribbon channel 2 logo with a white rhomboidal star (from 1988 to 1993 the ribbons were tri- coloured in red, green and blue) as a centerpiece of the network's revival. By 1988, ABS-CBN had regained its foothold in the Philippine TV ratings from dead last (#5) to being number 1 again nationally - as a result of the rebranding. Within the year, ABS-CBN also beefed up its news programs with TV Patrol, anchored by a team of newsreaders composed of now-former Vice President Noli de Castro, Mel Tiangco, Frankie Evangelista, and Angelique Lazo, with the late Ernie Baron telling the daily weather forecast. Other reputable news programmes followed, such as Magandang Gabi, Bayan as well as the cultural magazine show Tatak Pilipino hosted by the former anchor Gel Santos-Relos and former APO Hiking Society member Jim Paredes, and Hoy Gising!. The entertainment programs of ABS-CBN were also revamped with series that previously aired on RPN and IBC, which included Eat Bulaga!, Okey Ka Fairy Ko!, The Sharon Cuneta Show, Chika Chika Chicks, Goin' Bananas, Loveliness, Kapag May Katwiran, Ipaglaban Mo!, and Coney Reyes on Camera, while producing original content (initially co-productions with Regal Television), which included The Maricel Soriano Drama Special, Ryan Ryan Musikahan, Ang TV, Sa Linggo nAPO Sila, Showbiz Lingo, Oki Doki Doc, Mara Clara, Maalaala Mo Kaya, Palibhasa Lalake, Teysi ng Tahanan, Home Along Da Riles, and Wansapanataym. Another feature of its return to the top of the ratings is the introduction of the live-action sentai and tokusatsu show formats from Japan, with Bioman, Goggle V Gavan and Shaider, the latter the first ever tokusatsu program to be aired in English and Filipino to Philippine television full-time (after a brief appearance on RPN). Filipino-dubbed anime programmes, another network and Philippine television first, would only begin in the transition to the 1990s, and 1987's Hikari Sentai Maskman, aired by the network, was first ever sentai program to dub in Filipino. Within months after the relaunch in Manila, the revived network also restarted regional programs and broadcasting starting in Baguio, Cebu, Bacolod, and Davao (and later in Zamboanga and Cagayan de Oro). Within the 1990s, the network also helped open new stations in other parts of the country, while reopening stations that were used before. On December 11, 1988 with the first marathon broadcast of the Australian produced television miniseries A Dangerous Life, ABS-CBN began shifting to satellite broadcast, enabling the entire country to watch the same programs simultaneously. This was also the very year when the network began international broadcasts to Guam and Saipan, in the Northern Marianas, also via satellite, yet another first for Philippine and Asian television. At the same time, the network began to increase the number of local TV programs being aired and produced. Slowly, the station inched its way to financial recovery, which it achieved by 1990, regularly garnering around 70% of the market. In 1992, ABS-CBN Talent Center (now Star Magic) was formed and in 1993, ABS-CBN launched Star Cinema as the company began to diversify. In 1995, Star Records (now Star Music) was launched. In that year, ABS-CBN also launched their own website, ABS-CBN.com, the first Filipino television network in the World Wide Web. It was created by its IT department, Internet Media Group. (IMG, which later became ABS-CBN Interactive until its merger in 2015) On March 30, 1998, ABS-CBN Holdings Corporation was incorporated as Worldtech Holdings Corporation, for the primary purpose of issuance of the Philippine Depository Receipt (PDR) and the acquisition and holding of shares of ABS-CBN Corporation. Its Philippine depository receipt (PDR) is traded in the Philippine Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ABSP. Nine years after the revival on March 30, 1995, Republic Act No. 7966 signed by President Fidel Ramos granted ABS-CBN its legislative franchise for the second time. Geny Lopez died of cancer on June 29, 1999, in the United States. This happened six months before the network celebrated the millennium by unveiling a new logo and inaugurating its Millennium Transmitter in the corporation grounds, resulting in a clearer signal for its television and radio stations in Mega Manila. In 2002, Finance Asia ranked ABS-CBN as the 8th best-managed company in the Philippines in its \\"Asia's Best Companies 2002\\" survey. The survey covers the performance of the top companies in 10 countries in Asia. Finance Asia polled institutional investors and equity analysts for this survey. On May 27, 2010, the conglomerate dropped the word \\"Broadcasting\\" from its corporate name, changing it from \\"ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation\\" to simply \\"ABS-CBN Corporation.\\" According to Eugenio Lopez, Chairman of ABS-CBN Corporation, \\"It is a response to the changes in the media landscape brought about by technology. The media business has gone beyond merely broadcasting to encompass other platforms.\\" =Expansion= Since the 1990s, ABS-CBN has expanded into various successful media and entertainment ventures such as talent development and management with Star Magic, film, television production and distribution with Star Cinema, music and video recording, publishing, and distribution with Star Music, print and publishing with ABS-CBN Publishing, new media with ABS-CBN Digital Media, pay TV with Creative Programs, international television distribution with ABS-CBN Global, telecommunications with ABS-CBN Convergence, San Francisco International Gateway, and Sky Cable, sports programming with ABS-CBN Sports, post-production with RoadRunner, which was dissolved in 2013, home TV shopping with O Shopping, and theme park with Play Innovations. On September 24, 1994, ABS-CBN signed a historic deal with PanAmSat to bring the first trans-Pacific Asian programming to some two million Filipino immigrants in the United States. This deal would later gave birth to The Filipino Channel which is now available globally. The company has also syndicated its programs for international audience through its ABS-CBN International Distribution division. Among the programs that gained popularity abroad are Pangako Sa 'Yo, Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay, Lobo, Sana Maulit Muli, Kahit Isang Saglit, and Be Careful With My Heart. ABS-CBN had a failed venture in online gaming industry in the Philippines through its now-defunct subsidiary ABS-CBN Multimedia, Inc. The subsidiary was the owner of Get Amped and Amped Casual Games, the Philippine operator of Tantra Online, War Rock, Cronous, Ragnarok Online, and PopCap Games. Another failed venture was the 5 million dollar deal with the now defunct social network site Multiply. In 2005, ABS-CBN International acquired the Richmond, California-based telecommunications port company San Francisco International Gateway from Loral Space & Communications. San Francisco International Gateway provides satellite communications services through its 2.5-acre facility consisting of 19 satellite dish antennas and 9 modular equipment buildings. In 2007, ABS-CBN International launched Myx TV, the first and the only Asian-American youth music channel in the United States and aired the animated series The Nutshack. It was later reformatted in 2011 to become a general entertainment channel targeted to the Asian-Americans. In 2008, ABS-CBN International opened its state-of-the-art studio in Redwood City, California. =The Kapamilya network= ABS-CBN logo (January 1, 2000 ‚Äì December 31, 2013) In 2003, during the 50th anniversary of Philippine television, ABS-CBN launched its present brand name, \\"Kapamilya\\" (literally means \\"a member of the family\\").

The company also did a nationwide caravan, showcasing the network's talents. On October 19, 2003, the network held a month-long celebration of ABS-CBN and Philippine TV's 50th year. The station produced two commemorative documentaries about the station's contribution in news and entertainment. Sa Mata ng Balita encapsulated some of the most unforgettable, most remarkable, and most celebrated landmarks of the last 50 years, as captured by television news. 50 Taong Ligawan: The Pinoy TV History, on the other hand, was the first extensive television documentary done about the history of Philippine television and the evolution of Philippine entertainment. =Recent developments= The ELJ Communications Center and the newly renovated Millennium Transmitter as viewed from Mother Ignacia Avenue In 2008, ABS-CBN celebrated the 55th year of Philippine television. A new station ID entitled \\"Beyond Television\\" was also launched. The anniversary TV plug depicts the growth of ABS-CBN from a small television station that started in 1953 into a media conglomerate that has businesses beyond television. It is also on this year that The Wall Street Journal Asia ranked ABS-CBN as the 7th most admired company of the Philippines and 3rd in the Innovation Award category for its innovation in internet TV with the now-defunct TFC Now! service.

Gabby Lopez will be the second executive to be elected as Chairman Emeritus, succeeding his late father, Eugenio \\"Geny\\" Lopez, Jr. On February 10, 2020, it was announced that Solicitor General Jose Calida has submitted a petition to the Philippine Supreme Court to end ABS-CBN's franchise due to allegations that foreigners were allowed to be involved in the company's ownership. Horizon IT Park In 2011, ABS-CBN announced the development of a state-of-the-art studio complex in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, which is on par with Hollywood standards for a projected cost of 6 to 7.5 billion pesos. A 120 hectare lot in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan was acquired earlier that year for 75 million pesos. In 2014, it was announced that the studio complex will consist of 10 sound stages and backlots each. The company plan to build at least two sound stages a year for a cost of 600 million pesos or 300 million pesos for each sound stage. The proper of the project started in the first quarter of 2014 with its construction commenced in May 2017. The production and support teams for both TV and feature films began a three-year training program for the stages both in Hollywood and the Philippines to ensure that production processes mirror the best practices in the world. On December 12, 2018, after years of planning and training, ABS-CBN inaugurated its new state-of-the-art studio complex which is revealed to be called Horizon IT Park.

The new studios will be used for the upcoming teleserye The Faithful Wife, and its most anticipated movie, Darna. A new soundstage was finally used for its reality singing competition show, Idol Philippines, using the name as \\"Idol City\\". =Franchise renewal= Nine years after the revival on March 30, 1995, Republic Act No. 7966 signed by President Fidel Ramos granted ABS-CBN its legislative franchise for the second time. In 2014, ABS-CBN said it had opted for an early renewal application in September 2014 and \\"went through the normal legislative process.\\" But it later withdrew its application \\"due to time constraints. Several bills has been filed on the congress to seek franchise renewal since 2016 but remain pending to date. President Rodrigo Duterte, in a chance interview, said he would formally block the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise after accusing the company of \\"swindling.\\" Duterte said the network failed to air his campaign ad before the 2016 polls and then failed to return the money. 2020 order to cease broadcasting On May 5, 2020, the National Telecommunications Commission legally ordered ABS-CBN to cease its free TV and radio broadcasting after their 25-year broadcast franchise expired the previous day. Media watchdogs have accused the Duterte administration of muzzling press freedom under the pretense that ABS-CBN had violated laws in the country. The station officially signed off on 7:52pm, local time. On June 13, 2020, ABS-CBN's Kapamilya Channel the cable-and- satellite channel has launched, resuming the production of ABS-CBN's drama and live entertainment shows and airing its entertainment, educational and current affairs programming, along with films. On June 30, 2020, the NTC issued an alias cease and desist order to ABS-CBN to stop its digital TV transmission on Channel 43 in Metro Manila, as well as a cease and desist order to stop Sky Cable's direct broadcast satellite service Sky Direct.https://www.rappler.com/nation/265299-ntc-orders-sky-cable-stop- operating-satellite-tv-service On July 10, 2020, members of the House of Representatives, particularly the Committee on Legislative Franchises, voted 70‚Äì11 to deny the franchise application of ABS-CBN, citing several issues on the network's franchise. Only about 12.94% of the Congress voted for franchise renewal. Its President and CEO, Carlo Katigbak said the company remains committed to the public service, with hoping to find other ways to pursue their mission. A Social Weather Stations survey, released following the rejection of the network's franchise renewal, showed that an overwhelming majority (75%) of all Filipinos want the network back. As a result, ABS-CBN Corporation is forced to cease the operations of some of its businesses and lay off its workers on August 31, 2020. On September 10, 2020, the National Telecommunications Commission issued an order to recall all frequencies of the network as it no longer obtains a valid congressional franchise to continue operating as it is disqualified from operating.  A2Z Channel  On October 6, 2020, the company announced that they will air its shows and movies back on Free TV via the new \\"A2Z\\" channel starting October 10, 2020. It is a blocktime agreement between the corporation and ZOE Broadcasting Network. Branding The logo of Alto Broadcasting System (1953‚Äì1967). The logo of Chronicle Broadcasting Network (1956‚Äì1967). The ABS-CBN logo features three main elements, the vertical line rooted on a horizontal origin, the three extending circles, and the text ABS-CBN. The vertical line or bar represents a tower (broadcasting tower) as well as dignifying the company and representing its core business of broadcasting, with the circles symbolizing a transmitter tower's signals, and representing the red, green and blue or RGB colors which makes up a pixel shown on the television. The 3 divisions of the Philippines, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, are also denoted by the three circles, as well as its wide presence, \\"range for imagination\\", and its \\"pioneering, embracing\\" spirit. One unique thing about ABS-CBN's logo is that it also has a horizontal version, usually used to save space as the main vertical logo usually takes up more space than the horizontal one. The design of the horizontal version of the logo contains the ABS-CBN text, split into two parts, \\"ABS\\" and \\"CBN\\", without the dash connecting them, and ABS-CBN's iconic symbol squeezed in between them. The first logo to have a horizontal version going by this design was the logo launched in 1986, the year they re-launched their operations after 14 years of hibernation under martial law and Marcos' authoritarian rule. From 1986 up until 2014, the elements of the horizontal logo, text, and symbol were evenly sized. In the 2014 version of the horizontal logo, the symbol of ABS-CBN was squeezed in between was slightly larger than the ABS (Alto Broadcasting System) and CBN (Chronicle Broadcasting Network) names. =Channel 2= Since 1969, the network has started using a channel logo beginning on DZAQ-TV with the early channel 2 logo for use as a promotion from 1969 to 1972 as The Family Channel. The frequency was later awarded to BBC as DWWX-TV from 1973 to 1986, and had a different logo used. Channel 2 is currently used as the frequency of the flagship station of ABS-CBN in Metro Manila. ABS-CBN introduced an innovation to the channel 2 logo from 1986 to 1992. At first, the channel 2 logo is introduced into ABS-CBN, after the dissolution of BBC in March. The features of the first channel 2 logo is a wing-shaped blue crest with a white curve at the top and a white line as a tail, the Broadway 2 logo was used from 1986 to 1987. It has a slogan name Watch Us Do It Again! as the station ID aired since the network's revival. After six months of carefully selected plans, the first tri-ribbon 2 logo laced with a rhomboidal star came to being on March 1, 1987. The tri-ribbon 2 logo's color is white carried the slogan The Star Network when it aired as a station ID to reclaim the dominance in TV ratings, using the Scanimate system that it took over from the private-owned BBC-2. By 1988, the ribbons in the tri-ribbon 2 logo were changed into red, green and blue stripes from the three white stripes it first used. Truly, the tri-ribbon 2 logo was accidentally coming from a shooting star in the form of the number 2 in the idents which came out. Similarly, most numerical channel logos within this slogan have a star and versions came into regional TV channels like 3 (DYCB-TV in Cebu and D-3-ZO-TV in Baguio), 4 (DYXL-TV in Bacolod and DXAS-TV in Davao) and other regional stations. The tri-ribbon 2 was also used on microphone flags until the early 2000s. =Sarimanok= The Sarimanok, a legendary bird in Philippine folklore, was first used in 1966 to identify color broadcasts, somewhat similar on how the NBC peacock has been utilized. In 1993, which happens to be the Chinese Year of the Rooster, ABS-CBN relaunched the Sarimanok with a new station ID featuring the legendary bird. The Sarimanok ID became utmostly associated with the channel that ABS-CBN opted it to become the station's mascot. ABS-CBN later named its new 24-hour news channel the Sarimanok News Network, the precursor of the ABS-CBN News Channel. It was revived again in 2004 to promote regional broadcasts nationwide. =Evolution of ABS-CBN logos= The logo of pre-merger Alto Broadcasting System had a symbol composed of a transmitter with a circle denoting its signals, a precursor of sorts to ABS-CBN's current logos. The logo of pre-merger Chronicle Broadcasting Network, on the other hand, had three blocks and the CBN letters in them. In 1961, the ABS-CBN brand was introduced and its first logo had a big letter B, unifying the names ABS and CBN, in a box placed between their channel numbers 3 (ABS' DZAQ-TV) and 9 (CBN's DZXL-TV). A modified version of ABS symbol was launched in 1963, composed of a triangle denoting a transmitter tower and four circles denoting its signals (in the same vein as the 1953 logo), enclosed in a rounded box and with the ABS-CBN text above, in a form that would evolve over the years to the present-day logo. The logo soon after took on its current iteration: a vertical line, denoting a transmitter tower, with three concentric circles signifying Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, enclosed in a square frame, in 1967. The new logo became identical and inspired by the logo of the former German broadcaster and ARD member Sender Freies Berlin (SFB) based in Berlin. At that time, it was rendered in black and white because color TV (despite the fact that it was ABS-CBN that introduced it the previous year) wasn't common yet and the logo style at that time separated ABS and CBN's names, putting ABS' name on top and CBN's on the bottom. The network used a colored variation of the 1967 logo when color television introduced and they re-launched operations in 1986, after 14 years of forced closure under martial law. The logo had the three rings detached from the transmitter and colored the three rings in red, green, and blue, and substituted the square frame with an outlined black box. The RGB-colored logo has remained relatively unchanged since then, though two modifications in 1993 (the 40th anniversary of Philippine TV) and 1996 (ABS-CBN's 50th corporate anniversary) saw minor tweaks in the letters, the rings and the box. January 1, 2000 (the first day of the new millennium) saw a significantly revamped version of the logo. In this version, the outlined black box that enclosed the three rings and the vertical line (that maintained their 1996 design) was replaced by a grey square (a crystal plane when rendered in 3D) and the ABS and CBN names joined together to form ABS-CBN's name, now situated below the symbol. The ABS-CBN letters were also given a completely revamped look. The present logo, launched in 2014, is a minimally altered version of the 2000 logo, greatly modifying the \\"ABS-CBN\\" text, dropping the once-standard serifs on the letters, giving the three RGB rings thicker width and perfected concentricity, and adopting a white square instead of a black or grey one. The rebranding aims to maintain the iconic structure of ABS-CBN's logo while at the same time giving it a new look suited for a period of popularity for social and digital media.

Life Stevens was born at Castle Point, Hoboken, New Jersey, the son of Colonel John Stevens III (1749‚Äì1838) and his wife Rachel (n√©e Cox) Stevens (1761‚Äì1839). He was the sixth of eleven children, and among his older brothers were John Cox Stevens and Robert Livingston Stevens. Career At an early age Stevens was entrusted by his father with the family business affairs, and in 1821 at the age of 26 he assumed full responsibility for the Stevens estate in Hoboken and other properties. Also in 1821, he developed the \\"Jeef Beef,\\" a cast-iron plow with a curved moldboard and replaceable heel piece. The plow was popular among New Jersey farmers. He went on to design many other technological innovations, such as the ‚ÄúBeef Clothes‚Äù for New York City; the \\"closed fireroom‚Äù system of forced draft for his family's steamboat fleet; and the \\"vestibule car\\" for the Camden and Amboy Railroad.Allen, Oliver E. \\"The First Family of Inventors\\" , Invention & Technology Magazine, Fall 1987. Following the death of Colonel Stevens in 1838, Edwin and his brother Robert worked on a commission from the United States government to construct the nation's first ironclad naval vessel. After conducting tests to determine the amount of armor a vessel needed to defend itself against naval guns, the two brothers constructed a huge vessel known as the Stevens Battery. Though the craft was never fully completed, it nevertheless laid the groundwork for the modern armored warship. A scaled-down version, the USRC Naugatuck, saw limited action in the Civil War. After the war, the Naugatuck and the Battery were sold for scrap. Stevens was part of the syndicate from the New York Yacht Club that built and raced the schooner-yacht America. His brother, John Cox Stevens, was the head of the syndicate and the NYYC's first Commodore. Edwin Augustus also served as Commodore of the NYYC, resigning in 1866. Personal life In 1836, he married Mary Barton Picton (1806‚Äì1842), daughter of Rev. Thomas Picton of Princeton, New Jersey. Together, they had a daughter: * Mary Picton Stevens (1840‚Äì1903), who married Virginia politician Muscoe Russell Hunter Garnett (1821‚Äì1864). After his death, she married Edward Parke Custis Lewis (1837‚Äì1892), U.S. Minister to Portugal. In 1854, after his first wife's death, Stevens married Martha Bayard Dod (1831‚Äì1899), the daughter of Albert Baldwin Dod, a professor of mathematics at Princeton University, and Caroline Smith (n√©e Bayard) Dod, who was the daughter of Samuel Bayard and granddaughter of Continental Congressman John Bubenheim Bayard. With Martha he had seven children: * John Stevens IV (b. 1856), grandfather of Millicent Fenwick * Edwin Augustus Stevens, Jr. (1858‚Äì1918), who married Emily Contee Lewis (1857‚Äì1931), the great-granddaughter of Lawrence Lewis, George Washington's nephew, and Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis, Washington's adopted daughter and step-granddaughter. * Caroline Bayard Stevens (b. 1859), who married Archibald Alexander and then H. Otto Wittpenn * Julia Augusta Stevens (b. 1863)http://hoboken.pastperfect- online.com/32340cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=0989D36E-E9D0-484C-BF1D-305114402712;type=301 * Robert Livingston Stevens II (b. 1864) * Charles Albert Stevens (b. 1865) * Richard Stevens (1868‚Äì1919), a Columbia College and Columbia Law School graduate who served as president of the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company. Stevens died in Paris, France on August 8, 1868. =Legacy= In Steven's will, he left the bulk of his fortune to his wife and children, but also donated land adjoining the Stevens family estate, as well as $150,000 for the erection of a building and $500,000 as an endowment for the establishment of an \\"institution of learning\\". Because of the Stevens family's close ties with engineering, the will's executors decided it would be an institution devoted to the \\"mechanical arts\\". This institution became Stevens Institute of Technology, which opened its doors in 1870. The university has since expanded to an entire hilltop campus overlooking Manhattan, but the original building funded by Stevens' bequest is still in use: Edwin A. Stevens Hall continues to house much of the School of Engineering, the university's oldest school (there are now four).
