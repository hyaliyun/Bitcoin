The British captured her in 1806 and renamed her HMS Pelican. She was sold in 1812. Capture In late 1805, the sister ships and Voltigeur, both armed with 16 guns and having crews of 120 men and 115 men, were under the command of Lieutenants de vaisseau Louis-Henri Saulces de Freycinet and Jacques Saint- Cricq. They cruised the coasts of Schleswig-Holstein before they set sail for Santo Domingo. On 24 March, a little south-east of Puerto Rico, they encountered and exchanged fire for about four hours before nightfall ended the encounter. During that engagement the French vessels had suffered damage and possibly casualties. They then sailed towards Curacoa. ) Two days later, on 27 March 1806, , under the command of Captain Charles B.H. Ross, was sailing from Santo Domingo to Curacoa when she encountered two French navy brigs. At 1pm, Pique began firing at long range, and by 2pm had caught up with them. After an intensive cannonade that lasted some 20 minutes, Pique was able to send a boarding party aboard one of the two French vessels. A terrible struggle ensued before the French vessel struck. The French crew had concealed themselves under sails and in the wreckage, emerging once the boarding party arrived and subjecting it to a devastating fusillade that killed or wounded most of the boarding party. Ross then sent over more men, before returning to the chase of the second brig.James (1837), Vol. 4, pp. 226-7. After the exchange of several more broadsides, the second French vessel struck. The two French brigs were Phaeton and Voltigeur. Pique had one man wounded during the chase, and nine men killed and 13 wounded during the boarding of Phaeton. Ross estimated that the French vessels had lost half their crews dead and wounded. Later reports suggested that although French casualties on Phaeton had been heavy, those on Voltigeur were slight. The British took Phaeton into service as Mignonne, and Voltigeur as Pelican. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Pique 26 March 1806\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. British service The British commissioned Pelican under Commander William Ward. She then sailed to Portsmouth. Pelican participated in the capture of Copenhagen. Before the battle, on 19 August, Pelican captured the Danish merchant vessel Christian Tonder. Then after the battle, on 10 September, Pelican was in company with and at the capture of the Danish merchant vessel Fredeus Forsward. Pelican and Comus were together on 29 September, with Defence in sight, at the capture of the Danish merchant vessel Elizabeth Vonder Pahlen. The same three British warships were together on 2 October at the capture of the Danish vessel Anna Catharina. Lastly, on 4 November Pelican captured the Danish brig Charlotta Amelia. On 26 October 1807, Tsar Alexander I of Russia declared war on Great Britain. The official news did not arrive there until 2 December, at which time the British declared an embargo on all Russian vessels in British ports. Pelican was one of some 70 vessels that shared in the seizure of the 44-gun Russian frigate Speshnoy (Speshnyy), then in Portsmouth harbour. The British seized the Russian storeship Wilhelmina (Vilghemina) at the same time. The Russian vessels were carrying the payroll for Vice-Admiral Dmitry Senyavin‚Äôs squadron in the Mediterranean. Between 20 March and 13 June 1807 Pelican was in Portsmouth, undergoing refitting. Pelican then returned to the West Indies where on 29 March 1808 , in company with Lilly, Pelican, , and , sailed from Marie-Galante to attack the island of La D√©sirade. They arrived on 30 March and sent in a landing party of seamen and marines from the vessels of the squadron, all under the overall command of Captain Sherriff of Lily. As the boats approached they exchanged fire with a battery of 9-pounder guns covering the entrance to the harbour. The ships' guns silenced the battery and the French surrendered. In June 1808 Commander Isaac Morrison replaced Ward. In December Commander Edward A‚ÄôCourt replaced Morrison. On 9 December 1809, was some nine leagues from Beachy Head when she sighted two luggers. She gave chase and after a fight captured one. While this was going on Pelican came on the scene and chased the second lugger, but without success. The captured lugger was the Grand Rodeur, four days out of Dieppe. She was armed with 16 guns and had a crew of 80. In 1809 Pelican was in the western hemisphere, where she detained the President, Burgeis, master, which was sailing from Boston to Cuba.Lloyd's List 31 March 1809, ‚Ññ434. Fate Pelican was paid off in 1810. She was put up for sale on 27 November 1811, and sold at Deptford on 16 March 1812.

The school took its name from its initial location in the Llotja de Mar palace; it was moved in 1967 to its current location at 17 Ciutat de Balaguer Street. (It also has a satellite location at 40 Padre Manyanet Street in the San Andreu neighborhood.)

The school's classes were totally free. Furthermore, scholarships allowed many students to travel to Madrid and other European centers like Rome and Paris for studies, where they typically dedicated themselves to copying grand masters' works, which was a common method of study in that era. The school's focus evolved toward the fine arts and in 1778 its name was changed to Fine Arts School (Escola de Nobles Arts). In 1790, the school expanded with satellite locations in Olot, Palma de Mallorca, T√†rrega, Girona, Saragossa, and Haca. The school organized its first exhibition in 1786 of prize-winning student work; in the next year's exhibition, other non- student artworks were also displayed.Judit Subirachs i Burgaya, (1994), L'Escultura del segle XIX a Catalunya Publicacions de l'Abadia de Montserrat, In 1850, the school became dependent on the Acad√®mia Provincial de Belles Arts, with the new name Provincial School of Fine Art (Escola Provincial de Belles Arts).

Despite the lack of an express right, privacy is the foundation for many of the rights contained within NZBORA, such as freedom from unreasonable search and seizure as protected by section 21.New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, s 21; Steven Penk and Rosemary Tobin, Privacy Law in New Zealand at 18. The fact that a right to privacy is not included in NZBORA does not affect or invalidate it in any way.New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 28. It is suggested that privacy was not included in NZBORA due to its difficulty to define, and because the social environment at the time was not one in which it was appropriate to implement a right with vague and uncertain parameters.Hosking v. Runting [2005] 2 NZLR 1 at [92]-[94]. The current Privacy Commissioner, John Edwards =Privacy Act 1993= New Zealand has a statute entitled the Privacy Act 1993. However, despite its declaration that it is an Act to promote and protect individual privacy, it in fact only covers information privacy. The Privacy Act was created to combat concerns about technological advances and their potential to be used to access private information, when this risk had been far less under manual data systems.Steven Penk and Rosemary Tobin Privacy Law in New Zealand at 50-51. The Act contains 12 Information Privacy Principles which govern the handling of private information by agencies. An 'agency' is widely defined as any person or body of persons, whether public or private, and whether corporate or unincorporated, with specified exceptions.Privacy Act 1993, s 2 and 6. There are also numerous exceptions to the Information Privacy Principles, which can be found both within the principles and in other places within the Act.See Privacy Act 1993, s 6, principles 2 and 3, and ss 54-57 as examples. When an individual feels there has been a breach of the principles he or she can lodge a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner.Privacy Act 1993, ss 66-67. The Privacy Commissioner investigates the complaint and undertakes a process of conciliation rather than punishment.Privacy Act 1993, s 69(1)(b) If the complaint cannot be settled, it may be referred to the Human Rights Review Tribunal, which may or may not consider the situation anew, and it's quite likely that they won't consider a complaint at all (especially if the issue is related to debt). If the Tribunal finds there has been a breach, it may award a range of remedies including damages and restraining orders.Privacy Act 1993, s 85. With one exception, none of the Information Privacy Principles are enforceable in court.Privacy Act 1993, s 11. The Privacy Act recognises that privacy is not an absolute concept and that there are other factors which need to be weighed to determine what the outcome should be. The Privacy Commissioner must always have regard to factors such as human rights, social interests, and international obligations and guidelines.Privacy Act 1993; s 14. The Privacy Commissioner is able to make authorisations regarding the use of private information which would normally be contrary to the Act if he or she is satisfied that the public interest or benefit outweighs the interference with privacy.Privacy Act 1993, s 54. =Broadcasting Act 1989= The Broadcasting Act 1989 requires broadcasters to maintain standards consistent with the privacy of the individual. The Act establishes the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA), which has the functions of receiving and deciding complaints against broadcasters, issuing opinions relating to ethical conduct and standards in broadcasting, and issuing codes of practice for broadcasters and encouraging compliance with them.Broadcasting Act 1989, ss 4(1)(c) and 20-21. Privacy is consistently mentioned in the codes and standards of practice issues by the BSA.Steven Penk and Rosemary Tobin Privacy Law in New Zealand at 206. While the Broadcasting Act does not provide any explanation of what constitutes a breach of privacy, the BSA has seven principles relating to alleged breaches of privacy.Hosking v Runting [2005] 1 NZLR 1 at [104]-[105]. In considering a complaint, the BSA can award a variety of remedies if it finds there has been a breach, but there is no ability to take a complaint to a court of law based on the standards contained within the Act.Broadcasting Act 1989, s 13. Common law A general tort of invasion of privacy exists in New Zealand. The case which is accepted to be the first which found that a tort of privacy may exist was Tucker v News Media Ownership Ltd, in which the judge supported the introduction of such a tort into the law of New Zealand.Tucker v News Media Ownership [1986 NZHC 216]; [1986] 2 NZLR 716 at 731-733 A few years later in Bradley v Wingnut Films, the judge accepted that a tort of privacy did exist in New Zealand law, but that it should be approached with caution as it was in the earlier stages of development.Bradley v Wingnut Films [1993] 1 NZLR 415 at 423. The most crucial New Zealand High Court decision was that of P v D, where the court defined the elements of a tort of privacy as:P v D [2000] 2 NZLR 591 at [34] * The public disclosure of facts * The facts disclosed are of a private nature * The facts made public would be considered highly offensive to a reasonable person * There is insufficient legitimate public concern in having the facts made public. The New Zealand Court of Appeal in a bare majority in Hosking v Runting accepted that there was a tort of privacy in New Zealand. The tort was affirmed as protection in this area was needed and the breach of confidence tort was not suitable to cover situations involving privacy.Hosking v Runting [2005] 1 NZLR 1 at [45]-[49] and [108]-[116]. The two requirements for the tort set out by the majority closely reflect those set out in P v D: * Existence of facts which were reasonably expected to be private * Publicity given to those facts which would be considered highly offensive by the objective and reasonable person. In addition, privacy had to be weighed against the defence of legitimate public concern which encompasses the right to freedom of expression.Hosking v Runting [2005] 1 NZLR 1 at [117], and [129]-[130]. The Supreme Court of New Zealand has in one case accepted that a tort of privacy exists for the purposes of a case before it, but had differing opinions about its requirements and application.Rogers v Television New Zealand [2007] 1 NZSC 91; [2008] 2 NZLR 277 at [23]-[26], [98]-[99], and [144]-[145]. In Brooker v Police the court acknowledged the decision of Hosking but refrained from commenting.Brooker v Police [2007] NZSC 30; [2007] 2 NZLR 91 at [40] and [122]  Security and intelligence  =New Zealand‚Äôs intelligence and security agencies= Two government bodies are responsible for monitoring New Zealand's national security: the Government Communications Security Bureau (the 'GCSB') and the Security Intelligence Service (the 'SIS'). Prior to the introduction of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017, these bodies operated strictly independently of one another, and general mystery surrounded their exact functions and capabilities. Much of the confusion originated from the fact that the SIS and GCSB appeared to have differing objectives which meant that, if required, co-operation and coordination would likely be complex and convoluted. For example, only the SIS could perform surveillance, or spy, on New Zealanders, as provided by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969. There were stipulations as to what 'spy-activities' were permitted, and as a pre-requisite, any proposed surveillance had to be relevant to \\"security\\" and its associated threats, such as instances of 'espionage, sabotage, subversion or terrorist attacks'. =The 2013 surveillance landscape= Kim Dotcom in 2014. The Court of Appeal ruled that the GCSB's surveillance of Dotcom was unlawful. In September 2012 Paul Neazor, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security advised John Key, the then New Zealand Prime Minister, of a situation which would later be called an \\"unlawful interception\\" of an individual known as Kim Dotcom by the GCSB. Following a formal request from the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation that Kim Dotcom be extradited to the United States, the GCSB spied on Mr Dotcom in order to assist the FBI's request. However, as the GCSB did not have the legal authority to conduct surveillance, Justice Gilbert of the Court of Appeal, deemed unlawful.The New Zealand Herald \\"Judge: Dotcom spied on two months longer than previously admitted\\" (21 July 2017) http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=11893618e Following this widely publicised incident, GCSB Director Ian Fletcher and Chief Executive of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Andrew Kibblewhite initiated a review of compliance. They assigned the then Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Kitteridge with undertaking the review to look into the \\"activities, systems and processes since 1 April 2003\\". This date is significant as it was the date from which the Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003 came into force. Rebecca Kitteridge in 2015. She conducted a review of the GCSB's compliance with the law. She is also current Director of the NZ SIS. The ‚ÄúKitteridge Report‚Äù ultimately concluded that GCSB lacked the legal basis and authority to perform many of its intelligence acts ‚Äì including the surveillance carried out on Kim Dotcom. The Kitteridge Report made a number of recommendations to ensure that the Government agency had the legal authority to do the activities necessary. All of the recommendations presented in the Kitteridge Report were accepted by the Government and GCSB which led to a number of legislative reforms. These included giving the GCSB the express capability to legally perform surveillance on New Zealanders when required by the SIS, the police or Defence forces.Andrea Vance ‚ÄúDemystifying the GCSB bill: Spies and lies‚Äù (20 August 2013) At the time when these changes were introduced, with mounting public concern about New Zealanders' rights to privacy, the then Prime Minister John Key stated that the \\"new legislation does not add up to an expansion of the bureau‚Äôs powers\\". It is now permissible for GCSB to legally spy on New Zealanders as a result of the 2013 reforms. In addition, the GCSB's role has expanded and it is now able to perform surveillance on \\"behalf of the SIS, the police or the Defence forces, or for the purposes of cyber security\\". =The 2016 surveillance landscape= In August 2016 the then Prime Minister John Key announced that due to the threat of ISIS and global terrorism, the New Zealand Government would be introducing new legislation to provide further safeguards for New Zealanders. New Zealand's first Intelligence and Security Review was undertaken by Sir Michael Cullen and Dame Patsy Reddy, and looked at \\"the legislative framework governing the agencies and considered whether they were well placed to protect New Zealand‚Äôs current and future national security while protecting individual rights\\". The review was completed at the end of February 2016, and its findings proposed that one Act be introduced to bring all of New Zealand's intelligence and security agencies together. Cullen and Reddy identified a number of issues in their report. One of the prominent issues identified was that the fragmented legislative landscape meant that it was difficult to bring the multiple agencies together when required. Because each intelligence and security agency operated under its own legislative framework, it was confusing for New Zealanders to understand which agency was responsible for what, and exactly what their lawful powers and capabilities were. The reviewers concluded that a \\"single Act\\" was necessary to overcome these issues. They commented that a single Act would: > \\"give a comprehensive and much clearer view of the agencies' functions and > powers, and the checks and balances that apply to the operation of their > powers ‚Ä¶ [and] would avoid inconsistencies and gaps between various statutes > and enable a consistent set of fundamental principles to be applied to the > agencies and their oversight\\". Understandably, drawing the two bodies together would make it easier for them to co-operate and work together when required. Another issue concerning to the reviewers was the lack of security protection available to New Zealanders under the prevailing legislation. The most recent piece of legislation dealing with intelligence and surveillance was enacted some 47 years ago, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969. Over the course of those years and the accompanying advances in technology, the need to overhaul the law has increased markedly. As terrorist groups continue to advance in their technological capabilities, the current legislation was quickly becoming out- dated and unsuitable for present day society. =The Intelligence and Security Act 2017= The purpose of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 was to bring clarity and cohesion to the GCSB and SIS, the two agencies in New Zealand responsible for monitoring the country's security and intelligence. The Act was \\"a direct response to the report of the First Independent Review of Intelligence and Security in New Zealand: Intelligence and Security in a Free Society, and it replaces the four Acts that applied to the GCSB, the NZSIS, and their oversight bodies\\". Given the importance of this proposed legislation, when public submissions for the Bill were called for, 92 were received by the Select Committee. These included submissions made by the New Zealand Law Society, the New Zealand Human Rights Commissioner, and the Privacy Commissioner and many of their recommendations were similar in nature expressing concern over the words used to draft the Bill making the powers of the bodies uncertain, and also the potential for ordinary New Zealanders' privacy rights to be breached. Although the Act intended to give oversight and transparency to the New Zealand intelligence and security agencies, the Act was drafted in a manner that gave far-reaching powers to the GCSB and SIS to perform surveillance on New Zealand citizens and non-residents in ways that had previously been prohibited. The basis for doing so was that New Zealand's national security is at stake with the ever-present and increased risk of terrorism in today's society. The new Act has extended the GCSB's capabilities to perform surveillance on New Zealanders, whereas previously, only the SIS was permitted do this. This extension of the GCSB's powers has the potential to have serious ramifications for all New Zealanders, as author and associate professor of law Stephen Penk notes, \\"surveillance of an individual may lead to a loss of privacy through an individual‚Äôs loss of control or autonomy when, typically, he or she is subjected to undesired monitoring of his or her functions, movements or communications\\"S Penk & R Tobin Privacy Law in New Zealand (2nd ed, Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2016) at 439 As per the recommendations made by Cullen and Reddy the new Act covers a number of points such as: * Bringing the GCSB and SIS together under a single Act for the purpose of achieving co-operation between the agencies. * Clarifying the rules regarding monitoring, gathering, and storing of human intelligence. * Making the SIS and the GCSB state-sector government departments, and therefore requiring them to comply with all regulations governing state-section government bodies. The Act's purpose was expressed in Section 3; which is to \\"protect New Zealand as a free, open, and democratic society\\". This is achieved by: Part 2 of the Act \\"continues the SIS and the GCSB\\" but clarifies that they will remain two separate agencies with differences in capabilities and methods. Although Part 2 makes note of these differences, they will continue to have shared objectives and functions under a \\"joint warranting\\" framework. In response to concerns that this proposed legislation interferes with New Zealanders' human rights, Part 2 provides a number of safeguards. One such safeguard is expressed in sections 12 and 13 that \\"require that the agencies operate in accordance with New Zealand law and all human rights obligations, including when co-operating or sharing intelligence with foreign partners\\". These sections were a direct recommendation of the Human Rights Commission to ensure that New Zealand complies with its international and domestic human rights obligations. Section 22 of the Act provided a further safeguard extending protection to \\"the right to engage in lawful advocacy, protest and dissent\\". This is an important and long-standing human right that ought to be protected. The right to freedom of expression is enshrined in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, with section 14 stating that \\"everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form\\". The right has also been expressed in many other human rights instruments, such as Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which also upholds this right. It is also reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \\"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers\\".Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Art 19 Future directions In dissenting judgments in the 2007 case Brooker v Police, two judges of the Supreme Court of New Zealand voiced their support for the strengthening of privacy rights in New Zealand. McGrath J outlined the international and domestic recognition of the right to privacy, concluded that privacy is close to matching the strength given to the right to freedom of expression, and used the privacy interests of an individual concerned in the case as the main reason for his conclusion and dissent. Thomas J explicitly stated his support for privacy to be given the status of a right, and reasoned his support by citing the NZBORA, international instruments, judicial decisions and social attitudes.Brooker v Police [2007] NZSC 30; [2007] 2 NZLR 91 at [122]-[129] and [136]-[148] per McGrath J dissenting and [164] and [213]-[229] per Thomas J dissenting In August 2011, the New Zealand Law Commission released the fourth and final part to a detailed inquiry into the state of New Zealand's privacy laws. The four parts discuss the concept of privacy, public registers, the invasion of privacy in both civil and criminal contexts, and the Privacy Act 1993.Law Commission A Conceptual Approach to Privacy (MP19, 2007); Law Commission Public Registers: Review of the Law of Privacy Stage 2 (R101, 2008); Law Commission Invasion of Privacy: Penalties and Remedies: Review of the Law of Privacy Stage 3 (R113, 2010); Law Commission Review of the Privacy Act 1993: Review of the Law of Privacy Stage 4 Part 1 (NZLC R123, 2011); Law Commission Review of the Privacy Act 1993: Review of the Law of Privacy Stage 4 Part 2 (NZLC R123, 2011) The Commission recommends a range of changes be made to the law, such as the creation of a Do Not Call register and better protection of online information. Some of these recommendations are currently tabled before Parliament, while others are currently awaiting a response from the government.Law Commission ‚ÄúReview of Privacy‚Äù (2011) In March 2018, Minister of Justice Andrew Little introduced the Privacy Bill to amend the Privacy Act 1993. The Bill will repeal and replace the current Act and make various changes, including strengthening powers for the Privacy Commissioner, introducing mandatory reporting of privacy breaches, creating new offences and increasing fines.

The school was founded in 2000, and is governed by a board of trustees. The Academy is accredited through ISACS (Independent Schools Association of the Central States). History In February 2000, a core group of parents, community members, and administrators founded Peoria Academy as an independent, private, non-profit school, serving students in Kindergarten through 8th grade. A 3 million dollar capital campaign was established to purchase the Knights of Columbus building on Willow Knolls Drive and renovations began immediately. Peoria Academy opened its doors in August 2000 with 137 students. In 2001, a Pre-K program was added, and additional classes were added at each grade level. Due to the growth of the school and insufficient space, the Board of Trustees began leasing the Notre Dame Youth Center, which is adjacent to the Peoria Academy property. In 2010, founding Headmaster Karen Calder retired after ten years of service. In 2010, the school also began building additional classrooms to accommodate the growing student population. The results were two brand new, steel-reinforced classrooms that also serve as state-rated tornado shelters. In 2011, a Pre-K3 program was added. Technology The school has implemented a one-to-one computer program in the Middle School. Smartboards or projectors are used in nearly every classroom throughout the school. During the 2013-2014 school year, a STEM course was added to the Middle School core curriculum. Fine Arts Every student PreK3- 8th grade participates in Art. The Art program is extensive and includes drawing, making prints, ceramics, painting and more. The PreK3- PreK program is focused on developing and refining fine motor skills by working with many different mediums. Each week a different artist is studied by reading books and looking at pictures of their work which then is used in the weekly lesson recreating their own art pieces inspired by the weekly author. Students, grades 2-8, present a theatrical production every year, ranging from popular Broadway musicals to dramas. The students are involved in every aspect of the productions, both on stage and behind the scenes. In addition to regular course offerings in art and music, Peoria Academy offers additional classes through their After-school Enrichment Program (AEP), which is open to Peoria Academy students and the public. Courses include various instrument lessons ranging from piano all the way to ukulele, a variety of dance styles, specialized art classes, creative writing, games and more. Foreign Language Peoria Academy begins foreign language instruction at the Pre-K3 level, with instruction twice a week in Spanish, and it continues in all grade levels through the 4th grade. In the 5th-8th grade, Spanish language instruction is provided as one of the six core classes. Every year, students in 8th grade may opt to take a summer trip to a Spanish- speaking country. Athletics Physical education and athletic programs are a part of the school's philosophy for developing the whole child. In competitive sports and cheerleading, Peoria Academy has a no-cut policy to encourage maximum participation by all interested students. Peoria Academy's athletics provide opportunities for students to participate in various sports at developmentally appropriate levels. Students are expected to demonstrate cooperative play, commitment to their team and adherence to rules and guidelines as established by each coach. The goal is to develop young people athletically, academically, and to better prepare them for the challenges that lie ahead. Peoria Academy teams compete locally with both public and parochial schools. They also participate in IESA in basketball, volleyball, and cross country. Peoria Academy sports include: Girls' Basketball, Boys' Basketball, Cheerleading, Volleyball, Track and Cross Country.

According to the US Geological Survey, the mountain's proper name is Howard Knob, but it is known to locals and tourists as Howard's Knob. Howard Knob and the surrounding area are part of the Appalachian Mountain Range. The mountain has an elevation of above sea level, and rises nearly above the town of Boone and the campus of Appalachian State University. History Howard Knob was named after Benjamin Howard, a British loyalist, contemporary of Daniel Boone, and early settler of the area. According to local legend, Howard hid from Whigs on the knoll which was to be named after him. In 1977, the Federal Energy Research and Development Administration and the Department of Energy announced that Howard Knob had been selected as the site for an experimental wind turbine, which was later built by General Electric in October 1978. The project was part of a surge in renewable energy research which began under then-President Jimmy Carter. The turbine, formally known as MOD-1, was managed by NASA and operated by Blue Ridge Electric Membership Corporation. It stood tall and had two long steel blades that rotated counterclockwise at . It was designed to power 300 to 500 average-sized homes, given wind speeds of . An unintended consequence of the new technology was a low-frequency \\"swish-swish\\" or \\"wooshing\\" noise that irritated locals. In March and April 1980, DOE and NASA engineers determined that a two-cycle-per-second sound was generated by wind blowing through the blades. Although the sound was twenty cycles below the range of human hearing, it caused windows and other objects to vibrate audibly.\\"O'Toole, T. \\"Windmill Experiment Ordered Limited; An Annoying Noise Irks Neighbors,\\" Washington Post, 4/23/1980. A group of Appalachian State University students calling themselves \\"Wooshies\\" mocked the turbine project in a class video and gained the attention of local and regional newspapers. The turbine was also blamed for disrupting television signals. Some questioned whether it was working at all, since the blades did not seem to move very often. The turbine was dismantled in 1983. The abandoned turbine site on Howard Knob was handed over to the county to serve as a park \\"in perpetuity.\\" Howard Knob has been at times a popular spot for bouldering, rock climbing, and hang gliding. However, those activities were discouraged and ultimately prohibited by town authorities and private property owners. Land Conservancy With unparalleled views of downtown Boone and the surrounding mountains, Howard Knob has often been targeted for residential development. In December 2004, owners of a tract on Howard Knob allied with the High Country Conservancy and signed a conservation easement protecting as a forested natural area with limited provisions for hiking trails and a small shelter. Three of the owners' remaining acres were slated for residential plots near existing homes.

History Punkte originated as a punctual orchestral work which was begun in September in Hamburg and had reached a first-draft stage by 30 September. The final draft was completed on 24 October 1952, but the work remained unperformed and unpublished (; ). The work did not receive the title by which it is known today until much later, however. In a letter dated 4 November 1952 to (the editor from Universal Edition in Vienna who, at the premiere of Stockhausen's Spiel at the Donaueschingen Festival in October, had offered to publish his works), Stockhausen initially called his new score Zweites Orchesterspiel / Kontrapunkte / f√ºr Saiten- und Blasinstrumente, and in a letter to his friend Karel Goeyvaerts dated 14 January 1953, he calls the orchestral work Nr. 4 Kontrapunkte, adding, \\"It will be very difficult to perform this work\\". At this point in time, the chamber composition now known as Kontra-Punkte (with a hyphen) was instead called simply Nr 5‚Ä¶, f√ºr 10 Instrumente. After a heated discussion in March with Hermann Scherchen, who Stockhausen hoped would conduct the work at a festival in Cologne, he decided to withdraw the score, and substituted the chamber work for ten instruments, now redesignated \\"Nr 1\\", and eventually given the title Kontra-Punkte. The withdrawn orchestral score, which has never been performed, was renamed Punkte at some unknown point in time . Stockhausen wholly recomposed this score in 1962, at which time it was given the retrospective work number ¬Ω (the fraction indicating that it preceded his \\"work number 1\\"). Work was begun during a four-week stay in Finland in the summer, when Stockhausen was lecturing at the Jyv√§skyl√§ summer university. It was intended for performance in Palermo later in the year, but the score was not finished in time and the event was cancelled. Having rescheduled the premiere for Donaueschingen the following year, Stockhausen resumed work in October 1962 while staying at the house of his Darmstadt pupil Jack Brimberg in Locust Valley on Long Island, New York. After some anxious correspondence with Heinrich Strobel, director of the Donaueschingen Festival, the score was completed and dispatched to Strobel on 28 February 1963 . In its new form, the \\"points\\" of the original version scarcely ever appear as such. Instead, they have become centres for groups, crowds, swarms, and vibrating masses, become nuclei of micro-musical organisms . This \\"renewed\\" composition was premiered on 20 October 1963 at the Donaueschingen Music Festival, by the Orchestra of the SWF, conducted by Pierre Boulez, and was published by Universal Edition that year in facsimile . Not yet satisfied with the result, Stockhausen made major changes to the new Punkte in 1964, and again in 1966 . These versions were also published, and Stockhausen made further revisions in 1969, at which time Universal Edition began work on an engraved edition. Production stopped in 1973 only to restart in 1974 and, after Stockhausen made still more revisions in 1975, work resumed the next year. The engraved score was only finally finished (with further minor corrections made up to 1993) in 1996 . Instrumentation =1952 version= The original version was for a small orchestra of either 27 or 30 players : * 1 flute * 2 oboes * 1 E clarinet * 1 B clarinet * 1 bass clarinet in B * 1 soprano (changing to alto) saxophone * 1 baritone saxophone * 1 bass saxophone or bass sarrusophone * 2 bassoons * 1 horn in B * 1 cornet in B * 1 trumpet in C * 1 trombone * 1 [or 3] percussionists, playing 12 chromatically tuned bongos * 1 piano (with softer tone, such as a Bl√ºthner) * 1 piano (with harder tone, such as a Bechstein) * 2 harps (one with thin strips of paper woven through the strings) * 2 violins [or 2 each first and second violins] * 2 violas * 2 [or just 1] cellos * 1 contrabass =1962‚Äì93 version= * 3 flutes (all + piccolo, 3rd + alto flute in G) * 3 oboes (ob. 1 + oboe d'amore; oboe 3 + cor anglais) * 3 clarinets (E clarinet, B clarinet, and bass clarinet in B) * 3 bassoons (third + contrabassoon) * 3 horns in F * 3 trumpets in C * 1 tenor trombone * 1 bass trombone * 1 bass tuba * 3 percussionists: ** tubular chimes, keyboard glockenspiel, 2 pedal timpani **vibraphone **marimbaphone * 2 harps * 2 pianos (second + celesta) * 8 first violins * 8 second violins * 8 violas * 6 cellos * 4 contrabasses Analysis Punkte is divided into 144 overarching sections, characterised by sets of shapes and textures. Each isolated tone of the 1952 version was used as a \\"nucleus\\", and these nuclei were composed out into a variety of complex figures. There are six basic triangular shapes, with the nucleus at one apex : #The nucleus tone is sustained while other pitches expand above it into a band: 30px #The nucleus tone is sustained while other pitches expand below it into a band: 30px #A band of sound begins, and the upper notes descend until only the nucleus is left at the bottom: 30px #A band of sound begins, and the lower notes ascend until only the nucleus is left at the top: 30px #The first two shapes are combined, so that pitches fan out in both directions to form a band both above and below the nucleus # The third and fourth shapes are combined, so that a band of pitches narrows toward the nucleus at the centre The vertical width of each pitch band is controlled by a serial distribution of chromatic intervals, from a single tone, via the minor second, major second, minor third, and so on up to a major seventh . Each of these six shapes may be composed in any of six textures : #All notes continuous #Notes are rhythmicised #The sound texture is perforated by rests, sounding like Morse code #All notes in the texture make glissandos #All notes have tremolos or trills #The note attacks are \\"verticalised\\" into a succession of chords Some of these textures can be combined. For example, the opening section of Punkte combines normal tones and trills . Similarly, there are places where the triangular sound shapes overlap so densely (due to the density of the points in the structure of the original 1952 version) that the entire space is filled with sound, leaving no silences. This situation suggested the idea of negative forms. The usual conception is that sounds are heard as being projected against a background of silence. In these negative structures, the situation is reversed. Sustained clusters are made to sound for a comparatively long time, from which some of the sounds are erased. The \\"holes\\" therefore are the music . Both durations and pitches are distributed through the use of permutations, which serve as an aid to repetition, without repeating exactly the same thing. Diversity in unity is the principle of permutation, in dividing the larger elements into their smaller components . Discography ;1962 version * Donaueschinger Musiktage 1950‚Äì1990.

Retrieved 11 Sept 2011. Alternate names for this lake include Lost Loon Lake. Lost Coon Lake was originally known as \\"Nigger Lake\\". It was named in the late 1800s or early 1900s. The name allegedly came about from the fact that an African American woman named Mrs. Randals ran a rooming house for lumberjacks near the lake. Although a historic attempt at racism, the name was not accurate as many later claimed that Mrs. Randals was of Spanish descent. The name began to cause controversy in the mid 20th century when Washington bureaus began to refuse ice harvest contracts with the name on them. They began to reference the lake as \\"Lodgepole Lake\\", while locals continued to call it \\"Nigger Lake\\". By the 1980s when upscale developments were being targeted for the area, perhaps as a compromise of sorts, the lake was renamed \\"Lost Coon Lake\\".

With a career spanning from 1912 to 1966, he is said to have designed 150 public and private projects across Romania, his work reflecting the evolution of local architecture in the first half of the 20th century from French Renaissance, though Neo-Romanian to modernism. Though also designing private villas and apartments, he designed some of the major interwar public buildings in the country, including the Timisoara Theatre, the Elisabeth Palace in Bucharest for the royal family, and the Victory Palace, which now houses the office of the Prime Minister. Biography Born in 1885 in a small town on the Danube (now on the border with Serbia), Marcu came from a modest family. In 1900 he enrolled in the new Carol I High School in Craiova, where he is awarded special prizes in drawing. In 1905, he decided to attend the School of Architecture in Bucharest, but after only a year he left for Paris, where he studied at the famous √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, graduating in 1912. Almost immediately he gains prestigious commissions, and by the mid 1930s is practically the government‚Äôs preferred architect. In his biography which he published in 1960, he divides his career into three phases, which overlap : \\"works of classical conception\\", that is academic and eclectic architecture, which stretches from 1912 to 1925; ‚Äútraditional architectural works‚Äù, that is Neo-Romanian architecture between 1920 and 1930; and ‚Äúworks of modern Romanian architecture‚Äù, between 1925 and 1960, the year of publication of the work (though he ceased designing in 1945). After WW2, he continued his teaching and pedagogical activities, having already been Professor of \\"city aesthetics\\" at the Higher School of State Sciences in Bucharest (1923-1927) and substitute teacher at the Higher School of Architecture in Bucharest (now the Ion Mincu Architecture University) from 1927, which in 1929 became a professorship, which he held until 1957. He also became president of the Romanian Architects‚Äô Union (1953-1966), and from 1955 a member of the Romanian Academy. Hi died 9 March 1966 in Bucharest. Architecture Engineer Bu≈üilƒÉ House, 1933 In 1912-1913, his first job on returning from Paris was to work with architect Nicolae Ghica-Bude»ôti on the Physics and Mathematics Department addition to the University of Bucharest, in the heart of the city; the design carried on the French Academic classicism of the existing University buildings, with flattened pilasters and prominent dormer windows. His next notable project was the grand Vasilescu Villa, also French Beaux-Arts style, typical for the period before WW1. By the early 1920s he was practicing in the newly fashionable Neo-Romanian style, beginning with the large commission for the Timi»ôoara Polytechnic, and then applied to another large project, the Timisoara Opera, in 1923-27. Instead of only applying the details of other architects, he made his own study trips, his research focuses especially on the Brancoveanu style, peasant houses in his native region, Oltenia, as well as on the monasteries in Moldova, which explains the presence of Byzantine as well as regional influences in his Neo-Romanian works. By the early 30s, along with most Romanian architects, his work was heavily influenced by the modern movement, but often combined with traditional or classical influences. He produced a number of simple cubic villas with a single arched doorway or rustic details, but also some simple streamlined apartment houses. A well known commercial project from this time was the modernisation of the Athenee Palace Hotel in the mid 30s, taking it from pre-war eclectic to a more refined image. The Royal Railway Stations at both Sinaia and Banasea are elegant, stylised classical pavilions, while the House of State Monopolies in Bucharest is his most daringly modern design.Government of Romania: History of Victoria Palace , retrieved 11 September 2011 He is best known for designing some of the largest government building projects in Bucharest in the 1930s, employing stylised classical forms influenced by Italian rationalist architecture of the period. They include the CFR (State Railways) Palace, the Military Academy, and finally the huge Victory Palace.

Breeds which have less under fluff and feathers which are closer to the body fall under hard feather, such as the Old English Game and Asil. Breeds with more under fluff and softer feathers, such as the Silkie, Australorp and Leghorn, are classed as soft feather. The Australian Poultry Standards also includes standards for ducks, geese, turkeys and Guinea fowl. Ducks are divided into two classes, bantam or standard size, and all turkeys, geese and guinea fowl have only one class each.

The ad's tagline is \\"Feel the Power.\\" Beyonc√© Pulse comes in an upside-down chrome-and-blue bottle, neatly tucked into a holographic carton, inspired by Knowles' fashion during stage performances. It features notes of pear blossom, peony, midnight blooming jasmine, Madagascar vanilla, and bluebird orchid. The commercial for the fragrance was directed by Jake Nava, and features the instrumental of Knowles' lead single \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" from her album 4. Photographer Lionel Gasperini photographed the scents printing advertisements. Conception =Development= Beyonc√© Pulse follows Knowles' scents Heat (2010) and Heat Rush (2011). Knowles first revealed Beyonc√© Pulse in an exclusive interview with Elle magazine on June 25, 2011. She started by giving a hint at the motive behind Beyonc√© Pulse, stating: \\"Women always tell me that my music makes them feel strong and confident and Beyonc√© Pulse is about finding that inner power.\\" It features notes of pear blossom, peony, midnight blooming jasmine, Madagascar vanilla, and bluebird orchid. According to Knowles' official parfum website, Beyonc√© Pulse possesses \\"an energy unlike any other. It moves through you, around you. Never fading as it surges, pulsates and electrifies. The woman who wears Beyonc√© Pulse is impossible to ignore, exuding sensuality and strength. Knowles put time into developing the scent, getting feedback from friends and family including her husband Jay-Z. She told Access Hollywood: \\"I wear it, I live with it for about six months, and we tweak. I make sure I get my compliments from everyone‚Äîfrom my fans to my husband.\\" According to Knowles, the scent is made to help women feel empowered, and a fragrance is an important accessory: \\"When you feel good, when you look good, when you smell good, when you're fresh, it makes you feel so confident. You feel that much more sexy when you know that you're going to leave a lasting impression.\\" Beyonc√© Pulse was inspired by her alter ego, Sasha Fierce which she used during the I Am... Sasha Fierce era. Knowles also told People magazine that Beyonc√© Pulse is a fragrance that women can wear all the time. She added loves the idea of \\"a signature scent\\" that lets a woman \\"leave her mark wherever she goes\\", and that is the reason for which she always tries to make her scents appropriate for any occasion. During her interview with Elle magazine, Knowles compared Beyonc√© Pulse to her previous scents and stated how she discovered similarities between music and perfume: > Women always tell me that my music makes them feel strong and confident, and > Pulse is about finding that inner power. Pulse represents the woman I am on > stage. When I think about excitement, it makes me think about my heart > racing and a pulsating beat‚Äîit's my stage persona. Heat represents my > sensual side, it's very spicy and Southern. Heat Rush is more about the > woman I am on my off time, when I'm on vacation. [...] I'm learning that > they're very similar! Figuring out the ingredients in a fragrance that > complement each other is no different than trying to figure out the > combination of melody and lyrics for a song‚Äîit's just as difficult. Both are > something that take a lot of hard work. You need to have a strong opinion > and know exactly what you want. I use my instincts from writing songs and > coming up with videos‚Äîall of the things that have developed my taste > level‚Äîand apply them toward making a fragrance. =Packaging and scent= The fragrance comes in an upside-down chrome-and- blue bottle, neatly tucked into a holographic carton. The bottle is topped by a chrome cap, which was inspired by Knowles' stage costumes, as she states \\"I love [that] because it incorporates fashion into the overall design.\\" The scents' packaging states \\"Resembling a luminous crystal, the tactile bottle seems otherworldly, as if encasing an as-yet-discovered, carefully guarded energy source of precious reserves. The Beyonc√© Pulse holographic carton shimmers and shines in shades of blue and silver, radiating light and power, as if bursting from the edge of the universe.\\" Reflective of Knowles' incredible energy and powerful femininity, the fresh notes in Beyonc√© Pulse intermingle to create a unique citrus, floral gourmand, anchored by Knowles' favorite flower, the orchid. The fragrances top notes sparkle of fresh pear blossom, effervescent blue Cura√ßao accord and frosted bergamot. The scents heart notes feature sophisticated floral heat of enticing bluebird orchid, delicate peony and fragrant midnight blooming jasmine. The scent finishes in its base notes with dry-down of warm, opulent Madagascar vanilla, seductive musk and sensual precious woods.

Reception Rap-Up described the scent as \\"electric\\". Nakisha Williams of Black Entertainment Television complimented the fragrance, stating \\"even though the fragrance is being billed as 'powerful' and 'electrifying,' it comes off as a crisp citrusy-floral scent that doesn't overpower.\\" At the 2011 International Hologram Manufacturers Association's (IHMA) Awards, Beyonc√© Pulse won in the category for \\"Best Applied Decorative Product\\". The perfume was nominated in the categories for \\"Fragrance of the Year\\", \\"Best Packaging of the Year\\" and \\"Consumer Choice Award\\" at the 2012 FiFi Awards which were presented on May 21, 2012.Sources confirming the nominations of the perfume at the 2012 Fifi Awards.

It was released in March 2012, two months after Knowles gave birth to her daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, in January of the same year. The summary for the fragrance is, \\"Life is a flirt. Love is a game. The sky is your limit. Beyonc√© Pulse Summer Edition gives you a burst of the inexplicable energy you feel during the Summer. It will leave you feeling great, ready to conquer anything, as if nothing and no one could ever resist you.\\" Its composition is floral ‚Äì fruity with fresh sparkling top notes and creamy base. The top notes include icy mandarin, pear and pink pepper. The heart is exotic and floral, featuring ginger orchid, jasmine and orange blossom. The creamy base is composed of sapphire woods, musk and benzoin. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum. It comes in a turquoise and pink bottle which features an inverted chrome cap that was inspired by Knowles' stage costumes. According to a press release, it was designed to \\"capture the essence of a playful, sun-drenched summer day\\" and was inspired by Knowles' \\"infectious and positive energy\\". Nathalie Atkinson of The National Post held a sniff test for Knowles' Pulse Summer Edition to assess the different scents picked up by people of the opposite sex. Cosmetics editor Dave Lackie, who was asked to be the male participant of the scent, graded it with one-and-a-half stars out of four and commented, \\"When I spray this scent all I smell is lemon. Lots and lots of lemon. Turns out it is a note called icy mandarin. Five minutes later, I still smell the lemon, but that's joined with orange flower. There's an underlying sweetness to this that is a little off-putting. The dry-down is Beyonce's trademark creamy musk. If you like Beyonce, still with her first scent. It's the best of the lot.\\" Atkinson, the female participant, graded it with one star out of four and said, \\"When life hands you lemons, make Kool-Aid. Or this spritz. It's a pitcher of ade made by enterprising youngsters on a hot summer's day: made from drink crystals and served from a stand at the foot of the driveway. Accordingly, there's a lot of sugar stirred in that hasn't quite dissolved, and probably won't. Which is why you buy a 25-cent glass to be kind, but only pretend to take a sip.\\" Marianne Mychaskiw of InStyle magazine described the perfume as a \\"flirty take on the original version\\". HollywoodLife's Jennifer Tzeses praised the perfume, describing it as a \\"light, playful scent\\". She also added that \\"[the] scent captures the feel of a happy, sun-filled summer day... 'Beyonc√© Pulse Summer Edition' echoes the same sensual feel of its predecessor... but is a lighter and fresher version.\\" A writer of People also agreed that the perfume was similar with its predecessor, but had a \\"little lighter\\" scent. Pulse NYC Pulse NYC is the third follow-up from Beyonc√© Pulse. The Fragrance was released in 2013, the name is an honour to world capital, New York and is a novelty in line of fragrances by Knowles.

Cast *Aaron Kwok *Eason Chan *Rene Liu *Gwei Lun-mei *Angelababy *Jing Boran *Xu Fan *Chapman To *Grace Huang *Liu Jinshan Plot The film tells the stories of a mother and her three daughters about their own struggles in love. All the women had achieved progress in some way except in love. However, each of them found their own Mr.Right in the end. The woman named Mary (acted by XuFan) was a widow and came back to China from abroad. She was a generous woman and she learnt to cook with the help of a driver called Uncle Hua. After being together for a period of time, they fell in love. The eldest daughter, Rose (acted by Rene Liu), was an astronaut, who was very independent and capable, but also a little bit competitive. In order to have the chance to go into space, she trained hard, only to find that she had to work with her ex: Michael (acted by Aaron Kwok). They stayed in the small capsule, working, eating and sleeping in the same place. Many things happened to them, making the fire of their love burn again. The second daughter, called Lily (acted by Gwei Lun-mei), was in Sydney. Although she suffered from Mysophobia, she found herself attracted to Jonny (acted by Eason Chan), a man who collects garbage. they both loved each other very much and even sacrificed themselves to make one another feel happy. Eventually, they overcame all their difficulties and led a happy life. The third daughter, whose name was Peony (acted by Angelababy) was a famous star but wasn't good at acting; so she went to a Cafe to become a waitress in order to gain experiences. There, she met a poor guy named Wenfeng (acted by Jing Boran).

In humans, the RhAG, RhBG, and RhCG Rhesus proteins constitute solute carrier family 42 whilst RhD and RhCE form the Rh blood group system. The three-dimensional structure of the ammonia transport protein AmtB from Escherichia coli has been determined by x-ray crystallography; ; revealing a hydrophobic ammonia channel. The human RhCG ammonia transporter was found to have a similar ammonia-conducting channel structure. It was proposed that the erythrocyte Rh complex is a heterotrimer of RhAG, RhD, and RhCE subunits in which RhD and RhCE might play roles in anchoring the ammonia-conducting RhAG subunit to the cytoskeleton. Based on reconstitution experiments, purified RhCG subunits alone can function to transport ammonia. RhCG is required for normal acid excretion by the mouse kidney and epididymis.  Structure  The structure of the ammonia channel from E. coli, was, at the time of its publication, the highest resolution structure of any integral membrane protein. It shows a trimer of subunits, each made up of 11 transmembrane segments (TMSs) and containing a pseudo two-fold symmetry. Each monomer contains a hydrophobic ammonia conducting channel. While prokaryotic ammonia channel proteins have an N-terminal region which acts as a signal sequence and is cleaved in the mature protein, the Rhesus glycoproteins retain this as a 12th transmembrane helix in the mature protein.  Substrate specificity  Most functionally characterized members of the family are ammonium uptake transporters. Some, but not other Amt proteins also transport methylammonium. Detailed phylogenetic analyses of plant homologues have been published. In E. coli, NH4+, rather than NH3, may be the substrate of AmtB, but controversy still exists. If NH4+ is transported, K+ possibly serves as a counter ion in an antiport process with K+, and that one histidine removes a proton off of NH4+ to yield NH3. =Transport reaction= The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by members of the Amt family are suggested to be: :NH4+ (out) ‚áå NH4+ (in)  Mechanism  The X-ray structures have revealed that the pore of the Amt and Rh proteins is characterized by a hydrophobic portion about 12 √Ö long, in which electronic density was observed in the crystallographic study of AmtB from Escherichia coli. This electronic density was initially only observed when crystals were grown in the presence of ammonium, and was thus attributed to ammonia molecules. The Amt/Rh protein mechanism might involve the single- file diffusion of NH3 molecules. However, the pore could also be filled with water molecules. The possible presence of water molecules in the pore lumen calls for a reassessment of the notion that Amt/Rh proteins work as plain NH3 channels. Indeed, functional experiments on plant ammonium transporters and Rh proteins suggest a variety of permeation mechanisms including the passive diffusion of NH3, the antiport of NH4+/H+, the transport of NH4+, or the cotransport of NH3/H+. Lamoureux et al. discuss these mechanisms in light of functional and simulation studies on the AmtB transporter.  Regulation  In E. coli the AmtB gene is expressed only under limiting nitrogen levels to yield the AmtB protein. It is co-expressed with the GlnK gene which encodes a PII protein. This protein is also trimeric and remains in the cytoplasm. It is covalently modified by a U/U deuridylylated group at Y51. The hydrolyzed product, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, orients the surface of GlnK for AmtB blockade. When nitrogen levels outside the cell rise, the ammonia channel must be deactivated to prevent excessive ammonia entering the cell (where ammonia would be combined with glutamate to make glutamine, utilizing ATP and thereby depleting the cell's ATP reserves). This deactivation is achieved by deuridylylation of the GlnK protein which then binds to the cytoplasmic face of AmtB and inserts a loop into the ammonia conducting pore. At the tip of this loop is an arginine residue which sterically blocks the channel.;  Human ammonia transporter-related proteins  RHAG, RHBG, RHCE, RHCG RHD  References  Category:Solute carrier family ","title":"Ammonia transporter"},{"id":"33049369","text":"Paddy Hirsch is a fictionThe Devil‚Äôs Half Mile: Journalist Hirsch makes his fiction debut with a superb historical whodunit. https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7653-9913-7 and non-fictionPublishers Weekly, 22 July 2012 \\"Publishers Weekly Non-fiction review, Man vs Markets\\", retrieved 18 October 2012 author, journalist, web video host, financial blogger and a commentator on the economyTodd Mundt, WFPL News, 22 August 2011 \\" \\"Senior Editor Paddy Hirsch on the backstory behind the financial crisis on the Marketplace special The Breakdown\\" , retrieved 10 September 2011The Economist, 3 February 2006 \\"The state of American media\\", retrieved 10 September 2011 and financial marketsThe Economist, 20 April 2006 \\"US leveraged loans\\", retrieved 10 September 2011 He is the author of the Justice Flanagan series of historical thrillers, including The Devil's Half Mile and Hudson's Kill, and of Man vs Markets, Economics Explained, Plain and Simple, a lighthearted, illustrated book explaining the workings of the financial markets, published by HarperCollins.

History Works for the abbey and church were started in the 10th century over a pre-existing oratory associated with St. Colombanus. In 1477 the whole complex was damaged by a fire. The abbey basilica was rebuilt from around 1490, with the present design by Bernardino Zaccagni dating from 1510. The construction ended around 1519. The design included since the beginning a thoroughly painting decoration of the interior, and a contract had been signed with the young Correggio, who a had already worked in another Benedictine monastery, in the Camera della Badessa of San Paolo. Correggio executed five frescoes groups. The first includes the lunette with St. John and the Eagle (c. 1520), followed by the dome, with the Ascension of Christ and the drum and the four pendentives decoration. The third work was the decoration of the vault and the apse ceiling of the Cappella Maggiore, partially destroyed in 1586 when the choir was prolonged: today the central fragment with the Coronation of the Virgin (now at the Galleria nazionale di Parma) has survived. The fourth intervention was in the choir's walls, which were totally destroyed during its reconstruction. Finally, Correggio added a painted frieze which runs for the whole internal perimeter. Preparatory drawings show that also the parts executed by his pupils were designed by Correggio, such as the candelabra in the presbytery's vault and the puttos on the cross-vaults. Around 1524, Correggio also painted two canvasses in the Del Bono Chapel, now at the Galleria nazionale di Parma: the Lamentation for Dead Christ and the Martyrdom of Four Saints. Description The marble fa√ßade of the church was designed by Simone Moschino in proto-Baroque style in 1604, and completed in 1607. The bell tower on the right side, perhaps designed by Giovanni Battista Magnani, was completed in 1613. With a height of 75 meters, it is the tallest in Parma. =Interior= Detail of Correggio's frieze. The interior is on the Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles covered with cross vaults, and a dome at the crossing. The structure is similar to the nearby cathedral's. The grooved piers are Renaissance elements of classical inspiration. In the nave is a frieze by Correggio and his workshop (c. 1522-1524). Is ia long strip with monochrome paintings (with few red details) on a dark blue background, including also some tondoes with portraits of Benedictine popes, cardinals and monks. The main feature is a series of puttos in actions symbolizing the importance of the Christian mess and sacrifice. The grotesque decorations on the semi-piers and the vault decoration (with candelabra, puttos and symbols of St. John the Evangelist) were also from Correggio's pupils, in particular Michelangelo Anselmi (c. 1520). St. Nicholas by Michelangelo Anselmi. The left nave has a baptismal font whose base is a c. 1st century AD Roman funerary monument. The twelve side chapels were frescoes by local artists (including Angelo Michele Colonna) in the late 16th century and early 17th century. The first chapel on the left has an arch frescoed by Parmigianino, with St. Agatha and the Executioner and Sts. Stephen and Lawrence. These are monumental figures influenced by Pordenone's frescoes in the Cathedral of Cremona. Another Sts. Stephen and Lawrence and a Saint Vitalis with the Horse, both by Parmigianino, are in the following chapel. Attributed to Parmigianino, but today considered by Anselmi, is a fresco cycle in the Zancheri Chapel, whose altarpiece is by Girolamo Mazzola Bedoli (Mystical Marriage of St. Catherine of Alexandria, 1536). Anselmi also painted a Christ Carrying the Cross (c. 1522) in the sixth left chapel. Lunette of St. John and the Eagle by Correggio. Works in the right chapels include an Cristoforo Caselli's Adoration of the Magi (1449, third chapel), Mazzola Bedoli's altarpiece of Madonna with Child and St. James (c. 1543-1545, fourth chapel), and 18th century copies of Correggio's canvasses in the Del Bono Chapel, whose arch has maintained frescoes executed by his pupils under his design (Conversion of St. Paul and Saints Andrew and Peter). The ceiling of the left crossing was painted by Anselmi with a St. Benedict Enthroned and Four Saints (1521), while the walls show terracotta sculptures by Antonio Begarelli (St. John the Evangelist and Madonna with Child and St. John, c. 1543). In the arch of the right chapel of the presbytery are additional frescoes by Bedoli. The right apse has ceiling frescoes of Stories of the Life of St. John of Parma by Anselmi. The altarpiece with the Miracle of Sy. John was painted by Emilio Taruffi (1674). At the walls are two groups by Begarelli, portraying St. Felicita with Saint Vitalis and St. Benedict. The presbytery has grotesque decorations attributed to Correggio, while the puttos were added around 1588 by Innocenzo Martini; a fresco from 1587 replicates the original by Correggio, of which only the central part remains, now at the Galleria Nazionale di Parma. The altarpiece is a Transfiguration by Bedoli (c. 1556). The carved wooden choir is from 1513-1538. The portal leading to the sacristy has a fresco by Correggio in the lunette, depicting St. John and the Eagle and generally considered his first work in the church, although similarities with the dome decoration could imply that it dates from a later period. The inscription ALTIUS CAETERIS DEI PATEFECIT ARCAN around the painting refers to the nocturnal prayers of the monks. The sacristy was frescoed in 1508 by Cesare Cesariano. Monastery The monastery has three cloisters. The first has Ionic columns, the second has decorations by Correggio and the third, known as Cloister of St. Benedict, has early 16th-century frescoes. The associated library has manuscript and codexes testifying the amanuensis activity of the local monks. The manuscripts arrived here from the monastery of Santa Giustina in Padua without decorations, and here were decorated by Damiano da Moile, Francino da Moile and, starting from 1492, da Michele da Genova. The monastery has also an ancient grocery, documented since 1201. Its dependences include the Abbey of Santa Maria della Neve at Torrechiara.

Life and contribution  Vaduvur (Vaduvoor) Veeravalli Sri Srinivasa Desikachariar Swami was born in Vaduvur, India on 4 November 1928 (Vibhava Varusham Aippasi Maasam Pushya Nakshatram), to Srimathi Kanakavalli and Sri Veeraraghavachariar. Five generations of his ancestors were trained in Veda Adhyayis and were rendering service to Srimad Andavan Ashramam without compensation His uncle (Chitappa), Ganapadi Sri Narasimhachariar, was one of the great Veda teachers of those days, teaching in the famous Veda Patasala in Mannargudi founded by Sri Anna Swami Iyengar (continued by his son, A. Srinivasa Iyengar Swami). In fact, he introduced the weekly tests in Veda Patasalas in Tamil Nadu modelled after the Kerala pattern. When his father died when he was 12, the young Desikachariar was enrolled by his uncle, in that Patasala and started training in Divya Prabandham from Kanthadai Ramanujachariar Swami and later Veda Adhyayanam from his uncle. He completed Veda Adhyayanam (up to Kramantham) in seven years and completed the Ganantham and then Salakshanam (equivalent to PhD) in just one more year. He was examined at the Sankara Mutt and cleared these in First Class. As Yajamana Bhakti, when Sri Desikachariar was honoured with the President Award in 2001, he went straight to Mannargudi and sought the blessings of A Srinivasa Iyengar Swami, his well wisher and founder of Mannargudi Veda Pata Sala and then later visited his own house in Vaduvur.  Prapathi/Saranagathi  Srimad Andavan Swami and Vaduvur Desikachariar Our Swami had his Prapatthi performed at a very tender age by Srimad Therazhundur Andavan Swami and Samasrayanam under Akkur Andavan Swami. Thus, he along with Sri Thenbirai Lakshmi Raghavachariar remains one of the few living sishyas with links to six Acharya Sreshtas of the Andavan Parampara.  Our Swami and late Sri Kanchi Paramacharya  While Sri Desikachariar was 13 years old and having training in Prabandha Adyayenam, Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati Swami was visiting Mannargudi. The great Sage had tremendous respect for the Mannargudi family. Srinivasa Iyengar introduced the young scholar to Paramacharya, who asked the boy to recite the \\"Koondhal malar mangaikkum man madanthaikkum\\". Young Sri Desikachariar recited this Pasuram in a resounding manner and was blessed by the Paramacharya. Later, Sri Desikachariar's Ganantham Pariksha was conducted by none other than Late Kanchi Paramacharya himself. Tremendously impressed by the then young Yajur Veda Ganapadi, Paramacharya appointed him as a Parikshaadhikari (examiner) for the Vedic Exams conducted by Sankara Mutt Patasalas and our swami performed this task for nearly 55 years before he gracefully let others do that job. Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati Swami continued to be his Guide and Philosopher for more than 50 years. During the time, Sri Kanchi Paramacharya desired that Sri Desikachariar should publish some authoritative works on Dharma Saastra. Desikachariar located the Telugu edition of \\"Pithru Medha Saram\\" originally done by Vaideeka Sarvabhouma Thozhappar, and translated to Devanagari with all Pramanams and a Tamizh vyakyanam.  Awards and recognition  Receiving President award from President of India K.R Narayanan In 2001, Sri Desikachariar was honoured Rashtrapathi Award by the President of India as a Sanskrit Scholar, one of the highest awards given by the Indian State by President K.R.

Hamburg (October 19, 1923 ‚Äì April 15, 2018) was an American psychiatrist whose long career in academic medicine advanced the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. Hamburg was the first African-American to attend Vassar College, and was also the first African-American woman to attend Yale Medical School. Hamburg held professorships at Stanford, Harvard, Mt. Sinai and‚Äîmost recently‚Äîat Weill Cornell Medical College. She was on the President's Commission on Mental Health under President Jimmy Carter. Hamburg was a president of the William T. Grant Foundation, and also directed the child psychiatry divisions at Stanford University and Mount Sinai. She originally was going to go into pediatric medicine, but instead found herself interested in psychiatry. She researched early adolescence, peer counseling, and diabetic children and adolescents. She was a member of the National Academy of Medicine and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She received a Foremother Award for her lifetime of accomplishments from the National Research Center for Women & Families in 2012.\\"2012 Foremother Awards and Health Policy Hero Luncheon\\", National Center for Health Research. Hamburg was married to David A. Hamburg, an academic physician who researched mental health, and the two collaborated on many projects during their careers.  Early life  Beatrix Ann McCleary was born to Minor McCleary and Beatrix Ann Downs on October 19th, 1923 in Jacksonville, Florida. Her father was a surgeon who died when she was young. Shortly after his death, they moved to Long Island in New York, to be with her maternal grandparents. There, she was raised by her widowed mother and her grandparents. Her mother was a school teacher and a social worker while her grandfather was a Methodist minister and her grandmother was a homemaker. Her upbringing had a heavy emphasis on the importance of education.  Career and research  Hamburg had an extensive career in the area of medical psychiatry. She worked in the medical psychiatry departments of Stanford University, Harvard University, Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine, and Weill Cornell Medical College at various points in her life. She focused most of her work on the stages of adolescence and the struggles that adolescents must overcome. She also advocated for peer counseling for teens in the 1960s and 1970s. She believed that adolescents benefit more from advising one another, rather than from an authority figure. They would tutor each other on many issues, such as academics, social issues, mental health and volunteer opportunities. She also researched about the effects of stress and related coping mechanisms with her husband. The stress factors they studied included anything from physical stress and depression to poverty and war. In 2004, they co-authored a book called ‚ÄúLearning to Live Together: Preventing Hatred and Violence in Child and Adolescent Development.‚Äù This book focused on teaching children how to cope with and overcome hatred in healthy ways. She researched about how stress factors like diabetes and teen pregnancy could affect childhood development and subsequently, how this affects them as adults. Hamburg and her husband were in similar career paths and later collaborated on many projects. They received the 2007 Rhoda and Bernard Sarnat International Award in Mental Health from the Institute of Medicine for their long careers in medicine and public service, while in October 2015, the couple received the Pardes Humanitarian Prize in Mental Health by the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation in recognition of their contributions to the understanding of mental health. She received the Foremother Award from the National Center for Health Research in 2012 for her contributions to the community. Publications  *  Personal life  Hamburg met her future husband David, an academic physician who has done mental health research, when they were both students at Yale University in 1948. The two married in 1951, and had two children: Eric, a filmmaker, and Margaret, a physician who served as Food and Drug Administration commissioner under President Barack Obama. Hamburg died as a result of Alzheimer's disease at her daughter's home on April 15, 2018, at the age of 94. References External links * Interview on YouTube. * Photo at Yale University.

Biography =Childhood, teenage years and early career stages= Talit was born in Tel Aviv where he studied at Balfour Elementary School and later at the Agricultural High School at Mikve Israel. He first stepped into the business world with the production, promotion and selling of key chains with celebrity portraits imprinted on them, which were very popular during the 1960s. =A producer and an agent= In 1966 Talit met Haim Saban who was a member of \\"The Lions\\" band. Talit offered Saban to sell key chains with The Lions‚Äô portraits, a move which was their first business partnership. The two of them went on and established a company that represented The Lions and other known Israeli performers of that time like Arik Einstein and The Churchills. In 1977 Talit founded \\"Talit Productions\\". During the 1980s the company produced large concerts and brought international artists to Israel such as Bob Dylan, Tracy Chapman, Dire Straits, Sting, Leonard Cohen, Billy Joel, Boy George, Bryan Adams, Joe Cocker, Julio Iglesias, Duran Duran, David Bowie, The Eurythmics and many others. The company also initiated a line of Opera productions, Musicals, theater shows and sport events. The most prominent of them were The Bolshoy Theater, 42nd Street, Walt Disney‚Äôs World on Ice and the Harlem Globetrotters. Among other things Talit was also responsible for the Night of Love performance which was held in Tzemach, on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, The Magician, a musical based on The Wizard of Oz, which ran since 1994 and had more than 600 shows. During the past few years, Talit has been responsible in a joint production with the Beit Lesin Theater in Israel, for the hit one man show starring Avi Kushnir, Returning the Cave Man. At the same time, the company has represented many artists and Israeli performers from Kaveret and Shalom Hanoch to Avi Kushnir and Danny Sanderson.

Talit also started a co partnership with EM.TV, the German content giant, which brought to the Israeli television children's classics like Maya the Bee, The Muppet Show, Marco, Pinocchio, Niles Holgerson and Pippee Long stocking. Although Talit sold half of the Talit group to the same German Company a few years later he bought back all of it from EM. TV. In 2000 Talit created yet another partnership with Jim Hanson's production company and reserved the Israeli rights for The Muppet Show. A year later, Talit went into sports with his Group Channel that broadcast the games of Maccabi Haifa and Manchester United. In 2003 Talit got the rights of representation for the French channel, TV5, and established the baby channel, Baby TV. In 2007 Fox Broadcasting Company purchased 50% of the ownership of the baby channel from the European firm holding the rights to the channel.

Description Locally known as padagu or salangu among the fisher folks, the masula boat is a large, flat-bottomed, high-sided, open boat with a clumsy design consisting of mango wood planks sewed together with strands of coir which cross over a wadding of the same material, but without frames or ribs, so that the shock due to surf is much reduced. It is specially designed for use where there are no harbours of refuge, chiefly upon the surf-beaten Coromandel Coast of India. It is used in shooting shore seines and also as a cargo lighter. Its range extends along the whole of the eastern coast of India northwards of Cape Calimere. The equivalent type of boats used on the west coast are the beach lighters. Masula boats are generally smaller, although they can be up to 9 m in length. The pattern varies across the coast, namely, padava on the Andhra coast and bar boat in Orissa coast. A variant found in the region between Kakinada and Machilipatnam has ribs inside. The masula boats were mainly used by Europeans in the 19th century before the building of Chennai Port. The dimensions of the masula boat generally varies from 30 to 35 feet in length, 10 to 11 feet in breadth, and 7 to 8 feet in depth. On the Coromandel Coast, it is distinctly short, measuring as short as about 28 feet in length. In the northern region of the coast, chiefly in Godavari and Visakhapatnam districts of the Andhra coast, it exceeds 40 feet in length. However, the beam and the depth measures about 8 feet and 4 feet, respectively, across the region. An oculus is sometimes painted on the bows of the masula boats in the Madras region. They are rowed by a crew varying from 8 to 12 men using bamboo or casuarina paddles, which consist of a board measuring about 10 inches in width and 14 inches in length, fixed at the end of a bamboo or young casuarina tree. They are steered by one or two tindals (coxwains), and two men are constantly kept to bale out the water. Mast and sail are not used in the masula boats as they never go far from the shore.

The season follows Dexter's and Miami Metro's investigations into a string of bizarre ritualistic killings featuring overtly religious apocalyptic symbolism. On November 18, 2011, it was announced that Dexter had been renewed for two more seasons.  Plot  Angel Batista's younger sister Jamie has become Harrison's babysitter, and Dexter Morgan and Debra visit a Catholic pre-school in hopes of signing Harrison up. Meanwhile, Mar√≠a LaGuerta is promoted to Captain after blackmailing Deputy Chief Matthews, whose name was on a prostitute's ledger. Vince Masuka is teaching a group of forensic science students, and after his first choice faints at a crime scene, he asks an attractive female student, Ryan Chambers, to become his intern. Masuka eventually fires Ryan when she steals a painted prosthetic hand from the Ice Truck Killer crime scenes, which shows up on an internet auction site. Masuka quickly hires another intern, video game designer and computer programmer Louis Greene, to fix the problem. Greene claims he made the auction page vanish, but was unable to get the hand back. LaGuerta and Batista have divorced, but try to remain friends; this is further complicated by Matthews' decision to promote Debra to LaGuerta's vacant lieutenant position instead of Batista. Batista thinks he was passed over due to the feud between Matthews and LaGuerta. LaGuerta continuously thwarts Debra's attempts to make a good first impression as the new lieutenant by giving her the wrong advice; however, Debra makes an independent decision to hire Mike Anderson as her replacement, against LaGuerta's recommendation. Joey Quinn proposes to Debra, but she refuses and they break up. Shortly after, Quinn learns of Deb's promotion and surmises that it was her reason for ending their relationship. Quinn begins a long pattern of barhopping, drunkenness, and one-night stands; his unprofessional behavior angers and ultimately endangers Batista, his new partner. A new threat appears in Miami in the form of the Doomsday Killers (or DDK), Professor James Gellar and his student Travis Marshall, who seek to bring about the end of the world through killings based on the Book of Revelation. They leave signs of the Apocalypse including the Alpha and Omega or the Four Horsemen as a cryptic tableau at each crime scene. Meanwhile, Dexter learns of Brother Sam, a former drug addict and murderer who repented and became a minister. He operates a body shop where he employs other ex-convicts, to lead them to crime-free lives. Initially believing Sam to be behind the first Doomsday Killer murder, Dexter decides to kill Sam but is quickly proven wrong and finds himself befriending him. However, Brother Sam is murdered by Nick, one of his trusted ex-convicts; Dexter, going against Brother Sam's wish that Dexter should forgive his killer, murders him. Dexter learns that the Trinity Killer's wife and daughter have been found dead in Nebraska, which Jonah Mitchell reports was the work of his father, Arthur Mitchell. Dexter, the only person who knows the Trinity Killer is dead, suspects that Jonah is following in his father's footsteps and goes to Nebraska to kill Jonah, encouraged by a vision of his brother, Brian Moser, the Ice Truck Killer. However, after confronting Jonah, Dexter learns that his sister committed suicide and Jonah killed his mother in a fit of rage, and wants to die out of guilt. Dexter decides to forgive Jonah and leaves him alive to deal with his demons. Dexter's investigation of the Doomsday Killers leads him to Travis Marshall. Travis says that all he has done was at the request of Professor Gellar, so Dexter asks Travis to help him kill the professor, thinking if he can save Travis then he can save himself. However, Dexter eventually discovers that Professor Gellar had been killed by Travis three years ago and now exists only in the latter's mind. Travis marks Dexter as \\"the Beast\\" and tries to kill him in one of his tableaux, the Lake of Fire, but Dexter escapes and is saved by a passing migrant boat. Finally, Travis kidnaps Dexter's son to use as a sacrifice in his final tableau, thinking that \\"the Beast\\" is dead. Dexter rescues Harrison and knocks Travis unconscious. He takes Travis back to the church where Travis carried out his earlier murders, which Dexter has set up as a kill room. Meanwhile, Jamie starts dating Louis Greene. Greene wants to impress the police force, especially Dexter, and is revealed to have acquired the prosthetic hand from the Ice Truck Killer case, which he mails to Dexter to mess with him after he badmouths a game about serial killers Louis is designing. Debra refuses to yield to pressure to close the case of the overdose death of a prostitute, eventually discovering that Deputy Chief Matthews was present when the woman died. Matthews is forced to retire after LaGuerta leaks the information. Finally, Debra attends department-ordered therapy sessions after being involved in a shoot-out. During her sessions, she begins to realize that she may have romantic feelings for Dexter. She goes to the church (she knew Dexter was doing forensics there) but winds up walking in on him just as he plunges a knife into Travis' chest, to which Dexter responds, \\"Oh God\\".

According to Metacritic, the sixth season of Dexter received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" with a score of 63/100 based on 10 critic reviews. It is, however, the lowest rated season of the series on the site, and the only one to average a score that is below 70. Martin Chilton of The Daily Telegraph gave the first episode of season 6 a score of 1.5 / 5, writing that \\"With each season, the quality of a show that once won an Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe for Hall has been sliding.\\" R.L. Shaffer of IGN wrote of the season that \\"while this season saw a few new twists and turns...it also handed us a fairly hammy story that tied Dexter to an apocalyptic serial killer.\\" However he goes on to write that \\"even in its weak moments, Dexter is a fascinating show to watch\\" and that \\"the subtle seeds of the show's ultimate conclusion...planted throughout season six, are not only compelling, but the real reason to keep watching.\\"  References  External links  * on Showtime * Season six on the Internet Movie Database Category:2011 American television seasons ","title":"Dexter (season 6)"},{"id":"33050287","text":"The Greek Harehound (; FCI No. 214) is a rare breed of dog that only comes in a black and tan color, originally bred as a scent hound for tracking and chasing hare in Southern Greece.  Appearance  The Greek Harehound is a scent hound with a shorthaired black and tan coat. It is a medium-sized dog, weighing between . Males and females should have a height of and at the withers respectively. *Head: The skull, which is relatively flat, is the same or slightly shorter than the muzzle's length. Its forehead is generally broad. *Jaws: The Greek Harehound has powerful jaws. Its teeth should either be in a scissor or pincer bite and evenly spaced. *Eyes: This breed possess bright brown-colored eyes that are medium-sized. The eyes should neither be set too deep or bulging. *Ears: The ears are set high, and should hang down halfway along the head. *Coat: The Greek Harehound has a short, dense coat that has a slightly hard texture. Its coat is usually only black and tan in color, yet a small white patch may be present in some individuals. No trimming or stripping is required. *Tail: The tail's length should not exceed the point of the hock. It is set high, thick at the base and tapering by a little at the tip.  Temperament  The Greek Harehound has a lively, confident and outgoing temperament. These dogs are skilled, fearless hunters, and have a keen sense of smell as well as excellent strength and stamina. Their activity level is high and require regular physical stimulation and a large space to exercise. The Greek Harehound is also devoted to its owner, and generally makes a fine family pet, although they are better with older children. Since the Greek Harehound was originally bred to hunt in packs, it is placid with other dogs, yet they may be wary and suspicious around strangers. Like other scent hound breeds, the Greek Harehound is independent and strong-willed at times. Males in particular require a confident owner to be in charge. These dogs can also be stubborn and impatient at times, so they should be trained at an early age. Positive reinforcements and proper discipline is necessary when training a Greek Harehound and rough handling should be avoided. Due to their original hunting purposes, the Greek Harehound is vocal and extremely loud, and may enjoy chasing small animals and moving things. They may also show destructiveness when bored or left alone for a prolonged period of time. Overall speaking, these dogs can be challenging to train and are not recommended for the inexperienced dog owner as well as apartment life. They are more suitable as hunting dogs than house pets unless the owner is willing to exercise appropriately.  Health  The Greek Harehound is a healthy breed with no known genetic defects. But like other dogs with pendulous ears, their ears are more prone to infections and need to be cleaned frequently. Their life span is around eleven years.

History The Parmesan collections were established in Renaissance times by the Farnese family, with Pope Paul III and cardinal Alessandro Farnese. In 1734 Charles III of Spain had most of the works moved to Naples: some were kept thanks to the intervention of Philip, Duke of Parma, and later the collection was increased with the addition of Greco-Roman findings, donations and restitutions from Naples, as well as through acquisitions under Duke Ferdinand (1758). During the French occupation of Parma (1803‚Äì1814), the works were moved to Paris, returning in 1816. Duchess Marie Louise reordered the collections in the Palazzo della Pilotta and built the hall which now brings her name. She also acquired several noble collections in the duchy to avoid their dispersal.

Retrieved 10 September 2011 With an ever- increasing demand and an increasingly limited supply, certain cities in Mexico risk being void of water. There may be other major global metropolises (e.g. Los Angeles) that have invested more effort and money than Mexico City to bring in water from afar. But there is surely none that has invested as much effort and money to send the water back out. Mexico City's hydrological paradox is that (unlike Los Angeles) it gets more than enough rain to, in theory, keep the 21 million people who live in and around it adequately supplied with water. Its average annual precipitation is about twice that of Los Angeles, and even exceeds that of famously damp London. But most of the rainfall (or hail) comes during the summer, and often during just a few epic storms. So when it is wet, it is much too wet, and the city has built a massive infrastructure over the past five centuries to get the water out quickly. To keep hydrated during the drier months, Mexico City imports water from other regions but mainly just pumps from underground, which causes land subsidence, which makes flooding worse.

He led the 2011 team in receptions and receiving yards, and was tied for the lead in receiving touchdowns. Hemingway was the 2010 and 2011 Big Ten Conference leader in yards per reception, ranking third in all of Division I Football Bowl Subdivision as a senior. He received 2011 All-Big Ten honorable mention and was the 2012 Sugar Bowl Most Outstanding Player. After totaling 593 receiving yards in 2010, Hemingway surpassed this yardage total in his senior season, finishing with a career- best 699 yards. The improvement resulted in Hemingway's league-leading 2010 average of 18.5 yards per reception improving to 20.6 yards per reception in 2011, which was the third-best average per catch in the nation (up from 15th in 2010).

His first receptions came during an October 6 game against Eastern Michigan when he recorded 3 catches for 33 yards. He also recorded a reception in the January 1, 2008 Capital One Bowl against the Florida Gators. He was limited as a true sophomore by mononucleosis which caused him to miss the final eight games of the season for the 2008 team, but did make one start. He received a medical redshirt as a result of the illness. Hemingway posted his first 100-yard reception game, first two-touchdown performance and a career-high five-reception effort in the September 5 season opener for the 2009 team against Western Michigan, during his third career start. He missed the following week's rivalry game against Notre Dame due to an ankle sprain. In November, he played through back problems. As a redshirt sophomore, he totaled 16 receptions and 268 total yards from scrimmage as a receiver. He also served as a punt returner making 10 returns for 86 yards. As a fourth-year junior for the 2010 Wolverines, he posted three 100-yard games and another two-touchdown performance. He did this despite missing the first two games of the season due to a hamstring injury as well as the November 27 regular season finale against Ohio State due to an injury. On October 2, his then career-high 129-yard, three-reception effort included a 70-yard touchdown on the second play of the second half which gave the team a 28‚Äì21 lead.

He was also expected to help pick up the slack created by the full-season suspension of Stonum. As a fifth-year senior, he established a new career high on September 10, 2011, against Notre Dame in the rivalry game and during the first night game ever played at Michigan Stadium, when he recorded three receptions for 165 yards.

At first, the stats for the game were considered official by the Big Ten Conference and the University of Michigan, but the NCAA vacated the statistics for this game because three quarters were not completed. However, at the conclusion of the regular season, the NCAA reversed course and announced that the statistics from the game would be counted in the season totals. Professional career Hemingway was one of 47 wide receivers that participated in the February 22‚Äì28, 2012 NFL Scouting Combine. In the 3 cone drill with a time of 6.59, he ranked first among the wide receivers (26 participated in this event) and 3rd at the combine He ranked first among the wide receivers (26 participated in this event) and seventh overall in the 20-yard shuttle with a time of 3.98. He ranked second among wide receivers (13 participated in this event) and seventh overall in the 60-yard shuttle with a time of 11.16. He ranked 3rd among the wide receivers in the bench press with 21 reps. He ranked 8th among the wide receivers in the standing long jump with a distance of . His time of 4.53 ranked 19th of the 40 wide receivers who participated in the 40-yard dash. He was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the seventh round of the 2012 NFL Draft with the 238th selection overall. He is one of three Michigan Wolverines and 41 Big Ten players drafted. On May 11, 2012, he signed a four-year contract. On August 31, Hemingway was cut. He was initially signed to the practice squad but was released to make room for Rich Ranglin on September 3 before being resigned to replace Ranglin on September 8. On December 29 (the day before the last game of the 2012 NFL season), the Chiefs placed Terrance Copper on injured reserve and elevated Hemingway from injured reserve. During the 2013 preseason, Hemingway led the Chiefs in receptions and touchdowns. He seemed to have moved into the fourth wide receiver position behind Dwayne Bowe, Donnie Avery, and Dexter McCluster. In the 2013 Chiefs season opener, he caught a touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars, who had his college freshman season quarterback Chad Henne and his redshirt senior season quarterback Denard Robinson on their roster. The reception, which came from Alex Smith, was Hemingway's first in the NFL. Hemingway had a three-reception game that included the game's opening score on December 1 against the Denver Broncos. In the final game of the season, he had 5 receptions for 45 yards, giving him 13 receptions and 125 yards for the season. Hemingway also posted 2 receptions for the Chiefs in the 2013‚Äì14 NFL playoffs against Indianapolis. Hemingway injured his hamstring in week 7 of the 2014 NFL season against the San Diego Chargers on October 19. On September 1, 2015, the Chiefs cut Hemingway.

History A batch of college freshmen performing Chinese boxing on a Chinese college field during military training. Military training traces back to the feudal era in China. According to the Book of Rites and Zhou, the Western Zhou Dynasty had two levels of studies: guoxue and xiangxue. The University in the Western Zhou Dynasty focused on martial arts and teachers were military officers. The major content of military training was learning archery and driving chariots. This is the earliest known instance of military training. Later dynasties continued the practice. During the Qing Dynasty the Baoding Military Academy was set up for training officers in modern industrial-era warfighting techniques. During the Kuomintang reign, the Whampoa Military Academy was organized for officer training and boy scouts training also existed. In July 1955, the first military service law was issued, which first required high school students and undergraduates to take military training. That winter, Beijing Sport University and Beijing Iron and Steel Engineering Institute pilot projects were conducted, followed by 12 higher education institutes. More than 10,000 students were trained. From 1955 to 1957, the Ministry of Education and Ministry of National Defence authorized 127 schools to carry out military training. The number of trained students reached over 70,000. At that time, higher education institutes focused more on training technical reserve officers, while high schools paid more attention to basic military training. In the early 1960s first grade students in 38 institutes of higher learning and 70 senior high schools and trade schools from 53 cities experimented with military training with the authority of the State Council. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the government expanded military training given political stability and a growing economy. As of 2012, almost 500 universities and colleges and 3000 middle schools provided military training. Purpose *To promote the spirit of patriotism and improve the idea of defence *To develop good will and characters *To shape collectivism *To promote the Communist Party of China *To reinforce the ideology of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics *To benefit later learning Student training A serviceman taking part in the Chaozhou Vocational Technical School military instruction in 2014. According to the Law of the People's Republic of China on National Defense Education, pupils, middle school students and undergraduates should have military training when term opens or after National Day. Until high school, students practise basic formation and movement. High school students drill and study emergency evacuation, as well as national defence. Undergraduates take formal military training and emergency evacuation. Drill and formation Formation training (ÈòüÂΩ¢ËÆ≠ÁªÉ) includes stand at attention (Á´ãÊ≠£), stand at ease (Á®çÊÅØ), footwork (Ê≠•Ê≥ï), salute (Êï¨Á§º) and review.

It was fought between Mexico and their O'odham allies against American forces in April 1857. Due to the outbreak of the Reform War in Mexico, the rebel Ygnacio Pesqueira invited the American politician Henry A. Crabb to colonize the northern frontier region in the state of Sonora, on the basis that the colonists would help Pesqueira fight in the civil war and against the Apache. However, when Crabb arrived in Mexico, his command was attacked and ultimately defeated. Some 50 survivors of the battle, out of about 85 men, were murdered by the Mexicans. Background The Reform War was a religious civil war, one of many between Mexico's rival conservative and liberal factions. Ignacio Pesqueira fought for the liberals in Sonora, against the state soldiers of the conservative Governor Manuel Mar√≠a G√°ndara. General Crabb was a former State Senator from California, as well as a former United States Army officer, but his journey to Mexico in 1857, known as the Crabb Expedition, was of a private nature and did not involve the American government or the military. It was in the fall of 1856, after Crabb lost an election to decide the next senator of California, when he came into contact with Pesqueira through his Mexican wife. Crabb accepted Pesqueira's offer who authorized the general to bring 1,000 colonists. But by the time the expedition left for Mexico, the general had recruited only about 100 men. Other volunteers organized to follow Crabb into Sonora either abandoned the march or were attacked by the Mexicans. Starting out from San Diego in January 1857, the expedition went to the Lower Colorado River and then entered New Mexico Territory, now Arizona, and headed directly for the Gila River where they gathered livestock for several weeks. The location of the camp is now known as the Filibusters Camp. In March they went south for the Tucson area to recruit more men. From Tucson the expedition continued further south to Altar, where they would meet with Pesqueira and his rebels. By the time Crabb reached Sonora, the rebels had already defeated G√°ndara's troops and forced him into exile. G√°ndara later sought refuge in Tucson. Conflict The Crabb expedition first made contact with the rebels at Caborca, having diverged a bit from Altar, their original destination. Now that he no longer needed the American colonists, Pesqueira was criticised by his followers for accepting to use Americans in the war. Because of this, the rebels decided to destroy the expedition. Crabb sent the prefect of Altar a message saying that he had come in peace but the message was either ignored or failed to arrive in time to influence the situation.United States Department of State, pg. 69-70 At Caborca the Americans became involved in a skirmish which took eight days to finish according to George N. Cardwell who wrote an account of the affair in a letter to his brother J. W. Cardwell. Massacre George Cardwell, an associate of some of the expedition's members, wrote that at the conclusion of the battle, in which 25 Americans were killed, the remaining 58 were separated into groups of ten and executed by firing squad. Crabb's men took up positions inside an adobe building but it was later set on fire by an O'odham warrior, forcing their surrender. Cardwell's letter says that 87 Americans were killed in all, including General Crabb, though other accounts say 77 Americans were killed in the massacre itself, not including those who died during the fighting. In Cardwell's letter, he includes a list of 55 of the Americans who died and says that among them were California's most respectable citizens. Cardwell wrote that the Mexicans lost 189 men out of about 1,200. This number included dozens of O'odham. The Mexican commander, Hilario Gabilondo, who had received instructions from Pesqueira to shoot the prisoners, refused to carry out his orders and left with a fourteen-year-old American boy named Evans. Evans was raised by Gabilondo and later became a Mexican customs inspector at the international border with the United States. General Crabb was allowed to write a letter to his wife before being executed by a firing squad of 100 men, after which his head was cut off and preserved in a jar. The letter was given to one of two men who left the expedition before it crossed the international border between Arizona and Sonora. At the time the Crabb Expedition was regarded by many Mexicans and Americans as being an outfit of filibusters, organized to conquer Mexican territory, but it was sanctioned by the rebel government in Mexico, which would eventually win the Reform War in 1861. Cardwell himself wrote that \\"Mr. Crabb left here about January last, ostensibly for the purpose of mining in the Gadsden purchase, and settling there; but really intending to conquer Sonora, and in process of time add it to the slave states.\\"United States Department of State, pg. 71 Aftermath The conflict was not over, however. Cardwell writes that \\"some days\\" after the Caborca affair, a group of 20 Mexicans crossed the border, from San Juan, into Arizona and captured four men of Crabb's party who were resting in a general store due to illness. These four were executed. Shortly thereafter, twenty of Crabb's volunteers launched an expedition to relieve General Crabb. Led by Major R. N. Wood and Captain Granville Henderson Oury of Tucson, the rescue party was on the Mexican side of the border when about 200 Mexicans attacked them near the location where the four sickly men had been captured. After \\"severe fighting\\", these twenty recruits successfully made it back across the border. A squad of sixteen other recruits was not so fortunate, and after crossing the border were intercepted by the same 200 men who had encountered Major Wood and Captain Oury. These menamong whom was Freeman McKinney, the San Jose law partner of the notorious Parker H. French. surrendered without a fight but were executed like the others. Of the Americans who participated in the Battle of Caborca, only one or two men survived, including the fourteen-year-old Evans. Accounts differ as to the existence of a second survivor. In California and New Mexico Territory, news of the massacre created a clamor for revenge against the Mexicans but the incident was eventually put aside and forgotten. Some time later, Gabilondo, who had refused to kill the American colonists, was nearly lynched in Tucson by an angry mob, but survived apparently because of his innocence.United States Department of State, pg. 72 See also * Goliad massacre * Dawson massacre * Mier expedition * Republic of Sonora * William Walker (filibuster) * Capture of Tucson (1846) * Crawford Affair * Parker H.

Theorized in response to the repressiveness and rigidity of contemporary liberal democratic society, the theory of empowered democracy envisions a more open and more plastic set of social institutions through which individuals and groups can interact, propose change, and effectively empower themselves to transform social, economic, and political structures. The key strategy is to combine freedom of commerce and governance at the local level with the ability of political parties at the central level to promote radical social experiments that would bring about decisive change in social and political institutions. The theory of empowered democracy has received widespread critical acclaim. It has been hailed as the only such constructive vision of society in critical legal studies, and the term has since seeped into the mainstream media, even if the theory has not. Meanwhile, Cornel West, Perry Anderson, Richard Rorty, and numerous other prominent scholars have published detailed‚Äîand, very often, admiring‚Äîessays on Unger's project. Overview In practice, the theory would involve radical developments in politics at the center, as well as social innovation in localities. At the center, by bestowing wide ranging revisionary powers to those in office, it would give political parties the ability to try out concrete yet profound solutions and proposals. It would turn partisan conflicts over control and uses of governmental power into an opportunity to question and revise the basic arrangements of social life through a rapid resolution of political impasse. In local communities, empowered democracy would make capital and technology available through rotating capital funds, which would encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. Citizens rights include individual entitlements to economic and civic security, conditional and temporary group claims to portions of social capital, and destabilization rights, which would empower individuals or groups to disrupt organizations and practices marred by routines of subjugation that normal politics have failed to disrupt.This summary is drawn from Policy points Alongside the philosophy of empowered democracy, Unger has laid out concrete policy proposals in areas of economic development, education, civil society, and political democracy.These policy points are taken from Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, The self awakened: pragmatism unbound (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2007), and Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, What Progressives Should Propose. September 2011 * On economic development, Unger has noted that there are only two models for a national economy available to us today: the US model of business control of government, and the northeast Asian model of top down bureaucratic control of the economy. Citing the need for greater imagination on the issue, he has offered a third model that is decentralized, pluralistic, participatory, and experimental. This would take the form of an economy encouraging small business development and innovation that would create large scale self-employment and cooperation. The emphasis is not on the protection of big business as the main sectors of the economy, but the highly mobile and innovative small firm. * Unger links the development of such an economy to an education system that encourages creativity and empowers the mind, not one that he now sees geared for a reproduction of the family and to put the individual in service of the state. He proposes that such a system should be run locally but have standards enforced through national oversight, as well as a procedure in place to intervene in the case of the failing of local systems. * Unger's critique of and alternative to social programs goes to the heart of civil society. The problem we are faced with now, he claims, is that we have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy. * Unger's proposal for political democracy calls for a high energy system that diminishes the dependence of change upon crisis. This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock though the enabling of the party in power to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political process and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.

The collection includes works by Turner, Constable, and Landseer. The donation of his collection to Bury was the impetus for the foundation and construction of the museum and art gallery. The building was designed by the Manchester firm of Woodhouse and Willoughby. Donations of artworks quickly followed its opening on 9 October 1901 by the Earl of Derby, including donations from the town's Member of Parliament James Kenyon. In 2005, a ¬£1.2 million refurbishment was carried out, designed to provide a brand new museum, art gallery and library all under one roof.

It consists of the Multifunction Vehicle Bus (MVB) inside each vehicle and of the Wire Train Bus (WTB) to connect the different vehicles. The TCN components have been standardized in IEC 61375.  Usage  The TCN is used in most of the modern train control systems usually connecting the vehicles with an 18-pin UIC 558. * Deutsche Bahn: ICE T, ICE-TD, ICE 3 and TRAXX AC2 P160 * Swiss Federal Railways: IC2000 and EW IV * Austrian Federal Railways: All Railjet and Talent trains  Wire train bus  The wire train bus has been designed for international passenger trains with variable composition, consisting of up to 22 vehicles. The medium consists of a duplicated shielded twisted pair cable, which runs in the UIC cables between the vehicles. The connector between the vehicles is the 18-pole UIC connector. Since connectors are exposed and can oxidize, a current pulse is applied at connection establishment to evaporate the oxide layer, called fritting. The standard connector for the WTB nodes is a DIN 9 pin connector. The physical level uses RS-485 levels at 1 Mbit/s data rate. The encoding uses a Manchester II code and a HDLC frame protocol with proper voltage balancing to avoid DC components in the galvanic isolation transformers. The Manchester decoder uses a phase/quadrature demodulation (not RS485, that operates with zero-crossings) which allows to span 750 m under worst-case conditions, especially when only the two extremity vehicles are equipped, as is the case with multiple traction for freight trains. No repeaters are foreseen since vehicles in between can have discharged batteries. A unique property of the WTB is the train inauguration (Zugtaufe) in which the newly connected vehicles receive an address in sequence and can identify the vehicle side (called port and starboard like in the marine) so that doors open on the correct side. Up to 32 addresses can be dynamically allocated. When two train compositions join, the addresses are reallocated to form a new composition of vehicles with a sequential address. Vehicles without WTB node (\\"conduction vehicles\\") are not counted. The frames have a maximum payload of 1024 bits. The WTB operates cyclically to provide deterministic operation, with a period of 25 ms, used mainly for the traction control. The WTB also supports sporadic data transmission for diagnostics. The content of the periodic and sporadic frames is governed by the UIC 556 standard. Since frame size is limited, a version of TCP with reduced overhead was used for message segmenting and reassembly, that at the same time allows to cope with changes in composition, called RTP (Real-Time Protocol).  History  The WTB was derived from the German DIN bus developed by ABB Henschel (now Bombardier). It benefited from the phase/quadrature decoding provided by Italy and from an improved train inauguration provided by Switzerland, based on the experience with the FSK multiple traction bus of ABB Secheron, Geneva used in the SBB freight trains. The physical layer of MVB shows similarities with the WorldFIP field bus (EN 50170 part 4) - its \\"voltage mode\\" did use 1 Mbit/s and a maximum of 32 stations on the bus with a maximum length of 750 meters, the use of FIP transceivers was studied early in the TCN evaluation, but the Phase/Quadrature decoding was used instead.  Multifunction vehicle bus  The multifunction vehicle bus connects individual nodes within a vehicle or in a closed train set. Unlike the WTB there is no requirement on a single international connector standard for the vehicle bus inside a coach, locomotive or train set ‚Äì instead there are three predefined media and connector classes. # OGF (Optical glass fibres) uses 240 Œºm fibers for a line distance of 2000 m, # EMD (Electrical Medium Distance) uses shielded twisted pair with RS 485 transmitters and transformers for galvanical isolation), for a length reaching 200 m and # ESD (Electrical Short Distance) uses a simple backplane wiring without galvanic isolation, for which case the cable may be up to 20 m in length. The plugs and sockets are the same as used by Profibus (with two 9-pin Sub-D sockets per electrical device). For OGF, the media sources are connected by repeaters (signal generators) being joined on a central star coupler A repeater is also used for the transition from one medium to another. There is no inauguration, the addresses are statically allocated. The number of addressable devices depends on the configuration of the vehicle bus ‚Äì there may be up to 4095 simple sensors/actuators (Class I) and up to 255 programmable stations (Class 2, with configuration slots). The physical level is using transmissions at a 1.5 Mbit/s data rate using Manchester II encoding. The maximum distance is determined on the restriction of a maximum allowed reply delay of 42.7 ¬µs (where for longer distances a second mode is used that allows up to 83.4 Œºs with reduced throughput, in case MVB is used for switchgear on the track side) while most system parts communicate with a response time of a typical 10¬µs. History MVB was derived from the P215 bus developed by Brown Boveri Cie, Switzerland (now ABB), incorporating the publisher/subscriber principle from early field busses (DATRAS). Back in 1984, IEC TC57 defined the requirement specifications for busses to be used in electrical substation in collaboration with IEC SC65C. MVB presents many similarities with the FIP field bus (originally \\"Flux d'Information vers le Processus\\", relabeled as Factory Instrumentation Protocol and later Flux Information Protocol) that was developed in the French NFC 46602 standard series.,WorldFIP since both stemmed from the same IEC TC57 specifications. This explains why MVB and FIP have similar operation (cyclic and event- driven), only the arbitration method in case of multiple access differs, as MVB used a binary bisection mode relying of collision detection while FIP piggy-backed a \\"look-at-me\\" bit over periodic data. Efforts to merge FIP and MVB failed at the stubbornness of the two parties. MVB, Profibus and WorldFIP were proposed as a substation bus in IEC TC57, but to avoid parallel solutions, IEC TC57 decided that none will be used and favored Ethernet as a common denominator. The MVB frames are not compatible with IEC 61158-2 fieldbus frames as it omits most of the preamble synchronization (which is not required if zero-crossing detection is possible). The paradox situation is that the IEC 61158 field bus and MVB physical layer were developed by the same persons in IEC TC57. The difference came from the fieldbus physical layer which assumes a phase-locked loop to decode the Manchester data, requiring a preamble to synthonize the decoder, while MVB operated principally with optical fibres where this method is useless, MVB's decoding relies on zero- crossing detectors and Manchester pattern recognition. However most the modern development and test equipment can equally communicate WTB/MVB frames as well as Profibus frames on the line as the telegram structure similar to Profibus. The WorldFIP connectors found usage in train equipment in France and North America (by Bombardier) until a joined effort on a common UIC train bus was started (with Siemens and other industry partners) that led to the WTB/MVB standard in late 1999. = Alternate vehicle buses = The MVB standard was introduced to replace the multitude of field buses in the train equipment. Despite the advantages of the MVB field bus, many vehicle buses are still built from CANopen, WorldFIP (in France), LonWorks (in the USA) and Profibus components. While the WorldFIP, CANopen, Lonworks and Profinet are controlled by international manufacturer associations targeting a wide range of application, MVB was tailored to the rolling stock application, with the goal of plug-compatibility, and therefore allows no options. This was intentional as the fight between the field busses raged in the 1990s and the decision of the IEC that any of the eight field busses was a standard did not help plug- compatibility. MVB modules are more expensive than for instance CANopen or LonWorks components. This is not due to the communication technology: most devices implement the MVB protocol machine in a small area of an FPGA which is today anyhow present, and the costliest component remains the connector. But railways certification is costly and not always needed for uncritical applications such as comfort and passenger information. When total cost of ownership is considered, the cost of the hardware elements can easily be outweighed by additional engineering costs in the railways market with its small series. In the USA, the IEEE RTVISC evaluated both MVB and LON as vehicle and train bus. The IEEE finally decided to standardize both in IEEE 1374, with a clear separation of tasks: MVB for critical operation such as traction control and signalling in the driver's cab, and LON for uncritical and slow data transfer, but low-cost connections such as passenger displays and diagnostics. This separation is not always observed. Additionally more and more components are added to rail vehicles that need far more bandwidth than any field bus can provide (e.g. for video surveillance), so switched Ethernet IEEE 802.3 with 100 Mbit/s is being introduced into train sets (according to the EN 50155 profile). Still all the alternate vehicle buses are connected to the Wire Train Bus. MVB is similar to FlexRay, both have the \\"process data\\", which is called \\"static segment\\" in FlexRay, and \\"message data\\", which is the \\"dynamic segment\\" and are driven by a fixed TDMA scheme. Running FlexRay with 2.5 Mbit, an RS485 physical layer and only one \\"coldstarter\\" would lead to a very similar behavior in respect to the application. Despite the similarities, no rail-manufacturer has considered FlexRay, since they valuated a common solution higher than a multitude of better busses. Conversely, in 1999, the automotive industry evaluated MVB (in an extended 24 Mbit/s version), but dropped it because of the costs, which should be unreasonably low for the mass-market of millions of vehicles.

Painted in oil, umber and white lead pigments on a poplar wood panel, its attribution remains controversial, with several experts attributing the work to a student of Leonardo. The painting has been admired for its captivating beauty, mysterious demeanor, and mastery of sfumato. There is no real consensus on the painting's subject, date, history or purpose. It shows an unknown woman gazing downward while her hair fills the frame behind her. No theory of the subject has been widely accepted, but many have been proposed, such as the painting being a sketch for an uncompleted painting of Saint Anne, a study for the London version of The Virgin of the Rocks or Leda and the Swan painting, now a lost work . The painting was recorded in a 1826 sale of Gaetano Callani's collection to the Galleria Nazionale di Parma, the museum the currently houses it, but proof of its existence may date back to 1531. Most scholars attribute it as a work by Leonardo da Vinci and it has been listed as such in various major Leonardo exhibitions. Name The painting has no formal name but is best known by the nickname La Scapigliata (), in reference to the tousled and waving hair of the subject. It has been known by various names in addition to La Scapigliata, including Head of a Woman, Head of a Young Woman, Head of a Young Girl, Head and Shoulders of a Woman, Portrait of a Maiden and Female Head. Description Detail of sfumato in La Scapigliata The work's true intent is unknown and it has been variously referred to as a sketch, a drawing or a painting. Due to the use of paint, it is correctly described as a painting, but scholars continue to discuss its sketch and drawing like qualities, often liking it to early works such as the Adoration of the Magi and Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, as well as later ones like The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist. Art historian Carmen Bambach suggests that it should be described as a \\"brush drawing\\", or a \\"painted sketch\\". The painting is done on a small poplar wood panel with oil, umber, and white lead pigments. It portrays the unfinished outline of a young woman whose face gently gazes downward while her loosely drawn dishevelled hair waves in the air behind her. The woman's eyes are half-closed and completely ignoring of the outside world and viewer, while her mouth is slightly shaped into an ambiguous smile, evocative of the Mona Lisa. Other than her face that takes up most of the painting, the rest of the painting is barely even sketched in, with a primed but unpainted background. The differences in the face and the rest of the painting are effectively blended by a mastery of sfumato. Art historian Alexander Nagel notes that the sfumato results in the shadows concealing any strokes or marks. Nagel also points out how the shadows are softened by careful lighting around them, such as on the left side of the jaw. The appeal in this contrast of the unfinished and finished parts has provoked speculation that the painting is not incomplete, and was left in an unfinished state on purpose. The subject of the painting is unknown and no theory has proved convincing to modern scholars. One theory is that the painting is a study for Leonardo's lost painting of Leda and the Swan, but this is discredited by existing copies of the painting showing Lena with hair more elaborate than that of the woman in La Scapigliata. Other claims are that the painting was a sketch, like The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist, for a painting of Saint Anne that was never completed, or a study for the London version of the Virgin of the Rocks. According to experts at the Galleria Nazionale di Parma, the subject of the painting may be an anonymous woman. Attribution and date La Scapigliata is thought to have been made around the same time as Leonardo's cartoon The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist It is generally agreed by modern scholars that La Scapigliata is by Leonardo da Vinci. The attribution is not as widely accepted as other debated Leonardo paintings, like his Ginevra de' Benci, Portrait of a Musician, Lady with an Ermine and Saint John the Baptist and is ignored by some art historians, with many refraining from even commenting on it. Art historians, Martin Kemp and Frank Z√∂llner leave the work out of their catalogues of Leonardo's paintings, while museum curator Luke Syson proposes the painting to be by one of the many students of Leonardo. Doubts concerning the painting's attribution are not recent. In 1896, museum director claimed it had been forged by its former owner, Gaetano Callani, which caused it to be re-attributed as \\"by the school of Leonardo\\". In 1924 this claim was challenged by the art historian Adolfo Venturi, who asserted that the work was by Leonardo, and who revealed evidence that sought to link the work with the House of Gonzaga. The attribution to Leonardo was further advocated by Carlo Pedretti, who connected the painting to Isabella d'Este, a patron of Leonardo. Most scholars have since accepted the work to be an autograph Leonardo, but modern critics such as art historian Jacques Franck continue to question its authenticity. Franck, basing her doubts on the irregular proportions and strangely shaped skull of the subject, has proposed the painting to be by Leonardo's student Giovanni Boltraffio. She has cited the similarity between La Scapigliata and Boltraffio's work Heads of the Virgin and Child. Bernardino Luini, another student of Leonardo, has also been suggested as the artist, the evidence being based on his depictions of female faces. Major exhibitions at the Louvre (2003), Milan (2014‚Äì2015), New York (2016), Paris (2016), Naples (2018) and the Louvre (2019‚Äì2020), have all displayed the painting as being by Leonardo. The painted is usually dated c. 1506‚Äì1508 based on stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo, namely The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist and the London Virgin of the Rocks. In 2016, Bambach dated the painting to c. 1500‚Äì1505 since she believes Leonardo was commissioned by Agostino Vespucci at this time. History Portrait of Isabella d'Este, proposed patron of La Scapigliata, by Leonardo da Vinci (1499‚Äì1500) No records of a commission survive for the painting, but its intimacy suggests it may have been for a private patron. Bambach cites a note by Florentine official Agostino Vespucci that mentions Leonardo, and describes the appeal and beauty of the unfinished bust of Venus by the famous ancient Greek painter Apelles. She believes that La Scapigliata may be the result of Vespucci commissioning Leonardo to make a work along the same lines. A more widely accepted theory is that the work was commissioned by a known patron of Leonardo and member of the Gonzaga family, Isabella d'Este, who had asked Leonardo for a painting of a Madonna for her private studio in 1501. Isabella d'Este probably gifted the painting to her son Federico II for his wedding with Margaret Paleologa. This is evidenced by a 1531 letter from the secretary of the Mantuan Gonzaga family, Ippolito Calandra, who suggests that a painting with very similar features to La Scapigliata be hung in the bedroom of Federico II and Margaret Paleologa. A 1531 inventory of Gonzaga family's art collection in the ducal palace also records a painting that could be La Scapigliata. Another inventory from 1627 almost certainly refers La Scapigliata and is likely the origin of the nickname since the record describes it as: \\"A painting depicts the head of a dishevelled woman... by Leonardo da Vinci.\\" This record implies that it was not sold in a large 1626‚Äì1627 sale of paintings from the Gonzaga family to Charles I of England. It was possibly stolen in July 1630 when an imperial army of 36,000 Landsknecht mercenaries, under the pay of Ferdinand II, sacked the city. The next and first certain record of the painting is in 1826, when Francesco Callani offered the collection his father, the Parmesan artist Gaetano Callani, for sale to the Gallery in the Accademia di Belle Arti di Parma. In a list of the works in the collection for the director of the of the Gallery, Paolo Toschi, La Scapigliata appears listed as \\"A head of Madonna painted in chiaroscuro.\\" The sale implies that it entered the collection of Gaetano Callani at some point, probably during his 1773‚Äì1778 stay in Milan, but other than being in Milan, there is no information on the painting's whereabouts before then. The sale took place in 1839, but La Scapigliata itself entered the gallery of Palatine Gallery of Parma (Now Galleria nazionale di Parma), where it was listed as \\"The head of Leonardo da Vinci\\" and described by Toschi as \\"a very rare work to find today. It has been housed in the National Gallery of Parma ever since. Interpretation Many theories have been proposed about the work's intended purpose and meaning, which the Galleria Nazionale di Parma suggests is due to the ambiguity in the work's 'painted-drawing' demeanor. Scholars at the Metropolitan Museum of Art note that the contrast between the subject's sculptural and detailed face with her fragmentary hair, shoulders and neck evokes a similar contrast between intensity and freedom. Scholars at the Galleria nazionale di Parma have interpreted this contrast as a feminist representation of powerful but elegant femininity. The work has been recognized as the apex of Leonardo-esque sfumato. Nagel notes the attentive detail to masterful shadowing and lighting. Nagel compares La Scapigliata with head studies by Leonardo's teacher, Andrea del Verrocchio, noting the similar approach and attention given to the shading, and that both Verrocchio's studies of female heads and Leonardo's La Scapigliata seem to 'know' that the edge of the panel exists. He concludes that It is uncertain what access Leonardo would have had to Pliny the Elder's Natural History, but in 2016 Bambach suggested that La Scapigliata may have been inspired by an anecdote from it. Pliny refers to an unfinished painting of Venus of Cos by the famous ancient Greek painter Apelles that was admired even though it was unfinished. Bambach cites a note from Agostino Vespucci that mentions both Leonardo and this story, and claims that Leonardo was inspired to achieve the same result as Apelles.

History Alcoletge was first mentioned in documents from the year 1118, in an agreement between Ram√≥n Berenguer III and Arnau Berenguer of Anglesola. This Count of Barcelona received the castle from Alcoletge de Ibn Hilal (Avifelel), the Almoravid from Lleida. It is precisely the name of this document (al-Kolaia) from which the town received its name. It seems that there was a Visigothic village in the area that was the foundation of the Muslim nucleus. The parish was documented in 1168 and in 1200 it formed part of Lleida. Part of the municipality belonged to the monastery of Junqueras of Barcelona until the end of the feudal system. During the Catalan Revolt the castle was destroyed and the sixteenth-century shrine which depended on the Junqueras convent, Barcelona, was sacked and in 1665 the location was listed as deserted. The Spanish War of Succession in 1707 caused a second disaster and a second depopulation. The city council of Lleida, which emerged from the Nueva Planta decrees in 1719, appointed a mayor from within the criminal jurisdiction of the location and municipal area of Alcoletge, and this served as the origin of the independent municipality. Symbols The coat of arms of Alcoletge is defined by the following blazon: > Losanjado Shield: gold, an open saber castle within two 2 saber elms. For a > bell, a mural crown of the people. It was approved on March 12, 1991. Culture The parish church is dedicated to St. Michael. It was built in the eighteenth century, in the neoclassical style, taking the new cathedral of Lleida as a model. It has three naves covered with a groin vault and an ornate fa√ßade. In 1936 a Baroque altarpiece from the Old Cathedral of Lleida was destroyed and is kept in this temple. There is no trace of the old building, which was located on the hill overlooking the village. Arabic pottery from the medieval period was found here. There is also no remnants of the Renaissance manor (Cal Mo) which was used by the Jonqueres nuns and which had a beautiful gallery with arches in the back. Celebrations Alcoletge celebrates its major festival in May. The second festival takes place in September. Economy The main economic activity is agriculture, with the cultivation of fruit trees, especially pear and apple being the most common. Agricultural cooperative are also present. In recent years, the proximity to the capital (Lleida) has determined the working life of the residents, while agriculture remains the backbone of the economy of the municipality. Cultivated land, some 1,100 ha, represents two-thirds of the municipality. All crops are irrigated, thanks to the Fontanet irrigation and other sources such as from the Segre River, and Canals, which carries water from the Urgell canal.

Population According to data from 2006, Anglesola had a population of 1303 inhabitants. History Anglesola was first mentioned in 1079, in a document in which Ram√≥n Berenguer II and Berenguer Ram√≥n II ceded the lands to Berenguer Gombau for its repopulation. It became the center of the barony of Anglesola, decisive in the Catalan reconquest. The lineage of the barony took the name of the castle. From the twelfth century, it was divided into three branches: the Lords of Vallbona, Lords of Bellpuig and Lords of Anglesola. In 1097, the church in the village was cited for the first time. Sancha, widow of Berenguer Gombau, gave the temple to the Solsona clergy. In 1139, Anglesola had a hospital for the poor, founded by Arnau Berenguer of Anglesola and directed by the abbot of the Poblet monastery. The Anglesola lineage became extinct in 1382 and Martin I gave the barony to Pere of Benviure, a protege of Queen Maria de Luna. Later it passed to the Erills, whose lineage disappeared in 1475. Finally, it ended in the hands of the counts of Perelada, who had the lordship until the end of the old regime. Culture There are no remains of the castle nor of the primitive church. The present parish church is dedicated to St. Paul of Narbonne and is believed to have been built in the same place where the original was. It is from the fifteenth century, with a single nave and a lateral and choir aisles. The cover is made of a combination of vaults and edge alongside the barrel vaults. This mixture of styles is present in other fifteenth century Catalan buildings. The bell tower, a square, is attached to the walls. The top is closed with a balustrade. On each side of the entrance, there are two Romanesque images representing Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Both are dated in the twelfth century and are the work of Ramon de Bianya. In the fourteenth century a stone altar was added to the church dedicated to the Virgin which is kept in a museum in Boston. In the temple there is also a fifteenth-century altarpiece dedicated to Santa Ana originating from a chapel that was in the ancient gateway city. There is also a polychrome stone carving from the fourteenth century which depicts St. Paul. Economy The main economic activity is agriculture. Primarily fruit crops are cultivated, mainly apples and pears, but there are dry crops. The village has an industrial estate that in 2007 was home to twelve companies.

The village, the only settlement in the municipality, is situated on the banks of the Corb river. The main part of the village is built up a hillside on the north bank of the river. The population in 2011 was 320. History A street in Guimer√†, 1916 Guimer√†'s development originated in the push by Christian forces from the north to recover the Iberian peninsula from Islam. It is believed the village is named after a Visigothic person named something like Wigmar, who may have founded the settlement. Its big castle with a high watchtower indicates its strategic importance. Guimer√†'s first mention in extant records was in the year 1038, in a legal deed regarding its castle. The town grew downhill from the castle towards the river, and eventually spread to the other bank. Guimer√†'s population reached a peak of 1606 in 1857, but, in common with the general population decline in the surrounding area, has steadily decreased to 320 in 2011. A large number of the buildings in the village are now holiday homes.

A local agricultural cooperative produces olive oil under the Garrigues appellation, and wine under the Costers del Segre appellation. Tourism also plays a significant role. Main sights Carrer de la Capella. The tunnel on the right is the start of Carrer del Cacao. Guimer√† is noted for its well-preserved mediaeval layout and limestone buildings, which are densely clustered together on the hillside, linked by narrow streets, stairways, and tunnels. Much of the town wall and several of its gates still remain. The castle, in a commanding position overlooking the village, dates from the 11th century.

In 1940 a new altarpiece was created by the architect Josep Maria Jujol. Located 2 km west of the village stands the religious sanctuary of La Bovera, dating from the 13th century, which is still in active use. The ruined convent of Vallsanta is located 1.5 km west of Guimer√† village, close to La Bovera. It was founded by Cistercian nuns who moved from their previous site at La Bovera in the 13th century. It was abandoned around the year 1600. It contains a variety of architectural styles from the Romanesque and Gothic periods. In 1975, the Spanish Government registered the historic centre of Guimer√† as a protected national monument, followed by its castle in 1988.

As previously mentioned, the Visigothic monastery of Santa Grata is the origin, of the current town of Senterada, as a population must have formed around the monastery, which, when the original monastery disappeared, adopted its church as a parish church. Furthermore, Senterada sits was a crossroads of important communication routes and, the confluence of the B√≤ssia and Flamisell rivers, helped growth of th town. In the fire of 1381, Senterada is mentioned within the barony of Bellera. In 1553, 5 fires took place in Sancterada. In 1718 it had passed into the hands of the barons of Sant Vicen√ß, like the whole barony of Bellera, and the Dukes of Cardona. In 1831, at the end of the Old Regime, it was the domain of the Marquis of La Manresana, heir to the Belleras and the Sant Vicen√ßs. In all the historic documents the town of Lar√©n always appears with Senterada.

Plot summary  This book follows Mark Girland's next adventure after Have This One on Me. John Dorey asks Mark Girland to fetch a blue movie tape from Paris without telling him who the girl in the tape is. Girland, while working out his plan finds out, to his utter surprise, that the girl features in the tape is the daughter of Sherman, a man who is running for the Presidential election in the United States. His daughter, Gilly threatens to expose the tapes to ruin her father's chances of becoming the President of the United States.

Tunnelbacken is located about 4 km from Ume√• centrum. Ume√• University and the University Hospital of Ume√• are both located less than 1 km from the area. There are a total of 831 apartments in the area, 180 single rooms and another 70 apartments are for students.  History  The first inhabitants of √Ölidbacken were three soldiers. They each lived in their own soldier cottage, built in 1695. The king Karl XI had imposed \\"√ñns by\\" to hold the crown with the three soldiers. This sectioning of land rote number 25 was called \\"Harneks\\". The soldiers started to farm the land; they acquired sheep's and goats. These fields were called \\"soldier field\\". Such a field was located near the current backup heating plant in √Ölidhem. The city of Ume√• was ravaged by a large-scale city fire, called Ume√• city fire, which laid most of the city in ashes. To rebuild the city, several industries were built by the river side below √Ölidbacken. During the years to come a brickwork factory, a turpentine and tar factory, and two steam sawmills, \\"√ñbackas√•gen\\" and \\"Ume√• √•ngs√•g\\", were built. In 1903 the construction of Ume√• hospital began. These establishments attracted factory workers, craftsmen and trades of all kind to settle down on √Ölidbacken. A variegated society with working shanties, cafes, shoemakers, shops and road carriers emerged. When I-20 was built and general conscription was instituted in 1901 the sectioning of land was phased out. \\"√ñns by\\" started to split up and sell their collective land to, among other workers at \\"√ñbackas√•gen\\". In the olden days and during the soldier time, the land at √Ölidbacken was owned by \\"√ñns by\\" and used it as a mountain grazing. Cows were transported from the island during the summer to graze. The women on the island rowed over every morning and night to milk the cows. In the 1950s the \\"total sanitation\\" of the area was initiated and the shanty town started to disappear. The area was built between the late 1960s till the middle of 1970. The recent largest changes took place in the beginning of the 90s, when √Ölidhemstunneln was built in 92, and the area got its new name: Tunnelbacken.  Detail plans  = Detail plan of 1950 = In 1948 the municipality adopted the new city plan for √Ölidbacken on 19 November; the proposal was due to the first of January in 1955. = Detail plan of 1991 = The 22 second of April 1991 the city council accepted the new detail plan for √Ölidbacken. The plan itself was written in the seventh of April 1989. It was revised in 1990 and 1991. The purpose of the new plan was to enhance the traffic situation on √Ölidbacken and to improve the environment for the inhabitants of the area by covering the highways. Furthermore, the covering would create a larger area for residential buildings. Changes after revision of the 1991 plan: The convenience store was moved from the ground floor of the new buildings to its own building in the east; this area was supposed to be a parking garage. The building that had the highest total height was 11 floors. After remarks from the Civil Aviation Authority, it was reduced to nine floors with a height limit of + 51,5 meters.

Biography Lasso was born in Madiun, East Java on 17 January 1973 to Bartholomeus B. Lasso and Sri Noerhida. His mother told him that he could become a famous singer, saying that \\"[his] life should be beautiful\\" because of his voice. While attending high school at SMA Negeri 2 Surabaya, he established Outsider Band along with the drummer Wawan Juniarso, from Dewa 19, and guitarist Piyu of Padi. After graduating from high school, he attended Airlangga University and earned a degree in economics. Lasso eventually became a member of Dewa 19 together with Wawan Juniarson, Andra Junaidi, Ahmad Dhani, and Erwin Prasetya. With Dewa 19, he released the album Kangen, which was chosen as the best album of the year by BASF in 1993. Beginning after Dewa 19's third album, Lasso used drugs heavily; his drug addiction led to his personal decision to resign from the band in 2001. In order to overcome his addiction, he tried going to rehab and alternative medicine; he was also hospitalized and put under isolation at home. All of these efforts were to no avail. After promising his dying mother that he would beat his addiction, he became more adamant in attempting to recover, eventually succeeding. He also quit his 20-year habit of smoking in 2010, after his son began taking and destroying his cigarettes. After his dismissal from Dewa 19, Lasso became a solo singer. He released his first solo album, the commercially successful Sendiri Dulu, that year which sold over 500.000 copies. Two years later, he released his most successful album Keseimbangan, which featured two songs performed with Dhani. This album sold more than 800.000 copies. In 2004 he released Kulihat Kudengar dan Kurasakan, of which two songs became used for the movie Mengejar Matahari (Chasing the Sun). In 2006, he released the album Selalu Ada, while the following year his album The Best of included a duet with Bunga Citra Lestari. In 2009 rumours spread that Lasso would become mute due to damage to his voice box; although he did not perform for four months during that period, he performed in a series of concerts between May and June of that year. Lasso has expressed interest in becoming a music producer if he can no longer be a singer. In 2012, Lasso released a compilation album, Yang Terbaik. The album was only sold at KFC outlets in Indonesia. The album compiled top hit singles and six new songs, \\"Kisah Kita\\", \\"Karena Aku Tlah Denganmu\\", \\"Cintailah Aku Sepenuh Hati\\", \\"Satu Cinta\\", \\"Doa Untuk Cinta\\" and \\"Cinta Adalah Misteri\\". Lasso also includes musicians who merged his albums sold in KFC stores like Cinta Laura, Indah Dewi Pertiwi, Agnes Monica, SM*SH, T.R.I.A.D, Rossa, Slank, Last Child, Ello, Sammy Simorangkir, Armada and Ungu. In 2016, Ari Lasso joined the judging panel of the season 2 of The Voice Indonesia. Personal life When not busy with music, Lasso tries to participate in his children's lives, assisting with their homework and attending school performances. Lasso has noted that Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven has influenced his parenting style and belief that a parent's interest in their children's lives can be a large influence.

The determination was significant for the Jardwadjali and Wergaia peoples as it was the first successful native title claim in south-eastern Australia and in Victoria. The Native Title claim was initially filed in 1995 and took 10 years for the legal process to come to determination. In his reasons for judgement Justice Merkel explained the significance of his orders: :The orders I propose to make are of special significance as they constitute the first recognition and protection of native title resulting in the ongoing enjoyment of native title in the State of Victoria and, it would appear, on the South-Eastern seaboard of Australia. These are areas in which the Aboriginal peoples suffered severe and extensive dispossession, degradation and devastation as a consequence of the establishment of British sovereignty over their lands and waters during the 19th century. Justice Merkel also listed the influence of senior Wotjobaluk elder William John Kennedy, who was also known as Uncle Jack Kennedy, in his reasons for judgment. Sadly Kennedy died on 6 September 2005 before the determination but Justice Merkel acknowledged \\"he had, in a practical sense, achieved ‚Äòwhat the elders expected of [him]‚Äô by, as was stated in his eulogy, ‚Äòfighting for this little piece of country for his ancestors and for future generations.‚Äô\\" In contrast to the Yorta Yorta v Victoria native title claim dismissed by Justice Olney in 1998,. that was also subjected to failed appeals to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia,. and the High Court in 2002 were also dismissed. and the High Court of Australia, Justice Merkel ruled: :the ‚Äòtide of history‚Äô has not ‚Äòwashed away‚Äô any real acknowledgement of traditional laws and any real observance of traditional customs by the applicants and has not, as a consequence, resulted in the foundation of their native title disappearing....Indeed, the evidence in, and the outcome of, the present case is a living example of the principle that is now recognised in native title jurisprudence that traditional laws and customs are not fixed and unchanging. Rather, they evolve over time in response to new or changing social and economic exigencies to which all societies adapt as their social and historical contexts change.

The walls were constructed between 1283 and 1287 after the foundation of Conwy by Edward I, and were designed to form an integrated system of defence alongside Conwy Castle. The walls are long and include 21 towers and three gatehouses. The project was completed using large quantities of labourers brought in from England; the cost of building the castle and walls together came to around ¬£15,000, a huge sum for the period. The walls were slightly damaged during the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr in 1401, but political changes in the 16th century reduced the need to maintain such defences around the town. The fortifications were treated sympathetically during the development of the road and railway systems in Conwy during the 19th century and survived largely intact into the modern period. Today the walls form part of the UNESCO world heritage site administered by Cadw. Historians Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham describe the defences as \\"one of the most impressive walled circuits\\" in Europe.Creighton and Higham, p.274. History =13th century= Before the English construction of the town of Conwy, the site was occupied by Aberconwy Abbey, a Cistercian monastery favoured by the Welsh princes.Ashbee, p.47. The site also controlled an important crossing point over the river Conwy between the coastal and inland areas of North Wales, and was defended for many years by Deganwy Castle. The English kings and Welsh princes had vied for control of the region since the 1070s and the conflict had been renewed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282.Ashbee,p.5; Taylor pp.6‚Äì7. Edward invaded with a huge army, pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. Edward captured Aberconwy in March 1283 and decided that the location would form the centre of a new county: the abbey would be relocated eight miles inland and a new English castle and walled town would be built on the monastery's former site.Ashbee, p.6. The ruined castle of Deganwy was abandoned and never rebuilt.Pounds, pp.172‚Äì3. Edward's plan was a colonial enterprise and placing the new town and walls on top of such a high-status native Welsh site was in part a symbolic act to demonstrate English power.Creighton and Higham, p.101. Reconstruction of the town walls shortly after their completion in the 13th century, seen from the east Traditionally Conwy's design and defences have been thought to have been inspired by the growth of the bastides. The bastides were new planned towns created in both France and English-held Gascony during the period, characterised by grids of straight streets, often defended by combinations of castles and town walls.Creighton and Higham, p.99. More recent research, however, has shown that English town design played a more significant role in shaping Conwy and other Edwardian town plans.Lilley, pp.109‚Äì111. Analysis of the new towns in Wales and England of the period has identified common similarities in their design, with most featuring a \\"T\\"-shaped street plan stretching away from the coast or river, aligned with a castle that is usually positioned at a top corner of the \\"T\\".Lilley, p.106. The street plan of Conwy forms a mirror image of Beaumaris, for example, although ditches and palisades protected Beaumaris rather than a stone wall.Lilley, p.108. The walls of Conwy were built at around the same time as the castle itself, under the overall supervision of Master James of Saint George, Edward's chief architect in North Wales.Ashbee, p.8. Each summer huge numbers of labourers were mobilised from across England, massed at Chester, and then brought into Wales for the building season.Brown, pp.123‚Äì5; Ashbee, pp.8‚Äì9. The first phase of work on the walls in 1283 involved digging ditches and erecting a palisade around the future town to secure the area in order to allow further work to commence.Creighton and Higham, p.102. The stone walls and towers were then constructed in three phases. Between 1284 and 1285, Richard the Engineer, Master James' second in command in North Wales, built the western side of the walls; this was the most vulnerable side of the town and was deliberately given priority.Ashbee, pp.8, 49‚Äì50; Turner, p.49. In 1286, John Francis, a Savoyard mason, finished the south wall and in 1287 the remainder of the walls along the eastern quayside were completed under the supervision of Philip of Darley.Ashbee, p.49-50; Turner, p.49. Edward's accountants did not separate the costs of the town walls from that of the castle, and the total cost of the two projects came to around ¬£15,000, a huge sum for the period.Ashbee, p.9. =14th ‚Äì 18th centuries= Western stretch of the walls, showing an area on the right cleared of housing after 1953 The new town of Conwy was populated by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, and the town walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants to settle there in safety.Longley, p.23; World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p.26. The town of Conwy was only modestly successful, however; by 1312 it had 124 burgage tenements ‚Äì properties paying rent to the king ‚Äì making it more successful than neighbouring Caernarfon, but less so than Beaumaris.Prestwich, pp.5‚Äì6. Welsh residents appear to have slowly arrived inside the town during the 14th century, and even then were subject to considerable suspicion.Ashbee, pp.52‚Äì3. Protecting the town remained a priority and during this period the constable charged with the security of the castle was also the mayor of Conwy, although protecting the town walls was probably the duty of the citizens rather than the forces attached to the castle.Creighton and Higham, p.101; World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p.27. The walls were guarded by crossbowmen, and improved firing positions for them were built into the town walls at the start of the 14th century.Ashbee, pp.50‚Äì1. In 1400 the Welsh prince Owain Glynd≈µr rose in rebellion against English rule.Ashbee, p.12. Two of Owain's cousins infiltrated and took control of Conwy Castle in 1401 and, despite the defensive walls, the town of Conwy was occupied for two months and sacked by Welsh forces.Ashbee, p.12; Hull, p.132. The townspeople complained that ¬£5,000 worth of damage had been done, including the destruction of the gates and the bridges along the town walls. Over a century later, there are records of the walls being repaired in the 1520s and 1530s by Henry VIII in preparation for a potential royal visit, but the ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne had heralded a change in the way Wales was administered.Ashbee, p.13; Taylor, p.16. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English.Taylor, p.16. The military importance of Conwy's defences declined and the townspeople used the walls' defensive ditches for discarding rubbish.Creighton and Higham, p.40; Ashbee, pp.13‚Äì4. Parts of the town walls were robbed for their stone during this period for use in the construction of local buildings.Lott, p.116. =19th ‚Äì 21st centuries= The Mill Gate gatehouse, showing a rectangular recess for a drawbridge Creighton and Higham, p.126. During the 19th century some changes to Conwy's town walls were made in order to accommodate a new railway line and roads. The engineer Thomas Telford built two new gateways into the walls in 1826 to accommodate the traffic from the new suspension bridge across the river Conwy.World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p.24. In 1848 Robert Stephenson constructed the Chester to Holyhead railway line, which ran through Conwy; unusually for the period, attempts were made to sensitively protect the appearance of the medieval fortifications and the entrance for the railway through the walls on the south side of the town was built in the form of a mock-Gothic archway, while an exit tunnel was dug under the western walls.Creighton and Higham, p.237; World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p.24. Interest in the town walls grew and in the 19th century one of the towers was restored and part of the wall-walk opened up for tourists.World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p.25. The walls were architecturally surveyed for the first time between 1928 and 1930, with the results published in 1938.Kenyon, p.151. The town walls were leased from Conwy's local authority by the Ministry of Works in 1953, and a concerted effort began to conserve and protect the fortifications.Kenyon, p.152. Many of the houses and buildings which had grown up against the walls since the 14th century were removed in an effort to improve the appearance of the walled circuit and to assist in conservation and archaeological work, and one of the 19th-century gateways inserted by Telford was demolished in 1958.World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p.24; Creighton and Higham, p.245. Arnold J. Taylor, a prominent historian of the Edwardian castles, conducted extensive academic work on the history and architecture of Conwy's walls during the 1950s and 1960s, adding to their prominence.Kenyon, p.152-3. Today Conwy's walls are managed by the Welsh heritage organisation Cadw as a tourist attraction; they form a popular walk around the town, although not all of the walls are safe for tourists to use.Creighton and Higham, p.247. The walls require ongoing maintenance; in the financial year between 2002 and 2003, for example, this cost ¬£145,000 (¬£184,000 in 2010 terms).World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 2 , Cadw, p.56; Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present , Measuring Worth, Lawrence H. Office, accessed 10 September 2011. The walls were declared part of a UNESCO world heritage site in 1986 and are classed as a grade 1 listed building and hold scheduled monument status. They are considered by historians Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham to be \\"one of the most impressive walled circuits\\" in Europe. Architecture Plan of the walls in 21st century The Conwy town walls today present a largely unbroken, long triangular circuit around the town, enclosing , and ‚Äì thanks in part to Conwy remaining a relatively small town ‚Äì are unusually well preserved.Creighton and Higham, p.223; Ashbee, pp.47, 55. They are mostly built from the same local sand- and limestone used at the castle, but with additional rhyolite stone used along the upper parts of the eastern walls.Lott, p.115. When first built, the historical record shows that the walls were \\"daubed\\" ‚Äì it is unclear precisely what this involved, but it implies the walls were not simply bare stone, and were possibly whitewashed.Creighton and Higham, p.136; Ashbee, p.50. The 21 surviving towers are mostly \\"gap-backed\\", lacking walls on the inside of the towers, and originally included removable wooden bridges to allow sections of the walls to be sealed off from attackers.Creighton and Higham, p.274; Ashbee, p.51. The tops of the walls feature an unusual design that uses a sequence of corbels to provide a flat, relatively wide wall-walk.Ashbee, p.48; Creighton and Higham, p.125. The east side of the walls emerge from Conwy Castle, but are gapped where the Chester to Holyhead road enters the town.Ashbee, p.56. The east side has four towers, with a postern gate and the Lower Gate both giving access to the town's quay; all of these features have been substantially altered from their original medieval appearances. The Lower Gate, equipped with twin towers and a portcullis, controlled access to both the quayside and, before the construction of the bridge, the ferry across the estuary. The wall here was originally only high in places, and was later raised to its current height using rhyolite stone in the early 14th century.Ashbee, p.57. The walls and Conwy Castle, seen from the north-west The west side of the walls include nine towers, rising upwards towards the south- west corner. Two of the towers were significantly affected by 19th-century developments; one was converted into an entrance way for the Bangor Road in 1827, whilst another suffered a deep fissure caused by subsidence from the excavation of the Chester to Holyhead railway tunnel in 1845, and had to be underpinned in 1963.Ashbee, p.58. One of the remaining merlons on this stretch of the walls' battlements has a stone finial on top, a design originally used along all of the town walls. The western wall originally extended out to the river Conwy itself, ending in a round tower, but this has since been lost; a similar spur arrangement was seen at Chester and Lincoln.Ashbee, p.57; Creighton and Higham, p.118. The walls stretch along the south of the town with eight towers and two gatehouses. The Upper Gate formed the main inland entrance to the town during the medieval period, and, in addition to its twin towers, was originally protected by a stone barbican, of which some stonework still remains ‚Äì a rare survival for town barbicans of this period.Ashbee, p.59; Creighton and Higham, p.144. A gatekeeper would have lived over the entrance during the medieval period.Ashbee, p.60. The original defensive ditch and drawbridge have been filled in, however, and replaced by a modern road.Ashbee, p.59. The second gatehouse, Mill Gate, was designed to allow access to the royal watermill that lay just outside the main town, and similarly features twin protective towers.Ashbee, pp.62‚Äì3. In between the two gatehouses are the remains of Llywelyn's Hall, a grand building originally built into the town walls by Edward I before being dismantled and moved to Caernarfon Castle in 1316.Ashbee, p.61. Further along the walls is the mock- Gothic archway built in 1846 to accommodate the local railway, possibly drawing on similar designs used in Chester.Ashbee, p.62; Creighton and Higham, p.237. A unique set of twelve medieval latrines is built into the southern town walls, first constructed for the use of royal staff working in adjacent buildings in the 13th century.Ashbee, p.62; Creighton and Higham, p.147.

In the provincial assembly, Davidson aligned himself with the Socialist members Parker Williams and James Hurst Hawthornthwaite. Because Premier Richard McBride only held a slim majority in the assembly, he often required support from the Socialists, which meant that they were able to push for progressive legislation, such as the eight-hour work day for miners, in the province.

Life  Elizabeth Marie was the only child of Duke Charles Frederick I of M√ºnsterberg-Oels (1593‚Äì1647) from his first marriage with Anna Sophia (1598‚Äì1641), daughter of Duke Frederick William I of Saxe-Weimar. On 1 May 1647 Mary Elizabeth married at Oels Duke Silvius Nimrod of W√ºrttemberg-Juliusburg. Her father died later that month, on the 31st. He had been the last male member of the House of Podƒõbrady and he had hoped he could pass the duchy to his daughter. Already in 1638, he had declared Oels to be a \\"women fief\\". Emperor Ferdinand III, however, raised objections. In 1648, a compromise was reached: the Moravian dominion of Jevi≈°ovice was ceded to the emperor and the emperor invested Sylvius Nimrod with the Duchies of Oels and Bernstadt. The Podƒõbrady family retained the Moravian dominion of ≈†ternberk; the Duchy of M√ºnsterberg was declared vacant and fell back to the Emperor. The Emperor combined the coats of arms of Elizabeth Marie and Silvius Nimrod. In 1652, Elizabeth Marie and Silvius Nimrod founded the Ducal W√ºrttemberg-Oelsian Order of the Skull. After Silvius Nimrod died in 1664, Elizabeth Marie and Dukes Christian of Brieg and August of Legnica acted jointly as regent for her four minor sons.

It was first published in 1839. Plot summary In an isolated town called Vondervotteimittiss (wonder-what-time-it-is), the punctilious inhabitants seem to be concerned with nothing but clocks and cabbage. This methodical, boring and quiet little borough is devastated by the arrival of a devilish figure playing a big fiddle who comes straight down from a hill, goes into the belltower, brutally attacks the belfry-man and rings thirteen o'clock, to the horror of the town's inhabitants. Analysis The devil character can be seen as the bringer of chaos to an ordered system. In the context of the story, the devil is a troublemaker who destroys the serenity of tradition. However, in that Poe mocks the town's ridiculous traditions, it can be interpreted that the devil is a violent force of change, originality and creativity in an otherwise stagnant environment. Some have claimed the story to be political satire making fun of the United States President Martin Van Buren, who was of Dutch descent like the inhabitants of Vondervotteimittis. However, aside from Dutch caricatures used for humor, the story does not seem to mock any particular target. In A Companion to Poe Studies it is noted, \\"Poe introduced numerous details to make contemporaries think of the president. But the story is not therefore a political satire, for Poe said such stories hit out in all directions ... Moreover, Poe's literary play, his pleasure at creating connections, seems more important than is any single 'target' of satire.\\"Carlson, Eric W. A Companion to Poe Studies. Greenwood Press, 1996. p. 133 Critics often compare the tale to another New York satire, A History of New-York, written by Washington Irving under the pseudonym \\"Diedrich Knickerbocker\\". Illustrations There are many famous illustrations for this short tale, including one is by the Italian engraver Alberto Martini, which is very accurate in describing the final moment, and another by the Belgian artist James Ensor, which illustrates the moment when the stranger arrives in town. Publication history The story was first published in the May 18, 1839, issue of Philadelphia's Saturday Chronicle and Mirror of the Times. Adaptations Between 1902 and 1911 or 1912, French composer Claude Debussy worked on a one-act opera based on \\"The Devil in the Belfry\\", Le diable dans le beffroi. This short opera was to be presented with La chute de la maison Usher, another one-act opera based on Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher. For his adaptation of \\"The Devil in the Belfry\\", Debussy said he wanted to create \\"a happy blending of the real and the fantastic\\". His version of the devil, he said, would \\"put an end to the idea that the devil is the spirit of evil. He is simply the spirit of contradiction.\\" The character of the devil was not intended to speak or sing, only whistle.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. Checkmark Books, 2001. p. 68 The story was also the subject of an opera by Italian composer Adriano Lualdi, premiered in 1925. Influence on popular culture * The title of the rock group Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's 2010 album Beat the Devil's Tattoo was derived from a line in \\"The Devil in the Belfry\\".http://www.kyeo.tv/2010/04/27/caught-on-film-black-rebel- motorcycle-club-exclusive-interview/ * The 2011 Francis Ford Coppola film, Twixt (film), depicts a town with a seven-faced clock tower and claims that Poe wrote his short story as a result of his overnight stay in the town.

The men were not members of any loyalist paramilitary organisation. It later emerged in court hearings that Robb had made disparaging remarks about the killing of UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade leader Richard Jameson by an LVF gunman the previous month.\\"UVF boss quip led to killings\\". BBC News. 25 November 2008.

On 3 April 2009, Brown was sentenced to 35 years imprisonment for each count of murder. Dillon committed suicide in January 2005, and Burcombe, originally charged with the killings, turned 'Queen's evidence' by testifying against Brown and therefore received a reduced sentence.

The leader of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade, Richard Jameson, had been jostled and insulted by members of the LVF who had been holding a celebration at the club to commemorate the second anniversary of the shooting death of their former leader, Billy Wright. Wright had founded the LVF in 1996 after he and the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster Brigade had been stood down by the UVF's Brigade Staff following an unauthorised sectarian killing carried out by his men during the Drumcree standoff. In December 1997 Wright was shot dead inside the Maze Prison by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). Shortly after Jameson left the club, he returned with a number of UVF men armed with baseball bats and pickaxe handles. A violent altercation broke out in which 12 people were seriously injured including three LVF prisoners out on Christmas parole. The LVF decided to retaliate and sent a gunman to assassinate Jameson in the driveway outside his home on 10 January 2000.UVF Prepares Night of the Long Knives; Terrorist Group Plans Executions After Funeral of UVF Brigadier But 'No Claim No Blame' Means PUP Will Be Able to Stay in Assembly\\".

The club was then being managed by Willie Frazer,\\"In Portadown, vengeance is theirs\\". Sunday Tribune. Susan McKay. 28 March 2010 well known as a loyalist victims' advocate and political activist, who has since suggested that the killings were linked to a threat posed to him by the UVF. FAIR publication concerning alleged threats to Willie Frazer; pp24, 30 and 46 refer to the Tandragee killings Billy Wright had reportedly frequented the nightclub before his imprisonment and death. The group of three men and two women had attempted to enter a taxi, but regulations had stipulated that not more than four passengers could travel together, so Robb and McIlwaine got out of the vehicle and went off in search of a house party. The pair knocked on the door of a house in Sinton Park belonging to Mid-Ulster UVF member Stephen Leslie Brown (19, also known as \\"Stephen Leslie Revels\\") and were invited inside where other UVF members Noel Dillon (older brother of Brown's girlfriend) and Mark Burcombe (19) were also present. Alcoholic beverages were consumed at the party. The atmosphere inside the house suddenly turned ugly when Dillon asked the teenagers what they felt about the LVF killing of UVF Mid-Ulster brigadier Richard Jameson, who had been a successful businessman and was extremely popular in the Portadown area. McIlwaine remained silent, however Robb had replied \\"so fucking what, it's got fuck all to do with me\\" which Dillon had taken exception to. When he informed Robb that Jameson had been his good friend, Robb had made further disparaging comments which also angered Brown. Brown, out of earshot of the teenagers, had decided to assault Robb in retaliation, saying he would \\"punch the head off Andrew\\". Neither Robb nor McIlwaine had been a member of any loyalist paramilitary organisation, although Robb had tenuous links to the LVF having been an associate of Billy Wright, and even photographed in 1996 at a march led by Wright.Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of loyalty: a history of the UDA. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. p.243 Writers Henry McDonald and Ian S. Wood alleged that, unknown to the teenagers, a UVF unit had gone to \\"The Spot\\" to seek out two known LVF individuals rumoured to have been involved in Jameson's killing; however, they had already left the nightclub by the time the UVF arrived. The UVF men encountered Robb and McIlwaine instead, and targeted them as LVF members implicated in Jameson's death. =Attacks= Under the pretence of another party elsewhere, Brown lured Robb and McIlwaine to get into his car along with Dillon and Burcombe. Brown drove off towards Druminure Road where he stopped the car at a gate leading to a field and ordered the passengers to get out. Burcombe led McIlwaine away from the vehicle; as they were walking downhill, Burcombe informed McIlwaine that the other two men were going to \\"give Andrew Robb a beating for slabbering [talking in an offensive manner] about Richard Jameson.

He also sustained wounds and gashes to his face and head.\\"Portadown Feud\\". RT√â News. March 2000. Interview with Anne Robb The two perpetrators returned, both \\"walking with a swagger\\" to where McIlwaine waited downhill from the parked car with Burcombe. McIlwaine at that moment made an attempt to run away but Brown, Dillon, and Burcombe caught up with him as he fell to the ground. Brown gave him a severe kicking, mostly in the head. Dillon produced a butcher's knife and cut McIlwaine's throat while Brown shouted encouragement and Burcombe overlooked the scene from about five feet away. Brown and Dillon left McIlwaine still breathing on the ground; once they were back inside the car, Brown proposed to drive the car over his head, but Dillon dissuaded him. Brown halted the vehicle, took the knife and walked back over to where McIlwaine was lying on the road making a \\"wheezing\\" sound. Brown stabbed McIlwaine repeatedly in the face and chest. When he noticed that McIlwaine appeared to be looking up at him, Brown stabbed him deeply in his left eye; the wound penetrated his brain, killing him. According to Burcombe's later testimony, Brown appeared \\"crazed\\" as he handed the knife back to Dillon and said he was \\"buzzing\\"; he subsequently went on to recount stabbing McIlwaine in the eye. He threatened to cut Burcombe's throat or kill a member of his family if he told anyone what happened. Aftermath Several hours later at 9.30 a.m., the mutilated bodies of Robb and McIlwaine were discovered lying in pools of blood on the roadside 100 metres apart from one another by a woman taking her children to dancing lessons. Because of the devastating stab wounds inflicted upon the teenagers, the RUC had assumed that McIlwaine had received a shotgun blast to his face.\\"Teens' brutal murder are sad story with a twist\\". Irish Times. John Dee. 23 February 2003 Retrieved 12 September 2011 Both of their throats were slashed so deeply that the teenagers were nearly decapitated. The RUC immediately set up an inquiry into the killings. Post mortems revealed that Robb had sustained a severe cut throat injury to the neck and a penetrating wound to the abdomen with three penetrating wounds. There were no defence injuries. McIlwaine received a severe cut throat injury, seven penetrating wounds to the chest and penetrating wounds to the face and to the left eye. Both teenagers were intoxicated at the time of their deaths.In Her Majesty's Court of Appeals in Northern Ireland, The Queen v Stephen Leslie Brown (also known as Stephen Leslie Revels).

Henry McDonald. 27 February 2000 The LVF leadership, however maintained that the blame for the killings \\"lies at the door of the Eagle\\"; a reference to the Brigade Staff headquarters on the Shankill Road. It then threatened to strike back against carefully selected targets in the Belfast UVF.\\"Feud warning from loyalist terror group\\". The Guardian. Henry McDonald. 5 March 2000 Retrieved 11 November 2011 A year after the killings, Robb's 16-year-old sister Jenna was beaten up by a group of boys belonging to the Young Citizens Volunteers (YCV), the UVF's youth wing, who had followed her as she walked along a Portadown street. As they beat her with hockey sticks, they repeatedly called her an \\"LVF bastard\\". She was left with bruises to her head, arms, and back. She was so traumatised by the attack that she was afraid to return to school. =Arrests and allegations= The day after the homicides, a number of people were arrested in connection to the crime, including Noel Dillon. The arrests were not made under anti-terrorist legislation and the suspects were all released unconditionally the same evening. On 27 February 2000, Stephen Brown was brought before the Armagh magistrate's court after he was charged with both murders. The police told the court they had plenty of forensic evidence connecting him to the homicides. Ten months later, Brown was released on bail after the court was told the prosecution had expressed doubts about their principal witness and the forensic evidence was not sufficient to secure a conviction. On 6 February 2001, the charges against Brown were unexpectedly dropped by the Director of Public Prosecutions. In April 2001, Mark Burcombe was arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Acts in relation to his UVF activities, but was released without charge. David McIlwaine's father, Paul, campaigned for nine years to obtain justice for his son. He enlisted the aid of a nationalist human rights group and set up his own online support group, \\"Justice for David McIlwaine\\". He alleged that the police were protecting the identity of a local Tandragee UVF commander (now deceased), who was reportedly present at the scene of the crime and was working as an agent for RUC Special Branch. He had been a close friend of Richard Jameson and had allegedly vowed to seek revenge against the LVF for his assassination. In 2005, the UVF Brigade Staff had conducted an internal investigation into the attacks.\\"UVF held internal probe in Belfast after murders, court told\\". Belfast Telegraph.

Retrieved 12 September 2011 On 2 November 2005, the Tandragee double killing was reconstructed and featured on the BBC One programme Crimewatch in which a ¬£10,000 award was offered. After viewing the programme, Mark Burcombe consulted a clergyman and solicitor, and subsequently presented himself to police outside Hillsborough Castle to give them information regarding the events which took place on 19 February 2000. He was interviewed about the killings over a period of four days and admitted to having known both Robb and McIlwaine. He was arrested and charged with the murders along with Stephen Brown, who had also been arrested on 7 November 2005 in connection with the double killing. When Detective Chief Inspector Tim Hanley charged Brown with the murders, the latter pleaded not guilty to each charge. Noel Dillon had committed suicide in January of that same year. In January 2008, shortly before his trial was due to start, Burcombe decided to turn \\"Queen's evidence\\". He formally agreed to admit to and give a full account of his own role in the murders and to give evidence against Stephen Brown. He signed an Agreement under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 to receive a reduced sentence in return for giving evidence against his co-defendant. Specially trained Detectives from the PSNI Crime Operations Department conducted a full Debrief of Burcombe concerning his own criminality and the criminality of others involved. =Convictions= Sinn F√©in president Gerry Adams, in a letter to the Attorney General for Northern Ireland, described the Tandragee killings as \\"a barbaric act\\" Burcombe pleaded guilty to the offence of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm to Andrew Robb and was sentenced to 28 months imprisonment with two months consecutive for an unrelated suspended sentence. The Robb and McIlwaine families were outraged and disappointed at the leniency shown to Burcombe. Sinn F√©in president Gerry Adams asked Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal, the Attorney General for Northern Ireland to review the case and consider an appeal to impose a heavier sentence,Top law officer backs plea bargain deal for convicted supergrass\\". Belfast Telegraph. 4 August 2008 writing that \\"all records before the courts on this crime verify it was a barbaric act\\". Adams also went on to affirm that he shared the McIlwaine family's belief that a state agent was involved in the homicides and was being protected. Lady Scotland, however, backed the plea bargain deal.\\"Adams demands a review in Tandragee murder-case\\". Portadown Times. 16 July 2008. Retrieved 13 September 2011. Stephen Brown was found guilty of the murders on 3 March 2009. The trial which had commenced on 25 November 2008 was held at the Belfast Crown Court without a jury. The prosecution had relied upon three pieces of evidence to prove Brown's culpability. These were the testimony of Mark Burcombe, who had witnessed McIlwaine's killing and had been present at Robb's killing; the forensic material found by the RUC at the crime scene (including DNA samples found on McIlwaine's jacket which matched Brown's); the hearsay evidence of Brown's former girlfriend who claimed he had admitted to her that he had killed McIlwaine. Burcombe declared that McIlwaine was murdered because he had witnessed Robb's killing. One month later, 3 April, Brown was sentenced to 35 years imprisonment for each count of murder. The trial judge, who had passed sentence on Brown, declared that the murders were \\"among the most gruesome of the past 40 years\\". He went on to add, \\"they represent unbridled mindless violence and a total disregard for the value and dignity of human life\\": Brown made an unsuccessful appeal to have his murder conviction overturned on 24 May 2011.

Content Even though the Anthology of Planudes is based in the Anthology of Cephalas, comparison with the Palatine Anthology (also based on Cephalas's anthology) shows that not only many poems and epigrams were omitted (Palatine has 3700 epigrams, while the Planudean only 2400), but also Planudes made several mistakes or \\"corrections\\". At the beginning the transcription was done accurately, but after a certain point omissions become more and more as if the author lost his interest or was pressed to finalise the books. As a result, when the much more accurate Palatine Anthology was discovered, the interest of researchers was shifted from the Planudean to the Palatine. The only important element of the Planudean collection are the 388 epigrams not found in the Palatine, which are considered to have been part of the Anthology of Cephalas, but for an unknown reasons were not transcribed in the Palatine Anthology.

It is considered a speciality of Austria, Bavaria, and Franconia. The dish is commonly served in beer garden and on folk festivals and has nothing to do with the dried Stockfish. Traditionally it is prepared from local fish like coregonus or whitefish like common bream but nowadays trout, fingerling or mackerel are also used. Steckerlfish as it is served Steckerlfisch is a very popular meal at the Munich Oktoberfest. It was the Oktoberfest which made the dish popular. A local fish merchant introduced Steckerlfisch to the fair in the early part of the 20th century. Preparation The whole gutted fish are marinated in a hearty mixture of oil, spices and garlic and skewered on sticks of about 60 cm length. The sticks are then fixed in a way that the fish are positioned upside-down and angular next to the embers.

The United Kingdom Official Number 131411 and Code Letters HVDQ were allocated. Her port of registry was Liverpool, Lancashire. She was built to serve on the United Kingdom ‚Äì Australia route. She was completed in February 1912, leaving Liverpool on her maiden voyage on 4 February, bound for Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In November 1914, Talthybius was engaged in transporting 1,000 Chinese from the United States to Hong Kong to spend Christmas there with their families. On arrival at Kobe, Japan on 23 July 1925, 62 Chinese crew deserted the ship. At 03:00 (local time) on 23 August 1925, Talthybius was in collision with the Chinese fishing junk 1605 off Waglan Island, Hong Kong. 1605 was sunk; a Court of Inquiry found that she was not showing any lights and Talthybius was cleared of any blame for the collision. From 1934, Talthybius was recorded as holding a passenger certificate. She was then assessed as , . With the changes to Code Letters in 1934, Talthybius was allocated the letters GPZN. For a couple of years in the 1930s, Talthybius was used as an accommodation ship at Birkenhead, Cheshire. On 11 April 1939, Talthybius suffered an explosion in one of her coal bunkers which blew off two hatches and injured four firemen. She anchored in the Royal Roads off San Francisco, California, United States, for inspection. She was allowed to continue her voyage from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to Hong Kong. In 1939, and again in 1940, Talthybius carried gold bullion worth ¬£1,000,000 from Hong Kong to Canada. Talthybius was a member of Convoy HX 102, which departed from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada on 11 January 1941 and arrived at Liverpool on 29 January. She was carrying general and special cargo. She was a member of Convoy OB 297, which departed from Liverpool on 12 March and dispersed at sea on 17 March. Talthybius was bound for Halifax and Saint John, New Brunswick with general cargo. She was due to return with Convoy HX 119, but did not join that convoy. Talthybius joined Convoy HX 120, which departed from Halifax on 10 April and arrived at Liverpool on 29 April. She was carrying general cargo and of TNT. On 4 May, Talthybius was damaged in an air raid on Liverpool. She suffered further damage in another raid four days later. Talthybius was a member of Convoy OB 330, which departed from Liverpool on 2 June and dispersed at sea on 7 June. She was bound for Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She returned with Convoy HX 136, which departed from Halifax on 30 June and arrived at Liverpool on 18 July. Talthybius was carrying general cargo and shells. She also carried the Convoy Commodore, who described the ship as \\"efficient and well manned\\" with \\"a good fighting spirit\\". She was only able to fly a kite when the wind was from the starboard due to only having one fitting for kites. The commodore recommended that she be equipped to fly kites from both sampson posts. Talthybius was a member of Convoy ON 3, which departed from Liverpool on 31 July and dispersed at sea on 14 August. She was carrying a number of passengers bound for Montreal. She returned with Convoy HX 148, which departed from Halifax on 4 September and arrived at Liverpool on 17 September. Talthybius was carrying general cargo. Talthybius then sailed to Holyhead, Anglesey, from where she departed on 30 September to join Convoy BB 82, which had departed from the Belfast Lough on that day and arrived at Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire on 1 October. She then sailed on to Cardiff, Glamorgan, arriving the next day. She returned to Milford Haven, from where she departed on 12 October to join Convoy OS 9, which sailed from Liverpool on 13 October and arrived at Freetown, Sierra Leone on 1 November. Talthybius was carrying general cargo bound for Alexandria, Egypt. She was armed with a 4-inch or 4.7-inch gun, a Bofors gun, four machine guns and a kite. Talthybius was a member of Convoy BM 10, which departed from Bombay, India on 8 January 1942 and arrived at Singapore on 25 January. She was carrying a cargo described as \\"stores\\", which included lorries and tanks. On 3 February 1942, two direct hits were scored on Talthybius during a Japanese air raid on Singapore and she was set on fire. She was declared to be unseaworthy and abandoned, sinking in the Empire Dock, to where she had been moved following the raid. The officers and European crew from Talthybius formed part of the crew of , which took 600 refugees form Singapore to Java, Indonesia and then towed from Tanjung Priok, Indonesia to Fremantle, Australia. The Chinese crewmembers decided to take their chances in Singapore. Talthybius was salvaged by the Japanese, repaired and returned to service as Taruyasu Maru, operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The fate of Taruyasu Maru is unclear, as conflicting accounts state that either she struck a mine off Sado Island, Japan (}) and sank 30 June 1945, or she was sunk by United States Navy aircraft from Task Force 38 in Maizuru Bay, Japan on 30 July 1945. She was salvaged by the British and repaired. Passed to the MoWT, she was renamed Empire Evenlode. She was again placed under the management of A Holt & Co Ltd. On 1 December 1945, she started the voyage back to the United Kingdom. This took until 8 May 1946 to complete due to the poor condition of the ship. Empire Evenlode served until 1949, when she was scrapped at Briton Ferry, Glamorgan.

The model, developed by J. Scott Armstrong and Andreas Graefe and first published in the Journal of Business Research,Armstrong, J. S., Graefe, A. (2011), Predicting elections from biographical information about candidates: A test of the index method, Journal of Business Research, 66 (7), 699-706 uses 59 biographical cues that are expected to affect the chances of a candidate on being elected.  Background  There is a large stream of research in the field of psychology that analyzes questions such as \\"what makes people emerge as leaders?\\"Antonakis John (2011), Predictors of leadership: The usual suspects and the suspect traits. In A. Bryman, D. Collinson, K. Grint, B. Jackson, M. Uhl-Bien (Eds.), Sage Handbook of Leadership, Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2011, pp. 269-285. For example, meta-analyses found intelligence and height to benefit both leader performance and leader emergence. Such findings from prior research were used to identify and code the majority of variables in the bio-index. In addition, for some variables, the authors used common sense. For example, it was assumed that a candidates are more attractive to voters if they are married but not divorced. In general, the model distinguishes two types of variables: # Yes / No variables (n=48): For this type of variable, candidates are assigned a score of 1 if they possess a certain attribute and 0 otherwise. For example, a candidate receives positive scores if he descends from a political family, is first-born, single child, lost a parent in childhood, is married but not divorced, has children, graduated from a prestigious college, held political offices, has authored a book, or has military experience. # Comparative variables (n=11): For this type of variable, the candidates of the two major parties are compared on the underlying attribute. The candidate who scores better than his opponent is assigned a score of 1 and 0 otherwise. For example, candidates who are taller, heavier, better-looking, more intelligent or have the more common name than their opponent receive a positive score while their opponent received a score of 0 for these variables. After all variables have been coded, the total index scores for each candidate are calculated. Then, the candidate who achieves the higher overall score is predicted as the election winner.  Decision-making implications  In using biographical information about candidates for generating the forecast, the model can be useful to political decision-makers. The bio-index model advises the challenging party (i.e., the Republicans) to nominate the candidate with the highest index score relative to the index score of the incumbent president (i.e., Obama). In particular, the model can advise decisions such as whether a candidate should run for office or which candidate a party should nominate.  Past performance  Armstrong and Graefe tested their model for the 29 U.S. Presidential Elections from 1896 to 2008. The model failed only two times. For the remaining 27 elections, the model correctly predicted the winner. The model wrongly predicted Ford to beat Carter in 1976 as well as Bush to defeat Clinton in 1992. This record of 93% correct predictions compared favorably to other statistical models as well as to polls and prediction markets.  2012 forecasts  With the bio-index, forecasts of the election outcome can be made as soon as the candidates are known; they can be issued even before, conditionally, on who is expected to be in the race. Thus, the model was used to help the Republican Party to decide whom they should nominate to run against President Obama in 2012. Forecasts of the chances of major Republican candidates to defeat Obama in 2012 were published in a research paperGraefe, A., Armstrong, J. S.

Opening The original plan for the line was to meet the proposed Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway at Ambergate to provide a route from Manchester to the East Coast. The Midland Railway bought shares in the line as it saw an opportunity to run through trains to London. The Manchester and Birmingham Railway, which would provide access from Stockport to Manchester over its own line, supported the project for the same reason. However, in 1846 it merged into the new London and North Western Railway which was opposed to any competition into London. The station, nonetheless, had a busy trade with some sixty or seventy thousand visitors to Chatsworth House each year.Williams, F.S., (1874) The Midland Railway: Its Rise and Progress Derby: Bemrose and Son The stalemate lasted until 1862 when the Midland realigned the track and moved to a new station as it extended the line into Buxton. The original station building, which had been designed by Joseph Paxton, was used as a goods office until closure in 1967. It still exists within a shopping centre. The new station was particularly grand, with large first- and third-class facilities and, unusually, in 1891, a subway between the platforms to cater for dignitaries visiting the Duke of Devonshire. The through line Finally in 1867 the line reached Manchester and became part of one of the Midland's most prized assets. Besides the London expresses, some of which called at the station, there was substantial goods traffic. This included limestone southwards from the Peak District and, in particular, coal northward from the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Coalfield. Northwards from Rowsley, the line climbed over 600 feet in fourteen miles to its summit at Peak Forest with punishing gradients. A large Motive Power Depot and marshalling yard was opened in 1877 to provide banking engines and to split trains as necessary. This was not so much due to the lack of powerful engines, but because of the need to limit the strain on wagon couplings. Thus, in theory, a class 8F locomotive could haul 37 wagons, but a banker would still have to be provided.Bentley, C., (1997) British Railways Operating History: Volume One, The Peak District, Carnarvon: XPress Publishing. Moreover, account had to be taken of the braking capacity on the downhill stretch towards Chinley, such that larger engines were no more capable than the ubiquitous \\"4Fs\\". The Midland Railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. Dairy In June 1933 Express Dairies were granted a 99-year lease on approximately of railway land, on which to build a creamery. The company were also granted dedicated use of one of the five newly created sidings. Express built a facility that included a milk cooling depot, spray, pond condenser and filter plant. Milk Tank Wagons were normally attached to the 5.18pm local to Derby for Cricklewood, or the 10.15pm express freight to Brent sidings. In the 12 months to the end of May 1934, the LMS noted that the carriage value of milk forwarded from Rowsley was ¬£16,886.  Closure  The station closed in 1967, the line closing the following year, and subsequently the track was removed. The line has since been reopened in stages from Matlock by Peak Rail as a heritage railway, reaching its current present terminus at a new station at Rowsley South (which opened in 1997). = Restoration plans = There are plans to reconstruct the line from the current terminus at Rowsley South through Rowsley station itself to as close to Bakewell as possible (this may include rebuilding and full restoration of the Rowsley station site itself as Phase 1 of the project). Peak Rail have secured a 99-year lease on the \\"currently disused\\" trackbed up to the A6 road at the site of the former station site \\"opposite the village of the same name\\". When Peak Rail has extended its services into the station site at Rowsley itself, the current terminus at Rowsley South will close as it is only half a mile away.

During the 24 years of Indonesian occupation (from 1975,) and after the 1999 independence referendum, pro Indonesian militias committed many human rights violations.Amnesty International, , ‚ÄúTimor-Leste; Justice Delayed, Justice Denied‚Äù, 2 August 2011. The country gained independence in 2002, and free and fair elections were held in 2007. The United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor (UNMIT) and the International Stabilization Force remain in the country while it develops its own security forces, the National Police (PNTL) and Defence Forces (F-FDTL). There are a number of issues concerning civil and political rights including breaches of the right to a fair trial and freedom from arbitrary arrest. The delivery of economic, social and cultural rights is also a concern, such as the right to education, and the right to family life; there is little respect for the rights of women and children and domestic violence and sexual abuse are major problems. International treaties East Timor joined the United Nations (UN) in 2002 and is a party to seven of the nine core human rights treaties: the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT)) and International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW)). It has not ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CED) or the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)). Its first Universal Periodic Review was held in October 2011.United Nations Development Programme Timor-Leste, , ‚ÄúTimor-Leste Prepares First Human Rights Assessment for UPR‚Äù, 10 February 2011. East Timor has ratified optional protocols of international treaties, including the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Constitutional protections The constitution enacted in 2002 is comprehensive, however more systems need to be put in place before the rights detailed in the constitution can be said to be guaranteed, for example the right to private property, health, and education is still not realised for many, and there is inefficient delivery of the right to a hearing and defence, free consent to marriage, and freedom to assemble,Government of Timor-Leste, , ‚ÄúConstitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste‚Äù. as detailed below. Failures of justice The country's inefficient legal system has raised human rights concerns. In 2010, the country was reported to have issues with lack of fair trials, the use of excessive force by police, and a pervading sense of impunity for past human rights breaches.Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; U.S. Department of State, , ‚Äú2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practice; Timor-Leste‚Äù, 8 April 2011. The judicial system suffers from a lack of staffing and resources, thus even though the law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, incarceration may occur because judges are unavailable, and there are long delays until people are heard at trial. There are also significant comprehension difficulties as although Tetum and Portuguese are both official languages of East Timor, Portuguese is the main legal language, which most of the population does not speak. There have also been reports of the police and defence force breaching the rights of civilians through cruel or degrading treatment such as beatings, excessive use of force, intimidation and threats made at gunpoint. Allegations of prison guards mistreating prisoners have also been made. Fighting between the police and defence force led to violent riots in 2006 resulting in civilian displacement and deaths.UN News Centre, , ‚ÄúTimor-Leste has made strides in bolstering human rights, UN report finds‚Äù, 5 October 2010. Additionally, in 2008 the commander of the Military Police, Alfredo Reinado, led an armed attack on the Prime Minister and President, leading to a state of emergency being declared and necessitating the creation of a Joint Command in order to stem the violence and human rights violations.Human Rights Watch, , ‚ÄúTimor-Leste; Events of 2008‚Äù. However, significantly, the President commuted the sentences of those responsible for the 2006 riots, and pardons were given to those involved with the 2008 violence, creating a perception of impunity, and the subsequent vetting process has not resulted in any dismissals for past human rights violations. Training programmes have resulted in some improvements, although allegations of human rights violations by the police and military continue to be made. Furthermore, reconciliation with Indonesia has been pursued rather than focusing on criminal prosecutions for crimes committed during the 1975-1999 occupation.Amnesty International, , ‚ÄúTimor-Leste President would support international tribunal‚Äù, 8 March 2010. The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor (Comiss√£o de Acolhimento, Verdade e Reconcilia√ß√£o), and the Commission of Truth and Friendship merely brought the truth to the fore rather than seeking prosecution for crimes including unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, sexual violence, torture, and war crimes. However Jos√© Ramos-Horta has accused \\"the UN of \\"hypocrisy\\" for using his government's stance on justice as a pretext for not setting up the tribunal. The Serious Crimes Investigation Team continues to investigate violations committed in 1999. Freedom of expression In East Timor freedom of speech and freedom of the press are protected by law, and this is generally respected by the government. There is also an active independent media operating mainly through television and radio, although there is limited access to televisions and radios, and reception problems limit broadcasting outside of Dili and the district capitals. Freedom of assembly East Timor law requires that four days' notice be given to the police before any demonstrations or strikes, and demonstrations are barred within 100 yards of government buildings or diplomatic facilities. However, in practice demonstrations are allowed without the advanced notifications, and the 100 yard regulation is rarely enforced. Political participation =Constitutional context= Rights to political participation are stated in article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantees rights to take part in public affairs, free and universal suffrage, and generally equal access to public service roles.International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (opened for signature 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976), art 25. These rights are largely upheld in Timor- Leste. Section 46 of the Constitution of Timor-Leste states that \\"every citizen has the right to participate in the political life and in the public affairs of the country\\"; that every \\"citizen has the right to establish and to participate in political parties\\"; and that \\"the establishment and organisation of such parties shall be regulated by law.\\"Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste 2002, s 46. Section 47 guarantees that every citizen above the age of seventeen has the right to vote and be elected.Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste 2002, s 47. and section 48 guarantees the right of citizens to submit \\"petitions, complaints and claims\\" to authorities.Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor- Leste 2002, s 48. The 2017 election was contested by 21 parties. Voter turnout was high, with 77 percent of Timorese votingKhoo Ying Hooi \\"After Timore- Leste's election, a Young Democracy Looks Forward\\" The Diplomat (25 July 2017) . compared to 74 percent in 2012, and 80 percent in 2007.U.S. Department of State \\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016\\" at 11. Elections are held under a party-list proportional representation system, in which voters select parties rather than individual candidates, a system that gives substantial power to party leaders. The electoral threshold is 4%, meaning that political parties need at least 4 percent of the vote to enter parliament. This limits the power of some minor parties.Michael Leach \\"In Timor-Leste, more power-sharing likely but election hard to pick\\" Asia Pacific Report . The system is supportive of female participation and there is a requirement for one third of a party's candidates to be women, resulting in Timor-Leste having one of the highest percentages of female MPs in the Asia Pacific region (38 percent prior to the 2017 election). However, meaningful participation by women is sometimes constrained by traditional attitudes and stereotypes, particularly in local and regional roles. There are no legal constraints on participation by the country's few ethnic minority groups and they appear to be well integrated into the political system, although the total number positions held by ethnic minorities is uncertain since self- identification of ethnicity is an uncommon practice. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index rates East Timor consistently between 7.22-7.24 between 2008 and 2016, on a scale where 0 indicates a fully authoritarian regime and 10 indicates a perfect democracy. This rating is the highest in the South Pacific and is close to that of major democracies such as the United States (7.98) and France (7.92).The Economist \\"The Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index\\" . =Limitations= Limitations on political participation in Timor-Leste are largely practical, as many areas of the country are hard to access due to geographical constraints and poor levels of roading infrastructure which can impact the ability of those in more remote areas to participate in elections.Dr Michael Leach \\"In Timor-Leste, more power-sharing likely but election hard to pick\\" Asia Pacific Report . This has limited the ability of smaller parties to compete in some areas, as the better funded CNRT and Fretilin are more able to transport their supporters to polling stations. There is also a risk that political participation will decline due to the relative lack of progress in dealing with continuous domestic challenges and the lack of decentralisation to promote self- governance and self reliance, although so far this has not had a major impact.Dr Khoo Ying Hooi \\"The Importance of Timor-Leste's 2017 Elections\\" The Diplomat . The convention of large political coalitions has also been identified as a potential risk to the health of Timor-Leste's democracy. Dr Michael Leach observes that since 2012, the two largest parties in government (the CNRT and Fretilin) have been in a 'grand coalition', a remarkable development since prior to the agreement, there were bitter tensions between the two parties. He notes that this recent trend towards coalitions is the result of a strong desire by Timorese politicians to facilitate stability after the instability and violence of previous years, although he also observes that such coalitions can risk undermining the accountability of the government due to the absence of a major opposition outside of government. In 2015 Francisco Guterres (the Fretilin candidate) was endorsed by prime minister Xanana Gusm√£o, his erstwhile rival, and won with over 60 percent of the vote, showing that a large proportion of voters currently prefer the power sharing arrangement, despite its drawbacks. The generational divide within government roles may pose a significant challenge in the next few years. While posts such as the prime minister and chief justice are held by the younger generation, it appears that the veterans of the \\"1975 generation\\" retain most of the power behind the scenes, limiting the effectiveness of later generations to influence political society. Leach predicts this will gradually change in future elections as a greater proportion of voters come from generations with no experience of the struggle for independence. The relative ineffectiveness of the Timorese judiciary in promoting and upholding rights has led to many citizens and civil society seeking other methods to realise their rights and political participation through lobbying has become more common due to its effectiveness in achieving results, although this depends on the priorities of the politicians involved.Laura Grenfell \\"Realising Rights in Timor Leste\\" (2015) 39:2 Asian Studies Review 266 at 281.  Land rights  =Constitutional context= Land issues are currently the third largest source of complaints to the PDJH, Timor-Leste's national human rights institution.Khoo Ying Hooi \\"Silverio Pinto Baptista on Human Rights Challenges in Timor-Leste\\" The Diplomat . Until 1 June 2017 there was no overarching land law to regulate such issues.Government of Timor-Leste \\"Enactment of Land Law major step for Development\\" . Article 54 of the Constitution of Timor-Leste guarantees the right to private property. It also states that private property should not be used to the detriment of its social purpose, that only national citizens have the right to ownership of land, and that \\"requisitioning and expropriation of property for public purposes shall only take place following fair compensation in accordance with the law\\".Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste 2002, art 54. In practice, however, these protections have not always been implemented.U.S. Department of State \\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016\\" at 8. While a specific right to land is not codified in international law, the issues involved cut across many rights.Elisabeth Wickeri and Anil Kalhan \\"Land Rights Issues in International Human Rights Law\\" Institute for Human Rights and Business . at 1. In Timor- Leste these include non-discrimination, women's rights, rights to housing, and the right to work (due to the heavy reliance on agriculture). =Current issues= Land issues are complicated by the legacy of the Portuguese and Indonesian occupations in the years prior to independence. During both regimes, land was confiscated from its traditional owners by force and consolidated into the hands of loyalists, a policy that created substantial ethnic and regional divisions.Meabh Cryan \\"Empty land? The Politics of Land in Timor-Leste\\" in Sue Ingram and Lia Kent and Andrew McWilliam A New Era? Timor- Leste after the UN (ANU Press 2015) 141 at 143. When the Indonesian military withdrew from the country in 1999, the military and affiliated militia groups destroyed an estimated 70 per cent of existing structures and took the country's land records with them, resulting in a situation where many are without title to the land they live on.Meabh Cryan \\"Empty land? The Politics of Land in Timor-Leste\\" in Sue Ingram and Lia Kent and Andrew McWilliam A New Era? Timor-Leste after the UN (ANU Press 2015) 141 at 143. High levels of population displacement as a result of the violence have further complicated matters. While a 2016 survey found that 87 per cent of residents in Dili considered themselves the owners of the land where they lived, only just over half of respondents said they had legal title to it.Bernardo Almeida and Todd Wassel \\"Survey on Access to Land, Tenure Security and Land Conflicts in Timor- Leste\\" (December 2016) Asia Foundation at 4. The problem is even more severe in the countryside, where many hold land only through customary and informal systems, systems that have no legal recognition. Resource and staffing constraints have also resulted in a substantial backlog in the courts, making it difficult to seek a legal remedy and there have been reported cases of abuse from the security services in conducting evictions. According to this survey, despite high levels of perceived ownership, the majority of households in Dili fear to varying degrees that they will be evicted in five years.Bernardo Almeida and Todd Wassel \\"Survey on Access to Land, Tenure Security and Land Conflicts in Timor-Leste\\" (December 2016) Asia Foundation at 5. Government land acquisitions for development projects, particularly in the Oecusse and Suia districts, have been heavily criticised by NGOs, particularly for disregarding many private claims and evicting residents from land where the title is unclear. Prior to the 2017 law, government policy did not provide compensation for confiscated land that the occupier did not have title to. While this policy was not always maintained in practice, compensation in any case has been inconsistent and some Suai communities have complained that the alternative housing provided by the government did not meet their needs and the resulting relocations significantly changed their lives and cultural practices. These practices risk breaching Timor Leste's obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which it has ratified. Article 11.1 of the ICESCR states that ‚Äúeveryone has the right to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including food, housing and water‚Äù,United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (opened for signature 16 December 1966, entered into force 3 January 1976), art 11.1 whilst Article 17.1 of the ICCPR states that ‚Äúeveryone has the right not to be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home, or correspondence‚Äù.International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (opened for signature 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976), art 17.1 However, the U.S. Department of State notes that the Timorese government typically prefers to prioritise matters of perceived national importance over those of human rights and while some action has been taken to prosecute those involved in abuses, public perceptions of impunity persist.U.S. Department of State \\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016\\" at 2. There were four recommendations from other countries regarding land issues in Timor Leste's 2016 Universal Periodic Review.UPR Info \\"Database of Recommendations: Timor-Leste\\" www.upr-info.org There were three recommendations to take measures to eliminate gender discrimination and women's rights to land ownership while Indonesia recommended the completion of statutes to protect human rights including land. Timor-Leste accepted three recommendations and noted Canada's recommendation to remove discriminatory provisions from legislation. =Reforms= The Timorese government has acknowledged the need for reform. In its 2016 report as part of the Universal Periodic Review, it acknowledged that the right to property is enshrined in Article 54.1 of the Constitution.Timor-Leste \\"National Report\\" at 76. Furthermore, the Government affirmed its intentions to continue the development of a land law package to protect these rights and the creation of a real estate fund, in part to provide appropriate compensation for land acquisition. On 6 February 2017 the National Parliament of Timor-Leste unanimously approved the Special Regime for the Ownership of Immovable Property, more commonly known as the 'Land Law', and it was officially enacted on the 1 June 2017. The purpose of the law is ‚Äúto clarify the legal status of land ownership by bringing into effect the different dimensions of the right to private property provided for in the Constitution of Timor-Leste‚Äù. It also provides criteria for the resolution of ownership disputes and will create a National Land Registry to manage property titles. As of September 2017, there have been no major reports on the effectiveness of the law in achieving these objectives. Women's rights In East Timor, women are often deemed to have a lesser status than men,Asia Pacific Online Network of Women in Politics, Governance and Transformative Leadership, , ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Rights in East Timor (2001)‚Äù. despite the constitution guaranteeing equality.Government of Timor-Leste, , ‚ÄúConstitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste‚Äù, ss 16 & 17.

A continuing effort on behalf of the government, the UN, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs,) has resulted in some improvement, and the recently introduced Law Against Domestic Violence should assist by providing a framework for government, police and community responses to domestic violence. Children's rights There are major issues regarding abuse of children, lack of education and high levels of malnourishment. Child abuse, including physical and psychological abuse and sexual violence is a serious problem in East Timor. Additionally, corporal punishment is still used to discipline children at school and at home. The majority of incidents of violence against children are not formally reported and there are inadequate judicial remedies. There have also been reports of commercial sexual exploitation of minors, and child labour is widespread. Additionally, in some instances, parents have indentured their children in order to settle debts. Although the constitution states that primary education is compulsory,Government of Timor-Leste, , ‚ÄúConstitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste‚Äù, s 59. there is no legislation establishing a minimum level of education, nor a system to ensure free education is provided. Statistics from the UN in 2009 showed that approximately 20 percent of primary school-age children nationwide were not enrolled in school, with even higher levels of non-enrolment in rural areas. < There are also high levels of child malnutrition and infant and child mortality, which the government, in conjunction with UNICEF, is working towards reducing through the ‚Äúnational nutrition strategy‚Äù. It is hoped that the newly established East Timor National Commission on Child Rights, mandated to promote, defend, and monitor child rights will improve the situation. National human rights institutions The national institution of human rights is the Provedor de Direitos Humanos e Justi√ßa (The Provedor for Human Rights and Justice (PDHJ),) which has played a key role in promoting and protecting rights since its establishment in June 2005. Its mandate is to investigate complaints of human rights violations, maladministration and corruption, and to carry out monitoring, advocacy and promotional activities. However, there is a need for a PDHJ presence in the regions, as at present complainants from the districts need to travel to Dili to lodge complaints, thus inhibiting the process. In the districts where the Provedoria is not yet established, NGO members often fulfill the role of monitoring rights.

It is distinguished from proselytizing, or active attempts of persuasion and solicitation toward conversion, but it is distinguished from the traditional rabbinical policies regarding prospective proselytes (i.e., rejection of inquirees' requests three times before acceptance) in that programs for conversion are opened to first- time inquirees. Ancient Judaic proselytization According to Fishkoff, Judaism was openly proselytized both inside and outside of Israel in ancient times, with the population of Jews eventually coming to total at least 8 million people, or 10 percent of the population of the Roman Empire, by the first century. This large population was curtailed by Roman prohibitions on the Judeans and their religion due to frequent attempts at secession, and the prohibitions set in place were further aggravated by the rise of Christianity as a state religion, which resulted in declaring conversion to Judaism as a capital offense CE 407. Modern era The term was popularized by Gary A. Tobin (1949-2009) of the Institute for Jewish & Community Research in San Francisco, who championed a more open religious approach to converts and prospects and established a number of initiatives towards that end. His purpose was to \\"for a greater ethnic and racial diversity among Jews\\" and considered the conversion of more people to Judaism a \\"great mitzvah\\". One of the first individuals to openly advocate for proactive conversion, however, was Leo Baeck, who spoke in favor of a \\"missionary center\\" for the training of Reform rabbis to openly seek for prospective converts during a 1949 address to the World Union for Progressive Judaism. In 1978, Alexander Schindler urged Reform rabbis of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations to begin offering Judaism to \\"unchurched\\" gentiles who are not specifically attached to a Christian denomination; he repeated this call in 1994, and the Union's outreach department finally established \\"A Taste of Judaism,\\" which would offer a preliminary view of Judaism for first-time prospectives. A similar program operated by Conservative Jews, the Miller Introduction to Judaism Program, has been operated in 1986 at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles. In 1997, Conservative rabbi Harold Schulweis created a Keruv ('outreach') Center in Encino, California; \\"Turning potential converts away by telling them the Noahide Laws are good enough for them, whereas Judaism's treasures are to be saved for an elite few, is, Schulweis argues, promulgating a particularist notion of Judaism that is profoundly un-Jewish.\\" Bibliography * Tobin, Gary A.

Synopsis The film centers on Mika Kitao (ÂåóÂ∞æ ÂÆüÂä† Kitao Mika; Hikari Ishida), the clumsy and slow younger sister of Chizuko Kitao (ÂåóÂ∞æ ÂçÉÊ¥•Â≠ê Kitao Chizuko; Tomoko Nakajima), shortly after Chizuko dies in a freak accident. Although the sisters were very close, it is apparent that Mika lived in the shadow of her older sister's accomplishments. One night, Mika is almost raped by a stranger while walking alone outside. However, during the attack, a person resembling Chizuko silently gestures towards a rock on the ground, which Mika uses to hit her assailant and get away safely. A few days later, the ghost of Chizuko appears again, admitting that she had been watching over Mika since her death; had Mika not been attacked, she probably would have stayed invisible. Chizuko implores Mika to go to a symphonic concert with Mika's best friend, Mako. At the concert, a man named Tomoya Kaminaga (Á•ûÊ∞∏Âì≤‰πü Kaminaga Tomoya) mistakens Mika for Chizuko; he and Chizuko were lovers, and had agreed to meet at the concert. Mika reveals that Chizuko is dead, which Kaminaga did not know. Mika's parents attend a piano recital that she is playing in. However, Mika's mother expresses concern that Mika will not be able to match the piano prowess of her older sister. Although Mika is nervous, Chizuko encourages her, and she performs well. Kaminaga also appears at the recital, presenting Mika with roses. Later, Mika and Mako participate in a relay race. Mika becomes tired while running, but Chizuko again appears to motivate her to do well. Mika's parents, while watching her sprint through the finish line, comment that she looks like Chizuko. Mika becomes nervous after misplacing a love letter she had written to Kaminaga; the next day at school, several of her classmates have photocopies of the letter, which they use to tease her. Kaminaga later apologizes to Mika, revealing that his cousin Mariko (another girl in Mika and Mako's class) distributed the letter. Mako and Mika go to Mariko's house to tell her off, but only find her mother, who says that no one is supposed to be in the house, and that Mariko is staying with relatives. Mako concludes that her family must be bankrupt. After Mika returns from a family trip, Mako breaks down and reveals that her father had died while Mika was away. That night, Mika receives a phone call from Mariko, who apologizes for stealing her love letter. Mariko says that she was jealous of Kaminaga and Chizuko's relationship, and because of that, disliked Mika as well. She then tells Mika that she and her mother are planning to commit suicide after she hangs up. Mika becomes distraught, but is unable to figure out where Mariko is. However, Mariko appears at school afterwards, and thanks Mika for saving her life. Mika and Mako graduate from junior high. At their high school, everyone suggests that Mika play the leading role in the school play; this is the same role that Chizuko had previously performed. Meanwhile, Mika's father is forced to relocate for work, which upsets her mother. Later, Mika's mother receives a phone call that Mika has been hurt in an accident; this exacerbates her already-fragile psychological health, and she is admitted into a hospital. In actuality, Mika was not hurt, and she is left to take care of her family's house alone. Due to her familial situation, Mika declines to perform the leading role in the play, instead becoming the prop master. While taking a cast and crew photograph, the girl with the leading role reveals that she had made the phone call to Mika's mother; Mika slaps her and walks away in disgust. Mika's father again returns home for the New Year holiday. Mika's mother is taken out of the hospital for the holiday as well. However, Mika walks into the living room and finds a woman apologizing to Mika's mother; it becomes clear that Mika's father has had an affair. Mika's mother breaks down again, fearing that everyone is trying to abandon her. Mika follows her father outside and witnesses him kissing his mistress one last time. After helping her mother to bed, Mika reprimands her father for his actions and denounces his mistress as a bad person. Her father slaps her and tells her to go to her room. Mika finds a letter-opening knife in Chizuko's room and decides to stab her father with it. Chizuko pleads with her to calm down, but Mika tells her to \\"go away\\"; Chizuko begins to cry as Mika goes downstairs with the knife. As she is about to stab her father from behind, Mika realizes that her father is crying, and then witnesses her parents reconciling. She goes back to Chizuko's room and tries to apologize to Chizuko, but finds that she is no longer there. Mika then looks in the mirror and sees Chizuko; she tells her to come out, but Chiuzko says that she is in the \\"other world\\" and cannot return. Mika's mother walks into the room and asks Mika what she is looking at; Mika says that, for a moment, she looked like Chizuko, which she finds strange, as they don't look much alike. Mika's mother says that, in fact, she looks exactly like Chizuko, but has her own personality. Kaminaga asks Mika to travel around the world with him, but she declines, preferring to stay in her town. Mika begins to write about Chizuko, saying that this is another way to be with her.

Works  Theodore wrote an exegesis on the Gospels and a poem on S√¥phrosyn√® (Temperance) which may be attributed to him. = Tribiblos = Theodore's main work is his Astronomical Tribiblos, in three books, whose autograph manuscript is preserved (Vaticanus gr. 792), was composed before 1352. The work deals with an assortment of mathematical and astronomical issues and draws from some earlier Greek authors like George Pachymeres and Theodore Metochites. The second book is devoted to Ptolemy, whose calculations he explained in the manner of Theon of Alexandria. Finally, in book 3 he devotes himself to Persian astronomy, drawing especially from George Chrysokokkes, whose work he corrected in many places. In all of them, he explicitly condemns Astrology, dissociating his Astronomy from the Persian tradition represented by Chrysokokkes. The pedagogical character of the Tribiblos is obvious and it may have been used to give senior astronomy training to the Byzantine clergy.

It binds to CD38, which multiple myeloma cells overexpress. Daratumumab was originally developed by Genmab, but it is now being jointly developed by Genmab along with the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Biotech, which acquired worldwide commercialization rights to the drug from Genmab. Daratumumab was given breakthrough therapy drug status in 2013, for multiple myeloma. It was awarded orphan drug status for multiple myeloma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma.  Medical uses  In November 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved daratumumab for treatment of multiple myeloma in people who had received at least three prior therapies.{{cite weburl=https://www.centerwatch.com/drug- information/fda-approved-drugs/drug/100115/darzalex-daratumumabtitle=Darzalex New FDA Drug Approval website=CenterWatch } In May 2016 daratumumab was also conditionally approved by the European Medicines Agency for treatment of multiple myeloma. In November 2016, the FDA approved daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide or bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of people with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. In May 2018, the FDA expanded the approval of daratumumab for use in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone to include the treatment of people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation on 20 May 2016. In the European Union it is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.  Side effects  Treatment of multiple myeloma with daratumumab potentially increases the patient's susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections, due to the killing of natural killer cells (which are the main innate immune system defense against virus). Daratumumab frequently causes human cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation by an unknown mechanism. Injection related reactions (inflammation-like) are also common.  Interactions  = Interference with blood compatibility testing = Daratumumab can also bind to CD38 present on red blood cells and interfere with routine testing for clinically significant antibodies. People will show a panreactive antibody panel, including a positive auto-control, which tends to mask the presence of any clinically significant antibodies. Treatment of the antibody panel cells with dithiothreitol (DTT) and repeating testing will effectively negate the binding of daratumumab to CD38 on the red blood cell surface; however, DTT also inactivates/destroys many antigens on the red blood cell surface by disrupting disulfide bonds. The only antigen system affected that is associated with common, clinically significant antibodies is Kell, making crossmatch testing with K-negative RBCs a reasonable alternative when urgent transfusion is indicated. It is therefore advisable to do a baseline antibody screen and Rh & Kell phenotyping (type and screen) before starting the therapy. If antibody screen is negative, proceed with phenotype matched transfusions during therapy. If antibody screen is positive, give specific antigen negative blood. The incompatibility may persist for up to 6 months after stopping the medicine. Furthermore, blood transfusion centers should be routinely notified when sending such a sample. Interaction with flow cytometry testing Daratumumab can also interfere with flow cytometric evaluation of multiple myeloma, causing an apparent lack of plasma cells.  Pharmacology  = Mechanism of action = Daratumumab is an IgG1k monoclonal antibody directed against CD38. CD38 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells. Daratumumab binds to a different CD38 epitope amino-acid sequence than does the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody isatuximab. Daratumumab binds to CD38, causing cells to apoptose via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. These effects are dependent upon fragment crystallizable region immune effector mechanisms. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity is by means of natural killer cells. Unlike isatuximab which causes apoptosis directly, daratumumab only induces apoptosis indirectly. Multiple myeloma cells with higher levels of CD38 show greater daratumumab-mediated cell lysis than cells with low CD38 expression. CD38 enzyme results in the formation of the immunosuppressive substance adenosine, so eliminating CD38-containing cells increases the ability of the immune system to eliminate cancer.  History  Encouraging preliminary results were reported in June 2012, from a Phase I/II clinical trial in relapsed multiple myeloma participants. Updated trial results presented in December 2012, indicate daratumumab is continuing to show promising single-agent anti-myeloma activity. A 2015 study compared monotherapy 8 and 16 mg/kg at monthly to weekly intervals. Daratumumab was given priority review status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for multiple myeloma as a combination therapy (second line). Daratumumab phase III trials for multiple myeloma show great promise in combination therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, as well as with bortezomib and dexamethasone.

He also used the titles of Duke of M√ºnsterberg and Count of Glatz, although he never ruled those territories. From 1629 to 1639 he was Governor of Silesia.  Life  Henry Wenceslaus was a member of the M√ºnsterberg branch of the noble House of Podƒõbrady. His parents were Duke Charles II of M√ºnsterberg-Oels and Elisabeth Magdalena (1562‚Äì1630), daughter of the Duke George II of Brieg. Henry Wenceslaus was appointed in 1608 as rector of the Viadrina European University in Frankfurt (Oder). Following a Grand Tour through Europe, he was Commissioner for the imperial army of Silesia and Imperial Council. After his father's death in 1617, he took up government of the Duchy of Bernstadt. At the same time he and his younger brother Charles Frederick inherited the Moravian dominions of ≈†ternberk and Jevi≈°ovice. Together with his brother Charles Frederick, Henry Wenceslaus welcomed in February 1620 in his North Moravian town of ≈†ternberk, King Frederick V of Bohemia, who had been newly elected in 1619 and was on his way to Breslau to receive homage. Henry Wenceslaus invited the composer and hymn writer Matth√§us Apelt to Bernstadt in 1625 and appointed him in 1631 as secretary of his chancellery. In 1627, Henry Wenceslaus attended the coronation in Prague of the later Emperor Ferdinand III as King of Bohemia. After Duke Georg Rudolf resigned in 1628 as Landeshauptmann of Silesia, an imperial decree reduced the political influence of future office holders. In 1629, King Ferdinand III appointed Henry Wenceslaus to the office, after the latter had promised to respect the freedom of religion. When in 1632, the Protestant princes of Silesia approached to Swedish and Saxon invaders, Henry Wenceslaus, who remained loyal to the emperor, refused to convene the Estates and temporarily left the country. Henry Wenceslaus never lost not the imperial favor, unlike his brother Charles Frederick, who in 1633, together with Duke John Christian of Brieg and George Rudolf of Liegnitz and the City Council of Breslau joined a defensive league, which sought the protection of Saxony, Brandenburg and Sweden. In 1637, Henry Wenceslaus awarded town privileges to the town of Miƒôdzyb√≥rz. He died in 1639 and was buried in Ole≈õnica. His brother Charles Frederick succeeded him as Duke of Bernstadt.  Marriages and Issue  * On 7 November 1617 he married Anna Magdalena of Wittelsbach, Countess Palatine of Veldenz (b. 1602 ‚Äì d. 1630), daughter of George Gustavus, Count Palatine of Veldenz. This marriage was childless. * On 26 August 1636 he married secondly and morganatically Anna Ursula of Reibnitz (b. ca. 1616 ‚Äì d. 1 January 1657), who on 16 January 1637 in Regensburg, by King of the Romans Ferdinand III was raised to the rank of Princess of Bernstadt.

It contains a record of geodynamic processes during one of the most important episodes of continental growth in Phanerozoic time. Location The CAOB stretches from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, occupying an area of about 5.3 million square kilometers, about 11% of the Asian surface area. It is bounded on the north by the Siberian craton and on the south by the North China craton and the Tarim craton, which provides substrate for the Tarim Basin. The CAOB encompasses parts of six nations: China, Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. It includes mountain ranges north of Tibet, including the Tian Shan (Chinese for \\"heavenly mountains\\") where a good example of Paleozoic arc accretion is exposed. The Altai Mountains of Russia, Kazakhstan, northwest China and western Mongolia also expose a complex accretionary terrane. CAOB rocks are also well exposed in Kazakhstan, the South Gobi Range of southern Mongolia, the Beishan and Inner Mongolia of northern China, the Sayan Mountains of southern Siberia just north of Mongolia, the ranges of Buryatia in southern Siberia south of Lake Baikal, and in the Far East of China and Russia. Geologic evolution There has been much discussion about the tectonic evolution of the CAOB over the last two decades, and these interpretations fall into two general groups. ages of detrital zircons from sediments of five Russian rivers, after . Note 4 age peaks, from most to least important: 1) Paleozoic (250-500 million years old (Ma)); 2) Paleoproterozoic (~1.8 billion years old (Ga)); 3) Archean (~2,7 Ga); and 4) Neoproterozoic (530-1000 Ma). Many Paleoproterozoic ages come from surrounding cratons, Paleozoic ages mostly come from CAOB and Urals One group of researchers suggests that the belt grew, in the Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic, from the margin of the Siberian craton to the south through accretion of island arcs and Precambrian continental blocks until the evolution was terminated through collision with the North China and Tarim cratons in the latest Paleozoic to early Mesozoic.; ; The original paleogeographic position of the continental blocks is debated, but some studies suggest a Gondwana affinity of many allochthonous terranes,; whereas others infer a Siberian or Tarim origin for the same blocks .; The second group of researchers regards the CAOB as mainly composed of a huge Paleozoic subduction-accretion complex, which accumulated against a single, long magmatic arc. The CAOB, like other major accretionary orogens, consists of: # accretionary wedges; # island arc, forearc and back-arc systems, largely dismembered ophiolites, oceanic plateaux; # blocks of older continental crust, ranging in age from Archaean to Neoproterozoic; # synorogenic granite and metamorphic rocks including exhumed HP-UHP metamorphic rocks, # clastic sedimentary basins; # Permian post-collisional granitoids and intraplate igneous suites. Large-scale late Paleozoic shear zones follow the orogenic grain. There are many controversies about CAOB tectono-magmatic evolution. One is the problem of juvenile versus recycled crust in the formation of CAOB igneous rocks. On one hand, the CAOB is considered to be the most important site of juvenile crust formation since the Neoproterozoic, because during its amalgamation, which involved terrains of different geodynamic origin overlain by magmatic units, massive amounts of granitic magmas were generated with juvenile Nd isotopic signatures. However, recently obtained detrital and xenocrystic zircon ages confirmed an important role for older crust in the orogen's evolution.E.g., ; ; The modest Neoproterozoic and huge early-middle Paleozoic zircon age spectra match CAOB crustal growth very well but older peaks of ~1.8 Ga and ~2.7 Ga suggest the involvement of older crust.

Overview The park was created by the Soviets in the mid-1930s in place of an old graveyard around the Church of St. Nicholas, which, as the story goes, marks the place where Prince Askold of Kyiv was buried in the 9th century.http://www.kievtown.net/rus/sights/askold.htm In the Middle Ages, Askold's Grave was known as the Uhorske urochishche (\\"locality\\", \\"tract\\"). According to the Primary Chronicle, it was the place where the Magyars crossed the Dnieper on the way from the Russian steppes to Pannonia. Archeological excavations have revealed a 9th-century dirham hoard and some remains of Izyaslav II's wooden palace. There's a modern stele commemorating the Magyar migration. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Askold's Grave was settled by the Orthodox monks of St. Nicholas's Monastery. Hetman Mazepa had the monastery moved to a nearby hill, where a new Baroque penticupolar cathedral was then erected. The existing church of St. Nicholas \\"Slupsky\\" is a modest Neoclassical rotunda designed by Andrey Melensky in 1810. A new golden- domed chapel was built on the bank of the Dnieper in 2000. The style is Ukrainian Baroque revival.http://mesta.kiev.ua/churches/237-cerkov-andreja- pervozvannogo.html The chapel is dedicated to Saint Andrew Protokletos and belongs to the Moscow Patriarchate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.Temple of Saint Andrew Protokletos.

He is known for his work in the areas of object-oriented databases, database systems, software engineering and e-Science and was the UK's first e-Science Envoy (2006‚Äì2011) and the Director of the e-Science Institute and National e-Science Centre, University of Edinburgh.  Professional career  Atkinson obtained his first degree from the University of Cambridge in 1966, followed by a Diploma in computer science in 1967. After three years research and teaching at Lancaster University he returned to Cambridge and was awarded his PhD in 1974. He then held academic posts in Burma, Cambridge, East Anglia and Edinburgh, being appointed to a senior lectureship at the University of Edinburgh in 1983. He was a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania during 1983‚Äì84 and was appointed to a professorship in computer science at the University of Glasgow in 1984.Who, Where and When: The History & Constitution of the University of Glasgow http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_61834_en.pdf He was head of Department of Computing Science from 1986 to 1990, following which he spent nine months on sabbatical at INRIA near Paris working with the O2 group. Atkinson then worked for Sun Microsystems (at SunLabs in California) before moving to the University of Edinburgh in 2001 as Professor in the School of Informatics. He has more than 100 publications listed on DBLP.Publication of Malcolm P. Atkinson on DBLP http://www.informatik.uni- trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Atkinson:Malcolm_P=.html In 1994, he was elected as a fellow List of current fellows http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/lists/fellows.pdf of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in the Royal Society of Edinburgh. = UK e-Science envoy = A call for applications for the role of e-Science Senior Research Fellow for the e-Science Core Programme was issued by the Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in 2005. Atkinson was the successful candidate and started his work as the e-Science Envoy on 1 April 2006 under EPSRC Grant No EP/D079829/1. Consequently, he stepped down as the director of the UK National e-Science Centre. The director post was taken up by Professor Peter Clarke who held it until August 2009. = Director, e-Science Institute = He founded the e-Science Institute in August 2001,as a central focus for the e-Science community in the UK. Its mission was to stimulate the creation of new insights in e-Science and computing science by bringing together international experts and enabling them to successfully address significant and diverse challenges. In January 2007, he appointed Jano van Hemert as Research Leader of the UK National e-Science Centre located at 15 South College Street, Edinburgh, UK. Soon after, they founded the Edinburgh Data- Intensive Research Group. This group became the focus of all e-Science research in the University of Edinburgh. In July 2009, the group joined the Centre for Intelligent Systems and their Applications (CISA) soon after the group had moved into the Informatics Forum. In September 2010, the group merged with the research group of Prof Dave Robertson, then the Head of School of University of Edinburgh School of Informatics. = Database research = Atkinson has pursued a career working as a researcher in database systems in both academia and industry. Among Atkinson's best known achievements are his influential work on Object-Oriented Database Systems, as presented in the Object-Oriented Database System Manifesto (with Fran√ßois Bancilhon, David DeWitt, Klaus Dittrich, David Maier, and Stanley Zdonik), and his work designing OGSA-DAI, a web-service platform for distributed data access, integration and management used internationally in scientific applications. In the early stages of his career, he worked closely with Carol Linden and Neil Wiseman on the Intermediate Data Language. He identified the value of orthogonal persistence at VLDB in 1978 and led the team that built the first orthogonally persistent programming language, PS-algol, in 1980. With Norman Paton, Vijay Dialani, Dave Pearson, Tony Storey and Paul Watson, he was a member of the UK Database Task Force which published the blueprint for Database Access and Integration Services to foster a wider activity on the formulation of standards for databases and the Grid. From 2003‚Äì2008 he served on the steering group of the Open Grid Forum as Data Area Chair. He is co- author of the Web Services Data Access and Integration (WS-DAI) Specification. He has had a long association with the Very Large Database (VLDB) conference series, and was Programme Committee Chair of VLDB 99. He has been instrumental in setting up the XLDB-Europe series of satellite workshops which identify trends, commonalities and major roadblocks related to building eXtremely Large Data Bases (currently referring to databases whose size is 1 petabyte or greater).  Biography  = Early years = Atkinson was born in East Anglia where his father was in the RAF bomber command, on what is now Stansted Airport. They lived in Wembley for part of the war and after his father was demobbed moved to Flushing in Cornwall where his father managed an Electrical company. His first memory of his home in Cornwall was seeing the sea at the bottom of their garden. He spent a childhood on the beach, bringing seafood home for meals. He had an interest in boats and sailing, first a rowing boat, then an Enterprise sailing dinghy that he built himself and then yachts. On at least one occasion he attempted to rescue people from the sea. He won many prizes as a dinghy sailor. He learned electrics from his father, assisting him connecting farms to the new national grid. They also went down mines and clay- pits to install winding gears. The village school he attended had a single class, and teacher Miss Copp (untrained) was an inspiration to him. She advised his parents that he had the potential to attend the University of Cambridge while young, and also reprimanded him for his early difficulties in writing. He went on to attend Falmouth Grammar, and travelled to school by boat, crossing the Fal Estuary. He contracted rheumatic fever and was unable to attend school for a year during which time he read many science books. = University = Atkinson got a Scholarship to Cambridge where he read Physics. He started in 1962. Having passed everything needed for a first class honours degree by the end of his 2nd year was able to spend his third year on different subjects. He stayed on for a fourth year to do the new Diploma in Computing. = Personal = He met his first wife Valerie Ross in Cambridge and they were married in 1967. They left Cambridge to start the department of Computer Science at the new Lancaster University and their first daughter, Kirsteen, was born there. Later they had two more daughters, Tamzyn and Janna. Valerie died in 1994. He is married to Kathy Humphry whom he first met in 1978 at the University of Edinburgh where she was a Computing Officer. = Miscellaneous events and interests = Atkinson was instrumental in setting up a Mining Society at the grammar school. He is an avid dinghy sailor and has won many prizes. He once went cruising on a French crabber which was confiscated for smuggling (it had been bought by a customs officer). He won \\"The Scotsman ‚Äì Innovator of the Year\\" Prize in 2002, sponsored by Glenfiddich.

Prior to his appointment to the Irish High Court Bench in 1606 he had been Attorney General for Ireland for more than 20 years. He was a close political associate of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir John Perrot. Perrot's downfall damaged his career, but he was eventually restored to Royal favour.  Early life  He belonged to an old Norfolk family; his father was Francis Calthorpe of Hempstead and his mother was Elizabeth Berney of Gunton.Ball 1926, p. 318 He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1560. He gave readings on the law of copyhold at Furnivall's Inn, which were published in 1562. He was called to the bar in 1569 and became a Bencher of his Inn in 1582. He sat in the House of Commons as member for Eye in the Parliament of 1572. In 1584 he was appointed Attorney General for Ireland and was a staunch supporter of the Lord Deputy, Sir John Perrot. From the outset of his career in Ireland Calthorpe was subject to intense criticism from his political opponents, who accused him of partisanship, inefficient management of business, insufficient legal learning and undue deference to his Irish colleagues. These attacks mounted after Perrot's recall in 1588, but Calthorpe managed to retain office, possibly due to the perennial difficulty in finding a suitable candidate for the office of Attorney General. Given his long tenure of that office, it may well be that he was a more efficient public servant than his critics claimed. Family Calthorpe married firstly Winifred Toto, daughter of the celebrated Italian-born painter Anthony Toto, who was Serjeant Painter to Henry VIII and Edward VI. She died in 1605. He married secondly Dorothy Deane, who had been twice married already; she outlived him by a few months. He had no children by either marriage.  Perrot's downfall  The final downfall of Calthorpe's patron, Lord Deputy Perrot, who was convicted of treason in 1592 and died in the Tower of London while awaiting execution, had major repercussions in Ireland. His close ally Nicholas White, the Master of the Rolls in Ireland, was arrested on the same charge, and like Perrot he died in the Tower. It was widely believed that Calthorpe would suffer a similar fate. He was accused of corruption by two dubious characters: Henry Bird, a former royal clerk, and an eccentric ex-priest called Denis O'Roghan. Bird had been convicted of forging Perrot's signature on O'Roghan's evidence:Crawford 2006, pp. 261‚Äì2 Calthorpe had prosecuted the case with great vigour and there is no reason to doubt that he believed that Bird was guilty. O'Roghan however retracted his evidence against Bird, and made charges of treason against Perrot. Sir William Fitzwilliam, the new Lord Deputy, set up an inquiry, but O'Roghan's charges were so wildly implausible that it seemed doubtful whether the inquiry could proceed. A second commission of inquiry was then set up into the manner in which the charges were made. Calthorpe sat on this commission, which proved to be a serious mistake when O'Roghan accused the commissioners of subjecting him to torture. Fitzwilliam was now ordered by the English Crown to resume his own inquiry, and Calthorpe faced two serious charges: of wrongly pressing for Bird's conviction, and of acting corruptly in the examination of O'Roghan. He was suspended from office between 1590 and 1592, and it was widely believed that he would be prosecuted. In February 1591 he wrote to Burghley, the English elder statesman, pleading for his protection. Given that Burghley was a close associate of Fitzwilliam, he might seem an unlikely patron of Calthorpe, but he was generally inclined to moderation, and in the event it was decided that a severe censure of Calthorpe's conduct was a sufficient penalty. Calthorpe also suffered the embarrassment of seeing the conviction of Henry Bird publicly reversed. He was restored to office in the autumn of 1592, but his reputation never fully recovered. Molyneux case In 1594 the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) was asked to rule on whether Sir Thomas Molyneux, the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, was eligible for public office.Gilbert, John Thomas \\" Thomas Molyneux\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900 Vol. 38 p.137 Molyneux, though of English origin, had been born and raised in Calais and lived for some years in Bruges, where he married a Belgian wife. His enemies accordingly suggested that he was a foreigner and a Roman Catholic. Calthorpe, having questioned Molyneux, informed the Court that he was a Protestant Englishman, and as such fully qualified to hold public office.Gilbert p.137  Later life  Complaints about his inefficiency mounted: in 1597 the Privy Council of Ireland lamented that none of the Law Officers, except the Solicitor-General for Ireland, Roger Wilbraham, did the Crown's business properly.Hart, A. R. History of the Kings Serjeants at law in Ireland Four Courts Press Dublin 2000 p.42 Calthorpe began pressing for promotion to what he no doubt hoped would be the less stressful life of a High Court judge. He was offered the position of Chief Justice of Munster, but refused it (the work of that office was extremely onerous, and clearly it did not appeal to him) and sought the office of Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas instead. On hearing that the salary of that office was about to be reduced he withdrew his application. In his later years he seems to have seriously neglected his duties at the Attorney General's Office: in 1604 he was living in London, and the following year Sir Arthur Chichester, the new Lord Deputy, complained of Calthorpe's inefficiency, although he was given a knighthood the same year. Finally the decision to appoint Sir John Davies as Attorney General made it desirable to find a promotion for Calthorpe, and in 1606 he at last reached the Bench as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). He was not a success as a judge : in 1611 he was described as old, weak and unable to perform his official duties, although he remained on the Bench until his death. He died in January 1616 and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin.  Reputation  Calthorpe was judged harshly in his own time, but he has been viewed more favourably by recent historians. As Crawford points out the whole judicial process leading to the disgrace of Sir John Perrot was politically partisan, and Calthorpe, as one of Perrot's closest allies, could not have hoped to escape censure even if he was blameless. Despite the abuse heaped on him, it is notable that he retained office as Attorney General for 22 years, and even allowing that a suitable replacement may have been hard to find until the advent of Sir John Davies, this suggests that he was a competent enough official. Casey also praises him for his constructive and business-like management of the Attorney General's office,Casey 1995, p. 11 although Chichester's criticisms, and the complaints by the Privy Council about his inefficiency in 1597, suggest that he neglected his duties in his later years.

The DCPFAF aims to bring together Washington, DC's various communities through art, catalyzing conversations about film, culture, and diaspora, utilizing the lens of Palestinian filmmakers as an entry point. Background In 2011, a group of three dedicated young women founded the DCPFAF to create a platform for the artistic creativity of Palestinians, primarily through film but also through visual art, music, and other mediums. The stories shared in the DCPFAF are not necessarily about Palestine in relation to Israeli occupation, nor are they stories necessarily about Palestinians. The aim of the DCPFAF is to reflect the dynamic formation of a transnational identity common to Palestinians and diasporic communities in general. The DCPFAF launched in September 2011 after a successful two-day teaser festival that May. The DCPFAF, an entirely volunteer-run project, is incorporated in the District of Columbia as a non- governmental organization and a registered 501(c)3 entity. 2015 DCPFAF Program * The Wanted 18, by Amer Shomali and Paul Cowan * My Love Awaits Me by the Sea, by Mais Darwazah * Giraffada, by Rani Massalha * Hamule, by Mauricio Misle * Roshmia, by Salim Abu Jabal * Pioneer High, by Suha Araj * Nun wa Zaytun, by Emtiaz Diab * The Living of the Pigeons, by Baha' AbuShanab * Villa Touma, by Suha Arraf * Mars at Sunrise, by Jessica Habie * The Book of Disappearance: Arabic Literary Program with Ibtisam Azem * Layering Identities: From Architectural Heritage to Writing with Suad Amiry * Musical performance by Rahim AlHaj and the Wanees Zarour Ensemble * Photojournalism in Gaza with Eman Mohammed 2014 DCPFAF Program * Condom Lead, Tarzan and Arab * Gaza 36mm, by Khalil Al Mozayen * A World Not Ours, by Mahdi Fleifel * Cinema Palestine, by Tim Schwab and Majdi El-Omari * Where Should the Birds Fly, by Fida Qishta * Omar, by Hany Abu-Assad * May in the Summer, by Cherien Dabis * Horizon, by Zain Duraie * Yalla to the Moon, by Jacqueline Reem Salloum and Suhell Nafar * Leaving Oslo, by Yazan Khalili * From Ramallah, by Assem Nasser * Message to Obama, by Muhannad Salahat * Journey of a Sofa, by Alaa Al Ali * Apartment 10/14, by Tarzan and Arab * Interference, by Amin Nayfeh * Oslo Syndrome, by Ayman Azraq * Twenty Handshakes for Peace, by Mahdi Fleifel * Long War, by Asma Ghanem * The Huda Asfour Quartet * Lena Seikaly and Trio * Stories for Justice, Visualizing Palestine exhibit 2013 DCPFAF Program * When I Saw You, by Annemarie Jacir * Where Should the Birds Fly? by Fida Qishta * When Monaliza Smiled, by Fadi Haddad * Infiltrators, by Khaled Jarrar * Lyrics Revolt with Shannon Farhoud, Ahlene Ramadan, Melanie Fridgant, Rana Khaled Al Khatib 2012 DCPFAF Program * The Last Friday * Man Without a Cell Phone * Nukayba * Gaza: Tunnels to Nowhere * Uncle Nashaat * Palestinian Innovators: Love Under Apartheid with Tanya Keilani, Mousa Kraish, and Huda Asfour * Yousef Erakat of FouseyTube 2011 DCPFAF Program *This is My Picture When I Was Dead, by Mahmoud Al Massad *Kingdom of Women, by Dahna Abourahme * From Palestine With Love, by Mahasen Nasser-Eldin * Samia, by Mahasen Nasser-Eldin *The Time That Remains, by Elia Suleiman *Diaries, by May Odeh *Yousef Erakat of FouseyTube *Mustafa Staiti of the Freedom Theatre Further reading *Gaul, Anny and Nour Joudah. \\"Film and its Voices: The DC Palestinian Film and Arts Festival.\\" Jadaliyya, October 8, 2011.

He was noted for his unique style of playing 'Ati-Vilambit' (very slow movement applicable to 'Alap' and 'Vilambit Gat' of a raga, a very prime feature to the Indian classical music) with an extensive use of 'Micro-Tone' (application of 'Shruti') to imitate the Indian Singing style. Early life Rabin Ghosh hailed from a family with a strong musical background. His father was an Engineer and played Flute and Esraj (an Indian string instrument). From a very early age, Rabin Ghosh was influenced by the musical atmosphere, which drove him into playing Esraj, Flute, and Tabla (an Indian percussion instrument). He finally focused on Violin, under the guidance of Mr. Mani Majumder, one of the renowned violinists of the contemporary time of Western Classical Music. After continuous training on Western Classical Music he shifted to North Indian Classical Music under the guidance of 'Sangeetacharya' Haripada Chattopadhay, exponent violinist of 'Dagar Gharana' (Dagar school of thoughts) of North Indian Classical Music. Rabin Ghosh continued his training more than a decade under the tutelage of Haripada Chattopadhay. During this time he not only won violin Competitions, also performed in concerts along with All India Radio, Calcutta.  Way to Maihar  In the year 1955, Rabin Ghosh got an opportunity to play violin before Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb (at the time of visiting Calcutta), the doyen of Hindustani Classical Music. He played Raga Mian ki Todi before him. Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb was satisfied to accept him as his disciple. In the mid of 1955, Rabin Ghosh left for Maihar. = Life at Maihar = Life at Maihar for Rabin Ghosh was very dedicated. Besides receiving training from Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb, he was appointed as a teacher of Maihar Government Music College. Rabin Ghosh had a very strict and long duration practice session which he maintained till the last day in Maihar. In his own words \\"I used to light a thick fragrance stick and would continue practice till it burned out totally\\".  Contribution  At that time, Rabin Ghosh's practice sessions lasted about 12 hours a day but reached a peak of 14 to 16 hours a day. During his stay at Maihar over seven and half years, he experimented with different techniques on violin sound production and researched sitting posture which helped with the long duration of practice sessions. = Invention of 5th string on violin = During the years of rigorous training under the tutelage of Baba Alauddin Khan Saheb in Maihar, Rabin Ghosh was inspired to 'Design and Develop Five-String Violin'. The need to access and explore the lower octave in expressing the mood of Raga RamDashi Malhar, in 1958, the young artist Rabin Ghosh, had an extensive experimentation, which augmented 4 string violin to 5 string violin without compromising the original tonal quality of conventional violin. For Five- String Violin he used to use 1st string 'E‚Äô as 'Rishav' (higher octave), 2nd string 'A‚Äô as 'Pancham' (middle octave), 3rd string 'D‚Äô as 'Saraj' (middle octave), 4th string 'G‚Äô as 'Madhyam' (lower octave), and 5th string 'C‚Äô as 'Komol Nishad' (lower octave). From 1960, Rabin Ghosh used 'Five String Violin' starting with his performances at Tansen Sangeet Sanmelan, Calcutta.  Resting violin on case  Rabin Ghosh's playing style was enriched with the amalgamation of singing as well as tantrakari. He used to use extensive 'Micro-Tone' (application of 'Shruti') to imitate the Indian Singing style. Another distinct feature of his playing style was holding the violin. He used his 'specially made violin case' for resting his violin. He realised that playing could be more comfortable if the instrument is held from the both end facilitating to play finest Meend (sliding), Gamak and other technical applications. Other aspect was to avoid the 'Excessive Flexion' of the vertebral column of the performer, instead of resting violin somewhere of the body.  Introduction of Tala  Maestro Rabin Ghosh composed 'Someswara Tala' imagining the dancing posture of Nataraj, of 11 Beats, having division of 3 ‚Äì 2 ‚Äì 3 ‚Äì (1.5 + 1.5).  Composition  Going beyond the periphery of performing and teaching Maestro Rabin Ghosh has put his earnest endeavour to compose a few orchestrations on Indian Classical Music. During his tenure in Maihar, when he was completely engulfed in receiving training in Indian Classical Music from Baba Alauddin Khan Saheb, the motif kindled within his heart a unique feeling which prompted him to compose some pieces on Indian Classical Ragas completely orchestrated. The ragas in which he explored himself are Zila Kafi, Bhupali, Kirwani, Khamaj etc. His honest effort to con flux two parallel voices in a composition tuned out to be a grand success. Abhisarika, Niharika, Sanchari and more such compositions shaped between 1973 and 1992 and were staged by his disciples from time to time. A compact disc album named 'Niharika' played by his disciples was released with orchestral works.  Recordings  From 1970 and 1972 The Gramophone Company of India Limited (HMV) released Three Long Playing Discs. The stereo recordings consists solo performance of Raga Pahari Jhinjhoti, Raga Ahir Bhairav by Rabin Ghosh, Raga Gunkali with Himangshu Biswas in Flute, Patdeep (Dhun). HMV released a disk consists of Raga Brindabani Sarang,Raga Bageshree by Rabin Ghosh with Himangshu Biswas (Flute), Dinesh ch. Chandra (Sitar) and Shyamal Bose (Tabla). = Publication = Maestro Rabin Ghosh published a book 'Swarankan Sanghati' ‚Äì integration of notation system, where he described and analysed the common features as well as comparison and method of translating music between Indian Classical Music Notation System and Western Classical Music Notation System.  Teaching career  Maestro Rabin Ghosh established a new dimension in the field of Indian Classical Music on Violin. As a result, he was associated with Ali Akbar College of Music, Calcutta, Tansen Music College as teacher of violin. Rabin Ghosh was associated with Rabindra Bharati University as lecturer of Instrumental Music Department. He held the position of Examiner for Vishwa Bharati University and for Prayag Sangit Samiti. Maestro Ghosh also gave many Lecture-Demonstrations in various places, including in the Department of Music of Emory University, and Sacramento state University, California, USA.

The Kikuyu Female Circumcision Controversy, with special reference to the Church Missionary Society's sphere of influence, PhD thesis, University of California, Los Angeles. The British campaign was met with resistance by the Kikuyu people, the country's largest tribe. According to American historian Lynn M. Thomas, FGM became a focal point of the independence movement against British colonial rule, and a test of loyalty, either to the Christian churches or to the Kikuyu Central Association, the association of the Kikuyu people. Background Jomo Kenyatta, 1966 The Kikuyu regarded FGM, which they called irua or circumcision, as an important rite of passage between childhood and adulthood. FGM consists largely of three procedures: removal of the clitoral glans (clitoridectomy or Type I); removal of the clitoral glans and inner labia (excision or Type II); and removal of all the external genitalia and the suturing of the wound (infibulation or Type III).\\"Female genital mutilation\\", World Health Organization, February 2013. The Kikuyu practised Type II and sometimes Type III.. Also see . Uncut Kikuyu women were outcasts, and the idea of abandoning the practice was unthinkable.Strayer, Robert; Murray, Jocelyn (1978). \\"The CMS and Female Circumcision\\", in Robert Strayer (ed.), The Making of Missionary Communities in East Africa, Heinemann Educational Books, p. 36ff. Jomo Kenyatta, who became Kenya's first prime minister in 1963, wrote in 1938: Campaign The campaign against FGM had been led since around 1906 by Dr. John Arthur of the Church of Scotland. In March 1928, the issue came to a head when the Kikuyu Central Association announced that it would contest elections to the Native Council, with the defence of Kikuyu culture, including FGM, as its main platform. The following month the church at Tumutumu announced that all baptised members must offer a declaration of loyalty by swearing their opposition to FGM. Several other church missions followed suit. Robert Strayer and Jocelyn Murray write that the stage was set for a major conflict, with neither side willing to compromise. In 1929 Marion Stevenson, a Scottish missionary, began referring to the procedures as the \\"sexual mutilation of women\\", rather than \\"female circumcision/initiation\\", and the Kenyan Missionary Council followed suit.Karanja, James (2009). The Missionary Movement in Colonial Kenya: The Foundation of Africa Inland Church. G√∂ttingen: Cuvillier Verlag, p. 93, n. 631. Hulda Stumpf, an American missionary who had taken a strong stand against FGM, was murdered in her home near the Africa Inland Mission station in Kijabe in January 1930. The Times reported that \\"[t]he medical evidence ... inclined to the view that certain unusual wounds were due to the deliberate mutilation such as might have been caused by the use of a knife employed by native in the form of tribal operation.\\"\\"Murdered Missionary in Kenya,\\" The Times, 18 February 1930. In November 1930, the Supreme Court in Nairobi, acquitting a man of Stumpf's murder, found no evidence that she had been killed because of the FGM campaign.\\"Murder of a Missionary in Kenya,\\" The Times, 27 November 1930. The issue of FGM was raised in the British House of Commons on 29 December 1930 by Katharine Stewart- Murray, Duchess of Atholl and Eleanor Rathbone. The Duchess of Atholl told the House: Rathbone asked that the words \\"or sex\\" be added to the motion before the House: \\"Native self-governing institutions should be fostered; and franchise and legal rights should be based upon the principle of equality for all without regard to race, colour, or sex.\\" See also *Women in Kenya *Mau Mau Uprising *Presbyterian Church of East Africa Notes References Further reading *Murray, Jocelyn (1976). \\"The Church Missionary Society and the 'Female Circumcision' Issue in Kenya, 1929‚Äì1932\\".

The first three issues of the magazine were co- edited by Steve Proposch and Chris A. Masters. Issues four to seven were edited-in-chief by Steve Proposch and co-edited by Chris A.

Writers who published stories in the magazine included Ramsey Campbell, Poppy Z. Brite, Robert Hood, Sean Williams, Richard Harland, Kyla Ward, Kaaron Warren and D.F. Lewis. Issue One contained an interview with Leigh Blackmore. Bill Congreve, Sean McMullen and Steve Paulsen's William Atheling Jr award-winning essay, \\"A History of Australian Horror\\", notes that \\"Issue 1 received some criticism for tending towards the splatter end of the genre...

The Implosion Publishing issues (Nos 8-11) were given UK distribution through BBR Distribution of Sheffield. In the US it was sold through heavy metal record shops and other outlets.

It is domiciled in the United States and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Quarto creates and sells illustrated books for adults and children, across 50 countries and in 40 languages through a variety of traditional and non-traditional channels. Quarto employs c.330 people in 8 offices in London, Brighton, New York City, Boston, Seattle, California and Hong Kong. The group was established by co-founders Laurence Orbach and Robert Morley and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1986. Laurence Orbach was Chairman and CEO until November 2012, when he was replaced as Chairman by Tim Chadwick and Marcus Leaver as CEO. Leaver resigned in May 2018 following a dispute with major shareholders Laurence Orbach and Chuk Kin Lau of the Lion Rock Group printing company, over the group's direction. Consequently, Chuk Kin Lau has been CEO of The Quarto Group since July 2018. History The Quarto Group was founded by Bob Morley, Michael Jackson and Laurence Orbach in the early 1970s and was finally established as The Quarto Group in 1976. In 1986, Quarto listed on the London stock exchange. By the late 1990s, Quarto had acquired three new imprints, Rotovision, Book Sales Inc and Rockport Publishers and founded Quarto Children's Books, Quintet and Quintessence that published art, health, lifestyle and children's books. The group expanded further in the US ‚Äì with the addition of Book Sales, Rockport Publishers, Walter Foster, Creative Publishing International, Motorbooks, and more recently, Cool Springs Press. In the UK, Quarto grew by acquiring Aurum Press and then Jacqui Small in 2004. By the 2000s, The Quarto Group had increased imprints and genres, along with this, a steady increase in its share value.[9] In August 2011, The Quarto Group acquired independent UK book publisher Frances Lincoln for ¬£4.5 million. In 2012, Marcus Leaver took over from Laurence Orbach as Group CEO and in the same year, the group made a profit of $11.4 million (¬£7.3 million) on revenue of $181 million (¬£116 million). Since then, the group has pursued a stated strategy of growing both organically and through judicious acquisitions, while constantly focusing on operational efficiencies. With increasing profit, 2013 saw a restructure of The Quarto Group by creating and renaming four distinct businesses: Quarto Publishing UK, Quarto Publishing US, Quarto Publishing International Co-editions and Books & Gifts Direct. By 2014, the group had started two new children's imprints: Wide Eyed Editions and words & pictures, and acquired small world creations[14] This helped the increase in share price by 60% since 2010. In 2015 Quarto acquired Ivy Press and Ivy Kids for ¬£1.5m and continued its expansion In 2016, Quarto acquired becker&mayer;, a co- edition publisher based in Bellevue, WA, for $9.8 million. In 2017, Quarto implemented a new organizational structure, moving away from geographic business divisions and encouraging imprints to be run as independent businesses with creative, commercial and financial oversight from the centre. The group has established a central platform that includes finance, operations, sales, marketing and foreign rights sales and that services all its imprints. That same year, Quarto sold its last two non-publishing businesses ‚Äì Books & Gifts Direct (Australia/New Zealand) and Regent Publishing Services (Hong Kong) ‚Äì and is now solely focused on its core publishing expertise.

It has had several organs since the first was installed in 1634 and multiple organists and assistant organists since the 16th century. Organs The first mention of an organ in the Abbey dates to 1634, but nothing is known of this instrument. The first properly recorded organ in Bath Abbey was built by Abraham Jordan in 1708. It was modified in 1718 and 1739 by Jordan's son. The specification recorded in 1800 was one of twenty stops spread over three manuals. The abbey's next organ was built in 1836 by John Smith of Bristol, to a specification of thirty stops over three manuals and pedals. This instrument was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North Transept by William Hill & Son of London in 1868, to a specification of forty stops spread over four manuals and pedals, although the Solo department, which would have brought the total to well over forty, was not completed. A new organ was supplied to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals. It was again rebuilt in 1930, and then by Hill, Norman and Beard in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58. In 1972 this was increased to a total of 65 speaking stops. The organ was totally reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, retaining the existing instrument as far as was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals. =Continuo organ= A four-stop continuo organ was built for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, contained in a case of dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440 Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415 Hz and A=486 Hz. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.

History Around the year 786 the abbot of the monastery of San Mart√≠n de Liebana, Santander, known as Beatus wrote a commentary on Revelation. From the tenth century, this work, was made into many copies or print miniatures, which were spread by Beatus in monasteries and cathedrals throughout the Middle Ages. Among these twenty codices, called \\"Beatus\\", which are still scattered around the world, one of the most beautiful and complete examples is the Urgell Beatus. It currently consists of seven pages numbered with Roman numerals and another 243 pages with Arabic numerals. It contains 79 illustrated miniatures. In the first third of the 20th century, it was studied by technicians as prestigious as HA Sanders, W Nieves and Mn.Pere Pujol, archivist of the Cathedral, all of which have tried to emphasize paleographic interest and artistic importance of the Codex and clarify any issues of bibliographic fact. Unlike other all existing Beatus, which are the appropriate authors' names, place of origin and the date of preparation, the Beatus we do not give any reference, making it virtually impossible to identify the calligraphers and miniaturist. Regarding the place and date much of the current specialists consider some coming from the monastery of La Rioja, towards the end of the 10th century. Regarding the Urgell Beatus, there are 12 illustrations included in the pages that make up the prelims, there are 67 references in the Commentary of the Apocalypse, and more than 11 illustrate the Commentary of Daniel . Add thus a total of 90 illustrations drawn medallions are on Genealogy. On 29 September 1996, two members of an organized gang of art thieves stole the Beatus after cutting the power and breaking the window of the museum. This group was caught in Valencia on 21 January 1997, among other works of art the police recovered the intact Beatus.https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/14/world/spain-dismayed-by-theft-of- priceless-medieval-book.html Cultural references * Sample images including stamp issued in 1975 by Spain's postal service corresponding to Beatus 72nd miniature.

Demographics  According to the 2006 census, 82.96 million disabled people live in China, an estimated 6.34% of the overall population. This statistic had a 1.44% increase from the year 1987. Men outnumber women in China‚Äôs 1.35 billion population making it no surprise that more than half of the people with disabilities are male. The number of disabled people living in the rural areas of China is 75% of the disabled population, compared to the urban which held 25% of the disabled population. Specifically relating to school-aged population, disabled children at the age between 6-14 reached to 2.46 million, 2.96% of the total disabled population. Less than 3% of China‚Äôs disabled population is in the school-aged demographic. Although this statistic is shockingly low, the one child policy contributes to much of the population decreases seen in recent history especially among school-aged children.\\"Facts on People with Disabilities in China.\\" (2006): 1+. International Labour Organization. The United Nations. Web. China categorizes disabilities differently than in other nations, for example China identified 5% of their school-aged population to be in need of special education whereas The United States identified 10% of their school-aged population; this comparison is a result of China not recognizing learning disabilities or disorders such as ADHD to be in need of special services whereas many other nations do.Deng, Meng, Kim Fong Poon-Mcbrayer, and Elizabeth B. Farnsworth (2001). The Development of Special Education in China: A Social Cultural Review. Page 288-298. Sage Journals. Web. Remedial and Special Education. Print. Educational opportunities for disabled Chinese are lacking, causing elevated poverty and poor living conditions . File:Education for disabled schooling age children new.jpg As the chart indicates approximately 60%-70% of disabled children are educated, contrasted with close to 100% for the able-bodied. Only 25% of disabled children enroll in high schools or higher educational institutions. File:Comparison education level for disabled people and normal peopel new.jpg Historical background Due to the views held regarding Confucianism, people with disabilities have been respected and considered part of society throughout Chinese history. Throughout Chinese history citizens with disabilities did not have high social status due to their physical or mental characteristics which limited their abilities to climb socially. Instead of viewing the minorities as equals, the Chinese people sympathized and pitied those with disabilities. Although there were many who wished to help disabled people, ‚Äúinstitutions for educating individuals with disabilities were not established during the feudal dynasties that lasted more than 2,000 years‚Äù(Deng, Meng, McBrayer, & Farnsworth 289). In the recent history of China, the most prominent influence in the beginning of special education was Mao Zedong. Improvement in the education system for children with disabilities was close to nothing until the twentieth century during Mao‚Äôs time of power. ‚ÄúUnder the Maoist philosophy, people with disabilities had been treated as equal members of society who could make contributions to the Socialist country. This promoted social awareness and acceptance of disability‚Äù (Deng, Meng, Mcbrayer, & Farnsworth 290). The most paramount change seen in this time period was in 1951, when the Chinese Political Council established The Decision to Reform the Education System, ‚Äúwhich explicitly required governments at all levels to establish schools for individuals with visual and hearing impairments and to provide education for children, adolescents, and adults with physical disabilities. This document, for the first time in Chinese education history, included special education in the formal public education system and advocated the legislation for special teacher education (Wang, Yan, and Mu 350). Results of this reformation led to ‚Äúthe number of schools and enrolled students with disabilities increas[ing] to 57 and 5,312, respectively, in 1955, and to 479 and 26,701, respectively, by 1960‚Äù (Deng, Meng, Mcbrayer, & Farnworth 290). However, these increases did not last long and were strongly affected by the Cultural Revolution in 1966. This occurrence had a negative effect on special education growth based on political and economic insufficiencies of that time. The newly formed special education schools under Mao‚Äôs rule suffered greatly ‚Äúwith many schools closing and the number of students falling from 1,176 before 1966 to 600 by 1976‚Äù (Deng, Meng, Mcbrayer, & Farnworth 291). Mao can be placed responsible for the increase of special education and ultimately the halt on special education practices in China. Services Few educational institutions serve special needs students. As of 2018, around 1710 institutions specifically serve disabled people, with forty-six thousand teaching staff spread across those institutions. In China, students with disabilities are usually separated from typical classrooms and placed in schools dedicated to special education. The first school dedicated to students with disabilities in China was established in 1987 in the city of Beijing. Currently this school has 60 staff members who teach more than 200 children in 17 classrooms. The school provides professional development and resource centers and an intensive diagnostic and training center for 3- and 4-year-olds with autism, as well as special education classes for school-age children\\". The school is described as being very academic however the students are involved in active activities and plenty of one on one time with their instructors. The school also recruits students from all around China due to the scarcity of special education schools across the country.Ellsworth, Nancy J., and Zhang Chung. \\"Progress And Challenges In China's Special Education Development: Observations, Reflections, And Recommendations.\\" Remedial & Special Education 28.1 (2007): 58-64.

It formed as a tropical depression formed well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula on July 16, and strengthened into a tropical storm within 24 hours. Located within a favorable environment, Estelle intensified into a hurricane on July 18. It attained major hurricane status (Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) two days later. After peaking in intensity at Category 4 strength, Estelle slowly weakened. By July 24, Estelle was no longer a hurricane while passing south of Hawaii. It completely dissipated on July 26 after further deteriorating to a tropical depression. The arrival of the hurricane prompted a hurricane watch for Hawaii, and 200 people evacuated from their homes. Hurricane Estelle produced high waves offshore Hawaii, causing $2 million in damage and two deaths. The remnants of the storm also produced intermittent showers across the state, though there was no major damage. Meteorological history Based on data from satellite imagery and weather reports from the cargo ships Hamburg Express and Aleksander Vermishev, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) upgraded a tropical disturbance into a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was located west of Clipperton Island, a small remote island in the Pacific Ocean, at 1200 UTC July 16. Moving towards the west beneath a high pressure area, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Estelle 12 hours after formation. Upon being named sea surface temperatures along the storm's path were , and thus Estelle began to rapidly intensify. The EPHC reported that Estelle had intensified a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on 1200 UTC July 17, 24 hours after first forming. Shortly after attaining hurricane intensity, an eye began to appear on weather satellite imagery. Based on this, the EPHC re-assessed the intensity of the system at 85 mph (135 km/h). Continuing to intensity, Hurricane Estelle became the first major hurricane of the 1986 Pacific hurricane season on 0000 UTC July 18. As its motion accelerated, Estelle peaked intensity at 135 mph (215 km/h). Moving west, Hurricane Estelle emerged into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility while still a major hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Estelle's forward motion increased to close to . As such, forecasters noted the path of a potential landfall on the Big Island. Due to a shearing environment from a trough, Estelle weakened as it continued to approach Hawaii. A possible re-curve towards the island never materialized, and the hurricane veered to west and passed south of the islands. Estelle weakened to a tropical storm on July 23 while passing south of Hawaii, and two days later it weakened to a depression. The tropical cyclone dissipated on July 27. Preparations, impact, and observation On July 22, the National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch and high-surf advisory for the Island of Hawaii as the storm was anticipated to produce life-threatening waves throughout the island chain. Gale warnings and small craft advisories were also issued. Hurricane Estelle was described by meteorologists as \\"small but dangerous\\". More than 200 people evacuated from their homes near the shoreline, but others refused to leave. However, the hurricane watch was dropped on July 24 when Estelle weakened to a tropical storm. Due to its rapid motion, Estelle kept pace with a large swell of water that it generated. In combination with a high spring tide and peripheral winds generated by Estelle, to waves crashed on the shores of the Big Island on the afternoon of July 22. Five homes were destroyed and another five sustained extreme damage. Twelve other homes received minor damage. Three beachfront divisions were destroyed. Dozens of other places in Vacation Land were also damaged. On Maui, waves washed away a dirt road on the eastern part of the island between Kipahulu and Kaupo. After Estelle passed by the islands, moisture related to the tropical cyclone caused heavy rainfall in the Ka'u and Puna districts on the Big Island. On July 22, a wind gust of was recorded near Kalapana Sand Beach. The total damage was around $2 million (1986 USD). Two drownings were reported on Oahu that occurred on July 23, due to rough surf caused by Estelle. Although isolated showers were initially recorded in the southern portion of the state, after Hurricane Estelle dissipated, its moisture became entrapped in a trough over the islands, causing significant rainfall and thunderstorms over the archipelago. Some areas in Hawaii received to . The rains in Hawaii had cleared up by July 29. Estelle was a well- observed storm, with Reconnaissance Aircraft flying into the hurricane to provide a fix on its location. It also passed near NOAA Buoy 51004 on July 22, providing valuable meteorological data for its future path.

The roast is ready as soon as the meat is easy to separate from the bone and the pork rind is crispy and golden brown. It is then served with various side dishes including gravy, Kartoffelkl√∂√üe, salad, sauerkraut, red cabbage and savoy cabbage. In Baden the meat is cured and smoked before it is simmered in a broth of water, white wine, vinegar, onion, bay laurel and clove for about two to two and a half hours. It is then served with potato salad, dressed with a broth of salt, pepper and vinegar.

This room is commonly known as a \\"bathroom\\" in American English, a \\"loo\\" in British English, a \\"washroom\\" in Canadian English, and by many other names across the English-speaking world. Names \\"Toilet\\" originally referred to personal grooming and came by metonymy to be used for the personal rooms used for bathing, dressing, and so on. It was then euphemistically used for the similarly private rooms used for urination and defecation. By metonymy, it then came to refer directly to the fixtures in such rooms... At present, the word refers primarily to such fixtures and using \\"toilet\\" to refer to the room or activity (\\"use the toilet\\") is somewhat blunt and may be considered indiscreet.. It is, however, a useful term since it is quickly understood by English-speakers across the world, whereas more polite terms vary by region. \\"Lavatory\\" (from the Latin ', \\"wash basin\\" or \\"washroom\\"). was common in the 19th century and is still broadly understood, although it is taken as quite formal in American English, and more often refers to public toilets in Britain. The contraction \\"lav\\". is commonly used in British English. In American English, the most common term for a private toilet is \\"bathroom\\", regardless of whether a bathtub or shower is present... In British English, \\"bathroom\\" is a common term but is typically reserved for private rooms primarily used for bathing; a room without a bathtub or shower is more often known as a \\"WC\\", an abbreviation for water closet,. or \\"loo\\".. Other terms are also used, some as part of a regional dialect. Some forms of jargon have their own terms for toilets, including \\"lavatory\\" on commercial airplanes, \\"head\\" on ships,. and \\"latrine\\" in military contexts.. Larger houses often have a secondary room with a toilet and sink for use by guests. These are typically known as \\"powder rooms\\" or \\"half baths\\" in North America,. and \\"cloakrooms\\" in Britain..  Other items in the room  The main item in the room is the sanitation fixture itself, the toilet. This may be the flushing sort, which is plumbed into a cistern (tank) operated by a ballcock (float valve). Or it may be a dry model, which does not need water. The toilet room may also include a plunger, a rubber or plastic tool mounted on a handle, which is used to remove blockages from the toilet drain. Toilets often have a wall mirror above the sink for grooming, checking one's appearance and/or makeup. Some toilets have a cupboard where cleaning supplies and personal hygiene products may be kept. If it is a flush toilet, then the room usually also includes a toilet brush for cleaning the bowl. Methods of anal cleansing vary between cultures. If the norm is to use paper, then typically the room will have a toilet roll holder, with the toilet paper hanging either next to or away from the wall. If instead, people are used to cleaning themselves with water, then the room may include a bidet shower (health faucet) or a bidet. Toilets such as the Washlet, popular in Japan, provide an automatic washing function. A sink (hand basin), with soap, is usually present in the room or immediately outside it, to ensure easy handwashing. Above the sink there may be a mirror, either mounted on the wall, or on a medicine cabinet. This cabinet (which is more typically located in the household's main bathroom) typically contains prescription and over the counter drugs, first aid supplies, and grooming equipment for shaving or makeup.  History  Into the modern era, humans typically practiced open defecation or employed latrines or outhouses over a pit toilet in rural areas and used chamber pots emptied into streets or drains in urban ones. The Indus Valley Civilization had particularly advanced sanitation, which included common use of private flush toilets. The ancient Greeks and Romans had public toilets and, in some cases, indoor plumbing connected to rudimentary sewer systems. The latrines of medieval monasteries were known as reredorters; in some cases, these were connected to sophisticated water systems that swept its effluent away without affecting the community's drinking, cooking, or washing water... In the early modern period, \\"night soil\\" from municipal outhouses became an important source of nitrates for creating gunpowder.. 19th century refinements of the outhouse included the privy midden and the pail closet. Indoor toilets were at first a luxury of the rich and only gradually spread to the lower classes. As late as the 1890s, building regulations in London did not require working- class housing to have indoor toilets; into the early 20th century, some English homes were built with an upstairs toilet for use by the owners and an outhouse for use by the servants.. In some cases, there was a transitional stage where toilets were built into the house but accessible only from the outside.As in plates 86 and 87 depicting homes in Leeds and Halifax, Muthesius, p. 121. After World War I, all new housing in London and its suburbs had indoor toilets. Bathrooms became standard later than toilets, but entered working-class houses at around the same time.Muthesius, pp. 61-62, 100, 137.. For plumbing reasons, flush toilets have usually been located in or near residences' bathrooms. (Both were initially located above the kitchen and scullery on the same account.) In upper-class homes, the first modern lavatories were washrooms with sinks located near the bedrooms; in lower-class homes, there was often only a collapsible tub for bathing. In Britain, there was long a prejudice against having the toilet located in the bathroom proper: in 1904, Hermann Muthesius noted that \\"a lavatory [i.e., toilet] is practically never found in an English bathroom; indeed it is considered downright inadmissible to have one there\\". When toilets were placed within bathrooms, the original reason was cost savings.. In 1876 Edward William Godwin, a progressive architect-designer, drew up affordable housing with the toilet in the bathroom, and faced criticism for it. America and most European countries now combine their toilets and bathrooms. Separate toilets remain common in British homes and remain a builder's option even in places where the norm is for the toilet to be in the bathroom.. In France,. . Japan,.. and some other countries,. separate toilets remain the norm for reasons of hygiene and privacy. In modern homes outside of France, such separate toilets typically contain a sink. In Japan, the toilet sometimes has a built-in sink (whose waste water is used for the next flush) to allow users to clean themselves immediately.. Japanese toilets also often provide special slippers‚Äîapart from those worn in the rest of the house‚Äîfor use within the toilet...  Society and culture  In English, all terms for toilets were originally euphemisms. It is generally considered coarse or even offensive to use such direct terms as \\"shitter\\",. although they are used in some areas. Formerly, broadcast censorship even banned mentions of the euphemisms: Jack Paar temporarily quit the Tonight Show in February 1960 when NBC broadcast news footage in place of a joke he had taped involving the term \\"WC\\".

Mahalia Jackson recorded the song on November 29, 1963 which was released by Columbia Records; Connie Francis recorded her own version on December 2, 1963,Ron Roberts: Connie Francis Discography 1955‚Äì1975, followed by its immediate release on MGM. The arrangement was provided by Claus Ogerman who also conducted the recording.Connie Francis: Souvenirs, Booklet of 4-CD- Box, Polydor 1996, Cat.-No. 314 533 382-2 Other artists to record the song included Kate Smith (for RCA Victor), Toni Arden (for Decca Records, Bobby Rydell, and Hettie Palance (for Palance Records). Of the various versions of \\"In the Summer of His Years,\\" only Francis' and Martin's recordings achieved enough sales action to chart on Billboard. Martin's single, released on the ABC-Paramount label, \\"Bubbled Under\\" the Hot 100 singles chart, peaking at No. 104, and Francis' version was nearly a Top 40 hit, peaking at No. 46. On the Cash Box magazine Top 100 chart, the sales of Francis' and Martin's singles were combined, and the song peaked at No. 31. However, no version of the song was granted a single release in the U.K., and in the United States, the song, even though recorded by major artists, was refused airplay by many major radio stations. An article in the December 14, 1963, issue of Billboard quoted station managers of several radio stations in New York and Chicago as saying they would not play the song because they felt it would be \\"in poor taste to capitalize on a such a tragic situation\\". Other station managers said they stopped playing the song after initially playing Millicent Martin's version because of apparent lack of listener interest or because they simply thought the song itself was of poor quality. All the proceeds of Francis' single and her subsequent album of the same name were donated to the family of J. D. Tippit, a policeman who was also fatally shot in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Francis' version of the song is considered one of the earliest charity records.

In 1926, the South African Railways placed four Class FD Modified Fairlie articulated steam locomotives with a 2-6-2+2-6-2 Double Prairie type wheel arrangement in service.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, December 1945. p. 968. Manufacturer The Class FD Modified Fairlie locomotive was designed and built for the South African Railways (SAR) by the North British Locomotive Company in 1925, to the specifications of Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR. Four locomotives were delivered in 1926, numbered in the range from 2320 to 2323. They were later renumbered in the range from 671 to 674.North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser Characteristics The Class FD was a heavier and more powerful version of the experimental Class FC which had been placed in service in 1925. It was the Modified Fairlie equivalent of the Class GD 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt which was similar in both size and mechanical respects, hence the Class FD designation of these Modified Fairlies. The FA and FB classifications were never used by the SAR. The Class FD locomotives had Walschaerts valve gear, plate frames and were superheated. They proved to be powerful locomotives and good steamers, but they were less successful than their Garratt equivalent. Shortcomings They suffered from the same shortcomings as their Class FC predecessor. The long rigid frame resulted in severe overhang on sharp curves and was also prone to metal fatigue and cracking, brought about by the long frame overhangs at the front and back beyond the engine unit pivot centres. The overhangs, laden with the water and coal bunkers of which about two-thirds of each extended beyond the respective pivot centres, tended to oscillate in an up-and-down motion while the locomotive was in motion. In addition to this rather serious defect, the pivot bearings were also subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a considerable additional load compared to those on the Garratt as a result of the water and coal bunkers which were mounted on the main frame instead of on the engine units. This resulted in increased frequency of maintenance and as a consequence, increased operating cost. Service The locomotives joined the sole Class FC in service on the Cape Midland System, working on the Grahamstown branch. They were scrapped by 1949. The long rigid underframe of one of the Class FD locomotives was used to construct a footbridge across the single track at Poet‚Äôs Corner Halt on the old Natal mainline between Pinetown and Rossburgh junction in Durban. The underframe forms the main girder of the footbridge.Soul of A Railway, System 6, Part 4: The Old Main Line from Rossburgh to Cato Ridge. Caption 22.

A full explanation of this figure and risks can be found in a 1999 report of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment which states that this image is specific to a laborer residing in the area between 1953-1959 (see page 18 of report). The Rocky Flats Plant is a former U.S. nuclear weapons production facility about northwest of Denver.U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Legacy Management, Rocky Flats Site, Colorado https://www.lm.doe.gov/Rocky_Flats/Sites.aspx Weapons production was halted after years of protests followed by a combined FBI and Environmental Protection Agency raid in 1989. The plant was shut down, and the buildings demolished and removed from the site. The Rocky Flats Plant was declared a Superfund cleanup site in 1989 and began its transformation in February 1992. Removal of the plant and surface contamination was completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The site achieved regulatory closure in 2006. Underground contamination was left in place, and low levels of measurable radioactive environmental contamination in and around Rocky Flats will probably persist for tens of thousands of years as the half-life of plutonium (specifically, Pu-239) is over 24,000 years. The Department of Energy continues post-closure monitoring and maintenance of the remedy in the Central Operable Unit, including three groundwater treatment systems. Historical releases caused radioactive (plutonium, americium) contamination within and outside its boundaries.U.S. Department of Energy, Rocky Flats Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study/Comprehensive Risk Assessment and Historical Release Report, https://www.lm.doe.gov/Rocky_Flats/Regulations.aspx#CAD The contamination primarily resulted from releases from the 903 pad drum storage area‚Äîwind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste‚Äîand two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released during the operational life of the plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and normal operational releases of plutonium particles too small to be filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant carried airborne contamination south and east into populated areas northwest of Denver. The Denver area's contamination by plutonium from the fires and other sources was not publicly reported until the 1970s. According to a 1972 study coauthored by Edward Martell, \\"In the more densely populated areas of Denver, the Pu contamination level in surface soils is several times fallout\\", and the plutonium contamination \\"just east of the Rocky Flats plant ranges up to hundreds of times that from nuclear tests.\\" As noted by Carl J. Johnson in Ambio, \\"Exposures of a large population in the Denver area to plutonium and other radionuclides in the exhaust plumes from the plant date back to 1953.\\" Offsite areas and the lands now comprising the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge were studied as part of the cleanup and were eventually judged by the U.S. government to be suitable for any use. The Refuge lands were not required to undergo remediation because contamination was limited to below ground level. Surface water sampling is ongoing and groundwater samples are regularly collected and analyzed. As of 2020, the ongoing effects of the radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant include the inability to complete the northwest quadrant of Denver's automotive beltway due to underground plutonium contamination of the area.https://www.outtherecolorado.com/news/discovery-of- high-plutonium-levels-causes-major-setback-in-denver-highway- project/article_378c9c3e-f074-55e1-99ea-82ecd74ae0a1.html Occasionally, news media report the discovery of higher-than-allowed plutonium levels.https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/20/rocky-flats-plutonium-jefferson- parkway/ Similarly, water runoff from floods has measurably displaced plutonium and americium such that limits are sometimes exceeded.https://www.boulderweekly.com/news/breach-of-trust/ Prescribed fires to control the buildup of prairie and forest underbrush have been precluded due to plutonium concerns.https://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/28/plutonium- fears-hex-planned-prescribed-fires-at-rocky-flats-wildlife-refuge/ Standley Lake remains in use as a public water supply while contaminated by trace amounts of plutonium and americium oxides in its sediment, as these compound elements are \\"highly insoluble\\" in water.

All buildings have since been demolished. The Rocky Flats Plant was south of Boulder, Colorado, and northwest of Denver. Originally under the Dow Chemical Company's management, it was transferred to Rockwell in 1975. It initially had an area of ; a buffer zone was added in 1972. Construction of the first buildings began on July 10, 1951. Production of parts for nuclear weapons began in 1953. At the time, the precise nature of the work at Rocky Flats was a closely guarded secret. The plant produced fission cores for nuclear weapons, used to \\"ignite\\" fusion and fissionable fuel. Fission cores resemble miniaturized versions of the Fat Man nuclear bomb detonated above Nagasaki. They are often called \\"triggers\\" in official and news documents to obfuscate their function. For much of its operational lifetime, Rocky Flats was the sole mass-producer of plutonium components for America's nuclear stockpile. Management of the site passed to EG&G; in 1990, which did not reapply for the contract in 1994. Management of the site passed to the Kaiser-Hill Company on July 1, 1995. The Department of Energy now manages the central portion of the site, where the production buildings once were, while the Fish and Wildlife Service has taken over management of the Peripheral Outer Unit.  Sources of contamination  Most of the radioactive contamination from Rocky Flats came from three sources: a catastrophic fire in 1957, leaking barrels in an outdoor storage area in 1964-68, and another, less severe fire in 1969. Plutonium, used to construct the weapons' fissile components, can spontaneously combust at room temperature in air. Additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate pondcrete vitrification attempts and routine releases during the plant's operation. =1957 fire= The glove box where the 1957 fire started. HEPA filter banks meant to remove microscopic particles of plutonium from the glove box exhaust streams were destroyed by the fire, allowing radioactive smoke to escape the building. On the evening of September 11, 1957, plutonium shavings in a glove box in building 771, the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility, spontaneously ignited (plutonium is pyrophoric). The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. It rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited a large bank of High- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles to escape from the building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended most of the plutonium release. Firefighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective. The 1957 fire released 11-36 Ci () of plutonium, much of which contaminated off-site areas as microscopic particles entrained in smoke from the fire. Isopleth diagrams from studies show parts of Denver in the area where surface sampling detected plutonium. That the fire had resulted in significant plutonium contamination of surrounding populated areas remained secret. News reports at the time reported, per the Atomic Energy Commission's briefing, that there was slight risk of light contamination and that no firefighters had been contaminated. No abnormal radioactivity was reported by the Colorado Public Health Service. =Pad 903 leakage= Corroded waste storage barrel at Pad 903. Plutonium milling operations produced large quantities of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium. Thousands of 55-gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen area called the 903 pad storage area, where they corroded and leaked radionuclides over years into the soil and water. An estimated 5,000 gallons of plutonium-contaminated oil leached into the soil between 1964 and 1967. Portions of this waste, mixed with dust that composed Pad 903, became airborne in the heavy winds of the Front Range and contaminated offsite areas to the south and east. Leaking storage barrels at Pad 903 released 1.4-15 Ci () of plutonium as airborne dust during the storage and subsequent attempts at cleanup. Much more remains interred under the Pad 903 area, which has been paved over with asphalt. =1969 fire= A room in building 776 damaged by the 1969 fire. Another major fire occurred on May 11, 1969, in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again from spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Firefighters again resorted to water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not built into the glove boxes. While the fire bore marked similarities to the 1957 fire, the level of contamination was less severe because the HEPA filters in the exhaust system did not burn through (after the 1957 fire, the filter material was changed from cellulose to nonflammable fiberglass). Had the filters failed or the roof (which sustained heavy fire damage) been breached, the release could have been more severe than the 1957 fire. About of plutonium was in the storage area where the fire occurred, and about total plutonium was in building 776/777. The 1969 fire released 13-62 mCi () of plutonium, about 1/1000th as much as was released in the 1957 fire. But the 1969 fire led local health officials to perform independent tests of the area surrounding Rocky Flats to determine the extent of the contamination. This resulted in the first releases of information to the public that populated areas southeast of Rocky Flats had been contaminated. =Other sources= Rockwell workers mixed hazardous and other wastes with concrete to create one-ton solid blocks called pondcrete. These were stored in the open under tarps on asphalt pads. The pondcrete turned out to be weak storage, an outcome Rockwell's engineers had predicted. Relatively unprotected from the elements, the blocks began to leak and sag. Nitrates, cadmium and low-level radioactive waste began to leach into the ground and run downhill toward Walnut Creek and Woman Creek. Most of the plutonium from Rocky Flats was oxidized plutonium, which does not readily dissolve in water. A large portion of the plutonium released into the creeks sank to the bottom and is now found in the streambeds of Walnut and Woman Creeks and on the bottom of local public reservoirs just outside Rocky Flats: Great Western Reservoir (no longer used for city of Broomfield drinking water consumption as of 1997 but still used for irrigation) and Standley Lake, a drinking water supply for the cities of Westminster, Thornton, Northglenn and some residents of Federal Heights. As one of several forms of remediation and once the extent of the lapses at Rocky Flats became public knowledge, several streams formed by drainage through the contaminated areas of the Rocky Flats Plant were diverted so that they would no longer flow directly into some of the local reservoirs, such as Mower Reservoir and Standley Lake. Also, a surface water control system was built to allow runoff from contaminated creeks to collect in holding ponds and thus reduce or prevent direct runoff into Standley Lake. Proposals to remove or breach some of these dams to reduce the cost of maintenance have been protested by the cities downstream. A 2005 report by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry described the presence of carbon tetrachloride at the Rocky Flats Plant. The report said that large amounts of carbon tetrachloride had been regularly released throughout the plant's operational years, releasing the toxicant into the air as a vapor. But the agency found that the concentration of carbon tetrachloride beyond the plant perimeter was less than the normal amounts of carbon tetrachloride normally found in suburban areas, and therefore below the levels associated with health effects.https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/RockyFlats(DOE)/RockyFlatsPHA051305a.pdf  Reporting of contamination  No radioactivity warning, advisement or cleanup was provided to the public in the 1957 fire, the worse of the two. At the time, AEC officials told the Denver Post that the fire \\"resulted in no spread of radioactive contamination of any consequence.\\"\\"Atomic Plant Fire Causes $50,000 Loss,\\" Denver Post, 12 September 1957. The public was not informed of substantial contamination from the 1957 fire until after the highly visible 1969 fire, when civilian monitoring teams confronted government officials with measurements made outside the plant of radioactive contamination suspected to be from the 1969 fire, which consumed hundreds of pounds of plutonium (850 kg). The 1969 fire raised public awareness of potential hazards the plant posed and led to years of increasing citizen protests and demands for plant closure. Releases from previous years had not been reported publicly before the fire; airborne-become-groundborne radioactive contamination extending well beyond the Rocky Flats plant was not publicly reported until the 1970s. Reprinted in Most contamination was centralized in the 385 acres where the 800 industrial buildings were.https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.Cleanup&id;=0800360#bkground In 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveyed tissues harvested from deer that lived at Rocky Flats for plutonium and other actinides. Isotopes of plutonium, americium, and uranium were detected, with the highest measured activity being 0.0125 pCi/g (2360 seconds per disintegration) for uranium-233 or uranium-234. The study found that the increased cancer risk to an individual who ate of Rocky Flats deer meat per year for 70 years was at most 1 in 210,000. This is near the conservative end of the EPA's acceptable risk range. In August 2019, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment observed mixed results during testing of the Rocky Flats area. The testing, completed by the Jefferson Parkway Public Highway Authority, observed one sample with a plutonium level of 264 picocuries per gram. For reference, the Rocky Flats cleanup standard is 50 picocuries per gram. A second sample registered just 1.5 picocuries of plutonium per gram.https://coloradosun.com/2019/08/20/rocky-flats-plutonium-levels-soil- denver/ As of October 2019, testing of the area was ongoing.https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/10/04/testing-for-plutonium- continues-at-rocky-flats-national-wildlife-refuge/ In February 2020, the parkway project was shut down and local civic authorities withdrew their support when plutonium samples with concentrations five times higher than the cleanup standard were found.https://www.outtherecolorado.com/news/discovery- of-high-plutonium-levels-causes-major-setback-in-denver-highway- project/article_378c9c3e-f074-55e1-99ea-82ecd74ae0a1.html  Contamination and health studies  Plutonium hexafluoride Plutonium-239 and 240 emit ionizing radiation in the form of alpha particles. Inhalation is the primary pathway by which plutonium enters the body, though plutonium can also enter the body through a wound. Once inhaled, plutonium increases the risk of lung cancer, liver cancer, bone cancer, and leukemia. Once absorbed into the body, the biological half life of plutonium is about 200 years. Beryllium bromide Beryllium is another chemical that affected employees of the Rocky Flats Plant. Employees were exposed by pathway of inhalation or contact with skin. It can be in dust, fume, mist or in solutions causing negative health effect of beryllium sensitization, chronic beryllium disease (CBD), and lung cancer. Beryllium sensitization is the activation of the body's immune response to beryllium. Beryllium sensitization is the first step towards CBD as a result from inhalation or skin exposure to beryllium dust, fume, mist, or solutions. A sensitized worker is at risk of developing CBD when inhalation exposure to beryllium has occurred. Chronic Beryllium Disease, CBD, is a chronic lung disease caused by inhaling airborne beryllium that occurs after being sensitized to beryllium. The common symptoms of CBD are shortness of breath, unexplained coughing, fatigue, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. There is varied progression seen in individuals with CBD. In some cases, after the first exposure to beryllium, some people may quickly develop signs and severe symptoms of the disease. Other people may not experience signs and symptoms until months or years after first exposure. Even if the worker is removed from the contaminated environment the symptoms can continue to worsen. Eventually, CBD can progress to a chronic obstructive lung disorder, which can decline mortality and a decrease in quality of life. Lastly, Lung cancer can occur from exposure to beryllium. Beryllium is considered a Group 1 carcinogen to humans.https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/beryllium/healtheffects.html Carbon tetrachloride When evaluating the contamination and health effects that have resulted from the Rocky Flats Superfund site it is important to consider the use of Carbon Tetrachloride. Between 1953 and 1989, Rocky Flats Plant routinely released large amounts of carbon tetrachloride into the air. This chemical was primarily used as a solvent for cleaning and degreasing on the plutonium processing line.https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/HM_sf-rocky-flats- smry-indings-hist-pub-exposure-studies-bklt-1999.pdf Workers at the Rocky Flats site were most often exposed to Carbon Tetrachloride via inhalation or oral ingestion. Short term exposures usually result in headaches, weakness, lethargy, nausea, and vomiting.https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/carbon- tetrachloride.pdf Exposure to large concentrations of Carbon Tetrachloride have been shown to damage the kidneys, liver, and central nervous system. Because the EPA has classified carbon tetrachloride as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen, it is crucial to evaluate the role of this dangerous chemical in regards to human health effects that have resulted from exposures at Rocky Flats. Not only were workers exposed to carbon tetrachloride, but individuals in the surrounding community have undoubtedly been exposed as well. This is because Carbon Tetrachloride has the capacity to remain in the air for several years before it is broken down into other chemicals.https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=194&tid;=35 Small amounts can also be found in surface waters, soil, and groundwater. Following the public 1969 fire, surveys were taken of the land outside the boundaries of Rocky Flats to quantify the amount of plutonium contamination. Researchers noted that plutonium contamination from the plant was present, but did not match the wind conditions of the 1969 fire. The 1957 fire and leaking barrels on Pad 903 have since been confirmed to be the main sources of plutonium contamination. Authors Krey and Hardy estimated the total quantity of plutonium contamination outside of Rocky Flats's boundaries to be 2.6 Ci (), while Poet and Martell estimated the value to be 6.6 Ci (). The study also noted that plutonium levels just outside the boundaries of the plant were hundreds of times higher than the background level caused by global fallout from nuclear testing, and that contamination to the north of the plant was probably caused by normal operations rather than accidental releases. From September 1947 to April 1969 there were 5 or more accidental surface water releases of tritium. Tritium, a radioactive element which was found in scrap material from Rocky Flats, was therefore directed into the Great Western Reservoir. This was uncovered in 1973 and following this, urine samples were taken from people living or working near Broomfield who could have drunk water from the reservoir. The findings of the samples showed that those who were exposed to contaminated water had tritium concentrations near seven times higher than normal (4,300 picocuries per liter versus 600 picocuries per liter). However, when the same group underwent urine sampling three years later, their tritium concentrations had returned to the standard. In a 1981 study by Dr. Carl Johnson, health director for Jefferson County, showed a 45 percent increase in congenital birth defects in Denver suburbs downwind of Rocky Flats compared to the rest of Colorado. Moreover, he found a 16% increase in cancer rates for those living closest to the plant as compared to those on the outer perimeter of the area, and he estimated 491 excess cancer cases whereas the DOE estimated one. A 1987 study by Crump and others did not find the cancer rates in the northwestern portion of Denver to be significantly higher than other parts of the city and attributed variance in cancer rates to the population density of urban areas. Crump's conclusions were contested by Johnson in a letter to the journal editor. In a 1992 survey of radiation risk analysis, the authors concluded, \\"Johnson failed to describe an effective and complete model for the cause of the cancers and its relationship to other knowledge as Crump et al. have done. Therefore, Crump et al.'s explanation must be preferred.\\" In 1983, Colorado University Medical School professor John C. Cobb and the EPA reported plutonium concentrations from about 500 persons who had died in Colorado. A comparison study was done of those who lived near Rocky Flats with those who lived far from this nuclear weapons production site. The ratio of Pu-240 to Pu-239 was \\"minutely lower\\" for persons who lived within 50 km of Rocky Flats, but was more strongly correlated to age, gender, and smoking habits than proximity to the plant.Cobb et al., \\"Plutonium Burdens in People Living Around the Rocky Flats Plant,\\" March 1983, EPA-600/4-82-069, Springfield, VA: National Technical Information Service In 1991, the Department of Energy's public affairs group published a pamphlet stating that the inhalation of sediments that become resuspended in the air is considered the most significant pathway that could expose human beings to plutonium from the contaminated local reservoirs, but also stated that the airborne plutonium concentrations as measured by downwind air monitors remained below the DOE standard. In a 1999 analysis, it was found that \\"the major event contributing the highest individual risk from plutonium released from Rocky Flats was the 1957 fire,\\" with wind distribution of plutonium from the 903 Pad Storage Area being the next greatest source of health risk. In this analysis, health risk estimates for off-site humans had a variance of four orders of magnitude, from \\"between 2.0 √ó 10‚àí4 (95th percentile) and 2.2 √ó 10‚àí8 (5th percentile), with a median risk estimate of 2.3 √ó 10‚àí6.\\" The DOE maintains a list of Rocky Flats epidemiological studies. In 1995, a report over 8,000 pages long was released by the Plutonium Working Group Report on Environmental, Safety and Health Vulnerabilities Associated with the Department's Plutonium Storage. This report listed Rocky Flats as having 5 of the 14 most vulnerable facilities based on plutonium environmental, safety, and health vulnerability at all Department Of Energy facilities. During the early 1990s, an independent Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw a series of reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.See CDPHE, Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies, https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/rocky-flats-historical-public-exposure- studies Voelz and colleagues found that exposure to external radiation cause six of the total eight causes of brain tumors occurred in workers and two occurred from plutonium exposure. The study consisted of 7,112 while male worker who were employed, between 1952 through 1979, at the Rocky Flats Factory. Total mortality was increase specifically with those who got brain cancer. Wilkinson et al. studied employees who worked at the factory between 1956 and 1980 and found higher mortality rates paired with leukemia, higher rates of plutonium in urine, and higher rates of radiation to the liver and brain.Voelz, G.L., Wilkinson, G.S., Acquavella, J.F., Tietjen, G.L., Brackbill, R.

Mortality Among Plutonium and Other Radiation Workers at a Plutonium Weapons Facility. American Journal of Epidemiology, 125(2), 231-250. Viet and colleagues did a case-control study, called Chronic Beryllium Disease and Beryllium Sensitization at the Rocky Flats: A Case Control Study. with employees of the Rocky Flats Plant to evaluate the risk of beryllium sensitization(BSENS) and chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The 124 individuals in the study worked in the plant from 1960 to 1988 and they all had different jobs, but were exposed to beryllium through inhalation and skin contact. Interestingly, the researchers found those with CBD had higher exposure estimates and more years of employment compared to those the control. Those with BSENS did not have significant differences with their control group. Viet and colleagues concluded if there is a decrease in exposure it could lessen the risk for CBD, but not BSENS.Viet, S. M., Rogers, J., & Torma- Krajewski, J. (2000). Chronic beryllium disease and beryllium sensitization at rocky flats: A case-control study. AIHAJ, 61(2). In 2003, Dr. James Ruttenber led a study on the health effects of plutonium. Conducted by the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the study concluded that lung cancer is linked to plutonium inhalation. \\"We have supporting evidence from other studies that, along with our findings, support the hypothesis that plutonium exposure causes lung cancer,\\" Ruttenber said. His group's findings were part of a broader study that tracked 16,303 people who worked at the Rocky Flats plant between 1952 and 1989. Their research also found that these workers were 2.5 times more likely to develop brain tumors than other people. Many findings linking workers and other cancer development are muddled due to the \\"strong healthy worker effect\\" (that workers tend to have lower overall death rates than general population because those that are ill or disabled are restricted from working). Also the standard mortality rates for cancers of stomach and rectum were found to be much higher than other studies of nuclear workers which indicates the necessity for further study since inhalation of plutonium can distribute to these areas. Many people who were employees of the Rocky Flats Plant talk about their struggles with chronic beryllium disease and issues they are dealing with today. They describe how the plant had them take minimum precautions to combat the toxic fumes, but it was never enough. So many of them have fallen ill and have to carry the effects with them for the rest of their lives.https://www.cpr.org/2018/05/15/as-rocky-flats-refuge-opening- nears-former-workers-opponents-still-harbor-doubts/ In February 2006, the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council was formed to address post-closure management of Rocky Flats. The council includes elected officials from nine municipal governments neighboring Rocky Flats and four skilled/experienced organizations and/or individuals. Information about the council is available on their website. In 2016, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced its Cancer Registry was preparing a follow up cancer study to its original 1998 report on cancer incidence in the vicinity of the former Rocky Flats Plant.Denver Post, http://www.denverpost.com/2016/12/02/rocky-flats- cancer-study/ The original report and 2016 report found no pattern of increased cancers in communities around Rocky Flats. In 2017, a follow-up cancer study was conducted by the Cancer Registry, which specifically found no pattern of increased thyroid or rare cancers in communities around Rocky Flats.  Legal actions  Subsequent to reports of environmental crimes being committed at Rocky Flats, the United States Department of Justice sponsored an FBI raid dubbed \\"Operation Desert Glow,\\" which began at 9 a.m. on June 6, 1989. The FBI entered the premises under the ruse of providing a terrorist threat briefing, and served its search warrant to Dominick Sanchini, Rockwell International's manager of Rocky Flats. The FBI raid led to the formation of Colorado's first special grand jury, the juried testimony of 110 witnesses, reviews of 2,000 exhibits and ultimately a 1992 plea agreement in which Rockwell admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines out of its own funds. This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by the GAO, and yet was also by far the highest hazardous-waste fine ever; four times larger than the previous record. Due to DOE indemnification of its contractors, without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and Rockwell the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers. While any criminal penalties allotted to Rockwell would not have been covered by U.S. taxpayers, Rockwell claimed that the Department of Energy had specifically exempted them from most environmental laws, including hazardous waste. As forewarned by the prosecuting U.S. Attorney, Ken Fimberg (later Ken Scott), the Department of Justice's stated findings and plea agreement with Rockwell were heavily contested by its own, 23-member special grand jury. Press leaks by both members of the DOJ and the grand jury occurred in violation of secrecy Rule 6(e) regarding Grand Jury information. The public contest led to U.S. Congressional oversight committee hearings chaired by Congressman Howard Wolpe, which issued subpoenas to DOJ principals despite several instances of the DOJ's refusal to comply. The hearings, whose findings include that the Justice Department had \\"bargained away the truth,\\" ultimately still did not fully reveal the special grand jury's report to the public, which remains sealed by the court. The special grand jury report was nonetheless leaked to Westword and excerpts published in its September 29, 1992 issue. According to its subsequent publications, the Rocky Flats special grand jury had compiled indictments charging three DOE officials and five Rockwell employees with environmental crimes. The grand jury also wrote a report, intended for the public's consumption per their charter, lambasting the conduct of DOE and Rocky Flats contractors for \\"engaging in a continuing campaign of distraction, deception and dishonesty\\" and noted that Rocky Flats, for many years, had discharged pollutants, hazardous materials and radioactive matter into nearby creeks and Broomfield's and Westminster's water supplies. The DOE itself, in a study released in December of the year prior to the FBI raid, called Rocky Flats' ground water the single greatest environmental hazard at any of its nuclear facilities. From the grand jury's report: \\"The DOE reached this conclusion because the groundwater contamination was so extensive, toxic, and migrating toward the drinking water supplies for the Cities of Broomfield and Westminster, Colorado.\\" A class action lawsuit, Cook v. Rockwell International Corp., was filed in January 1990 against Rockwell and Dow Chemical (due to the indemnity of nuclear contractors, the award would have been paid by the federal government). Sixteen years later, the plaintiffs were awarded $926 million in economic damages, punitive damages In May 2016, U.S. District Judge John L. Kane gave preliminary approval for a $375 million settlement against the Rockwell International Corp. and Dow Chemical Co. Nearly 26 years later, approximately 13,000 to 15,000 eligible property owners could receive monetary payments for damages and decreased property values. Property and homeowners who owned property on June 7, 1989, the day the FBI raided the plant, are eligible to file a claim for property devaluation. The deadline to file a claim was June 1, 2017. Rocky Flats site in 2011 Carl Johnson sued Jefferson County for unlawful termination, after he was forced to resign from his position as Director of the Jefferson County Health Department. He alleged that his termination was due to concerns by the board members that his reports of contamination would lower property values. The suit was settled out of court for $150,000. In May 2018, local activists sued the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, asking a federal court to stop the planned opening of Refuge access points. On August 9, 2018, the court denied the activists' motion, explaining that \\"plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to show that they will likely suffer irreparable harm.\\" In addition, the court later rejected activists' motion to add documents to the administrative record. The court observed that plaintiffs statements in support of this motion were \\"conclusory.\\" See Civil Action No. 18-cv-01017-PB. The activists had previously sued in 2017. The court dismissed this lawsuit and awarded costs to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. In September 2018, Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge opened to the public.U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, https://www.fws.gov/refuge/rocky_flats/  Legacy  Denver's automotive beltway does not include a component in the northwest sector, partly due to concerns over unremediated plutonium contamination. According to the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001, the land transferred from DOE to the US Fish and Wildlife Service was to be used as a wildlife refuge once Rocky Flats cleanup was complete. In order to help guide the future of Rocky Flats care and management, the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council was formed in 2006 after the US Congress, DOE and previous organization created the new council. The EPA's clean-up protocol divided the Rocky Flats Plant into two distinct areas, or operational units (OUs.) OU1 was 1,308 acres and included the center of the property where the majority of the industrial buildings were located. The other area was OU2, also called the buffer zone. It included 4,883-acre of peripheral space. The EPA focused its accelerated clean-up actions on OU1 because it contained the most contaminations. The actions included ‚Äúdecommissioning, decontamination, demolition, and removal of more than 800 structures; removal of more than 500,000 cubic meters of low-level radioactive waste; and remediation of more than 360 potentially contaminated environmental sites.‚Äù Once accelerated cleanup was complete, the EPA initiated long-term countermeasures such as ‚Äúinstitutional controls, physical controls, monitoring and signage.‚Äù There is still some residual contamination located at OU1, but studies show there is no health threat. Cleanup of Rocky Flats was finished in 2006 and verified by the EPA and CDPHE in 2007 after ten years and almost $7 billion. However, this was a \\"project that had originally been estimated by the DOE to take up to sixty-five years at a cost of $37 billion.\\"https://www.westword.com/news/rocky-flats-nuclear-weapon-colorado- plutonium-jefferson-county-mark-johnson-doom-with-view-11781634 Residual contamination below levels of regulatory concern remain. Plutonium 239, with a 24,000 year half life, will persist in the environment hundreds of thousands of years. Volatile organic compounds have a much shorter lifespan. Heavy metals will persist in perpetuity. In 2006, according to DOE, \\"The selected remedy/corrective action for the Peripheral OU is no action. The RI/FS report (RCRA Facility Investigation-Remedial Investigation/Corrective Measures Study- Feasibility Study) concludes that the Peripheral OU is already in a state protective of human health and the environment.\\" In 2007, the \\"Peripheral Operable Unit\\" (Peripheral OU) land area of Rocky Flats was transferred from DOE to FWS for use and preservation as the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge.U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, https://www.fws.gov/mountain- prairie/pressrel/07-46.htm During the environmental investigation and sampling, it had been determined that levels of residual contamination were so low, no remediation was required; the Refuge land was already in a state suitable for any use.Rocky Flats Corrective Action Decision/Record of Decision (2006), https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/rocky-flats-current-condition In 2017, a statutorily-required review confirmed the Refuge was suitable for any use, prior to its formal opening.Office of Legacy Management, U.S. Department of Energy, Fourth Five-year Review, https://www.lm.doe.gov/Rocky_Flats/Regulations.aspx In contrast, the DOE- retained \\"Central Operable Unit\\" of Rocky Flats remains under DOE control, and is subject to ongoing monitoring and sampling and groundwater treatment.Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Current Condition of Rocky Flats, https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/rocky-flats- current-condition Multiple assessments of Rocky Flats indicate that the long- term health risk to citizens living outside the boundaries of Rocky Flats is negligible, but citizen organizations feel that the remediation of the site was inadequate, despite the achievement of legal and regulatory requirements. An independent Public Health Assessment, completed by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), concluded that \\"the available sampling data, epidemiological studies, exposure investigations and other relevant reports paint a consistent picture of the public health implications of environmental contamination\\": \\"past, current and future exposures are below levels associated with adverse health effects.\\" U.S Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, \\"Public Health Assessment for Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, U.S. Department of Energy (May 13, 2005) ATSDR specifically considered children's health when evaluating exposures and their public health implications. Overall, ATSDR did not identify any environmental exposures at levels of public health concern for past and current exposures. Notably, past and current inhalation exposures to site-related air emissions presented no apparent public health hazard. In March 2006, the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council was formed to address post-closure management of Rocky Flats and provide a forum for public discussion. This organization was the successor organization to the Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments, which advocated for stakeholders during the site cleanup. The Council includes elected officials from nine municipal governments neighboring Rocky Flats and four skilled/experienced organizations and/or individuals. Information and Council meetings minutes and reports are available on its website. Members of the public are welcome to attend Council meetings and make public comments. In 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services proposed a controlled burn on 701 acres of the Wildlife Refuge. In 2015, they reported that they will postpone those burns until 2017. In 2015, there was a \\"soft opening\\" of the Rocky Flats Wildlife Refuge where small groups of people could reserve space on a three- mile guided nature walk. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge opened to the public on September 15, 2018.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, https://www.fws.gov/refuge/rocky_flats/ In 2015 Rocky Mountain Downwinders was founded to study health effects in people who lived east of the facility while it was operational. The group set up an online health survey conducted by Metropolitan State University of Denver. \\"Health survey of Rocky Flats neighbors to launch Tuesday\\" Denver Post. Retrieved November 9, 2016. Nicolas Hansen, a Denver litigation attorney, founded this group.Hansen Law Firm, https://www.coloradocontract.com/about- nick-hansen/ To date, no final survey report has been published by the Downwinders. In 2018, Metropolitan State University of Denver announced it would not to continue to participate in the health survey.  Public opposition and support  On the weekend of April 28, 1979, more than 15,000 people demonstrated against the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant. The protest was coordinated with other anti-nuclear demonstrations across the country. Daniel Ellsberg and Allen Ginsberg were among the 284 people who were arrested. The demonstration followed more than six months of continuous protests that included an attempted blockade of the railroad tracks leading to the site.Nonviolent Social Movements p. 295. Large pro-nuclear counter demonstrations were also staged that year. In 1983, the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center was founded with a goal of closing the Rocky Flats plant. \\"Peace and justice endures\\" Boulder Weekly. Retrieved November 9, 2016 The Center has since set goals of keeping the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge closed to the public, preventing construction of highways in or near the site of the former plant, and preventing new housing construction in the area. The Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation an, as of 2014, has one full-time employee. On October 15, 1983, about 10,000 demonstrators turned out for protest at the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant (well short of the 21,000 hoped for by protest organizers). No arrests were made. On August 10, 1987 (the 42nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki), 320 demonstrators were arrested after they tried to force a one-day shutdown of the plant. A similar protest with a turnout of about 3,500 was staged on August 6, 1989 (the anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima). A simultaneous protest rally was held at the Denver Capitol by Environmental Information Network (EIN), Inc to provide a safer place for people to go. It was simulcast on KOA Radio and KOA TV station by helicoptor. A reported 3,000 people showed up for the Capitol rally. Though public demonstrations against plant operations ceased with the decommissioning of the plant, activists continue to protest disposal of nuclear waste from the site and the scale and scope of cleanup operations. Since 2013, opposition has focused on the Candelas residential development located along the southern border of the former Plant site. With the establishment of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act in 2001, a 300 ft strip on the eastern edge of the refuge was allocated to Jefferson County for construction of the Jefferson County Parkway. In May 2008, the Jefferson Parkway Public Highway Authority was established to complete this last portion of the Denver metro beltway. Opponents of the parkway are concerned about the disruption of plutonium laden soil from excavation of the area to build the parkway. In April 2015, the WestConnect Corridor Coalition was formed with the hopes of bringing about the end of a decades long dispute to the completion of the Jefferson County Parkway. However, by October 2015, the WestConnect Corridor had withdrawn its support from the parkway, determining that the decision to build the parkway should be made outside of the coalition's process. As of 2019, Candelas, a large housing development in West Arvada on the south side of Rocky Flats Wildlife Refuge is being built and rented out. A group named Candelas Glows is opposed to a large housing and commercial development planned in the area, which the group calls a \\"plutonium dust bowl.\\" The Department of Energy responded by saying that studies show more risk from naturally occurring radioactive elements than from very small amounts of plutonium remaining around the former plant. Candelas Glows argued that a July 2015 radiation report from the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council shows plutonium levels at 1.02 pCi/L, compared to the regulatory standard of 0.15 pCi/L. While anti-Refuge activists have received the bulk of media attention, other community members support the Refuge opening and have found the cleanup records to be scientific.See Friends of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, http://rockyflatsneighbors.org/ A 2018 survey by Friends of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge also found that most area residents support the Refuge opening. To date, lawsuits by anti-Parkway and anti-Refuge groups have not succeeded in court. Regardless, the parkway project was halted after the February 2020 discovery of elevated plutonium levels by a Parkway Authority soil sampling program. Local civic authorities have withdrawn from the parkway project.https://www.outtherecolorado.com/news/discovery-of-high- plutonium-levels-causes-major-setback-in-denver-highway- project/article_378c9c3e-f074-55e1-99ea-82ecd74ae0a1.html Regarding a professional health assessment of the Rocky Flats Plant's ongoing impact on the local and surrounding area, and the Refuge specifically, Dr. Mark Johnson --no relation to Dr. Carl Johnson, but subsequently also Jefferson County's executive health director--states in the September 2020 book Doom With a View: Historical and Cultural Contexts of the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant: > ‚ÄúThe more time I spent conversing with politicians and contract managers > from Rocky Flats, and the more I learned about the nuclear and hazardous > waste pollution occurring around the plant, the more I came to question the > underlying narrative that this was fundamentally a patriotic enterprise > protecting America from its enemies.

Combining nature-documentary stylings with a competent narration from smooth-voiced John Hurt, Planet Dinosaur is sure to please budding paleontologists and older dinosaur fans alike.\\" References External links * *Planet Dinosaur Files * Category:2011 British television series debuts Category:2011 British television series endings Category:BBC television documentaries Category:Documentary television series about dinosaurs Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Planet Dinosaur"},{"id":"33053884","text":"Duke Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Altenburg (born 13 April 1600 in Torgau; died: 2 December 1632 outside Brzeg) was a member of the Ernestine branch of the House of Wettin and a titular Duke of Saxe-Altenburg and of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg.  Life  Johann Wilhelm was the second son of Duke Friedrich Wilhelm I of Saxe- Weimar (1562‚Äì1602) from his second marriage to Anna Maria (1575‚Äì1643), daughter of Philipp Ludwig, Count Palatine of Neuburg. After the death of his father Johann Wilhelm inherited the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg jointly with his brothers Johann Philipp, Friedrich and Friedrich Wilhelm II. Initially, the guardianship of the princes was taken up by the Elector of Saxony and their uncle John II. After John II died in 1605, the Elector was their sol guardian. After the War of the J√ºlich Succession, the brothers had been invested with J√ºlich, Cleves and Berg. However, they were only nominally Dukes and took the coat of arms. In 1612, the brothers went to the University of Leipzig to complete their education. In 1618, the eldest brother Johann Philipp came of age and began to rule independently. The younger brothers agreed that he would rule alone, in exchange for a financial compensation. Initially, the agreement was for a limited number of years. In 1624, however, it was extended indefinitely. Johann Wilhelm made his Grand Tour to Italy, Holland, France, England and Hungary together with his brother Frederick William. In the Thirty Years' War Johann Wilhelm served as a colonel in the Saxon army. In 1632, he died of a fever in an army camp outside Brzeg. He was buried in the St. Sophia Church in Dresden.

A native of Brockton, Massachusetts, Hasham spent seven years in the AAGPBL, pitching in 179 games while collecting a 3.15 career earned run average. She never once played for a pennant-winning team, which is one reason for her losing record of 58‚Äì88. Eventually, she played at outfield and was used in pinch-hitting duties to take advantage of her sturdy bat. Hasham debuted in 1948, but did not win a game while dividing her playing time between the Muskegon Lassies and the Peoria Redwings. She posted a solid 2.14 ERA in 63 innings pitched, though she finished with a 0‚Äì6 record in ten games. Hasham joined the South Bend Blue Sox in 1949, when she enjoyed her best career season. She earned the respect of Blue Sox manager Dave Bancroft, who included her in a pitching staff headed by Jean Faut, Ruth Williams, Lillian Faralla and Louise Arnold. Hasham collected a 12‚Äì8 record and a 2.02 ERA in 23 decisions, probably inspired by her pitching teammates and a strong offensive support from Elizabeth Mahon, Betty Whiting, Senaida Wirth, Betty Wagoner and Rita Briggs.

She improved in 1951, after going 13‚Äì15 with a 3.10 ERA. She pitched much better for the hapless Battle Creek Belles in 1952, leading her team with a 12‚Äì14 mark and a 2.51 ERA, while ranking third in the league for the most innings pitched (222) behind Racine Belles' Rose Gacioch (259) and Fort Wayne Daisies' Maxine Kline (238). She also contributed as a hitter, going 35-for-158 for a .222 average in 81 games, driving in 21 runs and scoring six times.

In 1953, Hasham had an 8‚Äì19 record with a .371 ERA for the last-place Muskegon Belles, who ended with a 39‚Äì70 mark, 39¬Ω games out of contention. For the second time she led the league in losses, but helped herself with the bat by hitting a .241 average (27-for-62) with one home run and 13 RBI in 62 games. Hasham was used sparingly by the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1954, during what turned out to be the AAGPBL final season.

Originally called the ‚ÄúAkron City Reservoir‚Äù, it was dedicated as the LaDue Reservoir on October 11, 1961, in honor of Wendell R. LaDue.\\"Dedication of LaDue Reservoir\\" The Geographic Names Information System recognized four variants names, including Akron City Reservoir, Bridge Creek Reservoir, Ladue Reservoir, and Wendell R. Ladue Reservoir. The reservoir is formed by the Bridge Creek Dam across Bridge Creek and the Black Brook Dike across Black Brook, both tributaries of the Cuyahoga River. The reservoir was created in an area that was covered with ice during the Wisconsinan glaciation and contains numerous glacial sand and gravel deposits (kames) and glacial ponds (kettles). The lake bottom retains the same irregularities found before it was dammed. Purpose The reservoir and surrounding land is owned by the City of Akron, Ohio and is operated by Akron's Watershed Division. The reservoir is one of three reservoirs that make up the City of Akron water supply, including LaDue Reservoir, East Branch Reservoir in Claridon Township, Geauga County, Ohio, and Lake Rockwell in Franklin Township, Portage County, Ohio. The main purposes of these reservoirs are to provide flood control to downstream areas, replenish the river‚Äôs flow during dry periods, and maintain an ample supply of available drinking water for Akron. Because Lake Rockwell is the main drinking water supply for the City of Akron, it is highly protected with no trespassing, fishing, or recreation permitted. However, both the East Branch Reservoir and the LaDue Reservoir are open to fishing, boating, and hunting. However, the Ohio Revised Code has special fishing regulations for LaDue Reservoir that do not allow gasoline motors on any watercraft, limit the size of electric motors, and restrict shoreline fishing to the right-of-ways along Ohio State Route 44, U.S. Route 422, and Auburn Road. Dams =Bridge Creek Dam= The Bridge Creek Dam , also known as the LaDue Dam, is a rolled earth fill with impervious core, maximum height 35 ft, top length 3200 ft, top width 40 ft, base width about 120 ft and length 4500 ft. Spillway: Uncontrolled concrete lined saddle spillway that is 200 ft at the top and 250 ft near at the base. The drop is about 30 ft. The Bridge Creek Dam is a restricted zone with ‚ÄúNo Trespassing Zone‚Äù signs on land and has marker buoys in the water. =Black Brook Dike and dam= The Black Brook Dike is 100 ft wide and nearly long. It is located at the southern tip of the reservoir near the intersection of Bartholomew Road and Ohio State Route 44. The Black Brook Dam is a rolled earth fill with impervious core, maximum height 20 ft, top length 325 ft, top width 30 ft, base width about 100 ft and length 1100 ft. It is located near the intersection of Crackel Road and Ohio State Route 44, about feet north of the Geauga-Portage County border. It uses a 6 ft concrete drainage ditch to evacuate water. The Black Brook Dike and Dam are restricted zones with ‚ÄúNo Trespassing Zone‚Äù signs posted on land and marker buoys in the water. Recreation The LaDue Reservoir wildlife area includes that protects the watershed of the east branch of the Cuyahoga River from the East Branch Reservoir at Headwaters Park in East Claridon, Ohio to Ohio State Route 82 in Mantua Township, Portage County, Ohio. For many years, the City of Akron managed recreation activities at its reservoirs. Since 2002, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Wildlife has managed the LaDue Public Hunting Area for the City of Akron, which includes hunting, trapping, boating, and fishing. The wildlife area includes diverse wildlife, including white-tailed deer, wild turkey, squirrel, rabbit, and woodchuck. Waterfowl include migrating mallards, wood duck, and Canada geese. LaDue Reservoir contains sport fish including walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, yellow perch, white and black crappie, and channel catfish. =Boating and fishing= Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1501:31-13 designates special fishing regulations for LaDue Reservoir that restrict watercraft to electric motors only and restrict shorelines fishing to the right-of-ways along Ohio State Route 44, U.S. Route 422, and Auburn Roads. Fishing in Ohio requires a valid Ohio Fishing License and is subject to Ohio fishing regulations. No gasoline engines can be used on LaDue Reservoir. ODNR Division of Wildlife maintains a gravel boat ramp with portable toilets near the intersection of East Washington Street and Valley Road. There is also an unimproved boat ramp at the south end of the reservoir where Ohio State Route 44 crosses the reservoir. Boats are limited to electric motors only. As of 2019, Breakaway Excursions began operating kayak and fishing boat rentals out of the La Due boathouse. =Hunting and trapping= Waterfowl hunting on LaDue Reservoir is limited to designated areas only and limited to hunters selected in an annual drawing held by the ODNR Division of Wildlife. Hunting in Ohio is subject to hunting regulations. Furbearer trapping is permitted throughout the area, however, it too requires a permit to trap beaver or river otter and is limited to trappers selected in an annual drawing by the Division of Wildlife. Trapping in Ohio is subject to trapping regulations. =Environmental conditions= In 2010, excessive heat contributed to concerns for harmful algal blooms in many inland lakes in NE Ohio, including LaDue Reservoir. A harmful algal bloom occurs when naturally occurring blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, produce neurotoxins, which affect the nervous system, and hepatotoxins, which affect the liver. It is now monitored by the Ohio Department of Health.

Launched in 2010, the series focused on Sarah Groundwater Law's engagement and wedding planning with bridesmaid and best friend, Aubrey Arnason. Since her marriage on June 28, 2011, the series looks at all types of matrimonial traditions and new ideas surrounding the multibillion-dollar industry. Each episode features a unique wedding idea for the viewer to pull inspiration from. The Wedding Belles is produced and filmed in and around Vancouver, British Columbia. Some episodes were filmed abroad; the London segment featuring the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton as well as the wedding of Groundwater Law filmed in Tuscany, Italy. Arnason & Groundwater Law produce the series which airs on Shaw Television via The Express. The show received its first Leo award in 2011 for Cinematography, awarded to Jon Fenster. The show also received two nominations: Best Lifestyle Series and Best Host(s) (of which Arnason and Groundwater Law were paired together).

The planet has an anomalously large radius that could not be explained by standard models at the time of its discovery, almost 1.7 times Jupiter's size while being 0.4 times Jupiter's mass. The planet was detected by the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA project searching for planets that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. The discovery paper was published on September 5, 2011. Discovery NASA's Kepler spacecraft continuously observes a region of the night sky, searching for signs of transiting planets. While orbiting their host stars, such transiting planets cross in front of host stars as seen from Earth. The slight and periodic dimming in the star's brightness is used to determine whether or not the dimming was caused by a planet and not by a false positive. Analysis of Kepler's early data yielded evidence of a transit signal around a star designated as KIC 11804465, later known as Kepler-12. The transit signal was designated KOI-20. The Keck Observatory collected observations to prove that Kepler-12b's signal was not actually caused by an eclipsing binary. The Kepler Follow-up Program (KFOP) worked to verify the existence of the planet. KFOP used the W.M. Keck Observatory's Keck I telescope to prove that Kepler-12 was not an eclipsing binary star (a possible false positive that mimics the transit signal). The WIYN Observatory, which was used for speckle imaging, supported Keck's findings and verified that the signal caused by KOI-20 was not caused by a nearby background star's interference. Adaptive optics imaging in the near-infrared was obtained on September 9, 2009 with the Palomar Observatory's PHARO camera on the Hale telescope confirmed both the WIYN and Keck findings. Keck's HIRES instrument measured Kepler-12's radial velocity, which was used to find more of Kepler-12's characteristics (and, by extension, deduce the characteristics of KOI-20 itself). The radial velocity measurements eventually led to the confirmation of Kepler-12b as a planet. Kepler's data in its first 1.5 years of operation was processed and analyzed, yielding Kepler-12b's radius, mass and density. The Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC infrared adaptive optics camera was used to carry out program #60028, which observed the occultations by several giant planets detected by Kepler behind their host stars. The Kepler team, using the observations, tentatively concluded that Kepler-12b most likely did not experience a temperature inversion, in which the day-side temperature of the planet is lower than the night-side. Kepler-12b's discovery paper was published in the Astrophysical Journal on September 5, 2011. Host star Kepler-12, known also as KIC 11804465 in the Kepler Input Catalog, is an early G-type to late F-type star. This corresponds strongly with a sunlike dwarf star nearing the end of the main sequence, and is about to become a red giant. Kepler-12 is located approximately 900 parsecs (2,950 light years) away from Earth. The star also has an apparent magnitude of 13.438, which means that it cannot be seen from Earth with the unaided eye. The star is slightly more massive, slightly more iron-rich and slightly hotter than the Sun. However, Kepler-12 is larger, with a radius of 1.483 times the Sun's radius. Characteristics Kepler-12b is a Hot Jupiter, and (at the time of its discovery) was the least-irradiated of four Hot Jupiters experiencing a radius anomaly of approximately 1.7 times or more the mass of Jupiter. This radius anomaly entails Hot Jupiters experiencing massive radius increases for a reason not explained by scientific models. Although Kepler-12 is the least- irradiated of the four Hot Jupiters, its radius is just as large, suggesting that multiple mechanisms influencing the planet's inflation are at work. Kepler-12b was compared to HD 209458 b in its discovery paper because both planets appear to release similar amounts of energy (flux); it was also compared to TrES-4b because of the similar radius of the planet. Kepler-12b has a mass of 0.431 Jupiters. Its radius of 1.695 Jupiter radii, however, indicates that the planet is almost 70% more than the size of Jupiter. With an orbit of 0.0556 AU, Kepler-12b's average orbit is approximately 5% the average distance between the Earth and Sun. The orbit lasts 4.4379637 days. Kepler-12b has an orbital inclination of 88.86¬∫, indicating that the planet is seen as nearly edge-on with respect to the Earth and to its host star. According to Kepler's official website, the mass and radius of the planet can be compared to 137 Earths (in mass) and 19 Earths (for its radius). The planet's density is 0.111 grams/cm3, about a tenth of the density of water, and its equilibrium temperature is 1481 K (some 5.8 times greater than Jupiter's equilibrium temperature). Additionally, Kepler-12b has an almost totally circular orbit, with an orbital eccentricity of less than 0.01. The planet is likely to be tidally locked to the parent star. In 2015, the planetary nightside temperature was estimated to be equal to 1711 K.A Comprehensive Study of Kepler Phase Curves and Secondary Eclipses:Temperatures and Albedos of Confirmed Kepler Giant Planets The brightest spot in the planetary atmosphere is shifted westward from the substellar point, indicating a strong winds.
