It is situated at the western foot of Jabal Bal'as and along the route connecting Palmyra (Tadmur) to the southeast with Salamiyah to the west. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), ‚Ä≤Uqayribat had a population of 2,745 in the 2004 census. History Uqayribat is identified as the site of the Roman- era town of Occaraba, listed on the Peutinger Table. In the Notitia Dignitatum, a Roman document, Occaraba is mentioned as a garrison of the equites promoti Illyriciani legion. The Czech explorer Alois Musil did not locate any Roman remains in the village during his early 20th-century expedition in the region. According to the 9th-century Persian geographer, Ibn Khordazbeh, during the Abbasid era, Uqayribat was one of the administrative subdistricts of Homs, along with al-Qastal, Salamiyah and Zumayn, all of which were part of the larger district of Jund Hims. It remained an administrative subdistrict of Homs by the 13th century as well. In 1900, the modern-day village of Uqayribat was founded by a group of farmers who migrated 100 kilometers northwest from their hometown of Palmyra to cultivate and settle the place. The settlement was built on a small elevation. The Ottomans, who ruled Syria between 1517 and 1917, established a gendarme post at the new settlement. Uqayribat soon after became the center of the surrounding region, which too was developing agriculturally and which was increasingly settled by formerly nomadic Bedouin tribesmen throughout the early 20th century. In 1908, Musil noted that the village and its agriculturally productive vicinity belonged to the Arab sheikh of Palmyra. During the Syrian Civil War, ISIS captured the town from the Syrian Armed Forces in 2014. On 3 September 2017 the town was regained by the Syrian Arab Army. However, on 9 September 2017, the army lost large parts of the town.ÿ®ÿπÿØ 6 ÿ£ŸäÿßŸÖ ŸÖŸÜ ÿ™ÿ´ÿ®Ÿäÿ™ ÿ≥Ÿäÿ∑ÿ±ÿ™Ÿáÿß ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÖÿπŸÇŸÑ ÿ™ŸÜÿ∏ŸäŸÖ ‚ÄúÿßŸÑÿØŸàŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸäÿ©‚Äù ŸÅŸä ÿ≠ŸÖÿßÿ©, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 9 September 2017.

The standard was initially proposed in June 2012 specifically for use with JSON and has since become available in two variations, JSON and XML. The two associated MIME types are media type: application/hal+xml and media type: application/hal+json. HAL was created to be simple to use and easily applicable across different domains by avoiding the need to impose any requirements on how the project be structured. Maintaining this minimal impact approach, HAL has enabled developers to create general-purpose libraries which can be easily incorporated on any API that uses HAL. APIs that adopt HAL simplify the use of open source libraries and make it possible to interact with the API using JSON or XML. The alternative would be having to develop a proprietary format which in turn forces developers to learn how to use yet another foreign format.  Convention  HAL is structured in such a way as to represent elements based on two concepts: Resources and Links. Resources consist of URI links, embedded resources, your standard data (be it JSON or XML), and non URI links. Links have a target URI, as well as the name of the link (referred to as 'rel'), as well as optional properties designed to be mindful of deprecation and content negotiation.

From that initial meeting with 41 participants, the congregation grew to a self-sustaining kehillah of approximately 250 families. Our rabbis have included Rabbi Ehud Bandel, Rabbi Adam Stein, and our current rabbi, Rabbi Yonatan Sadoff. The congregation originally met at rented facilities at the Kadimah Jewish Cultural Centre in Elsternwick and at B'nai B'rith House in Balaclava. In July 2013, the congregation moved into its own building on Hawthorn Road in Caulfield North; foundation members Miriam Faine and Greg Shalit purchased and donated a parcel of land for the purpose. Services are traditional egalitarian and are led by members of the congregation. Friday night services are musical with much singing.

Early life and education Jensen was born on July 4, 1934, in Fremont, Nebraska. He earned his B.A. cum laude in philosophy from Dana College in 1956. Jensen attended college with future U.S. Senator from Illinois Paul Simon and was lifelong friends with Simon. Jensen later earned his B.D. from Wartburg Theological Seminary in 1959, his S.T.M. from Chicago Theological Seminary in 1962. Jensen began doctorate work at Princeton Theological Seminary under Gerhard von Rad, but departed before completion to take a professorship in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Jensen later completed his Ph.D. from Aquinas Institute of Theology in 1972. Academic career Jensen studied in Chicago and wrote his S.T.M.,The Covenant in The Deuteronomic and Priestly Traditions under Robert J. Marshall. Jensen left Chicago in 1960 to study under Gerhard von Rad and Otto Piper at Princeton Theological Seminary. Jensen left his doctorate program after a year to become a professor and co-found the Mekana Yesus Seminary in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1962. Jensen returned to the United States in 1965 to teach at his alma mater Dana College. He returned to Wartburg Theological Seminary to teach from 1972‚Äì1981. He briefly taught at Luther Seminary before leaving academia in 1982 to host the television and radio program, Lutheran Vespers. In 1997, Jensen was invited to become the first Axel Jacob and Gerde Maria Carlson Professor of Homiletics at Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, a post he held until his retirement in 2002. Richard A. Jensen was also the Dean of the Doctorate of Ministry program sponsored by the Association of Chicago Theological Seminaries in the late 1980s. In 1986, Jensen along with his wife Bonnie, assisted with merging the American Lutheran Church and Lutheran Church in America into the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. =Contributions to theology= Jensen at Dana College in 2003. In the late 1960s the charismatic movement was causing a controversies in the Lutheran church. Jensen had become a leading scholar on the application of a Lutheran theological understanding of neo-Pentecostalism. Jensen wrote his first book in 1974, Touched by the Spirit, developing a Lutheran perspective on his personal experiences, and attempting to embrace the charismatic movement rather than condemn it.ftp://210.102.253.7/image01/ii100039.pdfhttp://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/162031/2012_biniel%20mallyo.pdf?sequence=1 Jensen's research was met some skepticism, but ultimately received positive reception from parish pastors, theologians, and college professors. Although, Jensen's Ph.D was in systematic theology, he developed a story-based preaching technique that emphasized preaching as an oral art of communication rather than written discourse memorized or read to listeners. In 1993, Jensen published Thinking in Story. This was followed by three books that understood the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke as oral narratives from which the preacher used Biblical narrative to enable the listener to participate more holistically in the stories of Jesus. Jensen further expanded his understanding of preaching to incorporate the use of art and visual images in the sermon and worship experience. This thinking culminated in the book published in 2005, Envisioning the Word: The Use of Visual Images in Preaching. Personal life Richard Jensen was married to Bonnie L. Jensen, ELCA Global Mission executive director (retired), they had three children: Doron, Dodi, and Derek. Jensen was also a relative of Moritz Thomsen. A scholar of ancient texts, he could read and write in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. On November 19, 2014, he died at the age of 80. While in Ethiopia, Jensen and his wife served with fellow Lutheran missionaries Irvin and Jerene Mortenson family, parents of Greg Mortenson. While in Ethiopia they became friends with Luther Youngdahl and the Youngdahl family. Richard Jensen along with his wife Bonnie, received honorary doctorates from Dana College.

The Western Corridor NRL bid was launched on 14 August 2010. The bid is headquartered in Ipswich, Queensland and is closely associated with the Ipswich Jets. The bid promotes the benefits of having a third South-East Queensland club to boost television ratings, attendances and promote the code in a \\"heartland\\" area. History and bid region Rugby league football has been played in Brisbane and Ipswich for over a century and is currently represented in the Queensland Cup by the Ipswich Jets. In 2009, before the bid was launched, Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale invited then NRL CEO David Gallop to tour the region. Gallop stressed the importance of establishing an NRL side in the \\"Ipswich-Logan corridor\\" and was famously quoted as saying the NRL should expand \\"where the fish are biting\\". The club's heartland region will encompass Ipswich, Logan and Toowoomba while also supporting South West Queensland. Club identity The local Intrust Super Cup team The Ipswich Jets would most likely be promoted into the National Rugby League. Headquarters and stadium It is envisioned that the club will base itself out of Springfield, this location was selected as it is geographically roughly halfway between Ipswich and Logan and is serviced by the Springfield railway line. The club will initially use the existing training facilities at Brothers Ipswich RLFC in Ipswich while the permanent state-funded training and administration facilities are built in Springfield. South East Queensland's largest stadium is Lang Park and is home to NRL club the Brisbane Broncos. The bid has proposed that it initially play out of Lang Park while it waits for a permanent stadium to be built in the Ripley Valley or in Springfield A planned upgrade to Ipswich Jets home ground North Ipswich Reserve, which would turn it into a boutique stadium with a capacity of at least 20,000, has also been suggested as a possible stadium to host an NRL team as well as a proposed Ipswich A-League team. Community The club will be based on the not-for- profit, community-owned model of the Green Bay Packers in the NFL The bid has also planned the development of feeder teams in the Queensland Cup, such as reviving the Toowoomba Clydesdales or promoting the Western Mustangs into the Intrust Super Cup, in order to provide direct pathways for players to progress into the NRL team. In 2012 University of Queensland partnered with the bid in an effort to further provide more educational pathways for youth in the region and to also further target Indigenous youth. Bid support During the 2010 Annual CEO conference the Western Corridor bid and the West Coast Pirates bid were seen as preferable expansion locations. The bid is also supported by Ipswich Mayor Anthony Antonelli and the City of Ipswich. It is also backed by Brothers Ipswich, despite the launch of a Brothers Confraternity NRL bid. Many rugby league personalities, such as Johnathan Thurston and Sam Thaiday have also publicly supported the bid.

As a 23 year old consular secretary he became Norway's only diplomatic representative to the great power of Austria-Hungary in 1905 and in charge of obtaining diplomatic recognition of Norway following the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden; he later served as consul and acting consul-general in Vienna. Paus left Austria-Hungary in 1918 and later became a businessman in Norway, an estate owner in Sweden, where he owned Kvesarum Castle, and finally moved to Copenhagen.\\"Paus, Thorleif,\\" in Vem √§r Vem? ; Sk√•ne [Who's Who; Scania], 1948, p. 440Alf Petersen, \\"Paus, Thorleif,\\" in Den norske h√¶rs vernepliktige officerer : 1864‚Äì1933, Hanche, 1936, p. 447 Background and family A member of the Paus family, he was a son of the steel industrialist and banker Ole Paus and Birgitte Halvordine Schou, and grew up in Christiania (now Oslo). His father was a first cousin of Henrik Ibsen, whereas his mother was a first cousin of the industrialist Halvor Schou. Prime Minister Sigurd Ibsen was Thorleif Paus' second cousin. He was the brother of the businessman Christopher Blom Paus (1878‚Äì1959) and the brother-in-law of the historian of nobility Otto von Munthe af Morgenstierne. His nephew was the steel industrialist Per Paus, who was married to Hedevig Wedel-Jarlsberg. In his first marriage, he was married to Ella Stein (1883‚Äì1971), who belonged to a bourgeois Viennese family of Jewish origin. In his second marriage, he was married to the former countess Ella Moltke, n√©e Gl√ºckstadt (born 1899 in Copenhagen), a daughter of the prominent Danish Jewish businessman Valdemar Gl√ºckstadt and widow of count Erik Moltke of N√∏r. In his first marriage, he was the father of Helvig Paus (born 1909 in Vienna) and Major-General Ole Paus (born 1910 in Vienna). In his second marriage, he had a stepson, count Erik Moltke. He was the grandfather of the troubadour Ole Paus and the great-grandfather of the composer Marcus Paus. Career He graduated from the Norwegian Military Academy and became a second lieutenant in the cavalry in 1902; he was promoted to first lieutenant in 1909. From 1902 he served as a consular secretary (deputy head of mission) at the Swedish- Norwegian consulate general in Vienna. The industrialist Carl Neufeldt was honorary consul-general, but usually absent, and in practice the consulate- general was led by Paus. Following the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden the consulate-general in practice became the Norwegian diplomatic mission to Austria-Hungary, and Paus was tasked with obtaining diplomatic recognition of Norway as Norway's only representative in the country. At the time Paus was 23 years old and officially employed as a consular secretary. The Austrian newspaper Die Zeit noted that \\"Lieutenant Thorleif v. Paus manages the consulate's business. Rarely has a young diplomat found himself in such a responsible position as Mr. v. Paus, who will in a short time have to obtain recognition of his country from the Vienna government.\\"\\"Die Vertretung Schweden-Norwegens in Wien,\\" Die Zeit, 10 June 1905, p. 3 The newspaper expected him to become head of a new legation, but Norway chose to appoint Thor von Ditten as minister to Berlin with secondary accreditations to multiple countries including Italy and Austria-Hungary from 1906. Paus later served as commercial attach√© and from 1910 to 1917 formally as vice consul and oftentimes acting consul-general. As such he was the highest-ranking representative of Norway residing in Austria-Hungary. From 1906 to 1918, Paus operated his own business as an agent in Vienna, representing large Norwegian industrial companies, mainly Norsk Hydro, in Austria-Hungary. As consul he became the only Scandinavian to witness the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo in 1914. Kvesarum Castle He returned to Norway in 1918 and continued his business as Thorleif Paus A/S in Oslo. He also became the owner of two factories in √Ölesund. He lived in Scania, Sweden from 1935 to 1964, where he owned Kvesarum Castle from 1936 and the large estate Ejratal from 1948. He also inherited the manor house Magle√•s outside Copenhagen from his relative, count Christopher (de) Paus in 1943, but sold the property to the Catholic Church in Denmark a few years later. During the Second World War he received many Norwegian refugees at his castle Kvesarum, and there was built a Norwegian refugee camp near the castle. He moved to Copenhagen in 1964.\\"90 √•r: Tidligere konsul i Wien, Thorleif Paus,\\" Aftenposten, 8 October 1971, p. 10Palle Koster Jacobsen: \\"Han s√• erkehertugen d√∏ ...,\\" F√¶drelandsvennen, 14 December 1968, p. 4 In Austria-Hungary, his name was usually and officially spelled Thorleif von Paus (commonly abbreviated to v.

Mitteilungen der Kaiserlich-K√∂niglichen Geographischen Gesellschaft, vol. 52 p. 615, 1909, and vol. 59, 1916, p. 310 The spelling von Paus was regarded as a rendering of the name in a German/Austro-Hungarian linguistic and cultural context, and not a native form of the name, which he continued to spell simply as Thorleif Paus within Scandinavia. In Austria-Hungary, he received the Order of the Iron Crown, one of the country's highest orders and which previously conferred automatic ennoblement.

Formerly a member of Sound Team, Baird began performing solo in 2006, first as {} and later under his own name. He appeared in the 2010 documentary Echotone, a chronicle of the Austin, Texas music scene, where he offered a negative assessment of his time signed to a major record label. He wrote an article along those lines for Impose Magazine, which turned into several more articles about the music industry.  Performances and records  Baird first achieved success as the frontman for Sound Team (2001‚Äì2007), which was signed to Capitol Records in 2005 but dropped from the label after the commercial failure of their album Movie Monster. In 2006, Baird left Sound Team and began performing as {}, as well as under his own name. In late 2006, he self- released two cd-rs {} and Silence!, with the Paris Translantic calling the latter \\"strikingly personal and quite beautiful.\\" NPR called {} \\"....beautifully lo-fi... a bare and innocent album that sounds as though a friend were strumming songs just for you in his living room.\\" For live performances, he adopted the Sunset moniker from the aforementioned album title. In 2008, Sunset released three full-length records to positive reviews, with Exclaim! writing: > Every so often there comes a record that stops you dead in your tracks, one > that makes you sit up, take notice and soak in each and every note. Bright > Blue Dream by {} is such a record. Gorilla vs. Bear described Bright Blue Dream as \\"dense and adventurous\\" and compared it favorably to the work of Syd Barrett, Brian Eno and Ennio Morricone. He played at the South by Southwest music festival as Sunset in 2008, with subsequent appearances in 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015. As {}, Bill Baird recorded the song 'Fishtown' at Miner Street Recordings in Philadelphia with Producer and Engineer Brian McTear and Producer Quentin Stoltzfus for Volume 0 Episode 1 of Weathervane Music's documentary video series Shaking Through. In 2009, Baird was hired as a recurring national-anthem singer for the Richmond Flying Squirrels, a AA baseball team, and received side work dressing up as the team's Flying Squirrel mascot at community outreach events. Based on positive reception to his performances, he travelled with them on the road for part of the season. As a thank you for his efforts, the team signed him to a one-day player contract on Aug. 14, 2009, and subbed him in as a second baseman in the sixth inning of a game against the Bowie Baysox. Baird batted 1-for-2 with an RBI triple. His earnings from the Flying Squirrels paid for his next two self-released records and funded his fall 2010 European tour. These subsequent two self-released records, Career and Goodbye Vibrations, received critical praise, with Tiny Mix Tapes declaring \\"Bill Baird is one of the last rock n roll geniuses\\" and The Big Takeover calling Goodbye Vibrations \\"powerful.\\" In late 2010, he published a zine, \\"How Songwriting Ruined My Life,\\" which led to songwriting workshops at the Esalen Institute as well as several Austin, TX high schools. In 2011, Baird performed his final show as Sunset at the inaugural Gorilla vs. Bear Fest. In 2013, Baird moved from Austin, Texas to Oakland, California to become a teaching assistant while pursuing an MFA in electronic music at Mills College; there, he released the album Spring Break of the Soul. Spring Break of the Soul was originally written as a musical but has not been performed. The vinyl packaging includes a copy of the script written for the musical. He described its album and its creation in a wide-ranging 2013 interview with Tiny Mix Tapes. After its release, Baird was named \\"Best Newly Arrived East Bay Musician\\" by East Bay Express. In 2014, he performed at the Phono Del Sol music festival in San Francisco. Later that year, he released Diamond Eyepatch to positive reviews, with Popmatters claiming \\"he transcends genres even as he reinvents them.\\" Upon finishing his time at Mills College, he was awarded the Frog Peak Collective Experimental Music Prize. In 2016, he released the UK only 2XLP Earth into Aether, a selection of tracks from his self-released records, which The Guardian called \\"a lovely, warm, witty psychedelic journey\\" in a 4-star review. More positive reviews followed as well as live performances on several BBC programs. The album was Rough Trade album of the month and subsequently named one of its 100 best albums of the year. AllMusic gave the album 4 stars, saying \\"Earth into Aether is an opportune entrance point for those new to the artist, doubling as a well-curated playlist for established fans.\\" He subsequently released Summer is Gone, an orchestral album largely tracked live at Abbey Road Studios and ISSUE Project Room. In addition to standard release formats, the album featured a website, www.summerisgone.live, which created a unique track listing for each visitor. The interactive website was designed and programmed by Peter Browse and Caleb Al-Jorani of One Pixel Wide. The album won praise for its music, with the Financial Times describing the album as \\"engaging\\" in its 4-star review, stating, \\"Any album about the passing of time sets itself a stern challenge in justifying its claim on our time: Summer Is Gone passes the test.\\" In 2017, he released two more UK-only records, Easy Machines and Baby Blue Abyss, on the same day to positive critical response, with Classic Rock Magazine calling it in a 4-star review \\"the most focused, challenging singer-songwriter record in some years.\\" The albums also earned 4-star reviews from Mojo, Uncut, Q, and Record Collector, with Record Collector writing, \\"Whichever one you‚Äôre listening to will be your favourite, but the fact there‚Äôs a contrasting-but-similar experience to turn to as one ends makes the experience hugely enjoyable. Why can‚Äôt more artists work like this?\\" In 2017, he penned article for Rough Trade on the alternative local history of the East Bay.  Notable appearances / installations  In 2006, Baird gained notoriety by mocking the music review site Pitchfork Media, recording himself taking a pitchfork to a dummy branded with his band's name and uploading the video to YouTube. In 2010, he appeared in Echotone, a documentary about the commercialization of the music scene in Austin, Texas. In the film, he recounted his negative experiences with being signed to a major record label. The film was a New York Times critic's pick and described Baird as \\"thoughtful.\\" The Village Voice wrote of the film, \\"The ghostly ambassador...is Bill Baird, the magnetically awkward experimental rocker who emerged from a label deal gone wrong with a new band and a few rungs under his eyes.\\" The city of Austin, TX declared August 4, 2011 \\"Bill Baird Day\\" in honor of his music and place in the community. Baird participated in the annual San Francisco Music Video Race competition in July 2014. The music video for his song \\"Soggy Soul,\\" directed by Dan Lichtenberg of \\"Slow Clap Productions,\\" was the runner up in the competition and also won \\"Best Concept\\" and \\"Best Use of Song Provided.\\" In 2016, he recorded a segment for NPR about Lake Merritt.  Creative Technology  In 2014, Baird was named artist-in- residence with the Paul Dresher Ensemble. While in residence, he finished the Magnetetractys, an invented instrument utilizing 9 strings and gloves embedded with magnetic coils. The instrument premiered in Impose Magazine, who wrote: > Bill‚Äôs body of work is confounding, intriguing, unique and thoughtful, > sliding around on the slippery surface of psych-pop from folk intimacy to > ambient suspense; we‚Äôre interested to see what dimensions the Magnetetractys > will add to his songwriting work and potentially the work of others. Baird and media artist Taurin Barrera debuted an immersive audio-visual installation at the Museum of Human Achievement in 2014 centered around a fictional time-share salesman and a bag of Chee-tos used as an electronic controller for all aspects of the room. A public access opera, \\"Mundus Novus,\\" written while in residence with Paul Dresher, was premiered at the 2015 Switchboard Music Festival in San Francisco. A corresponding live TV performance aired on his Berkeley Public Access TV show later that year. Later in 2015, he collaborated with SwissNex, the SF Swiss Consulate, and Gray Area Foundation for the Arts on an interactive exhibition. His video installation for The Society for Hard Determinists, a 2015 theater work, was nominated for the B. Iden Payne award for \\"Outstanding Media Design.\\" The following year, an interactive multi-media sculptural work, \\"It's Not a Bubble,\\" premiered at the Fort Mason Center for Arts and Culture for the 2016 Soundwaves Festival.

It crosses the Gwangyang western river, a railway and a roadway in South Korea. It was built by Iksan Regional Construction & Management Administration.\\"Korean Curves\\", Bridge Design & Engineering, Issue No. 55, 2Q 2009, page 46 History Construction commenced in October 2006 and was completed in June 2014. The bridge was built by contractor Daelim Industrial Co., LTD. The contract amount was 23.0 million USD.‚ÄúDaelim bridge‚Äù 2013 http://www.daelim.co.kr/static/data/brochure_eng.pdf The side spans of the bridge and the approach bridges were built using full staging, while the main spans at each tower were built out using the free cantilever method. For the erection of the 6m-long, 210t segments, a form traveler facilitated easy observation of the operation and was suitable for cast-in-place concrete. The construction of three pylons was carried out in auto climbing form because of safety risks from working over the sea. PY1, PY2 and PY3 are 86.7m, 101m and 88m respectively in height and are made of concrete grade 40MPa. PY1 and PY3 were constructed at the same time. After finishing the construction of two pylons, PY2 was built. Design The bridge is 875m long. It consists of a 150m-long approach bridge and a multi-span cable-stayed bridge with two 220m-long main spans and 52.5m-long side spans. The Sepung bridge is curved with a radius of 2000m. In order to reduce the deformation of the pylons toward the center of the circle, two cables run from the top to the bottom of the pylon. It is also effective for increasing the torsional rigidity. This bridge is designed to accommodate dual four-lane traffic; its design incorporates a curved stiffening girder and additional transverse cables to stabilize each tower. The stiffening girder is designed as a PC box using reinforced concrete of grade 40MPa; It is 3.3m deep and almost 24m wide, and incorporates steel struts and FRP pipe struts filled with concrete in the internal and external box respectively, to resist the local tensile stress. These internal and external struts are placed at typical centers of 6m and 3m, respectively, and give the stiffening girder and increased torsional rigidity and make the decks 20% lighter than a traditional concrete box girder. In this bridge, a single plane multiple cable system with harp arrangement was chosen in order to reduce the longitudinal and transverse deformation of the towers. As the shear center deviates from the center of the stiffening girder due to the application of the asymmetric cable forces and self-weight, twisting and transverse deformation may occur.

It contains the main conceptual topics of discussion about poverty and inequality, offering analytic tools applied to household survey data from every Latin American country. Every chapter includes an appendix with Stata commands so as the readers could replicate the results and the first two chapters of the book, additional material and authors‚Äô information are available here.  Research Projects = Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC) = The Center for Distributional, Labor and Social Studies (CEDLAS) of the University of La Plata, in partnership with the World Bank Latin America and the Caribbean Poverty and Gender Group (LCSPP), have developed the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC) with the purpose of improving the timely access to key socio-economic statistics, including indicators on poverty, inequality, income, employment, access to services, education, health, housing, social programs, and numerous demographics. All statistics are computed from microdata of the main household surveys carried out in the countries. Household surveys are not uniform among countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. In particular, they differ significantly in their geographic coverage and questionnaires. There are also differences in the periodicity of surveys within a country. This project seeks to ensure that statistics are comparable, as far as possible, between countries and over time. This is done using similar definitions of variables in each country/year and applying consistent methods of data processing. In this way SEDLAC allows users to monitor the trends in poverty and other distributional and social indicators in the region. The dataset is available in the form of brief reports, charts and electronic Excel tables with information for each country/year. In addition, the website visitor can carry out dynamic searches online in the official website. This website presents enough documentation so that each user decides whether or not to make comparisons, considering the available information, their preferences and needs. The Methodological Guide describes the tables available in each section of the database, and discusses the main methodological decisions taken to construct the variables. This section contains methodological documents with precise explanations of the construction and estimation of each variable, the countries and surveys analyzed, and the period covered in the SEDLAC database. The database includes information from over 300 household surveys carried out in 24 LAC countries: Argentina, Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela. In each period the sample of countries represents more than 97% of LAC total population. The database mainly covers the 1990s and 2000s, although they also present information for previous decades in a few countries. SEDLAC is continually updated and improved based on the feedback from users. Aside from cross country analyses, staff from CEDLAS and LCSPP analyze and incorporate the data at the country level each time a new survey is available. Consistency checks with other national or international sources of socio-economic statistics are conducted regularly. Through the support to this project LCSPP contributes to develop analytical capacity and facilitate policy relevant research in the Latin America and Caribbean region that can contribute to reduce poverty and inequality. Social and distributive indicators from these dataset are used for the World Bank World Development Indicators and published in the WIDER-UN World Income Inequality Database. = Labor markets for inclusive growth in Latin America = The Center for Distributional, Labor and Social Studies (CEDLAS) in cooperation with the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) from Canada, have developed a research project about the role of the labor market as vectors of inclusive growth in Latin America. It will seek to account for the implications of changes in labor supply, firm employment demand, labor market policies and partial social protection reforms. The research and capacity building agenda lies at the intersection of labor supply and demand perspectives, which have addressed these issues separately in the existing literature for the region. The project will contribute to bridge the two approaches by jointly developing a series of studies at the worker and at the firm levels. This research agenda will provide evidence on the inter-relation between social protection reforms, informality, poverty reduction, labor market regulations, crises, job creation and productivity. All the Project studies, the rest of the activities, labor market indicators and maps can be found in the project's website. = Enhancing Women‚Äôs Economic Empowerment through Better Policies in Latin America = The Interdisciplinary Center for Development Studies-Uruguay, CIEDUR, with the Center for Distributional, Labor and Social Studies (CEDLAS) in Argentina and the support the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) from Canada, are working together in the development of this research project. The project's objective is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of policies that promote gender equality in labor markets. The reality of eight Latin American countries like Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua and Uruguay, are being studied applying an innovative mix of research methods, including econometrics models, impact evaluation of the policies, meta analysis and depth interviews. The project will provide country level and comparative empirical evidence that will serve as inputs to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of policies that promote gender equality. The comparative analysis of countries, which all experienced sustained economic growth, will provide insights into the factors that contribute to the persistence of gender inequalities amidst such growth, and the role of institutional frameworks and policies that could have a major impact to tackle them. In the project's website are the research findings, the projects activities and data including visualization tools. = Fostering capacities in Impact Evaluation in Latin America = With the support of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC-Canada), CEDLAS will aim to develop a capacity building initiative based on training courses on impact evaluation, scholarships and other activities to foster professional education. The objective is to provide training activities in impact evaluation in the region on a regular basis. More information can be found in the website.

The blue lines mark areas of Western Europe that did not conform to Western Europe's marriage pattern The Western European marriage pattern is a family and demographic pattern that is marked by comparatively late marriage (in the middle twenties), especially for women, with a generally small age difference between the spouses, a significant proportion of women who remain unmarried, and the establishment of a neolocal household after the couple has married. In 1965, John Hajnal discovered that Europe is divided into two areas characterized by a different patterns of nuptiality. To the west of the line, marriage rates and thus fertility were comparatively low and a significant minority of women married late or remained single and most families were nuclear; to the east of the line and in the Mediterranean and particular regions of Northwestern Europe, early marriage and extended family homes were the norm and high fertility was countered by high mortality.Hajnal, John (1965): European marriage pattern in historical perspective en D.V. Glass and D.E.C. Eversley, (eds.) Population in History, Arnold, Londres.Kertzer, David I and Marzio Barbagli. 2001. The history of the European family. New Haven: Yale University Press. p xiv Overview The shift toward this ‚ÄúWestern European Marriage Pattern‚Äù does not have a clear beginning, but it certainly had become established by the end of the sixteenth century on most of the shores of the North Sea. A marriage pattern where couples married comparatively late in life (and especially late for the bride), on average in the middle twenties after and setting up a nuclear household, all of this preceded by time working as servants or apprentices. Also, a significant proportion of women married after their twenties and 10‚Äì20% of women never married.Coontz, Stephanie. 2005. Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage. New York City: Viking Press, Penguin Group Inc. p 125-129. =Effects= The pattern of late and non-universal marriage restricted fertility massively, especially when it was coupled with very low levels of childbirth out of wedlock. Birth control took place by delaying marriage more than suppressing fertility within it. A woman's life- phase from menarche (which was generally reached on average at 14 years, at about 12 years for elite womenHajnal, John (1965): European marriage pattern in historical perspective en D.V. Glass and D.E.C. Eversley, (eds.) Population in History, Arnold, Londres. 123) to the birth of her first child was unusually long, averaging ten years. Compared to other cultures This marriage pattern varied across time and space and class; noblewomen certainly married early, but they were a small minority. The comparatively late age at marriage for women and the small age gap between spouses is rather unusual; women married as adults rather than as dependents, often worked before marriage and brought some skills into the marriage, were less likely to be exhausted by constant pregnancy, and were about the same age as their husbands Stone, Linda. 2010. Kinship and Gender. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press. Pg. 227Coontz, 2005. Pg. 129 To the west of the Hajnal line, about half of all women aged 15 to 50 years of age were married at any given time while the other half were widows or spinsters; to the east of the line, about seventy percent of women in that age bracket were married at any given time while the other thirty percent were widows or nuns.Kertzer 2001; 224‚Äì225 The marriage records of Western and Eastern Europe in the early 20th century illustrate this pattern vividly; west of the Hajnal line, only 25% of women aged 20‚Äì24 were married while to the east of the line, over 75% of women in this age group were married and less than five percent of women remained unmarried. Outside of Europe, women could be married even earlier and even fewer would remain celibate; in Korea, practically every woman 50 years of age had been married and spinsters were extremely rare, compared to 10‚Äì25% of women in western Europe age 50 who had never married. Variation within Western Europe Where in the mid-1500s in England, approximately 8 percent of women remained unmarried the inference would be that that figure was either the same or lower in the previous several centuries; marriage in Medieval England appears to be a robust institution where over 90% of women married and roughly 70% of women aged 15 to 50 years were married at any given time while the other 30% were single or widows. In Yorkshire in the 14th and 15th centuries, the age range for most brides was between 18 and 22 years and the age of the grooms was similar; rural Yorkshire women tended to marry in their late teens to early twenties while their urban counterparts married in their early to middle twenties. In the 15th century, the average Italian bride was 18 and married a groom 10‚Äì12 years her senior. An unmarried Tuscan woman 21 years of age would be seen as past marriageable age, the benchmark for which was 19 years, and easily 97 percent of Florentine women were married by the age of 25 years while 21 years was the average age of a contemporary English bride.Philips, Kim M. 2003. Medieval Maidens: Young Women and Gender in England, C.1270-c.1540. Manchester University Press. Pg 37De Moor, Tine and Jan Luiten van Zanden. 2009. p 16-18 While the average age at first marriage had climbed to 25 years for women and 27 years for men in England and the Low Countries by the end of the 16th century,De Moor, 2009; 17 and the percentage of unmarried Englishwomen rose from less than 10% to nearly 20% by the mid-17th century and their average age at first marriage rose to 26 years at the same time, there was nonetheless great variation within Britain alone; while Lowland Scotland saw patterns similar to England, with women married in the middle twenties after a period of domestic service, the high birth rate of Highland Scotland and the Hebrides imply a lower age of marriage for the bride, possibly similar to Gaelic Ireland,A. Lawrence, \\"Women in the British Isles in the sixteenth century\\", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, A Companion to Tudor Britain (Oxford: Blackwell John Wiley & Sons, 2008), , p. 384. where Brehon Law stated that women became legally marriageable at 15 years and men at 18 years. Similarly, between 1620 and 1690 the average age of first marriage for Swedish women was roughly 20 years, approximately 70% of Swedish women aged between 15 and 50 years were married at any one time, and the proportion of single women was less than 10%, but by the end of the 18th century it had risen to roughly 27 years and remained high with the celibacy rate as a result of falling infant mortality rates, declining famines, decreasing available land and resources for a growing population, and other factors. Similarly, Ireland's age of marriage in 1830 was 23.8 for women and 27.47 for men where they had once been 21 and 25, respectively, and only about 10% of adults remained unmarried; in 1840, they had respectively risen to 24.4 and 27.7; in the decades after the Great Famine, the age of marriage had risen to 28‚Äì29 for women and 33 for men and as much as a third of Irishmen and a fourth of Irishwomen never married due to chronic economic problems that discouraged early marriage. Background =Antiquity= The beginnings of this marriage pattern might be found as early as the time of the Roman Empire. Julius Caesar, writing in the first century B.C, wrote that while the Germanic tribes to the north of the empire were communal with their land, living under the Sippe kinship system, the homesteads were largely separate from each other, unlike the closer proximity in Roman towns. And Tacitus, writing a century and a half later, also observed these many private households among the Germanic tribes, although there was public ownership of pastures and controlled use of the forests.Gies, Frances and Joseph. 1989. Marriage and Family in the Middle Ages. Harper Perennial. Pg. 31‚Äì32 Anglo-Saxon kinship terms were generally very basic; the same word is used for the titles of nephew and grandson, likewise for the term for granddaughter and niece. Based on this, the nuclear household seems to be the norm. Also, since the Church forbade marrying within a given degree of kinship, the common people were probably further discouraged from keeping elaborate kinship networks; Britain only had so many people and virtually everybody on the island was related to some degree and possibly the distant relations had to be forgotten or nearly all marriages would be within the prohibited degrees. In any case, while nuclear residences might have been the norm for families, the extended family was undeniably important for the Anglo-Saxons; As with many other Germanic tribes, if a member of a family was wronged or injured in any way, the Kentish Laws outlines the restrictions of feuds and reparations to the victim of the offense; kindreds were to take charge of reparation and they could (with a few exceptions, for example, when the conflict was too close in blood-line) arrange either for vengeance or for the payment of compensation to the kin of the killed.Hines, John. 1997. The Anglo-Saxons from the Migration Period to the Eighth Century. Boydell Press. Pgs. 214‚Äì215. In addition, Anglo-Saxon women, like those of other Germanic tribes, are marked as women from the age of twelve onward, based on archaeological finds, implying that the age of marriage coincided with puberty.Green, Dennis Howard and Siegmund, Frank. 2003. The Continental Saxons from the Migration Period to the Tenth Century. Boydell Press. Pg. 107 =Middle Ages= Christianity and manorialism The rise of Christianity created more incentives to keep families nuclear; the Church instituted marriage laws and practices that undermined large kinship groups. From as early as the fourth century, the Church discouraged any practice that enlarged the family, like adoption, polygamy, taking concubines, divorce, and remarriage. The Church severely discouraged and prohibited consanguineous marriages, a marriage pattern that has constituted a means to maintain kinship groups (and thus their power) throughout history; Canon law followed civil law until the early ninth century, when the Western Church increased the number of prohibited degrees from four to seven.Bouchard, Constance B., 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', Speculum, Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 269‚Äì70 The church also clipped the ability of parents to retain kinship ties through arranged marriages by forbidding unions in which the bride did not clearly agree to the union. These rules were not necessarily followed unanimously nor did all cultures across Europe evolve toward nuclear families, but by the latter half of the Middle Ages the nuclear household was dominant over most of Northwestern Europe and where in the old indigenous religions, women married between 12 and 15 years of age (coinciding with puberty) and men married in their middle twenties, as Christianity expanded men married increasingly earlier and women married increasingly laterHerlihy, David. 1985. Medieval Households. Harvard University Press. Pgs. 17‚Äì19 The rise of manorialism in the vacuum left after the Fall of Rome might also have weakened the ties of kinship at the same time that the Church had curtailed the power of clans; as early as the 800s in northern France, families that worked on manors were small, consisting of parents and children and occasionally a grandparent. The Church and State had become allies in erasing the solidarity and thus the political power of the clans; the Church sought to replace traditional religion, whose vehicle was the kin group, and substituting the authority of the elders of the kin group with that of a religious elder, the presbyter. At the same time, the king's rule was undermined by revolts on the part of powerful, communal kin groups, whose conspiracies and murders threatened the power of the state and, once manorialism had become established, also threatened the demand of manorial lords for obedient, compliant workers; in the west, manorialism was unsuccessful in establishing itself in Frisia, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the East of England, and the south of Iberia and Italy.Heather, Peter. 1999. The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective. Boydell & Brewer Ltd. Pgs 142‚Äì148Mitterauer, Michael. 2010. Why Europe?: The Medieval Origins of Its Special Path. University of Chicago Press. Pg. 53‚Äì57 As the peasants and serfs lived and worked on farms that they rented from the lord of the manor, and they also needed the permission of the lord to marry, couples therefore had to comply with the lord and wait until a small farm became available before they could marry and thus produce children; those who could and did delay marriage presumably were rewarded by the landlord and those who did not were presumably denied said reward.2014\\\\. Medieval Manorialism and the Hajnal Line Indeed, Medieval England saw marriage age as variable depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until the early twenties when times were bad and the average age falling to the late teens after the Black Death, when there were labor shortages; by appearances, marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England. The sudden loss of people from the plague resulted in a glut of lucrative jobs for many people and more people could afford to marry young, lowering the age at marriage to the late teens and thus increasing fertility.Lehmberg, Stanford E. and Samantha A. Meigs. 2008. The Peoples of the British Isles: A New History: From Prehistoric Times to 1688. Lyceum Books. Pg. 117 The beginnings of consensual marriage About 1140, Gratian established that according to canon law the bonds of marriage should be determined by mutual consent and not consummation, voicing opinions similar to Isaac's opinion of forced marriages; marriages were made by God and the blessing of a priest should only be made after the fact. Therefore, a man and a woman could agree to marry each other at even the minimum age of consent- fourteen years for men, twelve years for women- and bring the priest after the fact. But this doctrine led to the problem of clandestine marriage, performed without witness or connection to public institution.De Moor 2009. Pg 5‚Äì6 The opinion of the parents was still important, although the final decision was not the decision to be made by the parents,Huijgen, Carolien. 2010. Family formation and marriage patterns: A comparison between Sri Lanka and Europe. University of Utrecht. 31 November 2011. for this new consent by both parties meant that a contract between equals was drawn rather than a coerced consensus.De Moor 2009. Pg 6 Patriarchy remained in some form or another, including the necessity of the dowry by young women. To curb secret marriages and remind young couples of parental power, the Medieval Church encouraged prolonged courtship, arrangements and monetary logistics, informing the community of the wedding, and finally the formal exchange of vows.Coontz, Stephanie. 2005. Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage. New York City: Viking Press, Penguin Group Inc. Pg 107 While in the South a woman's dowry was viewed as separate from her husband's wealth, in the Northwest the dowry was \\"conjugal\\"; a woman's dowry merged with her husband's wealth and would grow or shrink depending on circumstances and to which she had rights in widowhood,De Moor, 2009. Pg 8 an attractive incentive for women to earn money. And the chance for women to earn money in the one hundred and fifty years after the Black Death was attractive, with less competition for jobs; as much as half of women in the North willingly worked to earn money for marriage while their Southern contemporaries were married or widows before turning to work and unmarried young women only worked as a last resort, lest her honor be put at risk.De Moor 2009. Pgs 11‚Äì12 =Early Modern Europe= The average age at first marriage had gradually risen again by late sixteenth century; the population had stabilized and availability of jobs and land had lessened. In the last decades of the century the age at marriage had climbed to averages of 25 for women and 27 for men in England and the Low Countries as more people married later or remained unmarried due to lack of money or resources and a decline in living standards, and these averages remained high for nearly two centuries and averages across Northwestern Europe had done likewise.De Moor, 2009. Pg 17 Because of its sacramental nature, marriage was increasingly held to be indissoluble, and sexual relations outside of marriage were viewed as illicit. Christian Europe banned polygamy and divorce, and attempted to prohibit any form of sexual relationship that was not marriage, such as concubine or premarital sex, termed fornication. Women were generally expected to bring a dowry when they married, which ranged from a few household goods to a whole province in the case of the high nobility. Remarriage after the death of a spouse was acceptable for both men and women, and very common, though men remarried faster than women. Most issues regarding marriage and many other aspects of family life came under the jurisdiction of church courts and were regulated by an increasingly elaborate legal system termed canon law. The ideals for marriage were not followed in many instances: powerful individuals could often persuade church courts to grant annulments of marriages they needed to end; men, including priests and other church leaders, had concubines and mistresses; young people had sex before marriage and were forced into marriages that they did not want. Nevertheless, these ideals and the institutions established to enforce them remained important shapers of men's and women's understanding of and place within a family. So many Englishmen began migrating en masse to North America that the marriage prospects for unmarried Englishwomen dwindled and the average age of first marriage rose for Englishwomen. In addition, there was a sharp rise in the percentage of women who remained unmarried and thus decreased fertility; an Englishwoman marrying at the average age of 26 years in the late 17th century who survived her childbearing years would bear an average of 5.03 children while an Englishwoman making a comparable marriage in the early 19th century at the average age of 23.5 years and surviving her childbearing years would bear on average 6.02 children, an increase of about 20 percent. From 1619 to 1660 in the archdiocese of Canterbury, England, the median age of the brides was 22 years and nine months while the median age for the grooms was 25 years and six months, with average ages of 24 years for the brides and nearly 28 years for the grooms, with the most common ages at marriage being 22 years for women and 24 years for men; the Church dictated that the age when one could marry without the consent of one's parents was 21 years. A large majority of English brides in this time were at least 19 years of age when they married, and only one bride in a thousand was thirteen years of age or younger. William Shakespeare's drama Romeo and Juliet puts Juliet's age at just short of fourteen years; the idea of a woman marrying in secret at a very early age would have scandalized Elizabethans. The common belief in Elizabethan England was that motherhood before 16 was dangerous; popular manuals of health, as well as observations of married life, led Elizabethans to believe that early marriage and its consummation permanently damaged a young woman's health, impaired a young man's physical and mental development, and produced sickly or stunted children. Therefore, 18 came to be considered the earliest reasonable age for motherhood and 20 and 30 the ideal ages for women and men, respectively, to marry. Shakespeare might also have reduced Juliet's age from sixteen to fourteen to demonstrate the dangers of marriage at too young of an age; that Shakespeare himself married Anne Hathaway when he was just eighteen (very unusual for an Englishman of the time) might hold some significance.

They had seven children, of which five became monks; three of the children were David, George and Symeon. David, the eldest, was born around 717 or 718 AD; he learned how to read and write by 16 and he was the shepherd of his father's sheep. During the time of a huge storm he saw a dream and Saint Anthony appeared to him and instructed him to travel to a monastery in Asia Minor, at Mount Ida. Exhibiting discipline at the mountain, he lived inside of a cave and ate wild greens. He lived there for 30 years. In another dream, he was instructed to go to the Bishop of Gargara to be ordained a deacon and later an Elder Priest. He later returned to the monastery in Mount Ida. He saw another dream and was instructed by an angel to build the church Saint Kirikou and Ioulittis and a monastery where many monks gathered. This is an example of a priest on a pillar. After ten years his mother arrived to inform him that his father had died. She was with his youngest brother Symeon who was 8 years old. He was born either in 765 or 766 AD. Symeon lived with his brother; his mother returned to Mytilene and after a short time died. Symeon learned how to read and write living at his brother's monastery. Symeon at age 22 also became a monk at the monastery; by age 28 he was ordained. David saw a vision of his death in a dream and informed his younger brother to go back to Mytilene. Two years later David died at the age of 66. Symeon composed himself and on the command of his brother returned to Mytilene. He went to the church of Panagia which was at the north harbor of the island maybe Apano Skala. There he followed a similar model to Simeon Stylites. He climbed up a pillar-like structure similar to a tower. The term Stylite is Greek it comes from the word œÉœÑœÖŒªŒØ which means poll or column. There he isolated himself, fasted, worshiped and studied. Symeon also at this point found his other brother George born 763 AD who was a monk and an ordained priest and their sister Illaria also a monk. Together with other priests, they built a huge monastery. The Monastery drew a huge amount of Christian worshipers who were thirsty to hear the Word of God. The worshipers were asking for the blessing of the holy monks. On 19 April 797 Constantine VI was imprisoned captured and blinded by supporters of his mother. Irene of Athens organized a conspiracy. She was to be crowned as the first Empress regnant of Constantinople. She was exiled to Lesbos around 802. She was in favor of icons and was forced into poverty, spinning was her means of survival. One year later she died. The peace of the beautiful monastery was disrupted by The second iconoclast period: 814‚Äì842 instituted by Emperor Leo V the Armenian. The Emperor decreed persecution against Christians due to military failure the Byzantines suffered at the hands of Bulgarian Khan Krum. He wanted the same blessing that Constantine V had from the first iconoclast period: 730‚Äì787 The bishop of Mytilene also named George, was exiled and a new bishop of Mytilene was chosen, he was loyal to Emperor Leo V the Armenian. He immediately began a campaign against the famed monks including Symeon and the monastery. With the orders of the iconoclast Bishop, Symeon is ordered to be put to death by fire. With the aid of a miracle he is saved and he climbs his pillar where he stays for a period of time emulating Simeon Stylites. The angry bishop wishes Symeon to leave the city and never return. He is exiled to a small island with his monks called Saint Isidore. The area of the island of Lesbos was in the Gulf of Gera, close to Loutra near Kountouroudia. Saint Symeon was again pursued by the iconoclast bishop because Emperor Michael II reissued orders against Symeon exiling him yet again to an uninhabited rock- like island across from Troy Lagousa. Symeon went there with 7 of his students. He again climbed the pillar and stayed for 10 days. His brother George stayed in Lesbos to watch over the Monastery. Saint Symeon after a while traveled to Constantinople where he understood he would be extremely useful to the church. He settled at the Monastery of Medicium home of Saint Nikitas the Confessor near the city of Tirilye on the Sea of Marmara. With the Monastery of Medicium as his epicenter, he toured the Dardanelles to the Aegean islands to the Black Sea. At these places, he would stand by the exiled priests hiding from the iconoclasts. At his time in exile Symeon worked as a fisherman wherever he stopped, he worked to help the people in need more than helping himself. Touring the Northern Aegean and Asia Minor he not only taught but he also healed the sick and founded a female Monastery by the grace of God, where many nuns gathered. Emperor of the Byzantium Michael II died. His iconoclast successor Theophilos (emperor) waged a bigger war against the church. Symeon and his entourage were arrested with the intent of imprisonment and being put to death. He was saved for a second time miraculously with the intervention of Theodora (wife of Theophilos). He was not lucky enough to escape 150 lashes which were ordered by the Emperor. He was then exiled to Aphousia an island in the Sea of Marmara. He was there with other distinguished priests of the Byzantium such as Theophanes the Branded and his brother Theodore the hymnographers. At this place of exile, Saint Symeon of Lesbos built a church in honor of the Virgin Mary and monastery where all the persecuted exiled iconoclast priests gathered. Meanwhile, in Lesbos Symeon's brother George awaited his return but he also had serious problems with the iconoclasts during the time of Leo V the Armenian around 813-820. The iconoclasts Bishop of the island pressured him with various methods until he exiled him from Mytilene. The bishop illegally seized the Monastery and sold all the family's belongings. George was forced to leave with his monks to a place on the island called Myrsina. Phountoules and Malamut identify Myrsinas with a site near the gulf of Gera in Lesbos where a monastery of Panagia Myrsiniotissa was constructed in the 12th century.Talbot, Alice-Mary \\"Byzantine Defenders of Images: Eight Saints' Lives in English Translation.\\" Dumbarton Oaks 1998 But even at this location Christians came and found them and George taught and performed miracles. When the Emperor Theophilos died, his wife Theodora rescinded the exile of all priests including George and his Brother Symeon. George and Symeon along with Methodios I of Constantinople the confessor became the most trusted advisors to Empress Theodora. Around 843 A.D. with the advice of Symeon, Methodios I became the Patriarch of Constantinople. Symeon with his students settled at the monastery then known as the Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus George was asked by Empress Theodora to become Bishop of Ephesus. He did not accept the position due to his old age. He was 80 years old at the time. After many attempts by Empress Theodora, he accepted to become the Bishop of the Metropolis Mytilene. Soon after he was ordained by the Empress, Empress Theodora, her brother Petronas and noble Bardas gave many gifts to the poor of the island. George entered the port with the royal navy accompanied by generals and members of Empress Theodora's court. George was greeted with joy and happiness. The monks finally got back there monastery and they celebrated after being exiled for many years. Specifically, they celebrated the Birth of the Virgin Mary (8 September 843 A.D.). After several days George took his enthronement at the church of Saint Theodora, which was the Metropolitan Church on 14 of September during the Feast of the Cross. One year later around 844 A.D., Saint Symeon Stylites of Lesbos George's brother died. He was buried at the Monastery of the Virgin Mary. The winter of the same year Saint George the Archbishop of Mytilene visited the land of the Goths to see a sick friend. With the Lord's help, Saint George's friend was healed. He envisioned a prophecy that he will die in seven years as he did. He returned to Mytilene and continued his work teaching and healing. He performed his miracles as the good Shepherd. He went to Smyrna during the winter. There he wanted to see his spiritual children and monasteries, which he founded on plots his students gave him. At Smyrna, he stayed a few days because an angel came to him and announced his death was soon. He immediately returned to Mytilene where he survived the entire Great Lent he even performed the service of Holy Thursday. He understood the end was near. He gave his final commands to his spiritual children the monks and nuns. He gave his soul to the lord on the night of the Great Sabbath or Holy Saturday around 845 or 846 A.D. They buried him next to his brother Saint Symeon Stylites of Lesbos. The remains of the two saints were never discovered but are somewhere on the island of Lesbos. Saint David the Monk may be buried somewhere else. The three brothers are Saints; Saint George the Archbishop of Mytilene, Saint Symeon Stylites of Lesbos, and Saint David the Monk.

The organization's mission is to promote excellence in stem cell science and applications to human health. History The International Society for Stem Cell Research was formed in 2002 (incorporated on March 30, 2001) to foster the exchange of information on stem cell research.\\"About Us\\". International Society for Stem Cell Research. Leonard Zon, professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, served as the organization's first president. In June 2003, the International Society for Stem Cell Research held its first convention. More than 600 scientists attended, many of whom expressed frustration over restrictions that President George W. Bush's administration had placed on the field of stem-cell research, slowing the pace of research. Scientists who were leaders in their fields were prohibited from using funding from the National Institutes of Health to conduct certain experiments that could provide significant medical achievements. As a service to the field, in 2006 the ISSCR developed guidelines that address the international diversity of cultural, political, legal, and ethical perspectives related to stem cell research and its translation to medicine. The guidelines were designed to underscore widely shared principles in science that call for rigor, oversight, and transparency in all areas of practice. Adherence to the ISSCR guidelines would provide assurance that stem cell research is conducted with scientific and ethical integrity and that new therapies are evidence-based. In response to advances in science, the guidelines were updated in 2008, and again in 2016 to encompass a broader and more expansive scope of research and clinical endeavor than before, imposing rigor on all stages of the research, addressing the cost of regenerative medicine products, and highlighting the need for accurate and effective public communication. The 2016 Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation have been adopted by researchers, clinicians, organizations, and institutions around the world. In 2013, the Society's official journal, Stem Cell Reports, was established; it is published monthly by Cell Press on the Society's behalf. In March 2015, scientists, including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide hold on germline gene therapy, writing \\"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\\" until the full implications \\"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\\". After the publication that a Chinese group had used CRISPR to modify a gene in human embryos, the group repeated their call for a suspension of \\"attempts at human clinical germ-line genome editing while extensive scientific analysis of the potential risks is conducted, along with broad public discussion of the societal and ethical implications.\\" The ISSCR‚Äôs Annual Meetings are the largest stem cell research conferences in the world, drawing nearly 3,900 attendees in 2020 for the organizations first, global virtual event, ISSCR 2020 Digital.

After user trials were conducted in 2017, ST Kinetics demonstrated the production version of the rifle, which was given the name of BR18 at the 2018 Singapore Airshow exhibition. Design The BR18's barrel is coated with a proprietary dry lubricant which repels sand, dust, and gunpowder soot for reduced maintenance. The rifle is also designed to be over the beach (OTB) capable, enabling the operator to safely fire after submerging the rifle in water. The weapon is constructed of reinforced, blast-proof polymer and is equipped with MIL-STD-1913 \\"Picatinny\\" rails to mount scopes and other tactical accessories. While the design was influenced by the SAR-21, the BR18 allows it to be used by both left or right handed users with empty casing ejections set forward and to the right away from the person's face after the weapon is fired from the left shoulder. This negates the necessity of a deflector to ensure the person's face is not hit by hot brass. ST Kinetics has said that the BR18 has an effective range of 460 m and 800 m when fired with M193 and SS109 ammunition respectively, with a muzzle velocity of 860 m/s when employing SS109 rounds out of the \\"Assault\\" variant, equipped with a 14.5\\" barrel. The charging handle is placed above the trigger guard. Initial designs showed the charging handle positioned above the cheek rest, which mean that the person would be forced to move from it in order to pull the bolt. Pre-production models improved on this by designing the charging handle to be foldable with one hand and pulled back by using two fingers, using the force of the handle moving to be stowed. The trigger guard can be flipped outwards so that the shooter can handle the weapon if using gloves. While a 5.56 version is being scheduled for production, a 7.62x51mm NATO version is currently being developed. The BR18 can use a STK-made 40 GL attached underneath the barrel via picatinny rails.

The Grand Standard Bearer of the Crown was the fourth in military commandership after the King, the \\"Hetman Wielki\\" (the military Commander in Chief) and the ‚ÄúHetman Polny‚Äù (the Field Commander). Alexander's military career began probably during the Cossack uprising of Bohdan Zynoviy Mykhailovych Khmelnytsky. In 1656 he participated in the war with the Swedes, fighting in the battles of Prostki and Filip√≥w. In the years 1657‚Äì1659, together with Polish Hetman Stefan Czarniecki he was dispatched on Western Pomerania and Denmark. Probably commanded the Czarniecki's right wing divisions at the battle of Po≈Çonka, on June 27, 1660. He was also actively involved in Ukraine. He participated in the Battles of Lyubar and S≈Çobodyszcze. In autumn 1663 under the leadership of Polish King John II Casimir Vasa took part in the expedition to Dniprovsky. Shortly, he defected to the field of Prince Jerzy or George Sebastian Lubomirski opposite to the last King Vasa. Later he returned to the rightful King's field and commanded troops in battle against Lubomirski‚Äô rebels near Czestochowa. After the end of Lubomirski's rebellion, Polanowski entered in the service of the Crown Hetman Jan or John Sobieski (future elected King John III Sobieski), who during the free election in 1669 was the major candidate for the Polish Crow and therefore ruler of ‚ÄúThe Commonwealth‚Äù (the whole Realm ‚Äì nowadays Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Latvia, etc. ). He participated in the expedition to Hajec, commanding the left side of the Polish army. In the years 1671-1676 he fought against the Turkish and Tartars troops, participating in the expedition to Bratslav, and fighting the Tatars in Chocimska campaign. In August 1683 went to Vienna, but during the military taking exercise in Tarn√≥w Mountains became ill and had to return to his homeland. Soon after, he resigned from the military, living with the profits of the salt mines of Krak√≥w given to him by the King of Poland (Jan III Sobieski) for live.

Frankencreepy is a 2014 direct-to-DVD animated comedy horror film, and the twenty-third film in the direct-to-video series of Scooby-Doo films. It premiered on July 27, 2014, at San Diego Comic-Con International, and was released on Digital HD on August 5, 2014. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 19, 2014. This film is dedicated to the original Shaggy voice actor, Casey Kasem, which is not shown in the film according to executives. Plot Velma gets a call from Cuthbert Crawley, a lawyer for Velma's family who tells her that she's inherited her great uncle's property and castle in Transylvania. Velma turns the offer down, replying she wants nothing to do with her uncle, puzzling the gang. Mr. Crawley understands, revealing the curse over the estate. He says that if anyone gets too close to the Baron legacy, then what they love the most will be destroyed. As they head outside, Fred hears a noise from the Mystery Machine, then it explodes and a mysterious character with a mask appears. Crawley reveals that it's the ghost of the Baron, Velma's old ancestor. The remains of the machine explode again, with words saying stay away from Transylvania, but Fred declares that is where they're going to find the person responsible for destroying the Mystery Machine, saying this time \\"it's personal\\". Having no other option, the gang ride in the express. Velma reveals the truth that her real last name is Von Dinkenstein, which her great grandparents shortened to Dinkley when they moved in from the old country. Her ancestor is Baron Von Dinkenstein, who was said to have created a monster called Frankencreep (which inspired famous novelist Mary Shelley to write her novel Frankenstein). Velma explains that this was the reason that she started solving mysteries. All of a sudden, the train starts to pick up speed. After getting everyone to the last car, Shaggy goes to the front of the train, but finds not the conductor but the Masked Baron's ghost, who states the curse is now affecting the gang just before he tears off the control panel, throws it and disappears. The gang still manage to save the last car, the people, and themselves just as the train derails and explodes. As they arrive in town, the people in the car are the inspector, burgermeister, and Iago, a hunchbacked servant of Castle Von Dinkenstein. He takes them to the castle, where they meet Mrs. Vanders, the housekeeper. They arrive in the Baron's laboratory and find Frankencreep in solid ice. Velma said she could prove that the monster was a fake and tells everyone else to leave. As the rest of the gang leave, Mrs. Vanders shows Velma a machine which hypnotizes her. Strange things start happening when the gang goes to a village festival. Daphne is shocked to find her current size clothes are now too tight for her, as she has gained weight. Shaggy and Scooby suddenly become brave and courageous and are not hungry either, and Fred mourns his beloved Mystery Machine. Iago arrives and saves the gang, who are being threatened by the villagers, and he tells the gang Velma has gone insane. When they return, Velma now has pink hair, new clothes, and has brought Frankencreep back to life. The villagers attempt to defend themselves and take down the monster, but Frankencreep scares them off. Daphne and Fred are still miserable by the losses and wander off to be alone, while Shaggy and Scooby, who are still brave, decide to capture Frankencreep themselves. Velma manages to knock out the monster and decides to remove Shaggy and Scooby's brains to put them in Frankencreep (stating the two of them together have one brain). Things start to get better, as Fred finds a workshop and builds a new mystery machine, Daphne finds that her dress is an inflatable suit with air and Frankencreep rips off Shaggy and Scooby's new outfits, turning them back to their old hungry and scared selves. When Frankencreep starts to chase them, it accidentally hits the lever of the machine that hypnotized Velma, bringing her back to normal. Iago appears and tells them that they need to leave the castle because it is about to explode. They manage to escape and fake their deaths. They lure the burgermeister, inspector, gypsy, and Mrs. Vanders to the express train. They trap them in an express car as the train drives. Just as the mystery seems to be solved, Frankencreep reappears revealing to be a robot with Iago, who then reveals he's actually an undercover DOD agent named Shimidlap. He says that one of the exoskeletons the infantry of humans was stolen from their research labs and traced it to Transylvania. It's soon revealed that instead of a suspect, it was actually a conspiracy of revenge: the burgermeister, inspector, gypsy, and housekeeper were all in on this. The inspector is unmasked to be Cuthbert Crawley who is actually Cuthbert Crawls (the partner of Cosgood Creeps where they haunted a mansion as green ghosts in \\"A Night of Fright is No Delight\\" from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?). The burgermeister is exposed by Velma to be C.L. Magnus (who posed as Redbeard's ghost), and then the gypsy reveals to be Lila (a singer who posed as one of Mamba Wamba's zombies). Finally, Mrs. Vanders is unmasked revealing to be Mama Mione (the cafe owner and criminal gang leader who dressed up as Old Iron Face). She reveals that Iron Face's mask was also the same mask as the baron's ghost had. The four criminals reveal that they planned on getting revenge and once they discover the history of Velma's ancestry, they bought the castle that was sitting on the natural gas which is explosive. Velma questions the villains on not selling the castle, revealing they could have made a huge fortune if they sold the land and they are shocked to learn this, as the Scooby gang laugh at this. They are soon arrested once again and the Mystery Machine is rebuilt and the gang takes off in it heading straight for home. At the beginning of the end credits, AlexSuperFan2112 points out some of the plot holes of Mystery Inc's mystery. This gets the attention of the DOD who take him away and cut off his computer broadcast.

Aerial Manx was born on 18 March 1986 in Melbourne, Australia. Early life Aerial Manx was born in 1986 in Melbourne, Australia. He began training in Martial Arts at age four, branding him with a unique understanding of physicality and mental focus. At age 15, Aerial was introduced to circus through the Circus Oz youth program. By age 17, Aerial had achieved a first Dan black belt in Jiu-Jitsu and was regularly traveling to Melbourne from South-East Victoria to attend Australia's first self-run Youth Circus, Trick Circus. Career Aerial enrolled at the National Institute of Circus Arts (NICA) at age 19, and completed his training at the school with his graduating performance during the 2007 NICA production of DiVino. While studying at NICA, Aerial focused on sideshow and mind-over-matter stunts as well as being trained Aerial Dance under Holly Rollins, an ex-Cirque Du Soleil performer. After leaving NICA in 2007, Aerial began his professional performing career performing fire eating in various nightclubs throughout Melbourne. During this initial stage, Aerial also began performing street theatre on the streets of Melbourne CBD. Aerial's busking show started out with basic skills, gradually building up to a duo show with The Great Gordo Gamsby, and has since built up to be a highly energetic solo circle busking show that showcases his skills in contortion, contact juggling, acrobatics and his signature stunts in the field of sword swallowing acrobats. Aerial has performed his busking show throughout the UK, Europe, South East Asia and the vast majority of Australia. At the 2007/8 Woodford Folk Music Festival, Aerial performed his first \\"world first\\" stunt with a double neon-tube swallow, swallowing two separate 2,000v simultaneously.

In March 2011, Aerial spent a day in the gardens of Melbourne CBD performing numerous stunts and being filmed for an unfinished documentary titled Aerial Manx, King of Swords. These stunts included the now signature move of Aerial Manx, the Sword Swallow backflip. This stunt was filmed when Aerial was invited to be a part of the Anatomy Arts documentary series for Matchbox Pictures, which was shot by Carnival Cinema, in the episode titled \\"Stomach\\" that was aired on the ABC on 19 March 2013.

Although its original name, Function Tracer, came from ftrace's ability to record information related to various function calls performed while the kernel is running, ftrace's tracing capabilities cover a much broader range of kernel's internal operations. With its various tracer plugins, ftrace can be targeted at different static tracepoints, such as scheduling events, interrupts, memory-mapped I/O, CPU power state transitions, and operations related to file systems and virtualization. Also, dynamic tracking of kernel function calls is available, optionally restrictable to a subset of functions by using globs, and with the possibility to generate call graphs and provide stack usage reports. At the same time, ftrace can be used to measure various latencies within the Linux kernel, such as for how long interrupts or preemption are disabled. An ftrace-enabled Linux kernel is built by enabling the kernel configuration option. The entire runtime interaction with ftrace is performed through readable and writable virtual files contained in a specifically mounted debugfs file system; as a result, ftrace requires no specialized userspace utilities to operate. However, there are additional userspace utilities that provide more advanced features for data recording, analysis and visualization; examples of such utilities are trace-cmd and KernelShark. Internally, ftrace relies on the gcc's profiling mechanism to prepend machine instructions to the compiled versions of all source-level kernel functions, which redirect the execution of functions to the ftrace's trampolines and tracer plugins that perform the actual tracing. These \\"entry point\\" instructions created by gcc are altered by ftrace when the kernel is booted, and varied later at runtime by ftrace between NOPs and actual jumps to the tracing trampolines, depending on the tracing types and options configured at runtime. ftrace is developed primarily by Steven Rostedt, and it was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 2.6.27, which was released on October 9, 2008.

History Only 23 examples of the Model 1909 were produced by Colt's Manufacturing Company for testing and evaluation by the United States Army Ordnance Corps. Nine M1909s were shipped to Lieutenant Col. John T. Thompson, who was at that time the Senior Assistant in the Office of the Chief of Ordnance.http://www.coltautos.com The M1909 was an improvement on the Colt Model 1907, which was an earlier design by Browning chambered in .45 ACP that was turned down by the United States Department of War due to several issues, including constant jamming. In August 1909, Browning demonstrated his new automatic to Lt. Col. Thompson by firing 500 rounds through it, demonstrating its superiority over the M1907. Thompson wrote a letter to Springfield Armory mentioning that Browning would be arriving shortly with his M1909, so a team of officers was assembled and the new automatic was subjected to a series of standard tests. A total of 722 rounds was fired through the weapon. The M1909 was reported to have performed exceedingly well in contrast with the M1907. The excellent reviews prompted Colt to produce even more, which were tested by other factions such as the United States Cavalry. As opposed to the glowing reports from Springfield Armory, the Cavalry felt that the M1909 was unsafe and overcomplicated for use by regular recruits, as it had no safety. Browning decided, as a result, to design the Colt Model 1910, and, in turn, the Colt M1911.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T99gu35N7KM References External links *Colt Automatic Pistols *Colt's Manufacturing Company‚Äîmanufacturer's website * Category:Colt semi-automatic pistols Category:Semi-automatic pistols 1901‚Äì1909 ","title":"Colt Model 1909"},{"id":"43371533","text":"The Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930 is a Mercantile Law, which came into existence on 1 July 1930, during the British Raj, borrowing heavily from the Sale of Goods Act 1893.

Definition The definitions as per Section II (s.2 Of Sale of Goods Act 1930) of the Act are as follows: =Contract= A Contract of Sale is: *an offer to buy for a price, or *An offer to sell good for a price, and *the acceptance of such offer. A Contract may provide for: *the immediate delivery of the goods, or *immediate payment of the price, or *the immediate delivery of the goods and payment both, or *for the delivery or payment by installments, or *that the delivery or payment or both shall be postponed. *per the Section 5 sub-clause (2) - Subject to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, a contract of sale may be made- *in writing or *by word of mouth, or *partly in writing and partly by word of mouth or *may be implied from the conduct of the parties. =Goods= Goods are every kind of moveable property other than actionable claims and money, and include: * Stock and shares, * Growing crops, * Grass, and * Things attached to or forming part of land which is agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale. Future goods are goods that are to be: * manufactured, or * produced, or * acquired, by the seller after making of the contract of sale According to the act, the goods which form the subject of a contract of sale may be either existing goods, owned or possessed by the seller, or future goods and there may be a contract for the sale of goods the acquisition of which by the seller depends upon a contingency which may or may not happen. Where by a contract of sale the seller purports to effect a present sale of future goods, the contract operates as an agreement to sell the goods. =Events and Participants= Sale of Goods A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price. There may be a contract of sale between one part-owner and another. Mercantile Agent A Mercantile Agent has the customary course of business as agent authority: * either to sell goods, or * to consign goods for the purposes of sale, or * to buy goods, or * to raise money on the security of goods. section-2(9) Buyer A person who buys or agrees to buy goods. Pricerefers to money considered for sale of goods. The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in manner thereby agreed, or may be determined by the course of dealing between the parties. Where the price is not determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the buyer shall pay the seller a reasonable price. Where there is an agreement to sell goods on the terms that- the price is to be fixed by the valuation of a third party, and such third party cannot or does not make such valuation, the agreement is thereby avoided, provided the goods or any part thereof have been delivered to the buyer, and appropriated by the buyer, the buyer shall pay a reasonable price. In the event of a dispute, the party not in fault may maintain a suit for damages against the party in fault. Delivery means voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another. State of Delivery Goods are said to be in a \\"delivered state\\" when they are in such state that the buyer would under the contract be bound to take delivery of them.

As per Section 8 of Sale of Goods Act, where there is an agreement to sell specific goods, and subsequently the goods without any fault on the part of the seller or buyer perish or become so damaged as no longer to answer to their description in the agreement before the risk passes to the buyer, the agreement is thereby avoided. =Violation= A \\"Fault\\" is defined as a wrongful act by default. A person is said to be \\"insolvent\\" when: * who has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business, or * cannot pay his debts as they become due, whether he has committed an act of insolvency or not. =Other Definitions= * \\"price\\" means the money consideration for a sale of goods. * \\"property\\" means the general property in goods, and not merely a special property. * \\"quality of goods\\" includes their state or condition. * \\"seller\\" means a person who sells or agrees to sell goods. * \\"specific goods\\" means goods identified and agreed upon at the time a contract of sale is made. * expressions used but not defined in this Act and defined in the Indian Contract Act, 1872, have the meaning assigned to them in that act. Requirements and Agreements Section 4 of Sale of Goods Act define the term \\"Sale\\" and \\"agreement to sell\\" as follows: * A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price. There may be a contract of sale between one part-owner and another. * A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional. * Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale, but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell. * An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred.

Madhushree Ghosh of The Times Of India rated the movie 2 and a half stars out of 5. She states that Raj was not in a mood of making a good plot unlike his earlier films such as Proloy and Kanamachi and that's why he leans on making a merely dull love story and some amount of South Indian Film oriented violence. She was also highly critical towards the lead characters' performances stating a emotionless, dull, charisma-lacking acting by both Bonny and Rittika but praised the performance of Sudip Mukherjee as a Muslim Mafia Don. Shoma A. Chatterji of The Indian Express commented that \\"The editing and cinematography of the action scenes are credible and good but what fails the film miserably is the performance of the romantic lead portrayed by Bonny and Ritika.

Rizzo. The series was one of several shows pitched to Adult Swim, according to the creators, who also operate under the name \\"Day by Day\\". Stewart recalled promoting it as a \\"one-line sentence\\", while Carsola remembered that it derived from a \\"write-off\\" session, where the two present ideas to each other in the form of scribbles for their amusement. Carsola explained that ideas in this process are released from the pressure \\"of them being good\\", occasionally finding \\"one that sticks\\". They later explained at the 2014 San Diego Comic- Con International that the idea was based on Lassie, but has become \\"more of its own thing since then.\\" Stewart's own female Australian Cattle Dog served as inspiration for the animators on the character of Mr. Pickles. Stewart even pointed out similarities between her and the main character, and jokingly called her \\"Ms. Pickles\\". Animation director Mike L. Mayfield recorded Stewart's dog playing around on video, with animators using the resulting footage as a basis for the character's movements. Its setting is roughly based on Richmond, Virginia, where the creators started out in entertainment before moving to Los Angeles. The creators are given creative freedom by the network, with Stewart explaining the notes received by them as \\"minimal\\", much to their surprise. The creators observed some inconsistencies as to what is considered unacceptable, but try not to question it and compromise instead. Elaborating on its 11-minute running time, Carsola described it as a 22-minute show \\"squished\\" into a quarter-hour. Among the voices for the characters include Brooke Shields, Frank Collison, Jay Johnston and Carsola and Stewart themselves. Shields' role in the series came after looking at the creator's work for Funny or Die and obtaining the script for Mr. Pickles. According to Carsola, the two were dubious over her interest in the series, but after being cast she provided lines in a recording booth in New York City while the creators supervised over Skype. Episodes Broadcast and reception The series was picked up for ten quarter-hour episodes for its first season, premiering on the network on September 21, 2014 following the ninth-season premiere of Squidbillies. In July 2013, the pilot episode was released online as part of a presentation of in-development shows for the network, partnered with KFC; viewers could vote for their favorite pilot, with the winner being broadcast on August 26, 2013. The series lost to √úbermansion, a Stoopid Buddy Stoodios production, although the presentation as a whole won an Internet Advertising Campaign Award in 2014 for \\"Best TV Integrated Ad Campaign\\". The pilot was later published on the network's website on January 23, 2014, and on YouTube on March 10 of the same year, becoming viral with over 700,000 views after roughly a month later. A second season was mentioned at the 2014 Comic- Con. Aaron Simpson of Cold Hard Flash called the series an amalgamation of Lassie and Superjail!, while observing some social commentary \\"to ensure this is more than just a multi-episodic sketch.\\" Mike Hale of The New York Times labeled it \\"the less tasteful but more mainstream\\" counterpart to Tim & Eric's Bedtime Stories, another addition to the network. He wrote that the show was \\"more grisly than funny,\\" but predicted it to have a cult following and that Shields' voice would add \\"surreal-pop-culture cachet\\".

At the age of 11, Nakamura met Cody Horne, one of his classmates at the Bunka High School, who was an exchange student from the UK. Through Horne, Nakamura became interested in foreign cultures.

A Jesus piece is a spiritual or religious piece of jewelry that is popular in the Hip-Hop community and depicts the face of Jesus. Many Hip-Hop artists and celebrities, including The Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, Kanye West among others, have adopted the Jesus piece as a common fashion accessory and have them decorated with many precious gems. Cheaper Jesus pieces have also been sold in other materials including wood and inexpensive metals. Traditional medals in Western Christianity that are worn as necklaces have depicted the Holy Face of Jesus. The Boombox wrote in 2018 that \\"the Jesus piece has arguably become one of the most iconic pieces of jewelry in hip-hop\\" while Highsnobiety penned in 2017, \\"the Jesus piece has arguably become the most popular pendant of all time\\". History =The Notorious B.I.G.= The origination of the Jesus piece is attributed to Christopher Wallace (The Notorious B.I.G.) and Tito Caicedo, Wallace's jeweler. Wallace paid Tito approximately $10,000 a piece for multiple Jesus pieces that he would give to those he worked with and wear himself. The Jesus pieces were decorated with precious gems, specifically on the hair of Jesus. =Jay-Z= When Wallace died in 1997, his Jesus piece was given to his son Christopher Wallace, Jr. \\"CJ\\". Jay-Z would then wear the Jesus piece multiple times for whenever he would record a new album. Two years after Wallace's death, Jay-Z appeared on the December 1999 issue of the XXL magazine with a Jesus piece. Jay-Z wrote in his book, Decoded, the importance of Wallace's Jesus piece; \\"It's part of my ritual when I record an album: I wear the Jesus piece and let my hair grow till I'm done\\". =Kanye West= West wearing multiple Jesus pieces in 2009.

It is a pest of plants in the families Cactaceae, Apiaceae, and Euphorbiaceae. History Cactodera cacti was first discovered in 1932 affecting various species of cactus. It gained wider attention after it appeared in Belle Glade, Florida in the 1960s when it was discovered to have infected the roots of celery plants in greenhouses. It was believed that the parasite had spread due to the popular demand of cactus plants in gardens allowing the nematodes to easily spread to the other plants in the greenhouses.http://www.freshfromflorida.com/content/download/10985/142201/nem197.pdf Recently there have been reports of C. cacti emerging in various greenhouses across parts of Northern China. Distribution In the United States the Cactus Cyst has been reported in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, and New York. It also ranges across parts of South America, Central America, Europe, and Asia. As C. cacti feeds off the roots of plants they mainly target plant species with either fine root systems, like cactus and succulents, or taproot plants that store large amounts of nutrients within their roots, like carrots, parsley, and celery. Life Cycle C. cacti reproduces sexually, although there is evidence that it is also able to reproduce asexually. Females develop eggs within a tough protective cyst which is formed from the body of the female nematode via a process of polyphenol tanning. Each cyst will contain hundreds of eggs and the cysts protect these eggs until they hatch. The eggs can survive without food or water for up to 30 years. The eggs hatch into juvenile nematodes. These juveniles will migrate to roots of a suitable host and remain in the roots of the plant. The nematode will feed from the root whilst they go through their remaining three juvenile stages before moulting into the adult form. Upon maturation the adult female will develop the eggs inside her before dying and forming the protective cyst. Symptoms and Signs Plants that are infected with C. cacti often show signs of dying such as yellowing or dying leaves, wilting, stunted growth, and reduced flower production. Because the parasite attacks the roots of the plant it can also lead to root rot and allow for other parasites and various fungi to infest the plant as well.http://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/Datasheet.aspx?dsid=10668 Prevention The best method to treat nematode infested crops is the rotation of crops by season, as the nematode will not survive without a suitable host. For potted plants or greenhouses it is recommended the soil be changed out or that the roots of the plant be culled before being re-potted into clean soil. Impact C. cacti is not significantly important in regards of an economic loss but can prove problematic in greenhouses, nurseries, and home gardens. In Mexico where cactus plants are often used for food production C. cacti infestations can cause problems for local food production.http://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/Datasheet.aspx?dsID=10668 References Category:Tylenchida Category:Ornamental plant pathogens and diseases Category:Cacti Category:Plant pathogenic nematodes Category:Nematodes described in 1932 ","title":"Cactodera cacti"},{"id":"43371906","text":"Meripilus sumstinei, commonly known as the giant polypore or the black- staining polypore, is a species of fungus in the family Meripilaceae.

Overview  The Sierra Madre Police Department was founded in 1928 when Gordon MacMillan was inaugurated as the first chief of police. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Sierra Madre was praised as the safest city in Los Angeles County while the City of Los Angeles was experiencing a drug fueled crime wave. As of 2014 it continues to be one of the safest cities in the county which crimes trend experts have attributed to inaccessibility and a primarily single-family population. In 2006 the Sierra Madre Police Department made history when their Mayor appointed Marilyn Diaz, the first ever female police chief for Los Angeles County. Five years later, Chief Diaz retired with the support of the Mayor but after conflict between her and the other sworn members of her police department who gave her a vote of no confidence through their police association in 2008.

He was the Executive Chairman Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue and Chief Executive Officer Lagos State Internal Revenue Service. He is the former Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).  Education Dr Babatunde Fowler was born to the family of Professor (Dr) and (Chief) Mrs. W.V. Fowler both of Lagos State. He attended Igbobi College in Lagos and studied in the United States of America at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, where he obtained a bachelor in science in economics and a minor in political Science in 1978. He completed a second bachelor's degree program at California State University, Los Angeles and also a Master of Business Administration degree program at California State University, Dominguez Hills in 1981.  Career  He started out as a Marketing Intern with Avon Products Inc. New York working under the Vice President in charge of Africa. Having completed his formal education he was employed by Johnson and Johnson in New Jersey USA, under the MBA International Development Program lasting one year, thereafter he was transferred to join Johnson & Johnson Nigeria between September 1982 and September 1983. He made a career change from International Finance and Marketing to Banking in January 1984. In the banking industry he had the opportunity to work and also head broad and varied areas of banking operations and business development in 2 major commercial banks over the next 20 years. He joined Commercial Bank (Credit Lyonnais Nigeria Limited) in January 1984, where he was exposed to all aspects of International Banking, Risk Management, and Clearing Operations. Positive reforms were introduced by him as the treasurer of the bank and as a foundation member and trustee of the now Money Market Association of Nigeria. His banking experience at Commercial Bank (Credit Lyonnais Nigeria Limited) concluded with his eventual appointment as the Apapa Branch Manager, the first branch of the bank outside the head office. He left Commercial Bank in March 1990 to join Chartered Bank in April 1990 as a Senior Manager where he spent the last 14 years in the banking industry. His initial posting was as Head of Branch Network during which he successfully grew the bank‚Äôs branches from 2 to 11 branches spread over the country within the first 5 years. He was also in charge of revenue collections for both State and Federal agencies, which he grew, placing the bank amongst the top 3 banks in all collections. He was able to prove himself as a seasoned banker and administrator until he left the organization as a General Manager in March 2004. Dated 10 August 2017, UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guteress, announced the appointment of 25 members in the United Nations Economic and Social Council notification. Mr. Tunde Fowler, was elected as 1st Vice Chairman of United Nations Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters. The 25 tax experts were headhunted across the globe to sit on the Committee and proffer solutions to issues on international taxation and cooperation.  Public service Upon leaving the banking industry in 2004, Fowler joined the Lagos State Government and was appointed permanent secretary/executive chairman of the Lagos State board of internal revenue on November 24, 2005, thereby upgrading the office of the executive chairman to the highest level in the civil service. The Board of internal revenue became autonomous and self-accounting with the passage into law in January 2006 of the Lagos State Revenue Administration Law (The first Revenue Board to become autonomous in Nigeria) and Fowler was appointed as the first CEO of the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service and executive chairman of the Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue. With this re- engineering, the new Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue has achieved the following within 8 years between 2006 and 2013 :A sharp increase in Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) from an average of N 3.6 Billion per month in January 2006 to an average of over N20.5 Billion per month in 2014, improved quality of service delivery to taxpayers, improvement in the use of IT and other modern methods of tax administration, an enlightenment campaign on tax administration and education in Africa. These reforms have made Lagos State the only state in the Federal Republic of Nigeria that is financially independent of the monthly financial allocation of revenue from the federation account and also the only state that generates internally more revenue than the monthly allocation from the federation account. Declining tax revenues since 2015, a lavish lifestyle, and whispered accusations of outright corruption were suspected to be behind the announcement on 9 December 2019 of President Muhammadu Buhari decling to renew his appointment as Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).  Advocacy  Fowler has remained a vocal voice against Nigeria's over-dependence on oil revenue. The position was reiterated by him at an international conference where he warned the Federal Government of Nigeria that the \\"drastic drop in revenue had a negative impact on the balance in the federation account and by extension the amount accruing to the three tiers of government (in Nigeria) during the year 2009\\". In stimulating interest and raising awareness on tax education at an early stage in life, Fowler introduced a competition for pupils which is funded by his board in which winners are given cash awards and scholarships.

To reduce the time needed in the repair caf√©, people might choose to use a pre- made part from a website with 3D models (skipping the scanning step),Examples of such websites are Thingiverse, CGTrader, GrabCAD, and Google 3D Warehouse or make the 3D model themselves by taking many photographs of the part and using something like 123D Catch, and/or choose (in the event the repair caf√© does not have its own 3D printer) to have the 3D model made in the repair caf√©, but printed using a 3D printer elsewhere. Alternatively a 3D printing service like Ponoko, Shapeways, and others can be used, and a person then return to the repair caf√© to have the new part fitted to the broken equipment.

Post Bellum is a Czech educational nonprofit organization based in Prague. The organization was formed in 2001 by a group of historians and journalists with the aim of increasing public knowledge of the 20th century history of the Czech Republic and neighboring countries, especially among younger generations. Post Bellum has collected thousands of witness accounts by conducting interviews with people who lived through significant periods in history as part of their documentation project, Stories of the 20th Century, and for their online archive, Memory of Nations. They organize various other projects and activities to raise awareness of modern history. The stated aim of the organisation is to \\"understand the past through authentic testimony\\". Post Bellum is an associate member organization of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience.  Memory of Nations  The organisation has created an archive of oral historical testimony entitled Memory of Nations, in partnership with the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes and Czech Radio. The archive is the largest online collection of testimonies in Central Europe, documenting the stories of \\"war veterans, Holocaust survivors, political prisoners, as well as members of the Communist Party, the Secret Police, and the People‚Äôs Militias\\". Witnesses are interviewed in their original language, then translated into English. The interviews are then archived online, where they can be browsed using different categories, dates, places, and so on, in order to locate anecdotes and interviews regarding specific events. Initially, Czech Radio provided the technical support to carry out the interviews and witness recordings, and the organisation later began using Eye Direct technology to record the testimonies. As of July 2018, there are 8281 witnesses in the database and 4499 published witnesses, as well as over 60,000 images. Notable people who have provided testimony for the database include Zde≈àka Deitchov√°, Augustin Bubn√≠k, V√°clav Havel, Helga Ho≈°kov√°-Weissov√°, Milan Kn√≠≈æ√°k, Franti≈°ek Zahr√°dka, Felix Kolmer, and Rudolf Bereza. Post Bellum also developed an app, Memory of Nations Sites, with an interactive map allowing users to access archive materials from the 20th century related to their current location. The app is available in English and Czech, and won the Vodafone Foundation Prize in 2012 for the \\"Best Application Idea.\\" = The Memory of Nations Awards = Memory of Nations Award ceremony in 2011.The Memory of Nations Award is awarded to five recipients each year, since 2010, in recognition of bravery in standing up to totalitarian regimes. Recipients are chosen from among 20 nominees by a panel of judges from the fields of historical research, journalism, and politics. The ceremony takes place each year on 17 November, the anniversary of the beginning of the Velvet Revolution, and is broadcast live on television. Each year, the award ceremony has a different theme. In November 2014, the award was presented to people involved in resistance to the Iron Curtain in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Germany, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the fall of communism in Europe. = The Run for Memory of Nations = The Run for Memory of Nations is an annual long- distance run organised to remember and honour Holocaust victims, political prisoners, veterans, and dissidents. Stories from the 20th Century Stories from the 20th Century is a radio show telling witnesses' stories from Post Bellum's Memory of Nations archive, that has aired every Sunday since 2006 on Czech Radio. The people interviewed include war veterans, Holocaust survivors, political prisoners of Nazi and Communist times, and members of minority groups. Stories from the 20th Century was also the name of a documentary series that aired on Czech Television, focused on life during Normalization. The series featured interviews with StB agents, miners, members of the Communist party, gay people, and black market currency dealers.  Educational initiatives  Open Air Exposition opening organised in 2009 by Post Bellum in Prague. Post Bellum is involved with a number of initiatives aimed at increasing public knowledge of totalitarian regimes, especially among young people. They use witness testimonies as part of workshops in schools in which students are encouraged to think critically about historical events, as well as \\"Experience Workshops\\", which involve immersion in historical events and students participating in role plays of events from the mid-1900s and the Normalization period. Another educational initiative is \\"Our Neighbors‚Äô Stories\\", a program in which students record witness testimonies locally, which are then retold through radio or TV. Students also carry out research into the witnesses' situations which is presented together with the testimony. Post Bellum has also published a number of educational books such as We Are Still At War and Forced Labour, graphic novels based on true stories of people affected by totalitarian regimes.  Other activities  Replica of Mauthausen Concentration camp in Charles Square, Prague, 2012. Post Bellum has also documented witnesses in other parts of the world, such as the United States, Poland, and Israel. They have partnerships with the Visegrad Fund and the German Foundation Remembrance, Responsibility and Future (EVZ) to record witness testimonies, and have also begun a partnership with Florida International University to document the testimonies of Cuban dissidents.

The Gulf Rangers program was created to empower local youth to preserve the sea environment and prevent further damage. The program curriculum develops the teenagers' sense of social responsibility through a combination of education and activism. After training, they are ready to become environmental leaders in their home community. Objectives Goal The ultimate goal of the Gulf Rangers program is to engage youth and the local community in the protection and preservation of the Gulf of Eilat for future generations to enjoy. Each year, between 40-60 youths aged 14‚Äì18, from Eilat and the neighboring Arava region, register for the program. Today there are about 500 graduates of the Gulf Rangers program. The program is run by Mori Chen, a Society for the Conservation of the Red Sea Environment board member. Youth volunteering with the Gulf Rangers program take part in environmental trainings, including a certified diving course. This after school program consists of diving tuition, lectures, and presentations. Participants learn about the Red Sea, the environment, and the importance of recycling. Rangers also tour outdoor areas with experts who teach about the environment of Eilat and the Arava. The educational curriculum is designed to build individual's commitment to the environment and develop teamwork skills that serve the group in their community activities. Community Gulf Rangers spearhead environmental activities that contribute to the sustainability of the Red Sea. Once a month, equipped with red trash bags, the group participates in organized clean-up dives into the Red Sea. They spend up to an hour clearing the sea bed and corals of cigarette butts, plastic bags, glass bottles, soda and beer cans, ice-cream wrappers, debris, tires, and more. After each dive, the group gathers to sort the garbage. Municipality workers then take it away to disposal and recycling facilities. The Rangers remove approximately 300 kilos of trash from the Red Sea every year. Rangers also clean up wadis (ephemeral river beds) around Eilat. By doing this, they prevent trash and contamination channeling into the Red Sea. Rangers regularly participate in community environmental campaigns. They also patrol Eilat's beaches at weekends to teach the local community and tourists about environmental issues and threats to the sustainability of the Red Sea. As part of the program, Rangers become role models and mentors, teaching Eilat's elementary school children about recycling and their clean-up activities. Awards The Gulf Rangers program has gained the personal commendation of the city's mayor, Meir Yitzhak Halevy. In 2013, the group won the Negev Prize for the Environment and in 2014 was shortlisted for the Yediot Ahronot Green Heroes award.

Pepper competes in the S14 disability category in freestyle and breaststroke. He represented Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, and in 2010 he won two gold medals at the World Championships in Eindhoven. Swimming career Pepper began swimming at the age of four, as his parents were concerned about the canal that backed onto their home and wanted him to be able to swim. From practising in his local pool in Stockport he was spotted by the local swimming club and was invited to join. As Pepper has a learning disability similar to a dyslexia he was given an S14 parasport classification. His disability effects his ability to both retaining instruction and his co- ordination. Pepper had hopes that the times he was recording would make him eligible for the British team at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, but after the basketball controversy at the 2000 Games, his classification was dropped from all events by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Pepper's initial reaction was one of anger and he decided to quit the sport, but a month later his coach persuaded him to return to training. In 2009 the IPC decided to lift the ban on S14 entrants and Pepper was able to enter his first major international event, the 2009 IPC Swimming European Championships in Reykjavik, Iceland. There he entered three events, the 100m freestyle, 100m breaststroke and the 200m individual medley, taking gold in all three. The following year Pepper travelled to Eindhoven to represent Britain at the 2010 IPC Swimming World Championships entering two events. In the 100m breaststroke he recorded a time of 1:11.08 to take gold, a feat he repeated in the 200m freestyle making him a double world champion. He followed this in 2011 with his second European Championship, this time in Berlin. He failed to defend his 100m breaststroke, coming second to take silver, but victory in the 200m Freestyle gave him his fourth European Championship gold. With the coming of the 2012 Summer Paralympics it was announced that several S14 events would be included in the swimming schedule for the first time. Pepper was part of the Great Britain team and was selected for two events, the 200m freestyle and the 100m breaststroke. Pepper swam in heat 1 of the 200m freestyle. As it was the inaugural race of this event under the S14 classification, by coming first with a time of 2:01.94, Pepper, by default, became the Paralympic champion. His reign was short lived as his time was beaten by Iceland's Jon Margeir Sverrisson in the very next heat. In the final Pepper was unable to improve on his first round heat time and finished seventh. In the breaststroke he was again placed in the first heat. Pepper finished third in a race which saw Russia's Artem Pavlenko set a new World record. As one of the slowest qualifiers, Pepper was placed in the unfavorable first lane and again finished seventh. In 2013 Pepper returned to represent Great Britain, travelling to Montreal to compete in the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships. He swam in two events taking the silver in 200m individual medley.

Hence, there are two hypothetical parts separated from one each other - first five songs, which have never been published before and three songs at the end of the album. Between these two parts there is one song which provides smooth overall impression of album story. Artwork The artwork of the album was created by Jakub Filip, the drummer. At first, it was simply drawn on paper and after that these complete sketches was digitized on computer by using graphic programs. It was made by Kristina Hulvakova, a girlfriend of guitarist Robert Ruman.

This Asiatic-blooded ruler is traditionally placed in the Sixteenth Dynasty, an hypothesis still in use nowadays by scholars such as J√ºrgen von Beckerath;Nubwoserre Ya'ammu on Eglyphica.de although recently Kim Ryholt proposed him as the second ruler of the 14th Dynasty. Identification This ruler seems to have made little use of the cartouche ‚Äì which was a pharaonic prerogative ‚Äì since it was used only for the throne name, Nubwoserre, though not always. His personal name never appears inside a cartouche, and is simply reported as \\"the son of Ra, Ya'ammu\\". Similar to his suggested predecessor Yakbim Sekhaenre, there is no direct evidence that Ya'ammu's throne name was Nubwoserre: the association is based on stylistic features of the seals and was proposed by William Ayres Ward and later elaborated by Ryholt; Daphna Ben-Tor disputed this identification, pointing out that the seals of the many rulers living during this period are too similar to make such correlations on the basis of mere design features. The Turin King List can not help with this issue since the ruler does not appear on it, likely due to a lacuna. Assuming that Ward and Ryholt were right, Nubwoserre Ya'ammu is attested by 26 rather crude scarab seals (more precisely, 19 naming Nubwoserre and 7 naming Ya'ammu);King Ya'ammu on Digitalegypt based on that, Ryholt estimated for him a reign length of around ten years, in the interval 1780‚Äì1770 BCE. However, about the events of his reign absolutely nothing is known. Israeli Egyptologist Raphael Giveon identifies Ya'ammu with his proposed predecessor Yakbim.

It is the first feature film directed by Dreyer and it is an adaptation of the 1884 novel Der Pr√§sident by Karl Emil Franzos.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film:  Plot  The film tells a story of women seduced and abandoned over four generations. It follows three periods in the life of Karl Victor von Sendlingen, a Danish aristocrat living in a small city at the turn of the 20th century. The chronological narrative is interrupted by flashbacks recalling past events. The film starts on the last day in the life of Karl Victor's father, Franz Victor von Sendlingen. Franz Victor takes his son to the ruins of the old family castle where he confesses how as a young man he had made pregnant the porter's daughter and was forced by his father Rigsherre von Sendlingen to marry her. Before dying, he asks Karl Victor to swear on the family coat of arms that he will never marry a commoner, \\"as no good ever comes from such an alliance\\". Thirty years later, Karl Victor, now the president of the tribunal of his home-town, comes back home from a long absence. He is welcomed at the station by Vice-President Werner, who has replaced him during his absence. When is given the list of pending cases, he sees recognises the name of Victorine Lippert, accused of infanticide. When her lawyer, Georg Berger, who is his best friend, comes to discuss her case, he tells him that she is his daughter. As a young man, he had an adventure with her mother Hermine Lippert, the governess of his uncle's children. When he had told his uncle that he wanted to marry her, he had reminded him of the oath made to his father never to marry a commoner. He had kept his oath even after learning eventually that she had given birth to a baby girl. Karl Victor refuses to chair the tribunal when her case is heard, to keep intact his honour as a judge. During the trial, Berger asks for clemency because of the circumstances of the case. An orphan at 17, Victorine when to work as a governess for a heartless lady whose son seduced her. When he heard she was pregnant, he wrote a letter to his mother asking her to deal with the situation in the best possible way. The lady threw Victorine out of her castle in the middle of the night and she was found on the side of the road the next morning, unconscious and with her dead infant next to her. Victorine is nevertheless sentenced to death by the tribunal chaired by Werner. Karl Victor goes to see her in her cell with Berger. She agrees to see him because her mother had asked her to tell her father, if she ever was to see him, that she had forgiven him. Karl Victor presents a petition for clemency. A few weeks later, he learns that the request is rejected and that he is promoted to another city. He organises, with his servants Franz and Birgitta, Victorine's escape during the banquet offered to thank him for his exemplary tenure as president of the city's tribunal. Before leaving the town to escape to a neighbouring country, he writes a letter tendering his resignation for health reasons. Three years later, on a boat trip abroad, Berger meets Weyden, a plantation owner from Java. When the boat stops at Weyden's destination, Berger recognises on the pier Victorine and her father who have come to welcome him. He asks Franz, who has come aboard to carry Weyden's luggage, to tell Karl Victor that he will always remember him with love and respect. The following Sunday, Victorine and Weyden are married at the village church. The following day, Karl Victor goes back home and confesses to Werner, now president of the tribunal, that he had organised Victorine's escape. Werner refuses to have him punished as the revelation of his crime would undermine confidence in the judiciary. When Karl Victor threatens to make a public confession, Werner tells him that if he does, he will find his daughter to have her sentence executed. During the following night, after writing his will, Karl Victor goes to the ruins of the old family castle to kill himself.

He has a brother named Sh≈çd≈ç (Â∞ÜÂ†Ç) three years younger than him who has Down syndrome; Koyama says their parents strove to raise them equally.

As a broadcasting student at the Nihon University College of Art, he began working under Yasuji Hayashi of Nippon Cultural Broadcasting. Hayashi, who found him an \\"interesting character\\", asked Koyama to begin writing scripts for broadcast. In Koyama's third year he branched out into television screenwriting, making his debut with the late-night show 11pm. Continuing this screenwriting after graduation, Koyama began getting attention for his work on Fuji Television's Kanossa no Kutsujoku (1990-1991), a late- night show which \\"took various modern-day social phenomena and products and explained them satirically by presenting them as historical events and folklore\\". Koyama later wrote Nippon Television's Susume Denpa Shonen, and Fuji's Iron Chef. In 2003 he wrote an International Emmy Award-nominated series, The Perfect Manual. In 2008 Shochiku hired Koyama to adapt 's autobiographical ; this was Koyama's first venture in the feature film industry.

Both editions are in Greek from the publishers Ella Publisher, Larissa and Alfeios Books, Athens, Greece, respectively. The book is about a sanatorium created by Greek political exile prisoners in Greece during the Greek Civil War, 1947-1949, on the island of Ikaria, in the Aegean Sea. Background In October 1944 the Greek mainland was liberated from the Germans and Italians and the occupiers left Greece. (The Germans held out another year in the Greek islands). The Greeks who had fought against the occupying forces were organized in the resistance movement ELAS, which was a Communist-led, but where a wide spectrum of Greeks from different political colors were represented. There was another resistance movement, EDES, also that was a nationalist resistance movement. The British and the Russians supported the resistance movement. There were also Greeks who supported the occupiers, the so-called collaborators. Partisans from the resistance movement had liberated most of Greece when the British occupied the major cities. All were relieved and happy that the war was over. The Greek government and the Greek army returned from Cairo in Egypt, where they had gone into exile in the beginning of the war to escape the Germans. Quite right on the return fightings started between the government backed by the British and ELAS, in the major cities in Greece including Athens, on who would actually rule in Greece. After a while it was agreed that democratic elections would be held. In Varkiza just outside Athens a meeting was held and the parties agreed that the resistance would hand in their weapons and free elections would be held, known as the Treaty of Varkiza, that was signed on 12 February 1945. Unfortunately that did not happen, leftists were harassed, arrested and shot because the government together with the British were worried that the communists would win the election. The Communists had a lot of goodwill for having fought against the Germans and Italians. The western forces were worried that Stalin and the Soviet Union would gain influence in Greece. Although one had the Yalta agreement, where Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin had agreed that Greece would belong to the west, but it did not help. A bloody civil war started with the partisans in the mountains against the government, aided by the British. The Cold War had begun. Island of Ikaria Ikaria is located 142 nautical miles east of Athens quite close to the Turkish coast. The island is 225 km¬≤ and very rocky but green. There are around 8000 inhabitants there. One curiosity is that it belongs to one of the five so- called blue zones in the world where people are getting very old. One of three Ikaria islanders gets older than 90 years The Guardian, The island of long life, May 31 2013, .. The island was named Ikaria from the mythological figure Icarus who along with his father, the inventor Daedalus made wings to fly with of feathers and pasted them together with wax. His father warned Icarus to fly too close to the sun because the wax will melt and Icarus will crash. The son did not listen to his father and crashed near the island and then the island became named Ikaria. The Book: The Sanatorium of the deported at Ikaria  Dimitris Dalianis (the author) was arrested in the spring of 1948, in Athens for illegal left winged activities together with several thousand other supporters of ELAS. Several of these were shipped off into exile to remote islands to be more easily controlled and to not join the partisans in the mountains who fought against the government. During the Greek civil war 1947-1949 it is estimated that over 10.000 political prisoners were exiled at the island of Ikaria. Dimitris Dalianis was shipped in July 1948 from Pireus on a ship that contained 120-150 political prisoners who were to be deported to Ikaria. They were handcuffed in pairs for not escaping. The guards were armed with submachine guns. Suddenly a major storm starts and Dimitris Dalianis became very worried that the ship would be wrecked and they would all drown. He noted that the handcuffs he had was a little too large for his arm wrist and that if he pressed his hand through he might be free. He succeeded with great effort and great pain push himself free, his hand was bleeding and had a very sore hand. Suddenly a prisoner became ill and unconscious, someone called out - \\"A doctor, quick.\\" Dimitris Dalianis ran over there and could successfully make the prisoner conscious again, finally the captain gave orders that all prisoners' handcuffs were opened, as there was a risk that the boat would be wrecked in the storm and he did not want the responsibility that they drowned handcuffed. After a day on the boat, they arrived at the port city Evdilos on the island of Ikaria. The prisoners were housed there for overnight accommodation. After a few days, he meets the person responsible for exiled prisoners. The commander, who was a young attorney said. - \\"Dr. Dimitris Dalianis I have an important mission for you, I heard you've been tuberculosis (TB) doctor at Sotiria hospital Sotiria hospital in Athens, the first public sanatorium in Greece, founded in 1903, photon, in Greek in Athens during the entire occupation, and have very good knowledge about the treatment of TB.\\" There are many tuberculosis sick exile prisoners in poor condition with high fever and coughing blood here on the island. They have been isolated in a deserted monastery named Panagia tou Monte (Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒπŒ¨ œÑŒøœÖ ŒúŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒ≠).Panagia tou Monte (Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒπŒ¨ œÑŒøœÖ ŒúŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒ≠) monastery, 1948, Vasilis Leuotsakos second from left, lower row, ] We do not want them to infect other prisoners, the islanders or the guards. The commander was only interested in isolating the sick prisoners to not become infected themselves, not of therapy to make the sick prisoners healthy. From Evdilos they went to the monastery first with a small boat and then by foot to the nearby village Raches and then with a mule to the monastery itself. The monastery was in a miserable condition, the roof leaked, there were no doors and windows, the sick, the prisoners lay directly on the floor and was in very poor condition. When they saw Dr. Dimitris Dalianis and found out that he would take care of them began their faces shine with hope. They knew that they had been left at the monastery to die, and now perhaps they could get treatment and have a chance to survive. Dimitris Dalianis was ordered to check up the presence of all the prisoners twice a day. The authorities feared that the prisoners would escape and join the partisans on Ikaria or on the nearby island of Samos, where the civil war was still raging. Dimitris Dalianis consulted the local doctor Dr. Tsantiri in the nearby village of Raches and quickly realized that they needed to get medical equipment and extra rations of food because tuberculosis patients, first of all, needed good nutrition to survive and be healthy. Dimitris Dalianis managed to arrange that the Red Cross send condensed milk and rice to the sick prisoners. The commandant of the island told Dimitris Dalianis that he would take care of the sick prisoners himself. Dimitris Dalianis protested that he could not take care of 60 sick prisoners himself. He needed help from more staff. The commandant said he could not get it. To get more staff Dimitris Dalianis solved it clever by calling in sick healthy prisoners who he knew had medical knowledge, including several professional nurses and a medical student Vasilis Leoutsakos and some strong young prisoners who could help with all the heavy work at the sanatorium needed to be done as chopping wood, cooking, repairing the broken monastery, tight roof, repair windows and doors and woodwork furniture, including beds that were missing. Dimitris Dalianis knew it was very risky to take sick healthy prisoners, a doctor from Athens would quickly reveal him and he knew the consequences it could have. Torture, execution or at best in prison with even harsher regime. = Patient records = Dimitris Dalianis needed an archive to write up how the treatment is continued, one needed to write medical records but they had no paper to write on. Someone came up with the idea to use cigarette box paper. The journals began to be written in cigarette box paper. A few prisoners had their x-rays with them. The x-rays became part of the patient record. = Terror = Dimitris Dalianis took up the presence of the prisoners but often came warders by to themselves take up presence and to torment and mistreat prisoners. Prison guards used to beat the bell to gather the prisoners but many were in such bad post that they could not go themselves, and it made the warders extra angry and attacked those who could walk and of course the staff who took care of the prisoners. One of the prison guards especially one of the officers enjoyed torturing prisoners especially those with high education. One of the officers hit the doctor Dimitris Dalianis with a club. Intimidation, profanity, threats, to execute him, suddenly, another officer says, \\"Let me execute him.\\" He saves Dimitris Dalianis by taking him away to insult and pretend to beat him. Dimitris survived but he was in pretty poor condition. Vasilis Leoutsakos, medical student, writes in a chapter in the book that still when he hears a clock strike, he gets the chills because it is so connected with beatings from guards. = Vasilis Leoutsakos, the medical student = Vasilis Leoutsakos, the medical student, writes a chapter in the book where he describes Dimitris Dalianis charisma and enthusiasm that all patients be lit up, thinking they will survive their TB under these bad conditions. Vasilis Leoutsakos learns a lot during this time and thanks to Dimitris Dalianis French medical books manages to complete his medical training in 16 months when he finally gets released. Later, he becomes a professor of surgery in Athens. = Treatment of TB at the sanatorium = In addition to the hygiene-dietetic treatment, which meant rest and nutritious food one also used pneumothorax as a treatment. Pneumothorax, also called atelectasis, collapse therapy or fumigation of a patient's lungs, meant to allow air into the pleura. The tuberculosis bacterias needed oxygen to survive. When you remove the oxygen the bacteria has difficulties to cope, the lung had a rest, and the patient was able to fight the TB. Dimitris Dalianis needed a pneumothorax machine pneumothorax machine but such was not to find on the entire island of Ikaria, Dimitris Dalianis managed to smuggle out a letter to his wife Mando Dalianis who were in Athens (and had not yet been imprisoned) to arrange that Dimitris Dalianis pneumothorax machine would be sent to the island. Unfortunately, Mando Dalianis did not manage to get the unit sent to Ikaria. Dimitris Dalianis used then instead of a large syringe, partly to puncture the pleura of patients and also suck out pus from the pleura. As tube, he used the sounds hose from his stethoscope. The situation in the sanatorium was very primitive. There was no furniture and the patients lay directly on the floor. But thanks to the treatment and slightly better food several patients became better. Fighting TB was also a question of psychology. But suddenly something very terrible happened, the syringe broke. Dimitris Dalianis became despondent, he had no other syringe except two very small syringes but they could not be used. The prisoners saw the despair on his face several patients became worse when they could not be emptied of each. Someone came in to use a reed (kalami, Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒºŒπ, Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒºŒπ, the Greek firm, heavy variety, almost like bamboo) cut into and assembled to create the vacuum and suck out pus. It worked with some difficulty and treatment of the patients were able to continue successfully. Patients fever disappeared, they stopped coughing blood and was feeling better. During dr. Dimitris Dalianis time as head of the sanitarium none of the patients died. Of the total of 120 patients treated at the sanatorium, only five patients died during treatment. These five deceased patients are buried next to the monastery, one of the deceased is unknown, where it says XŒïŒùŒüŒ£, ŒûŒïŒùŒüŒ£ unknown or stranger in Greek.Cemetery close to Panagia tou Monte (Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒπŒ¨ tŒøœÖ ŒúŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒ≠) Monastery Dimitris Dalianis and his staff did not sleep in the sanitarium because of the risk of infection, but in a detached storage room with two small rooms some distance away. Patients lay together in various convent cells in the monastery, depending at what stage of TBC they had. Those who had some advanced TB was in the same convent cell and those with more severe TBC was in another convent cell, and so on. The monastery was located in a beautiful place, but not far from the village Raches. A forest near the monastery was harvested for wood to repair the monastery's roof, windows, and doors‚Äîand also to make primitive beds. In the beginning, the prisoners lay directly on the floor, but then made the beds. They made the base of twigs of various thickness and the mattresses of ferns. They had no sheets, and so used blankets, bags, and quilts. Near the monastery was also a river where they washed and washed clothes. Dimitris Dalianis and his colleagues had to organize cooking, baking of bread, transportation of food, everything had to be done on site because it was too far to transport the ready food on the mule. Vasilis Leuotsakos describes in his chapter, he marvelled, and was very moved by that some patients with only one functioning lung helping chop and carry wood. All that could were trying to help. = Heating the sanatorium = In the winter it was very cold, they had managed to seal the roof, repair the windows and the doors. Several of the prisoners were carpenters, masons and were skilled craftsmen. They had been given a saw and some tools by the villagers in the adjacent village Raches. The villagers helped as much as they could even though it was dangerous to do so and the patient-prisoners helped with what they could. They had no heating. Someone got the idea to use the cans that were left over from the canned milk. Normally the cans were warmed up directly on a fire to get warm milk. But the heat from the fire made the cans joints made of tin melting, this made it possible to bang out the cans into flat pieces that were 15‚Äì20 cm high, then bowed to the edges so that it could engage in the next piece, a large scissors was also used to cut the metal pieces, and then they got what looked like a bucket that was open at the top. The stove and the seams were sealed with clay. On the open hole at the top, one put an aluminium plate that you could heat a soup or some herbal tea. The stove was keeping the heat perfectly in winter. = Musical instruments = Also described in the book is the manufacturing of various musical instruments, a guitar, balalaika and mandolin. The playing on this instruments along with songs kept the spirits up in exile prisoners. = Aftermath = Dimitri Dalianis was honoured in 1964 with the Greek Red Cross Medal for his efforts in the Greek resistance movement during the occupation of Greece during World War II and in 1983 by The Medical Association of Athens.

It was built between 1898‚Äì1899, replacing a 1793 chapel built by Robert Carr Brackenbury, the founder of Methodism on Portland. The church remains active to date, as part of the Portland Methodist Circuit, alongside Easton Methodist Church. History =Brackenbury's original chapel (1793)= The church stands out prominently as seen from New Ground at Tophill, with Brackenbury House, the former manse, on the left, next to the church. Robert Carr Brackenbury came to Portland in 1791. He purchased a house on the island, and alongside Mr George Smith, began to preach from his own residence. Soon a Methodist following was established. During that same year Brackenbury built a chapel at his expense within Fortuneswell. It opened by 1793, and had 120 members. Brackenbury School, now the Brackenbury Centre, is located next to the church. During 1794 Brackenbury aimed to increase members at Tophill, and purchased a house for use as a chapel within Wakeham. After Brackenbury died in 1818, his wife had the first purpose-built chapel constructed at Tophill in 1825. During the first half of the 19th century, the construction of new schools were essential on Portland, and a Wesleyan School at Fortunewell was built for 200 children in 1841. It opened in May 1845. It took the same name as the chapel, becoming the Brackenbury Day School. =Construction of Underhill Methodist Church (1898‚Äì1899)= The 19th-century construction of Portland Harbour's Breakwaters, and the other associated works, led to a large increase within Portland's population. Brackenbury's chapel had become too small and fallen into a poor condition by this time. It was decided that a new church should be built, and was to be called Brackenbury Memorial Church. The foundation stones were laid in 1898, and the church was completed by 1899. The church cost over ¬£3,200 to build, and was declared open in 1899 for Divine Service on Whit Monday. In 1903 Brackenbury's original chapel was demolished, and the new Wesleyan manse erected on the same site. This was Brackenbury House, located just below the new church. The increasing Methodist population on the island led to the Tophill's Easton Methodist Church being built between 1906‚Äì07. With the outbreak of World War II, Portland was a natural target for German aircraft, due to the importance of island's naval base. On 11 August 1940 the church was damaged by bombing. During the late 1990s renovations were carried out on the church. The church, still active today as part of the Portland Methodist Circuit, has Revd Christopher Briggs as the current minister.

Apart from the commander- general of the entire corps, the title of \\"Agha of the Janissaries\\" was also be borne by the commander of a provincial garrison of Janissaries. Appointment and duties The Agha was chosen by the Ottoman Sultan, but was not necessarily himself a Janissary. To secure the often uncertain loyalty of the corps, Bayezid II () stopped the practice of appointing the sekban-bashi (the commander of the sekban regiments) to the post, and instead nominated a member of his own household to the post. At the same time, Bayezid founded the Aƒüa B√∂l√ºkleri (\\"Agha's Troops\\") regiments, initially as the Agha's personal retinue and a means of controlling the corps; eventually these became regular Janissary units, and by the end of the 16th century there were 61 Aƒüa B√∂l√ºkleri regiments. During the Devshirme system, the Agha was responsible for checking the new recruited boys on arrival at Istanbul for falsifications or missing persons; his subordinates then examined the boys and allocated them either to the palace service or to the Janissary corps. As the Janissaries' political role increased in the early 17th century, from 1641 on the Aghas were once again appointed from among the Janissary corps. Contrary to widespread modern perception of the Janissary corps as a monolithic and rigidly organized entity, the individual regiments (ortas) were not only the primary unit of organization, but also the focus of Janissary corps spirit and loyalty. Except for the commander (√ßorbacƒ± or b√∂l√ºk aƒüa), all officers within each orta were exclusively drawn from and selected by members of the same regiment based on seniority or merit. Thus, while the Janissary Aghas could and did appoint prot√©gƒós and trusted aides to commands and thereby had a measure of influence within the individual regiments, their ability to exercise direct control was limited. In addition, the corps lacked a dedicated military staff, with the Agha assisted only by a few civilian officials. This was not a problem while the Janissaries where a small force of about 1,000 troops, but prohibited any effective operational control once the corps mushroomed to 15,000 and more in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries. The usually brief tenures of the Aghas further contributed to their lack of control over the corps. The Agha of the Janissaries had his own residence, the so-called \\"Agha's Gate\\" (aƒüa kapƒ±sƒ±) next to the Suleymaniye Mosque, overlooking the Golden Horn. As a senior member of the court, with the right of direct and private audience with the Sultan, the Agha was a very influential figure in Ottoman politics, and one of the closest advisors of the Sultan. Along with the Grand Vizier, the Agha of the Janissaries was also responsible for maintaining order in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. The Agha also had prominent ceremonial and protocollary duties; for example, he accompanied the Sultan on his ceremonial visits to the mosques of the capital for the Friday prayer. When the Agha was absent on campaign, his duties were carried out by his deputy, the sekban-bashi, the commander of the 34 sekban regiments, which always remained behind as garrison in the capital.

It is a tronie, a study of facial expression and unusual costume, rather than a commissioned portrait. The display of cleavage was not a common feature of costume seen in public in Hals' time and place. Painting  This painting was catalogued by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote \\"119. THE GYPSY GIRL. B. 41; M. 263 - Half-length; life size. A laughing gipsy girl, seen almost in full face, looks down towards the right. Her brown hair falls on her shoulders. She wears a red bodice over a white chemise which exposes her breast. Yellow flesh-tones. A superb picture.\\"* Hofstede de Groot on The Gypsy Girl; catalog number 119 Hofstede de Groot noticed that the dress of the sitter in this painting is similar to two other paintings by Hals, and he included them on either side of this one (catalogue numbers 118 and 120). This painting was first documented in a Paris sale in 1782 and every Frans Hals catalog after that includes her. In the exhibition catalog for the 1962 show, this painting's entry at #23 states that in a raking light one can see that diagonal strokes were once painted on either side of her breasts, indicating that Hals first made her d√©collet√© less daring. Since Hals usually painted his genre works wet-on-wet in one go, such evidence of discovery while working is perhaps evidence of a certain reservation on Hals's part to make a portrait of a wanton woman, though in his time it was a common subject.Seymour Slive and C.A. van Hees, Frans Hals Exhibition catalog, 1962, #23, The Gypsy Girl, pp 43-44 Song She has not been in any recent international exhibitions however, and was last lent out for the 1962 Frans Hals exhibition in the Frans Hals Museum, where she inspired the Haarlem singer-songwriter Lennaert Nijgh to write a song about her which he called Malle Babbe, misleadingly named after another painting in the same exhibition. Peter Voskuil: Testament. Leven en werk van Lennaert Nijgh, Kats, 2007, The song celebrates the girl's lusty, vibrant sexuality. The raunchy song became a Dutch hit for Rob de Nijs in 1975 and is still immensely popular in versions by different artists. Today the painting is also sometimes referred to as Malle Babbe for this reason. No name has been discovered in the archives, but various art historians have assumed she was a prostitute. There is no real reason to assume the model was a gypsy.

Iligan Workshop Controversy  On August 2019, TJ Dimacali has been wrongfully charged with sexual assault by a fellow of the 2019 Iligan Writer's Workshop, in which Dimacali was a guest speaker. Social media posts alluding to the sexual misconduct charge in national writing workshops started circulating in early August, with some Twitter users naming Dimacali and others from the writing and film community. The alleged victim released a statement through social media on August 5, detailing her recollection of the events. Dimacali has maintained his innocence regarding the controversy, both through public social media posts, and through an affidavit he submitted to the Commission on Human Rights on August 21, 2019, containing his own recollection of events. Investigations into the incident were launched on August 9, 2019 by the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights, and by the Mindanao State University Iligan Institute of Technology as announced in a statement on August 16, 2019. On January 20, 2020, the assistant city prosecutor of Iligan City, Shirly Parmisana-Bisnar, dismissed the case, noting that the sexual act ‚Äúwas voluntary on the part of the complainant, taking into consideration the manner and circumstances surrounding the incident.\\" Parmisana-Bisnar also absolved Dimacali of sexual harassment because the respondent ‚Äúdid not demand, request nor require any sexual favor from the complainant,‚Äù pointing out that during a clarificatory hearing, the complainant \\"was asked whether she was forced, threatened or intimidated by the respondent to do such act and her answer was always in the negative.\\"  Science education work during the 2020 COVID 19 Quarantine  As part of their response to the various quarantines arising from the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the Philippines, the Philippines' Department of Science and Technology tapped Dimacali as writer alongside Jeffrey Hidalgo as film director for their 20-minute \\"TuklaSiyensya sa Eskwela\\" Science education modules.

The invertebrate fauna is as large as it is common to other regions of the world. There are approximately 2 million known species of arthropods, and this number continues to grow. Thus, it is difficult to determine the exact number of Odonata species within particular regions. The following is a list of the dragonflies and damselflies of Sri Lanka. Dragonflies & Damselflies Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Insecta Order: Odonata. Dragonflies are predators. The larvae inhabit water and adults fly near aquatic places. They are diverse in color and shape. There are major 2 types of odonates in the world; they are dragonflies and damselflies. The eyes are closer together in dragonflies, and their wings are held broadly opened from the body. They are robust in nature. In contrast, damselflies are delicately built small odonates, with well separated compound eyes. During rest, they do not expand their wings; the wings are folded over the abdomen or slightly spread. Damselflies are categorized in to Suborder: Zygoptera; and dragonflies into Suborder: Anisoptera. 131 described species within 13 families can be found in Sri Lanka, with three new species in 2016. The 65 endemic species and marked with an asterisk (*). = Suborder: Zygoptera - Damselflies = Damselflies are insect s of suborder Zygoptera in the order Odonata. They are similar to dragonflies, which constitute the other odonatan suborder, Anisoptera, but are smaller, have slimmer bodies, and most species fold the wings along the body when at rest. An ancient group, damselflies have existed since at least the Lower Permian, and are found on every continent except Antarctica. All damselflies are predatory; both nymphs and adults eat other insects. The nymphs are aquatic, with different species living in a variety of freshwater habitats including acid bogs, ponds, lakes and rivers. The nymphs moult repeatedly, at the last moult climbing out of the water to undergo metamorphosis. The skin splits down the back, they emerge and inflate their wings and abdomen to gain their adult form. Their presence on a body of water indicates that it is relatively unpolluted, but their dependence on freshwater makes them vulnerable to damage to their wetland habitats. 64 Damselfly species can be found in Sri Lanka.

Adult dragonflies are characterized by large multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong transparent wings, sometimes with coloured patches and an elongated body. Dragonflies can be mistaken for the related group, damselflies (Zygoptera), which are similar in structure, though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most dragonflies are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies hold the wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen. Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight. Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colours produced by structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. An adult dragonfly eye has nearly 24,000 ommatidia. Dragonflies are predators, both in their aquatic larval stage, when they are known as nymphs or naiads, and as adults. Several years of their lives are spent as nymphs living in fresh water; the adults may be on the wing for just a few days or weeks. They are fast, agile fliers, sometimes migrating across oceans, and are often found near water. There are 65 Dragonfly species can be found in Sri Lanka.

It stars Dominic Purcell, James Caan, Louis Gossett Jr., and Famke Janssen. It was released in Canada on 25 April 2014. Summary Sailor O'Connor is a retired Irish boxer, who has not once been knocked down in the 63 matches he's fought. Sailor's mother Rose is dying of cancer and Sailor wants to take her to Ireland one last time before she passes. After negotiating with Fast Eddie, a local promoter, Sailor secures enough money whether or not he wins. Though a long way from his prime, Sailor convinces his old training team Brother Albright and Max to get into shape for the bout against a younger opponent. A local priest, Father Brennan, tries to convince Rose to have Sailor back out of the fight, to which she says it's up to Sailor. King Solomon is an adult film actor seeking a way out of his current situation. His girlfriend Peg tells him she's pregnant and Solomon wants to live a proper life with her. Formerly an up and coming boxer, and still in his prime, Solomon quits his career in pornography and goes to Cubby, his former boxing coach, promising to stay dedicated to his boxing career. He begins his training for the fight against Sailor. Solomon's mother, a drug user and alcoholic, cannot cope with her son's wanting to leave, and like his father, believes he will be back. Leading up to the fight, Sailor, Rose, Solomon, Father Brennan, and Diane Scheuler, a recovering alcoholic, all attempt to overcome their demons. Diane attempts to ask Sailor several times for forgiveness for some unspoken thing she did to Sailor, and each time he rebuffs her. The fight arrives, and it proves to be a brutal event, with neither fighter showing signs of giving up out of either stubbornness or motivation. Diane and Peg sit together at ringside. As the final round is about to start, Fast Eddie announces a large bonus to either man to call it quits right then and there. Neither take up the offer, so the final round begins. When the final seconds and punches hit, Sailor flashes back to the tragedy in which Diane killed Sailor's wife and two children (and possibly her own children, shown riding with her) in a drunk driving accident. Never knocked down and refusing to give up, a clearly defeated Sailor is shown respect by Solomon, who holds Sailor upright for the dying seconds of the fight. When the final bell rings, the two boxers congratulate each other. King Solomon is declared the unanimous winner of the bout and each man heads to the locker room. As Diane passes by Sailor, he tells her that there may be a way that he may forgive her some time in the future.

The research group consists of researchers devoted to learning more about how people make economic and moral choices, and how governments, corporations and non-governmental institutions can use insights from this research to improve their decision making.  Research topics  The research in The Choice Lab follows three distinct avenues. First, using economic experiments, the researchers study individual decision making, including how people are motivated by moral, risk, time, and institutional considerations. This research includes laboratory experiments with students, representative populations, criminals, and children, conducted in different parts of the world. The research group has also been involved in large scale internet experiments, field experiments, and surveys. Second, the research group studies implications of their experimental findings for important policy issues, including global income inequality, tax policy, and health care, and for management issues relevant to corporations and non- governmental organizations. Third, the research group studies, through axiomatic analysis, the normative justifications for different theories of justice, and how these theories relate to welfare, inequality and poverty measurement issues.  Research output  The research output of the group has been published in top academic journals, including Science, American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, Journal of European Economic Association, Economic Journal, and Journal of Philosophy, as well as in numerous field journals.

A leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, he was Irrigation Minister of Odisha from 1990 to 1995 in the Biju Patnaik cabinet. He was the most powerful minister (known as Super Chief Minister) in Biju Patnaik's cabinet. He was four times MLA from Patkura Constituency of Kendrapara district. He won four straight elections in 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1995. After the completion of his early education at Korua High School, in 1965, Mohapatra received his B.A. degree from Kendrapara College, Utkal University in 1969. He later received his LLB. Political career Mohapatra played an instrumental role in the formation of Biju Janata Dal in 1997 after the demise of Biju Pattanaik. He was one of the founding members of Biju Janata Dal and one of the most powerful leaders in the party. He was the Chairman of the Political Affairs Committee of the party. He was the leader of a group of leaders in the party, and was opposed to many decisions of party President Naveen Patnaik. In 2000, after filing nomination paper for the Odisha Assembly elections of 2000, Mohapatra was busy in parliamentary board meeting of Biju Janata Dal as the chairman of parliamentary affairs committee. In the meantime, Naveen Patnaik as the President of the party, cancelled Mohapatra's ticket and gave it to Atanu sabyasachi Nayak, a journalist who is a son of Ex MLA . Due to lack of time Bijoy couldn't reach to file a new nomination. Bijoy proceeded to support Trilocahan Behera, a candidate of the Trinamool Congress, who won the seat by more than 40,000 votes over Atanu Sabyasachi, the official BJD nominee. The understanding was that Behera would vacate the seat for Bijoy.It is speculated that leaders like Pyarimohan Mohapatra had a role behind the ouster of Bijoy. However, supporters of Mohapatra in the BJD could not get a majority in the BJD legislature party in the 2000 elections. As a result, Navin Patnaik was elected as the leader of BJD legislature Party and a BJD-BJP government came to power in Odisha. After his failure to get the post of BJD legislature party, many of Mohapatra's supporters in the BJD kept mum or even supported Naveen Patnaik. In 2001, Bijoy formed Odisha Gana Parishad, a regional party. A majority of his supporters in the BJD did not join it, though, as they did not want to lose their power. The OGP formed an alliance with the Indian National Congress in the 2004 assembly elections, and got only four seats to contest. The Party won two of these seats, but Mohapatra narrowly lost his bid. Due to financial constraints, Bijoy decided to merge his party with the NCP, and became its head in Odisha. However, before the 2009 elections, Sharad Pawar, NCP National President decided to ally with BJD. In protest, Bijoy resigned from NCP in 2009 and joined BJP. Presently, Mohapatra is a national executive member of BJP. However, due to very poor organisational strength of BJP in coastal Odisha, Bijoy lost the Assembly elections in 2009 and 2014, contesting from the Patkura and Mahakalapada Assembly seats respectively. Despite the setbacks, Mohapatra has decided to stay with BJP for the present. He was selected as the Campaign Committee Chairman of BJP for the Kandhamal Lok Sabha by-election in 2014. Bijoy was sidelined in Odisha BJP since 2016, when Basant Panda was elected as BJP state President. He finally quit BJP on 30 November 2018 but returned again to BJP on 27 March 2019.

It is situated approximately north east of Minnipa and west of Iron Knob in the Gawler Ranges. Yardea was established at some time prior to 1865, and was the first property taken up in the Gawler Ranges. At one time an estimated 80-90,000 sheep were shorn there. In 1865, the station overseer, John Edmondson, was lost in the bush. A police camp was established at Yardea in 1871 after being transferred from the nearby Paney Station homestead. By 1881 the property was owned by Main, Sells and Company, in which year it is recorded they sold 750 head of cattle and 7,000 wethers to A. Wooldridge of Arcoona Station. Main and Sells placed Yardea up for auction along with Wilgena Station in 1882. At that time, Yardea occupied an area of and was stocked with 54,000 sheep. In the early 1890s, the pastoral lease over Yardea expired. The run was deserted from that time. By 1901 the lease was still abandoned like many others in the area, but did have a caretaker. At this time the property was said to encompass an area of only . The Station remained unlet until it was re-established by Andrew Tennant and James Moseley in 1904. James Moseley also acquired Paney Station, and made Paney Station part of Yardea Station. In 1916, the property, now consisting of , was sold to A.J. and P.A McBride after much improving of the property, for a sum of ¬£72,000. At this time it was stocked with 40,000 sheep. In 1926, the McBrides cut the property into five blocks and sold three blocks by auction to Harry Bouily, and the other two to T. H. MacKay & Son of Thurlga Station. In 2000, the State Government purchased the part of Yardea that had been Paney Station and converted it to Gawler Ranges National Park. The land occupying the extent of the Yardea pastoral lease was gazetted as a locality on 26 April 2013 under the name 'Yardea'.

Presently, the RA4 is dependent on the Rapid Reaction Brigade, whose charges towards Operating System Component Forces. History :1917 - The current RA4 was created in Castelo Branco as the Field Howitzers Regiment or ROC (Regimento de Obuses de Campanha) through the integration of the old field howitzer battalions from 5th Artillery Regiment from Viana do Castelo and from the 6th Artillery Regiment from Porto. :1926 - The ROC was transferred to Leiria, being renamed 4th Artillery Regiment or RA4. :1927 - The unit was renamed 4th Light Artillery Regiment or RAL4 (Regimento de Artilharia Ligeira n.¬∫ 4). :1955 - The regiment received the task of organizing the divisional artillery headquarters and two of the three field artillery groups (battalions) of the 3rd Division of the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps, the Portuguese main land forces contribution to NATO. :1961 - With the beginning of the Portuguese Colonial War, the regiment organizes and sends, to Angola, three artillery companies (ca√ßadores type), to act as infantry but composed of military gunners: the 101st, the 119th and the 178th artillery companies. :1963 - The RAL4, while retaining the same name, becomes a training center for military secretariat, especially for personal to be deployed to the Portuguese overseas territories in Africa. :1975 - The unit is renamed Artillery Regiment of Leiria or RAL (Regimento de Artilharia de Leiria). Since 1977, the RAL receives the task of organizing the Field Artillery Group (GAC) of the new 1st Independent Mixed Brigade. For that task it is equipped with 155 mm M109 self- propelled and with M101 towed 105 mm howitzers. :1993 - The unit is again renamed \\"4th Artillery Regiment\\" being responsible for the organization and maintenance of the Field Artillery Group of the Independent Airborne Brigade, equipped with M101 and later with M119 Light Gun howitzers. :2005 - As part of the reorganization of the Portuguese Army, the Rapid Reaction Brigade (ex- Airborne Brigade) ceased to have organic field artillery, and its Field Artillery Group is transferred to the Intervention Brigade (BrigInt). Following this reorganization, given the deactivation of the old BrigInt's artillery unit, the RA4's Field Artillery Group's became the sole towed field artillery operational unit of the Portuguese Army. :2009 - The 5th Artillery Regiment raised a new Field Artillery Group, which is attributed to the BrigInt.

It was founded in 1967. Called \\"the state's most influential environmental organization\\" by Georgia Trend magazine, the Georgia Conservancy focuses on environmental advocacy, land conservation, coastal protection, stream protection, outdoor recreation, stewardship, and growth management. Its mission is: ‚ÄúTo protect Georgia's natural resources for present and future generations by advocating sound environmental policies, advancing sustainable growth practices and facilitating common-ground solutions to environmental challenges.‚Äù The Georgia Conservancy's main office is in Midtown Atlanta. The group also has an office in Savannah, Georgia that focuses on issues affecting the Georgia coast. The group offers stewardship trips and has released guidebooks.  Early Years  The Georgia Conservancy was founded in 1967 after James MacKay, a former U.S. congressman from Decatur, Georgia, gathered a group of Georgians to discuss ways to protect the state's natural resources. The organization was created as a non-partisan body ‚Äúorganized specifically to promote fellowship and good fun among its members‚Äù. The group's earliest conservation efforts were largely focused on protecting endangered places around the state. By 1968, the Conservancy had already begun to influence conservation and planning decisions along Georgia's coasts. Concerned by the link that had been established between automobile emissions and air pollution, leaders within the organization began calling for metro Atlanta to work on its public transit system in 1971. In 1974, The Conservancy celebrated a landmark decision by the Georgia Supreme Court in the ‚Äúbeach case,‚Äù Georgia v. Ashmore, decided in favor of the state and granting it the authority to protect marshes and tidal rivers and guaranteeing public access to all of Georgia's beaches. Also in 1974, the group helped to get the Chattooga River designated as a Wild and Scenic river. The area would later be featured in the hit film Deliverance. Working collaboratively with other groups, both from Georgia and across the nation, The Georgia Conservancy was able to protect four key nature areas around the state only a few years after its foundation. *Sweetwater Creek became a Georgia State Park in 1972 as Sweetwater Creek State Park. *Congress designated Cumberland Island as a national seashore in 1972. *The entirety of The Okefenokee Swamp that was located in Georgia was designated as the Okefenokee Wilderness after the passing of Public Law 93-429, a section from the Wilderness Act of 1974. *The area surrounding Panola Mountain, just outside of metro Atlanta, was designated as a state park in 1980. In 1976, Conservancy champion and charter member Jimmy Carter was elected as president of the United States. In the latter part of the 1970s, the Conservancy utilized advocacy as a means of maximizing its statewide, and, in some cases, national, environmental impact. During the period, the Conservancy's efforts remained focused on Georgia's waterways, including its rivers, creeks and lakes, but also on Georgia's barrier islands and coastal communities. In 2018 the group supported an amendment that would dedicate funds to conservation. Growth in the 1980s and 1990s Working with other organizations across Georgia and the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s, the Conservancy pushed for increased support for threatened species along the coast, greater wetlands protection, the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act, the creation of the Georgia Superfund program, and an environmentally-friendly 1996 summer Olympic Games in Atlanta. In 1993, the Conservancy launched ‚ÄúGreen Peaches‚Äù (known today as Generation Green), an organization for environmentally conscious young professionals. In 1996, The Georgia Conservancy launched its website georgiaconservancy.org. It is still the organization's current web address. The Conservancy's sustainable growth efforts launched in 1998 as part of Smart Growth conference hosted along with the EPA, Urban Land Institute, and the Successful Communities Partners. Present Day The Georgia Conservancy remains focused on advocacy, land conservation, sustainable growth, coastal protection, and stewardship trips. =Advocacy= The Conservancy's advocacy team has decades of experience in state politics and is dedicated to using the political process to help work year-round on key issues such as water resources, habitat protection and land conservation. The group's advocacy program has scored some key successes: The Conservancy was part of the team that worked with then-governor Sonny Perdue and the state Legislature during the 2010 General Assembly to craft and pass the nation's most progressive water conservation law. In 2012, the advocacy team helped to facilitate the permanent protection of Boyle's Island on the Altamaha River. =Land Conservation= The Georgia Conservancy's land conservation program was launched in 2011. The Conservancy believes that land conservation is a key to protecting Georgia's water resources, its plants and animals, and its citizens. The Georgia Conservancy advocates for local, state and federal policies that encourage land conservation. The advocacy team meets with public officials and their staff at all levels of government to secure their support, or to thank them for their support of land conservation funding and legislation. The Georgia Conservancy also works with landowners to encourage them to place their land in permanent protection through conservation easements or through participation in various other state and federal programs that provide financial incentives for land protection. In 2018, Georgia Conservancy worked with officials from Milton, Georgia to prioritize conservation lands including a 109-acre tract set to be protected. =Sustainable Growth= The Georgia Conservancy's Sustainable Growth program works to foster smart, sustainable development across Georgia. The team uses four different programs to accomplish this Blueprints for Sustainable Communities, a program designed to steer cities toward thoughtful land use decisions with regards for both economic interests and preserving the environment. Currently, Blueprints is focused on a multi-year study of sea- rise on Georgia's coast. Blueprints will celebrate its 20th year in 2015. Good Urbanism seminars teach planning professionals, government officials and neighborhood residents about the importance of sustainable growth. School Siting workshops bring together diverse stakeholders to learn more about the EPA's guidelines for school siting. Bantam Towns In The Deep South is an ongoing research project that looks at the hundreds of tiny, rural towns scattered across the Deep South for answers on how they might they be reinvigorated with new economic purpose. =Coastal Protection= The Georgia Conservancy maintains an office in historic downtown Savannah, headed by Coastal Director Charles McMillan, and is working on a range of projects to protect the nearly 100 miles of coastline throughout the state. The organization partnered with the University of Georgia's River Basin Center and the Coastal Resources Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources on a three-year study of the impacts of sea level rise on coastal Georgia. The Georgia Conservancy is a member of the Coastal Georgia Land Conservation Initiative (CGLCI), which works with public and private interests to conserve critical coastal lands and healthy ecosystems while promoting sustainable economic growth and development. =Stewardship Trips= Since 1967, the Georgia Conservancy has been guiding trips across the state that highlight Georgia's natural resources and provide the public with the opportunity to advocate for their protection. The group uses its network of partners and peers to provide public access to barrier islands, river systems and nature preserves that are normally inaccessible or off-limits to the public. What started out as six trips per year for a handful of Conservancy members has grown into a program that now serves hundreds of people each weekend, many from communities of color that have historically not been included in outdoor recreation opportunities. In 2019, The Georgia Conservancy will host more than two dozen stewardship trips and events throughout the state. The trips involve a mixture of service and sightseeing. For the most part, the Conservancy's trips last no more than three days, and are usually on weekends. Many of the trips are family-friendly, as well. Destinations include Sapelo Island along the coast, The Okefenokee Swamp in the southern part of the state, the Chattahoochee River near Atlanta an Ochlockonee River paddle. and People Charles McMillan became the group's coastal director in 2015. Awards Georgia Conservancy presents the Longleaf Award annually. In 2018, at the 10th annual award ceremony, it presented the award to Katherine Kennedy of Concrete Jungle.

From journalism, she moved into a business role during wartime, later advising the British fashion industry and helping to form the London Fashion Group ‚Äì a forerunner to the British Fashion Council. In 1948, she founded the first fashion course at the Royal College of Art, helping to develop a rigorous academic framework with a strong industry focus. Robert O'Byrne described Garland as among the female pioneers who: \\"battled to have fashion design taken more seriously, in particular fighting for academic acknowledgment\\". Garland's obituary in The Times noted: \\"She was no society featherhead, but a key figure in the history of British fashion journalism, the British fashion industry and the training of fashion designers.\\" Early life and career Madge McHarg was born in Melbourne, Australia and was the third child of Andrew McHarg and Henrietta Maria Aitkin. Her father was an international shipper who exported to Australia and she had a peripatetic childhood, growing up in St John's Wood, London and attending the International School in Paris from 1912. It was in Paris that her lifelong interest in fashion, art and literature was developed, however her parents prevented her from taking up a university place at Cambridge and she left home at 21, beginning her career as an errand girl on Fleet Street. This was considered very unusual for the times for a 'lady', especially as Garland was living independently in a boarding house in Earl's Court. Move to Vogue In 1922, she began assisting at Vogue UK, just after the arrival of its second editor Dorothy Todd, who was shifting the magazine's focus away from society and towards the arts, featuring articles by Clive Bell, Aldous Huxley and Virginia Woolf.[Reed, C. (2006). A Vogue That Dare Not Speak its Name: Sexual Subculture During the Editorship of Dorothy Todd, 1922‚Äì26. Fashion Theory: The Journal of Dress, Body & Culture, 10(1/2), 39‚Äì71.] Initially, Garland was a receptionist and teagirl, also teaching herself to type. She was married briefly during this period to Captain Ewart Garland but retained the name McHarg until Gertrude Jekyll told her it was dreadful and asked if she had another. From then on, she adopted her former husband's name. Describing how she got started, she said: \\"I don't want to sound snobbish, but I wore extremely good and fashionable clothes...I remember Aldous Huxley saying: 'Are you dressed like that because you are on Vogue or are you on Vogue because you are dressed like that?'\\". This same talent for looking the part gained Garland access straight into the drawing room of Lady Bowes-Lyon ‚Äì then about to announce her engagement to the Duke of York ‚Äì to deliver some photographic proofs from Vogue; Garland had taken the precaution of arriving by taxi in a Bergdorf Goodman coat. Over time, she became the proteg√© of Todd and the two also developed a relationship and shared a flat. It appears their love affair was widely recognised in some circles as it inspired a parody of Thomas Edward Brown's poem The Garden, which ran: 'A Garland is a lovesome thing, Todd wot'. During this time, Garland developed both her journalism skills and connections with leading writers and artists of the day, such as Rebecca West and Ivy Compton-Burnett ‚Äì also advising Virginia Woolf on what to wear. Woolf recounted in her diary a dinner party at Todd and Garland's flat in Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea, also attended by West, in which Todd wore sponge bag trousers and Garland wore pearls and silk. Many years later (in response to Garland's obituary), the author Nesta Macdonald reported on another party co-hosted by Garland and held at her flat in Royal Hospital Road in 1927. A fan of the Diaghilev Ballet (Ballets Russes), which had just revived Les Matelots, this was a fancy dress party with guests required to dress in nautical costumes. Among those attending were Lytton Strachey and Tallulah Bankhead. She introduced Cecil Beaton to Vogue and was photographed by him in 1927 ‚Äì the photograph is now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Man Ray ‚Äì who also photographed Garland ‚Äì and George Hoyningen-Huene were also among Garland's friends and she brought them into the magazine. Todd's tenure as Vogue editor lasted four years, but the magazine was losing money and its owner Cond√© Nast disliked the literary approach. The publisher sacked Todd, who threatened to sue; Cond√© Nast in return threatened to expose her 'morals'. Garland left with her, becoming a successful freelance writer. She contributed to the influential US fashion trade title Womenswear Daily, as well as writing the women's section of Illustrated London News between 1928‚Äì32 and contributing to Eve and Britannia magazines. Garland returned to Vogue in 1932 as fashion editor, and remained involved with the magazine for the next nine years. She would travel to Paris to report on couture fashions by names such as Lucien Lelong and Jacques Fath, staying at the Ritz and taking advantage of the opportunity to buy sale-price items from Schiaparelli and Chanel ‚Äì she had a mannequin's figure. Fashion industry role During the war, Garland began working for the London department store Bourne & Hollingsworth and was regarded as an excellent businesswoman. She took charge of merchandising and also did some designing herself. She also commissioned Hardy Amies to produce garments when he was on leave from the Special Operations Executive. She began advising the fashion industry, notably helping to form the London Fashion Group, comprising Norman Hartnell, Peter Russell, Victor Stiebel and Edward Molyneux ‚Äì all of whom were members of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers. In this advisory capacity, she went on a government-backed trip to Paris in 1947 (working with the Council for Industrial Design) to buy New Look accessories (gloves, shoes, underwear) that could then be copied by the UK fashion industry. She was armed with ¬£1,000 to make the purchases. She also visited the United States to explore the ready-to-wear industry and its marketing methods. Academic appointment In 1947, Garland was invited to become the first professor of fashion at the Royal College of Art by Robin Darwin, taking up the role a year later. As her Times obituary notes, she had to effectively invent the course ‚Äì creating an academic framework that would serve the industry. As most of the available art teachers didn't have the required background, Garland brought in teachers from industry, notably cutters from the fashion trade, also liaising with the Manchester textile industry to source materials and designs. Interviewed in 1972, she recalled how much of a struggle it was to convince the powers that be that her decision was right: \\"there was an awful row with the Department of Education. But I wanted people from the trade ‚Äì trade was a dreadful word to use in connection with art. So I formed a committee of very high powered people from industry and drew teachers from the trade...I got the trade to serve on the committee and to give bursaries and do competitions and to take students for a period in the vacations to work in their businesses. I tried so hard to marry art and industry ‚Äì previously there had been no contact, the principals of the art colleges had never been inside a fashion house, they were grey haired and well meaning in those sort of Fairisle smocks.\\" In an interview for the Victoria and Albert Museum, one of her students Gerald McCann ‚Äì later to have a long and successful career in the United States as well as Britain ‚Äì recalled her strong links to industry. He would begin working for Marks & Spencer even before he graduated. Other influential designers trained by Garland included Gina Fratini and David Sassoon. She is also said to have inspired Hardy Amies to set up his first fashion enterprise. Although Garland had created the framework that would train so many post-war designers, she has been, according to the Royal College of Art, somewhat neglected as a figure in the history of fashion. She left the RCA after its first full graduation show in 1956 and was succeeded by Janey Ironside.Last-Year Reads: Janey Last-Year Girl, 2012. Retrieved 23 July 2014. Her resignation was reported in the papers, with Garland expressing the view that, after eight years in academia it was time for a change. The Times noted: \\"one of her most important achievements has been to bring both to students and manufacturers the understanding that fashion design is not by any means restricted to haute couture and to the creation of ball gowns requiring a hundred yards of tulle and a box of sequins\\". Later life and career Garland continued to act as an advisor to industry, working with Terylene and knitwear manufacturers. She was the author/co-author of several books, including The Changing Face of Beauty (1957), The Changing Face of Fashion (1970) and A History of Fashion (1975). A founder member of the Contemporary Art Society, she was herself the subject of portraits by notable artists, including one by Marie Laurencin that she owned, and another by Edward Wolfe that now hangs in the Geffrye Museum. She was cared for in her later years in a convent but would use friends' houses to host parties. She remained close to Rebecca West and Ivy Compton-Burnett and friends continued to consult her about what to wear ‚Äì she accompanied Rebecca West, then aged 87, in search of a mink coat. In an interview for The Observer in 1986, Garland recounted how Compton-Burnett had such implicit trust in her judgement that once sent her off to buy a diamond brooch to go with a new black dress, with Garland duly returning to the flat with three uninsured pieces on trial from a jeweller friend in Bond Street. She also had a friendship with Vita Sackville-West ‚Äì who would lay on enormous teas at Sissinghurst followed by tours of the gardens. Personal life Garland's private life was shrouded in secrecy during her lifetime and subject to some scandal. Lisa Cohen's 2012 book All We Know: Three Lives describes Garland and Todd as life partners. Their relationship is said to have inspired Frederick Ashton's first short ballet A Tragedy of Fashion. Garland's earlier brief marriage ‚Äì described as an escape ‚Äì was to an admirer Ewart Garland. Years later she would recount sending him a telegram from a hospital bed asking him to come and marry her immediately. In 1953, she married Sir Leigh Ashton, an old friend and director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. This has been described as a marriage of convenience, as Ashton was also gay. The marriage was over after a year, but the couple did not divorce until 1962 ‚Äì Garland retained the name Lady Ashton for formal purposes. She had no children.

The crash resulted in the deaths of all people onboard including Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, the second Secretary-General of the United Nations, and 15 others. Hammarskj√∂ld had been en route to cease-fire negotiations with Moise Tshombe during the Congo Crisis. Three official inquiries failed to determine conclusively the cause of the crash, which set off a succession crisis at the United Nations. Incident Flight path of Hammarskj√∂ld's aircraft (pink line) and the decoy (black line), September 1961 In September 1961, during the Congo Crisis, Hammarskj√∂ld learned about fighting between \\"non-combatant\\" UN forces and Katangese troops of Moise Tshombe; on 18 September Hammarskj√∂ld was en route to negotiate a cease-fire when the aircraft he was flying in crashed near Ndola, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Hammarskj√∂ld and fifteen others perished in the crash. The crash set off a succession crisis at the United Nations, as Hammarskj√∂ld's death required the Security Council to vote on a successor. Aircraft and crew Swedish DC-6, similar to the lost aircraft, 1960s The aircraft involved in this accident was a Douglas DC-6B, c/n 43559/251, registered in Sweden as SE-BDY, first flown in 1952 and powered by four Pratt & Whitney R-2800 18-cylinder radial piston engines. It was flown by captain Per Hallonquist (35); co-pilot Lars Litton (29); and flight engineer Nils Goran Wilhelmsson. UN special report A special report issued by the United Nations following the crash stated that a bright flash in the sky was seen at approximately 01:00. According to the UN special report, it was this information that resulted in the initiation of search and rescue operations. Initial indications that the crash might not have been an accident led to multiple official inquiries and persistent speculation that the secretary- general was assassinated. Official inquiry Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, 1950s Following the death of Hammarskj√∂ld, there were three inquiries into the circumstances that led to the crash: the Rhodesian Board of Investigation, the Rhodesian Commission of Inquiry, and the United Nations Commission of Investigation. (direct link: ) The Rhodesian Board of Investigation looked into the matter between 19 September 1961 and 2 November 1961 under the command of British Lt. Colonel M.C.B. Barber. The Rhodesian Commission of Inquiry held hearings from 16‚Äì29 January 1962 without United Nations oversight. The subsequent United Nations Commission of Investigation held a series of hearings in 1962 and in part depended upon the testimony from the previous Rhodesian inquiries. Five \\"eminent persons\\" were assigned by the new secretary-general to the UN Commission. The members of the commission unanimously elected Nepalese diplomat Rishikesh Shaha to head an inquiry. The three official inquiries failed to determine conclusively the cause of the crash that led to the death of Hammarskj√∂ld. The Rhodesian Board of Investigation sent 180 men to search a six-square-kilometer area of the last sector of the aircraft's flight path, looking for evidence as to the cause of the crash. No evidence of a bomb, surface-to-air missile, or hijacking was found. The official report stated that two of the dead Swedish bodyguards had suffered multiple bullet wounds. Medical examination, performed by the initial Rhodesian Board of Investigation and reported in the UN official report, indicated that the wounds were superficial, and that the bullets showed no signs of rifling. They concluded that cartridges had exploded in the fire in proximity to the bodyguards. No evidence of foul play was found in the wreckage of the aircraft.Macarthur Job, Air Disaster Volume 4, Aerospace Publications Pty Ltd, 2001 , p. 142. The Rhodesian Board concluded that the pilot flew too low and struck trees, thereby bringing the aircraft to the ground. Previous accounts of a bright flash in the sky were dismissed as occurring too late in the evening to have caused the crash. The UN report speculated that these flashes may have been caused by secondary explosions after the crash. Sergeant Harold Julien, who initially survived the crash but died days later, indicated that there was a series of explosions that preceded the crash. The official inquiry found that the statements of witnesses who talked with Julien before he died in hospital five days after the crashpage 36 \\"The Spectator\\" 29 October 2011 were inconsistent. The report states that there were numerous delays that violated established search and rescue procedures. There were three separate delays: the first delayed the initial alarm of a possible plane in trouble; the second delayed the \\"distress\\" alarm, which indicates that communications with surrounding airports indicate that a missing plane has not landed elsewhere; the third delayed the eventual search and rescue operation and the discovery of the plane wreckage, just miles away. The medical examiner's report was inconclusive; one report said that Hammarskj√∂ld had died on impact; another stated that Hammarskj√∂ld might have survived had rescue operations not been delayed. The report also said that the chances of Sgt. Julien surviving the crash would have been \\"infinitely\\" better if the rescue operations had been hastened. On 16 March 2015, UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon appointed members to an independent panel of experts to examine new information related to the tragedy. The three-member panel was led by Mohamed Chande Othman, the Chief Justice of Tanzania. The other two members were Kerryn Macaulay (Australia's representative to ICAO) and Henrik Larsen (a ballistics expert from the Danish National Police). The report was handed over to the secretary-general on 12 June 2015. Alternative theories Despite the multiple official inquiries that failed to find evidence of assassination, some continue to believe that the death of Hammarskj√∂ld was not an accident. At the time of Hammarskj√∂ld's death, intelligence agencies of the U.S. and its allies were actively involved in the political situation in the Congo, which culminated in Belgian and United States support for the secession of Katanga and the assassination of former prime minister Patrice Lumumba. Belgium and the United Kingdom had a vested interest in maintaining their control over much of the country's copper industry during the Congolese transition from colonialism to independence. Concerns about the nationalisation of the copper industry could have provided a financial incentive to remove either Lumumba or Hammarskj√∂ld. The involvement of British officers in commanding the initial inquiries, which provided much of the information about the condition of the plane and the examination of the bodies, has led some to suggest a conflict of interest. The official report dismissed a number of pieces of evidence that would have supported the view that Hammarskj√∂ld was assassinated. Some of these dismissals have been controversial, such as the conclusion that bullet wounds could have been caused by bullets exploding in a fire. Expert tests have questioned this conclusion, arguing that exploding bullets could not break the surface of the skin. Major C. F. Westell, a ballistics authority, said, \\"I can certainly describe as sheer nonsense the statement that cartridges of machine guns or pistols detonated in a fire can penetrate a human body.\\" He based his statement on a large scale experiment that had been done to determine if military fire brigades would be in danger working near munitions depots. Other Swedish experts conducted and filmed tests showing that bullets heated to the point of explosion did not achieve sufficient velocity to penetrate their box container. In 1961, the then British ambassador to Ethiopia, Denis Wright, established in his annual report a linkage of Hammarskj√∂ld's death to British refusal to allow an Ethiopian military plane carrying troops destined to join the UN mission, landing at Entebbe and over-flying British-controlled Uganda to the Congo. Their refusal was lifted only after the death of the secretary-general. A foreign office official noting his comments on file, wrote affirming no \\"skeletons\\" in British cupboard and suggesting the ambassador's comments should be removed from the final, official \\"printed\\" version of the annual report.P R O FCO 31/165300 Ethiopia: Annual Review of 1961 On 19 August 1998, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), stated that recently uncovered letters had implicated the British MI5, the American CIA, and then South African intelligence services in the crash.\\"Notes for Media Briefing By Archbishop\\" ‚Äì by Desmond Tutu, Chairperson of the Truth And Reconciliation Commission ‚Äì 19 August 1998 ‚Äì One TRC letter said that a bomb in the aircraft's wheel bay was set to detonate when the wheels came down for a landing. Tutu said that they were unable to investigate the truth of the letters or the allegations that South African or Western intelligence agencies played a role in the crash. The British Foreign Office suggested that they may have been created as Soviet misinformation or disinformation.\\"UN assassination plot denied,\\" BBC World, 19 August 1998. Retrieved 13 October 2007. On 29 July 2005, Norwegian Major General Bj√∏rn Egge gave an interview to the newspaper Aftenposten on the events surrounding Hammarskj√∂ld's death. According to General Egge, who had been the first UN officer to see the body, Hammarskj√∂ld had a hole in his forehead, and this hole was subsequently airbrushed from photos taken of the body. It appeared to Egge that Hammarskj√∂ld had been thrown from the plane, and grass and leaves in his hands might indicate that he survived the crash ‚Äì and that he had tried to scramble away from the wreckage. Egge does not claim directly that the wound was a gunshot wound. In his speech to the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 23 September 2009, Colonel Gaddafi called upon the Libyan president of UNGA, Ali Treki, to institute a UN investigation into the deaths of Congolese prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, who was overthrown in 1960 and murdered the following year, and of Hammarskj√∂ld in 1961. According to a dozen witnesses interviewed by Swedish aid worker G√∂ran Bj√∂rkdahl in the 2000s, Hammarskj√∂ld's plane was shot down by another aircraft. Bj√∂rkdahl also reviewed previously unavailable archive documents and internal UN communications. He believes that there was an intentional shoot down for the benefit of mining companies like Union Mini√®re.I have no doubt Dag Hammarskj√∂ld's plane was brought down, G√∂ran Bj√∂rkdahl, The Guardian, 2011 Aug 17 A US intelligence officer who was stationed at an electronic surveillance station in Cyprus stated that he heard a cockpit recording from Ndola. In the cockpit recording a pilot talks of closing in on the DC-6 in which Hammarskj√∂ld was traveling, guns are heard firing, and then the words \\"I've hit it\\".BBC News Magazine, 18 September 2‚Äì11, \\"Dag Hammarskjold: Was His Death a Crash or a Conspiracy?\\" In 2011, the study by Susan Williams Who Killed Hammarskjold?,Susan Williams: Who Killed Hammarskj√∂ld?: The UN, the Cold War, and White Supremacy in Africa. London: Hurst. First edition 2011, 2nd edition with an additional chapter co-authored with Henning Melber and David Wardrop, December 2016. a University of London scholar of African decolonisation outlined several serious doubts about the accidental character of the plane crash in 1961. It led to the formation of independent, unofficial commission of inquiry in 2012 to provide an opinion on whether there was new evidence that would justify the UN re-opening its 1962 inquiry - the commission was headed by the British jurist Stephen Sedley. The Sedley commission's report was presented on 9 September 2013, at the Peace Palace in The Hague. It recommended that the UN re-open its inquiry \\"pursuant to General Assembly resolution 1759 (XVII) of 26 October 1962\\". Its findings formed the basis of the constitution of a panel of experts, and in March 2015 the appointment of Eminent Person Mohamed Chande Othman at the UN to support the ongoing Hammarskj√∂ld Commission. In April 2014, The Guardian published evidence implicating Jan van Risseghem, a military pilot who served with the RAF during World War II, later with the Belgian Air Force, and who became known as the pilot of Moise Tshombe in Katanga. The article claims that an American NSA employee, former naval pilot Commander Charles Southall, working at the NSA listening station in Cyprus in 1961 shortly after midnight on the night of the crash, heard an intercept of a pilot's commentary in the air over Ndola ‚Äì 3,000 miles away. Southall recalled the pilot saying: \\"I see a transport plane coming low. All the lights are on. I'm going down to make a run on it. Yes, it is the Transair DC-6. It's the plane,\\" adding that his voice was \\"cool and professional\\". Then he heard the sound of gunfire and the pilot exclaiming: \\"I've hit it. There are flames! It's going down. It's crashing!\\" Based on aircraft registration and availability with the Katangese Air Force, registration KAT-93, a Fouga CM.170 Magister would be the most likely aircraft used and the website Belgian Wings claims that van Risseghem piloted the Magisters for the KAF in 1961. A further article was published by The Guardian in January 2019, repeating the allegations against van Risseghem and citing further evidence uncovered by the makers of the documentary Cold Case Hammarskj√∂ld, including refutations of his alibi that he was not flying at the time of the crash. In December 2018, the German freelance historian Torben G√ºlstorff published an article in the Lobster magazine, arguing that a German Dornier DO-28A may have been used for the attack on Hammarskj√∂ld's DC-6. The plane was delivered to Katanga by end of August 1961 and would have been technically capable to accomplish such an assault.  Memorial  Hammarskj√∂ld's grave in Uppsala The Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Crash Site Memorial is under consideration for inclusion as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A press release issued by the Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo stated that, \\"... in order to pay a tribute to this great man, now vanished from the scene, and to his colleagues, all of whom have fallen victim to the shameless intrigues of the great financial Powers of the West... the Government has decided to proclaim Tuesday, 19 September 1961, a day of national mourning.\\" In media * The accident and subsequent investigation were featured in the 15th-series 5th episode of the documentary series Mayday (also known as Air Crash Investigation) titled \\"Deadly Mission\\", first broadcast in February 2016. * In the 2016 film The Siege of Jadotville, Hammarskj√∂ld's plane is intercepted by an F-4 Phantom II aircraft and it is implied that Katangese Prime Minister Moise Tshombe ordered it done, however the film ultimately leaves it ambiguous as Hammarskj√∂ld‚Äôs plane is never shown actually being shot down, only implied. The film is incorrect, however, in depicting the plane crash as taking place during the six day attack by Katangese forces against Irish Army peacekeepers led by Commandant Pat Quinlan. In reality, Hammarskj√∂ld died the day after the besieged Irish contingent had surrendered. * The 2019 film Cold Case Hammarskj√∂ld details and dramatizes the investigation into Hammarskj√∂ld's alleged assassination by Danish film director Mads Br√ºgger and Swedish private investigator G√∂ran Bj√∂rkdahl. The film concludes that Hammarskj√∂ld's plane was shot down by a Belgian mercenary, probably acting as part of a plot with CIA and MI-6 and coordinated by a mysterious South African paramilitary organization.

Fohlman's crusade against crime was motivated by his own experience of being brutally attacked. Early life and career Fohlman was born in 1979 in Uppsala County, Sweden. He started his first business, an advertising agency, at 19 years old and when he was 25 his business grossed over a million dollars. By this time he had also started an internet technology business and the tourist magazine for the city where he lived. It was simultaneously the year he was brutally attacked one night. Attack Fohlman was returning from dinner at a restaurant with his girlfriend and some friends when some men they did not know started bothering his girlfriend. Fohlman asked the men to desist from bothering her, and one of them punched him in the nose three times. Fohlman went to the hospital where he was told to come back after the weekend. Then he went to the police and were told that it would take several weeks to process his complaint. He received no information about his right to legal counseling or victim services. \\"The news left me wondering just how meaningful a police report was,\\" Fohlman said. When he was finally admitted to the hospital, it turned out that he had a broken nose, broken zygomatic bone, broken fundus, and broken cheek bones which required surgery. A titanium plate had to be placed in his face to hold the zygomatic bone in place. Fohlman was left with a permanent disability in the form of face numbness and nose distortion that makes breathing difficult. The restaurant at which Fohlman had eaten the night of his attack posted photos of that evening's guests and Fohlman was able to identify one of them as his attacker. Fohlman also identified the attacker as a former Big Brother reality television show contestant. He thought the judicial process would be quick and easy because of the number of witnesses and positive photo identification of the criminal, but his attacker did not show up for questioning. Fohlman's case languished in the Court of Appeals for four years. After a trial in which Fohlman believes his rights as victim were not respected, the attacker was acquitted. \\"It really feels like a worse violation than the actual beating,\\" Fohlman said. Safer Uppsala County Working with Magnus Lindgren, director of the Victims Unit of the Police in Uppsala county, Fohlman spearheaded Safer Uppsala County to protect crime victims from the kind of abuse and neglect that he experienced. Safer Uppsala County is sponsored by several businesses including L√§nsf√∂rs√§kringar, Swedbank, and McDonald's. The organization was first steered by a committee chaired by then Governor Anders Bj√∂rk. It is now chaired by the current governor. The organization is under the supervision of the police, but it maintains an independent budget. Foundation for Safer Sweden The Foundation for Safer Sweden grew out of Safer Uppsala County. Police departments around the country expressed interest in developing programs similar to that of Safer Uppsala County, but they did not follow through. After a while Fohlman decided to do it on a national scale himself. He went on to create the foundation known as Safer Sweden (Tryggare Sverige). Foundation for Safer Sweden was founded on the belief that better forms of collaboration are needed to assist crime victims and deter crime. Safer Sweden performs research and training on crime prevention and security. Safer Sweden provides an ombudsman for victims of crime and has also developed safety guides. The organization is supported by the Swedish Trade Federation, Swedish Housing, and Student Association and many others. It has to date helped over 100,000 people in Sweden.

In addition to working on the experimental validation of this hypothesis, Engel pursues research on its cognitive and theoretical implications. As a postdoctoral researcher with Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute, Engel was involved in studies that demonstrated the relevance of neural synchrony, in particular of so-called gamma waves, for processing of perceptual information. In particular, the group provided evidence that temporal correlations can serve for the binding of features into coherent sensory representations.Reviewed e.g. by In addition to addressing the relevance of synchrony and neuronal oscillations in the visual system, the work of Engel's group yielded evidence for a relation between neural synchrony and visual awareness. In addition, Engel and coworkers contributed to demonstrating a functional role of neural synchrony for sensorimotor coupling. In the past 15 years, Engel's group has expanded their work to the human brain, using EEG and MEG in combination with source modeling techniques.See e.g. The results of these studies demonstrate the importance of neuronal oscillations and synchrony for perceptual processing,See attention, working memory, decision-making and consciousness.See See Recent work of the group on the interaction of visual, auditory and tactile systems suggests a role of temporal binding for multisensory integration.Discussed in The group has developed novel methods for the electrophysiological analysis of resting state network activity. Engel's group also applies these approaches for the study of network malfunction in patients with movement disorders, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, in studies on pain, and altered networks after early sensory deprivation.Discussed in Engel also explores implications of these neurophysiogical results for theories of perception, cognition and action.Reviewed e.g. A major focus of his work are the implications of the studies on neural synchrony for understanding the neural correlates of consciousness.

Nick Borgen recorded the song with the players, and released it as a promo single. The song has later become popular as played when the home team scores. The words Den glider in originate from a famous report by Swedish radio reporter Lennart Hyland when Nils Nilsson scored the final goal in open goal when Sweden won, 5-3, against Canada before winning the entire tournament during the 1962 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship in Colorado, US. The song also became a Svensktoppen hit, charting between 29 April-6 May 1995, with a first position followed up with a third position.Svensktoppen - 1995 Sweden reached the final during the 1995 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship, losing to Finland. which was the first time ever Finland won the tournament and in Finland, a new version of the song was recorded when celebrating the victory.

The TSA would be required to adhere to existing federal law about what positions are classified as criminal investigators, a fact that determines pay and benefits. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Government employees who are classified as law enforcement personnel qualify for Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP) as well as extra retirement benefits. Employees receiving LEAP pay are compensated \\"at 25 percent above their base pay for two extra hours per day\\" and are \\"also eligible to retire sooner and receive more generous annuities from their pensions.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2014 would, in section four, direct the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) analyze the data and methods that the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security) uses to identify Transportation Security Administration (TSA) law enforcement officer and criminal investigators; and (2) provide relevant findings to the Assistant Secretary, including regarding whether the data and methods are adequate and valid. The bill would prohibit the TSA from hiring any new employee to work in its Office of Inspection if the Inspector General finds that such data and methods are inadequate or invalid, until: (1) the Assistant Secretary makes a certification to the House Committee on Homeland Security and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that only TSA employees who meet such requirements are classified as criminal investigators and are receiving premium pay and other benefits associated with such classification; and (2) the Inspector General submits a finding that the Assistant Secretary utilized adequate and valid data and methods to make such certification. Section five would direct the Assistant Secretary to: (1) reclassify criminal investigator positions in the Office of Inspection as noncriminal investigator positions or non-law enforcement positions if the individuals in those positions do not, or are not expected to, spend an average of at least 50% of their time performing criminal investigative duties; and (2) estimate the total long-term cost savings to the federal government resulting from such reclassification and provide such estimate to such committees. Requires such estimate to identify savings associated with the positions reclassified, including savings from: law enforcement training, early retirement benefits, law enforcement availability pay, weapons, vehicles, and communications devices. Section six would direct the Assistant Secretary to submit to such committees: (1) any materials in the possession or control of DHS associated with the Office of Inspection's review of the use of a federal firearms license by Federal Air Marshal Service officials to obtain discounted or free firearms for personal use; and (2) information on specific actions that will be taken to prevent Service officials from using a federal firearms license, or exploiting the Service's relationships with private vendors, to obtain discounted or free firearms for personal use. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 11, 2014. This is a public domain source. The Office of Inspection in the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of TSA‚Äôs operations and identifying vulnerabilities in the agency‚Äôs security systems. In carrying out its mission, the office conducts internal inspections, investigations, and covert tests to assess the integrity of the agency‚Äôs activities and its staff. Under current law, roughly half of the office‚Äôs employees are classified as criminal investigators and are eligible for certain statutory employment benefits because they are considered law enforcement officers. In particular, such individuals qualify for additional compensation (known as Law Enforcement Availability Pay) and enhanced retirement benefits. H.R. 4803 would direct the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review the data and methods that the TSA uses to classify personnel as law enforcement officers and to reclassify, as necessary, any staff of the Office of Inspection that are currently misclassified according to the results of that review. The bill would require DHS to provide various security-related updates and reports to the Congress. Based on information from DHS, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4803 would have no significant effect on federal spending. According to DHS, TSA is already undertaking an analysis of the agency‚Äôs workforce that will serve as the basis for potential reclassifications of personnel who do not meet criteria to be considered law enforcement officers, and CBO does not expect that enacting H.R. 4803 would significantly affect the timing or outcome of that process. We estimate that complying with the bill‚Äôs reporting requirements would cost less than $500,000, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. H.R. 4803 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4803 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 5, 2014 by Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security and the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security. The bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-513 on July 3, 2014. On July 22, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) supported the bill, saying \\"the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General has also found that TSA‚Äôs misclassification of some employees is wasting taxpayers' dollars and the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act ensures employee workload matches position and pay within the Office of Inspection.\\" Bill sponsor Rep. Sanford said that \\"even though there are federal standards in place that lay out how employees qualify for higher wages, the Transportation Security Administration pays some of their employees more for jobs they're not doing. That wouldn't make sense anywhere outside of government and our bill would help fix that problem by clarifying those employees' responsibilities.\\" According to Sanford, accurately reclassifying employees who do not spent at least 50 percent of the time on law enforcement activities and putting them on an accurate pay scale would save the government $17 million a year.

Flight simulation involves a device that artificially re-creates aircraft flight and the environment in which it flies for pilot training, design, or other purposes. It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density, turbulence, wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc. Manned simulation is used for a variety of reasons, including flight training (mainly of pilots), the design and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities. Unlike manned simulation, unmanned aircraft system (UAS) simulation does not involve a pilot aboard the training device.  Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Simulation Training  Manned flight simulators employ various types of hardware and software, depending on the modeling detail and realism that is required for the role in which they are to be employed. Designs range from PC laptop-based models of aircraft systems (called Part Task Trainers or PTTs), to replica cockpits for initial familiarization, to highly realistic simulations of the cockpit, flight controls and aircraft systems for more complete pilot training. The use of unmanned systems by defense forces globally has grown substantially over the past decade, and is only expected to continue to grow significantly. In addition, unmanned systems will be used increasingly for commercial applications such as remote inspection of pipelines and hydroelectric installations, surveillance of forest fires, observation of critical natural resources, assessing natural disasters and a range of other applications. This increase in the use of UAS capabilities results in the need to have more highly skilled UAS pilots, sensor operators, and mission commanders. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone and referred to as a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. Its flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle. The typical launch and recovery method of an unmanned aircraft is by the function of an automatic system or an external operator on the ground. Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted aircraft, but autonomous control is increasingly being employed. A UAS is composed of the UAV, itself, as well as associated launch, recovery, and control hardware and software. UAVs are usually deployed for military and special operation applications, but are also used in a small but growing number of civil applications, such as policing and firefighting, and nonmilitary security work such as surveillance of pipelines. UAVs are often preferred for missions that are too \\"dull, dirty or dangerous\\" for manned aircraft. UAS Simulation Training allows UAV operators to train in real-time to operate UAVs in a virtual environment that is realistic and accurate, but without the risks and constraints of a real flight. UAS simulation includes: * Simulated UAVS: The system allows training on both helicopter and fixed wing UAVs. * Training with the actual ground station: The system uses real data generated by the actual UAV autopilot to provide an extremely realistic simulation. * The virtual world in which the UAV flies is modeled in 3D with photo textures, and contains all the necessary features to simulate a mission in operational conditions. * Payload simulation: The system generates real- time video to simulate the payload output in both visible and IR modes. This video is piped to the actual video station as in the real system. * Simulation features: Multilingual interface, VCR type controls (replay forward / backward), Simulated weather functions, display options (flight panel, UAV trajectory), display of telemetry data. UAS Simulation Training combines an open architecture with commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and simulation software that helps the use of proprietary designs to provide a comprehensive, platform-agnostic training system. Customers benefit from greater flexibility for evolution, networking, distributed mission training and combination within an integrated training environment. UAS is a solution that optimizes operational readiness while minimizing the use of live assets to train and prepare the integrated mission team for operations. The comprehensive solution also prepares the integrated mission team (pilot, payload specialist, and commanding officer) in platform operating procedures, data interpretation and analysis, and team interaction.  UAS Training in the United States Armed Forces  Potential Air Force UAS pilots and sensor operators attend three and a half months of specialized training courses, most of which is simulated. In simulated training for the Predator, operators use a manual control stick, rudder system and monitor system that is the same as the live simulator. The Air Force's primary UAS training bases are at Holloman Air Force Base, NM, Cannon AFB, NM, Ellsworth AFB, SD, and Whiteman AFB, MO, but will take initial flight training in Pueblo, CO. Army soldiers receive training on smaller, easier to maneuver UAS, such as the Raven and Puma, from master trainers. Master trainers are selected from bases around the world and are given instruction at Ft. Benning, GA. These master trainers then train units at their home base. Army operators for larger UAS, such as the Shadow and Gray Eagle, conduct training in Fort Huachuca, AZ because of its remote location. These operators are UAS fight specialist for a single specific model. This is due to the different capabilities and functions of each air craft. Training is a combination of live and simulated training to teach new operators. Training is easily simulated because it is almost the same experience as live training in the aircraft that is operated by a Ground Control Station (GCS). The standard for the Navy was to use pilots who have completed at least one piloting tour before allowing training in operating a UAS. With the advancement and economy of simulators, the Navy is beginning to train enlisted personnel with flight experience to become operators. Capt. Patrick Smith, a Fire Scout program manager was quoted to state, ‚ÄúIdeally, we take [potential operators] from the SH-60 SeaHawk community and add them to the five-week program, mainly simulator-based.\\" The Navy conducts UAS training in Ft. Huachuca, AZ for live simulation or military installations near Patuxent River, MD for the Fire Scouts. In 2014, Marines that complete the Basic School Officer course in Quantico, VA, will have taken training in small UAS (Raven and Puma). UAS are not widely used in the Marines, but as the UAS become smaller and more mobile, they will become more integrated in mission resources. Marines recently started to receive training from the Group I (under 20 pounds) UAS Training and Logistics Support Activity in Camp Lejeune, NC. UAS in inventory for each branch of service: * Air Force: MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and RQ-4 Global Hawk. * Army: RQ-11 Raven, RQ-7 Shadow, RQ-5 Hunter, MQ-1C Gray Eagle and RQ-20 Puma. * Navy: BAMS, Firescout/VTUAV, STUAS, Scan Eagle, and UCASS UAS. The UCASS was scheduled to be replaced by the UCLASS in fiscal year 2015. * Marine Corps: RQ-7 Shadow and STUAS.  UAS Training in Domestic/Civil Sectors  Firefighters, police, miners, and weather researchers are now using UAVs (commonly referred to as drones), which were first used in military sectors. The drones used by police and firefighters are the same type of drones; however, they are used for different purposes. UAVs have gone beyond the human capacity of lifting heavy loads, performing daring photography amidst a heavy storm, and digitizing images that can be converted into 3D maps. Weather researchers use different drones to help predict weather, photograph storms and measure temperature. Drones are very essential for weather crews in predicting wind speed and temperature, wind direction, air temperature and pressure (Aerosonde Mark 4). Other drones are used for taking images of storm systems, even inside the storm itself. Like the Mark 4, NASA's Global Hawk is used to measure air temperature, wind speed, and pressure, but unlike the Mark 4, it can take images of the storm system. In mining, drones help miners with tasks such as inspection and maintenance, carrying heavy equipment, and even carrying out tasks 24 hours a day/7 days a week. The mining industry uses drones such as Responder and Serenity to assist mining crews with maintenance, inspection, and imagery. Some drones within the mining industry assist workers with photography of the sediments to be mined so it can be calculated in terms of volume for removal and the stockpile of sediment graded by workers. In police forces, drones are used for bomb detonation, response to incidents, pursuing criminals in the air, and determining a suspect's location using high tech camera systems (Viking 400-S). Other uses for drones in police sectors are to record incidents, create maps of the incidents in 3D models, and then later send them to officers‚Äô smart phones (Sensefly eBee). Other drones, such as the Kaman drop supplies and equipment for officers, as well as transport officers to and back from the crime scene. The E300 is used to stop criminals and record an incident. Firefighters use the same drones, but for different purposes. For example, ELIMCO's E300 is used to put out fires, the Viking 400-S uses a camera to photograph incidents, then later transmits the images back to firefighting personnel for mapping the incidents electronically. The Information Processing Systems‚Äô MCV, like the E300 is used for putting out wildfires and man-made fires. The eBee, like its police variant takes photographs with a 16 MP camera, which is used to create 3D models of maps through integrating technology from Google Maps. It is later sent to firefighting personnel smart phones. The Kaman, like its police variant, is used to supply firefighters and victims of fires, and to provide medical assistance. The Defikopter sends defibrillators to victims of heart attack. To locate a victim, it uses a GPS system.  UAS Training in Higher Education  There are two primary roles or purposes for UAS in higher education: * Training and certification of UAS operators * UAS-related research = Specific UAS Applications by School = At the University of North Dakota (UND) Bachelor of Science in Aeronautics program, simulators are used for both operator certification and research purposes. For operator certification, UND uses Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) simulators specific to a particular vehicle (e.g., ScanEagle, MQ-8, etc.). Actual qualification training is on hold until the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) puts standards in place for the use of UAS in United States airspace. However, students can learn basic operation principles and how UAS will function in national airspace. UND also conducts research funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory on task loading of UAS operators. This research compares single operators versus multi-operator crews and full auto-piloted systems versus remotely piloted systems. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL uses simulators in an undergraduate UAS operator program awarding a Bachelor of Science degree in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Science. Primarily, this program trains UAS operators, but it also serves a research role to test the application of UAS in national airspace. Several other schools offer non- engineering based UAS undergraduate programs, of which simulators are an integral part. Some examples include: * Indiana State University: Minor in Unmanned Systems * Kansas State University ‚Äì Salina: Bachelor of Science in Unmanned Aircraft Systems * Oklahoma State University: UAS option for MS or PhD degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering  Agent based Modeling and Simulation of UAS  UAV Simulators generally focus on low-level flight control and coordination by using complex physics-based models that are geared towards accuracy. These simulators requires domain expertise and complex knowledge to build, learn and operate the simulator itself. Alternate simulators are being developed such as Agent Based Modeling and Simulation for UAS, especially by military. Agent based modeling and simulation of UAV focuses on specialized issues such as coordination and planning. For example, the CoUAV. simulator focuses on cooperative search and MAS-Planes focuses on request servicing by decentralized coordination. Agent based simulation has also been used for UAV flight dynamic simulation modeling. Agent based modeling and simulation has been used for managing missions for UAS. The authors used Codarra Avatar for their experiments. Codarra Avatar is a lightweight UAV which has been specifically built for small-scale reconnaissance and surveillance missions. This UAV can be assembled and disassembled very quickly and transported in a backpack. However, in becoming an autonomous UAV, the Codarra Avatar faces challenges of flight time, flight range, durability, limited computational power, limited sensory data, and flight regulations and restrictions. The authors developed Agent-Flight Control System Architecture (FCS) to combat the issues faced with the UAV. FCS has an agent that sits at the top of a control tree, receives data at regular intervals, and issues high level waypoint commands. The agent is designed in JACK, an agent-oriented programming language. The behavior of agents defined using JACK are structured around the BDI (Belief, Desire, Intentions) theory of agency. The mission Management System is designed using the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) Approach that was developed by Colonel John Boyd. Authors conducted successful tests in Melbourne, Australia, using an FCS Architecture on the Codarra Avatar UAV.

It is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and governed by a board of trustees. It offers its study abroad program through the Athens-based International Center for Hellenic and Mediterranean Studies (DIKEMES). CYA is the first study abroad program in Greece for English speaking students and is a member of NAFSA: Association of International Educators, EAIE: European Association for International Education, and a charter member of FORUM: Forum on Education Abroad.  History  CYA was founded in 1962 by Ismene Phylactopoulou (1907-1983), a graduate of Wellesley College who received the Doctorate of Humane Letters from DePauw University in recognition of her achievements in study abroad. Campus The program's academic facilities are located at 5 Plateia Panathinaikou Stadiou, next to the Athens Marble Stadium (panathenaic Stadium), in the Pangrati area of Athens, near the Athens National Gardens and Lycabettus Hill. Curriculum The CYA study abroad program focuses upon the history and civilization of Greece and the Mediterranean region. The program of studies originally focused on Archaic and Classical Greece; over time, the historical range was expanded to include courses from prehistoric to modern times. In 1986 courses were added on the history, politics, and international affairs of the Balkans, western Asia, and the Middle East in recent times. Later in 1993, courses in European and East Mediterranean Studies were added. All classes are taught in English, while Modern Greek language courses are offered as part of the curriculum. Many courses are taught on-site at archaeological sites and museums. Study-travel is an integral part of the CYA curriculum and trips are conducted by faculty and staff. Students visit major sites relevant to ancient, Byzantine, or modern Greek history during trips to Crete, the Peloponnese, and Central and Northern Greece. The program is organized using American standards for teaching and grading. CYA offers its own year- or semester-long program, as well as shorter summer programs. It also creates and hosts customized programs for other US educational institutions. Library resources The CYA Library has a collection of approximately 5.500 books, CDs and DVDs in the fields of philosophy, history, art and archaeology, ethnography, literature, languages, religion and politics, natural sciences, and maintains various subscriptions to print journals and newspapers, a subscription to the Blegen Library of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, as well as part of JSTOR's database of electronic journals and to Columbia International Affairs Online. It is the first library in Greece to use the open source Integrated Library System KOHA for cataloguing, catalog searches, circulation, and patron management, and also makes use of the Course Management System Moodle, which facilitates instructor communication with students regarding course assignments, on-site meeting times and places, and important updates. Housing CYA students live in self-contained apartments in residential apartment buildings in the Pangrati area of Athens, which are situated a two- to ten-minute walk from the Academic Center. A typical apartment houses four or five students. Notable Faculty *Frederick Ahl *Peter Green *H.D.F. Kitto *Kimon Friar *Philip Sherrard *Stewart Perowne Notable alumni *David L.

Description The (diameter) bulb is red-brown in colour with veining. The largest bulbs of the Iris subg. Xiphium subgenus are Iris tingitana. In the US, bulbs with an 11 cm circumference are recommended to be used by flower producers. It has flowers in various shades of blue.} It has pale blue veins on the flowers and has generally between 1 and 2 flowers to a stem. The stems is hidden by two channelled leaves.Richard Lynch It blooms between February and May. The plant can grow to a maximum height of 60 cm (24 in) and its leaves appear in the autumn. They can grow up to 1 1/2 ft high. =Biochemistry= 'Iriskumaonin' (C18H24O7 is found within the bulbs of Iris tingitana, as well as Iris germanica and Iris kemaonensis.John Buckingham, V. Ranjit N. Munasinghe Taxonomy The name is derived from 'tingitana' from the Greek word meaning 'from Tangiers'. It is pronounced 'ting-ee-TAN-uh' It is often mistakenly called 'Spanish Iris'. The Spanish Iris is Iris xiphium. It was first published and described by Pierre Edmond Boissier and George Fran√ßois Reuter in 'Pugillus Plantarum Novarum Africae Borealis Hispaniaeque Australis' (Pugill. Pl. Afr. Bor. Hispan.) Vol. 113 in January 1852. It was then illustrated in Curtis's Botanical Magazine, Tab. 6775 on 1 September 1884. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 14 April 2009. Iris tingitana is listed in the RHS Plant Finder. Distribution and habitat It is native to Africa. =Range= It is found in Morocco and Algeria. It is also found in North Africa, Spain and Portugal. Conservation In 2014, it was becoming rare in Morocco. Cultivation It is very susceptible to iris mosaic virus.Kenneth M. Smith It can be propagated by bulblets, 1 to 4 small bulbs growing beside the main bulb which can then be taken off and planted to grow on to form a new bulb. It has a reputation of being a difficult species to grow in the UK. Even in the US, it is restricted to be grown in mild climates such as southern California. Due to the limited hardiness of the species, it is better grown in a bulb frame or grown in a dry border then lifted and stored like dahlias. It can be grown in pots for inside or outside displays.

Gustavus graduated in 1806 from the University of Pennsylvania and returned to Howard County to practice medicine with his father. The elder Warfield died intestate in 1813, and Gustavus eventually took possession of part of his father's estate. In the 1820s, he built a manor house, part of which stands today. Warfield practiced medicine and ran his forced-labor farm in the house; he would keep patients in a loft above his office if they were unfit to travel. It feature numerous outbuildings and a smokehouse. The Warfields built a graveyard for people they enslaved; it sits to the south of the house. In 1860, Robert E.

In the 1960s, proponents attempted to consolidate county government on land purchased recently by The Rouse Company in its development of the city of Columbia, but did not go forward. In 1962 more additions were added to the original courthouse. In 1980 County Executive J. Hugh Nichols approved a renovation that included a 14,500 sq ft addition that connected to the Howard County Circuit Courthouse. The Howard County Circuit Courthouse is located at 8360 Court Avenue in Ellicott City, Maryland. The courthouse houses the chambers and courtrooms for the 5 judges of the Circuit Court for Howard County, as well as the clerk's offices, jurors' assembly room, the law library and masters' offices.

Life He was the son of Joseph Hardman, a London merchant from Manchester, who knew Samuel Taylor Coleridge and contributed to Blackwood's Magazine. On leaving Whitehead's school at Ramsgate, he entered the counting-house of his maternal uncle Rougemont, a London merchant. In 1834 Hardman joined the Auxiliary Legion as lieutenant in the second Lancers. Severely wounded in one of the last engagements of the First Carlist War, he passed his convalescence at Toulouse. On returning to England he became a regular contributor to Blackwood. A critical review of the Salon de Paris which Hardman sent to The Times led to his being taken on about 1850 as a foreign correspondent. He was first at Madrid, and was in Constantinople during the Russo-Turkish war of 1853. In the Crimean War that followed, he wrote about the drunkenness in the British Army after the suspension of hostilities. Hardman went on to the Danubian Principalities, advised Cavour at Turin, and witnessed the campaigns in the Second Italian War of Independence, Hispano-Moroccan War, and Second Schleswig War. He was at Tours and Bordeaux in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1, and was at Rome in 1871-3. Succeeding Laurence Oliphant as chief correspondent of The Times in Paris, Hardman died there on 6 November 1874. Works Hardman's first article (1840) was an account of an expedition with the guerilla chief Mart√≠n Zurbano. It was reprinted with other papers in Peninsular Scenes and Sketches. The Student of Salamanca, a novel, was also reprinted, and Tales from Blackwood contains nine of his shorter stories. In 1849 he edited Thomas Hamilton's Annals of the Peninsular Campaign, in 1852 he published Central America, and in 1854 he translated Charles Weiss's History of the French Protestant Refugees.

Life James Edward Le Rossignol was born on 24 October 1866 in Quebec City, the son of Peter Le Rossignol and Mary (Gillispie) Le Rossignol. His father was born on the Jersey Channel Islands He was educated at the Montreal High School and Huntington academy. He went on to McGill University in Montreal, Leipzig University in Germany and Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, earning a B.A.. Ph.D.. and LL.D. In 1898 he married Jessie Katherine Ross. Le Rossignol was a Professor of Economics at the University of Denver in 1907. He was appointed Professor of Economics at the University of Nebraska in 1911, and Director of the School of Commerce from 1913 to 1919. In 1919 he was appointed Dean of the College of Business Administration. He wrote works on economics as well as several books of short stories and the novel Jean Baptiste (1915). Le Rossignol died on 4 December 1959. Writings Le Rossignol's 1901 Monopolies Past and Present, said to \\"provide an historical introduction to the study of monopolies for the use of busy men\\", covered ancient monopolies, gilds, exclusive trading companies, patents, municipal monopolies, railways and capitalistic monopolies. A reviewer said that \\"it seems to be tolerably well adapted to the needs of the larger constituency for which it was designed.\\" The book was criticized for poor coverage of joint stock undertakings and development of the business corporation. It presented the standard arguments for industrial combinations. A review of Le Rossignol's 1907 Orthodox Socialism said, \\"One of our ablest writers on economics here defines broadly the creed of socialism, and points out its weaknesses. Strikes, labor unions, the struggle of mass with class, and the perpetual questions of wages and profit come in for their share of intelligent attention. The book is worth pondering over by every earnest voter\\". Talking of Karl Marx's theory of value, La Rossignol wrote, \\"Orthodox socialists are deeply concerned to prove it true, for if it can be shown that all values are created by labor alone, it must surely follow that all should belong to the hand and brain that created them.\\" Le Rossignol was at the University of Denver when he published his 1910 book on State Socialism in New Zealand, co- authored with William Downie Stewart Jr, a barrister in Dunedin, New Zealand. A reviewer said the authors had achieved their very laudable aim of showing the \\"workings of the various social experiments as they are without exaggeration of concealment.\\" The reviewer called the book \\"an illuminating study of the remarkable series of instructive experiments in socialistic legislation, for which New Zealand has become conspicuous, together with that Australian Commonwealth, which is its nearest neighbour.\\" Peter Haworth and his wife Bobs Cogill Haworth jointly illustrated Le Rossignol's The Habitant Merchant (1939), a collection of short stories.

The bill also would amend the requirements for the department‚Äôs net-price calculator, which provides details on the costs of post-secondary education. The purpose of the bill is to help students get the facts they need to make a wise decision about where to go to college. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to eliminate the restriction of college cost calculations to those costs incurred by first-time students. The bill would eliminate the requirement that the United States Secretary of Education make publicly available on the College Navigator website: (1) college affordability and transparency lists, and (2) state higher education spending charts. The bill would require that the Secretary develop, annually update, and make publicly available a College Dashboard website that displays the following information regarding each institution of higher education (IHE) participating in the programs under title IV (Student Assistance) of the HEA: :*a link to the IHE's website; :*an identification of the IHE's type; :*the number of students enrolled at the IHE; :*the student-faculty ratio; :*the percentage of degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduate students at the IHE who obtain a certificate within the normal time for completing their program, within 150% of that time period, and within 200% of that time period; :*the average net price per year for undergraduate students at the IHE and a link to the net price calculator for the IHE; :*the average student loan debt incurred by undergraduate students in the course of obtaining a certificate or degree from the IHE; :*the IHE's cohort default rate; and :*a link to national and regional data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on starting salaries in all major occupations. The bill would direct the Secretary to publish more detailed and disaggregated IHE information regarding student enrollment, completion rates, costs, and use of financial aid on Internet web pages that are linked to through the College Dashboard website. The bill would require the Secretary to: (1) include on the College Dashboard website a function enabling users to easily compare information between IHEs, and (2) provide each student who submits a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) with a link to the web page of the College Dashboard website that contains information for each IHE on the student's FAFSA. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on July 10, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4983 would reserve $1 million from funding for the United States Department of Education to replace the current College Navigator website with a new website and change the type of information that the website would need to provide. The bill also would amend the requirements for the department‚Äôs net-price calculator, which provides details on the costs of post-secondary education. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4983 would require $1 million for administrative costs for the department over the 2015-2019 period, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4983 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 26, 2014 by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R, NC-5). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce. It was reported (amended) on July 17, 2014 alongside House Report 113-530. The House voted on July 23, 2014 to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion The House Education Committee, which passed the bill, described that bill as one that \\"would improve consumer information to provide a more complete picture of all student populations, streamline existing transparency efforts at the federal level to reduce confusion for students, and require better coordination by federal agencies to avoid duplication and confusion.\\" According to the Committee, the legislation will address the problem of students struggling to choose a college but being unable to sort through all of the available data. According to Adjunct Action, the bill will \\"require universities to reveal important information about the working conditions of adjunct faculty, who are now the majority of faculty in higher education.\\" Service Employees International Union International President Mary Kay Henry supported the bill, saying that \\"it's good to see Congress is interested in shining a spotlight on trends in higher education that have marginalized contingent and part-time faculty.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Education in the United States References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4983 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4983 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4983 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4983 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4983 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4983 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:United States proposed federal education legislation ","title":"Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act"},{"id":"43375053","text":"John Stockdale Hardy (1793‚Äì1849) was an English legal practitioner known as an antiquary.
