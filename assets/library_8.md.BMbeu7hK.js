Connell's best-selling book of the same name. It starred Gary Cole (George Armstrong Custer) and featured Dean Stockwell (General Philip Sheridan), Rosanna Arquette (Elizabeth Custer), Rodney A. Grant (Crazy Horse), Nick Ramus (Red Cloud), Buffy Sainte-Marie (voice of Kate Bighead), and Floyd Red Crow Westerman (Sitting Bull). Plot The film, in two parts, begins in 1876 when the Terry-Gibbon column relieves the remnants of the 7th Cavalry that had survived the Battle of the Little Bighorn. They discover Custer's Squadron has been annihilated, and the film 'flashes back' and tells Custer's story from the point of view/narrative of his wife, Elizabeth, beginning with the Kansas campaign of the mid-1860s. Concurrently, the Indian perspective is told through the narrative of Kate Bighead, a young Cheyenne woman, who encountered Custer on several occasions. Kate Bighead's narrative is also used to describe events like the Fetterman Massacre and the Battle of Washita River, as is Elizabeth Custer's, to provide a balanced point of view.

Lincoln (uncredited) Production The release of the mini-series closely followed the theatrical release of Dances with Wolves. Although Kevin Costner was the first choice to play Custer, the role eventually went to Gary Cole. The movie was partially filmed on private property near the Little Bighorn National Monument in Montana near Billings, where a fort was built at a cost of $200,000. Filming also took place in South Dakota at Buffalo Gap and Badlands National Park. 400 horses and 150 Native Americans were employed for the shoot. The 7th Cavalry consisted of 100 historical re-enactors who also doubled as technical advisers for the film. Reception Variety praised the production as \\"a master work\\", with special mentions of quality in production, direction, cinematography and editing. New York magazine drew a comparison between the recently released Dances with Woives stating that the Son of the Morning Star version of Custer as \\"deals in delusions instead of dreams\\". The mini-series won four 1991 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Achievement In Costuming for a Miniseries or a Special, Outstanding Achievement In Makeup for a Miniseries or a Special, Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries or a Special, and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Miniseries or a Special. It was also nominated for, but did not win, Outstanding Achievement in Hairstyling for a Miniseries or a Special.

It is owned by Sonning Parish Council and managed by the Friends of Ali’s Pond. The pond adjoins King George's Field in Sonning. It was established in 1997 by professional ecologist and local resident Alastair Driver (hence the site's name), who acts as the voluntary warden. The area is laid out with paths and large ponds. Following the discovery of breeding Great Crested Newts during the Millennium Festival pond-dipping sessions in the summer of 2000, an application was made to English Nature for local nature reserve status for the site. The first site management plan was produced in September 2000 and the site was officially declared Ali’s Pond LNR in April 2001, making Sonning Parish Council only the third parish council in the country to declare an LNR. The nature area has been created and managed for the use and enjoyment of all sections of the local community, as well as for visitors to the village. Key England Biodiversity Strategy priority species which have colonized the site so far include Great-crested Newt, Stag Beetle, Song Thrush and Pipistrelle Bat. In total, 18 species of dragonfly, over 250 species of larger moth and over 40 species of aquatic/wetland plants have been recorded at the site since its establishment in 1997. The field immediately to the south and west of Ali’s Pond LNR was purchased by Reading Blue Coat School in 2006. Then, in 2007, as a condition of the planning application to change the land use designation of that field from agriculture to sport, another nature area was created within it to provide additional habitat for Great Crested Newts. This area is known as Sonning Field and contains another amphibian breeding pond, log and brushwood piles and new hedgerows with a wide variety of native trees and shrubs. A permissive path enables easy access through from Ali’s Pond and across Sonning Field through to Sonning Lane. In addition to the wholly informal use of the site, a Friends of Ali’s Pond (FAP) Group has been set up which now has over 60 members, most of whom live within a couple of miles of the site. Members of this group participate in volunteer management activities such as tree planting, pond clearance and hay-making and attend moth and amphibian surveys under the guidance of the voluntary warden Alastair Driver. These activities have not been confined solely to the reserve — conservation work has also been carried out in other nearby locations to provide complementary habitat and amenity to that found in the reserve. The Friends of Ali's Pond received the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management 2016 Best Practice Award for Practical Nature Conservation - Small Scale.

J. Lincoln version= The film was adapted from The Bush King, a play originally written by W. J. Lincoln The play was about Roger Dalmore, a young English officer who argues with his father, a Cornish mine owner, then emigrates to Australia, where he discovers he is charged with murdering and robbing his father. Although the real culprit is his cousin, Dalmore flees to the bush, where he is rescued by cattle-stealing bushrangers and, due in part of his military experience, becomes their leader under the name Captain Dart. Dart falls in love with a banker's daughter and another lady falls for him; the latter attempts to betray him to the police after she realises Dart does not love her, however the bushranger escapes. The cousin comes to Australia and becomes involved in defrauding investors in a worthless mine. The cousin plans to blow up the mine but is foiled by Dart who gets him to eventually confesses his crime. He is united with the captain's daughter. The play debuted in London and over five months it played at three London theatres. \\"The whole thing is a libel on Australian life as it is\\", complained one critic. When Lincoln returned to Australia the play then ran in Melbourne for a week in 1894. Lincoln did some further revisions and the play had a brief run at the Novelty Theatre in London in 1897.W. J. Lincoln at Australian Variety Theatre Archive. Accessed 8 September 2013 =Alfred Dampier version= The play was rewritten by Alfred Dampier (Rolfe's father in law), writing as \\"Adam Pierre\\". He set the play entirely in Australia, changed the hero from being the son of a Cornish mine owner to the son of a wealthy Australian station owner, added a fifth act, renamed the hero Captain Midnight instead of Captain Dart, and added a role for himself as an old bushman, Ned Harling (In the original Harling was a publican but only in a small part).Fotheringham p54 The play ends with Edgar marrying Thelma, leaving Elsa alone. The play premiered in Sydney on 26 January 1901. It was very popular and was frequently performed throughout the 1900s. Production Lottie Lyell and Raymond Longford appeared in the movie as second leads.\\"Raymond Longford\\", Cinema Papers, January 1974 p51 According to contemporary reports, the actors researched their roles for seven months – this may be a reference to the amount of time they had played the parts on stage. Charles Cozens Spencer hired Englishman Alan J. Williamson to oversee production. Williamson later said that the script only came to half a dozen pages and was carefully written to not have any interior scenes as there were no studio facilities at the time. Shooting took place in the Sydney suburbs of Narrabeen and Frenchs Forest, as well as in the Blue Mountains, with an average of five or six scenes being filmed a day. Williamson claimed occasionally reshoots were needed but the actors were unavailable because of theatrical commitments, so they would just write a title to cover it. The budget was originally ₤300 but went up to ₤800. Alan Williamson during filming Williamson said that Raymond Longford also worked as his assistant and was a \\"tower of strength\\" throughout the shoot.From his unpublished memoirs, in Graham Shirley * Andree Wright, \\"Kelly: Hit or Myth\\", Cinema Papers, July 1987 p16-18 The scene of Captain Midnight leaping off a cliff on horseback into a river and swimming away admit a hail of bullets was well received and \\"soon became obligatory for bushrangers in Australian cinema folklore.\\" It has been suggested this scene was inspired by a similar moment in Alfred Dampier's 1891 Wild West drama The Scout.Fotheringham p 58 Some lines of verse by Joseph L Goodman appeared on screen. Release Still from film It was a critical and popular success – Williamson claimed the film recouped its budget from one cinema alone. One critic wrote that: > There is hardly a moment but is associated with some exciting incident, and > the audience last night followed the picture with repeated bursts of > cheering and applause, which found echo in the unrestrained appreciation > manifest at its termination. Sensational horsemanship and thrilling > adventure have been woven into a plot plausible in its entirety and of > absorb ing interest.

Miss Lily Dampier and Mr Alfred Rolfe figured to much > advantage... a long series of beautiful bush spaces... gave realism and > distinction to the story. Charles Cozens Spencer would later make three other films based on Alfred Dampier play adaptations of novels set in colonial Australia, Captain Starlight, or Gentleman of the Road (1911), The Life of Rufus Dawes (1911) and The Romantic Story of Margaret Catchpole (1912). The first two were directed by Alfred Rolfe, but the third was made by Raymond Longford, whose early career was sponsored by Spencer. =UK & USA= The movie was released in England via Jury's Pictures, where it received enthusiastic reviews.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p 14 The film was one of a number of Spencer movies bought for release in the US by Sawyer Inc in 1913. It was retitled The Bushranger's Bride.http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/motionp09moti_0377 Remake A copy of a script adapted from the play by Rolfe is available at the National Archives of Australia dated 1920. This script does not have the main character turn bushranger. It is likely it is a script for a proposed remake, considering the ban on bushranger films that had been in force in New South Wales since 1912.

One critic wrote that \\"plenty of relief in the way of comedy has been introduced; and whilst there are many grim incidents, these are not allowed to unduly obtrude themselves.\\" The film starts at the home of the Marston family. Some troopers, led by Sergeant Goring, are looking for Captain Starlight. Goring harasses Aileen Marston when a Mr Beresford appears. Beresford introduces himself as Captain Starlight and tells them to put their hands up. According to a contemporary report, \\"Sergeant Goring, with both hands in the air, carries the situation off with as much dignity as can be expected, but some of his men fall to the ground in terror.\\" Starlight and his friends go to the horse races at Turon where Starlight enters his horse Rainbow in the Goldfield Cup under the name Darkie. Starlight encourages all his friends to bet on the horse, but his jockey is found to be too drunk to ride and Starlight has to run the race himself. He wins but is chased off the course by police. Starlight and his gang, including the vicious Dan Moran, hold up the mail coach at Rocky Rises. Moran robs a pretty young girl but Starlight points his revolver at him and persuades him to hand the young lady back her money. When Starlight discovers that the young lady has no other money apart from that on her possession, he takes her purse and puts a wad of bank notes in it, then restores it to her. Later Sir Ferdinand Morringer is captured by Moran. He is tied to a tree at Terrible Hollow in order to make him confess where the money to pay the troopers has been concealed. Morringer will not tell so Moran starts beating him. The bushranger is about to kill Morringer when Starlight intervenes, overpowers Moran and sets Morringer free. Moran is captured by the police. He leads Sergeant Goring and the troopers to Starlight's stronghold. During the final battle, Moran is mortally wounded but Starlight's life is saved by Warrigul, his faithful aboriginal servant who carries him across a river to safety. Starlight and Dick Marston are subsequently pardoned for their crimes, due in part to the influence of Morringer. This happy ending was in contrast to the novel but consistent with the play adaptation.'THE LYCEUM', The Sydney Morning Herald Monday 20 March 1911 p 4'Amusements', The Advertiser (Adelaide), Friday 9 June 1911 p8 Contemporary advertisements listed a synopsis of scenes and events.

Original stage adaptation In collaboration with journalist Garnet Walch, Dampier adapted the novel into a play in 1890. The play made some key changes to the story, such as: *making Dick Marston and Captain Starlight both innocent of murder, enabling them to be both pardoned; *Starlight was no longer killed and Dick Marston did not serve 12 years in gaol;Fotheringham, p15 *Sub Inspector Goring, a relatively minor character in the novel was turned into more of a villain, harassing Aileen Marston; *the major villain was bushranger Dan Moran; *the climax involves Moran holding Sir Ferdinand captive in Terrible Hollow, rescued by Starlight; *it ends with Moran attempting to stab Dick Marston, killing Kate Morrison who saves Dick's life; *the addition of comic Irish policemen, O'Hara and Maginnis, plus a comic maid, Miss Euphrosyne Aspen (variations on these characters appeared in plays based on the Kelly Gang); *changing the character of Warrigan from a villainous type loyal to Starlight to a comic character.Adaptations of Robbery Under Arms accessed 26 November 2014 The play drew heavily on the story of Ned Kelly and his family – in particular Constable Fitzpatrick's harassment of Kate Kelly, which inspired Goring's treatment of Martson – as well as the themes of the novel Les Misérables.Fotheringham p 64-65 It is considered likely Garnet Walch's main contribution to the play was providing a comic subplot.Fotheringham p 67-68 The play was highly successful and was much revived during the 1890s and 1900s, including performances in London in 1894. Dampier played the role of Captain Starlight on stage many times to great acclaim, and it was the role he was most identified with during his career.Alfred Dampier at Live Performance Hall of FameReview of 1905 production Alfred Rolfe, who later directed the movie, was well versed with the play, having played Sir Ferdinand Morringer in its first production, George Storefield in a revival, and Dick Marston in later productions. In 1893 he married Dampier's daughter Lily, who played Aileen Marston in numerous productions of the play.Fotheringham p 45 The play was highly influential on bushranging drama as a genre, leading to a number of imitators such as Arnold Denham's The Kelly Gang (1899), which was likely the basis for the film The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906).Fortheringham p 52 Production It is likely the name of the story was changed from Robbery Under Arms to avoid confusion with the 1907 film version of the novel which was still playing in cinemas.Fortheringham p 58 Reception It appears the film was a success at the box office, screening in cinemas as late as 1917. The Moving Picture World called it \\"a brilliant success and record breaker, and highly eulogised by the press and public.\\"\\"Australian Letter\\", The Moving Picture World July to Sept 1911 p 134 =Critical response= It also received good reviews, the Sunday Times saying \\"the 'chase scene' through the bush and across a lagoon is very realistic.\\" The Register called it \\"a thrilling and absorbingly interesting story of Australian bush life, and several daring feats of horsemanship are displayed.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald stated that \\"one of the most applauded of the scenes... was the burning of the stables and the rescue of the horses, Starlight's Last Stand also excited enthusiasm.\\" The Argus said the film was: > A series of exciting incidents, situations, and escapades... sustained > interest throughout and tells the story in a straightforward businesslike > way, with a judicious mixture of comedy to relieve it from too great a > weight of sensationalism.

This was in line with Spencer's version of Robbery Under Arms which had a happier ending than the original novel. Cast *Alfred Rolfe as Rufus Dawes *Lily Dampier as Sylvia *Raymond Longford as Gabbett *Lottie Lyell *Stanley Walpole *Augustus Neville Original Play The film was based on a stage play adaptation of the novel which Dampier had performed in. =First Version of Play= Dampier originally did a version of the play in the 1880s where he played Reverend North. The play was adapted by Thomas Walker using the name \\"Thomas Somers\\". (Walker later became a speaker for the West Australian Parliament.) The structure of the play was as follows: *Prologue-England, 1827. The \\"Spaniards\\" Inn, Hampstead, Winter – with Rev North, Maurice Frere, Richard Devine, Lady Devine, Sarah Rex – ending in \\"The Murder in the Snow\\" Then the rest of the play set in Van Dieman's Land 1830-37: *Tableaux 1 ; Convict Settlement at Sarah Island – The Cannibal's Return – The Smuggled \\"Wood\\" and its Consequences – The Story of Two Birds of Prey- Revolt of the Convicts – I'll teach you to flog a man on gruel – The Broad Arrow. *Tableaux 2 : After the Revolt – The Island – The Surprise Hunger and Solitude have tamed me, Sir.

Scene 2: That Brutal Face – Sylvia Regains her Memory. REDEMPTION. It originally ran for only a week at the Alexandra Theatre in Melbourne, and had an unsuccessful revival there in 1890 and in Sydney in 1893.Fotheringham, p25, 32 Rival Versions Dampier's production of the novel was not the only one available to audiences at the time. In 1886 there was a production adapted by George Leitch In 1887 there was another production in Sydney based on an adaptation by \\"T. South\\". Walter Baker also did an adaptation. However Dampier's was allegedly the only production which paid a royalty to Clarke's widow. =Second Version of Play= Dampier later worked on another version with Thomas Walker which had a more successful run in Sydney in 1895, with Rolfe playing Rufus Dawes, Alfred Dampier as Reverend North, and Lily Dampier as Sylvia Vickers.Fotheringham p 49 The play structured the story to emphasise the role of Reverend North. The critic from the Sydney Morning Herald described it as: > Inferior to Robbery Under Arms [another novel adapted by Dampier] as regards > dialogue and construction, the characters are for the most part the merest > puppets of melodrama, and the dramatic situations are far from convincing. > Against all this, on the other hand, the play has to its credit the > advantage of an intricate plot clearly set out, of rapid action of a > sensational kind and two of three beautiful tableaux – elements of good > which caused it to be welcomed on Saturday with the most extravagant > expressions of delight. This play was often revived over the next few years. Alfred Dampier's last performance on stage was as Reverend North in a production of the play on 10 November 1905.Fotheringham p 55 The play was still being revived in 1912 and 1913. Production It is likely the film was retitled to avoid confusion with another movie version of the novel that had been released in 1908.Fotheringham p58 Raymond Longford worked on the movie and later claimed to have been the actual director. It appears from contemporary reviews that there was some filming at Port Arthur. Scenes involving Raymond Longford, who played Gabbett, were shot at La Perouse, Sydney. According to a later article in Everyone's: > Longford, stripped to the waist, tattered and blood bespattered, was at the > head of a cliff many yards away from the camera and the rest of the company, > who were preparing to scale the cliff to attempt his capture. Longford > forgot that he would be visible to those on the other side of the cliff, and > was startled to hear a piercing shriek and turned in time to see a woman on > the beach below, running as though for her life. He signalled to the others > to stop the action, which they did, thinking that something had gone wrong. > Longford then turned around to see it he could appease the woman’s alarm. > She was not to be seen, but creeping towards him in single file he saw some > fishermen and stragglers, armed with sticks, oars and any handy weapon. The > position looked ugly, and he reckoned he was in for a bad time, so rising to > his feet, he gave a hail, intending to reassure the attackers that all was > well. As soon as they caught sight of him and his accrutrements they dropped > their weapons and incontinently fled. After that scouts were posted around > the locations to warn sightseers what they might expect to see. Release The film was released in Sydney on 19 June 1911 at the Broadway Theatre. It was released in Melbourne on 27 November 1911 at the Olympic Theatre. It debuted in Launceston on 22 January 1912. (During the Launceston season, the film caught fire one night and the theatre had to be evacuated.) Distribution of the film was blocked from legal action by Marcus Clarke's daughter, Marion Clarke.http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/movingpicturewor30newy_0780 =Critical reception= The Sydney Truth called it \\"a striking production\\".

He is part Purépecha. Ponce currently owns and is the main driver for World Rally Team based out of Arendal, Norway. Rock crawling Ponce began participating in off-road racing in 2002 in Mexico at the Ramsey Off Road Challenge events. Ponce introduced the motorsport of professional rock crawling into Mexico by organizing and promoting UROC México in 2006. In 2006, Ponce became the first Mexican to participate and finish at the UROC (United Rock Crawling and Off Road Challenge) Super Crawl VI Extreme Rock Crawling World Championship held in Phoenix, Arizona, at the Firebird International Raceway. In 2007, he founded and promoted MXRRA (Mexico Rock Racing Association), an event sanctioned by XRRA, held in Guanajuato, México. During 2007-2009 Ponce also attended various Texas trail runs to continue promotion of his US-sanctioned rock crawling and rock racing events that were held in Mexico. Ponce co-drove alongside Tore Hansen, Norwegian off road champion, in the Nordic and Euro Trials of Norway in 2007 and 2008, finishing fourth on both occasions. Ponce and co-driver Johnny Despain placed third in the modified class at the MOROC Rock Race 2009 held in Spring, Texas. Rallying Ponce participated in the 2008 Rally México, placing 26th from 29 finishers overall, eighth from 11 finishers in class A6, and 2nd in the Reto Peugeot 206 Mexican Class. He was named rookie driver amongst the Mexican teams and awarded the Bernardo Audibert Cup. Ponce had no previous rally experience, and raced in a rental Peugeot 206 XS with street tires. In 2009, Ponce raced as the first Mexican to ever participate at the VENEZUELA Fun Race, a race held in the amazon jungle in Venezuela. Ponce navigated Team Roberti to a 16th spot of out 200 teams. In 2010 Ponce returned with co-driver Bill Bridge to race once again at WRC Rally México 2010. He finished 25th from 25 finishers in general classification and a 2nd place from 2 finishers in class A6.http://www.wrc.com/results/2010/corona-rally-mexico/final-results/ In 2012, Ponce drove for Team WERK1 along with the Paris Dakar Legend Jutta Kleinschmidt and Michael R. Podlogar at the GORM (German Off Road Masters) 24 hour race in Germany. Ponce raced a total of 14 laps out of 40 for Team WERK1 to place 5th in Class T2 and 16th overall. This was the first time a Mexican American competed in this endurance race known to many as the Nürburgring of off road racing in Germany. Desert rock racing In 2009, Ponce participated with teammates Heath Catron and Johnny Despain in the last chance qualifier at the King of the Hammers. In, 2010, he tried the LCQ once again with teammate Bill Bridge In 2011, Ponce along with teammate Dave Gutwillig finished the King of the Hammers, placing 37th out of 100 teams. Ponce was the first Mexican to ever compete in and finish this endurance race. The Ultra 4 race vehicle was built by Dave Gutwillig and sponsored by Javier Ibarra. Acting career Ponce was discovered in 2011 by Discovery Channel UK after being the first and only Mexican to finish the King of the Hammers and 2 WRC Mexico events with a super low budget. He was selected as one of the finalist to appear in the show One Car Too Far but the producers changed the concept of that show and later offered Ponce a bilingual host spot on another project entitled Brains vs Brawns, but Discovery Channel cancelled that project. After this Ponce took on the stage name Hotrod Ponce as part of his marketing strategy in the film world. All this helped open some doors to new projects and in 2014 he was promoted by some private elite contacts to appear in the UK film, Gatwick Gangsters, where he played the role of an international cartel leader hiding in Norway alongside real life gangsters like Dave Courtney. In the fall of 2014, Ponce began to write, direct and film The Ultimate Rally, a movie based on the truth about racing as an underdog racer and his real life adventures. At this time Ponce was residing in Norway and began to film there using his own vehicles and friends. In 2015, he continued to film on the border of Texas and in exotic places in Mexico and Belize until he finished in 2017. Unlike other Hollywood films Ponce modified and prepped all the vehicles that appear in this indie action film with the help of parts sponsored by his race partners. He also planned and performed all the stunts. He brainstormed the idea of using no actors and no camera crew to tell his unique documentary story which featured Norwegian, Spanish, Slovenian, English languages giving it an international appeal. The film has been released on Vimeo on deman on January 1, 2018 and dedicated to his younger brother and guitar legend, Louie Guitmousse Ponce.  Filmography  * Gatwick Gangsters (2017) ...

Filming was completed by early July 1911. Ethel Phillips later married her co- star Stanley Walpole. Reception One critic praised the movie saying \\"apart from its thrilling Incident, the film was particularly instructive to those without knowledge of the wild Australian aboriginal, as it showed them the grotesqueness of an indigenous blackfellow when in full warpaint.\\" The Advertiser called it: > highly exciting drama. The scenes are thoroughly Australian, and typical of > the bush and backblock township life of Queensland, where the incidents of > the drama were carried out. A strangely fantastic effect was obtained by the > introduction of a tribe of genuine Australian alboriginals, whose grotesque > war-painted bodies added to their weird corroborées.

Charles Villiers later recalled: > When that film was screened in Sydney I met a movie fan who I knew very > well. He had seen the picture; and I asked – him what he thought of it. 'Oh, > not bad,' he replied, 'but the make-up of the Johnnies who did the niggers > was not too good – it wouldn't deceive an Australian.'

It was directed by Charles W. Broun, Jr., Joel Holt and Arthur Knight. The film was released with an X rating (\\"for adults only\\") due to its adult content and nudity. Synopsis The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield began production in 1964 and continued shooting sporadically through 1967 as the budget was limited. The film consists of Mansfield visiting various locations throughout Europe and the United States. The European footage, shot in Rome and Paris, features Mansfield observing Italian roadside prostitutes, running from the paparazzi and attending the Cannes Film Festival. She is also filmed visiting \\"unusual\\" European locations such as a French naturist community, strip clubs, a gay bar and a massage parlor. The footage shot in the United States features Mansfield judging a transvestite beauty pageant in New York City along with footage of dancers at a Los Angeles topless bar. Musical performances by the all-girl topless band The Ladybirds(es) and Rocky Roberts & The Airedales (to which Mansfield does the Twist) are also included. Rounding out the film are clips of Mansfield's nude scenes from the 1963 sex comedy Promises! Promises!, the 1964 Italian film Primitive Love, and shots of her Playboy magazine pictorial. Production ceased after Mansfield died in a car accident in June 1967. Upon her death, the film's producers added news footage about her death and photographs from the scene of her fatal car accident. The film concludes with a tour of Mansfield's Los Angeles home, the Pink Palace, given by her ex- husband Mickey Hargitay and a video tribute. Production notes Working titles for the film include Jayne Mansfield Reports, Mansfield Reports Europe and Mansfield By Night. As the film was edited and released after Mansfield's death, actress Carolyn De Fonseca (who was Mansfield's official voice dubber for European productions) was hired to mimic Mansfield's voice for the narration. Distributed by Blue Ribbons Pictures, The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield premiered on April 18, 1968 in New Orleans.

MicroRNAs are typically transcribed as ~70 nucleotide precursors and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22 nucleotide product. The excised region or, mature product, of the miR-27 precursor is the microRNA mir-27. Herpesvirus saimiri expresses several non-coding RNAs (HSURs) which have been found to significantly reduce the level of mir-27 in a host cell. It has been proposed that miR-27 operates together with miR-23 and mir-24 in a co-operative cluster. Regulation of adipocyte differentiation miR-27 is one of a number of microRNAs implicated in cholesterol homeostasis and fatty acid metabolism. The miR-27 gene family has been shown to be downregulated during the differentiation of adipocytes. miR-27 inhibits adipocyte formation when overexpressed, acting by blocking the expression of two main regulators of adipogenesis. MicroRNAs miR-27a and -27b have been found to negatively regulate adipocyte differentiation through regulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) post-transcriptionally, as well as C/EBP alpha in the case of miR-27b. miR-27 can be identified both as an adipogenic inhibitor and as playing an important role in the development of obesity. Wnt signalling pathway miR-27 is an activator of the Wnt signalling pathway, affecting the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts. miR-27 has been found to target and inhibit gene expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, enabling it to regulate osteoblast differentiation. Expression levels of miR-27 are positively correlated with beta-catenin, a key protein in Wnt signalling. There is activation of Wnt signalling through nuclear accumulation of this protein, which is in response to inhibition of the beta-catenin destruction complex. This in turn is brought about by APC inhibition of miR-27. Cancer Regulation miR-27 is known to regulate components involved in numerous types of cancer, including breast and ovarian. miR-27a has been identified as an oncogenic microRNA and, specifically, is highly expressed in breast cancer cells. mir-27b expression is associated with survival in triple negative breast cancer patients. Inhibition of miR-27 by antisense molecules decreases cell proliferation. Antisense RNA directed against miR-27a has been shown to decrease the percentage of cells in S phase whilst also increasing those in the G2-M phase. The FOXO (Forkhead Box O) gene sub-family encodes tumour- suppressive transcription factors that regulate multiple aspects of cell cycle progression and survival. FOXO1 protein expression is down-regulated in breast tumour tissue samples; miR-27a has been identified as one of three miRNAS (along with miR-96 and miR-182) which directly target FOXO1 and regulate its endogenous expression. Suppression of miR-27a results in a FOXO1 protein increase and a consequent cell number decrease.

Life  Otto was the eldest son of the Duke Otto I of Brunswick- Harburg (1495–1549) from his marriage to Metta von Campen (died 1580). Otto received a princely education. The House of Brunswick-Lüneburg did not recognize Otto's right to inherit his father's lordship on the grounds that the marriage between his parents had been morganatic. Supported by Emperor Ferdinand I, Otto repeatedly renewed his demands and in 1560, he was finally confirmed as his father's successor as ruler of the Lordship of Harburg. His territory was even extended with neighbouring Moisburg. Otto continued his father's construction project at Harburg Castle and transformed it into a princely residence. He moved in permanently in 1551. In 1560, he began developing the castle chapel. To finance his activities, he raised taxes and levied special taxes, which led to dissatisfaction. From 1561 to 1577, the population of his territory shrank, due to the plague. Otto did not allow Jews and Christians of other denominations to settle in his country. He built a salt magazine, in order to promote the salt trade with Lüneburg. This, however, did not enjoy the success he had expected.  Marriages and issue  On 8 September 1551, Otto married his first wife, Margaret (1530–1559), daughter of Count John Henry of Schwarzburg-Leutenberg. She died in childbirth on 16 March 1559.

It is unquestionably one of the most thorough and most interesting of the Australian Photo-Play Company's productions, and a stirring dramatic story.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald said the film \\"does not depend on that scene [the Melbourne cup] for its interest, the human side of the drama, where all the varying emotions are admirably portrayed, being absorbing.\\" The Evening News called it a \\"splendid picture\\".

The stadium has a capacity of 21,800. History The Stadio Nuovo Romagnoli was designed by former Ascoli Calcio 1898 chairman Constantino Rozzi, who also designed numerous other stadiums across Italy. Work started on the stadium in 1983, and Stadio Nuovo Romagnoli was officially opened on 13 February 1985, when Campobasso played against Juventus F.C. in a Coppa Italia match.Campobasso - Juventus: 1-0, 13/02/1985 (in Italian) Campobasso won 1-0. The structure of the stadium is very similar to that of the Stadio Ciro Vigorito in Benevento, due to the same project and some of the same architects being involved in the Romagnoli's design. The stadium is called \\"New Romagnoli\\" because Campobasso's previous stadium was named after Giovanni Romagnoli. However, the stadium has not yet received an official name.Stadio: Forza Campobasso There has been talk of naming the stadium after Michele Scorrano, Campobasso's captain in the 1970s and 1980s,Stadio: Scorrano - Al Via una Raccolta di Firme who died after a heart attack in February 2009. After Napoli FC's San Paolo Stadium was damaged by a violent storm, Stadio Nuovo Romagnoli hosted the club's home matches between September 2001 and January 2002.

Established in 1859 and initially known as \\"The Wellington Reformatory Farm School\\", the school was the creation of \\"The Edinburgh Association for the Reformation of Juvenile Offenders\\"; one of the founding members of the association was the Rev. Dr. Thomas Guthrie. The Wellington Reformatory Farm School sprang from thinking similar to that which created the reform school developments in the United States. The school admitted its first pupil in February 1860: James Watt, aged eleven years. James had been convicted at The Police Court of Edinburgh and sentenced by Sheriff Hallard to fourteen days' imprisonment and thereafter five years' detention at the Reformatory School. James's crime had been the \\"theft of a bottle of hair oil from off a barrow on the street\\". James had had no previous convictions. Although the word \\"Farm\\" was dropped from the school's name many years ago, it was still often referred to in Edinburgh as \\"Wellie Farm\\". In 2013 the decision was made by council officials that the school should shut because of falling numbers. After 153 years the school closed in June 2014. The school's War Memorial listing those of its pupils whose lives were lost in the Great War is to be lodged in Penicuik South Parish Church. The school archive has been preserved for posterity including admission papers which stretch back to the first pupils, correspondence from former pupils and the medical register. Many of the records have gone to the City of Edinburgh Archive, whilst some are held by the Penicuik Historical Society. In August 2014 confidential files were found unsecured in the building. The school motto was \\"Resurgam\\" and the crest was a phoenix above a saltire.

However, May is in love with a handsome young miner named Dick Taylor. Flood induces Dick to play a game of poker, and while the game is proceeding, Dick sees Flood slip four cards up his sleeve. Dick immediately rises and calls Flood a cheat; the latter draws a revolver and points it at Dick. A fight ensues; the revolver goes off, but nobody is hurt, and at last Dick secures the weapon, calmly takes the cartridges out, and returns it to Flood. Dick then challenges Flood to fight him. Flood accepts and they go outside, where Dick punches out Flood. Tess Jones, who loves Flood, tries to cheer him up but he hits her. A few days later Flood follows May into the bush and attempts to kiss her, but Dick has followed, and Flood is forced to flee. Flood and three accomplices arrange to stick up a gold escort, and their plan is overheard by May and her little brother Jack. The men see May and seize her, but Jack hides behind a tree and isn't discovered. They take May with them, and after they are gone, Jack comes out from his hiding place and runs home, where he tells his parents and the miners what has happened. The miners, led by Dick, start out in pursuit. May is tied to a tree and left there while Flood and his party leave for the location where they plan to attack the escort. A tree is felled across the track, and the men await the arrival of the escort. A mounted trooper appears and rides up to the tree and dismounts. As he does so, Flood hits him over the head, stunning him, then drags him into the bush. They are just in time, for the coach comes swinging around a bend, the driver pulling up as he gets to the fallen tree. Flood and his companions open fire, two troopers fall, and the others surrender. The robbers overturn the coach and drive the horses into the bush. While getting out the gold boxes and mail bags, Dick and the miners ride up, firing a volley as they do so, and the men, with the exception of Flood, are captured. Flood slips away in the excitement, returning to where his horse was left. He makes his escape, although the miners are close behind. A week later Dick and May are to be married. In the meantime Flood, who has evaded capture, returns to the township to have revenge on Dick, although Tess tries to dissuade him. The wedding day arrives, and as per Dick's wish they are married in the bush. The minister has just made them one, when Flood rushes in, revolver in hand. Just as he fires, Tess steps forward and receives the bullet meant for Dick. The miners seize Flood and nearly tear him to pieces before handing him over to the police.

Geebung arrives at the homestead immediately after Clarice's rejection of Tracey, who vents his wrath on Geebung by whipping him. Dick arrives and rescues Geebung. Tracey is about to rush on Dick when Clarice interferes, asking for an explanation. Dick and Tracey remain silent, but Geebung tells her what happened. Tracey swears revenge on Dick. He soon finds his chance with an order to send sheep to Flemington Saleyards. Tracey forges an entry in the railway book to make it appear that Dick has stolen 200 sheep. He is seen by Geebung, whom he shoots, then tells Mrs. Inglehurst of Dick's dishonesty. Dick is arrested, but Geebung, who has been found by Clarice, arrives in time to free Dick. Tracey escapes and goes to Sydney, where he meets Tilly, who is an old friend, and they resolve to ruin Dick and Clarice on their wedding day.

It is found in western North America. Its population periodically irrupts in cyclical outbreaks. The caterpillars feed on the needles of Douglas fir, true fir, and spruce in summer, and moths are on the wing from July or August to November. Description Adult males are grayish brown moths with mottled light and dark markings. The males' wingspread is . When the wings are spread open, the brown hindwings can be seen. Individuals in the northern part of its range are darker and southern populations are lighter. Antennae are plumose (feathery). Females are flightless with only rudimentary wings. Larvae (caterpillars) are and colorful with red spots, white spines, conspicuous red-tipped white tufts or \\"tussocks\\", and dense bunches of long, black hairs projecting to the front and behind. Range and host plants The Douglas-fir tussock moth is native to forests of western North America and outbreaks have been identified in British Columbia, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Outbreaks occur in cycles around eight to twelve years and usually last up to four years, sometimes longer. Reports from Idaho and Washington indicate 2011 had a major outbreak. The larvae feed on Pseudotsuga and Abies species, especially Douglas fir, grand fir, white fir, and subalpine fir. Life cycle Eggs hatch in spring (May to June) and the young larvae begin feeding on new foliage (the current season’s growth of needles). Later, they feed on both new and old foliage. The movement of the caterpillars is the main means of biological dispersal. They produce long, silky threads which can catch the wind when they drop from one branch to another. They produce loose webbing which forms a netting. In this cocoon, they pupate in July or August. Adults emerge and are active as late as November. The flightless females stay near the cocoons from which they emerged and mate straight away. Eggs are spherical and white and are laid in a mass which protects them through winter. Because the female is sedentary, population outbreaks always form in place. Management One key to management of outbreaks is detection. Entomologists monitor forests using an early warning system of pheromone traps. Outbreaks subside on their own, but silvicultural techniques for managing affected timber can be employed, or the chemical carbaryl can be sprayed aerially.

It depicts a man wearing a beret and holding a piece of paper against a red background. The oil on panel painting is dated 1521 and is in the collection of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister of Dresden, Germany.Albrecht Dürer, Portrait of Bernhart von Reesen at Google Arts and Culture Background and details The painting was executed during the artist's trip to the Low Countries in the period 1520–1521. On 16 March 1521, Dürer wrote in his diary that he had portrayed in Antwerp one Bernhart von Reesen, for which he was paid eight florins and some small gifts for his wife and maid. The sitter is portrayed wearing black garments and a white shirt. His hands, which, according to the Flemish painting tradition, are cut of on the lower border, hold a small piece of paper with writing on it. Dürer's portrait mixes traits of Netherlandish portraiture tradition with the Venetian tradition. The sitter is shown in three-quarter profile set against a red background. The portrait which shows the sitter from close up accentuates the bright face and the large beret. The face is angular but softened through delicate modelling. Von Reesen is depicted as powerful and confident but his gaze turned to the left in the distance gives his pose at the same time a contemplative quality. The composition is dominated by diagonal lines which give the portrait an intense quality.The Splendor of Dresden, Five Centuries of Art Collecting: An Exhibition from the State Art Collections of Dresden,, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1978, p. 219-220 Identification of the sitter The sitter for the portrait has been identified on the basis of the letter he is holding in his hands and the entry in Dürer's diary. Although the writing is hard to make out, it has been determined that the man should be identified with Bernhard von Reesen. Von Reesen was a successful merchant from Gdańsk who was living in Antwerp at the time. He was thirty years old when the portrait was painted. He died the same year. Some scholars have identified the sitter in the past with the Flemish painter Bernard van Orley from Brussels whom Dürer met during his stay in Brussels. This view was debunked in 1972 by Dr. Erna Brand who conclusively showed that the sitter was in fact Bernhard von Reesen.Erna Brand, Untersuchungen zu Albrecht Dürers Bildnis eines jungen Mannes, in: Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Jahrbuch 1970/71, Dresden, 1972, pp. 59-83 References External links * Category:1521 paintings Reesen Reesen Category:Collections of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister ","title":"Portrait of Bernhart von Reesen"},{"id":"32987643","text":"The Love Tyrant is a 1912 Australian silent film directed by Alfred Rolfe.

The Act has provisions to provide fair compensation to those whose land is taken away, brings transparency to the process of acquisition of land to set up factories or buildings, infrastructural projects and assures rehabilitation of those affected. The Act establishes regulations for land acquisition as a part of India's massive industrialisation drive driven by public-private partnership. The Act replaced the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, a nearly 120-year-old law enacted during British rule. The Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2011 was introduced in Lok Sabha on 7 September 2011.http://www.ndtv.com/article/array/cabinet-clears-land-acquisition-and- rehabilitation-bill-131514http://www.hindustantimes.com/rssfeed/NewDelhi/Land- Acquisition-Bill-introduced-in-Lok-Sabha/Article1-742576.aspx The bill was then passed by it on 29 August 2013 and by Rajya Sabha on 4 September 2013. The bill then received the assent of the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee on 27 September 2013. The Act came into force from 1 January 2014. An amendment bill was then introduced in Parliament to endorse the Ordinance. Lok Sabha passed the bill but the same is still lying for passage by the Rajya Sabha. On 30 May 2015, President of India promulgated the amendment ordinance for third time. Background =History= The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was a law passed by the Imperial Legislative Council, that governed the process of land acquisition in India until 2013 and continues to do so in Pakistan and Myanmar. It allows the acquisition of land for some public purpose by a government agency from individual landowners after paying a government-determined compensation to cover losses incurred by landowners from surrendering their land to the agency. In India, a new Act, The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, replaced this law. =Need= The Government of India believed there was a heightened public concern on land acquisition issues in India. Of particular concern was that despite many amendments, over the years, to India's Land Acquisition Act of 1894, there was an absence of a cohesive national law that addressed fair compensation when private land is acquired for public use, and fair rehabilitation of land owners and those directly affected from loss of livelihoods. The Government of India believed that a combined law was necessary, one that legally requires rehabilitation and resettlement necessarily and simultaneously follow government acquisition of land for public purposes. Forty-Fourth Amendment Act of 1978 omitted Art 19(1) (f) with the net result being:- # The right not to be deprived of one's property save by authority of law has since been no longer a fundamental right. \\"No person shall be deprived of his property saved by authority of law\\" (Constitution 44th Amendment, w.e.f. 10.6.1979). The amendment ensured that the right to property‟ is no more a fundamental right but rather a constitutional/legal right/as a statutory right and in the event of breach, the remedy available to an aggrieved person is through the High Court under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution and not the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. . # Moreover, no one can challenge the reasonableness of the restriction imposed by any law the legislature made to deprive the person of his property. State must pay compensation at the market value for such land, building or structure acquired (Inserted by Constitution, Seventeenth Amendment Act, 1964), the same can be found in the earlier rulings when property right was a fundamental right (such as 1954 AIR 170, 1954 SCR 558, which propounded that the word \\"Compensation\\" deployed in Article 31(2) implied full compensation, that is the market value of the property at the time of the acquisition. The Legislature must \\"ensure that what is determined as payable must be compensation, that is, a just equivalent of what the owner has been deprived of\\"). Elsewhere, Justice, Reddy, O Chinnappa ruled (State Of Maharashtra v. Chandrabhan Tale on 7 July 1983) that the fundamental right to property has been abolished because of its incompatibility with the goals of \\"justice\\" social, economic and political and \\"equality of status and of opportunity\\" and with the establishment of \\"a socialist democratic republic, as contemplated by the Constitution. There is no reason why a new concept of property should be introduced in the place of the old so as to bring in its wake the vestiges of the doctrine of Laissez Faire and create, in the name of efficiency, a new oligarchy. Efficiency has many facets and one is yet to discover an infallible test of efficiency to suit the widely differing needs of a developing society such as ours\\" (1983 AIR 803, 1983 SCR (3) 327) (Dey Biswas 2014, 14-15 footnote). The Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2011 was introduced in Lok Sabha. Two Bills on similar lines were introduced in Lok Sabha in 2007. These Bills lapsed with the dissolution of the 14th Lok Sabha. Aims and objectives The aims and objectives of the Act include: * To ensure, in consultation with institutions of local self-government and Gram Sabhas established under the Constitution of India, a humane, participative, informed and transparent process for land acquisition for industrialisation, development of essential infrastructural facilities and urbanisation with the least disturbance to the owners of the land and other affected families * Provide just and fair compensation to the affected families whose land has been acquired or proposed to be acquired or are affected by such acquisition * Make adequate provisions for such affected persons for their rehabilitation and resettlement * Ensure that the cumulative outcome of compulsory acquisition should be that affected persons become partners in development leading to an improvement in their post acquisition social and economic status and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Purpose and scope The Act aims to establish the law on land acquisition, as well as the rehabilitation and resettlement of those directly affected by the land acquisition in India. The scope of the Act includes all land acquisition whether it is done by the Central Government of India, or any State Government of India. The Act is applicable when: *Government acquires land for its own use, hold and control, including land for Public sector undertakings. *Government acquires land with the ultimate purpose to transfer it for the use of private companies for stated public purpose. The purpose of LARR 2011 includes public-private-partnership projects, but excludes land acquired for state or national highway projects. *Government acquires land for immediate and declared use by private companies for public purpose. The provisions of the Act does not apply to acquisitions under 16 existing legislations including the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005, the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, the Railways Act, 1989, etc. Provisions =Definition of public purpose= Section 2(1) of the Act defines the following as public purpose for land acquisition within India: * For strategic purposes relating to naval, military, air force, and armed forces of the Union, including central paramilitary forces or any work vital to national security or defence of India or State police, safety of the people; or * For infrastructure projects, which includes the following, namely: ** All activities or items listed in the notification of the Government of India in the Department of Economic Affairs (Infrastructure Section) number 13/6/2009-INF, dated 27 March 2012, excluding private hospitals, private educational institutions and private hotels; ** Projects involving agro-processing, supply of inputs to agriculture, warehousing, cold storage facilities, marketing infrastructure for agriculture and allied activities such as dairy, fisheries, and meat processing, set up or owned by the appropriate Government or by a farmers' cooperative or by an institution set up under a statute; ** Project for industrial corridors or mining activities, national investment and manufacturing zones, as designated in the National Manufacturing Policy; ** Project for water harvesting and water conservation structures, sanitation; ** Project for Government administered, Government aided educational and research schemes or institutions; ** Project for sports, health care, tourism, transportation of space programme; ** Any infrastructure facility as may be notified in this regard by the Central Government and after tabling of such notification in Parliament; * Project for project affected families; * Project for housing, or such income groups, as may be specified from time to time by the appropriate Government; * Project for planned development or the improvement of village sites or any site in the urban areas or provision of land for residential purposes for the weaker sections in rural and urban areas; * Project for residential purposes to the poor or landless or to persons residing in areas affected by natural calamities, or to persons displaced or affected by reason of the implementation of any scheme undertaken by the Government, any local authority or a corporation owned or controlled by the State. When government declares public purpose and shall control the land directly, consent of the land owner shall not be required. However, when the government acquires the land for private companies, the consent of at least 80% of the project affected families shall be obtained through a prior informed process before government uses its power under the Act to acquire the remaining land for public good, and in case of a public-private project at least 70% of the affected families should consent to the acquisition process.Section 2(2) of the Act The Act includes an urgency clause for expedited land acquisition. The urgency clause may only be invoked for national defense, security and in the event of rehabilitation of affected people from natural disasters or emergencies. =Definition of 'land owner'= The Act defines the following as land owner: # person whose name is recorded as the owner of the land or building or part thereof, in the records of the authority concerned; or # person who is granted forest rights under The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 or under any other law for the time being in force; or # Person who is entitled to be granted Patta rights on the land under any law of the State including assigned lands; or # any person who has been declared as such by an order of the court or Authority; =Limits on acquisition= The Act forbids land acquisition when such acquisition would include multi-crop irrigated area. However such acquisition may be permitted on demonstrable last resort, which will be subjected to an aggregated upper limit for all the projects in a District or State as notified by the State Government. In addition to the above condition, wherever multi-crop irrigated land is acquired an equivalent area of cultivable wasteland shall be developed by the state for agricultural purposes. In other type of agricultural land, the total acquisition shall not exceed the limit for all the projects in a District or State as notified by the Appropriate Authority. These limits shall not apply to linear projects which includes projects for railways, highways, major district roads, power lines, and irrigation canals.Section 10 of the Act Compensation Section 26 of the Act defines the method by which market value of the land shall be computed under the proposed law. Schedule I outlines the proposed minimum compensation based on a multiple of market value. Schedule II through VI outline the resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements to land owners and livelihood losers, which shall be in addition to the minimum compensation per Schedule I. =Market value= The market value of the proposed land to be acquired, shall be set as the higher of: *the minimum land value, if any, specified in the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 for the registration of sale deeds in the area, where the land is situated; or *the average of the sale price for similar type of land being acquired, ascertained from the highest fifty per cent of the sale deeds registered during the preceding three years in the nearest village or nearest vicinity of the land being acquired.; or * the consented amount in case the land is acquired for private companies or public- private partnership projects. The market value would be multiplied by a factor of, at least one to two times the market value for land acquired in rural areas and at least one times the market value for land acquired in urban areas. The Act stipulates that the minimum compensation to be a multiple of the total of above ascertained market value, value to assets attached to the property, plus a solatium equal to 100 percent of the market value of the property including value of assets. In addition to above compensation, the Act proposes a wide range of rehabilitation and resettlement entitlements to land owners and livelihood losers from the land acquirer. Market value is often used interchangeably with open market value, fair value or fair market value, although these terms have distinct definitions in different standards, and may differ in some circumstances. =Rehabilitation and resettlement= For land owners, the Act provides: *an additional subsistence allowance of ₹38,000 (US$800) for the first year - may be *an additional entitlement of a job to the family member, or a payment of ₹5,00,000 (US$11,000) up front, or a monthly annuity totaling ₹24,000 (US$550) per year for 20 years with adjustment for inflation – the option from these three choices shall be the legal right of the affected land owner family, not the land acquirer *an additional upfront compensation of ₹50,000 (US$1,100) for transportation *an additional upfront resettlement allowance of ₹50,000(US$1,100) *if the land owner loses a home in a rural area, then an additional entitlement of a house with no less than 50 square meters in plinth area *if the land is acquired for urbanization, 20% of the developed land will be reserved and offered to land owning families, in proportion to their land acquired and at a price equal to cost of acquisition plus cost of subsequent development *if acquired land is resold without development, 20% of the appreciated land value shall be mandatorily shared with the original owner whose land was acquired In addition to the above compensation and entitlements under the proposed LARR 2011, scheduled caste and schedule tribe (SC/ST) families will be entitled to several other additional benefits per Schedule II of the proposed bill. India has over 250 million people protected and classified as SC/ST, about 22% of its total population. The proposed additional benefits to these families include: *an additional land grant of 2.5 acres per affected family *an additional assistance of ₹50,000 (US$1,100) *free land for community and social gatherings, and special Schedule V and VI benefits Schedule III of LARR 2011 proposes additional amenities over and beyond those outlined above. Schedule III proposes that the land acquirer shall provide 25 additional services to families affected by the land acquisition. Some examples of the 25 additional services include schools, health centres, roads, safe drinking water, child support services, places of worship, burial and cremation grounds, post offices, fair price shops, and storage facilities. LARR Bill 2011 proposes that Schedule II through VI shall apply even when private companies willingly buy land from willing sellers, without any involvement of the government. The Bill as drafted mandates compensation and entitlements without limit to number of claimants. Thus, for clarity and as an example, if 1000 acres of rural land is to be acquired for a project, with market price of ₹2,25,000 per acre (US$5000 per acre), 100 families claim to be land owners, and 5 families per acre claim their rights as livelihood losers under the proposed LARR 2011 Bill, the total cost to acquire the 1000 acre would be *Land compensation = ₹90,00,00,000 (US$20,000,000) *Land owner entitlements = ₹6,30,00,000 (US$1,400,000) + 100 replacement homes *Livelihood loser entitlements = ₹365,00,00,000 (US$70,000,000) + 5000 replacement homes The average effective cost of land, in the above example will be at least ₹41,00,000 (US$91,400) per acre plus replacement homes and additional services per Schedule III to VI of the proposed bill. Even if the pre-acquisition average market price for land were just ₹22,500 per acre (US$500 per acre) in the above example, the proposed R&R;, other entitlements and Schedule III to VI would raise the effective cost of land to at least ₹33,03,000 (US$73,400) per acre. The LARR Bill of 2011 proposes the above benchmarks as minimum. The state governments of India, or private companies, may choose to set and implement a policy that pays more than the minimum proposed by LARR 2011. For context purposes, the proposed land prices because of compensation and R&R; LARR 2011 may be compared with land prices elsewhere in the world: *According to The Financial Times, in 2008, the farmland prices in France were Euro 6,000 per hectare ($2,430 per acre; ₹1,09,350 per acre). *According to the United States Department of Agriculture, as of January 2010, the average farmland value in the United States was $2,140 per acre (₹96,300 per acre). The farmland prices in the United States varied between different parts of the country, ranging between $480 per acre to $4,690 per acre. A 2010 report by the Government of India, on labour whose livelihood depends on agricultural land, claims that, per 2009 data collected across all states in India, the all-India annual average daily wage rates in agricultural occupations ranged between ₹53 to 117 per day for men working in farms (US$354 to 780 per year), and between ₹41 to 72 per day for women working in farms (US$274 to 480 per year). This wage rate in rural India study included the following agricultural operations common in India: ploughing, sowing, weeding, transplanting, harvesting, winnowing, threshing, picking, herdsmen, tractor driver, unskilled help, mason, etc. =Issues and expectations regarding compensation= Issues 1\\\\. Compensation criteria is not understandable/clear 2\\\\. Compensation prices variation place to place 3\\\\. Compensation as per newly amended bill is not distributed (Under below mentioned circumstances) Example # Land acquired in the period bill is under discussion in parliament. # Not many changes are done in bill after parliamentary discussions and LARR 2011 bill passed with marginal changes. # Large land acquisition are done by government/others during the period bill is under discussion in parliament. # During this period LARR 2011 bill under discussion, Compensation is as per previous Land acquisition bill (Poor farmers lost their lands in unfair/ unfavorable condition) # Multiplication factors in rural and urban area are added rather than increasing the base Land cost (Land is most essential component for any infrastructure geographically, socially, economically, as per terrain available with/without resources) =Expectations= # Bill recommendation to be implemented as dated bill appeared in parliament.(2011) # Compensation should be time bound and to amount to be released with is a time frame / as per bill recommendations. # Fair compensation including life time productive income from land to Farmer/land owner (Till date he/she or family holding land) # Land Holding & maintenance cost to farmers/Land owners (as per current date land situation) till land acquired by government/others (As crop price are also not favorable to farmers in compression to other item in economy) Benefits and effects The 2013 Act is expected to affect rural families in India whose primary livelihood is derived from farms. The Act will also affect urban households in India whose land or property is acquired. Per an April 2010 report, over 50% of Indian population (about 60 crore people) derived its livelihood from farm lands. With an average rural household size of 5.5, LARR Bill 2011 R&R; entitlement benefits may apply to about 10.9 crore rural households in India. According to Government of India, the contribution of agriculture to Indian economy's gross domestic product has been steadily dropping with every decade since its independence. As of 2009, about 15.7% of India's GDP is derived from agriculture. Act will mandate higher payments for land as well as guaranteed entitlements from India's non-agriculture-derived GDP to the people supported by agriculture-derived GDP. It is expected that the Act will directly affect 13.2 crore hectares (32.6 crore acres) of rural land in India, over 10 crore land owners, with an average land holding of about 3 acres per land owner. Families whose livelihood depends on farming land, the number of livelihood- dependent families per acre varies widely from season to season, demands of the land, and the nature of crop. Act provides to compensate rural households – both land owners and livelihood losers. The Act goes beyond compensation, it mandates guaranteed series of entitlements to rural households affected. According to a July 2011 report from the Government of India, the average rural household per capita expenditure/income in 2010, was ₹928 per month (US$252 per year). For a typical rural household that owns the average of 3 acres of land, the Act will replace the loss of annual average per capita income of ₹11,136 for the rural household, with: *four times the market value of the land, and *an upfront payment of ₹1,36,000 (US$3,000) for subsistence, transportation and resettlement allowances, and *an additional entitlement of a job to the family member, or a payment of ₹5,00,000 (US$11,000) up front, or a monthly annuity totaling ₹24,000 (US$550) per year for 20 years with adjustment for inflation – the option from these three choices shall be the legal right of the affected land owner family, not the land acquirer, and *a house with no less than 50 square meters in plinth area, and *additional benefits may apply if the land is resold without development, used for urbanization, or if the land owner belongs to SC/ST or other protected groups per rules of the Government of India If the affected families on the above rural land demand 100% upfront compensation from the land acquirer, and the market value of land is ₹1,00,000 per acre, the Act mandates the land acquirer to offset the loss of an average per capita 2010 income of ₹11,136 per year created by this 3 acre of rural land, with the following: *₹18,36,000 (US$41,727) to the rural land owner; which is the total of R&R; allowances of ₹6,36,000 plus ₹12,00,000 – which is four times the market value of the land, plus *a house with no less than 50 square metres in plinth area and benefits from Schedule III-VI as applicable to the rural land owner, plus *additional payments of ₹6,36,000 each to any additional families claiming to have lost its livelihood because of the acquisition, even if they do not own the land The effects of LARR Bill 2011, in certain cases, will apply retroactively to pending and incomplete projects. land acquisition for all linear projects such as highways, irrigation canals, railways, ports and others. Criticisms The proposed Bill, LARR 2011, is being criticized on a number of fronts: * Some criticize the Act citing that it is heavily loaded in favour of land owners and ignores the needs of poor Indians who need affordable housing, impoverished families who need affordable hospitals, schools, employment opportunities and infrastructure and industries. *Some economists suggest that it attaches an arbitrary mark-up to the historical market price to determine compensation amounts, along with its numerous entitlements to potentially unlimited number of claimants. This according to them shall guarantee neither social justice nor the efficient use of resources. *LARR 2011 as proposed mandates that compensation and rehabilitation payments to land owners and livelihood losers be upfront. This misaligns the interests of land acquirer and those affected. Once the payment is made, one or more of the affected families may seek to delay the progress of the project to extract additional compensation, thereby adversely affecting those who chose long term employment in the affected families. The Bill, these economists suggest, should link compensation and entitlements to the progress and success of the project, such as through partial compensation in form of land bonds. These success-linked infrastructure bonds may also help poor states reduce the upfront cost of land acquisition for essential public projects such as hospitals, schools, universities, affordable housing, clean drinking water treatment plants, electricity power generation plants, sewage treatment plants, flood control reservoirs, and highways necessary to bring relief to affected public during fires, epidemics, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters. The state of Kerala has decided to pursue the use of infrastructure bonds as a form of payment to land owners. *LARR 2011 places no limit on total compensation or number of claimants; nor does it place any statute of limitations on claims or claimants. The beneficiaries of the Bill, with guaranteed jobs for 26 years, will have no incentive to be productive. The Bill should place a limit on total value of entitlement benefits that can be annually claimed per acre, this entitlement pool should then be divided between the affected families, and the government should run this program if it is considered to be fair. *LARR 2011 as proposed severely curtails free market transactions between willing sellers and willing buyers. For example, DLF Limited – India's largest real estate developer – claims that the current bill may limit private companies such as DLF from developing affordable housing for millions of Indians. DLF suggests that direct land transactions with owners on a willing voluntary basis, at market-determined rate, should be kept out of the purview of the bill. There should be no conditions imposed on free market transactions between willing sellers and willing buyers. *An article in The Wall Street Journal claims that the proposed LARR 2011 rules will apply even when any private company acquires 100 acres of land or more. For context, POSCO India seeks about 4000 acres for its US$12 billion proposed steel manufacturing plant in the Indian state of Orissa. In most cases, even small companies planning US$10-US$300 million investment, seeking 100 or more acres will be affected by the compensation plus rehabilitation effort and expenses of LARR 2011. The WSJ article further claims that the proposed LARR 2011 bill doesn't actually define the word \\"acquisition,\\" and leaves open a loophole that could allow government agencies to continue banking land indefinitely. *The Observer Research Foundation's Sahoo argues that the bill fails to adequately define \\"public purpose\\". The current definition, he claims, can be interpreted vaguely. In leaving public purpose too vague and porous, it would ensure that land acquisition will remain hostage to politics and all kinds of disputes. More clarity is needed, perhaps with the option that each state have the right to hold a referendum, whereby the voters in the state can vote to approve or disapprove proposed public purpose land acquisitions through the referendum, as is done through local elections in the United States for certain public acquisition of private or agricultural land. *The Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India claims that the proposed LARR 2011 bill is kind of one-sided, its ill-thought-out entitlements may sound very altruistic and pro-poor, but these are unsustainable and will kill the goose that lays the golden egg. This group further claims that the bill, if passed, will increase the cost of acquisition of land to unrealistic level. It will be almost impossible to acquire 50-acre or 100-acre land at one place for planned development. They suggest that if India does not facilitate urbanization in an organized manner, all the incremental population will be housed in disorganized housing developments such as slums with dire consequences for Indian economy. In the long run, even farmers will suffer as fringe development of urban centres will largely be in the form of unauthorized developments and they will not realize the true economic potential of their lands. *The bill inflates the cost of land to help a small minority of Indians at the cost of the vast majority of Indian citizens, as less than 10% of Indian population owns rural or urban land., The LARR Bill 2011 favours a privileged minority of land owners as the Bill mandates above market prices for their land plus an expensive rehabilitation package. The Bill does not mandate a process by which the time involved in land acquisition is reduced from current levels of years. Nor does the Bill consider the effect of excessive costs upfront, and expensive rehabilitation mandate over time, on the financial feasibility of large-scale, socially necessary infrastructure projects needed by 90%+ of Indians who are not landowners. In an editorial, Vidya Bala writes that the most important weakness in the Bill is bringing non-government transactions too under its purview. Private players buying 50+ acres of urban land tracts or 100+ acres of rural areas would be required to comply with the R&R; package stated in the Bill. *LARR 2011 Bill's sections 97, 98 and 99 are incongruous with other laws of India in details and intent. Section 98, for example, says that the provisions of the Bill shall not apply to the enactments relating to land acquisition specified in the Fourth Schedule of the Bill. According to Indian Legal Code, the Fourth Schedule referred to by LARR 2011 Bill, consists of 16 bills, including the ancient monuments and archaeological sites and remains Act, 1958, the atomic energy Act, 1962, the special economic zones Act, 2005, the cantonments Act, 2006, the railways Act, 1989 amongst others. Laws can not be in conflict with each other. LARR Bill carve outs through Sections 97, 98 and 99 add confusion, offering a means for numerous citizen petitions, lawsuits and judicial activism. The LARR 2011 Bill thus fails to deliver on the goals motivating it.

Biography Prince Dmitry Gorchakov was born in Kostroma Governorate, the only son of Prince Pyotr I. Gorchakov, member of an empoverished Russian aristocratic family, the Chernigov's line of Ryurikovichs. He received a high quality education at home, in 1768 joined the army, took part in Wallachian and Crimean campaigns but in 1782 (for reasons that remained unclear), retired to engage himself in agricultural activities in his Tula estate. It was in the early 1780s that he first started to write poetry. In 1790 Prince Gorchakov rejoined the Russian army as a volunteer, took part in the battle at Izmail, was seriously wounded and was praised for courage by Aleksandr Suvorov. In 1807 Gorchakov was made an honorary Russian Academy member. In 1807-1910 he served as a Governorate procurator in Pskov and Tavria, then as a high-ranked administrative official in the Moldovan army. In 1811 he became the member of an influential group known as Beseda (the Lovers of the Russian Word Meetings). In 1813 Gorchakov was appointed a vice-Governor of Kostroma, in 1816 he retired and moved to Moscow where he lived up until his death in 1824. Prince Dmitry Gorchakov was buried in the Danilov monastery in Moscow.  Works  Dmitry Gorchakov was best known for his comedy plays King for a Day (Калиф на час, Moscow, 1786), The Lucky Tonya (Счастливая тоня,Tonya (тоня) - a place for fishing. Moscow, 1786) and Baba Yaga (Баба-Яга, Kaluga, 1788). Based on Arab and Russian folklore, but featuring 'modern' characters (with 'character' names like podyachy Bribetakin), these works parodied ways of Russian petty officials, denouncing corruption, bribery and theft. Among his major influences were Gavrila Derzhavin and Nikolai Nikolev, the latter a close friend. It was the latter's anti-tyranny tragedy Sorena and Zamir that inspired Gorchakov to write in the late 1880s his pro-democracy, American-based tragedy which remained both untitled and unpublished. Another unpublished \\"comedy in verse\\", The Carefree One (Беспечный) was staged in 1799 in Saint Petersburgh. His novelet Plamir and Raida came out in 1796. A keen analyst of the European political affairs, Gorchakov in the early 1800s was regarded as the leading Russian satirist. Some of his poems were published in the Drug Prosveshchenya (Friend of Enlightenment) magazine in 1804-1806, more of the others circulated privately as hand-written manuscripts, best-known of which was The Epistle to Prince S.N.Dolgorukov which in many ways (notably by bringing to mind the famous Tchatsky's monologue) pre-empted Woe from Wit, Aleksander Griboyedov's 1823 classic. Young Aleksander Pushkin was much impressed by Prince Gorchakov’s works. In his 1815 poem Gorodok (Small Town) he mentioned him and his satires (\\"I love your needle-sharp verse...\\"). Tellingly, in 1828 amidst The Gabrieliad scandal, Pushkin tried to ascribe his \\"dirty\\" poem to Prince Gorchakov, then four years dead, trying to exploit the latter's reputation as the early 1800s Russia's major volnodumetz (\\"free-thinking man\\"). The first ever attempt to collect Gorchakov's legacy was made in 1890 by his granddaughter Princess Yelena Gorchakova who published The Works of D.P.Gorchakov (Сочинения Д.П. Горчакова). This volume was far from comprehensive, though: none of the earlier publications were included. Large part of Gorchakov's legacy has been lost: a bulk of his unpublished material along with numerous rough copies has perished in the fire that destroyed his country house, while some of poems he did publish remained anonymous.

The population in 2011 was 921,Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 12.88 km². History The Romans crossed these lands, building some bridges along the margins of the Dão River, near the thermal springs, possibly indicating their acknowledgement of the region's aesthetic importance. Alcafache has its origin in an Arab settlement, dating from the 13th century, whose toponymy evolved from Carafáche and later Alcaafáchi. The parish, which at one time was a municipality in its own right, received its first foral (charter) in 1514, during the reign of King Manuel I. The region was consecrated to the Order of Malta at that time, and included the places Casal Mendo, Casal Sendinho, Aldeia de Carvalho, Tibaldinho, Mosteirinho and Banho. The most emblematic symbol of this region is the thermal baths of Banho. Although, today, these thermae are situated in another municipality (Viseu), Alcafache is the location for many of the hotels and retreats associated with visitors to the thermal spas. Occupied intensely from April to November, the warm sulphur-rich waters are popular with elderly and those with rheumatism, muscular-skeletal illnesses and respiratory conditions (such as rhinitis and sinusitis). The thermal spas in the region were recognized as far back as the 15th century, when a shelter constructed by a deacon from the Sé Cathedral of Viseu, to gather the poor who needed this form of treatment. On 11 September 1985 a train crash occurred along the CP's Beira Alta railway line near Alcafache, resulting in the deaths of 56 passengers (officially), yet causing many still unaccounted for deaths. Geography Alcafache is located roughly halfway between the centres of Viseu and Nelas. Culture Alcafache is recognized for the hundred-year tradition of embroidery, the bordadados de Tibaldinho, which continue to be sought after for their quality. The regions age is also reflected in the Banda Filarmónica de Tibaldinho, the philharmonic band, that continue to play at many social events. Alcafache also constructed their Associação Cultural de Tibaldinho (Tibaldinho Cultural Association) and the Grupo Coral de Alcafache (Choral Group of Alcafache), two entities that attract local participants, associated with the liturgical group Jovens Cristãos (Christian Youth). Throughout the year, starting in January, the parish celebrates both secular and religious and festivals, these include: feast of Santa Bárbara (4 December), the festival of Nossa Senhora da Piedade (September), São Frutuoso (first Sunday following Easter), Santa Cruz (3 May or following Sunday), Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres (Sunday of Pascoela), São Lourenço (10 August) and São Vicente (22 January).

Production The film was the second Rolfe directed for the Fraser Film Release and Photographic Company. Rolfe had appeared in several of Darrell's plays as an actor. According to the Referee \\"the cast was chosen from some of the most popular Thespians in Australia. No expense was spared in producing both the comedy and drama on a scale comparing favorably With American offerings.\\" The film was shot on location at French's Forest in late 1914. A riot scene was shot at Manly Beach, involving a large number of extras carrying fire arms and weapons. According to star Charles Villiers: > All went well for a few moments, and then a military patrol swooped down and > held up the show. Expostulations were useless. We were evidently up to some > mischief, and the military men were determined to stop it. Perhaps they > thought we were, a party of Germans having our morning strafe. So we were > all duly lined up against a nearby fence while some soldiers set about > disarming us. A closer view of the weapons, however' satisfied the officer > in charge that we were harmless, and the 'riot' came off Without further > interruption. On 10 January 1915 it was announced the film was \\"just completed\\". Release The movie was released with two supporting films from Fraser, We'll Take her Children in amongst our own (1915, directed by Raymond Longford), and The Unknown (1915, directed by J. E. Mathews). Contemporary advertising for the film stated that: > A feature of the picture is the restraint exhibited by the author in dealing > with the most exciting series of incidents, the Australian characteristics > having been sustained throughout and the interest preserved without resource > to the lurid sensationalism which is the mark of many imported films.

He was made heir to the ancestral estates in Clanmaurice, by the death of his elder brothers and their heirs, he owed his knowledge of that event to the fidelity of his old nurse, Joan Harman, who together with her daughter, made her way from Dingle to Milan, where he was serving in the imperial army. On his return, he found his inheritance contested by a certain John fitz Richard, who however, surrendered it in 1552. He was confirmed in his estate by Mary, and on 20 December 1589 executed a deed settling it on his son Patrick and heirs male, remainder to his own right heirs. cites: Lodge, Peerage (Archdall), volume ii. He is said to have sat in the parliament of 1556, and in March 1567 he was knighted by Sir Henry Sidney. cites: Cal. Carew MSS. ii. 149.

His franchise was restored and the 1000 mark fine was remitted by the Court of Star Chamber on 10 July 1511; nonetheless, he left his career as a London merchant and entered the service of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who had aided him during his quarrel with the City authorities.

His land adjoined a large lake called Martin Mere, occupying an area of 3,132 acres, with a circumference of about eighteen miles which he resolved to drain. Having first obtained from the neighbouring landowners a lease of their rights in the mere for the duration of three lifetimes and 31 years, he obtained an act of parliament in 1692 and began work the following year. Up to 2,000 labourers were engaged at any one time. The result was successful for about 60 years, but in 1755, five years after the lease had expired, the sea broke in, almost destroying all that had been done. In 1781, draining operations were resumed by Thomas Eccleston of Scarisbrick but it was not until after the middle of the 19th century that Sir Peter Hesketh succeeded in converting the tract of fertile land to profitable use. Fleetwood died 22 April 1717, and was buried at St Cuthbert's Church, Churchtown, where there is a monument to his memory eulogising his enterprise and spirit.

Stanley's letters to Violet are intercepted by the villainous Pellew Owen. Violet's father, Major Howard, is blackmailed by Pellew Owen into giving him Violet's hand in marriage after Howard shoots a man in a quarrel over cards. Pellew tires of Violet and abandons her, so she goes with her father to Ballarat to find Stanley. Her father dies of exhaustion and Violet is kidnapped by Pellew after interrupting a bank robbery. She is recused by police and Pellew is arrested, but set free after he agrees to be a police spy. The Eureka rebellion takes place in which a miner is killed, Bentley acquitted, and the hotel burnt down. Miners take refuge in the Eureka Stockade and Pellew is killed. Stanley is wounded, but he manages to escape with Violet and they are united. Cast *Reynolds Denniston as Stanley Gifford *Maisie Carte as Violet Howard *Charles Villiers as Pellew Owen *Percy Walshe was Major Howard *Leslie Victor as Peter Lalor *Jena Williams as Mrs Gifford *Wynn Davies as soldier Production The screenplay, written by novelist Arthur Wright, won first prize of £30 in a competition held by Australasian Films. The movie was filmed on location near Sydney and in the Rushcutters Bay studio. The Bakery Hill scenes were shot at a railway deviation camp outside Sydney. The film used some of the original records stored in the Mitchell Library, including the proclamation concerning the imposition of a monthly tax on the miners, the licences which were issued, and the first Australian flag, consisting of a piece of blue hunting and five stars of the Southern Cross. Most of the cast came from the stage, including Reynolds Denniston, who was a well-known theatre star. Reception Arthur Wright says that director Alfired Rolfe \\"made a fine job of it, judged on the standard of the day, but though it was a good effort it did not pull big business. The title was against it for one thing.\\" It also screened under the title Eureka Stockade. =Critical= A critic from the Sydney Morning Herald said that \\"while free use is made of a love romance to point a moral and adorn a tale, the most realistic of the scenes are those showing the rising of the miners on the Ballarat goldfield of 1854 and the fierce fight behind the stockade.\\" The Referee called the film: > The first historical photo play produced in Sydney, and the result is very > creditable. Mr. Arthur Wright... has weaved in a story of love and > adventure, and has done the work very well. The play is full of life, and, > considering the large number of people who figure in the action > simultaneously, the 'staging' is excellent and the acting very > satisfactory... One of the most striking features of the film is the > faithful presentation of dress, goldfields, and life generally as they were > 60 years ago, in the era of the top hat, the crinoline, the Wellington boot, > and the Crimean shirt. Short story Arthur Wright later published a short story under the same title. However the contents of the story appear to be different from the plot of the book.

Reception An early screening of the film earned £1,100 for the Red Cross. According to one review: > Cupid Camouflaged has certainly succeeded in swelling the Red Cross funds ; > but it is a poor advertisement for the acting talent of the nobility of > Sydney. Cupid used to be a lively little cherub ; this camouflaged Cupid has > taken a sleeping draught, and can't stay awake. The slight plot is > effectively smothered under about a thousand feet of uninteresting fox- > trotting and ungraceful acrobatic dancing, under another thousand of garden > party, and an endless amount of tea-drinking. A writer from the Sydney Morning Herald said that \\"This little photoplay... was beautifully photographed, so brightly, and with naturally, acted that it afforded vivacious entertainment to everyone in the theatre.\\" Another review in The Sunday Times said: > In producing this film, Mr, Alfred Rolfe had much to cope with, but he has > made the best of a difficult job, and turned out a creditable piece of > celluloid amusement. Though Cupid Camouflaged is distinctly amateurish, and > there is an inclination to gaze into the camera's eyes, still, even > professionals are not always free from those weaknesses. Captain Saltmarsh > does his best with the role of the hero, and, when he lets himself go makes > quite a likeable character. In Miss Rosamunde Lumsdaine's acting there is > much to be thankful for. She has not cultivated Mary Pickford's curls, and > she behaves like an ordinary girl. Mrs, T. H. Kelly makes a dashing, well > gowned figure of the designing matron, and some of the best work of the > picture is done by Mr. James Osborne... The photography is good. Another film to aid the Red Cross, His Only Chance (1918), was made in Melbourne. Reviewing both films, Moving Picture World said that, \\"from a critical point of view, both subjects are woefully lacking in the essentials of an ordinarily good picture, and the fact they are advertised as \\"amateur\\" films does not balance these defects.

There are other paintings by the same artist with the same title, depicting the subjects either together in a double portrait or separately in a pair of portraits, for instance at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, the Courtauld Gallery in London, the Museum der bildenden Künste in Leipzig, and the Art Institute of Chicago. The two biblical ancestors are portrayed, in two different panels, on a dark background, standing on a barely visible ground. Both hold two small branches which cover their sexual organs. Eve holds the traditional apple, with the serpent coming to her from above from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Adam is shown scratching the right crown part of his scalp. History The work was part of the Tuscan Grand Dukes' collections since as early as 1688, and has been included in the Uffizi since the beginning of the 18th century. Filippo Baldinucci attributed it to Albrecht Dürer, until the inventory of 1784 assigned it to Cranach. The subject continues Dürer's anatomy studies, which had culminated in his large Adam and Eve panels now in the Museo del Prado. These were the first full-size nudes painted by a German artist. During his stay in Vienna, Cranach had frequented some groups of humanists who were close to Dürer, and from there he was inspired to do a first, smaller version of the theme of Adam and Eve in 1510, currently housed at the National Museum in Warsaw. In popular culture The pair of Adam and Eve paintings from the Kunsthistorisches Museum were featured in the German television series Dark, where they are displayed in the headquarters of the cult Erit Lux. Eve's image has been altered for the series to appear pregnant.

The population in 2011 was 563,Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 17.30 km². Geography The parish includes several settlements, not only including Abrunhosa-a-Velha, but also Vila Mendo de Tavares and Gouveia-Gare: a population of 880 inhabitants. It is served by rail services through its Abrunhosa-a-Velha and Gouveia railway stations. History Around from the main village is the hermitage of Nossa Senhora dos Verdes, which was founded around 1600, which is the basis for the modern parish. A pillory classified as property of public interest (Decree 23122, 11 October 1933), served the civil judge during the period, when that official occupied a local building (identifiable the building with a 15th-century Manueline window). Around 1608, a papal bull conceded indulgences to the Irmandade de Nossa Senhora dos Verdes de Abrunhosa-a-Velha (Brotherhood of Nossa Senhora dos Verdes). The chapel was still standing following a plague of grasshoppers that destroyed the municipality, part of Fornos de Algodres, across the Serra do Bom Sucesso and parish of Castelo (in Penalva do Castelo). Since this period, on the first Monday of Holy Spirit, a pilgrimage (both religious and devotional) occurs in the parish. When in the 18th century, Pais Amaral de Mangualde was made the donatarys of Abrunhosa-a-Velha, he also received for the small village, the category of vila (town). In addition to Vila Mendo de Tavares, this region was part of one municipality: Tavares, with its own civil judge and comarca administration. The captain-major and five ordinance officials guarded the outpost, while a superintendency for local tithes was invested in the juízo de fora of Mangualde and Tavares (in addition to two smaller municipalities at the time). By 1811, the donatary was already part of the royal possessions. Culture Annually, the parish is the center of festivals in honour of Saint Cecilia (village of Abrunhosa-a-Velha) and Saint Dominic (in Vila Mendo de Tavares).

Early life Bowring was born in Cranbourne, Berkshire, the son of Hong Kong businessman John Charles Bowring and grandson of Sir John Bowring. Humphrey Wykeham Bowring was his younger brother. He was educated at Clifton College. Bowring joined the Colonial Audit Branch in 1890 and served in the Far East until 1895 when he was appointed local auditor in the British Central Africa Protectorate.Robert M. Maxon, Thomas P. Ofcansky, Historical Dictionary of Kenya, Rowman & Littlefield, 9 September 2014, p.231 East Africa In 1899 he moved to East Africa to become auditor for the East Africa Protectorate and the Uganda Railway. He quickly rose to prominence, being made treasurer of the Protectorate in 1901, and was appointed to the newly instituted Legislative Council in 1907.Robert M. Maxon, Thomas P. Ofcansky, Historical Dictionary of Kenya, Rowman & Littlefield, 9 September 2014, p.231 He served Chief Secretary to the Government of the protectorate in 1911., remaining Chief Secretary if what was later transformed from a protectorate to be from 1920 the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya from 1911 until 1924, when he was appointed Governor of Nyasaland. During this period he was also a Grand Deacon of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons. In October 1912 Bowring was appointed to a commission on labour in Kenya. The report was published in 1913, and contained written and aural submissions from over two hundred Europeans and sixty Africans. Much of this evidence had been called a \\"concerted display of negrophobe malevolence\\". Between 1917 and 1919 Bowring was acting Governor of the East African Protectorate. He became acting governor of the EAP at a time when the colony was recovering from famine, there was a shortage of manpower and settlers were becoming increasingly assertive. Bowring was not always favourable to settlers, and he pushed measures that could benefit the African population and was less bigoted than many Kenyan settlers about the Indian immigrants. However, when face to face with settlers he often gave in to their demands. He was a supporter of the idea that two nominated Indians and one African should be added to the Legislative Council. In response to a financial crisis in the colony, he proposed to increase the hut and poll taxes. Despite resistance from the Colonial Office, he pushed the measure through, to take effect in the 1920–1921 fiscal year. Although supporting the idea of settling veterans of the First World War in the colony, he pointed out that there were shortages both of land and of labour, and said that settlers should have capital of more than £500. He was strongly in favour of extending the railway across the Uasin Gishu plateau for the benefit of the settlers in that area. Nyasaland Bowring was appointed Governor and Commander in Chief of the Nyasaland Protectorate in 1923. and held office until 30 May 1929. In October 1925, Bowring laid the foundation stone of the new buildings at Livingstonia, which Dr Robert Laws wanted to develop into a university for African students in Nyasaland and neighbouring colonies. He wrote \\"Livingstonia appeals to me enormously as a training centre because of its comparative isolation and at the same time easy accessibility. The students are away from the many temptations of town life, and within easy reach by the lake and in touch by telegraph\\". Bowring believed that the future of the Nyasaland protectorate would be based on developing agriculture. A few European planters would be involved in this project, but mostly the land was to be developed by Africans instructed by Europeans. He was against setting aside large amounts of land for European use. About the shortage of land for Africans in the Shire Highlands he said \\"the only method of dealing with the problem is to re- acquire from the landowners in convenient blocks of sufficient area to accommodate the natives at present resident on the estates for whom accommodation acceptable to them and to Government cannot be provided elsewhere on Crown Land\\". He proposed to pay for the scheme through a graduated land tax, hitting the largest estates hardest. There were delays and disputes over the proposed reforms. In the second half of 1926 Bowring returned to England on leave and met officials at the Colonial Office in person, but was not able to gain their agreement to his proposal for settling the land problem. In 1927 he submitted a revised bill to the Legislative Council, and finally in 1928 the \\"Native Tenants on Private Estates Bill\\" was passed. Africans resident on estates were liable to pay rent in cash or kind equivalent to about 2–3 months' pay, and in return would get a plot of land large enough to grow crops for their family and materials for a hut. The owner could not claim rent if he refused to offer work. Official policy in Nyasaland was to consolidate villages to facilitate administration and control. By the late 1920s the practice had largely been abandoned. Bowring tried to revive it, trying to gain support from chiefs and district officers, but it lapsed again after he had left office. On the question of the future of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Bowring was in favour of a three-way partition. Part would go to South Africa and part to Southern Rhodesia, while the northeast would be combined with Nyasaland in joining an East African federation. Bowring was an enthusiastic advocate of conscripting forced labour to work on European tobacco farms or on public works at minimal wages. He sought Colonial Office approval to extend its use to unpaid work on road building projects, often taking workers far from their homes.McCracken (2012), p. 221 This was similar to the proposed use of forced labour in Kenya where the governor Sir Edward Northey had caused a scandal with his 1919 instruction to government officials to coerce African labour to work on European-owned farms and estates, despite earlier Colonial Office objections.Okia (2008), pp. 263–4 The Colonial Secretary, Leo Amery, who wanted to avoid a repeat of the Northey scandal, vetoed the proposal and, in 1928, instructed Bowring to consider the introduction of a form of Indirect rule in Nyasaland, appointing chiefs as Native Authorities. Bowring resisted on the basis that he thought Nyasaland's tribal organisation was disintegrating and his tour of duty was cut short in May 1929.McCracken (2012), pp. 221–2 Personal life In 1909, he married Ethel Dorothy Watts , daughter of G. K. Watts; they had four sons and three daughters. References Sources   J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966, Woodbridge, James Currey pp. 130–2. *O. Okia, (2008).

His father, Edzard the Great, had introduced primogeniture in the county of East Frisia, so that his older brother Enno II of East Frisia inherited the county alone and he had to hold back. Despite his ambitions, he always acknowledged his brother's rights and did not dispute the inheritance. Unlike his father and his brother, Johan remained a Catholic. After his father's death, he joined the imperial army. However, he soon returned to East Frisia and began supporting his brother. He had, however, little positive impact on his brother, who ruled unwisely. Johan was unable to distinguish himself, and also took some unwise and ill-advised actions, such as those that lead to the Guelders feud. He may also have encouraged Enno to try to re-introduce Catholicism in East Frisia. This attempt was cut short when Enno died in 1540. Enno's widow, Anna became regent for her son Edzard II. Johan had an endless series of conflicts with Anna. In 1538, Johan married Dorothea of Austria, the illegitimate daughter of Emperor Maximilian I. In 1543, Emperor Charles V reminded Johan of the fact that he was still, technically, in the imperial service. Charles appointed Johan as stadtholder of the Duchy of Limburg, Falkenburg and Dalheim. From that time onwards, Johan was colloquially called Count Johan of Falkenburg. His descendants lived at Coldeborg Castle in the Rheiderland and were financially supported by the counts of East Frisia.

Harrison's paintings are featured in personal and corporate art collections across the United States, and he had successful one-man shows at the Hammer Galleries in New York City and the Conacher Gallery in San Francisco.Dickey, Gary. A Jim Harrison: His World Remembered. American Masters Foundation , 1982, pages 31-32. Biography Jim Harrison was born in his grandmother's house in Leslie, Georgia, on January 12, 1936. When he was six years old, his father took a job with American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and his mother worked as a Southern Bell switchboard operator in Denmark, South Carolina. At Denmark High School Harrison worked on the annual staff, school newspaper, and class bulletin boards. During summer vacations, Harrison took a job as an assistant to a seventy-year-old sign painter, J. J. Cornforth. The elderly gentleman taught him how to letter, and for several summers the two traveled the rural areas around Denmark painting Coca-Cola bulletins on the sides of barns and country stores. Harrison marks this time as what sparked his interest in art. His mother also pushed him to pursue his interests in art. After high school graduation Harrison entered the University of South Carolina where he pursued a dual major in art and physical education. In 1960 he began an eleven-year high school coaching career which included working for the national league baseball Cleveland Indians as a part-time talent scout from 1965 through 1970. At three schools he coached football, girls' basketball, and baseball, and he never experienced a losing season as a head coach. In 1970 he declined an offer to join the Furman University football coaching staff and returned to his hometown of Denmark, South Carolina to pursue a career as an artist.Dickey, Gary. A Jim Harrison: His World Remembered. American Masters Foundation , 1982, pages 1-21. In 1972, Harrison had no knowledge of the art market, but went to New York City for the fall Greenwich Village sidewalk art show. His only sale during the three-week show was an $85 original, and it cost him $800 in expenses. After several years he had 10 galleries selling his originals. He published his first limited edition print, \\"Coastal Dunes\\" in 1973 through Frame House Gallery of Louisville, Kentucky. In 1975, Frame House released their first Jim Harrison print, \\"Rural Americana\\" through the publisher's network of 600 dealers. Many of his prints have appreciated up to 3,000 percent of their original value.Dickey, Gary. A Jim Harrison: His World Remembered. American Masters Foundation , 1982, pages 22-32. Harrison's paintings are featured in personal and corporate art collections across the country including The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta, Georgia; The Maytag Corporation in Newton, Iowa; Philip Morris Company in New York, New York; The Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, Illinois; and the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. He was a licensee of The Coca-Cola Company for more than 10 years and produces The Coca-Cola Calendar for collectors each year. He first painted the company's trademark on the side of an old barn as the 14-year-old apprentice of the elderly sign painter, J. J. Cornforth. Currently, Harrison's artwork can be found in his studio located in Denmark, South Carolina, where he first realized his love for the arts. His later paintings depict the rural life of the 20th-century Americans including images of churches, bridges, and buildings.Martin, Deidre. \\"50 Years with Coca-Cola.

Zvezda moonbase was canceled with the rest of the Soviet human lunar programs. Implementation The base's main habitation module would first be delivered to the Moon. Later automatic spacecraft, including the Lunokhod rover, would be delivered, followed by a human crew and more modules. For the safety of the crew, the habitation modules might have been covered with regolith. In order to allow for exploration or repositioning of the base, the habitation modules may have been installed on wheel chassis, and multiple docked to form a movable train. Energy for the base would have been provided by atomic batteries and a nuclear reactor.3D representation of the proposed base The moonbase project was ordered by the Soviet space chief Korolyov to Barmin's Spetcmash bureau. The project was named DLB Lunar Base in technical specifications and Zvezda in government documents. Unofficially, the project was called Barmingrad (Barmin's city) by its designers. Several aspects of lunar colonization were studied: * the aims of the base; * a concept for construction; * stages of realization; *construction and scientific equipment; * possible military supplies. Parameters The main unit of the base was the habitation module. The plan was for the base to consist of 9 such modules, each delivered separately. The modules had control, laboratory, life, medical, dining, store and other specific aims. Each module was to be 8.6 meters in full length and 3.3 meters in diameter, with 18 tons in full weight. The modules were to be 4.5 meters in initial length, and grow to full size by an expanded mechanism and air compression after delivery. The train had an 8-ton mass and would be operated by 4 cosmonauts and consist of tug, life, energy and drilling modules. Chassis of each module had 8 wheels with separate drive, each as implemented on Lunokhods. Modules of the base and train had 3 layers of protection from micrometeorites, heat and ultraviolet rays. Between the external and internal metal layers was a special styrofoam. The train had a manipulator arm which would have enabled the collection of samples of soil without the use of space suits. Water would have been extracted from the lunar soil by a chemical reaction. The Lavochkin bureau developed but did not test a small version of such a unit. The base would have had a crew of 9 to 12. Realization The Zvezda project was not a separate program but part of the N1-L3 expedition program for the 1970s. The first cosmonaut landings were to be done with the LK Moon landing module of L3 spacecraft. The realization of the project depended on key parts of the N1-L3 program - the N-1 superheavy launcher, all 4 launches of which failed between 1969 and 1972. Before the cancellation of the Soviet human Moon program, the new project N1F-L3M was proposed for expeditions from 1979 onwards. These would have had a longer duration than the Apollo flights and may have led to the successor creation of the Zvezda moonbase in 1980s. Also, the new LEK Lunar Expeditionary Complex for transportation to Moon and moonbase was proposed then. The new Soviet space chief Glushko canceled the N1-L3 program in 1974 but proposed the new Vulkan-LEK project for expeditions to the Moon, based on a new superheavy launcher developed by his bureau, but this project was not realized either. Moon expeditions and the construction of a Moon base would have required nearly 50 billion rubles (80 billion US dollars in 1997). All crewed Soviet lunar programs, including a Zvezda moonbase, had been classified as top secret and were only published in the glasnost epoch since 1990. Before this time, the Soviet Union officially denied the existence of these programs but confirmed the existence of near-Earth crewed orbital stations and Moon exploration by robotic spacecraft. In media * The 1969-1970 TV series UFO features a Sovatek Corporation (a play on \\"Soviet\\" and \\"tech\\") moonbase similar to Zvezda and equipped with enormous truck-like rovers. * The 2019 web television series For All Mankind has a Soviet moonbase called Zvezda.

The hourly service initially runs to the south east from Krefeld via Neuss to Cologne and then turns to run to the northeast via Solingen, Wuppertal, Hagen to Münster. Every two hours it continues to Rheine. History  Today's RE 7 is the successor to the former StädteExpress line SE from Aachen via Cologne and Wuppertal to Munster. From 1998, under the original version of North Rhine-Westphalia’s integrated timetable (ITF 1), the service ran between Düren and Munster. With the introduction of ITF 2 in December 2002, the line was extended at both ends to Aachen and to Rheine. Since the Rhein-Sieg-Express (RE 9) often ran late under the new timetable, in June 2003, the RE 7 exchanged its section on the left (west) bank of the Rhine with the RE 9's left bank route and has since then run to Krefeld. This eliminates a level crossing of rail tracks in Cologne and avoids conflicts between the two services. The short turn around times available for the RE 7 in Krefeld then led to significant delays on the RE 7. To stabilise the timetable, in 2006 locomotives on the line were changed from class 111 to class 112 and the Rhein-Münsterland-Express since then has runs every two hours to Münster. These changes eventually led to normal on-time running. The Zweckverband SPNV Münsterland (Münsterland rail transport association) is planning, however, to extend hourly services to Rheine. As part of the second stage of modernisation at Rheine station, one of the two disused platforms are to be reactivated, which would make available six platform tracks instead of four. The train could therefore operate without platform conflicts with InterCity services on the Emsland line. In return, Regionalbahn RB 68 services would be discontinued. The line is operated every hour. Long sections of RE 7 runs parallel to Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn lines and it has some of the character of a fast S-Bahn service and is perceived by the passengers accordingly. It was operated by DB Regio NRW until 2015. Since December 2015, it has been operated by National Express.National Express celebrates German rail success National Express 7 February 2013National Express plans German invasion The Daily Telegraph 7 February 2013 Route  The Rhein-Münsterland-Express runs on the following railway lines: #Rheine–Münster line (full length) #Münster–Hamm line (full length) #Hamm–Hagen line (full length) #Dortmund–Wuppertal line (from Hagen Hauptbahnhof) #Wuppertal-Düsseldorf line (to Linden/Gruiten junction) #Gruiten–Köln-Deutz line (to Köln-Mülheim) #Duisburg– Köln-Deutz line (from Cologne-Mülheim) #Hohenzollern Bridge #Cologne–Krefeld line (entire length) Rail operations  Since December 2015, the service has been operated by National Express with Bombardier Talent 2s.National Express Talent 2 EMU rolled out Railway Gazette International 28 November 2014National Express launches first Bombardier Talent 2 train Railway Technology 3 December 2014 It was previously operated by DB Regio NRW with push–pull trains, each composed of four double-deck carriages hauled by class 112 locomotives.

The film, directed by Harold Medford, was released by 20th Century Fox, and was narrated by Rock Hudson. Background Marilyn Monroe rose to fame with the 1953 film noir Niagara, released by 20th Century Fox. Monroe had signed with Fox originally in 1947, and played bit parts in a few films, starring actors like Betty Grable, June Haver, Cary Grant, Peggy Cummins, and Jeanne Crain. When released from Fox, Monroe found work as yet again a bit player in films like Love Happy (1949), starring The Marx Brothers. She re-signed with Fox in 1950 and began playing small but meaningful roles in big-budgeted films like All About Eve, starring Bette Davis. After several films, Fox gave Marilyn her biggest break with Niagara. The film starred Monroe, Joseph Cotten, and Jean Peters. Monroe went on to make millions for Fox, starring in movies like Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), and River of No Return (1954). Monroe's first flop in two years was There's No Business Like Show Business, a musical co-starring Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Donald O'Connor, Mitzi Gaynor, and Johnnie Ray. This film's lavish production didn't overshadow the dragged plot line. However, Monroe re-gained her success with The Seven Year Itch in 1955, co-starring Tom Ewell and Evelyn Keyes. Seven Year Itch showcased the famous scene of Monroe's white dress being skyrocketed in the air by a subway grating. This film was a major success, as was Marilyn's next feature, Bus Stop (1956), which was her last film with Fox until 1960. However, Monroe's biggest success in a film was in 1959's Some Like It Hot, a comedy co-starring Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. However, Marilyn only focuses on the films that Monroe made with 20th Century Fox, which excludes Some Like It Hot, as it was released by United Artists. Monroe's last film with Fox was the 1960 romantic- musical comedy Let's Make Love, also starring Yves Montand. In 1962, she signed on with Fox to remake a 1940 film called My Favorite Wife. The film was re-titled Something's Got to Give and cast Monroe in the lead alongside Dean Martin, Cyd Charisse, Wally Cox, and Phil Silvers. Monroe died before the film's completion. In 1963, Fox recast Something's Got to Give, with Doris Day, James Garner, and Polly Bergen, and re-titled the film to Move Over, Darling. Releases To date, Marilyn has not been released on either DVD or VHS.

IFChina was founded in 2008 by Chinese independent filmmaker, artist, and writer Jian Yi, Douglas Xiao and Eva Song. Jian Yi co-founded the China Village Documentary Project with filmmaker Wu Wenguang in 2004, which was the impetus for the development of IFChina. IFChina is located in Ji'an of Jiangxi province, China. The inland province has the distinction of being at the crossroads of the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta and provides large numbers of migrant workers to the three prosperous coastal provinces it borders. The small city of Ji’an is within the Jinggangshan region, the “cradle of the Chinese revolution” and birthplace of the Chinese Red Army (the People's Liberation Army of China). This location is representative of an urban community within a vast rural area, providing a template for other cultural organizations to follow. Real Time magazine reported that “[IFChina] is said to be China’s first non-profit art and cultural organization that collects and documents the stories of ordinary Chinese.”Edwards, Dan, “You can’t build on emptiness.” Real Time Arts, June/July 2011, 103, p. 16. http://www.realtimearts.net/article/103/10321, August 21, 2011 In June 2009, the organization sought to be under the umbrella of the state-owned Jinggangshan University and established its Participatory Documentary Center on JGSU campus. dGenerate Films reports that “The IFCHINA team reach out to people from every walk of life from unemployed workers, school children, college students, migrant workers, to rural women, children, and elderly”.Cai, Isabella Tianzi, “Jian Yi launches IFChina website highlighting work in rural China.” dGenerate Films, December 28, 2010. http://dgeneratefilms.com/china- today/jian-yi-launches-ifchina-website-highlighting-work-in-rural-china/, August 21, 2011 Currently, much of its work focuses on self-governance of China’s rural communities and the social and demographic changes occurring due to urban migration, specifically for children and elderly who have been described as “left behind”. Emphasis is placed on offering perspectives of the villagers themselves and their daily lives through independent documentary film and theater with the aim to preserve individual and communal memories. The organization’s undertakings include oral history interviews; participatory documentary workshops; school photography workshops; a documentary theater project; exploration of Red History and Culture (state efforts to generate public support for its political ideology and legitimacy); a rice collection project (“A Scoop of Rice”) which utilizes volunteers to deliver rice or noodles to senior citizens as a “compensation” to their “taking” of people’s stories; a “Happy Rooms” mural painting project; university courses offered in partnership with Jinggangshan University; a Rural Design Workshop; and a planned “Museum of Memories” (MoM) to collect and preserve the organization’s projects.

MicroRNAs are typically transcribed as ~70 nucleotide precursors and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22 nucleotide product. The excised region or, mature product, of the miR-134 precursor is the microRNA mir-134. miR-134 was one of a number of microRNAs found to be increasingly expressed in schizophrenia. Functions miR-134 is a brain- specific microRNA; in rats it is localised specifically in hippocampal neurons and may indirectly regulate synaptic development through antisense pairing with LIMK1 mRNA. In the human brain, SIRT1 is thought to mediate CREB protein through miR-134, giving the microRNA a role in higher brain functions such a memory formation. miR-134 has also been reported to function in mouse embryonic stem cells as part of a complex network regulating their differentiation.

The threesome took much of their inspiration from the Incredible String Band's eclectic strain of psychedelic folk, although songwriter and singer Tony Doré's compositions had a sound and voice of their own. The All Music Guide writes of the trio, \\"Tony, Caro and John were also wont to embellish their basic male-female vocal harmonies, and one electric guitar-one-acoustic-guitar-bass line-up, with weird touches of hippie psychedelia in the occasional electronic effects, tinkling percussion, flageolet (a type of small flute), wah-wah, and violin... Slightly sardonic but cheerfully playful, and with strong tunes effectively blending major and minor modes, they're more approachable for listeners with conventional rock and pop tastes than the Incredible String Band, or Incredible String Band-like bands of the period, such as Forest and Dr. Strangely Strange.\\" Band history Multi-instrumentalist Tony Doré and bassist John Clark were childhood friends in Derby, England, and played together on both the rock and folk circuit. After university they reunited in 1970, when John came to London to join Tony and Caroline (Caro), who had played university folk clubs together. All on the First Day was made in 1972 with almost no budget and primitive equipment, recorded on John's 2-track; they could overdub in mono only by re-recording the backing track at the same time. They self-pressed the LP in an edition of only 100 copies, with the home-grown nature of the product emphasized by individually spray-painted covers. Expanding the band line-up with Simon Burrett on lead guitar, Jonny Owen on Harmonica and Rod Jones on keyboards, Tony, Caro and John continued on the college circuit for a little while under the name \\"Forever and Ever\\" but the gigging stopped in the late seventies, when families and careers took precedence. The band continued to jam together, and to record in Clark's by now, multi-track studio. Then in 2001, Tony Doré was contacted by Shadoks Music in Germany, when it transpired that there was an underground following for the All on the First Day album, and copies were changing hands for substantial sums of money. The band agreed that Shadoks could produce a limited release of vinyl albums from the original master, and at the same time release the album on CD. The release included five bonus tracks recorded around the time of All on the First Day. Almost simultaneously the band released some of the studio tracks recorded since All on the First Day, as the limited edition CD-R album Retrospect under the Forever and Ever band name. This was available online. Bassist John Clark died in 2005. Following the wider release of the band's material, one of Doré’s compositions \\"The Snowdon Song\\" was covered by the indie duo Beach House, on their eponymous 2006 debut album. Although not attributed to TCJ on the album, and given a different title (\\"Lovelier Girl\\"), Beach House do not dispute authorship of the song. Doré worked with Beach House’s management on authorship and royalty issues. Recent events Doré continues to write songs, and between 2006 and 2010 recorded 13 new tracks which were finalized in 2010 in Rod Jones’ studio in France. This collection, Fall Away Like Leaves by Tony Doré and Friends, was released digitally in 2011 by Gaarden Records of Portland, Oregon. Gaarden have also reissued All on the First Day as digital downloads and as limited editions on green and maroon vinyl. In 2012, Tony, Caro and John had their first major label release with the album Blue Clouds on the Chicago-based record label, Drag City. This album, a joint release with Gaarden and Galactic Zoo, was made up of rare unreleased and live tracks from the All On The First Day era. In November 2017 All On The First Day was again re-released, in vinyl and CD format, this time by the German label Tapete. Tony and Caro announced that they were going to tour again in early 2018 in Germany and the UK to promote the re-release – the full scale band tour since the 1970s. They will be joined by Jonny Owen (Caro’s brother) of Walking Wounded, on harmonica and vocals, and Simon Burrett of the Blue Bishops on lead guitar. In late 2017, Tony and Simon have completed recording a new collection of songs, The Festival At The End Of The World under the band name Nation of Strangers, for early 2018 release.

What type of thing is project management?  Project management can be described as all of the following: * Management - in business and human organization activity is simply the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group of one or more people or entities) or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. ** Management process - is a process of planning and controlling the performance or execution of any type of activity. * Process - ongoing collection of activities, with inputs, outputs and the energy required to transform inputs to outputs. * Project - A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.Project Management Institute (2004).

Branches of project management  * Effort management - is a project management subdiscipline for effective and efficient use of time and resources to perform activities regarding quantity, quality and direction. * Project portfolio management * Program management * Project risk management * Project workforce management  Project management by domain  *Construction project management concepts ** Construction - in the fields of architecture and civil engineering, is a process that consists of the building or assembling of infrastructure. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of multitasking. Normally the job is managed by the project manager and supervised by the construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect. *** Construction management ** Architectural engineering ** Virtual design and construction - (VDC) is the use of integrated multi-disciplinary performance models of design-construction projects, including the Product (i.e., facilities), Work Processes and Organization of the design - construction - operation team in order to support explicit and public business objectives. *Software project management concepts ** Software engineering - is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.“IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology,” IEEE std 610.12-1990, 1990, quoted at the beginning of Chapter 1: Introduction to the guide ** Software development *** Agile software development - is a set of principles about how software should be developed based on a rapidly iterative agile way of working in contrast to many previous software development methodologies.Peter Schuh (2005). Integrating Agile Development in the Real World. ebrary, Inc. p.2. ** Capability Maturity Model - (CMM) in software engineering is a model of the maturity of the capability of certain business processes. A maturity model can be described as a structured collection of elements that describe certain aspects of maturity in an organization, and aids in the definition and understanding of an organization's processes. ** Dynamic Systems Development Method - (DSDM) is a software development methodology originally based upon the Rapid Application Development methodology. DSDM is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes continuous user involvement. ** Unified Process - The Unified process is a popular iterative and incremental software development process framework. The best-known and extensively documented refinement of the Unified Process is the Rational Unified Process (RUP).

Typical phases include: # Initiation # Planning and design # Execution and construction # Monitoring and controlling systems # Completion  General project management concepts  * Dependency in a project network is a link amongst a project's terminal elements. * Duration of a project's terminal element is the number of calendar periods it takes from the time the execution of element starts to the moment it is completed. * Float in a project network is the amount of time that a task in a project network can be delayed without causing a delay to subsequent tasks and or the project completion date. * Hammock activity - is a schedule (project management) or project planning term for a grouping of subtasks that \\"hangs\\" between two end dates it is tied to. (Or the two end-events it is fixed to.) * Product breakdown structure - (PBS) in project management is an exhaustive, hierarchical tree structure of components that make up an item, arranged in whole-part relationship. * Product description - in project management is a structured format of presenting information about a project product * Project Management Triangle - is a model of the constraints of project management. * Resources in project management terminology are required to carry out the project tasks. They can be people, equipment, facilities, funding, or anything else capable of definition (usually other than labour) required for the completion of a project activity. * Scope of a project in project management is the sum total of all of its products and their requirements or features. * Tasks in project management are activity that needs to be accomplished within a defined period of time. * Time limit is a narrow field of time, or a particular point in time, by which an objective or task must be accomplished. * Work in project management is the amount of effort applied to produce a deliverable or to accomplish a task (a terminal element). * Vertical slice - is a type of milestone, benchmark, or deadline, with emphasis on demonstrating progress across all components of a project. * Work package - is a subset of a project that can be assigned to a specific party for execution. Because of the similarity, work packages are often misidentified as projects. * Workstream - is a set of associated activities, focused around a particular scope that follow a path from initiation to completion.  Project management procedures  * Aggregate planning - is an operational activity which does an aggregate plan for the production process, in advance of 2 to 18 months, to give an idea to management as to what quantity of materials and other resources are to be procured and when, so that the total cost of operations of the organization is kept to the minimum over that period. * Allocation - is the assignment of available resources in an economic way. * Budgeting ** Budget - generally refers to a list of all planned expenses and revenues. ** Budgeted cost of work performed - (BCWP) measures the budgeted cost of work that has actually been performed, rather than the cost of work scheduled. ** Budgeted cost of work scheduled - (BCWS) the approved budget that has been allocated to complete a scheduled task (or Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) component) during a specific time period. * Constructability - is a project management technique to review the construction processes from start to finish during pre- construction phase. It will identify obstacles before a project is actually built to reduce or prevent error, delays, and cost overrun. * Cost engineering - is the area of engineering practice where engineering judgment and experience are used in the application of scientific principles and techniques to problems of cost estimating, cost control, business planning and management science, profitability analysis, project management, and planning and scheduling.\\"AACE International's Recommended Practice 11R-88, Required Skills and Knowledge of Cost Engineering, provides some answers which are excerpted here. Beyond being a guiding document for AACE International’s education and certification developments, 11R-88 is an excellent reference for industry core competency and career model development. * Critical path method - (CPM) is a mathematically based modeling technique for scheduling a set of project activities, used in project management. * Earned value management - (EVM) is a project management technique for measuring project progress in an objective manner, with a combination of measuring scope, schedule, and cost in a single integrated system. ** Earned schedule - (ES) is an extension to earned value management (EVM), which renames two traditional measures, to indicate clearly they are in units of currency or quantity, not time. * Estimation in project management is the processes of making accurate estimates using the appropriate techniques. * Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) - is a network analysis technique that allows probabilistic treatment of both network logic and activity duration estimated. * HERMES is a Project Management Method developed by the Swiss Government, based on the German V-Modell. The first domain of application was software projects. * Kickoff meeting - is the first meeting with the project team and the client of the project. * Linear scheduling method - (LSM) is a graphical scheduling method focusing on continuous resource utilization in repetitive activities. It is believed that it originally adopted the idea of Line-Of-Balance method. * Program Management - is the process of managing multiple ongoing inter-dependent projects. An example would be that of designing, manufacturing and providing support infrastructure for an automobile manufacturer. * Project accounting - Is the practice of creating financial reports specifically designed to track the financial progress of projects, which can then be used by managers to aid project management. *Project Cost Management A method of managing a project in real-time from the estimating stage to project control; through the use of technology cost, schedule and productivity is monitored. * Project planning - is part of project management, which relates to the use of schedules such as Gantt charts to plan and subsequently report progress within the project environment. * Task is part of a set of actions which accomplish a job, problem or assignment.  Project management tools  * BOSCARD - a strategic planning tool used in project management to give the Terms of reference for new projects. * Event chain diagram - diagram that show the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other. * Gantt chart - is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. It illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements comprise the work breakdown structure of the project. * Integrated Master Plan - (IMP) is an event-based, top level plan, consisting of a hierarchy of Program Events. * Milestones are tools used in project management to mark specific points along a project timeline. * Project charter is a statement of the scope, objectives, and participants in a project. * Project Management Simulators - are computer- based tools used in project management training programs. Usually, project management simulation is a group exercise. The computer-based simulation is an interactive learning activity. * Project management software - is a type of software, including scheduling, cost control and budget management, resource allocation, collaboration software, communication, quality management and documentation or administration systems, which are used to deal with the complexity of large projects. * Project network - is a graph (flow chart) depicting the sequence in which a project's terminal elements are to be completed by showing terminal elements and their dependencies. *Project plan - is a formal, approved document used to guide both project execution and project control. The primary uses of the project plan are to document planning assumptions and decisions, facilitate communication among stakeholders, and document approved scope, cost, and schedule baselines. A project plan may be summary or detailed.Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), 2000 Edition * Risk register - is a tool commonly used in project planning and organizational risk assessments. * Schedules in project management consists of a list of a project's terminal elements with intended start and finish dates. * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a tool that defines a project and groups the project's discrete work elements in a way that helps organize and define the total work scope of the project. A Work breakdown structure element may be a product, data, a service, or any combination. WBS also provides the necessary framework for detailed cost estimating and control along with providing guidance for schedule development and control.  Project-related problems  * Cost overrun - is defined as excess of actual cost over budget. * Scope creep - refers to changes in a project's scope at any point after the project commenses. This phenomenon can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled. It is generally considered a negative occurrence that is to be avoided. The Systems Development Life Cycle.  Project management standards  * ISO 10006 - guideline for quality management in projects, is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization. * PMBoK; Project Management Body of Knowledge, is the international standard for project management developed by the Project Management Institute PMI. * APMBoK; Association for Project Management Body of Knowledge, developed by the APM (affiliated with the IPMA).  Project participants  * Executive sponsor - : the senior member of the project board and often the chair. * Project Management Professional - is a certificated professional in project management. * Certified Project Management Professional * Project manager - : professional in the field of project management. Project managers can have the responsibility of the planning, execution, and closing of any project, typically relating to construction industry, architecture, computer networking, telecommunications or software development. * Project stakeholders - are those entities within or without an organization which sponsor a project or, have an interest or a gain upon a successful completion of a project. * Project team - is the management team leading the project, and provide services to the project. Projects often bring together a variety number of problems. Stakeholders have important issues with others. * Project management office -: The Project management office in a business or professional enterprise is the department or group that defines and maintains the standards of process, generally related to project management, within the organization. The PMO strives to standardize and introduce economies of repetition in the execution of projects.

The first composition dolls were made in the 19th century. Composite dolls were marketed as unbreakable, compared to earlier more fragile dolls.Izen, Judith. Collector's Guide to Ideal Dolls: Identification and Value Guide , 3rd Edition. Collector's Books, 2005. However, over time the composite material deteriorated, leaving many older dolls with small cracks and flaked surfaces. Some dolls were given a protective coating of varnish to delay deterioration. Background Many antique German and French bisque dolls from the 19th century combine a bisque head with a ball-jointed body made of composition.An Introduction to Bisque Dolls - About.com In 1877 French dollmaker Jumeau introduced the Bébé Incassable, with a bisque head portraying a young girl and a fully articulated composition body. With realistic glass eyes and contemporary fashion styles, thousands of Bébé dolls were produced for an international market. The French Bleuette doll from S.F.B.J. has a jointed composition body with a bisque or composition head. The composition Bleuette was produced from 1905 to 1958. In the United States composition dolls were hailed as an improvement in doll making from the fragile bisque and china material previously used. Two types of composition manufacturing processes were used: cold press and hot press. The cold-press composition manufacturing process was invented by Solomon D. Hoffmann in the 1890s. Hot-press composition began around 1920 and was an improvement in the processing. Horsman secured the rights from Hoffmann, whose company was the American Doll Company. Some early celebrity dolls were made of composition, like the Baby Peggy doll from Louis Amberg & Sons, which was a success in 1923. The American Ideal Toy Company began making composition dolls in 1907. They produced over 200 variations of dolls throughout the composition era. Their Shirley Temple doll was one of the most successful celebrity dolls. First produced in 1934, millions of the composition Shirley dolls were produced. Composition doll manufacturing lasted until the late 1940s in the U.S., when plastic began to be used for dolls.

In many cultures, it is most commonly, but not universally, used to indicate disagreement, denial, or rejection. It can also signify disapproval or upset at a situation, often with slower movement. Head shaking while trying food, in Western cultures, can also communicate one is enjoying the food or a strong approval of it. To indicate rejection Different cultures assign different meanings to the gesture. Shaking to indicate \\"no\\" is widespread, and appears in a large number of diverse cultural and linguistic groups. Areas in which head shaking generally takes this meaning include the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe, South America, North America and Australia. To indicate approval However, in some Southeastern European areas such as Bulgaria and southern Albania, it is used for the opposite purpose, to indicate affirmation, meaning \\"yes\\". In those regions, nodding in fact means \\"no\\" as well, the complete reverse of most other places in the world. Origin There are varying theories as to why head shake is so frequently used to mean \\"no\\". One simple theory is that it is most common form of expressing negative reaction, indicating that one disagrees with the other person. It has also been statedDarwin, Charles. The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1913; Page 272, accessed through Google Book Search. that babies, when hungry, search for their mother's milk by moving their heads vertically, but decline milk by turning their head from side to side. An early survey of head shake and other gestures was The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, written by Charles Darwin in 1872. Darwin wrote to missionaries in many parts of the world asking for information on local gestures, and concluded that shaking head for \\"no\\" was common to many different groups. The gesture is possibly ancient in origin. In the biblical book of Job, there is a reference to it: > 4 I also could talk as you do, were you in my place. I could declaim over > you, or wag my head at you; > 5 I could strengthen you with talk, or shake my head with silent lips. > :—Job 16:4–5Text from the New American bible, > https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PF1.HTM Types This gesture can be classified into two types based on the speed of delivery:Kuhnke, Elizabeth.

His death in France after making arrangements for the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots was regarded as suspicious by contemporaries. Life He was the eldest son of Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming, Lord High Chamberlain, and Johanna or Jonet Stewart, natural daughter of James IV. Malcolm Fleming, who had been taken prisoner at the battle of Solway Moss in 1542, and had been tried and acquitted of treason in 1545 for his connection with the English party, was slain at the battle of Pinkie 10 September 1547. In August 1548, the young new Lord Fleming, along with Lord Erskine, accompanied Queen Mary to France, and his mother was appointed her governess. James Fleming was an English prisoner by May 1549, and was released by exchange with the English prisoner James Wilford.Calendar State Papers Scotland, (1898), p.175 In 1550 James accompanied the queen dowager Mary of Guise into France .Keith, History, vol.1, 135 On 21 December 1553, James was confirmed as Great Chamberlain of Scotland for life.Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, 1546–80, no.877 About the same time, he was appointed guardian of the East and Middle Marches, and invested with power of justiciary within his jurisdictions. James Fleming was one of the eight commissioners elected by parliament 8 December 1557, to represent the Scottish nation at the nuptials of Queen Mary with Francis, dauphin of France, on 24 April 1558. Though the commissioners agreed to swear fealty to the King-Dauphin as the husband of the queen, they affirmed that their instructions did not permit them to agree that he should receive the Scottish ensigns of royalty. They were thereupon requested to support this proposal in the Scottish parliament, but when they left for Scotland, the French court appears to have been doubtful of the intentions of certain members of the commission. In such circumstances, the death of James and three of the other commissioners on the way home awakened grave suspicions that they had been designedly poisoned. The Earls of Rothes and Cassilis and Bishop Reid of Orkney succumbed sooner to the attack than Fleming, who, in the hope of recovery, returned to Paris, but died there on 18 December. Family By his marriage to Lady Barbara Hamilton, eldest daughter of James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault, Fleming had one daughter, Jean Fleming. She was married firstly to John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane, who died 3 October 1595, by whom she had a son and a daughter; and secondly to John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis, by whom she had no issue.

The series is set in the Austrian Alps and centers around a fictional Bergwacht (mountain rescue) team in Ramsau am Dachstein. Each episode focuses on a rescue mission, explores the background stories of the people involved the incident (more often than not caused by their risky behaviour) and the private lives of the team members.  Setting  Andreas Marthaler is about to open a climbing school in the USA together with his girlfriend. Before emigrating he attends the wedding of his best friend and leader of the mountain rescue Stefan Hofer. When Stefan Hofer is killed in a mountaineering accident on the day after the wedding while on a tour with Andreas Marthaler, Andreas tries to care for Stefan's wife Emilie Hofer and the two children just as his friend asked him to. This is not easy for Emilie, Andreas and his girlfriend. Additionally Andreas Marthaler becomes the leader of the mountain rescue service in Ramsau which comes with its own challenges. At the end of the sixth series Andreas Marthaler tragically falls to his death to save a little girl. According to his wishes Markus Kofler becomes the new leader of the team who find this difficult at first as Markus Kofler was with Andreas as he died.  Characters  = Team members = Markus Kofler (played by Sebastian Ströbel) is the leader of the team. He is affected by the tragic death of Andreas Kofler, not made easier by the initial reactions of the rest of the team to which he responds defensively. He has inherited a dilapidated farm from his father and receives an invitation to stay at Emilie Hofer's until he has renovated it. He has an affair at the start of series seven with his former girlfriend whom he gave up when was misdiagnosed as paraplegic. Markus Kofler is an excellent mountaineer, enjoys risky stunts and says of himself that he is not a teamplayer and likes old-fashioned things.Series 7 Episode 6 (\\"Atemlos\\") written by Jens Maria Merz, first broadcast December 10, 2015 Tobias Herbrechter (played by Markus Brandl) has been a member of the mountain rescue team for many years and was its leader for a short period. He is a good mountaineer but not as good as Andreas and does not warm up to him initially. Tobias is courageous and caring but can be hot tempered. The rivals become fast friends however. Conflicts arise at times with his father, local hotelier and mayor Peter Herbrechter. Tobias falls in love with, and in series seven marries, Emilie Hofer. After the death of his friend Andreas Marthaler he is devastated and cannot accept Markus Kofler as a member of the mountain rescue team. As with Andreas - and Katharina Strasser - their friendship grows over time and Markus Kofler even ends up being the best man at his wedding. Michael Dörfler (played by Robert Lohr), usually called Michi, is the helicopter pilot. He is straightforward, keeps a cool head even in the worst of situations and has a dry sense of humour. He knows that there are limits to what courage and goodwill can achieve and sometimes needs to check his team members who know they can trust him. After an affair with Bea Kleinert he starts a relationship with Dr. Verena Auerbach in series seven. When Markus Kofler joins the team he accepts him even though the others are reticent. Katharina Strasser (played by Luise Bähr) joins the team in series six as paramedic and is Tobias' half-sister. She also works as a physiotherapist in the hotel owned by her father Peter Herbrechter. She is dedicated and assertive and has a close relationship to Emilie Hofer and is a bridesmaid at her wedding. She was in a relationship with Andreas Marthaler and had plans to go with him on his trip around the world. After his death and due to its circumstances she cannot accept the newcomer Markus Kofler easily. Her reservedness lasts throughout series seven. Benjamin Marasek (played by Mirko Lang), usually called Ben, joins the team in series seven. When Toni Stössl moves away with his new girlfriend, Ben takes over his sports shop and after his first involuntary rescue mission becomes a member of the mountain rescue team. He is open minded, technically adept and usually holds the fort in the mountain rescue office which is situated next to his shop. He tends to be tight-lipped about personal matters which nearly leads to his losing his shop. = Previous members = Andreas Marthaler (played by Martin Gruber) is the leader of the mountain rescue team of Ramsau am Dachstein. He is an expert mountaineer and wanted to open a climbing school in the USA until the death of his friend Stefan Hofer. After that he cares for Stefan's wife Emilie and her children and their farm, which creates problems with his girlfriend Sarah (played by Stephanie Stumph) who wanted to emigrate with him to the USA. Andreas also becomes leader of the local mountain rescue team and brings all his heart and expertise to this job. He and his girlfriend eventually separate but in series three they rekindle the relationship and want to marry. Sarah, however, dies from injuries sustained in an avalanche. In series six Andreas wants to give up mountaineering - apart from being a member of the mountain rescue team he up until then wanted to climb the K2 - and go on a world trip. On his last mission he gets to know Markus Kofler whom he appreciates as a mountaineer and who has applied for a job as a mountain rescuer in Ramsau. Later he decides to cut the rope that is holding him and a little girl, so that Markus Kofler can pull her up. Toni Stössel (played by Stefan Zinner (series 1) and Martin Klempnow (series 2-7) ) is owner of a sports shop in Ramsau, right next to the mountain rescue office. He is good-natured and a mountain rescuer through and through but flights in the helicopter do not agree with him. Thus he mostly stays in the office and takes care of the technical and logistic aspects of the situation. At the beginning of series seven he gets to know a young woman on a rescue mission and later decides to leave Ramsau with her. = Other recurring characters = Rudi (played by Michael Pascher) is a repairman at the heliport Christophorus 14. Emilie Hofer (played by Stefanie von Poser) is a friend of the whole team and especially Tobias Herbrechter whom she marries in series seven. She has two children and a farm which she manages with the help of Andreas Marthaler after the death of her first husband Stefan Hofer. Later she takes in Andreas' father Franz Marthaler and transforms the farm into a pension and in series seven invites Markus Kofler to stay as well even though her husband Tobias is still at loggerheads with him. She is strong, independent, cares deeply for her family and friends and lives in constant fear for them, especially her husband. Franz Marthaler (played by Heinz Marecek) is Andreas Marthaler's slightly quirky father and knows the dangers of the job first-hand because he was a mountain rescuer himself in his youth, together with Peter Herbrechter. After the small hotel he had run with his sister burned down Emilie Hofer takes him in. He was glad that his son would leave the mountain rescue team alive and well and is devastated by his death, especially because his wife also died in the mountains and is at first shocked to see that Emilie has invited Markus Kofler to stay as well. His quarrels with Peter Herbrechter often serve as comic relief. Peter Herbrechter (played by Michael König) is Tobias Herbrechter's and Katharina Strasser's father, hotelier and mayor. He can be as jovial as he can be quarrelsome. Conflicts with Franz Marthaler are the rule, the one always trying to outwit or outperform the other but they are joint in their care for their loved ones. Peter Herbrechter alone pronounces Emilie's name as \\"Emili-e\\" instead of \\"Emily\\". Dr. Verena Auerbach (played by Gundula Niemeyer) is a doctor in the nearby hospital. She knows the team well, having to patch them up regularly. She also tried being the paramedic on the team but could not continue due to her fear of heights.  Production  The name was changed from \\"Die Bergwacht\\" (roughly: \\"mountain watch\\"), which is the name of the German mountain rescue, to \\"Die Bergretter\\" (literally: \\"the mountain rescuers\\"). In Austria the organisation is called \\"Bergrettungsdienst\\" (literally: \\"mountain rescue service\\"), as seen on the logos on the team's jackets. The first episodes were 45 minutes long, since 2012 they are feature- length. Between series three and four a special was broadcast, a crossover production featuring Die Bergretter as well as Der Bergdoktor. Filming for the eighth series starts in February 2016.

She was the assistant of the chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius from 1808 to 1836. Anna Sundström has been referred to as the first female chemist in Sweden.Karolinska Institutet 200 År - 1810-2010 Biography Anna Persdotter was the daughter of the farmer Per Jansson, and later took the name Sundström. Early on, she moved to the capital to serve as a maid, and was in 1808 employed as the housekeeper of Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who was regarded as one of the fathers of modern chemistry. She acted effectively as his assistant and co worker during his research. During her work she was educated in chemistry and acquired a vast knowledge within it. Berzelius stated : \\"She is used to all my equipment and their names to such a degree that I could without hesitation make her distill Hydrochloric acid.\\" Sundström Sundström also administrated his laboratory as well as supervised his students, who affectionally called her \\"strict Anna\\". She was forced to end her employment when Berzelius married Elisabeth Poppius in 1836. Here is some of the work that was done by Berzelius during the period in which Sundstrom was assisting him. * The electrochemical reaction theory, which concludes that an electrical current can be sent between two substances to initiate a change of electrons. * Electrochemical dualism, one of the better known works. It dealt with the voltaic pile, which was used in the first electrical battery invented by Humphrey Davy in 1803, and its power to decomposes chemically in such a way that they were broken into tow oppositely charged components. * Stoichiometry in inorganic chemistry putting place the atomic weights of elements and the formulas for all inorganic compounds. This led later scientists coining it with the name stoichiometry * The dicoverry of the elements vanadium, lanthanum, didymium, erbium, terbium, and selenium.

According to the Serbian sources, area which included also nearby villages, was scene of around three thousand local non- uniformed armed force.

Earle, the president of Cane Hill College. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places along with many other Canehill properties in November 1982. The house, set well back from the highway, is a single-story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and a projecting gable-roof section on the front (western) facade. This projection has box columns supporting a delicate frieze and box cornice, with a raking cornice joining it to form a pediment. Chimneys are located at the gable ends. History Canehill was settled in 1827, a year prior to the establishment of Washington County. The Township of Cane Hill was established in 1829 and was mostly populated by members of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. The church leaders recognized the need for its congregation to be literate, and Canehill School was established in 1834. By 1850 it had been renamed to Canehill Collegiate Institute and was capable of granting two-year degrees. Two years later the Arkansas Legislature made Cane Hill College the second college in the state, one day after Arkansas College. Cane Hill College was burned by Union forces during the American Civil War, with only a dormitory being used as a hospital surviving. The college reorganized after the war under the supervision of new president Dr. Fountain R. Earle. The Earles moved to Canehill in 1858, but the College had trouble rebuilding after the war was over. Earle attempted to save the College by merging with the Canehill Female Academy, but pressure added by the new Arkansas Industrial University in Fayetteville caused the college to close in 1891. Architecture The building exhibits Greek Revival architecture and is one of the few remaining buildings in Canehill to demonstrate a classically proportioned front.

The plot follows the misadventures of two young friends who are forced into street hustling and ever-expanding life of crime when one impregnates the sister of the other and they need to get the money to pay for her to have an abortion. Made with a low budget and no professional actors, Colegas was reviled by critics but it was a commercial success.Torres, Diccionario del cine Español, p. 151 It is considered one of the classics of the quinqui film genre. Plot José is an unemployed eighteen-year-old living with his parents and four siblings in a cramped apartment in the slums of Madrid. Marginalized by poverty and with no prospects of finding a job, José spends his time with his best friend Antonio in a video arcade, smoking pot or in a fruitless search of work. When he is not with his pals (colegas in Spanish) José is with his girlfriend Rosario, who is Antonio’s sister. The situation in both families is grim. José has to share a small bedroom with his two hormone crazy younger brothers, while Antonio and Rosario have to deal with their irascible mother, Herminia. Things get more complicated when Rosario finds out she is pregnant. After revealing the news to the worried José, he tells what is going on to Antonio. Angry and disappointed with José for impregnating his sister the two best friends have a fist fight, but quickly regained their composure and reconcile. They are determined to help Rosario who is not sure if she is going to have the baby or not. Rosario makes inquires with some friends finding a nurse who can perform an illegal abortion, but she needs eight thousand pesetas to pay for it. Unable to find a job, but desperate to raise the money needed as soon as possible Antonio and Jose accept the proposal of another pal, el tatuado, to get the money hustling in a gay bathhouse. At the steaming room el tatuado introduces them to two old gay men who offered them money in exchange for sex. They accept, but at the last minute neither Jose nor Antonio can get to the end and run away. With the hustling failure behind them Antonio and Jose try to rob a store but they are equally inept at it. Deep down, they are too good, naive and inexperience to be career criminals. Pirri, José’s middle brother, who is much bolder, introduce them to Rogelio, a local professional crook, who recruits teenagers for his criminal activities. Rogelio sends Antonio and José to Morocco. Their task is to smuggle drugs hidden in pellets that they place inside their anuses using a lot of cream. The situation is very risky and uncomfortable, but the two pals are successful in their enterprise bringing the drugs into Spain undetected. The money that Rogelio pays them is enough to cover the abortion fee. However, Rogelio, aware of their intention, propose them to convince Rosario to have the baby since he can sell it to a couple abroad who can not conceive. Rogelio wants the deal to remain secret offering a considerable amount of money. He would also pay for the pregnancy and delivery expenses. Antonio and José discuss the deal with Rosario. Antonio prefers that his sister ends her pregnancy. José would leave it up to Rosario who is hesitant what to do. When the moment comes to have the abortion Rosario just can not do it. The three pals decide to take Rogelio’s offer. Shortly after, Rosario has a bitter argument home with her mother, who is completely against her daughter’s relationship with José. During the heated confrontation Rosario confesses that she is pregnant with José’s baby and decides to run away with him. There is also trouble in José’s household. The police arrive to his house. He initially think the police wants to arrest him, but they have come to detain Pirri, who has been involved in drug deals with Rogelio’s gang. Rosario’s hysterical mother comes with her husband to talk to José's parents and a huge argument ensures between the two families Antonio informs Rogelio that have been a change of plans. Rosario has changed her mind and has told their parents about her pregnancy. This brings their deal down. Rosario's pregnancy should have remained a secret. An argument begins and Antonio decides to run for his life after punching one of the members of Rogelio’s gang. they pursue him through an empty construction site. The guy that Antonio punched shoots at him and kills him. At Antonio's funeral the two grieving families are reunited. José declines his father offer of help if he marries Rosario. Instead he decides to live with her without marrying and raise their child together without help.

Kächler, Schlösser um Ulm, p. 6 mansion in the southern German municipality of Achstetten in Upper Swabia.  Location  Achstetten Castle is located at an elevation of about 503 m in the southern part of the municipality close to the parish church St Oswald and Agatha, the 18th-century country inn Rössle and the local town hall. The castle is situated on the edge of the valley of the river Rot to the east, and an elevated plain leading to the valley of the river Rottum to the west.  Appearance  Achstetten Castle is a spacious three-storey building in classicist style with a risalit in its centre.W. Willig, Landadel-Schlösser in Baden-Württemberg, p. 18 Two wings are loosely attached to the main structure at a right angle. These two wings function as economy buildings. On three sides the castle is surrounded by a large park, which is home to an enclosure where fallow deer are kept.H. Kächler, Schlösser um Ulm, p. 6 The main access to the castle is by a driveway measuring about long. Noteworthy of the interior are a classicist staircase, 19th century furniture, an iron stove from 1798, portraits of the Freyberg family and a porcelain collection.O. Beck, Kunst und Geschichte im Landkreis Biberach, p. 71 A raised and roofed passageway on wooden pillars connects the castle to the nearby church.H. Kächler, Schlösser um Ulm, p. 7 This passageway has a length of approximately .W. Willig, Landadel-Schlösser in Baden-Württemberg, p. 18 Passageways of this kind, which enabled the lord of the castle and his family to enter the church without being subject to the weather, were not uncommon; remnants of such a construction can also be seen at Großlaupheim Castle.A. Schahl, Die Bau und Kunstgeschichte von Laupheim und Umgebung, p. 314  History  A castle in Achstetten was first mentioned ion 1386. In a description dating from 1449, the castle is said to be a tall building, surrounded by moats and having two bridges.K. Diemer, Achstetten 1194–1795, p. 14 The castle was looted and burnt to the ground during the German Peasants' War in 1525 by members of the local peasant army, the Baltringer Haufe.K. Diemer, Achstetten 1194–1795, p. 20 A new castle was erected in 1583 which was described in 1620 by the visiting abbot of Ochsenhausen Abbey as a splendid palace. By around 1750 it consisted of an inner yard, surrounded by a large building which contained the stables, a derelict barn and a gate on the ground floor, the granary in the attic and living quarters in between. To the left of the gate there was a prison building and the dairy whereas on the right hand side of the gate more stables for cattle and sheep were located. In the outer yard stood the building allocated to the Vogt as well as a barn. The castle and its gardens were surrounded by a tall hedge which functioned as a living wall.K. Diemer, Achstetten 1194–1795, p. 14 The original castle was owned by the barons of Freyberg until 1639 after which time it changed hands several timesK. Diemer, Achstetten 1194–1795, p. 33 before being bought by Baron Beat Conrad Reuttner von Weyl in 1795. He had the current castle built in 1794–1796. The architect was Franz Anton Bagnato. The building works started one year before the actual contract of sale was signed. Beat Conrad Reuttner von Weyl must therefore have been quite certain of his future acquisition.H. Kächler, Schlösser um Ulm, p. 6 During the first half of the 19th century, the pond and the moats that surrounded the previous castle were drained and turned into a park. Most recently restoration works at the castle took place in 1982 and 1983. In 1996 a fountain, which already appeared in the original plans by Bagnato, was erected in the castle yard.  Current use  Achstetten Castle and its estate are in the possession of the family Reuttner von Weyl who still reside at the castle. It is also home to the offices for the administration and the management of the estate. The castle is in private hands and not accessible to the public.H.

The British captured her in 1814. The British named her HMS Palma, and then renamed her HMS Gloire. She was sold in 1817, never having been commissioned into the Royal Navy. In 1813, along with Alcmène, she served at Cherbourg, in the squadron of contre-amiral Amable Troude, to protect the harbour. Capture In early 1814, Commander Jean-Léon Émeric was put in charge of a two-frigate squadron comprising Iphigénie and Alcmène, under Commander Ducrest de Villeneuve,Fond Marine, t. 2, p. 495. for a cruise between the Azores and Cap-Vert, off Guinea. On 16 January 1814, the 74-gun third-rate ship of the line , her prize, the ex-French letter of marque brig Jason, and were in company when they spotted Alcmène and Iphigénie. After a chase that left Cyane far behind, Venerable captured Alcmène, though not without a fight. Venerable lost two men dead and four wounded, while the French lost 32 dead and 50 wounded.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 31, pp.245-5. Jason and Cyane tracked Iphigénie and initially fired on her but broke off the engagement because they were outgunned. Cyane continued the chase for over three days until Venerable was able to rejoin the fight after having sailed 153 miles in the direction she believed that Iphigénie had taken. On 20 January, after a 19-hour chase, or what amounted in all to a four-day chase for Iphigénie, Venerable captured the quarry, having again left Cyane behind. In the chase, Iphigénie cast off her anchors and threw her boats overboard in order to try to gain speed. She apparently did not resist after Venerable came up. Before meeting up with the British ships, the two French vessels had taken some eight prizes.James & Chamier (1837), Vol. 6, pp.259-61. The action resulted in the award in 1847, to any surviving claimants, of the Naval General Service Medal with clasps \\"Venerable 16 Jany 1814\\" and \\"Cyane 16 Jany. 1814\\". Venerable was able to locate Iphigénie because Commander Ducrest de Villeneuve of Alcmène was so angry at Captain Émeric, who was the senior French commander, for not having come alongside Venerable on the other side also to board, that he essentially revealed the rendezvous instructions to Admiral Durham. (Venerable was Durham's flagship). When some prisoners from Iphigénies crew were brought on Venerable, crew from Alcmène too were enraged. Durham had to station Royal Marines between them, with fixed bayonets, to prevent fighting from breaking out.Long (1895), p. 199. Fate A prize crew brought Iphigénie into Plymouth on 23 February 1814, and was laid up in ordinary. She was moved to Spithead in July. Capt. James A. Worth was in command of her, though she was never commissioned. The Admiralty named her Palma and then renamed her Gloire on 8 November. She was sold in September 1817 to a Mr. Freake for £1,750.Winfield (2008), p.181. Notes References ;Citations ;Bibliography * Fonds Marine.

The act states how the sale of any person as a slave was banned, and anyone buying or selling slaves would be booked under the Indian Penal Code with an offence carrying strict punishment.  Implementation and effect  Some East India Company officials opposed the act, citing Hindu and Muslim customs and maintaining the fact that the act would be seen as interference in traditional social structures. Evangelical politicians who had led successful slavery abolition campaigns in the West Indies prevailed and the Act was implemented. Historians are divided on whether the Act was able to exclude caste and slavery. The condition of workers in tea plantations in Tamil Nadu and Assam were compared to that of African, West Indian counterparts who worked in sugar plantations. Lack of alternatives meant tea plantation workers had become indentured labourers despite the Act, which historian Amalendu Guha maintained was a new form of slavery. A 1996 Human Rights Watch report refers to Manjari Dingwaney's book, Unredeemed Promises: The Law and Servitude, and states - > Various forms of debt bondage co-existed with formal slavery, and while the > British abolished slavery legislatively through the Anti-Slavery Act of > 1843, large numbers of former slaves traded their status for that of > perpetually bonded servitude.

The Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati is a painting by early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, dating to around 1431 and now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna, Austria. Niccolò Albergati was a diplomat working under Pope Martin V. During a peace congress in Antwerp, he met van Eyck, who portrayed him in a drawing in which the artist added notes on the colors in order to execute a later painting portrait. The drawing is now in the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen of Dresden, Germany. The cardinal is portrayed from three-quarters, as was usual in Flemish painting since as early as the 1430s, on a dark background which enhances the figure, which is instead subject to a bright light source. As common in van Eyck's work, attention to detail is maximum, thanks to his technique using successive layers of colors diluted with oil, which allowed him deep effects of transparency and lucidity. Comparison with the preparatory drawing shows that van Eyck changed several realistic details, such as the depth of the shoulders, the lower curve of the nose, the depth of the mouth and mainly the size of the ear, perhaps to strengthen the impression of seniority and, consequently, of authority of the cardinal.

No security breach was detected and details of the affair were ordered classified by Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance, leaking only in 1987 during Barnes' tenure in Chile. Although the American government, in particular Henry Kissinger, had supported the rise of dictator Augusto Pinochet, by 1985 the Chilean opposition started to campaign against extending his rule. Barnes supported the ultimately successful effort, angering Pinochet, who called him \\"Dirty Harry,\\" and advising the dictator that, \\"The ills of democracy can be cured only with more democracy.\\" In addition to agitating for democratic reform, Barnes contributed oversight to the 1988 Chilean national plebiscite against extending Pinochet's rule, funding a parallel vote tally and advertising for the anti-Pinochet campaign. Retirement Barnes retired from government service in 1988. Between 1994 and 2000 he served as the director of the Carter Center's Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Programs from 1994–2000.

It installs, maintains and repairs all the signalling and telecommunications on the LWR. Based primarily at , the department looks after the railways two functioning signal boxes at and . Ludborough 250px The original box was demolished by British Railways in early 1970s, after the line had closed to passengers. The new box was constructed by the LWR between 1994 and 1996, and is a close representation of the original. The 18 lever frame inside the box is the original frame from in Grimsby. This box was standing until 1991 when it was destroyed by fire. Also inside Ludborough box is the original gate wheel from Hainton Street which opened the level crossing gates there. Ludborough box was passed by HMRI in October 2004 for use and was officially opened in April 2005. Out of the 18 levers, at the present time, only 4 are in use. However a future scheme is currently being worked on that will bring 8 levers into use. All the signals with the exception of the Down Starter (LU3) have SPT's (Signal Post Telephones) fitted to them. These allow both the driver and signalman to contact each other. Ludborough currently operates two Great Northern Railway somersault signals (LU3 down starter and LU14 Up Inner Home). These type of signals were used all over the East Lincolnshire Railway, and is appropriate for the railway's needs. Future plans will see the box operate 3 additional signals and a ground frame release operated from the box. North Thoresby North Thoresby signal box is a 7 lever Eastern region ground frame that has been installed to operate the track and signalling layout at North Thoresby. It operates two main line signals, two shunting signal for access to and from the siding, a facing point lock and a facing point for access in and out of the siding. With No.1 lever being released by the annetts key making up the final lever in the frame. North Thoresby signal box was commissioned on 7 August 2009. The signalling type used here is a mixture of both ex-BR signalling and Ex LNER. All signals are of the Upper quadrant signal variety. This means that when the signals are cleared the move upwards to a 45 degree angle to show all clear. If the wire snaps the signal automatically fails safe and returns to danger. A track circuit runs over the main line and siding to give an indication to the signalman as to the whereabouts of the train and also to prevent the points from being moved under a train. Future The future for the department is a good one. With over of railway to re-build and four level crossings to re-instate, there is a lot of work to carry out. The Lincolnshire Wolds Railway is currently aiming towards Utterby halt (the next adjacent level crossing in the direction of Louth) and is also currently rebuilding the whole layout at the Louth end of the yard. This will include extending and altering the engine shed, laying new point work and extending the main line towards Utterby and updating the signalling accordingly. This will include 2 new signals and the ground frame. One of the new signals will be a 3 aspect colour light and the other will be a GNR somersault. When this work is complete the railway will then progress towards Utterby Halt and ultimately Louth.

The story is unusual in Solzhenitsyn's canon in that it is set contemporary time, the early 1960s. The action takes place in a provincial town like Ryazan where the author lived after his release from the Gulag and his return from exile in the 1950s. In the town, the students of the local college help to build new college premises by doing most of the work themselves. On completion, the Soviet authorities order that the building should be handed over to a research institute and the students are told that this is \\"for the good of the cause\\". The story is an overt criticism of the lack of democracy that prevailed at the time and the lack of integrity of political leaders. The novella is longer and less successful than the author's others, such as An Incident at Krechetovka Station and Matryona's Place and in 1973, the critic Christopher Moody – a former lecturer in Russian at the University of the Witwatersrand – wrote, \\"For the Good of the Cause is...a political polemic and was treated as such by the Soviet press\\".

It consisted of two stores, a boarding house, post office and a saw and planing mill. The latter was built by W. H. Coolidge in 1884.

It has also appeared on a number of Cheap Trick compilation albums, including The Essential Cheap Trick. It has also been covered by many artists including Big Black, Neon and Vince Neil. Like many of Cheap Trick's songs, it was played in early midwest concerts starting in 1975. \\"He's a Whore\\" never became a live staple for Cheap Trick, although they began to play the song in concert occasionally in the 1990s and 2000s. Lyrics The genesis of the song came from Nielsen coming up with the title and liking the idea and building the song around it. He liked the fact that the phrase \\"he's a whore\\" is not as obvious as if the title was \\"She's a Whore,\\" and that a song about a gigolo involves a sense of role reversal. The lyrics imply that the central character is an unattractive but wealthy woman. However, according to Nielsen, the song is not just about sex. Nielsen has stated that \\"Whoring means so many different things, it doesn’t just mean having sex, but someone who does anything for money.\\" Nielsen further noted that the song encompasses radio stations and people who would do anything for money, and indeed the lyrics include the line \\"I'm a Whore, I'll do anything for money,\\" and this is further emphasized when lead singer Robin Zander sings \\"I'm a Whore\\" and Nielsen sings as a reply \\"He'll do anything for money.\\" Critical reception Allmusic critic Greg Prato described the song as one of the \\"more straightforward compositions, both lyrically and musically\\" on Cheap Trick's debut album and as one of the band's \\"most punk-based and energetic\\" songs. The song begins with Nielsen playing a descending, single note pattern on his guitar, while Tom Petersson plays a similar pattern on bass. Author Mike Hayes describes the opening as \\"aggressive, amphetamine-charged chords.\\" Critic Robert Christgau praised the song's hook on the phrase \\"any time at all.\\" Nielsen's lead guitar licks propel the song along. Music video Cheap Trick filmed a promotional video of the song, directed by Chuck Lashon, in which the band performed the song while mugging for the cameras.

In early 1922 young Sumedankara Thera set sail from Dodanduwa, Southern Province and arrived at Muttur, Trincomalee by a maha-oruwa (local coaster). He had to walk the 14 miles to Seruvila and trekked four miles of thick jungle before arriving at a place strewn with ruins. He soon undertook the task of restoration with the patronage of a few Southern Sinhala Buddhist traders in Trincomalee, Mudliyar D. D. Weerasinghe and the Archeological Department. In 1931, the stupa was opened to the public veneration. The temple is among the sixteen holiest Buddhist shrines Solosmasthana in Sri Lanka and thought to contain relics of four Buddhas: Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, Kassapa and Gautama. It is also believed to be the seventeenth place where the Lord Buddha visited during his visits to the country and the only place where the Buddha offered flowers. He is the teacher of Ven.

History The work was commissioned by the rich merchant Matthäus Landauer of Nuremberg for a chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity and All the Saints in the Zwölfbrüderhaus (\\"House of Twelve Brothers\\"), which he had founded with Erasmus Schiltkrot in 1501. The house was a charity institution which could house up to twelve artisans who were unable to sustain themselves with their work; Landauer himself lived here from 1510 until his death.Carty, 146 The altarpiece was commissioned in 1508, but was delivered three years later, when it was placed in the church. Description The altar had no movable panels, as in numerous previous similar installations, and was included in a rich frame, also designed by Dürer. There is a carved depiction of the Last Judgement at the top of the frame, and it also displays the donors' coats of arms. The crowded altarpiece depicts the Trinity, with God the Father holding a crucifix with a still-alive Jesus. Above them, in a cloud of light surrounded by cherubims, is the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove. God the Father wears an imperial crown and a wide gilt cloak, lined in green and supported by angels. The artist paints a host of male and female saints of Heaven, inspired by Augustine, who are led by John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary, respectively. Below, the human multitudes are divided between religious men and women (left, led by the pope), and laymen, led by the Holy Roman Emperor—a division similar to that already adopted by Dürer in the Feast of the Rosary (1506). At left, near a cardinal who is perhaps interceding for him, is the aged Matthäus Landauer, wearing rich garments and putting down his hat. A peasant, with one of his tools, represents the poor classes. On the right is an enigmatic queen whose face is entirely hidden by a veil, which leaves only the eyes visible. The lower section is occupied by a large landscape with the dawn above a lake, among hills, inspired by landscapes by Albrecht Altdorfer and Joachim Patinir. There is also a self-portrait of Dürer holding a cartouche with the signature and date inscription: Gallery File:Albrecht Dürer 053.jpg  The altarpiece with Dürer's frame File:Durer, Adoration of the Trinity 05.jpg  Detail with the veiled queen File:Durer, Adoration of the Trinity 07.jpg  Detail with self-portrait and inscription  Sources  *Carty, C.

The volcanic field contains more than 220 Pleistocene- to-Holocene monogenetic vents. The best-known eruption occurred about 1670 radiocarbon years ago from the Xitle scoria cone, NE of the Volcán Ajusco lava-dome complex, which at forms the highest peak of the Sierra Chichinautzin.

High Speed employs the game engine that Rare previously developed for Pin*Bot (1990). Rare adapted the game from the pinball machine High Speed, which was designed by Steve Ritchie and released by Williams Electronics in 1986. The following year, Williams Electronics was renamed WMS Industries prior to its initial public offering. In 1995, Williams Entertainment, a division of WMS Industries, published a sequel, The Getaway, for the Game Boy, based on Ritchie's pinball machine The Getaway: High Speed II. Gameplay Similar to Pin*Bot, the NES version of High Speed plays identical to the pinball machine of the same name, but with a few new elements added in, such as collecting safes and helicopters that allow the player to play bonus levels, where lots more points can be scored. The player can also collect money bags of the same name, and has to avoid enemies that will destroy the ball or the flippers, such as bombs and tumbleweeds. The object of the main game (as in the pinball machine) is to activate the police chase mode by hitting the nine stoplight targets, changing the main stoplight on the ramp from green to yellow, and then to red. Once the light is red, shooting the ball up the ramp starts the police chase mode. Shooting the ball up the ramp again escapes the police and starts multi-ball (where three balls are in play), and shooting one of the balls up the ramp a third time wins the hideout jackpot (beginning at 250,000 points and growing until it is collected).

They had three sons: *Denzil [Denzell] Onslow (29 Jan 1731 – bef. 1765) *Middleton Onslow (17 April 1732 – 1801) *Capt. Richard Onslow (1734 – aft. 1765) Denzil succeeded his second cousin Richard Onslow in 1727 as receiver general of the Post Office when the latter wished to enter Parliament on the family interest at Guildford. Denzil, in turn, gave up the office when he, too, entered Parliament for Guildford in 1740 at a by-election, triggered when his nephew Richard succeeded to a peerage. Elected again in 1741, he was a consistent supporter of the Government, and was appointed in 1743 as Paymaster of the Works. He did not stand again at the election of 1747, as the Place Act 1742 made incompatible his seat on the Board of Works with a place in Parliament. He was questioned over errors in his Post Office accounts in 1748, but remained paymaster until 1755. In 1753, he inherited Kevington Hall (which has been remodelled internally into the county primary school of St Mary Cray, Greater London)Kevington County Primary School - Grade II* - from his first cousin, Richard Manning. He became instead a commissioner of stamp duties until 1757, and then of the salt office until his death in 1765. In 1764, the Treasury was inquiring into his arrears as Paymaster of the Works, and he died owing over £1500 () to the Treasury, a debt still unsettled in 1783.

His first book \\"Projects in Sight, Sound and Sensation\\" was published in 1974. He studied nuclear physics at Sonoma State University during 1971–1975. His career began in 1977 when he met Steve Jobs at the Home Brew Computer Club at Stanford University. Jobs introduced the Apple I to the group and Waite was one of the first to purchase the single board personal computer at the Byte Shop in San Rafael. By this point Waite had published several computer books and was working on a book about computer graphics. Jobs found out about an elaborate weather station Waite had running on his houseboat in Greenbrae, California and attached to the Apple I, and invited himself up to see it. When Jobs arrived he spent the entire time bragging about the new Apple II he had developed with Steve Wozniak. It was 10X better than the Apple I he claimed and invited Waite to come to Cupertino to see it. Waite met Jobs at the new offices of Apple Computer. Impressed with his books Jobs offered Waite a job as Apple's head of documentation, along with stock options. Waite accepted and asked if he could come in later in the morning since he lived in Marin county. Jobs told him that if he worked at Apple he had to be there 24 x 7. Waite balked, and told Jobs he could not live in Cupertino's asphalt jungle. Jobs was infuriated, called him a bozo and said he was blowing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Waite told Jobs he felt he would be successful on his own one day as a writer or publisher but would still love to do something else to help Apple. Jobs told him to meet with Mike Markkula and Mike assigned Waite a job writing a magazine article comparing the Apple II to the Commodore 64 and learning the Commodore apart with a stiletto knife. After that Waite decided he was not destined to work in the computer industry but rather wanted to create new kinds of books and so he worked even harder at being a writer. After writing 5 books on his own he began working with more of his friends in the hobby world. He enlisted his old College of Marin professors to help him write books about programming languages and soon has a reputation as one of the major shakers in the burgeoning computer book industry. He established Mitch Waite Group at 1977, which has published more than 80 titles in computer programming field. The company was later sold to Simon & Schuster.

Kaiser was located in the town of Lake along the current route of the Tuscobia State Trail, west-southwest of Park Falls. The town was marked on USGS maps as late as 1941.  History  The village of Kaiser was platted by, and named after Arnold E. Kaiser in 1911. Mr. Kaiser was a logger and civic leader from nearby Park Falls. Farmland near the area of Kaiser had been settled as early as 1881. John Stehwein homesteaded 160 acres of land along County Road E, an area which became known as \\"Kaiser's Corner\\". C.M. Gardner, another early settler, was the namesake of nearby Gardner Lake. Walter Loomer built a small country store in October 1901. The store, a Post Office, and a one-room school were already open when the plat for the village was laid out. The country surrounding Kaiser was one of the better farming areas in northern Price County. Much of it was level and loamy with few rocks in the soil. This attracted many settlers who were interested in farming, and by 1920 Kaiser had some of the most productive dairy farms in northern Price County. The sawmill that provided work for many residents was built by J.S. Blackwell in 1905, on a pond located about one-half mile west of the \\"Kaiser's Corner\\" spot. Blackwell contracted with J.W. and E.W. Noble to build and operate the mill. Logs were brought in by neighboring farmers and the lumber was then either sold, or shipped out to Park Falls by horse-drawn wagon. Operations expanded considerably when the Omaha Railway Line approached Park Falls and built a siding to the mill in 1910. = Hopeful future, and eventual downfall= Arnold Kaiser, a contract logger, then bought out the Nobles, and ran the mill with Blackwell. He platted his village where the sawmill spur route met the main line of the Omaha Railway, and attempted to sell lots in the village for homes and businesses. He envisioned a prosperous community, named after himself. Although the Kaiser village was the terminus for the Omaha Railway Line for three years before track was extended to Park Falls, only one house was ever built in the platted village. It stood alone in the clearing and was later known as \\"The Chicken House\\". A number of homes, a post office, school, and general store were all built in the vicinity of the sawmill and the \\"Kaiser's Corner\\" spot. This was the real Kaiser community, and not the streets and lots that were laid out by Mr. Kaiser. The big plans of Mr. Kaiser, of a large populated community, remained a dream that never materialized.  References   External links  *Arnold E.

French original. Black and white engraving The Troelfth Cake, German version, in color The Troelfth Cake (also The Twelfth Cake, The Royal Cake, The Cake of Kings, from the , , Placek królewski) is a 1773 French allegory and satire on the First Partition of Poland. It is likely that the original title in English was intended to say \\"The Twelfth Cake\\", alluding to the division of a King Cake (also called a Twelfth Cake), but this became corrupted in later reprints. There are at least four variants of the composition, which is most common as an engraving, but also as at least one color painting; the original was likely drawn by Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune and engraved by Nicolas Noël Le Mire (although another source calls them merely the authors of the most famous variant). Authors of other variants included the German artist Johannes Esaias Nilson. The Troelfth Cake shows the rulers of the three countries that participated in the partition tearing a map of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth apart. The outer figures demanding their share are Catherine II of Russia and Frederick II of Prussia. Catherine is glaring at her former lover, the Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski, and (in some variants of the engraving) Frederick is pointing to Danzig (Gdańsk) with a sword (although Prussia acquired the territories around it, Gdańsk still remained with the Commonwealth). The inner figure on the right is the Habsburg Emperor Joseph II. On his left is the beleaguered Stanisław August Poniatowski, who (in some variants of the engraving) is experiencing difficulty keeping his crown on his head, and in another, has already lost it. Above the scene is Pheme (with manifestos from the partitioning powers in the German variant). The composition gained notoriety in contemporary Europe; its distribution was banned in several European countries, including France. This ban, and associated penalties, meant that many variants of this work have been anonymous. The image was highly influential on numerous other satirical works of its time. The changes between the French original and the German version, both portrayed here, were done to reduce the sexual content of the satire (the look between the lovers, the phallic sword).

Feaster (born May 15, 1973) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for Holy Cross before playing professionally in Germany, Argentina, Australia and France, as well as playing two seasons in the United States minor leagues. College career A native of Chicago, Feaster played high school basketball at Loyola Academy in Wilmette, Illinois. Feaster's college career at Holy Cross began in 1991–92. In 29 games, he averaged 8.0 points and 3.2 rebounds and was named the Patriot League Rookie of the Year. He followed that campaign with a sophomore season in which the Crusaders placed second in the conference regular season, won the Patriot League Tournament, and earned a berth in the 1993 NCAA Tournament. Feaster led the team in scoring at 17.7 points per game for the season and was also named the conference tournament's most valuable player. It was Holy Cross' first NCAA Tournament appearance since the 1979–80 season, and with a 24–7 record, just their third 20-win season since then as well. As a junior in 1993–94, Feaster averaged 28.0 points per game, which placed him second in the nation behind Purdue's Glenn Robinson. Despite the prolific scoring, the Crusaders only finished with a 14–14 record. He was selected to the All- Patriot League team for the second straight year. Feaster's final season in 1994–95 saw him earn his third all-conference selection behind a third consecutive season in which he led Holy Cross in scoring at 25.0 points per game. This mark also ranked him ninth nationally, and for his efforts he was named the Patriot League Player of the Year. When Feaster finished his college career, he had scored a then-Patriot League record 2,224 points (in 2012–13, his record would be broken by Lehigh's C. J. McCollum). Despite setting the conference scoring record, he still only ranks second all-time at Holy Cross. Ron Perry scored 2,524 points between 1976–77 and 1979–80. Professional career Feaster went undrafted in the 1995 NBA draft. Between 1996 and 1998, he played in Germany. After a one-game stint with Boca Juniors in Argentina to begin the 1998–99 season, he returned to the United States, where he won IBA Sixth Man of the Year honors with the Rochester Skeeters.Semi Pro Hoops Time Tunnel After not playing during the 1999–2000 season, he spent the 2000–01 season with the La Crosse Bobcats of the Continental Basketball Association.

He continued on with the Wildcats in 2002–03, helping Perth reach the NBL Grand Final series, where they lost 2–0 to the Sydney Kings. That year, he earned Wildcats Club MVP honors and was named to the All-NBL Second Team. He remained in Australia for the 2003–04 season, joining the Victoria Giants.Player statistics for Rob Feaster In January 2005, he joined French team Reims Champagne Basket.

Not being a DOS extender by itself, DPMS is a minimal set of extended DOS memory management services to allow slightly modified DOS resident system extensions (RSX) such as device drivers or TSRs (as so called DPMS clients) to relocate themselves into extended memory and run in 16-bit or 32-bit protected mode while leaving only a tiny stub in conventional memory as an interface to communicate with the conventional DOS environment. The DPMS clients do so through DPMS services provided by a previously loaded DPMS server. The necessary size of the remaining stub depends on the type of driver, but often can be reduced downto a few hundred bytes for just the header even for complex drivers. By executing the driver in extended memory and freeing up conventional memory, DPMS not only allows very large drivers to load and take advantage of the available memory, but also to leave more memory available for normal DOS drivers to load or non-extended DOS applications to execute within the space constraints of the conventional memory area. This will also help increase the amount of free system resources under Windows. Providing unified interfaces for the software to allocate and use memory in protected mode without having to tunnel all requests through real mode DOS, DPMS at the same time can help improve system performance as well.  DPMS  DPMS was originally developed by Novell's Digital Research GmbH, Germany, in 1992. It is compatible with any DOS and can coexist with memory managers and DOS extenders such as DPMI, VCPI, etc. The DPMS API is reentrant and compatible with multitaskers such as the DR-DOS multitasker or DESQview. By providing a built-in DPMS VxD-driver, it is also compatible with Windows 3.x and Windows 9x. The DPMS server must be loaded after the memory managers (and before the drivers using it), either as a \\"DPMSXXX0\\" device driver per DEVICE statement in CONFIG.SYS (preferred method), or later as a TSR. For debug purposes (for example in conjunction with Microsoft's WDEB386.EXE), SDK-versions of EMM386.EXE 3.00 can alternatively provide DPMS services via through a built-in DPMS.SYS module, then running at ring 1 instead of ring 0, as with the stand-alone version of DPMS.EXE. The option allows debugging under older NuMega SoftICE versions. Depending on circumstances the server will occupy between about 700 to 1400 bytes of conventional memory by itself and cannot be loaded into UMBs. The DPMS server will require at least a 286 machine to run, but since DPMS-enabled software can be designed in a way so that it continues to execute in conventional memory if DPMS services are not available, the software does not need to give up compatibility with systems not providing DPMS services, either because DPMS is not loaded or not available (for example on pre-286 processors). On 386 CPUs (and higher), the DPMS server will not only provide a set of 16-bit, but also a set of 32-bit services. Even on these machines, DPMS can be forced to load only its 16-bit services using the option. DPMS will allocate memory either through VCPI or XMS, depending on what kind of memory is available. VCPI will typically call down to XMS as well. Newer versions of DPMS can be forced to use one of these interfaces using the option. In some versions, it is possible to specify the maximum amount of extended memory to be allocated with . DPMS registering services can be disabled or re-enabled at any time after load using the or command, however, this will only affect new drivers loaded, not those already running and using DPMS. There are basically three revisions of the DPMS specification, DPMS beta, DPMS 1.0 (original Novell DOS 7 shipment) and DPMS 1.1 (since March 1994 update). The 1.0 specification continued to support the beta specification as well, whereas the 1.1 (and higher) implementation does not. DPMS saw its debut in beta versions of DR DOS \\"Panther\\" in October 1992, which, besides others, came with DPMS-enabled versions of the Super PC-Kwik disk cache, Addstor's SuperStor disk compression, and DEBUG as \\"stealth\\" protected mode system debugger. While DPMS was already called \\"DOS Protected Mode Services\\" at this time, the DPMS.EXE/DPMS.SYS 0.10 driver would still display \\"DOS Protected Mode Server\\" startup messages. The PCMCIA card services CS in PalmDOS were DPMS-enabled as well. Later retail products such as Novell DOS 7 and Personal NetWare 1.0 in December 1993 also came with many DPMS-enabled drivers such as the file deletion tracking component DELWATCH 2.00, the adaptive disk cache NWCACHE 1.00, NWCDEX 1.00, a CD-ROM redirector extension, the peer-to-peer networking server SERVER 1.20, and STACKER 3.12, the disk compression component. DPMS was also provided by Caldera OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and 7.03, which, at least in some releases, added DPMS-enabled issues of DRFAT32 (a FAT32 redirector extension), LONGNAME (VFAT long filename support) and VDISK (virtual RAM disk). DR-DOS 7.03 contains the latest version of DPMS 1.44. DPMS was also provided by IBM's PC DOS 7.0 and PC DOS 2000, which came with an older version of Novell's DPMS server and a DPMS-enabled version of Stacker 4.02 bundled. Stac Electronics also produced a DPMS-enabled stand-alone version of Stacker 4\\\\. PC-Kwik Corporation's Super PC-Kwik 6.xx for DOS and their Power Pak 4.0 for Windows also included the DPMS-enabled disk cache SUPERPCK in 1994. Some third-party DOS driver suites such as the Eicon Diva or High Soft Tech GmbH (HST) Saphir CAPI ISDN drivers or PCMCIA/PCCard driver stacks such as Award's CardWare 2.5 (or higher) are known to support DPMS as well. After Phoenix's acquisition of Award, their PCMCIA drivers 6.0 (and higher) have been sold off to UniCore. CardWare 6.0 and 7.0 were available through APSoft, Socket Services (SSxxxxxx.EXE), Card Services (PCCS.EXE), PC Enable (PCENABLE.EXE), and card handlers (PCDISK.EXE, PCSRAM.EXE, PCATA.EXE, and PCFLASH.EXE) could use DPMS. Through LXE's integration of the stack into their ruggedized DOS PCs, DPMS also found its way into the Datalight ROM-DOS suite. In 1999, Funk Software introduced a DPMS-enabled version of their remote control software Proxy Host, allowing PHOST to occupy only 9 KB of conventional memory. The Remote Dial-in Client software REMOTE for the 833 Remote Access Server by Perle Systems could take advantage of DPMS for the same purpose at least since 2002. SciTech Software's Kendall Bennett investigated the possibility to add DPMS support to their DOS driver suite around 1999 as well, but this was never published. Bret Johnson developed DPMS-enabled Print Screen to file (PRTSCR) and USB drivers for DOS.  CLOAKING  In 1993, Helix Software Company's memory manager NETROOM 3 introduced a feature very similar to Novell's DPMS: CLOAKING was used to relocate Helix's and third-party drivers into extended memory and run them at ring 0. Providing its functions as an extension to the real-mode EMS and XMS interface, its protected mode services are available under INT 2Ch. A CLOAKING developer's kit was available which included a NuMega SoftICE debugger. Cloaked driver or TSR software hooking interrupts had to leave a small 11-byte stub in conventional memory which would invoke the CLOAKING server to pass execution to the protected mode portion of the driver software. CLOAKING includes support for seamless operation under Windows 3.x and Windows 95, providing compatible INT 2Ch services to protected mode drivers via a Windows VxD, as well as seamless debugging through Windows start-up using SoftICE. This ability to transition between protected mode host environments is also the subject of a patent. CLOAKING integrates into and works with existing virtual memory control programs, without switching descriptor tables or resetting the control registers. This allows for faster interrupt processing, according to Helix's documentation. In contrast to Novell's DPMS, Helix's CLOAKING driver can be loaded high, but it does not run on 286 machines, though it does support 16-bit services and program structure on a 386. Also, CLOAKING 2.01 has been found to be incompatible with the DR- DOS multitasker (). If no DPMS server is present when CLOAKING.EXE loads, CLOAKING will, by default, also provide a cloaked DPMS server at a mere 100 bytes increase of its DOS memory footprint. However, it can also coexist with a DPMS server loaded before CLOAKING. The loading of its built-in DPMS server can be suppressed using the parameter. DPMS-enabled drivers will work with both DPMS or CLOAKING, but not vice versa. In NETROOM v3.04, Supplemental Disk distribution dated \\"2-10-95,\\" the password protected resource file NR.ZIP (679,271 KB) has an undocumented file; DPMSCLK.EXE (13,904 KB), \\"Cloaked DPMS Server v3.03\\". The file does not reveal support for any options or parameters when queried using the standard help option, . This file is not unzipped by the NETROOM 3 SETUP.EXE program and does not install. There is no hint of the file's existence in the NETROOM 3 software manual or any of the on-disk program documentation and human-readable files. This final version of NETROOM as released basically ignored DPMS. Helix licensed a version of Award Software's BIOS and developed cloaked system and video BIOSes which executed entirely in protected mode, reducing their real-mode memory footprint down to 8 KB (instead of 96 KB) and used these as run-time BIOS in conjunction with their NETROOM memory manager. As part of their Multimedia Cloaking product, Helix provided cloaked versions of Logitech's MOUSE 6.33 driver, Microsoft's MSCDEX, and a home-grown disk cache to replace Microsoft's SmartDrive drivers. There was also a product named Multimedia Stacker consisting of Stac's DPMS- enabled Stacker 4.01 with Helix's above suite of cloaked DOS utilities. The Logitech DOS mouse driver since MouseWare 6.50 was enabled to take advantage of CLOAKING as well, thereby reducing the mouse driver's memory footprint visible to DOS applications from 27 KB to 1 KB. CLOAKING was also licensed to Symantec for their utility suite, to Corel for their CD Creator and Corel SCSI products, and to SMC Networks for their Ethernet drivers. Novell's DPMS utility may not be used to temporarily disable DPMS with a command if those DPMS services are provided by CLOAKING instead of DPMS itself, because Helix's implementation will erroneously not only disallow new drivers to register with DPMS, but completely switch off DPMS services even for already loaded drivers, leading to a system crash.  NIOS  In 1993, Novell had announced plans to convert their resident workstation management utilities as well as their DOS network driver stacks (shells, redirectors and requestors) to use DPMS, however, only the Personal NetWare server component was modified to actually take advantage of it. Announced in 1993, Novell introduced a new 32-bit DOS/Windows NetWare client (Client 32) based on ODI32/NIOS in 1996, replacing the former 16-bit client based on ODI/VLM. The NIOS (NetWare I/O Subsystem) client for DOS and Windows used techniques very similar to DPMS or Cloaking to relocate and run the code of the loaded NLMs (NetWare Loadable Modules) in protected mode and extended memory in order to reduce the conventional memory footprint of the network stack down to about 2 to 5 KB. NIOS neither required nor used DPMS or Cloaking directly, and it did not provide a generic interface which could be used by non-NLM modules, however, it was certainly inspired by the DPMS technology and it can coexist with both of them. While Novell's Personal NetWare was published unmodified as part of the DR-DOS suite by its newer owners Caldera, Lineo and DeviceLogics up to 2018, Personal NetWare had been abandoned since 1995 within Novell itself. This led to the situation that Novell never published a driver to support the Personal NetWare protocol under the newer 32-bit ODI32/NIOS stack, so that users of Personal NetWare, who could take advantage of the PNW server module's DPMS capabilities already, were bound to continue to use the memory-consuming ODI/VLM 16-bit client with its protocol driver.

Early life and education Carlton was born in Reading, Berkshire, England, moving to London within a year. His formal education ended when he left Kilburn Grammar School to enroll in London’s Saint Martin’s School of Art for a Design course. During the third year of fashion design, he was holidaying in Paris (making the rounds with his design folio) when he was hired on the spot as assistant designer at Nina Ricci’s maison de couture. He stayed there a year before joining Andre Courrèges, who had just left Balenciaga to set up his own small house in Paris. After two years with Courrèges, he attempted to join Hubert de Givenchy, but that designer advised him to be an illustrator. Carlton began illustrating articles for ELLE Magazine, becoming a freelance artist for The London Sunday Times, The Daily Mail, The Observer, The New York Times, Mademoiselle Magazine and many other publications. Writing career He moved to New York, where he began writing freelance articles for The Village Voice and McCalls, often centered on fashion, social issues or the media. After two years in New York, he returned to London to become Men's Wear Editor of The Sunday Times and a regular contributor to the Magazine with articles on Donyale Luna and the Houston Astrodome. Ernest Hecht of Souvenir Press commissioned a “fashion novel”, preferably centred on Carnaby Street. The Rag Dolls (1968) was the first of four novels published in UK and United States which Carlton wrote under the pen-name Simon Cooper. He used his real name on a novel for the first time for the 1988 novel Labels, (Bantam Books) which sold over a million copies in USA, and was translated into many languages, including Hebrew. It has been published three separate times in the UK. His first non-fiction book, The Scarf, a history of the silk scarf, followed. (Stuart Tabori Chang 1989). Sacrifice, another novel for Bantam Books, was published in 1991. His childhood memoir about an eccentric family: The Handsomest Sons In the World, (Duckworth, 2001), was one of the London Sunday Times “100 Best Books” of that year, one of six in the biography category. He returned to fiction with Heaven, Hell & Mademoiselle (Orion, 2010) a novel of the 1968 Paris fashion world where ‘Mademoiselle’ is Coco Chanel herself. The following year, 2011, Orion Books re-published Labels, now itself labelled as “a cult classic”.

It was established in 2008, as a fundraising drive to benefit non-profit guide dog organizations accredited by the International Guide Dog Federation).accredited It is observed during the month of September. History National Guide Dog Month was first inspired by Dick Van Patten, who was impressed by the intelligence and training of guide dogs. During a visit to the campus of the Guide Dogs of the Desert in Palm Springs, California, Van Patten was blindfolded to experience how guide dogs provide assistance and mobility to blind people. After learning that the costs to raise and train a guide dog exceed $40,000 and can take up to two years, Van Patten was inspired to help raise awareness and money for guide dog schools. Van Patten served as an honorary Board Member for the Guide Dogs of the Desert. Through his pet food company Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance Pet Foods, he has underwritten all costs for the promotion of National Guide Dog Month to ensure that all money raised would directly benefit non-profit, accredited guide dog schools in the United States. In 2008, Van Patten enlisted the support of the Petco Foundation, to organize a fundraising campaign through their retail stores. The San Diego based retailer piloted the first guide dog fundraiser in the Southern California area to benefit the Guide Dogs of the Desert, based in Palm Springs, California. In 2009 National Guide Dog Month was established to benefit the non-profit guide dogs schools accredited by the International Guide Dog Federation. In 2009, National Guide Dog Month was established for the month of May, however in 2010, it was moved to September due to conflicts with other national fundraising drives. Beneficiaries In 2011, the non-profit guide dog schools in the United States listed by IGDF were listed as beneficiaries of National Guide Dog Month. 100% proceeds will be donated to the following guide dog training facilities: · Guide Dogs for the Blind · Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind · Guide Dogs of Texas, Inc. · Guide Dogs of the Desert · Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation, Inc. · Southeastern Guide Dogs · Leader Dogs for the Blind · The Seeing Eye, Inc. · Freedom Guide Dogs for the Blind, Inc. · Guiding Eyes for the Blind Use of registered charity Fundraising for National Guide Dog Month is collected from donors and disbursed by the Petco Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation (#33-0845930) that supports other IRS (Internal Revenue Service) designated non-profit pet related groups. The Petco Foundation is listed and rated by Charity Navigator. Celebrity spokespersons The use of celebrity spokespersons to attract media interest has helped National Guide Dog Month gain awareness with American consumers. In 2009, while Paula Abdul appeared as a judge on American Idol blind contestant Scott MacIntyre was presented with a guide dog to represent National Guide Dog Month. In 2010, as spokesperson, Nicollette Sheridan helped raise awareness through various interviews and appearances. In 2010, actress Katrina Bowden made promotional appearances in support of National Guide Dog Month. In 2011, spokespersons Omar Miller and Eva LaRue appeared at a graduation ceremony at the Guide Dogs for the Blind campus in San Rafael, California to honor Dr Cecilia von Beroldingen, with the first annual Change A Life Award. Von Beroldingen is a blind scientist who, with her guide dog Neoki, given to her through the program, has been able to continue her work for the California Department of Justice Criminalistics Institute Forensic Training Facility in Sacramento. Miller and La Rue, who portray CSI investigator characters Natalia Boa Vista and Walter Simmons on the television series CSI: Miami presented von Beroldingen with the inaugural National Guide Dog Change A Life Award, to inaugurate National Guide Dog Month in 2011, as a testament to Cecilia's courage and example of how having a guide dog has enabled her to remain independent.

It tells the story of a widow who shocks her upper-class, Anglo-American family when she announces that she has fallen in love with her Jewish doctor. His family is equally unhappy with the news, and both individuals have to fight the prejudices of their families. Plot Margaret Delafield, a rich elderly lady and widow of Spaulding 'Spud' Delafield (an unseen character),is rushed to hospital. She is not expected to survive, and her two sons and daughter gathering at her bedside are more concerned with their expected inheritance. Her doctor, Dr Marvin Elias, encourages her to fight. Margaret makes a full recovery and returns home to a welcome party for family and friends. Her sons Horton and Chipper and daughter Doreen are concerned that Margaret and Marvin seem to be spending more time together than might be expected for a doctor/patient relationship. They are devastated when Margaret and Marvin announce their impending wedding, and see their inheritance slipping away. They try to persuade her to change her mind, and Marvin's children are equally doubtful. Margaret's favourite church refuses to perform a mixed marriage (Marvin is Jewish) and Marvin's rabbi is equally unwilling. They decide on a small country church and invite all family and friends. The wedding is a mixture of Jewish and Christian symbolism, with a monastic chorus, harp music and medieval minstrels. The families are reconciled and the newlyweds leave for a honeymoon in Hawaii. The goings-on are observed by George, Margaret's neighbour and best friend, who breaks the fourth wall to comment on proceedings.

BIMx presents three dimensional building models in an interactive way similar to First-person shooter video games. Clients, consultants and builders can virtually walk through and make measurements in the 3D model without the need for installing ArchiCAD. The real-time cutaway function can help to discover the construction details of the displayed building model. 2D construction documentation can be accessed directly from the BIMx Hyper- model's 3D model views providing more detailed information about the building.  BIMx authoring and viewer applications  The Graphisoft BIMx software suite consists of three different applications: the desktop publisher software, the viewer apps for desktop and mobile and the web viewer application: * ArchiCAD (OS X / Windows): The BIM authoring tool, a commercial application, which can publish BIMx Hyper-models. * BIMx App (iOS / Android): A free app that can be downloaded from the iTunes App Store for displaying 3D models on iPad, iPhone or other Android-based smartphones or tablets. In-app purchase is also available at the free BIMx iOS app for buying PRO license to view hyper-models or a model-sharing license to share a specific model with any stakeholder. * BIMx PRO App (iOS): A commercial application that can be purchased from the iTunes App Store for displaying the entire BIMx Hyper- model: not only the 3D model of the building but also its two dimensional architectural documentation set as drawn and detailed with ARCHICAD. In-app purchase is available for buying a model-sharing license to share a specific model with any stakeholder. * BIMx Desktop Viewer (OS X / Windows): A desktop application that can be freely downloaded to view BIMx models. (3D models only, as the desktop viewer cannot display the drawing sheets.) * BIMx Web Viewer: A free web service to access BIMx Hyper-models in a browser without any installation. It is an integrated part of the GRAPHISOFT BIMx Model Transfer service. History The core engine of BIMx was originally developed by a Swedish developer: Zermatt Virtual Reality Software. The original product was released as an add-on for ArchiCAD 9. Graphisoft acquired Zermatt in 2010 and released Virtual Building Explorer for ArchiCAD 13 and ArchiCAD 14. Virtual Building Explorer for ArchiCAD 15 was renamed to BIMx or BIM Explorer.  BIMx Hyper-models  The BIMx Hyper-model concept provides easy access to drawing sheets (such as floor plans and sections) directly from the virtual environment generated from the 3D building models. The 2D drawing sheets of a BIMx Hyper-model can only be opened with either the paid BIMx PRO application or by an in-app purchase. There is also an in-app purchase available for sharing a Hyper-model with unlimited number of stakeholders.

It is located 45 km from Tirunelveli. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Vaishnava Nambi and his consort Lakshmi as Thirukurungudivalli.. The temple is locally referred as Dakshina Vaikuntam, the holy abode of Vishnu. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines and two of its three bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is tall. Vaishnava Nambi is believed to have appeared to slay the demon Somuka who abducted the four Vedas. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Six daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day annual Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May) and Brahmotsavam during the month of Chittirai, being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Image of the temple tower As per accounts in the Varaha Purana, a treatise of Varaha, an avatar of Vishnu, Varaha preferred to stay at this place with his consort Varahi in a small form and hence came to be known as Thirkurungudi (literally meaning a small house). As per a Hindu legend, Nambaduvan, a peasant and singer (locally called panan) from lower section of the society, was an ardent devotee of Vishnu. On account of his low life, he never entered the temple and worshipped from outside. While walking towards the temple one day, he was stopped by a demon. He sang the verses which he set for the presiding deity to him. He also assured the demon that he will come back from the temple when the demon can consume him. Nambi, the presiding deity was pleased by his devotion and appeared outside the temple. While returning, Nambi appeared as a Brahmin and tried to convince him to escape the demon. But Nambudavan was staunch and wanted to be true to his promise. The demon was pleased by the songs and said it did not want to consume him anymore. It is believed that the demon was a Brahmin who was cursed during his previous birth as he was not sincere doing his penance. He was relieved off his curse listening to the songs of Nambaduvan. Architecture Vaishnava Nambi temple is located in Thirukkurungudi, a village in Tirunelveli district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located from Tirunelveli and from Nanguneri. The temple has a flat entrance tower and a five-tiered gopuram (gateway tower). The temple has five prakarams, closed precincts of a temple and all the shrines are enclosed in the first two enclosures.Tourist Guide to South India .Various authors. Page 117. The temple occupies around . There are a number of halls, that have sculpted pillars from the Nayak period. There is a shrine to Shiva in the temple, which is an unusual feature in Vishnu temples. There is a festival hall in the second precinct in the temple facing South that has sculpted pillars indicating various Hindu legends. The most notable of them being a legend of Mahabharata where Bhima attacks a lion legged person with his club. The composite columns of Virabhadra holding sword and horn are found be additions of the Vijayanayagara kings during the early 1500s. Similar columns of Virabhadra are found in Adikesava Perumal Temple at Thiruvattaru, Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli, Kasi Viswanathar temple at Tenkasi, Krishnapuram Venkatachalapathy temple, Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram, Soundararajaperumal temple at Thadikombu, Srivilliputhur Andal temple, Srivaikuntanathan Permual temple at Srivaikuntam and Avudayarkovil. In Tamil language the word Nambi means personification of all virtuous and righteous qualities blended with beauty and grace. There are five Nambis in this Kshetram. They are Ninra Nambi (Standing posture), Irundha Nambi (Sitting posture), Kidandha Nambi (Sleeping posture), Thiruparkadal Nambi and Thirumalai Nambi. Thiruparkadal Nambi Temple is located near to the River Nambiyaru, one km from the main temple. Thirumalai Nambi Temple is on the hills (Mahendragiri Mountain) 8 km from the main temple. History Temple tower The temple has inscriptions from the 10th century during the Medieval Chola period indicating grants to the temple in the form of sheep. Another inscription from the 14th century is attributed to Sundara Pandya II indicating gifts of 25 cows for the perpetual lighting of ghee lamps in the temple. There are also inscriptions from the same regime indicating gift of lands to the temple. The Nayak period during the 15th century saw lot of additions to the temple complex in terms of pillared halls. The inscriptions on the southern wall of the hall dated 1059 indicates excavation of a channel with dams. There are similar inscriptions on the northern wall indicating repairs made to the same dam. There are two unreadable inscriptions on two pillars of the temple. There are three copper plate inscriptions in the temple dated 1456, 1537 and 1592 indicating grants from Sabala Veera Chandra Ramavarma Maharaja, Vittala Raya of Vijayanagar Empire and Vira Vasantha Venkatadeva Maharaja respectively indicating several grants to the temple. Religious significance Image of the temple priests carrying the image of festival deity The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Peyazhwar, Nammazhwar, Thirumangai Azhwar and Thirumalisai Alvar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. It is believed that Thirumangai Azhwar spent his last days in this place and attained Moksha. The place is thus referred as Dakshina Vaikuntam, the ultimate destination of Vaishnavites. A tradition of worshipping Vishnu through dance, music and art is called Kaisika Nataka is believed to have originated at Thirukkurungudi. A festival called Kaisika Ekadasi held at the temple every year. The local belief is that the devotees practising Kaisika Vratha or witnessing the performance would attain Moksha. Arayar Sevai, another form of worshipping Vishnu is also believed to have originated in this place. As per legend, the practise was established by Nathamuni, who was practising with his fellow mates and Vishnu was hiding in the South Mada street and enjoying the performance. Vishnu is also called as Gana Priyan, the one who enjoys music. It is believed that Ramanuja, the proponent of Vaishavadvaita philosophy taught Vishnu about Astakshara and hence the presiding deity came to be known as Vaishnava Nambi. Festival The Chittirai utsavam(festival) in the month of Chittirai (April - May), Vaikasi Jestabishekam during June, Aavani Pavithrotsavam during Aavani (August - September), Float festival during Thai (January - February) and Brahmostavam during March–April are the major festivals in the temple. The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Vaikanasa aagama. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Ardha Jamam at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Vaishnava Nambi and Thirukurungaivalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.

Military service =Early service= Peacock served first in the Coldstream Guards, leaving the Army after six years' service. After a few years, he rejoined the Army in 1936, this time in the Green Howards (1st Battalion at Portland). He was stationed in Palestine, where he distinguished himself as a lance-corporal in December 1938 when his unit was attacked on the road between Nablus and Tulkarm. His section was ambushed at close range with rifle fire, but Peacock largely suppressed the attack with well-placed fire from his Bren gun, despite a wound to his head. For his coolness and bravery in action, he was awarded the Military Medal, which was presented by the Princess Royal during a parade at Catterick to mark the Green Howards' 250th anniversary. =World War II= After the German attack on Norway in April 1940, Peacock, now a sergeant, was sent to Norway with his unit. He distinguished himself in a fighting retreat against the invading forces at Otta in Gudbrandsdalen on 28 April 1940, in circumstances which emphasised his courage, bravery and service readiness. For this action, Peacock was awarded the War Cross with Sword by the Norwegian Minister in London on 20 March 1942. After Norway, Peacock's war service took place around the world. In the war's last days Peacock again distinguished himself again in battle at Büchen in Schleswig-Holstein on 1 May 1945, about 45 km east of Hamburg. During this action against effective German resistance, Company Sergeant Major Peacock’s company took heavy casualties, including all the officers except an inexperienced 2nd lieutenant and Peacock was left in effective charge. He personally led the attack on Buchen, including an attack on an enemy machine-gun post, and arranged the evacuation of casualties despite heavy and accurate enemy fire. Peacock's assessment and leadership helped to ensure the attack's success and he was rewarded for his part with the Distinguished Conduct Medal. =After World War II= After the war he served in Malaya, Cyprus and Hong Kong. On his return from Malaya, he became Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) of the Depot at Richmond and during the following three years in this post, he gained a position of great respect. In 1954, he requested a posting as RSM of the 2nd Battalion in Cyprus. The two battalions were subsequently merged and Peacock became 1st Battalion's RSM and went with them to Hong Kong. Illness necessitated Peacock's return to England in December 1956, and after a lengthy treatment he became RSM of HQ Northern Command at York on the Long Service List. Peacock's last duty with his Regiment was to take part with the representative party at the funeral of the Norwegian King Haakon in October 1957. Retirement and death Clarence Peacock died in Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital Millbank on Tuesday 8 April 1958. His coffin was carried by eight Warrant Officers of the Green Howards and he was buried in Richmond with full military honours. The esteem in which he was widely held is indicated by the large number of military and civilian attendees at his funeral and the display of his medals at the Regimental Museum in Richmond.

Constructed in the Kerala style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, by Nammalwar, one of the saint poets of the 8th century. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, who is worshipped as Imayavarappan. The nearest railway station to the temple is located in Chengannur, while the nearest airports are Trivandrum International Airport and Nedupumpassery Airport Ernakulam. It is one of the five ancient shrines in the Chengannur area of Kerala, connected with the legend of Mahabharata, where the five Pandavas are believed to have built one temple each; Thrichittatt Maha Vishnu Temple by Yudhishthira, Puliyur Mahavishnu Temple by Bheema, Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple by Arjuna, Thiruvanvandoor Mahavishnu Temple by Nakula and Thrikodithanam Mahavishnu Temple by Sahadeva. The temple is open from 5:00 am to 11:00 am and 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm and is administered by Travancore Devaswom Board of the Government of Kerala. Legend thumb It is one of the five ancient shrines in the Chengannur area of Kerala, connected with the legend of Mahabharata. Legend has it that the Pandava princes, after crowning Parikshit as king of Hastinapura left on a pilgrimage. On arriving on the banks of river Pamba, each one is believed to have installed a tutelary image of Krishna; Thrichittatt Maha Vishnu Temple by Yudhishthira, Puliyur Mahavishnu Temple by Bheema, Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple by Arjuna, Thiruvanvandoor Mahavishnu Temple by Nakula and Thrikodithanam Mahavishnu Temple by Sahadeva.Cultural Heritage of Kerala 2008, pp. 44-45Rao 2012, pp. 17-20 During Mahabharata war, Yudhishthira, the head of the Pandavas, who never before uttered a lie, lied in one instant to defeat his Guru, Dronacharya. To overcome the sin of the lie, he underwent penance worshiping the lord here. Imayavar (Devas) came to this place prior to Yudhishthira and hence the deity here is referred as Imayavarappar. There is another version that the Pandavas worshipped the idols during the reign and started installing them in different places during the end of the reign. Thiruchittattu temple, is considered to be one among the 108 most sacred place of worship, where Lord Vishnu himself resides. The Temple is believed to have been built by Devas along the banks of Chittar, a tributary of Holy River Pampa, before mankind was born. The temple, was then renovated, by Yudhishthira in Dvapara Yuga. The temple is considered to be the primary temple among the five Mahavishnu Temples built by Pandavas. It is believed that long before Yudhishthira renovated the temple, the Devas undertook pilgrimages to this spot many a time for the purpose of making special prayers and requests to the Lord to bless them so that they can ensure that the objective of harmony between the three world is fulfilled After their prayers Lord Vishnu, presented himself to bless the Devas and also for them to get a glimpse of the Lord, filling the devotees with a sense of joy and wiping of their sorrows In Dvapara Yuga, the Pandavas resided at present day Chengannur for a large duration of their exile, hence, after the passing of Lord Krishna, Sage Brighu persuaded the Pandavas to consecrate four sacred temples in the vicinity, to the Lord, who was their guide and protector in Mahabharata This, would allow daily offerings and pooja to be carried out on the benevolent Lord, in the form of the Thevaram, not only by Pandavas but also all the people who helped Pandavas survive during the exile. The Pandavas, maintained and performed Pooja in the five temples till their Swargarohanam (Auspicious journey to Vaikuntam) Yudhishthira on renovation of the temple, installed the Thevara Moorthy of Lord Vishnu with a tutelary image of Lord Krishna. This unique idol, is facing east in a standing posture, with four arms, holding the - Shankh (Conch) in the upper right hand, Sudharshana Chakra (Discus) in the upper left hand, Lotus in the lower right hand. The lower left hand is free, however Lord Vishnu idols generally have a Gada (Mace) in this hand. Yudhishthira after having a holy bath, installed the idols after immersing it in the Pushkarani (Pond), filling the Conch with its water and performed the first Pooja after installation Hence, the pond at Thrichittat is named as - Amurtha Pushkarani, since the idol was immersed in it and as - Shankh Theertham, on the occasion of the pond's water filling the Conch, therefore, worshipping at Shankh Theertham, is considered equivalent to that of Sree Kovil (Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple), and full darshanam is complete when both places are worshipped History Earliest references to this temple appear in the poems and hymns composed by the greatest of Alvar saints - Nammalvar, in circa 800 AD. Stone inscriptions in the temple date it back to the Second Chera Empire (800 - 1102 AD).Temples of Kerala.

He worshipped this sthalaperumal, Maayapiraan. Sapta Rishis - Atthri, Vasishtar, Kaasyapar, Gouthamar, Bharadwajar, Vishvamitra and Jamadagni got the seva of this Maayapiraan along with porkodi Naachiyaar and through Indra, it is said that all these Saptarishis got their Mukti towards the Emperumaan.http://www.divyadesam.com/hindu/temples/kerala/tirupuliyoor- temple.shtml Once, Virukshadharbi, who was the son of Sibhi Chakravarthy, ruled an empire where there was flood and there was no proper vegetation and the wealth and the beauty of the entire empire seems to be decreasing. At that time, the king thought, if any austerities were given to Sapta Rishis, it might increase the wealth and beauty of the Empire. As a result of this, he invited Saptarishis, the seven important sages. But, the Saptarishis did not accept his charity, since they felt that the reduction of wealth and health in the entire empire were on account of the deeds of the ruling king. But, the king wanted them to accept his donation, and as a result of this, he asked his palace officials to keep some gold inside the fruits and give them that, so that they would accept that and simultaneously his charity is also accepted. But, knowing the truth that some golds are placed inside the fruit through their yogic power, the sages did not accept the fruits also. Virukshadharbi got angry with the Saptharishis and tried them to kill and as a result of this cruel mind, he started an Yaagam in which a lady Pishacha by named \\"Kiruthyai\\" arose and he ordered the demon to kill all them. Knowing this, Emperumaan sent Indra to destroy Kiruthyai and to protect the sages. Indra killed the demon and all the Sapta Rishis got the seva of the Emperumaan and got their Mukthi.

After high school, however, he relocated to Los Angeles and soon discovered the world of funk and jazz. After several years touring throughout the U.S. with various show groups, R&B; revues and big hands, including the Harry James Big Band, he returned to Los Angeles to further his career. Harry Kim at the National Trumpet Competition in 2014 Latin music took a front seat during the disco era, a time when live music was rarely featured in discothèques but was in strong demand by salsa audiences. It was at this time that he began working with artists such as Tito Puente and Celia Cruz, and also began honing his arranging skills by writing and performing on many disco productions. Soon he joined Stevie Wonder's Wonder Love, which opened the doors of opportunity to perform and record with such artists as Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, The Four Tops, The Temptations, and Smokey Robinson. He was on stage for the Emmy Award-winning 25th Anniversary of Motown, performing with many of Motown's greatest stars. It was an evening highlighted by Michael Jackson's introduction of his now legendary moonwalk. In 1985 he joined the Phenix Horns, the celebrated horn section of Earth, Wind and Fire. Together they performed with various artists throughout the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Included were two tours in 1987 and 1988 with French icon Michel Berger and vocalist France Gall. In 1989 Kim participated in the making of Phil Collins's multi- award-winning CD ...But Seriously. A world tour followed in 1990, marking the beginning of a long association with Collins. The multi-platinum live concert CD Serious Hits Live was released soon after. Realizing the many advantages of being part of a high-performance horn section, Kim founded The Vine Street Horns. He called together musicians with whom he had worked for many years. Numerous productions with various artists were to follow. In 1994 Phil Collins called on The Vine Street Horns to join him on his Both Sides Tour, an extensive 18-month world tour. In 1996 he was asked by Collins to organize a big band featuring adaptations of his music and the music of Genesis in a jazz setting. The Phil Collins Big Band was born. As musical director and arranger, Kim and The Vine Street Horns took center stage performing at all the major European jazz festivals, with Tony Bennett as vocalist and Quincy Jones as guest conductor. This was also the year they recorded Phil Collins' Into The Light CD, which toured the world in 1997. The year 1998 saw another Phil Collins Big Band tour resulting in a live CD entitled A Hot Night in Paris. Later that year an introduction to France's legendary singer Johnny Hallyday led to three sold-out performances at the Stade de France (seating 81,338 people), five successful tours from 1998 to 2009 and numerous top-selling concert CDs and DVDs. In the new millennium Kim continues to enjoy a well- balanced schedule of studio recordings and live performances. Although he continues to tour throughout the world, with Johnny Hallyday and Phil Collins,Windplayer, 2001 he also manages to add to his long list of credits while at home. Recently he has acted as horn section leader and arranger for the 2005–2009 seasons of American Idol as well as for America's Got Talent and Celebrity Duets.

The most important influences on his thought were Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche,Gerald Alvoet, Nietzsche et l'Europe: \\"Nous autres, bons Européens\\", ed. L'Harmattan, 2006, , \\\\- Bellefroid et al, Joaquim Vital - esquisses pour un portrait, éditions de la Différence, 2011, , Heidegger and Michel Foucault.Politique de théâtre, morale sartrienne et gracieuse dialectique, Nous autres Européens, op.cit. Paquet rejected all forms of Idealism in favor of the sensory world. Insofar as he considered human beings to be no more than fragments of nature, thought was considered by him to be the result of cerebral processes which operate largely beneath the level of consciousness. He insisted on the pre-eminence of the body and the fact that, for this reasons, consciousness observes the results of thought, but does not bring them into being. Inspired by Nietzsche's notion of Eternal Recurrence - which Paquet treated not as a doctrine but an operational principle, that is as a means of disentangling ourselves from secondary aspects of our identity (determined by cultural, religious and moral factors) in order to recover our primary nature - he considered a return to the body as the sole ethical value.Platon, l’éternel retour de la liberté, op.cit. He developed this Spinozan theme in a number of different directions: ontology (L'enjeu de la philosophie, Platon: l’éternel retour de la liberté), political philosophy (Nous autres Européens, Le Fascisme Blanc) and esthetics, the latter in particular in relation to painting which he defined as the art of rendering the sensory visible.Rouge Absolu, op.cit. He is the author of a large number of essays consecrated to visual artists whom he knew personally: Jean Dubuffet, Alexander Calder, André Masson, René Magritte, Paul Delvaux, Fernando Botero, Sophia Vari, Corneille (one of the six founders of the Cobra movement), Bram Bogart, Anna Wilczynska- Wilska, Amann. He is also the author of several philosophical novels, namely Renaissance sécondaire, Merde à Jésus, L’affaire Socrate and Marie et les Jean. He died in Poznań, Poland, on 22 November 2014. \\\\- Colette Lambriche, \\"LETTRE DÉCEMBRE 2014 - IN MEMORIAM MARCEL PAQUET\\", La lettre des Éditions de La Différence, December 2014  Life  Paquet was born in Jumet, near Charleroi. According to his own account, he had an unhappy childhood. He sought refuge in books, and in particular in Spinoza's Ethics and in Nietzsche's Antichrist. A school trip to London allowed him to discover the works of William Turner; later a visit to Amsterdam gave rise to his passion for the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh as well as allowing him to meet the situationist painter and architect Constant, whose work Het Opstand van de Homo ludens (\\"The uprising of Homo Ludens\\") he translated into French. He matriculated at the Free University of Brussels in 1964 and in 1967 became assistant to Professor Pierre Verstraeten. His graduation dissertation dealt with the problem of unity in Kant's thought in the Critique of Judgment (L’unité problématique du kantisme dans la Critique de la force de juger). In 1971, he became a junior associate (\\"aspirant\\") at the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research. He did research into fanaticism and published a number of articles including \\"Essai sur l’absolu\\" (Essay on the concept of the Absolute) which brought him to the attention of French philosopher Gérard LebrunG. Lebrun, L'envers de la dialectique - Hegel à la lumière de Nietzsche, éd. du Seuil, Paris, 2004, and led to a professorship in the history of German Philosophy at the University of Tunis. It was during his period in Tunis, which lasted from 1972 to 1974, that he wrote his first published work L’enjeu de la philosophie (\\"The Question of Philosophy\\") and he began work on his doctoral dissertation on \\"The difference between the thought of Kant and Hegel on the question of the essence of art\\" (La différence des pensées de Kant et de Hegel dans la question de l’essence de l’art.Botero, Essai d’analyse philosophique, op.cit., ff. In 1975, he was one of the founders of the publishing house Les Éditions de la Différence. In 1978, he obtained his doctorate and continued to work on issues related to painting (René Magritte,Clara Elizabeth Orban, ed., The Culture of Fragments: Word and Images in Futurism and Surrealism, Ed. Rodopi, Amsterdam, 1997, , Paul Delvaux, Fernando Botero). In 1981, he took part, together with Hans-Georg Gadamer in the colloquium \\"1881: The great year of Zarathustra\\" organised at the Brock University of Saint-Catharines in Canada:M. Paquet, \\"Nietzsche et l’art moderne\\", in The great year of Zarathoustra (1881-1981) ; edited by David Goicoechea, University press of America, 1983. he made a presentation of his concept of \\"dansité\\", a play on words which suggests both \\"innerness\\" and dance, which was later incorporated into his book Magritte ou l’éclipse de l’être.op.cit. He subsequently took up residence in Canada, where he lived in Ontario and for a time in Quebec. In 1988, he taught French literature at the University of Udine in Italy. Upon his return to Belgium, he made the acquaintance of Bram Bogart \\\\- in relation to whom he wrote a number of articles. In Paris in 1990 he met a number of artists of the \\"New New Painting\\" group and developed a theoretical account of their artistic approach, set out in a work published by the publishing house Nouvelles éditions françaises.New New Painting, Nouvelles éditions françaises, Paris, 1992 In 1993, he created the \\"École européenne de philosophie de Charleroi\\".

Geography The Navesink Highlands, which stretch west to east along the south shore of Raritan Bay (part of New York Bay), lie entirely within the boundaries of Monmouth County. A thin barrier spit known as Sandy Hook fronts the ocean side of the Navesink Highlands, separated from the base of the most seaward hills by the narrow tidal channel of the Shrewsbury River. The western portions of the Highlands, which attain the highest elevations of the range, are sometimes referred to as the Mount Pleasant Hills.Topoquest (Map Center: N40.39759, W74.15828; overview of central-western Navesink Highlands including the Mount Pleasant Hills). Topoquest.com, 2008-2010. Retrieved 2011-09-05. The hills of this area include Beacon Hill, Telegraph Hill, and Crawford Hill. Beacon Hill is often referred to as the tallest \\"peak\\" in the range, however it only obtains an elevation of 373 feet. (USGS topographic map Marlboro, NJ shows a benchmark at the approximate summit of Beacon Hill with an elevation of 364 feet.)Topoquest (Map Center: N40.37366, W74.22795; Beacon Hill). Topoquest.com, 2008-2012. Retrieved 2013-05-29. The actual tallest summit is Crawford Hill, followed by Telegraph Hill. This is evident by Bell Labs (now AT&T;) building their famous Holmdel Horn Antenna on the summit of Crawford Hill, while the Army picked Telegraph Hill for a main Nike missile control center, and missile silo. The Mount Pleasant area, generally comprising portions of Holmdel and Marlboro with elevations over 300 feet, induces a slight micro climate. In the winter, it is possible for the Mount Pleasant region to receive more snow than lower elevation areas. This is due to lapse rate which shows that temperature drops on average 3.5 - 5 degrees for every 1000 feet of elevation. Due to the influence of the ocean in the winter, the hills often receive snow at 31 degrees while lower elevations receive mixed precipitation or rain. Geology The hills of the Navesink Highlands are composed of uplifted layers of hardened sands, mud, and gravel from the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The uplift of the Highlands is attributed to glacial rebound, although it is possible that other geologic processes are occurring. The current height of the hills is partly a consequence of their structure. The topmost geologic layer of the Highlands, the Cohansey Formation, is composed of sand, gravel, and erosion resistant ironstone. This layer forms a hard capstone along the highest summits of the Highlands, protecting more easily weathered underlying geologic layers such as the Navesink Formation. Recreation The Navesink Highlands offer a variety of recreational and educational opportunities to the region. These include hiking, fishing, historical venues, and even fossil collecting. Holmdel Park contains several hills in the Mt. Pleasant portion of the range, and is nationally known for its difficult cross country courses.

C. B. J. Hall, also known as Bohemian Hall or Zapadni Cesko Bratrske Jednota Hall, is an historic building located near Arthur, Wisconsin that was built in 1907. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 25, 1992. It historically served as a meeting hall for the Czech community. In 1896, after most pine was logged off in the town of Arthur, the Cypreanson Brothers of Eau Claire offered cut-over land for sale and hired Vincent Benish to advertise that land in Czech-language newspapers to immigrants in southwest Wisconsin. Many of these people had left their homeland unhappy with Habsburg rule and its links to the Catholic Church. As a result, many were skeptical of the church and open to Marxist ideas and the Freethought movement. Still, they needed funerals and weddings, and a way to socialize with their fellow Czechs. In 1904 the Arthur Czech community organized a chapter of the Zapadni Ceska Bratrska Jednota - Western Bohemian Fraternal Association. In 1907 the members built their hall. The original section was 60 feet by 32 feet with a false-front parapet. In 1913 a foldable stage was added for performances by the \\"Goodwill Actors,\\" who traveled around the state, presenting several Czech plays each year. In 1930 a stage and rear kitchen were added to the back of the building. The exterior is sided with metal embossed to look like cement blocks and painted silver. The hall hosted the weddings and funerals mentioned before, and also all-night dances and fraternal meetings. The organization lent money and provided insurance.

It entered service as the C-69 military transport aircraft during World War II for the United States Army Air Forces and was the first civilian version after the war. When production ended in 1946 it was replaced by the improved L-649 and L-749 Constellation.  History  =Design and development= In June 1939, Howard Hughes, the owner of Transcontinental & Western Air (later called Trans World Airlines and abbreviated TWA for short), prepared a meeting at his Hancock Park residence in California. Jack Frye (then president of TWA) attended along with three executives from the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation which included designer Clarence \\"Kelly\\" Johnson. During the meeting Hughes expressed his concerns for what he called the \\"airliner of the future\\". Lockheed's airliner under development at the time, the L-044 Excalibur, did not meet the requirements. When the meeting ended with Hughes and Frye, the executives immediately started on improving the Excalibur to meet Hughes' expectations. One idea was to use the Wright R-2600 radials in place of the proposed Wright GR-1820 radials. It was decided instead to start from scratch using some original characteristics of the Excalibur. The design was lengthened from 74 ft 3 in to 95 ft 9 in and the wingspan was increased to 102 ft 4 in. Six different layouts of the cockpit envisaged, including a \\"Bug-Eye\\" proposal in which the pilot and co-pilot would sit in separate domes next to each other. In the end, it was decided to use a single curvature design with all-around glazing. Three weeks later, the new design was presented in a different meeting. The design was given the designation L-049 or Excalibur A. The wings of the aircraft were similar to those used by the P-38 Lightning fighter. The aircraft was to be powered by four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radials with the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 as the back-up. Re-designed, the Excalibur was to be priced at $450,000, making it the most expensive airliner on the drawing board. Since TWA was unable to provide funding, Howard Hughes had his other company, the Hughes Tool Company, fund the construction of the airliner. Hughes ordered 40 Excaliburs on July 10, 1940, making the order the largest in airline history at the time. The development was to be kept a secret until the 35th aircraft was delivered to TWA. This was done in order to keep competitors such as Juan Trippe's Pan American World Airways from ordering the aircraft and competing with TWA. The secret was apparently well kept. When Hughes was brought in to look at a scale mock up of the Excalibur's cabin, he was not pleased with the outcome and stated \\"It's not what I expected\\". Hughes later had Raymond Loewy redesign the cabin to his liking. A complete life sized mock up of the Excalibur was eventually constructed with battery operated retractable landing gear. The gear mechanisms were tested on the mock up for design validation before production began. The powerplant itself was tested on a PV-1 Ventura which was nicknamed \\"Vent-ellation\\" for the occasion. The name \\"Excalibur\\" was later dropped as the new aircraft had nothing in common with the original L-044 design. The name \\"Constellation\\" was picked up as an unofficial nickname until the intervention of the military. The Constellation had several technological advancements such as electric de-icing, hydraulic assisted controls, reversible pitch propellers and pressurization, which allowed the Constellation to fly above the clouds. Lockheed had done pressurization in an aircraft before, with the Lockheed XC-35.Breffort, Dominique. Lockheed Constellation: from Excalibur to Starliner Civilian and Military Variants. Histoire and Collecions, 2006, pp. 6–23.California Classic Propliners – Lockheed Constellations; Gibson, Tom; Retrieved 9/5/11L1049 Super Constellation – Lockheed Constellation Survivors; Petersen, Ralph M.; Retrieved 9/5/11 =World War II and further development= A few months before the United States entered World War II, the Wartime Production Board inspected Lockheed's Burbank facility which housed the Constellation prototype. The long kept secret could no longer be held on to, and Lockheed announced the existence of the Constellation to the world. Even so, the secret of the Constellation's development remains one of the best kept industrial secrets to this day. Juan Trippe took advantage of this situation and ordered 22 L-049 Constellations and 18 L-149 Constellations (a model with a larger fuel capacity). KLM jumped in and ordered four examples. However, production couldn't begin right away, due to bombers and fighters destined for Great Britain overtaking the assembly lines at Lockheed. After cancellation of the XB-30 (a bomber version of the Constellation) in 1941, military officials gave Lockheed the go-ahead to build 80 Constellations (on the condition that other aircraft on their assembly lines would not be affected). With this, Lockheed could now put all attention towards building the Constellation airliner. The prototype XC-69 circa 1943. On December 7, 1941, Japanese forces launched a surprise attack on the US Naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, causing the United States to enter the war. This meant that Lockheed's production lines were now under control by the military for the war effort. In March 1942, the 80 L-049 Constellations planned for airline use were requisitioned by the Air Transport Command, and given the military designation C-69. In December 1942, the XC-69 prototype was rolled out. This was the first four engined aircraft to be produced by Lockheed. Several ground tests were performed on the XC-69 that same month. The final inspections were taken out on the XC-69 in January 1943, and the aircraft first flew on January 9 with Edmund Allen (Boeing's chief test pilot who was borrowed for the occasion) at the controls. When the flight ended, Allen stated \\"This machine works so well that you don't need me anymore!\\". With that, Allen returned to Boeing. On April 17, 1944, the second production C-69 was flown by Howard Hughes and Jack Frye, President TWA TWA \\"History\\" by TWA also I am in possession of a document (Postmarked Postal Cover celebrating this flight and hand signed by both Jack Frye & Howard Hughes) on a flight between Burbank and Washington DC that took little less than seven hours. The aircraft was painted in full TWA livery for the occasion. Famous actress Ava Gardner was on board the aircraft at this time. The Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone was the troubled powerplant of the Constellation and caused delays in the development of the aircraft. Due to problems with the Constellation's powerplant, the R-3350, the aircraft were grounded on February 1943. Flight testing resumed in June 1943. Problems with the R-3350 however, continued and production of the R-3350 was halted until the problems with the engines could be solved. This slowed down the development of the Constellation. Further setbacks occurred, including the B-29 Superfortress gaining priority for the R-3350 powerplants, for which the powerplant had been originally developed. The Douglas C-54 Skymaster was also further in development than the Constellation. Also, the end of the war in the Pacific was now in sight. The 260 C-69 aircraft were first reduced to 73 then all together cancelled. Only 22 C-69s were ever constructed for the United States Army Air Forces and only 15 were delivered. =Postwar service= As World War II drew to a close, large quantities of military surplus became available on the civilian market along with the cancellation of the remaining C-69 Constellations still in production. With the Constellation's design at risk, Lockheed purchased the five remaining C-69 transports still in production back from the military, saving 15,000 jobs. The five aircraft were re-converted into L-049 civilian airliners and put up for sale on the market. These modifications included removal of the retractable tail stand; along with the inclusion of a luxury interior, more portholes, a galley, and crew relief areas. Better ventilation, insulation and heating were also added. The powerplants were replaced by R-3350-745C18BA-1 engines (the civilian equivalent to the wartime R-3350-35). Design tests did not need to be conducted, as Lockheed had already tasked them to the C-69 aircraft during the war (one of the C-69s also completed the trials for the civilian airworthiness certificate on December 11, 1945). This made the development of L-049 months ahead of the competing Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, Douglas DC-6 and Republic RC-2 Rainbow (which was still on the drawing board). 89 aircraft had been ordered by November 1945. The L-049 was used by TWA, Delta Airlines, Capital Airlines, Braniff, Pan American World Airways, American Overseas Airlines (AOA), Pan American-Grace Airways (Panagra), Air France, KLM, BOAC, El Al, Cubana de Aviación, and other less-known airlines. A Pan American World Airways L-049 Constellation at London Heathrow International Airport. Trans European Airways. The first production L-049 flew on July 12, 1945 and was delivered to TWA on November 14, 1945. Pan Am received its first L-049 on January 5, 1946. Due to clauses imposed on Lockheed by Howard Hughes, American Airlines and United Airlines went instead to Douglas and ordered the competing DC-6 (AOA, the overseas subsidiary of American Airlines, still purchased the L-049). The first commercial flight of the L-049 occurred on February 5, 1946 with TWA's \\"Star of Paris\\" flying from New York City to Paris. The flight lasted nearly 17 hours, stopping over in both Ireland and Newfoundland. On January 14, 1946, Pan Am began flying its L-049 equipment between Bermuda and New York, replacing the slower Boeing 314 Clipper that flew before it. AOA, BOAC, and Air France all started L-049 operations later that year. Due to requests by the airlines, production ceased in 1946, in favor of a more standard civilian Constellation, which became the L-649 and L-749 respectively. On the evening of June 18, 1947, the Lockheed L-049 Constellation serving Pan Am Flight 121, known as the Clipper Eclipse and crewed by third officer Gene Roddenberry (who went on to create the original Star Trek television series), suffered an engine failure which led to the overheating of the remaining engines until one caught fire, which spread to the aircraft. When an engine fell from the aircraft, it was unable to maintain altitude, resulting in a crash in the Syrian desert 4 miles (6.4 km) from the town of Mayadin in the early morning of June 19, 1947 and the death of fifteen people.

Though advanced for its time, it failed to gain a production order and only one was built. Design and development Like the Bernard SIMB AB 10, the AB 12 was an all-metal, single-seat, monoplane fighter with a low cantilever wing. It differed from the AB10 in having a radial engine, a more conventional undercarriage and four machine guns. The wing plans of both aircraft were similar, straight tapered with squared tips, though the AB 12 had a span greater. The empennage of both designs was also similar: the AB 12 had a tailplane with swept leading edges and separate elevators mounted on top of the fuselage and a wide chord, almost straight edged fin, though its rudder, moving between the elevators, ended on the upper fuselage line. The fuselage had an oval cross section with the open cockpit over the wing, a short, faired headrest behind it. The AB 12 was powered by a Gnome-Rhône 9Ab radial, a licence-built Bristol Jupiter. By the standards of the day this was quite well cowled-in for a radial but the cylinder heads protruded for cooling. The details of the gun mounting are not clear, but images show at least one on the starboard side firing through a slot in the nose just above mid-height, the opening extending between two cylinders. The undercarriage of the AB 12 was quite conventional and very different from that of the AB 10. It had a pair of single mainwheels mounted on a single, faired axle, with V-form legs attached to the lower fuselage. The tricycle gear was completed by a tailskid. Overall, the AB 12 was 40% more powerful but less aerodynamically clean and 7% heavier than the AB 10, so its maximum speed was only 6% higher. Monoplanes in a biplane era, neither design received a production order and only one of each was built.

It was also included on the compilation album Lennon. Lyrics and music Like some other songs on Double Fantasy, including the hit single \\"(Just Like) Starting Over,\\" one of the themes of \\"Cleanup Time\\" is rebirth, and another theme, as with \\"Watching the Wheels\\" is Lennon \\"coming to terms with his quiet years.\\" Lennon wrote the song in Bermuda in June 1980. It was inspired by a phone discussion Lennon had with Jack Douglas, who would become the producer of Double Fantasy, while Lennon was staying in Bermuda. The two discussed the 1970s and how people were cleaning up their alcohol and drug habits, and the conversation ended with Douglas stating that \\"Well, it's cleanup time, right\\" and Lennon responding \\"It sure is.\\" Lennon was then inspired to start playing a boogie on the piano, and wrote \\"Cleanup Time\\" in the process. Lennon has described the song as \\"a piano lick, with the words added.\\" After developing the piano lick and having the title, Lennon wrote the words around a conception of the Lennon's home, The Dakota, being metaphorically their Palace of Versailles. Although Lennon claimed that the lyrics apply to people in general, and not specifically to the Lennons, the song does reflect the reality of the Lennons cleaning up their diets and their finances, as well as their drug habits, and reports on what the previous five years away from recording meant to the Lennons. The song, like Lennon's Beatles' song \\"Cry Baby Cry,\\" incorporates elements of the nursery rhyme \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence.\\" In the case of \\"Cleanup Time,\\" the references to the king being in the kitchen and the queen counting the money may be autobiographical references. Lennon had become a househusband while Ono was taking care of the couple's finances. The song explicitly references that the king is baking bread, and Lennon was particularly proud of baking bread himself. The lyrics also reflect Lennon's happiness being at home and being free of many obligations, such as recording contracts. According to author Andrew Jackson, \\"Cleanup Time\\" and \\"Woman\\" represent \\"the happy ending fade out of a bohemian It's a Wonderful Life,\\" as the troubled young Lennon had found peace as a father and husband. Tim Riley remarks that the song works on two levels: \\"a playfully gentle gibe at household chores\\" and as \\"an adult song about addiction.\\" Recording \\"Cleanup Time\\" began recording at the Hit Factory in New York City on 13 August 1980. Horn overdubs were added on 5 September and Lennon's vocal was recorded on 17 September. Mixing was completed by Yoko Ono on 18 October. It was the last song from Double Fantasy to be completed. Reception Pop historian Robert Rodriguez considers \\"Cleanup Time\\" one of the weakest songs on Double Fantasy, claiming that it sounds like Lennon is \\"trying too damn hard to sell us something.\\" Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish claim it has a sound reminiscent of the soul music issued by Stax Records and Atlantic Records during the mid-60s, particularly noting the horn parts. Personnel The musicians who performed on the original recording were as follows: *John Lennon – vocals, rhythm guitar *Earl Slick, Hugh McCracken – lead guitar *Tony Levin – bass *George Small – keyboards *Howard Johnson, Grant Hunderford, J.D Parran, Seldon Powell, George 'Young' Opalisky, Roger Rosenberg, David Tofani, Ronald Tooley – horns *Andy Newmark – drums *Arthur Jenkins – percussion References External links * Category:John Lennon songs Category:Songs written by John Lennon Category:1980 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jack Douglas (record producer) Category:Song recordings produced by John Lennon Category:Song recordings produced by Yoko Ono ","title":"Cleanup Time"},{"id":"32991926","text":"Saylesville is an unincorporated community located in the town of Genesee, Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States.

He became well known to the United States' public after he stood next to President George W. Bush as the president gave a speech at the ruins of the World Trade Center after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Photos of Beckwith and the president appeared on the front page of the New York Daily News and the cover of Time magazine. This exposure launched him into the national spotlight and led to press attention and interviews. Beckwith has met several times with President Bush since then, spoken extensively in public, and acted as a fundraiser for charities. Personal life Beckwith has lived for more than 50 years with his wife Barbara in the same house in Baldwin, Nassau County, New York. The couple has six adult children. Career Beckwith is a veteran of the New York City Fire Department with 30 years of service. =Actions at Ground Zero= U.S. President George W. Bush speaking at Ground Zero with Beckwith beside him On the morning of September 11, 2001, Beckwith was tending to his grandson, who had been hit by a car while biking to school. Before he arrived at the hospital with his grandson, Beckwith was aware that a plane had struck the World Trade Center. When the boy appeared to be in stable condition, Beckwith left the hospital and went to World Trade Center site after he saw the South Tower collapse via television. Even though he had been retired for seven years from the New York City Fire Department, he grabbed his old gear and bluffed his way past the blockades and barricades that had been set up and began helping with bucket brigades and missing person searches. President George W. Bush speaking at Ground Zero with Beckwith beside him On September 14, after Beckwith and some men had unearthed a fire engine buried in rubble from the fallen buildings, they tested its stability as a stand from which to speak, and a Secret Service agent ordered him to help President Bush onto the platform. Beckwith handed Bush a bullhorn with which to address the crowd of responders and workers and was told to climb down by the Secret Service and Karl Rove, but Bush insisted that Beckwith stay with him. An image of Bush with Beckwith was featured the next day on the front page of the New York Daily News. =National fame and activities since 9/11= A photo of Bush with Beckwith standing together was published two weeks later on the cover of Time magazine, catapulting Beckwith to the national spotlight. Rejecting his new- found fame, he initially refused to speak to various news personalities and shows—Diane Sawyer, the Today Show, and Rosie O'Donnell—though he eventually appeared on MSNBC and other news channels and programs. Beckwith continues to be bashful about his fame, though an enlarged version of the Time magazine cover that made him famous hangs in his den. Regarding the cover, Beckwith said that \\"[a]ll these guys that come over to interview me, they all have to have a picture of it.\\" Beckwith also has a first edition print of the cover, which is encased in a display box together with a flag that waved at Ground Zero, given to him by President Bush. Beckwith has volunteered to have the items in his possession go to the 9/11 Memorial after he dies. He has already donated the clothes and helmet that he was wearing that day to the memorial. Beckwith has visited 11 times with President Bush, traveled and spoken extensively, and dedicated much of his activity to fundraising for the New York Firefighters Burn Center Foundation. On February 25, 2002, in a White House ceremony together with Governor George Pataki of New York state, Beckwith presented to Bush the bullhorn the president had used to address workers at the World Trade Center site just days after the attacks. In the wake of the killing of Osama bin Laden by a team of U.S. Navy SEALs, Beckwith was asked his opinion. He stated: \\"I would have liked it to be on George Bush's watch, but it wasn't, so OK\\".

The work is known to have been commissioned by the Medici family in Florence, as testified by the Florentine coat of arms with a red lily at the center of the lower step. The work has been variously dated from 1450–1451, when the artist travelled to Rome visiting several Italian courts, or from 1460–1464, the same years of the Lamentation of Christ, inspired by Beato Angelico and now at the Uffizi. Description Above a gold background, van der Weyden painted a baldachin lined with precious damask cloth, under which are the Virgin with Child, St. Peter, St. John the Baptist (patron saint of Florence), St. Cosmas (a protector of the House of Medici), and St. Damian. Cosmas is portrayed while putting a coin in a handbag hanging from his belt, a reference of his legend, according to which he had accepted a small sum for a medical performance, causing rage in his brother Damian. In the foreground is a still life with the artist's typical attention to natural details. In the centre is a gilt metallic amphora, in which are several lilies: the white ones symbolize the Virgin's purity, while the red ones are another reference to Florence.

Schoenberger (1919–2011) was a Chicago cardiologist and medical research scientist who participated in early epidemiological studies and clinical trials that provided evidence linking smoking and other risk factors to cardiovascular diseases. He was Professor and Chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Rush University Medical Center (1973–1994) and served as president of the American Heart Association (1980–81). He was a public health advocate who participated in educational outreach programs. As an expert source, he utilized the national news media to warn Americans of the dangers of smoking and eating fatty foods. He lobbied the federal government to enact legislation that who impose more stringent regulation on the sale and advertising of tobacco products. Before retiring in 1994, he founded the Alzheimer’s Research Center at Rush University Medical Center, which later evolved into the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center. He continued to write academic articles and lecture as professor emeritus. Advocacy In his 1982 letter to President Ronald Reagan, Schoenberger criticized the administration for its decision to reverse policy and oppose hazard warning labels on cigarette packs: \\"I am quite concerned and puzzled by this news,\\" he wrote. \\"Much of my professional career has been devoted to medical practice in cardiology and to teaching and research in the fields of preventive medicine and epidemiology.

Dating from 1521–1534 the sculpture is a piece of the altar decoration of the Sagrestia Nuova in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence. The work, according to Michelangelo's letters and other documents, was one of the first works begun for the decoration of the Sagrestia Vecchia (Old Sacristy), as early as 1521. In 1526 it was still incomplete and in 1534, when Michelangelo moved to Rome, it was left in the current unfinished state and moved to the current location by Niccolò Tribolo. The Medici Madonna depicts a scene of the infant Jesus Christ sitting in the lap of the Virgin Mary and facing away from the viewer. Christ is attempting to nurse from the Virgin Mother, who by every indication appears to be denying her breast to her child. The Virgin Mary is positioned sitting with her right arm behind her and she is gripping the edge of her seat and then her left hand rests on Christ’s arm but is in no way securing him to her or offering an embrace. Another indication of the Virgin Mother denying the infant Christ of her breast is shown through the girdled chiton garment she is wearing that completely conceals her. There has been speculation that a Roman copy of the 5th century statue of Penelope influences the pose in this sculpture. Several preparatory drawings (at the British Museum and the Albertina) show a less compact composition, in which the Madonna's legs were parallel to each other. The composition is somewhat similar to the Madonna of the Stairs, with the Virgin sitting on nearly cubic block and breastfeeding the Child. The latter is turning his body towards his mother, hiding the face from the seer. Through Michelangelo’s personal writings, letters, and poetry that include recollections of his wet nurse it is known that Michelangelo was very emotionally engaged to the motherhood of Mary, relating the Virgin Mother to his own wet nurse. It is believed that although the work was commissioned, the Medici Madonna is largely tied to his own deep rooted personal issues.

It is one of the Divya Desams, the 108 temples of Vishnu revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham by the 12 poet saints, or Alwars. The temple is believed to be of significant antiquity with contributions at different times from the ruling kings. The temple is counted as one of the eight temples of Vishnu that self- manifested and is classified as Swayamvyaktha Kshetra. The temple is open till 6pm. The holy tank Chankra Kunda is associated with the temple and it is a pilgrimage centre where people take a holy dip during festive occasions. Legend Sage Narada is believed to have searched for the best theertha (water body) in three worlds. He went to Kailasa, the abode of Shiva, then to Parkadal(Kshir Sagar), the abode of Vishnu and finally landed in the water body in the Naimisha Forest. The central deity is also believed to be worshipped by sudharma and devas (celestial deities). Indra, the king of the devas, was once driven out of devaloka by an asura named Vritra. The asura was the recipient of a boon whereby he could not be killed by any weapon that was known till the date of his receiving the boon and additionally that no weapon made of wood or metal could harm him. Indra, who lost all hope of recovering his kingdom went to seek the aid of Vishnu. Vishnu revealed to Indra that only the weapon made from the bones of the sage Dadhichi would defeat Vritra. Indra and the other devas therefore approached the sage, whom Indra had once beheaded, and asked him for his aid in defeating Vritra. Dadhichi acceded to the devas' request but said that he wished that he had time to go on a pilgrimage to all the holy rivers before he gave up his life for them. Indra then brought together all the waters of the holy rivers to Naimisaranya, thereby allowing the sage to have his wish fulfilled without a further loss of time. Dadhichi is then said to have given up his life by the art of yoga after which the devas fashioned the Vajrayudha from his spine. This weapon was then used to defeat the asura, allowing Indra to reclaim his place as the king of devaloka. As told in another legend, when sages were planning to perform penance, Brahma, the god of creation, brought out a ring from darba grass. He asked the sages to perform penance at the place where the ring fell, which is believed to be Naimisaranya. The sages performed penance and at the end of it, Vishnu appeared to the sages and accepted their offerings. It is believed that the forest still has Vishnu and all sages as trees.r The temple Naimisaranyam is located at the junction of the roads from Sitapur and Khairabad, 32 km from Sitapur and 42 km from the Sandila railway station, 45 miles north of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. Naimisaranya is also known as Nimsar or Nimkhar and is located on the left bank of the river Gomati. The sacred well, namely Chakra Kunda is believed to have started from the weapon of Vishnu, Chakra. There are shrines dedicated to Chakranarayana, Ganesh, Rama, Lakshman. Religious significance This place has also been visited by SankaracharyaNew dimensions in Vedanta philosophy, Volume 1.Sahajānanda (Swami), Bochasanwasi Shri Aksharpurushottam Sanstha and the famous poet, Surdas resided here. Sage Suta (or Maharshi Suta), the author of 18 puranas is believed to have lived here and presented his sayings to the sages. The central deity is believed to have presided over the forest and hence the puja (rituals) are done to the forest. The temple is counted as one of the eight temples of Vishnu that self-manifested and is classified as Swayamvyakta Kshetra. (Seven other temples in the line are Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple, Bhu Varaha Swamy temple, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, and Vanamamalai Perumal Temple in South India and Saligrama, Pushkar and Badrinath Temple in North India). Naimisaranya temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Azhwar in ten hymns. The temple is classified as a divyadesam, the 108 Vishnu temples that are revered in the Vaishnava canon. Every new moon day, a large number of people purify themselves with a dip in the holy well. If the new moon falls on a Monday, it is believed that a holy bath in the well and offering to the presiding deity Lalitha will wash away all the sins committed in their lifetime.Saraswati 1984, p. 131 See also *Naimiṣāraṇya *Misrikh Neemsar Notes References * Category:Vishnu temples Category:Sitapur district ","title":"Naimisaranya"},{"id":"32992215","text":"Koiluoto (Cyrill. ) is an island in the Bay of Virolahti of the Gulf of Finland.

In 1984 he took part in the exhibition Von hier aus – Zwei Monate neue deutsche Kunst in Düsseldorf. Beginning in 1987 he was Professor für Freie Kunst und Visuelle Kommunikation (professor of free art and visual communication) at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg. He died in Cologne on 1 September 2011.  Works created together  Anna and Bernhard Blume together created installations, sequences of large photo scenes and, mostly in the 1990s, Polaroids. Both created drawings. They staged and photographed scenes in which they appeared themselves, with objects taking on a \\"life\\" of their own. According to the Deutsche Börse Group, their process was to create their picture sequences together and complete all related tasks without outside help. That included designing the sets and costumes, developing the negatives, and producing enlargements; at each stage the artwork was refined, polished and painted. Anna said: \\"Wir malen mit der Kamera, und diese malerische Arbeit findet auch noch im Labor statt.\\" (We paint with our camera, and this painterly work continues in the lab, too.) The images were produced without the aid of digital manipulation or post-production montages. Taking pictures of a \\"flying, crashing, and swirling world\\", the artists used safety features such as ropes, nets and mattresses. Their sequence Vasenekstasen (Vase Extasy) was shown at the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt. In 1989 MoMA in New York presented their works in a solo show, including Küchenkoller (Kitchen Frenzy, 1986), Opposites D (1989) and Demonstrative Identification with the universe (1971). In 2004, their Polaroids taken from 1988 to 2000 were published as a book, Das Glück ist ohne Pardon / Joy knows no mercy. They treated the genre of the artist's self-portrait to a transformation, distorting their faces with trivial objects such as coat hangers and household utensils, in order to \\"put to rest the myth of the portrait and the autonomy of the subject it seeks to convey.\\" Several works have been exhibited at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, which in 2005 showed Kreuzweg (Stations of the Cross), a sequence from Transzendentaler Konstruktivismus (Transcendental Constructivism), in connection with the World Youth Day 2005 in Cologne. In 2008 Reine Vernunft (Pure Reason) was presented at the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin. It was their first comprehensive appearance in the capital. According to the museum, the works provide \\"an overview of the ironical and philosophical strategy of this artistic team\\" and show \\"intensive dedication to a continuous process of self- experimentation\\", with the Blumes having \\"performed groundwork on the nature of German existence\\" by investigating \\"'home sweet home' for every conceivable form of misery\\" rather than entering the wider world. In 2009, their work appeared in the Berlin Gropiusbau at the exhibition \\"Sixty years. Sixty works\\", commemorating the 60th anniversary of the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 2010, several works were shown at the Kunstmuseum Bonn in \\"Der Westen leuchtet / Eine Standortbestimmung der Kunstlandschaft des Rheinlandes\\" (The Luminous West / A site assessment of the art landscape in the Rhineland), presenting artists of the Rhineland. In 2011, the first exhibition of their work after the death of Bernhard Blume, \\"Trans-Skulptur\\" in Berlin, was introduced by their friend Bazon Brock. He also spoke on 21 April 2016 at an exhibition Transcendental Constructivism of both artists at the Kolumba in Cologne, which showed their work in several rooms and ran from 2015 to 2016. = Works = This list of titles and translations is based on the listing for Anna and Bernhard Blume by the Museums of North Rhine- Westphalia. * 1977 Ödipale Komplikationen?

Born in Crowthorne, Berkshire, he was the son of Alexander Robert Campbell-Johnston and his wife Frances Ellen Bury Campbell-Johnston (née Paliser). He was educated at Marlborough College and then studied law in California. He returned to the United Kingdom where he was called to bar at the Inner Temple in 1893. He subsequently travelled to South Africa where he was admitted as a barrister in 1902. He returned to the United Kingdom in 1906. Campbell-Johnston became involved in Unionist politics, and stood unsuccessfully for parliament in the December 1910 general election as the Conservative candidate at Osgoldcross in the West Riding of Yorkshire. With the outbreak of the First World War, Campbell-Johnston obtained a commission in the 8th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment. In 1915 he was transferred to the General Staff as an Assistant Provost Marshal. He later transferred to the Royal Sussex Regiment and served on the Western Front from 1915–1918. Following the war he attempted to gain election to the London County Council in 1919, standing as a member of the Conservative-backed Municipal Reform Party at Bow and Bromley without success. Three years later he gained a place on the council, representing Balham and Tooting. In the same year he married May Isabel Fisk, a New York author. In 1931 a National Government was formed, and in October of that year a general election was held. Campbell-Johnston was chosen by the Conservatives to attempt to win the seat of East Ham South from the Labour Party, who opposed the National Government. He successfully unseated Alfred Barnes, the sitting MP. He resigned his London County Council seat at the 1934 local elections. When the next general election was called in 1935, Campbell-Johnston failed to hold his East Ham seat in a straight fight against Barnes, the man he had defeated four years earlier. In December 1935 he announced that he would not be standing for parliament again. In 1937 he returned to local government, winning election to the London County Council at Lewisham West. He died at his home in Marylebone, London in March 1938, aged 66. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.

The first priest mentioned in the Bible is Melchizedek, who was a priest of the Most High, and who officiated for Abraham.

As well, they would engage in many different rituals, such as the priestly blessing, the red heifer, the redemption of the firstborn, and various purification rituals. =Garments= The garments of the priests and high priests are described, and proscribed, in detail in Leviticus. For the high priest these include a priestly tunic, linen undergarments, sash, robe, priestly turban, ephod (with Urim and Thummim), and a priestly breastplate with 12 stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The priests served in rotating priestly divisions. Critical scholarship The starting point of much critical scholarship of the priesthood in ancient Israel is the thesis of Julius Wellhausen that Israel's history is redacted and represents three stages; (1) non Levitical priests, (2) Levitical priests, (3) Aaronids and Levites.Frank Moore Cross -Canaanite myth and Hebrew epic 1997 Chapter 8 The Priestly Houses of Early Israel p195 \\"The Classical View of Israel's Early Priesthood - One of the pillars of Julius Wellhausen's great synthesis of the history of Israelite religion was his reconstruction of the history of the\\" However Wellhausen's views depend on some critical, but unproven, assumptions, and some scholars consider that the study of the cult and priesthood of ancient Israel is still in its infancy compared to other areas of biblical studies.Priesthood and cult in ancient Israel ed.

The class, as well as the lead ship, were named for King Alfonso XIII's English queen consort, Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg. The other two ships were classified as \\"B\\" and \\"C\\". It was supposed to be designed by Vickers-Armstrongs, and built by John Brown. The ships were never built due to Britain's involvement in World War I, which halted all foreign projects being constructed in British yards.  Background  Illustration of an España-class battleship by Oscar Parkes Following disastrous losses in the Spanish–American War of 1898, Spain lacked the money to rebuild its navy, though the naval command made repeated requests for funding to begin reconstruction. The first two attempts, the Fleet Plan of 1903 and the Fleet Plan of 1905, both failed to secure parliamentary funding. Shortly thereafter, developments abroad spurred support to begin rebuilding the fleet. German expansionism had prompted Britain and France to come to the Entente Cordiale, putting aside their traditional rivalry to oppose Germany. The agreement directly affected Spain, since it settled matters of control over Morocco and placed Tangier under joint British–French–Spanish control. The agreement had the effect of bringing Spain closer with Britain and France, leading to an exchange of notes between the three governments in May 1907 that underlined an informal mutual defense agreement. The notes created the framework to contain the German-led Central Powers, whereby Britain would concentrate the bulk of its Royal Navy in the North Sea while Spain would contribute its fleet to support the French Navy against the combined fleets of Italy and Austria-Hungary. By that time, a new government led by Antonio Maura was in power, prompting the Navy to try again with the Fleet Plan of 1907; this was passed by the legislature early the following year as the Navy Law of 7 January 1908. It authorized three new battleships, which became the , consisting of the ships , , and , along with supporting destroyers and torpedo boats. The battleships were constrained by the size of existing Spanish harbor facilities to around , since the government lacked the funding to dredge harbors and enlarge dry docks to accept larger vessels. The delay enabled Spain to take advantage of experience gained by Britain with the world's first commissioned all-big-gun battleship, , along with those of other major naval powers that had already built their own \\"dreadnoughts\\". As the Navy had little experience designing capital ships, it issued a set of specifications for the battleships and requested proposals from foreign shipbuilders, securing tenders from British, French, Italian, and Austro-Hungarian shipyards. The Navy then took the best characteristics from each submission and made its own improvements before awarding the contract to Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval (SECN), a consortium created by three of the British firms—Armstrong Whitworth, Vickers, and John Brown & Company. In addition to the contracts for the ships themselves, SECN was also contracted to build the shipyard in Ferrol, Spain that would in turn build the ships. The repeated delays in the Spanish naval reconstruction program proved to be a detriment as well, since the Españas were rapidly surpassed by foreign vessels, most notably the so-called \\"super-dreadnoughts\\". By 1912, the need for additional battleships had become apparent, and Prime Minister José Canalejas pushed for a new law authorizing another group of three ships. After Canelejas was assassinated later that year, his successor, Álvaro de Figueroa and the naval minister, Amalio Gimeno, secured passage of the Plan de la Segunda Escuadra (Second Squadron Plan). The plan projected a second squadron of three dreadnoughts to supplement the España class, along with a pair of scout cruisers, nine destroyers, and three submarines. These dreadnoughts were named the Reina Victoria Eugenia class. They were to be in laid down in 1914 and 1915 and completed around 1920.  Design history  The British battleship ; Robert Gardiner and Randal Gray suggest that the Reina Victoria Eugenia class would have resembled this sort of British vessel The class consisted of three ships, Reina Victoria Eugenia, the lead ship, and two others referred to only by the temporary names B and C. The lead ship was named after King Alfonso's British wife. They were designed by SECN and were initially planned to displace with a speed of . Early plans for the type called for an armament of eight guns in four twin-gun turrets; however, financial difficulties resulted in the selection of an armament of eight guns instead, which still would have had a longer range than most contemporary ships. The secondary armament would have been twenty guns. The propulsion system was to consist of four Parsons steam turbines, driving four screw propellers; speed was to be around . Other specifications of the ships were either never decided upon or have not survived, although according to the naval historians Robert Gardiner and Randal Gray, it is probable that they would had an arrangement similar to British battleships of the period, with two pairs of superfiring turrets, one forward and one aft, with two closely spaced funnels. The design staff preferred guns, and by 1914, Eduardo Dato had become prime minister. He and his naval minister, Admiral Augusto Miranda, authorized a revision of the design upward to accept the larger guns, which necessitated an increase to at least . As with the España-class battleships, the guns, armor plate, and fire-control systems for which were manufactured in Britain, significant technical assistance from the British would have been required. The start of World War I in July 1914 threw the Spanish plans into disarray; after Italy declared neutrality, Spain followed suit, since her fleet was unnecessary for France to contain the Austro-Hungarians by itself. With the strategic need for the new battleships removed, Miranda immediately decided to reduce the construction program to focus on cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, since they were cheaper alternatives to a large fleet of battleships. Miranda's revised program was passed by the legislature as the Navy Law of 30 July 1914. After the war, the navy considered another major construction program centered on four battlecruisers that would have displaced around , but it was deemed to have been too ambitious and the plan was not formally proposed to parliament.

Biography Born and raised in urban Philadelphia, Stango attended Tyler School of Art at Temple University and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting and Graphic Design. After graduation, Stango was hired by Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores as a visual merchandiser and display artist. Later, Stango began to create silk screen T-shirts. Eventually he turned his attention and energy to painting full-time. Currently he works out of a historic warehouse outside of Philadelphia. Stango paints in the vein of such artists as Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, LeRoy Neiman, and Peter Max. Newspapers, retro advertising, pop icons, B-movies, mid-century modernism, magazines, noir films, vintage signage and pop-culture inspire his works. Batman and Elvis, Audrey Hepburn and Lucky Strike, and Mickey Mouse and Heineken are some of the well-known subjects of Stango's paintings. Career His paintings are shown in galleries across America, as well as in other countries including Sweden and Japan. His work has been purchased by a number of notable individuals such as Nicole Miller, Allen Iverson, and Governor Ed Rendell, and Swizz Beatz. In addition to selling his art, John also engages in philanthropy, using his paintings and proceeds to benefit charities.

There are at least three different ways this phrase is applied. It can refer to economic or financial risk found in stocks and funds, to political risk found in different countries, and to the impact of economic or financial variables on political risk. Macro risk can also refer to types of economic factors which influence the volatility over time of investments, assets, portfolios, and the intrinsic value of companies. Macro risk associated with stocks, funds, and portfolios is usually of concern to financial planners, securities traders, and investors with longer time horizons. Some of the macroeconomic variables that generate macro risk include unemployment rates, price indexes, monetary policy variables, interest rates, exchange rates, housing starts, agricultural exports, and even commodity prices such as gold. Models that incorporate macro risk are generally of two types. One type, used primarily by stock traders and institutions, focuses on how short-term changes in macro risk factors impact stock returns. These models include the arbitrage pricing theory and the modern portfolio theory families of models. The other models that incorporate macro risk data are valuation models or the closely related fundamental analysis models. Used primarily by those focusing on longer term investments including wealth managers, financial planners, and some institutional investors, these models are examples of intrinsic value analysis. In such analysis, forecasts of future company earnings are used to estimate the current and expected value of the investment being studied. Macro risk factors include any economic variables that are used to construct these estimates. Understanding that macro risk factors influence the intrinsic value of a particular investment is important because when the factors change values, errors can be introduced in the corresponding intrinsic value forecasts. Investors who follow the Black Swan Theory may try to reduce the overall exposure of their investments to different macro risk factors in order to reduce the impact of economic shocks. This may be accomplished using commercial portfolio optimization tools or by using mathematical programming methods. Another way macro risk is used is to differentiate between countries as potential places to invest. In this meaning, the level of a country's macro risk differentiates its level of political stability and its general growth opportunities from those of other countries, and thus helps identify preferred countries for investment either directly or through country or regionally oriented funds. Such analysis of political risk is also used in the analysis of financial derivatives such as credit default swaps and other sophisticated financial products. International rankings of countries, often updated annually, provide insight into their relative political and social stability and economic growth. A new application of macro risk is essentially a converse of the first two meanings; it refers to how macroeconomics and fluctuations in financial variables generate political risk. For example, economic turbulence that leads to higher or lower levels of approval for the president's policies would be a form of this macro risk. References  * External links *Tainer, E.M.

As a youth, he was the youngest of the Sonnō jōi samurai to participate in the \\"Terada-ya Incident\\", an assassination attempt against Sakamoto Ryōma at the Terada-ya inn in Kyoto. During the Anglo-Satsuma War of 1863, he fought alongside Ōyama Iwao and Saigō Tsugumichi. After the end of the conflict, he was sent to Edo, and then to Hakodate, where he was ordered to study rangaku and western customs under Takeda Ayasaburō. He then went to Yokohama to learn English from Samuel Robbins Brown. =Leaving Japan= In May 1866, with the assistance of Thomas Blake Glover, Yoshihara was one of five Satsuma samurai smuggled out of Japan on a Portuguese cargo ship to England, in violation of the national seclusion laws of the Tokugawa shogunate. Nire Kagenori was another of the five samurai in this mission. The five travelled via the Cape of Good Hope to London, where they met with the members of the first Satsuma delegation to England, which had arrived a year earlier. These included Mori Arinori, Terashima Munenori and Godai Tomoatsu. Yoshihara continued on to the United States, where he studied at the Wilbraham & Monson Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts (per a recommendation from Samuel Robbins Brown) in 1867. The same year, he met with Niijima Jō, who was studying near Boston. In January 1869, Yoshihara was baptized as a Christian at the Owasco Outlet Dutch Reformed Church shortly before he was accepted into Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut in 1869, where he studied political science and law. =Germany= Following the Meiji Restoration, he accompanied Ōyama Iwao, Shinagawa Yajirō and Nakahama Manjirō to Germany in 1871 during the Franco-Prussian War as official military observers, visiting Frankfurt, Berlin and calling on Paris during a ceasefire. Returning to Frankfurt, the delegation purchased modern currency printing machines, which were used by the Meiji government to print its first banknotes. In 1872, Yoshihara was a last- minute addition to the Iwakura Mission in the position of Third Secretary. The delegation met with President Ulysses S. Grant, but was unsuccessful in its goal of revising the unequal treaties. He accompanied the Mission on to England and returned to Japan in March 1873. =Japan= On his return to Japan, Yoshihara accepted a post at the Foreign Ministry as First Secretary, and was assigned as a liaison to the American Consulate-General in Japan. The following year, he joined the Ministry of Finance as Director of the Yokohama Customs Office. However, in 1874 at the request of Ōkubo Toshimichi, he joined Gustave Emile Boissonade and the Japanese delegation to Qing dynasty China in the negotiations leading to the Japanese Expedition of 1874 to Taiwan. He returned to the Ministry of Finance in 1877 as First Secretary and Director of the Customs Bureau. =Paris= In November 1878, Yoshihara accompanied Matsukata Masayoshi and Aoki Shuzo to Paris in another unsuccessful attempt at revision of the unequal treaties. On February 28, 1880, he was made a director of the Yokohama Specie Bank and also held the post of Vice-Finance Minister. With the creation of the Bank of Japan, per the recommendation of Matsukata Masayoshi, Yoshihara was selected as the 1st Governor of the Bank of Japan on October 6, 1882. During his tenure, he established the use of compound interest, promissory notes and bank checks. In 1885, he spent 10 months overseas, touring various European capitals. =Death= Yoshihara died while in office on December 19, 1887 References *Tamaki, Norio. Japanese Banking: A History, 1859-1959.
