The track was surveyed and built by Len Beadell, Australian surveyor, who named it after his wife. The track passes through remote arid deserts and scrub territory of South Australia and Western Australia, which often have summer temperatures as high as . Sand dunes predominate for most of the track. Map and overview File:Anne Beadell Highway 0116.svgThe Anne Beadell Highway (depicted in purple) Map details as at 1972 The road was constructed to provide access for a series of surveys adding to the overall geodetic survey of unexplored parts of Australia. The information was required for rocket range projects at Woomera. Construction was completed in five stages, spanning nine years from 1953 to 1962. The first stage from Mabel Creek station near Coober Pedy, west towards Emu Field, was built in February and March 1953 to provide access for British atomic tests at Emu Field. This stage preceded the formation of Beadell's Gunbarrel Road Construction Party, and was the first road built by Beadell. The second stage was begun in July 1957 in the reverse direction, from Anne's Corner towards Emu Field, after Beadell had completed the Mount Davies Road in the north-west of South Australia. The third stage was commenced in August 1961, running westward from Anne's Corner to Vokes Hill. In April 1962 the fourth stage proceeded west from Vokes Hill, beyond Serpentine Lakes towards the future Neale Junction where the construction party arrived on 16 August. From Neale Junction during August and September 1962 the north-south Connie Sue Highway was constructed between Warburton and Rawlinna. The fifth stage of the Anne Beadell Highway was then commenced, and was completed at Yamarna near Lake Yeo when it joined an existing track to Laverton on 17 November 1962. Beadell put considerable effort into rediscovering Vokes Hill while surveying the track, as a new device called a Tellurometer was being introduced. It used radio waves for distance measurement, thus requiring high points for operation. Fuel and supplies The track is suitable for only well-provisioned and experienced four-wheel drivers. There are no settlements between Coober Pedy and Laverton. A roadhouse named Ilkurlka in Western Australia, opened in 2003, west of the Western Australia - South Australian state border at the intersection of the Madura Loongana Track (Aboriginal Business Road) and the Anne Beadell Highway. The roadhouse caters mainly for local Aboriginal communities and may be the most isolated roadhouse in Australia. There are still no provisions for the between Ilkurlka and Coober Pedy. Places of interest Neale Junction, where the Anne Beadell Highway intersects with the Connie Sue Highway (another outback track constructed by Len Beadell), is west of Ilkurlka. This plane wreck provides a sudden change in scenery on an isolated road () The track passes through the former British atomic test site of Emu Field, rabbit and dog fences, restricted nature conservation areas, and Aboriginal lands, all of which require permits to pass through. Also of interest is the wreck of a light aircraft near the track in Western Australia. The road also passes through Mamungari Conservation Park in South Australia which is one of Australia's fourteen World Biosphere Reserves and the Tallaringa Conservation Park. Conditions Because the track is remote and not signposted, GPS is advisable and HF radio or satellite phone are recommended. In good conditions, it may take 5 days to complete the journey. However, hazards such as flat tyres, breakdowns, and the occasional flash floods must be taken into account.

Since the 17th century the windmill has been known for more than just its milling capabilities. Nineteenth-century owners and millers, the Debray family, made a brown bread, galette, which became popular and thus the name of the windmill and its businesses, which have included a famous guinguette and restaurant. In the 19th century, Le Moulin de la Galette represented diversion for Parisians seeking entertainment, a glass of wine and bread made from flour ground by the windmill. Artists, such as Renoir, van Gogh, and Pissarro have immortalized Le Moulin de la Galette; likely the most notable was Renoir's festive painting, Bal du moulin de la Galette. Windmill The present day Moulin de la Galette restaurant topped by the original Moulin Radet. The windmill Moulin de la Galette, also known as Blute-fin, was built in 1622. The name Blute-fin comes from the French verb bluter which means sifting flour for the separation from bran. The Debray family acquired the two mills in 1809 for producing flour, the Blute-fin and the Radet, built in 1717. But it was also used to pressurize the harvest or grind materials needed for manufacturing. An association Friends of Old Montmartre saved it from destruction in 1915. In 1924, its owner moved the windmill to the corner of Girardon and Lepic streets. It was restored in 1978, but is not running. The windmill has been classified as a monument since 1958. Moulin de la Galette Sieges in 1814 and 1870 At the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814, during the siege of Paris three Debray men lost their lives defending the windmill against Cossacks; the miller was killed and nailed to the wings of the windmill. During the Franco-Prussian War Montmartre was attacked by 20,000 Prussian soldiers. During the siege, Pierre- Charles Debray was killed and nailed to the wings of the windmill. A mass grave for those killed during the siege was made just steps away from the Moulin de la Galette. Commercial expansion The mill was turned into a by the surviving son of the miller killed during the siege of Paris in 1814. Auguste Renoir, Bal du moulin de la Galette 1876 The current name Moulin de la Galette is based upon galette, a small brown bread that the Debray millers, who owned the mill in the 19th century, made and sold with a glass of milk. The tasty bread became so popular that it later became the name of the windmill. In 1830, they replaced milk with wine (especially the local Montmartre wine) and the windmill became a cabaret. Parisians made their way to Montmartre to enjoy \\"the simple pleasures\\" of the countryside with a glass of wine, freshly baked bread and a terrace view of Paris and the Seine below. In 1833, one of the Debrays decided to open an area for dancing, dedicated to the Greek muse Terpsichore. His flair for dancing and enthusiasm attracted patrons to the dancing hall and it became a success. Author √âmile Zola wrote in 1876, \\"We rushed off into the countryside to celebrate the joy of not having to listen to any more talk about politics,\\" which often meant reflection of France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. Montmartre, attainable by a train ride or a one-hour walk, was still a village with orchards, shops and two remaining windmills. Photo of Moulin de la Galette in 1885 Moulin de la Galette panorama As the nearby fields were replaced with housing and factories, Nicholas Charles Debray sought commercial opportunities to remain a going concern. One of the windmills was turned into a viewing tower and a dance hall was opened adjacently. People came to the relaxed, popular Moulin de la Galette for entertainment and dancing. Over its history, the building has experienced a wide range of uses: open-air cafe, music-hall, television studios and restaurant. It is now a private property. The windmill Radet, however, marks the entrance to a bistro named Le Moulin de la Galette.

Most often this takes the form of starting a plant from seed in optimal conditions, such as in a greenhouse or protected nursery bed, then replanting it in another, usually outdoor, growing location. This is common in market gardening and truck farming, where setting out or planting out are synonymous with transplanting. In the horticulture of some ornamental plants, transplants are used infrequently and carefully because they carry with them a significant risk of killing the plant.Basics of horticulture - Simson, Straus. Oxford Book Company, Edition 2010 Transplanting has a variety of applications, including: * Extending the growing season by starting plants indoors, before outdoor conditions are favorable; * Protecting young plants from diseases and pests until they are sufficiently established; * Avoiding germination problems by setting out seedlings instead of direct seeding. Different species and varieties react differently to transplanting; for some, it is not recommended. In all cases, avoiding transplant shock--the stress or damage received in the process--is the principal concern. Plants raised in protected conditions usually need a period of acclimatization, known as hardening off (see also frost hardiness). Also, root disturbance should be minimized. The stage of growth at which transplanting takes place, the weather conditions during transplanting, and treatment immediately after transplanting are other important factors.  Transplant production systems  Commercial growers employ what are called containerized and non-containerized transplant production. Containerized transplants or plugs allow separately grown plants to be transplanted with the roots and soil intact. Typically grown in peat pots (a pot made of compressed peat), soil blocks (compressed blocks of soil), paper pots or multiple-cell containers such as plastic packs (four to twelve cells) or larger plug trays made of plastic or styrofoam. Non-containerized transplants are typically grown in greenhouse ground beds or benches, outdoors in-ground with row covers and hotbeds, and in-ground in the open field. The plants are pulled with bare roots for transplanting, which are less-expensive than containerized transplants, but with lower yields due to poorer plant reestablishment. Containerized stock Containerized planting stock is classified by the type and size of container used. A great variety of containers has been used, with various degrees of success. Some containers are designed to be planted with the tree e.g., the tar paper pot, the Alberta peat sausage, the Walters square bullet, and paper pot systems, are filled with rooting medium and planted with the tree (Tinus and McDonald 1979).Tinus, R.W.; McDonald, S.E. 1979. How to grow tree seedlings in containers in greenhouses. USDA, For. Serv., Rocky Mountain For. Range Exp. Sta., Fort Collins CO, Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-60. 256 p. (Cited in Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Also planted with the tree are other containers that are not filled with rooting medium, but in which the container is a molded block of growing medium, as with Polyloam, Tree Start, and BR-8 Blocks. Designs of containers for raising planting stock have been many and various. Containerized white spruce stock is now the norm. Most containers are tube-like; both diameter and volume affect white spruce growth (Hocking and Mitchell 1975, Carlson and Endean 1976).Hocking, D.; Mitchell, D.L. 1975.

Res. 6:221‚Äì225. White spruce grown in a container having a 1:1 height:diameter produced significantly greater dry weight than those in containers of 3:1 and 6:1 height:diameter configurations. Total dry weight and shoot length increased with increasing container volume. The larger the container, the fewer deployed per unit area. However, the biological advantage of size has been enough to influence a pronounced swing towards larger containers in British Columbia (Coates et al. 1994).Coates, K.D.; Haeussler, S.; Lindeburgh, S.; Pojar, R.; Stock, A.J. 1994. Ecology and silviculture of interior spruce in British Columbia. Canada/British Columbia Partnership Agreement For. Resour. Devel., Victoria BC, FRDA Rep. 220. 182 p. The number of PSB211 (2 cm top diameter, 11 cm long) styroblock plugs ordered in British Columbia decreased from 14,246,000 in 1981 to zero in 1990, while orders for PSB415 (4 cm top diameter, 15 cm long) styroblock plugs increased in the same period from 257 000 to 41 008 000, although large stock is more expensive than small to raise, distribute, and plant. Other containers are not planted with the tree, e.g., Styroblock, Superblock, Copperblock, and Miniblock container systems, produce Styroplug seedlings with roots in a cohesive plug of growing medium. The plug cavities vary in volume by various combinations of top diameter and depth, from 39 to 3260 mL, but those most commonly used, at least in British Columbia, are in the range 39 mL to 133 mL (Van Eerden and Gates 1990).Van Eerden, E.; Gates, J.W. 1990. Seedling production and processing: container. p. 226‚Äì234 in Lavender, D.P.; Parish, R.; Johnson, C.M.; Montgomery, G.; Vyse, A.; Willis, R.A.; Winston, D. (Eds.). Regenerating British Columbia‚Äôs Forests. Univ. B.C. Press, Vancouver BC. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994) The BC-CFS Styroblock plug, developed in 1969/70, has become the dominant stock type for interior spruce in British Columbia (Van Eerden and Gates 1990, Coates et al. 1994). Plug sizes are indicated by a 3-figure designation, the 1st figure of which gives the top diameter and the other 2 figures the depth of the plug cavity, both dimensions approximations in centimetres. The demand for larger plugs has been increasing strongly (Table 6.24; Coates et al. 1994). Stock raised in some sizes of plug can vary in age class. In British Columbia, for example, PSB 415 and PSB 313 plugs are raised as 1+0 or 2+0. PSB 615 plugs are seldom raised other than as 2+0. Initially, the intention was to leave the plugs in situ in the Styroblocks until immediately before planting. But this led to logistic problems and reduced the efficiency of planting operations. Studies to compare the performance of extracted, packaged stock versus in situ stock seem not to have been carried out, but packaged stock has performed well and given no indication of distress.

RM-89A. 11 p. cautioned against using dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) to cool seedlings; he claimed that respiration and water transport in seedlings are disrupted by high concentrations of gaseous carbon dioxide. Coniferous planting stock is often held in frozen storage, mostly at ‚àí2 ¬∞C, for extended periods and then cool-stored (+2 ¬∞C) to thaw the root plug prior to outplanting. Thawing is necessary if frozen seedlings cannot be separated from one another and has been advocated by some in order to avoid possible loss of contact between plug and soil with shrinkage of the plug with melting of ice in the plug. Physiological activity is also greater under cool rather than frozen storage, but seedlings of interior spruce and Engelmann spruce that were planted while still frozen had only brief and transient physiological effects, including xylem water potential, (Camm et al. 1995, Silem and Guy 1998).Camm, E.L.; Guy, R.D.; Kubien, D.S.; Goetze, D.C.; Silim, S.N.; Burton, P.J. 1995.

Studies of storage and planting practices have generally focussed on the effects of duration of frozen storage and the effects of subsequent cool storage (e.g., Ritchie et al. 1985, Chomba et al. 1993, Harper and Camm 1993).Ritchie, G.A.; Roden, J.R.; Kleyn, N. 1985.

Planting frozen conifer seedlings: warming trends and effects on seedling performance. New For. 23:225‚Äì237. noted several lines of evidence suggesting that cool storage can have negative effects on seedling health. The rate of respiration is faster during cool storage than in frozen storage, so depleting carbohydrate reserves more rapidly. Certainly in the absence of light during cool storage, and to an indeterminate extent if seedlings are exposed to light (unusual), carbohydrate reserves are depleted (Wang and Zwiacek 1999).Wang, Y.; Zwiazek, J.J. 1999. Effects of early spring photosynthesis on carbohydrate content, bud flushing and root and shoot growth of Picea glauca bareroot seedlings. Scand. J. For. Res. 14:295‚Äì302. As well, Silem and Guy (1998), for instance, found that interior spruce seedlings had significantly lower total carbohydrate reserves if stored for 2 weeks at 2 ¬∞C than if thawed rapidly for 24 hours at 15 ¬∞C. Seedlings can rapidly lose cold hardiness in cool storage through increased respiration and consumption of intracellular sugars that function as cryoprotectants (Ogren 1997).Ogren, E. 1997. Relationship between temperature, respiratory loss of sugar and premature hardening in dormant Scots pine seedlings. Tree Physiology 17:47‚Äì51. Also, depletion of carbohydrate reserves impairs the ability of seedlings to make root growth. Finally, storage moulds are much more of a problem during cool than frozen storage. Kooistra and Bakker (2002), therefore, tested the hypothesis that such thawing is unnecessary. Seedlings of 3 species including interior spruce were planted with frozen root plugs (frozen seedlings) and with thawed root plugs (thawed seedlings). Thawed root plugs warmed to soil temperature in about 20 minutes; frozen root plugs took about 2 hours, ice in the plug having to melt before the temperature could rise above zero. Size of root plug influenced thawing time. These outplantings were into warm soil by boreal standards, and seedlings with frozen plugs might fare differently if outplanted into soil at temperatures more typical of planting sites in spring and at high elevations. Variable fluorescence did not differ between thawed and frozen seedlings. Bud break was no faster among thawed interior spruce seedlings than among frozen. Field performance did not differ between thawed and frozen seedlings.

Retrieved on 2009-03-06. After decades of obscurity, the opening was revitalized by the International Master Georgi Orlov, who published a booklet and a book about it in 1992 and 1998, respectively. Orlov rechristened the opening the \\"Black Knights' Tango\\".He explained, \\"this no-name opening has languished, rarely getting even an honorable mention. I hope to change that by first highlighting the defense with a catchy name. Thus The Black Knights Tango!\\" Orlov 1992, p. 2. His 1998 book added the apostrophe after \\"Knights\\". Since 1992, the opening has been employed by a number of strong grandmasters, including Victor Bologan, Joel Benjamin, Larry Christiansen, and Alex Yermolinsky.Palliser, pp. 7, 10. Yermolinsky has even ventured it against Garry Kasparov. Basic ideas Although fairly uncommon, the \\"Tango\\" has a sounder positional basis than most other offbeat openings: Black develops quickly, has a flexible pawn structure, and is prepared to strike back in the center with 3...e5, or with ...e6 and ...d5. The opening has some distinct variations but it is highly transpositional, and may transpose to the King's Indian Defense, Nimzo‚ÄìIndian Defense, Bogo‚ÄìIndian Defense, Chigorin Defense, Ragozin System, Catalan Opening, and English Opening. Possible continuations = 3.Nf3 = The most common move, preventing 3...e5.Palliser, p. 82. Black usually responds with 3...e6, although 3...d6, intending a kind of Old Indian Defense, is also possible.Orlov 1998, pp. 53‚Äì54. After 3...e6, White can play 4.Nc3 Bb4 (transposing to the Nimzo‚ÄìIndian Defense);Palliser, p. 92.Orlov 1998, p. 80. 4.a3, when Black can either play 4...d5 (reaching a kind of Queen's Gambit Declined or Ragozin System),Orlov 1998, p. 118. or 4...d6 preparing 5...e5 or even 5...g6 (\\"championed by Bologan\\", according to Palliser), reaching a sort of King's Indian Defense;Palliser, p. 176.Orlov 1998, pp. 115‚Äì18. or 4.g3, when Black can transpose to the Catalan Opening with 4...d5, recommended by PalliserPalliser, p. 159.Orlov 1998, pp. 59‚Äì60. or 4...Bb4+, preferred by Orlov, which transposes to a Nimzo‚ÄìIndian after 5.Nc3, or to a Bogo‚ÄìIndian Defense after 5.Bd2 or 5.Nbd2.Orlov 1998, pp. 60‚Äì61, 80. = 3.Nc3 = This is White's second-most popular move.Orlov 1998, p. 26. After the thematic 3...e5, one possibility for White is 4.Nf3, transposing to an English Opening.Palliser, p. 76. Palliser recommends 4...e4!? in response, while Orlov prefers 4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bb4.Orlov 1998, p. 27. Instead, the main line is 4.d5 Ne7.Orlov 1998, p. 28. Now the game may continue in \\"Tango\\" fashion, for example with 5.Nf3 Ng6, or transpose to the King's Indian Defense with, for example, 5.Nf3 d6 6.e4 (6.Bg5!?) g6 7.Be2 Bg7 8.O-O O-O, reaching the main line of the King's Indian by transposition.Orlov 1998, pp. 34‚Äì35. Another interesting but relatively unexplored idea is 3...e6, allowing White to play 4.e4 (other moves such as 4.d5, 4.Bg5, 4.a3, 4.f3, and 4.Nf3 are also possible), whereupon Black follows up with 4...d5. From that position, the main possibilities are 5.e5 (the main line), 5.exd5, 5.cxd5, and 5.Bg5. These possibilities can also be reached via transposition from the Flohr‚ÄìMikenas Variation of the English Opening (1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.e4), although if Black wishes to play this way, the optimal move order is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nc6. = 3.d5 = { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\"    } This ambitious move is playable but rarely seen.Palliser, p. 55.

Along with its related Triple-O's quick service brand, the chain operates over 100 locations in British Columbia, Alberta, and Asia. History The original White Spot location on Granville Street at 67th Avenue In the 1920s, White Spot's founder, Nat Bailey, operated a travelling lunch counter in Vancouver, operating out of a 1918 Model T. He sold hotdogs for a dime and ice cream for a nickel. In 1928, Bailey founded the first White Spot restaurant. Initially, he had planned on naming the eatery the Granville Barbecue, but changed his mind instead taking the advice of a friend who suggested he call it White Spot in honour of a restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, California‚Äîin part because the name sounded spotless and clean. That White Spot restaurant in Los Angeles has long since closed. The first restaurant was located in the Marpole neighbourhood, at 67th and Granville Street, at what would become known as Granville House, in Vancouver, British Columbia. The restaurant was called White Spot Barbecue Sandwiches, evolving into a drive-in and dining room. By 1955, the chain was serving 10,000 cars a day and 110,000 customers a week. By the 1990s, some White Spot drive-ins were phased out owing to an increase in the number of franchise restaurants and a gradual decrease in the popularity of drive-ins. Granville House was a popular dining spot until 1986 when a fire in the kitchen damaged the building. The restaurant closed permanently at that location shortly thereafter, despite some talk of rebuilding. =Franchising and growth= The chain was sold to General Foods in 1968 when Bailey retired. In 1982, White Spot returned to local ownership when the company was purchased by BC businessman Peter Toigo, becoming part of Shato Holdings Limited. After his death in 1993, his sons Peter and Ron Toigo took over ownership. In 1986, the chain was sued in the court case Gee v. White Spot.Gee v. White Spot Ltd., (1986) 7 BCLR (2d) 235, available on CanLII at http://canlii.ca/t/210nf The plaintiffs, Mr. Gee and Mr. and Mrs. Pan, claimed damages for botulism poisoning related to a beef dip sandwich. The decision made it easier for diners to sue restaurants for breach of contract and implied warranty instead of the harder-to-prove negligence (Canadian tort law expressly disavows strict product liability). In 1993, White Spot introduced franchising, and in 1997 it launched its Triple-O's quick service brand, which is named after White Spots' trademark hamburger sauce. Since 1999, the company's franchises have been installed on some ships in the BC Ferries fleet. By the 2000s, the chain was opening burger-focused takeouts at its Triple-O's locations. In 2012, 64 White Spot restaurants and 62 Triple -O's served 17 million customers and generated $200 million in gross revenues. A pirate pack plundered of its chocolate doubloon and ice cream Chef Chuck Currie has been featured in marketing campaigns alongside guest celebrity chefs hailing from Vancouver, including John Bishop, Rob Feenie, Umberto Menghi, and Melissa Craig. International locations A Triple O's restaurant in Pacific Place, Hong Kong. The company experimented with international locations across the nearby United States border in Bellingham, Washington, without much success. Abroad, White Spot has expanded its Triple-O's chain into Hong Kong in the early 2000s and, more recently, Bangkok and Singapore. In Hong Kong, four such stores can be found at the basement of Pacific Place, and in Exchange Square, on the Hong Kong Island; and at Cooked Deli in the Harbour City shopping mall in Kowloon and in Shatin. The three Hong Kong franchises each record more than twice as many sales as the average location in BC. A location in Seoul, South Korea, opened in September, 2008. It is located near Dosan Park, in the Apgujeong neighbourhood.

Its range extends south and east from the Khasi Hills in the northeast Indian state of Meghalaya, to northern Thailand, Philippines, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, southernmost China, and Vietnam. It is an important plantation species elsewhere in the world, including in southern Africa and South America. The common name \\"Khasi pine\\" is from the Khasi hills in India, and \\"Benguet pine\\" is from the landlocked province of Benguet in Luzon, Philippines, where it is the dominant species of the Luzon tropical pine forests. The Benguet pine is sometimes treated as a separate species, Pinus insularis; however, the current opinion is to treat these as conspecific with P. kesiya. The city of Baguio is nicknamed \\"The City of Pines\\", as it is noted for large stands of this tree. Description Bark of Benguet pine Pinus kesiya is a tree reaching up to 30‚Äì35 m tall with a straight, cylindrical trunk. The bark is thick and dark brown, with deep longitudinal fissures. The branches are robust, red brown from the second year, the branchlets horizontal to drooping. The leaves are needle-like, dark green, usually 3 per fascicle, 15‚Äì20 cm long, the fascicle sheath 1‚Äì2 cm long and persistent. The cones are ovoid, 5‚Äì9 cm long, often curved downwards, sometimes slightly distorted; the scales of second-year cones are dense, the umbo a little convex, sometimes acutely spinous. The scales have transverse and longitudinal ridges across the middle of the scale surface. The seeds are winged, 6‚Äì7 mm long with a 1.5‚Äì2.5 cm wing. Pollination is in mid spring, with the cones maturing 18‚Äì20 months after. Khasi pine usually grows in pure stands or mixed with broad-leaved trees, but does not form open pine forests. Commercial use The soft and light timber of Pinus kesiya can be used for a wide range of applications, including boxes, paper pulp, and temporary electric poles. It is intensely used for timber, both sourced in natural forests and plantations. The good-quality resin is not abundant and has not been much used except during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines for the production of turpentine.

Statement Suppose that R is a binary relation on a class X such that *R is set-like: R‚àí1[x] = {y : y R x} is a set for every x, *R is well-founded: every nonempty subset S of X contains an R-minimal element (i.e. an element x ‚àà S such that R‚àí1[x] ‚à© S is empty), *R is extensional: R‚àí1[x] ‚â† R‚àí1[y] for every distinct elements x and y of X The Mostowski collapse lemma states that for any such R there exists a unique transitive class (possibly proper) whose structure under the membership relation is isomorphic to (X, R), and the isomorphism is unique. The isomorphism maps each element x of X to the set of images of elements y of X such that y R x (Jech 2003:69). Generalizations Every well-founded set-like relation can be embedded into a well-founded set- like extensional relation. This implies the following variant of the Mostowski collapse lemma: every well-founded set-like relation is isomorphic to set- membership on a (non-unique, and not necessarily transitive) class. A mapping F such that F(x) = {F(y) : y R x} for all x in X can be defined for any well- founded set-like relation R on X by well-founded recursion. It provides a homomorphism of R onto a (non-unique, in general) transitive class. The homomorphism F is an isomorphism if and only if R is extensional. The well- foundedness assumption of the Mostowski lemma can be alleviated or dropped in non-well-founded set theories. In Boffa's set theory, every set-like extensional relation is isomorphic to set-membership on a (non-unique) transitive class. In set theory with Aczel's anti-foundation axiom, every set- like relation is bisimilar to set-membership on a unique transitive class, hence every bisimulation-minimal set-like relation is isomorphic to a unique transitive class. Application Every set model of ZF is set-like and extensional. If the model is well-founded, then by the Mostowski collapse lemma it is isomorphic to a transitive model of ZF and such a transitive model is unique. Saying that the membership relation of some model of ZF is well- founded is stronger than saying that the axiom of regularity is true in the model. There exists a model M (assuming the consistency of ZF) whose domain has a subset A with no R-minimal element, but this set A is not a \\"set in the model\\" (A is not in the domain of the model, even though all of its members are). More precisely, for no such set A there exists x in M such that A = R‚àí1[x]. So M satisfies the axiom of regularity (it is \\"internally\\" well- founded) but it is not well-founded and the collapse lemma does not apply to it.

His deeply religious family life (his mother was a Seventh-day Adventist and his grandmother a Revivalist) imbued him with a profound spirituality. During his youth, his favourite singers were reggae legends Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, musicians who strongly influenced his own style.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p.17 Peter Tosh's influence can definitely be heard in Anthony B's vocal delivery and revolutionary stance. Anthony B adopted Rastafari movement beliefs as a teenager, a decision which was not well received by his family. The stubborn and determined Anthony B refused to give up his new religion and his dreadlocks and moved to the home of his aunt and uncle in the Kingston suburb, Portmore. He is a member of the Bobo Ashanti branch of the movement. \\"Bobo Dreads\\", as they are known, are recognisable by their long robes and turbans. The strong Afrocentric pride and the other Rastafarian beliefs (or \\"overstandings\\" as Rastafarians prefer to call them) are reflected in his songs. =Career= While attending high school, Anthony B debuted as a deejay for the local sound system, Shaggy Hi-Power. In 1988, he befriended reggae artists such as Determine, Mega Banton, Ricky General and Terror Fabulous. At this point in the reggae industry, singing \\"slack\\" songs about women was the popular thing to do. Anthony B did not believe in degrading women and chose to pen politically slanted songs instead. He collaborated with Little Devon and made his debut single \\"The Living is Hard\\" on the Wizard label in 1993.

He sat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003, representing the riding of Carleton‚ÄîGloucester (renamed as Ottawa‚ÄîOrl√©ans) for the Progressive Conservative Party. Coburn was a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. He is not to be confused with the person of the same name who represents the same area on the Ottawa-Carleton Catholic School Board. Background Coburn was educated at Brock University in St. Catharines. A small businessman, he served for ten years as the Mayor of Cumberland. Coburn also served on the Board of Governors for Algonquin College in Ottawa. As mayor, he earned a reputation for fiscal prudence. Politics Coburn was elected for Carleton‚ÄîGloucester in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Ren Danis by over 6,000 votes. This was considered a major upset. The riding had been solidly Liberal for many years, and most observers thought Danis would win an easy victory. Coburn's win may be attributed to personal popularity and a local issue: many residents saw construction workers from Quebec as a threat to local employment, and voted Tory to protest the situation. After sitting as a backbencher for two years, Coburn was appointed to the government of Mike Harris as Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs on February 8, 2001. In 2002, Coburn endorsed Ernie Eves to succeed Mike Harris as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. When Eves became Premier on April 15, 2002, he named Coburn Associate Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing with Responsibility for Rural Affairs. On February 25, 2003, Coburn was moved to the Minister of Tourism and Recreation. Coburn carried the banner of an increasingly unpopular party into the 2003 provincial election. The presence of Quebec workers was no longer an issue, and many local residents were angered by increased energy rates under the Harris and Eves governments. Despite gaining endorsements from several local newspapers, Coburn lost to Liberal Phil McNeely, another municipal politician, by about 4,500 votes. In 2004, he endorsed Frank Klees for the leadership of the Ontario PC Party. =Cabinet positions= Electoral record Later life Coburn was appointed as a Citizenship Judge for Ottawa, Ontario in October 2006.

Early life  Gromov's father, Mikhail Konstantinovich Gromov, was of noble intelligentsia and served as military medic. His mother, Lyubov Ignatyevna Andreeva, was from peasant family, had obstetrician training. Gromov spent his childhood in Kaluga, Rzhev, Myza-Raevo (near Moscow). He graduated from Voskresensky Real School in Moscow, he studied in IMTS from 1916 to 1917. In 1917, Gromov graduated from aviation theoretical courses at IMTS and started his army service.  Career  Upon graduation from the Moscow Central Aviation School in 1918, Gromov served as a flight instructor and military pilot. In 1923, he won the Soviet championship in weightlifting (heavy body mass, over 82,5 kg). In 1925, he started working as a test pilot testing the aeroplanes designed by Andrei Tupolev and Nikolai Polikarpov in Air Force Research Institute. From 1930 to 1941, Gromov worked in the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute and became chief-pilot. On 25 April 1927 made the first Soviet parachute jump out of a Polikarpov I-1 under testing that had entered an unrecoverable spin., pp. 286-287. From June to September 1925, Gromov flew the Polikarpov R-1 in the long-haul group flight of nine aeroplanes on the route Moscow-Beijing-Tokyo. On 30 August 1926, Gromov started and completed in three days a European promotional flight in a Tupolev ANT-3 on the route Moscow-K√∂nigsberg-Berlin-Paris-Rome-Vienna-Prague-Warsaw- Moscow. From 10 to 12 September 1934, Gromov, A. I. Filin, and I. T. Spirin in a Tupolev ANT-25 made a record closed-circle non-stop flight on the route Moscow-Ryazan-Kharkov, flying in 75 hours. He was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for this deed. From 12 to 14 July 1937, Gromov, A. B. Yumashev, and S. A. Danilin established a new non-stop flight distance record of from Moscow to San Jacinto, California, via the North Pole in a Tupolev ANT-25. Gromov used his influence and renown among the government to attain reconsideration of Sergei Korolev's case, which resulted in his transfer from prison camp at Kolyma to TsKB-29. From March to August 1941, Gromov was the first director of the Flight Research Institute, a flight research and testing centre in Zhukovsky. The name of M. M. Gromov was awarded to the institute in 1991 to celebrate 50th anniversary of the institute. During World War II, Gromov took command of several units: * From December 1941 to February 1942, Gromov was commander of 31st Mixed Aviation Division (Kalinin Front). *From February to May 1942, he was commander of the Air Force of Kalinin Front. *From May 1942 to May 1943, he took command of the 3rd Air Army. *From May 1943 to June 1944, he was commander of the 1st Air Army. *From 1944 to 1946, Gromov was head of the Main Department of combat training of frontline aviation of the Air Force. After the war, Gromov was deputy commander of the Long-Range Aviation from 1946 to 1949. Later, till 1955, he was head of Department of flight service of Ministry of Aviation Industry. In 1955 he was discharged. From 1937 to 1946, Gromov was deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (1st convocation). In late 1940, he initiated the establishment of the Fedotov Test Pilot School. From 1959 to 1961, Gromov headed the Weightlifting Federation of USSR. Gromov lived in Moscow. Gromov's wife, Nina Georgievna Gromova (1922‚Äì2019), was an equestrian sportswoman. He is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery.

He was a member of the U.S. team at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship. Youth Warren attended William Fremd High School where he was a Parade Magazine High School All American. He began his college soccer career at Indiana University, where he played in 1999. After his freshman season, Warren transferred to Clemson, where he emerged as one of the best goalkeepers in the NCAA. Named first team All-ACC all three years at Clemson, Warren was named a first team All-American as a senior in 2002, as he helped the Tigers to the Elite Eight. In 2001, Warren was on the roster of the U.S. U-20 national team at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship.2001 U-20 World Cup Beginning in 2002, he began playing with the U.S. U-23 national team as it prepared for the 2004 Summer Olympic qualification campaign. Professional Following his senior season, Warren was drafted 14th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United. A reserve for much of the year, Warren was forced into action late in the season when starter Nick Rimando suffered a season-ending ACL injury. Warren started the season's last five regular season games and both their playoff games, and although he impressed, failed to win a game. In 2004, Warren again found himself as a backup to Rimando. However, shortly into the season, a string of mediocre performances by Rimando led Peter Nowak to give Warren another opportunity to seize the starting position. Warren started only one game, however, a loss in which he surrendered three goals, before being replaced again by rookie Troy Perkins. Perkins impressed enough to earn the starting job, and Warren was released soon thereafter. He spent the rest of the season with the New England Revolution, as an injury replacement for the injured Adin Brown. The Revolution acquired him for good after the season. He spent 2005 behind Matt Reis, making two appearances. Due to the consistency of Reis, Warren did not appear in MLS play in 2006 or 2007, although he remained the Revolution's second-choice keeper.

Belle was one of the leading sluggers of his time, and in 1995 became the only player to ever hit 50 doubles and 50 home runs in a season. He was also the first player to break the $10 million per year compensation contract in Major League Baseball. Belle was a model of consistency, compiling a .295 career batting average and averaging 37 home runs and 120 RBIs per season between 1991 and 2000. Belle is one of only six players in MLB history to have nine consecutive 100-RBI seasons. Early life Albert and his fraternal twin, Terry, were born on August 25, 1966, in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of Albert Belle Sr., a high school baseball and football coach, and Carrie Belle, a former math teacher. He attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. Belle attended Huntington High School in Shreveport, where he was a star baseball and football player, a member of the National Honor Society and vice president of the local Future Business Leaders of America. He graduated sixth in his high school class and made the all-state baseball team twice. In 1984, he was selected to play for the USA in the Junior Olympics, in which the U.S. won a silver medal. He played outfield and pitched, winning one game. After graduation, Belle was offered an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. However, Belle decided to stay close to home, and accepted a baseball scholarship to Louisiana State University. College Belle played college baseball at Louisiana State University from 1985 to 1987, where he made 1st team All-SEC in 1986 and 1987 and played in 184 games, with 585 at bats, 194 hits, 30 doubles, 49 home runs, 172 runs batted in, 157 runs, a .670 slugging percentage, and a .332 batting average. In 1986, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Chatham A's, then returned to the league in 1987 to play for the Hyannis Mets. After college, he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians. Major League career Belle became the fourth player to have eight straight seasons of 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, joining Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx and Lou Gehrig (a feat since matched by Albert Pujols, Rafael Palmeiro, Manny Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez). He was an accomplished baserunner, with a career high 23 steals in 1993, and 17 steals in 1999 despite hip problems. He led the league three times in RBIs, three times in total bases, three times in extra-base hits and twice in slugging. He was a five-time All-Star between 1993 and 1997. He had a powerful throwing arm, and was a gifted pitcher in high school. His range factor by games played was consistently higher than the major league average at that position; nevertheless, he still managed to accrue a -12.5 defensive WAR during 12 major league seasons. Belle's career highs in home runs, RBIs, batting average, runs scored and walks occurred in five separate seasons. In 2006, the Hardball Times published a statistical comparison of Belle's career statistics with that of 60 of his current and former peers. The article ranked him in career \\"prime value\\", behind current Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner and recent inductee Frank Thomas. In 1994, Belle lost the batting title to New York Yankees outfielder Paul O'Neill, .359 to .357. In 1995, Belle became the first player in major league history to hit 50 home runs and 50 doubles in the same season; the last player before him to reach as many as 40 in both categories had been Willie Stargell in 1973. The achievement was especially impressive because Belle played only 143 games in 1995 due to a season shortened by the previous year's player strike. Belle's reputation and disdain of the media cost him votes for the 1995 MVP Award. He finished second in the voting to the Boston Red Sox' Mo Vaughn even though he led the American League that season in runs scored, home runs, RBIs, slugging percentage and total bases, and outpaced Vaughn head-to-head in every important offensive category except RBIs (both men had 126); both players' teams reached the playoffs. This was in the middle of a three-year streak in which Belle finished 3rd, 2nd and 3rd for the American League MVP. Belle had two other top ten MVP finishes, in 1993 (7th) and 1998 (8th). In the winter of 1996, Belle signed a 5-year, $55 million ($ today) deal with the Chicago White Sox as a free agent. This contract made him the highest paid player in baseball for a brief period and the first player in baseball history to make $10 million in a season. He enjoyed two great seasons in Chicago, including a career-high 27-game hitting streak in May 1997, and came close to another 50/50 season in 1998 with 49 home runs (a White Sox team record that still stands) and 48 doubles. He also drove in 152 runs to break Zeke Bonura's single-season franchise record of 138 in 1936 (to date, the RBI total also remains a White Sox single-season record). Additionally, when Cal Ripken, Jr. ended his record consecutive game streak at 2,632 in September 1998 on the last day of the season, it was Belle who took over as the major leagues' active leader in the category. Belle's contract with the White Sox had an unusual clause allowing him to demand that he would remain one of the three highest paid players in baseball. In October 1998 he invoked the clause, and when the White Sox declined to give him a raise he immediately became a free agent. He again became the game's highest paid player, signing a five- year, $65 million ($ today) deal with the Baltimore Orioles. But his career ended just two seasons later when he was forced into retirement at age 34 by degenerative hip osteoarthritis. He was, however, kept on Baltimore's active 40-man roster for the next three years as a condition of the insurance policy which largely reimbursed the Orioles for the remainder of his contract. Belle homered in the final at-bat of his major-league career, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on October 1, 2000. =Controversies= In 1990, the Indians sent Belle to the Cleveland Clinic for two months for alcoholism rehabilitation. Belle was suspended in 1994 for using a corked bat, and gained further notoriety for sending teammate Jason Grimsley through the building's ceiling panel to break into the locked umpires' dressing room to retrieve his corked bat and substitute it with another teammate's bat, resulting in a seven-game suspension. The revelation of Belle's use of corked bats was given more emphasis when Cleveland teammate Omar Vizquel wrote in his autobiography that it would be naive to suggest otherwise and that \\"all of Albert's bats were corked.\\" He was fined in 1996 for knocking down Brewers infielder Fernando Vi√±a, who had blocked his way between bases. Sports reporters resented Belle's refusal to grant interviews before a game. A profane outburst directed at a group of reporters in his team's dugout, including NBC Sports personality Hannah Storm, was widely reported during the 1995 World Series. He was unrepentant afterward: \\"The Indians wanted me to issue a statement of regret when the fine was announced, but I told them to take it out. I apologize for nothing.\\" Eventually, Belle routinely refused to speak with the media. \\"I don't get excited talking about myself\\", he explained. \\"Guys such as Sandy Koufax, Joe DiMaggio and Steve Carlton did not interview, and it was no big deal. They were quiet. I am also quiet. I just want to concentrate on baseball. Why does everyone want to hear me talk, anyway?\\" But the media did not ignore him. Buster Olney, then of The New York Times, would write about his outbursts as a Cleveland Indian: :It was a taken in baseball circles that Albert Belle was nuts... The Indians billed him $10,000 a year for the damage he caused in clubhouses on the road and at home, and tolerated his behavior only because he was an awesome slugger... He slurped coffee constantly and seemed to be on a perpetual caffeinated frenzy. Few escaped his wrath: on some days he would destroy the postgame buffet...launching plates into the shower... after one poor at-bat against Boston, he retreated to the visitors' clubhouse and took a bat to teammate Kenny Lofton's boombox. Belle preferred to have the clubhouse cold, below 60 degrees, and when one chilly teammate turned up the heat, Belle walked over, turned down the thermostat and smashed it with his bat. His nickname, thereafter, was \\"Mr. Freeze.\\" In 2001, following his retirement, the New York Daily News' columnist Bill Madden wrote: :Sorry, there'll be no words of sympathy here for Albert Belle. He was a surly jerk before he got hurt and now he's a hurt surly jerk....He was no credit to the game. Belle's boorish behavior should be remembered by every member of the Baseball Writers' Association when it comes time to consider him for the Hall of Fame. In his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility (2006), he garnered only 7.7% of the baseball writers' votes, missing election by an extremely wide margin. But his vote total was high enough to keep his name on the ballot for the following year. In 2007, however, he garnered only 19 votes (3.5%). In retirement, Belle had his first encounter with the Cleveland Indians since leaving the club in 1996, during their 2012 spring training in Goodyear, Arizona and was joined by former teammates Kenny Lofton, Sandy Alomar, Jr., and Carlos Baerga. Belle has had a chilly relationship with the Indians franchise during his retirement. He declined to attend the 20th anniversary celebration of the 1995 World Series team and he declined to attend the ceremony when he was inducted into the Indians team Hall of Fame. Legal troubles In October 1995, Belle's house in Euclid, Ohio was egged after turning away trick-or-treaters on Halloween. Belle chased one of the trick-or-treaters in his car. Belle was fined $100 for reckless operation of a vehicle. The guardian of the teenager sued Belle for $850,000 contending that Belle's car bumped into the teenager. The lawsuit was settled in 1997. In 2006, Belle was sentenced to 90 days in jail and five years' probation after he admitted to stalking his former girlfriend. On March 25, 2018, Belle was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona and charged with indecent exposure and DUI. All charges were dismissed the following month.

Scott is now assistant coach of the North Carolina Courage soccer team, having followed head coach Paul Riley from the Portland Thorns FC to Western New York Flash and the Courage. Career =College= Vallow played college soccer at Bowling Green from 1995 to 1998, where he started all 85 games the team played during his tenure, amassing a .70 goals against average during his career. Vallow, alongside teammate Steve Klein, led Bowling Green to the \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" of the NCAA Championships in both 1995 and 1996. =Professional= Upon graduating, Vallow was signed to a Project-40 contract with Major League Soccer, for the express purpose of playing goalkeeper for the league's USL A-League affiliate. Although he was allocated to the Dallas Burn in August 1999, he saw no time for the team, and was released after the 1999 season.http://www.mlssoccer.com/content/rapids-sign-goalkeeper-scott- vallow Vallow then signed a contract with the Rochester Raging Rhinos, and immediately took hold of the starting position. Vallow's excellent play helped lead the Rhinos to the 2000 championship, and also resulted in his being named the A-League Goalkeeper of the Year. Vallow returned to the Rhinos in 2001, and his performance was integral in the team winning a second consecutive A-League Championship. Vallow spent the 2002 season shuttling between the USL and MLS, as he was signed and released by both the New England Revolution and the Dallas Burn; Vallow also played for the Rhinos, making eight appearances and sharing duties with Pat Onstad. Following the 2002 season, Vallow finally made a more permanent move up to the first division, being signed by the Colorado Rapids; although he was with the team for two years, Vallow was employed largely as a backup to Scott Garlick and then Joe Cannon. Vallow played in only four games during his two years with the team. He re-signed with the Rhinos after the 2004 MLS season, where he was the number one keeper, team captain, and fan favorite, announced on the pitch with the \\"Superman\\" theme playing at every home game. On October 20, 2009 Vallow extended his contract with the Rhinos for another 2 years.Rhinos re-sign Vallow However, he would announce his retirement after only one year, in January 2011, choosing to focus on being an assistant coach for the Western New York Flash of Women's Professional Soccer. =Coaching= Vallow remained an assistant coach of the Flash through the tenure of Flash head coach Aaran Lines, his former Rochester Rhinos teammate, until the end of the team's inaugural National Women's Soccer League season in 2013. Vallow began dating Flash midfielder McCall Zerboni, left the Flash, and became an assistant coach of the Rochester Rhinos in 2014. However, in 2015 the Flash traded Zerboni to Portland Thorns FC. The Thorns were coached by Paul Riley at the time, and Riley also hired Vallow to join the Thorns' staff as an assistant. Vallow then followed RIley back to Western New York when Riley was dismissed by Portland at the end of the 2015 season and subsequently hired by the Flash in 2016. (Portland traded Zerboni to the Boston Breakers before the 2016 season, and Boston traded her back to the Flash mid-season.) In 2016, Vallow managed the team whenever Riley was suspended by officials, which occurred three times during the 2016 season, including most of the team's 2016 semi-finals match against Portland Thorns FC, the entirety of the 2016 NWSL Championship match, and the 2017 NWSL season opener. Vallow himself was ejected during the Courage's May 27, 2017 match against the Chicago Red Stars. Personal life As of October 2016, Vallow was engaged to Western New York Flash midfielder McCall Zerboni. Vallow and Zerboni had to change plans to marry in October when the Flash reached the 2016 NWSL Championship match, also in October. Vallow and Zerboni own a home together in Portland, Oregon.

Background As early as August 1870, the Prussian 3rd Army led by Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia (the future Emperor Frederick III), had been marching towards Paris. The army was recalled to deal with French forces accompanied by Napoleon III. These forces were crushed at the Battle of Sedan, and the road to Paris was left open. Personally leading the Prussian forces, King William I of Prussia, along with his chief of staff Helmuth von Moltke, took the 3rd Army and the new Prussian Army of the Meuse under Crown Prince Albert of Saxony, and marched on Paris virtually unopposed. In Paris, the Governor and commander-in-chief of the city's defenses, General Louis Jules Trochu, assembled a force of 60,000 regular soldiers who had managed to escape from Sedan under Joseph Vinoy or who were gathered from depot troops. Together with 90,000 Mobiles (Territorials), a brigade of 13,000 naval seamen and 350,000 National Guards, the potential defenders of Paris totaled around 513,000. The compulsorily enrolled National Guards were, however, untrained. They had 2,150 cannon plus 350 in reserve, and 8,000,000 kg of gunpowder. Siege The Prussian armies quickly reached Paris, and on 15 September Moltke issued orders for the investment of the city. Crown Prince Albert's army closed in on Paris from the north unopposed, while Crown Prince Frederick moved in from the south. On 17 September a force under Vinoy attacked Frederick's army near Villeneuve-Saint-Georges in an effort to save a supply depot there, but it was eventually driven back by artillery fire. The railroad to Orl√©ans was cut, and on the 18th Versailles was taken, and then served as the 3rd Army's and eventually Wilhelm's headquarters. By 19 September the encirclement was complete, and the siege officially began. Responsible for the direction of the siege was General (later Field Marshal) von Blumenthal. Prussia's chancellor Otto von Bismarck suggested shelling Paris to ensure the city's quick surrender and render all French efforts to free the city pointless, but the German high command, headed by the king of Prussia, turned down the proposal on the insistence of General von Blumenthal, on the grounds that a bombardment would affect civilians, violate the rules of engagement, and turn the opinion of third parties against the Germans, without speeding up the final victory. It was also contended that a quick French surrender would leave the new French armies undefeated and allow France to renew the war shortly after. The new French armies would have to be annihilated first, and Paris would have to be starved into surrender. A company of the French National Guards Trochu had little faith in the ability of the National Guards, which made up half the force defending the city. So instead of making any significant attempt to prevent the investment by the Germans, Trochu hoped that Moltke would attempt to take the city by storm, and the French could then rely on the city's defenses. These consisted of the Thiers wall and a ring of sixteen detached forts, all of which had been built in the 1840s. Moltke never had any intention of attacking the city and this became clear shortly after the siege began. Trochu changed his plan and allowed Vinoy to make a demonstration against the Prussians west of the Seine. On 30 September Vinoy attacked Chevilly with 20,000 soldiers and was soundly repulsed by the 3rd Army. Then on 13 October the II Bavarian Corps was driven from Ch√¢tillon but the French were forced to retire in face of Prussian artillery. \\"The War: Defence of Paris‚ÄîStudents Going to Man the Fortifications\\". From the Illustrated London News of 1 October 1870; perhaps one of the more iconic scenes from the Franco-Prussian War. General Carey de Bellemare commanded the strongest fortress north of Paris at Saint Denis. On 29 October de Bellemare attacked the Prussian Guard at Le Bourget without orders, and took the town. The Guard actually had little interest in recapturing their positions at Le Bourget, but Crown Prince Albert ordered the city retaken anyway. In the battle of Le Bourget the Prussian Guards succeeded in retaking the city and captured 1,200 French soldiers. Upon hearing of the French surrender at Metz and the defeat at Le Bourget, morale in Paris began to sink. The people of Paris were beginning to suffer from the effects of the German blockade. Hoping to boost morale on 30 November Trochu launched the largest attack from Paris even though he had little hope of achieving a breakthrough. Nevertheless, he sent Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot with 80,000 soldiers against the Prussians at Champigny, Cr√©teil and Villiers. In what became known as the battle of Villiers the French succeeded in capturing and holding a position at Cr√©teil and Champigny. By 2 December the W√ºrttemberg Corps had driven Ducrot back into the defenses and the battle was over by 3 December. Balloons escaped from the siege of Paris The Louis Blanc, piloted by Eug√®ne Farcot, was the 10th ballon mont√© (balloon mail) of the 66 sent during the siege. On 19 January a final breakout attempt was aimed at the Ch√¢teau of Buzenval in Rueil-Malmaison near the Prussian Headquarters, west of Paris. The Crown Prince easily repulsed the attack inflicting over 4,000 casualties while suffering just over 600. Trochu resigned as governor and left General Joseph Vinoy with 146,000 defenders. During the winter, tensions began to arise in the Prussian high command. Field-Marshal Helmuth von Moltke and General Leonhard, Count von Blumenthal who commanded the siege (seen in the illustration on this page behind Bismarck's right shoulder) were primarily concerned with a methodical siege that would destroy the detached forts around the city and slowly strangle the defending forces with a minimum of German casualties. Prussian artillery during the siege But as time wore on, there was growing concern that a prolonged war was placing too much strain on the German economy and that an extended siege would convince the French Government of National Defense that Prussia could still be beaten. A prolonged campaign would also allow France time to reconstitute a new army and convince neutral powers to enter the war against Prussia. To Bismarck, Paris was the key to breaking the power of the intransigent republican leaders of France, ending the war in a timely manner, and securing peace terms favourable to Prussia. Moltke was also worried that insufficient winter supplies were reaching the German armies investing the city, as diseases such as tuberculosis were breaking out amongst the besieging soldiers. In addition, the siege operations competed with the demands of the ongoing Loire Campaign against the remaining French field armies. In January, on Bismarck's advice, the Germans fired some 12,000 shells into the city over 23 nights in an attempt to break Parisian morale. About 400 perished or were wounded by the bombardment which, \\"had little effect on the spirit of resistance in Paris.\\" Delescluze declared, \\"The Frenchmen of 1870 are the sons of those Gauls for whom battles were holidays.\\" Due to a severe shortage of food, Parisians were forced to slaughter whatever animals were at hand. Rats, dogs, cats, and horses were the first to be slaughtered and became regular fare on restaurant menus. Once the supply of those animals ran low, the citizens of Paris turned on the zoo animals residing at Jardin des plantes. Even Castor and Pollux, the only pair of elephants in Paris, were slaughtered for their meat. A Christmas menu, 99th day of the siege. Unusual dishes include stuffed donkey's head, elephant consomm√©, roast camel, kangaroo stew, antelope terrine, bear ribs, cat with rats, and wolf haunch in deer sauce. A Latin Quarter menu contemporary with the siege reads in part: : * Consomm√© de cheval au millet. (horse) : * Brochettes de foie de chien √† la ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel. (dog) : * Eminc√© de rable de chat. Sauce mayonnaise. (cat) : * Epaules et filets de chien brais√©s. Sauce aux tomates. (dog) : * Civet de chat aux champignons. (cat) : * C√¥telettes de chien aux petits pois. (dog) : * Salamis de rats. Sauce Robert. (rats) : * Gigots de chien flanqu√©s de ratons. Sauce poivrade. (dog, rats) : * Begonias au jus. (flowers) : * Plum-pudding au rhum et √† la Moelle de Cheval. (horse) Air medical transport is often stated to have first occurred in 1870 during the siege of Paris when 160 wounded French soldiers were evacuated from the city by hot-air balloon, but this myth has been definitively disproven by full review of the crew and passenger records of each balloon which left Paris during the siege. Elihu B. Washburne During the siege, the only head of diplomatic mission from a major power who remained in Paris was United States Minister to France, Elihu B. Washburne. As a representative of a neutral country, Washburne was able to play a unique role in the conflict, becoming one of the few channels of communication into and out of the city for much of the siege. He also led the way in providing humanitarian relief to foreign nationals, including ethnic Germans. On 25 January 1871, Wilhelm I overruled Moltke and ordered the field-marshal to consult with Bismarck for all future operations. Bismarck immediately ordered the city to be bombarded with large- caliber Krupp siege guns. This prompted the city's surrender on 28 January 1871. Paris sustained more damage in the 1870‚Äì1871 siege than in any other conflict. Armistice and surrender German parade through Paris Secret armistice discussions began on January 23, 1871 and continued at Versailles between Jules Favre and Bismarck until the 27th. On the French side there was concern that the National Guard would rebel when news of the capitulation became public. Bismarck's advice was \\"provoke an uprising, then, while you still have an army with which to suppress it\\". The final terms agreed on were that the French regular troops (less one division) would be disarmed, Paris would pay an indemnity of two hundred million francs, and the fortifications around the perimeter of the city would be surrendered. In return the armistice was extended until February 19. Food supplies from the provinces, as well as shiploads from Britain and the United States, began to enter the starving city almost immediately. Thirty thousand Prussian, Bavarian and Saxon troops held a brief victory parade in Paris on March 1, 1871 and Bismarck honored the armistice by sending trainloads of food into the city. The German troops departed after two days to take up temporary encampments to the east of the city, to be withdrawn from there when France paid the agreed war indemnity. While Parisians scrubbed the streets \\"polluted\\" by the triumphal entry, no serious incidents occurred during the short and symbolic occupation of the city. This was in part because the Germans had avoided areas such as Belleville, where hostility was reportedly high.  Air mail  Puvis de Chavannes. The companion painting in the Mus√©e d'Orsay depicts a balloon. Balloon mail was the only means by which communications from the besieged city could reach the rest of France. The use of balloons to carry mail was first proposed by the photographer and balloonist Felix Nadar, who had established the grandiosely titled No. 1 Compagnie des A√©rostatiers, with a single balloon, the Neptune, at its disposal, to perform tethered ascents for observation purposes. However the Prussian encirclement of the city made this pointless, and on 17 September Nadar wrote to the Council for the Defence of Paris proposing the use of balloons for communication with the outside world: a similar proposal had also been made by the balloonist Eug√®ne Godard. The first balloon launch was carried out on 23 September, using the Neptune, and carried of mail in addition to the pilot. After a three-hour flight it landed at Craconville from Paris. Following this success a regular mail service was established, with a rate of 20 centimes per letter. Two workshops to manufacture balloons were set up, one under the direction of Nadar in the Elys·ªÅe-Montmartre dance-hall (later moved to the Gare du Nord), and the other under the direction of Godard in the Gare d'Orleans. Around 66 balloon flights were made, including one that accidentally set a world distance record by ending up in Norway. The vast majority of these succeeded: only five were captured by the Prussians, and three went missing, presumably coming down in the Atlantic or Irish Sea. The number of letters carried has been estimated at around 2.5 million. The departure of Leon Gambetta Some balloons also carried passengers in addition to the cargo of mail, most notably L√©on Gambetta, the minister for War in the new government, who was flown out of Paris on 7 October. The balloons also carried homing pigeons out of Paris to be used for a pigeon post. This was the only means by which communications from the rest of France could reach the besieged city. A specially laid telegraph cable on the bed of the Seine had been discovered and cut by the Prussians on 27 September, couriers attempting to make their way through the German lines were almost all intercepted and although other methods were tried including attempts to use balloons, dogs and message canisters floated down the Seine, these were all unsuccessful. The pigeons were taken to their base, first at Tours and later at Poitiers, and when they had been fed and rested were ready for the return journey. Tours lies some from Paris and Poitiers some distant. Before release, they were loaded with their dispatches. Initially the pigeon post was only used for official communications but on 4 November the government announced that members of the public could send messages, these being limited to twenty words at a charge of 50 centimes per word. The Siege of Paris by Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier. Oil on canvas. These were then copied onto sheets of cardboard and photographed by a M. Barreswille, a photographer based in Tours. Each sheet contained 150 messages and was reproduced as a print about in size: each pigeon could carry nine of these. The photographic process was further refined by Ren√© Dagron to allow more to be carried: Dagron, with his equipment, was flown out of Paris on 12 November in the aptly named Ni√©pce, narrowly escaping capture by the Prussians. The photographic process allowed multiple copies of the messages to be sent, so that although only 57 of the 360 pigeons released reached Paris more than 60,000 of the 95,000 messages sent were delivered. (some sources give a considerably higher figure of around 150,000 official and 1 million private communications, but this figure is arrived at by counting all copies of each message.) Aftermath On 18 January 1871 the German Empire is proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles, painted by Anton von Werner. Late in the siege, Wilhelm I was proclaimed German Emperor on 18 January 1871 at the Palace of Versailles. The kingdoms of Bavaria, W√ºrttemberg, and Saxony, the states of Baden and Hesse, and the free cities of Hamburg and Bremen were unified with the North German Confederation to create the German Empire. The preliminary peace treaty was signed at Versailles, and the final peace treaty, the Treaty of Frankfurt, was signed on 10 May 1871. Otto von Bismarck was able to secure Alsace-Lorraine as part of the German Empire. The continued presence of German troops outside the city angered Parisians. Further resentment arose against the French government, and in March 1871 Parisian workers and members of the National Guard rebelled and established the Paris Commune, a radical and socialist government, which lasted through late May of that year. In popular culture Empires of Sand by David W. Ball (Bantam Dell, 1999) is a novel in two parts, the first of which is set during the Franco-Prussian war, more particularly the Siege of Paris during the winter of 1870-71. Key elements of the siege, including the hot-air balloons used for reconnaissance and messages, the tunnels beneath the city, the starvation and the cold, combine to render a vivid impression of war-time Paris before its surrender. The Old Wives' Tale by Arnold Bennett is a novel which follows the fortunes of two sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines. The latter runs away to make a disastrous marriage in France, where after being abandoned by her husband, she lives through the Siege of Paris and the Commune. Elusive Liberty is a novel by Glen Davies. It follows the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty, Major Auguste Bartholdi, who fought against the German invaders as an aide-de-camp to General Garibaldi and is in Paris during the siege.http://www.whiteswanpress.com The King in Yellow, a short story collection by Robert W. Chambers, published in 1895, includes a story titled \\"The Street of the First Shell\\" which takes place over a few days of the siege. Woman of the Commune (1895, AKA A Girl of the Commune) by G. A. Henty, also published in 1895, spans the Prussian siege and the ensuing events of the Paris Commune. The Master, a 2012 film by Paul Thomas Anderson, alludes to the Siege when Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) tells Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) that they both were part of the pigeon post.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as a U.S. Representative and subsequently as a U.S. Senator. Early life Cotton was born on a farm in Warren, New Hampshire, and was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and Wesleyan University in Connecticut. While in college, he served as a clerk to the New Hampshire State Senate. He also served as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1923 as one of the youngest legislators in history. He became a lawyer after attending The George Washington University Law School and practiced law in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Career Cotton was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives again in 1943, and served as majority leader that year and as Speaker from 1945 to 1947. In 1946, Cotton was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district for the first time. He served until 1954, when he ran for a seat in the United States Senate from New Hampshire in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of incumbent Senator Charles W. Tobey. He was elected to a full term in 1956, reelected twice and served in the Senate until 1975. Cotton voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, but against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and was the only New England senator do so.

Three days before his final term ran out, Cotton resigned to allow the governor to appoint Louis C. Wyman. Cotton returned to the Senate in August 1975 after the election of his successor was contested. The closest Senate election in history, it went through two recounts at the state level, followed by protracted debate on the Senate floor, until both candidates agreed to a special election. Cotton served as a temporary senator until the September 1975 special election, the result of which was not challenged; Cotton returned to Lebanon, New Hampshire. Cotton was the last senator to return to the senate via appointment for 43 years until Arizona's former Senator Jon Kyl was appointed by Governor Doug Ducey in 2018 following the death of Senator John McCain. Death and legacy Cotton died on February 24, 1989, in Lebanon, aged 88. He is interred at School Street Cemetery in Lebanon. The Norris Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth- Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon is named for him, and a federal building in Manchester also bears his name.

History Graceland University was established as Graceland College in 1895 by the RLDS Church in Lamoni, Iowa. Land for the college was donated by church members, with the first 20 acres given by Marietta Walker. The name \\"Graceland\\" was selected by Col. George Barrett, land surveyor for the college, for the graceful slope of the hill upon which the college was built. Until the administration building was completed, classes were conducted in a building in downtown Lamoni. The first day of classes was September 17, 1895. In 1917, Graceland received accreditation from the states of Iowa and Missouri and from the North Central Association of Colleges, making it the first fully accredited junior college in Iowa. Graceland became a four-year college in 1960. Graceland's nursing program began in 1910 as a cooperative program with the Independence Sanitarium and Hospital, Independence, MO. The Graceland campus was extended to Independence with the establishment of the college's bachelor's degree program in 1968-69.

Cheville Chapel at Graceland University, Lamoni, Iowa, dedicated 1978The Cheville Chapel was dedicated in 1978 in honor of Roy Cheville, theologian, educator and former Presiding Patriarch of the Community of Christ. The structure was built for $325,000 and was funded by a restricted private bequest. In keeping with the desire for the chapel to be an accessible place of solitude, Graceland's president Frank Hough determined that the facility should remain unstaffed and open at all times. The Chapel's relatively small seating capacity makes it an intimate setting for worship, theological education and the performance of sacred music. Known for its excellent acoustics, it has been used for small ensemble performances. It is used several times a week by campus groups for worship services, and as a place of individual prayer and reflection. Architecturally, the postmodern brick structure is minimalist in its design. It is reminiscent of the exterior simplicity of the Rothko Chapel in Houston built only a few years earlier, while its twin steeple foreshadows the deconstructivism style in architecture that began a decade later.

Treatment as an agricultural pest has led to its status as an endangered species. They are closely related to squirrels, chipmunks, and marmots. Cynomys mexicanus originated about 230,000 years ago from a peripherally isolated population of the more widespread Cynomys ludovicianus. Ecology These prairie dogs prefer to inhabit rock-free soil in plains at an altitude of . They are found in the regions of southern Coahuila and northern San Luis Potos√≠ in northern Mexico, where they eat herbs and grasses native to the plains where they live. They acquire all of their water from these plants. Although mainly herbivores, they have been known to eat insects. Predators include coyotes, bobcats, eagles, hawks, badgers, snakes, and weasels. Northern prairie dogs hibernate and have a shorter mating season, which generally lasts from January to April. After one month's gestation, females give birth to one litter per year, an average of four hairless pups. They are born with eyes closed and use their tails as visual aids until they can see, about 40 days after birth. Weaning occurs during late May and early June, when yearlings may break away from the burrow. Pups leave their mothers by fall. As they grow older, young play fighting games that involve biting, hissing, and tackling. They reach sexual maturity after one year, with a lifespan of 3‚Äì5 years; adults weigh about and are 14-17 inches long, and males are larger than females. Their coloring is yellowish, with darker ears and a lighter belly. Prairie dogs have one of the most sophisticated languages in the animal world‚Äîa system of high-pitched yips and barks‚Äîand can run up to . As a consequence, their defense mechanism is to sound the alarm, and then get away quickly. Mexican prairie dogs live in excavated colonies, referred to as \\"towns\\", which they dig for shelter and protection. A typical town has a funnel-like entrance that slants down into a corridor up to long, with side chambers for storage and nesting. It has been found that some chambers in these burrows serve specific purposes such as nurseries for new mothers and their young. Prairie dogs have strong muscles in their arms which allow them to dig through the often dense dirt of their habitats. They have even been found to use their teeth to dig, although this is less common. Towns can contain hundreds of animals, but generally have fewer than 50, with a single alpha male. Sometimes, spotted ground squirrels or burrowing owls share the burrow with its rightful owners. Population structure In 1956, the Mexican prairie dog was reported as occurring in Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and San Luis Potos√≠. By the 1980s, it had disappeared from Nuevo Le√≥n. As of 1992 its complete range was roughly 600 km2 (372 mi2). Viewed as a pest and an obstacle to agriculture and cattle raising, it was frequently poisoned, and became endangered in 1994. Mexican prairie dogs currently inhabit less than 4% of their former territory and suffered a 33% decrease in range between 1996 and 1999. The current habitat of Mexican prairie dogs is in the region known as El Tokio. These are the grasslands located in the convergence of the states of San Luis Potos√≠, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Coahuila. Conservation groups such as Pronatura Noreste and Profauna, with the help of donors, carry out conservation efforts for the protection of prairie dogs and associated species, such as shorebirds and birds of prey. Pronatura Noreste, as of February 2007, has signed conservation easements with ejidos and private owners for the protection of more than 42,000 acres (170 km2) of Mexican prairie dog grasslands.

Mushers pack up to of equipment and provisions for themselves and their dogs to survive between checkpoints. Each musher must rely on a single sled for the entire run, versus three in the Iditarod. Ten checkpoints and four dog drops, some more than apart, lie along the trail. Veterinarians are present at each to ensure the health and welfare of the dogs, give advice, and provide veterinary care for dropped dogs; together with the race marshal or a race judge, they may remove a dog or team from the race for medical or other reasons. There are only nine checkpoints for rest, versus 22 in the Iditarod. Mushers are permitted to leave dogs at checkpoints and dog drops, but not to replace them. Sleds may not be replaced (without penalty) and mushers cannot accept help from non- racers except at Dawson City, the halfway mark. The route runs on frozen rivers, over four mountain ranges, and through isolated northern villages. Racers cover or more. Temperatures commonly drop as low as , and winds can reach at higher elevations. Because it begins a month earlier than the Iditarod, the Quest is a colder race, and is run on shorter solar days and through longer, darker nights. Sonny Lindner won the inaugural race in 1984 from a field of 26 teams. The fastest run took place in 2010, when Hans Gatt finished after 9 days and 26 minutes. The 2012 competition had the closest one-two finish, as Hugh Neff beat Allen Moore by twenty-six seconds. In 2005, Lance Mackey became the first Yukon Quest rookie to win the race, a feat that was repeated by 2011's champion, Dallas Seavey. In 2007, Mackey became the first to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod, a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when Ty Halvorson took 20 days, 8 hours, and 29 minutes to finish. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle became the first woman to win the race, in 10 days, 22 hours, and 57 minutes. Yukon Quest International, which runs the Yukon Quest sled dog race, also runs two shorter races: the Junior Quest and the Yukon Quest 300 (previously the Yukon Quest 250).  History  The idea for the Yukon Quest originated in April 1983 during a bar-room discussion among four Alaskans: LeRoy Shank, Roger Williams, Ron Rosser, and William \\"Willy\\" Lipps.

They disdained the many checkpoints and stages of the Iditarod Sled Dog RaceFirth, p. 248 and envisioned an endurance race in which racers would rely on themselves and survival would be as important as speed. \\"We wanted more of a Bush experience, a race that would put a little woodsmanship into it\\", Shank said at the race's 25th anniversary. This remained a vague plan until August 1983, when the first public organizational meetings took place. Fundraising began, and the start date for the race was optimistically moved forward from February 1985 to February 25, 1984. The entry fee for the first race was $500, and Murray Clayton of Haines, Alaska became the first person to enter when he paid his fee in October 1983. In December 1983, the race was officially named the Yukon Quest.Staff report. \\"Looking back in Fairbanks ‚Äî Dec. 22\\", Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. December 22, 2008. Accessed May 14, 2009. Two more months of planning followed, and a crew of volunteers was organized to staff the checkpoints and place trail markers. On February 25, 1984, 26 racers left Fairbanks for Whitehorse. Each team was limited to a maximum of 12 dogs, and racers had to finish with no fewer than nine. They also had to haul of food per dog ( total) to cover the long distances between checkpoints. Numerous problems occurred in the first race. The leading mushers had to break trail because the snowmobile intended for the task broke down. Trail markers often were absent or misplaced, and no preparations had been made for racers in Dawson City until organizer Roger Williams flew there shortly after the race began. After Dawson City, mushers had their dogs and sleds trucked to avoid a section of snowless trail, then had to deal with open sections of the Yukon River near Whitehorse due to above-average temperatures. The eventual winner of the inaugural race, Sonny Lindner, was greeted with little fanfare on his arrival. On the race's 25th anniversary, he recalled, \\"I think it was 90 percent (camping) trip and maybe a little bit of racing.\\" Saari, Matias. \\"1984\\" , Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. February 6, 2008.

From Pelly Crossing, mushers travel west on the frozen Pelly River, or on a road that parallels the river if ice conditions are poor. At Stepping Stone, shortly before the Pelly and Yukon rivers meet, they can rest at a hospitality stop before turning north.Killick, p. 133 From Stepping Stone to Scroggie Creek the trail consists of a mining road or \\"cat\\" road, named for the Caterpillar tracked mining vehicles that use it. Before organizers coordinated schedules with the mining equipment operators, racers often had to contend with heavy machinery blocking the trail or turning it into a muddy path.Firth, pp. 140‚Äì144 The Scroggie Creek dog drop is at the confluence of the Stewart River and Scroggie Creek.Killick, pp. 140‚Äì141 After Scroggie Creek, the trail switches from a westerly direction to almost directly north.

Racers exit Dawson City on the Yukon River and follow it for about to the Fortymile River hospitality stop. The river's name comes from its distance from Fort Reliance, an abandoned trading post established in 1874.Killick, p. 173 From the hospitality stop, mushers travel southwest on the Fortymile River in what is one of the coldest portions of the race, because of cold air sinking to the bottom of the river valley.Killick, p. 186 The trail on the river crosses the United States‚ÄìCanada border, noticeable only because of the border vista, a strip of land cleared of all foliage.Killick, p. 192 Shortly past the border, the river turns northwest, and mushers leave its frozen surface when it meets the Taylor Highway, a road closed to automobile traffic during the winter.

During this stretch, two hospitality stops are available. The first is from Eagle at Trout Creek.Killick, p. 217 The next is Biederman's Cabin, the former home of Charlie Biederman, one of the last people to deliver mail by sled dog.

(Circle is actually about south of that line.)Killick, p. 233 From Circle, it is to the checkpoint in Central. Mushers follow Birch Creek south until just before Circle Hot Springs. This area, along with the Fortymile stretch, is considered among the coldest on the trail, and mushers are advised to prepare for temperatures. Turning west, they travel through frozen swamps before reaching the Steese Roadhouse checkpoint in Central.Killick, p. 238 In Central during even years, mushers have the option of taking their four-hour rest here or at Mile 101. If they choose to, the three minute start difference will be subtracted from their rest time. = Central to Two Rivers = Steese Roadhouse, seen here in summer, is home to the Central checkpoint of the Yukon Quest. From Central to the final (or first, in the Fairbanks‚ÄìWhitehorse direction) checkpoint in Two Rivers is . Despite the comparative closeness of the checkpoints and the location of a dog drop between them, this is considered the most difficult stretch of dog sled trail in the world.Killick, p. 246 At this point, mushers must climb the two steepest and most difficult mountains on the trail: Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit. After leaving Central, mushers head west, paralleling the Steese Highway, which connects Central and Circle with Fairbanks. The trail travels through frozen swamps, mining areas, and firebreaks for about . Mushers then encounter the Steese Highway for a second time before crossing several creeks to begin the ascent of Eagle Summit. They eventually climb above the tree line and are exposed to the wind as they continue upward. The weather atop Eagle Summit is harsh as this is a convergence zone between the Yukon Flats to the north and the low ground of the Tanana Valley to the south. A differential in the weather within the two valleys causes high winds and precipitation when there is moisture in the atmosphere.Balzar, p. 253 The final few hundred yards of the climb consists of a 30-degree slope often scoured to bare rock and tundra by the fierce wind.Balzar, pp. 252‚Äì254 The crossing point itself is a symmetrical saddle, with two peaks of similar height separated by .Killick, pp. 246‚Äì247 The south side of Eagle Summit is not as steep, and mushers generally have an easier time reaching the checkpoint at Mile 101. When descending the steep northern slope of Eagle Summit on the Fairbanks‚ÄìWhitehorse route, many mushers wrap their sled runners in chains to increase friction and slow the plunge.Killick, p. 249 The eastern slope of Eagle Summit, seen in August 2008 looking north The Mile 101 checkpoint is a cabin at mile marker 101 (the distance from Fairbanks) on the Steese Highway. At Mile 101, mushers have the option of taking their four-hour rest during even years. They can also take the rest at Central during even years. Again, the three minute start difference will be subtracted from the race if the musher desires to take their rest here. The cabin gives mushers the opportunity for a short rest between Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit.Killick, p. 254 The ascent of Rosebud Summit begins about south of the dog drop. It consists of a gradual climb of followed by a steep descent into the valley that contains the north fork of the Chena River. The descent also brings mushers back into forested terrain.Killick, p. 256 The trail then parallels a road for about before entering the final checkpoint at Twin Bears Campground near Two Rivers. = Two Rivers to Fairbanks = Twin Bears Campground, seen here in spring, was the Two Rivers checkpoint in the 2009 race. Two Rivers is the final checkpoint in the Whitehorse‚ÄìFairbanks route. Mushers are required to rest at least eight hours in Two Rivers in odd years to ensure the health of their dogs during the final leg of the race. The terrain in this stretch is among the easiest on the trail, with gently rolling hills and forest which gradually change into an urban landscape as racers approach Fairbanks.Killick, p. 261 The greatest challenge for racers in the Two Rivers area is distinguishing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled dog trails, many of which have similar markings.Balzar, p. 276 Mushers have occasionally been deceived by these markings and taken wrong turns.O'Donoghue, p. 312 Beyond Two Rivers, the trail reaches the Chena River northwest of Fairbanks. This is the final stretch, and mushers use the river to enter Fairbanks and reach the finish line,Killick, p. 262 which is on the river itself in the middle of downtown Fairbanks. Regardless of the timing of the finish, several thousand spectators typically gather to watch the first musher cross the finish line. The Fairbanks start/finish line at the start of the 2008 Yukon Quest = Route changes = The 1984 route was slightly different from today's. It had just one non-checkpoint dog drop, at the Mile 101 location,Firth, p. 237 and bypassed American Summit, Pelly Junction, and Braeburn. Instead of running through Braeburn, mushers traveled across Lake Laberge for between Whitehorse and Minto.Firth, p. 279 The inaugural race also included a checkpoint at Chena Hot Springs Resort near Fairbanks. This site was moved to nearby Angel Creek after mushers complained that the hot springs melted nearby snow, causing their dogs to become wet‚Äîan extreme hazard in sub-freezing temperatures.Firth, p. 19 Two additional dog drops were added for the 1994 race: Biederman's Cabin (since replaced by Slaven's Cabin) and McCabe Creek. In 1995, the Whitehorse end of the trail was moved away from Lake Laberge to near the Takhini River.Firth, pp. 237‚Äì238 Additional changes that year included the rerouting of the trail around the southern and eastern sides of King Solomon's Dome south of Dawson CityFirth, p. 238 and the introduction of the Scroggie Creek dog drop site on the shore of the Stewart River. In 1996, the trail was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a checkpoint was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch was replaced by a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson- Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks.Firth, p. 240 The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead.

One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself. = Entry requirements = Competitors must meet a series of written and unwritten requirements before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants have been known to lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt.Saari, Matias. \\"Jamaican musher prepares for Yukon Quest\\", Fairbanks Daily News-Miner.

Those who have completed at least of Quest-sanctioned racing are eligible to send in an entry form. This requires entrants to certify that they are older than 18, have not been censured by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and have never been convicted of animal abuse or neglect. They must pay $1,500 or $2,000 for late entries. = Dog health = Veterinarians, handlers, and mushers examine two dog teams after the 2009 Yukon Quest. Many of the Quest's rules are intended to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints. Mushers must start the race with at most fourteen dogs and finish with no fewer than six. Dogs are visually examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog whips and forced feeding are forbidden.2009 Yukon Quest Rules, p. 7 Participating dogs may not receive injections during the race or be under the influence of performance-enhancing substances such as steroids. The race marshal may remove any team from the race for violations of these rules or substandard dog care. = Penalties = The Yukon Quest's rules allow race officials latitude on whether to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations.2009 Yukon Quest Rules, p. 2 The most serious penalties can be assessed for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed. Saari, Matias. \\"Quest legend Turner scratches, leaving 22 mushers competing\\", Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. February 11, 2008. Accessed February 23, 2009. More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records. These minor penalties can have an effect on the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Circle Hot Springs road.

Yukon Quest International. \\"Other Yukon Quest races\\" , Yukonquest.com. Accessed February 23, 2009. The two began in 2000, though in its first three years the Quest 300 was only 250 miles and thus known as the Quest 250. = Junior Yukon Quest = The Junior Yukon Quest, or Junior Quest, is a race for mushers older than 14 but under 18. Staff Report. \\"Six mushers set to race in Jr. Quest\\", Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. February 7, 2009. Accessed February 23, 2009. Unlike the Yukon Quest, the Junior Quest does not change locations and always starts and ends in Fairbanks. It is billed as an opportunity for young racers to experience a mid-distance sled dog race. They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same equipment as mushers in the Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300. = Yukon Quest 300 = The Yukon Quest 300 is a race along the regular Yukon Quest trail. It alternates starting locations along with the main race and is intended for less-experienced mushers training for longer races. The race is also a qualifier for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and the following year's Yukon Quest. Several mushers, including Fort Yukon Native Josh Cadzow, have used the race as a trial before entering the longer races.

In Quebec, the program is known as Pari sportif; in Ontario and Atlantic Canada, it is known as Pro-Line while in British Columbia, it is known as Sports Action. However, the rules for the games are similar in all provinces. Initially created to offer betting primarily on the North American major professional sports leagues, Sport Select has expanded to offer betting on competitions such as the English Premier League and college sports. Sport Select (or equivalent) tickets can be purchased at all lottery centres across Canada, thus creating one of the most dense sports betting networks in the world. In addition, some provinces are now accepting wagers over the Internet. Sport Select games Each province offers versions of these three games under rules similar to those described below: =Pro-Line= Known as Oddset in British Columbia and Mise-O-Jeu in Quebec, Pro-Line offers fixed-odds sports betting, and is the most popular Sport Select game. It does not offer betting on individual matches, partly because betting on a single sporting event is illegal under the Criminal Code. Therefore, Pro-Line is a parlay game where bettors wager on the outcome of anywhere from two to six (BC and Atlantic) and three to six (Quebec, Ontario and Western Canada) of the matches offered by the lottery corporation. Decimal odds are quoted for individual matches, the odds for each selection being multiplied to calculate the potential payout of the ticket. For the ticket to pay out, all selections must be correct. Some provinces offer Combo Play which does not require all selections to be correct for a payout, but a Combo Play ticket is effectively nothing more than a number of similar, individual Pro-Line tickets rolled into one. Overtime is considered when determining results, but overtime in soccer is not. =Point spread= Point Spread is similar to those games offered by other bookmakers where bettors are wagering against a quoted point spread. Bettors can make predictions on the outcomes of two to twelve games, depending on the province. The payouts offered vary by province. =Over/Under= Also known as Total in Quebec, Over/Under is similar to those games offered by other bookmakers where bettors are wagering that the number of points scored in each match are over or under the quoted total. Bettors can make predictions on the outcomes of two to twelve games, depending on the province. The payouts offered vary by province. Controversy =Odds= In recent years, Sport Select has come under increasingly heavy criticism from Canadian gamblers due to the poor odds it offers (from the gambler's perspective). A private bookmaker licensed in the United Kingdom or Nevada generally maintains an overround (or \\"vig\\") of about 110%, meaning the bookmaker can expect to pay out $100 for every $110 that is wagered. In Canada, however, the overround for an individual match in Sport Select odds often exceeds 130%. To make matters worse for the bettor, the parlay requirement compounds the overround - the actual vigorish is a minimum of 160% but can climb to well over 300% (if six selections are made). In jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom where genuine competition is allowed, bookies often pay bonuses for winning parlay bets to help offset the compounded vig. Sport Select does not. Another controversial frustration for Pro-Line players in Atlantic Canada is the occurrence of Atlantic Lottery (ALC) 'capping' wagering on combinations and, on rare occasion, individual selections. This occurs when a significant amount of wagering is placed within a short span of time, typically on a specific combination of outcomes. The reasoning behind having such caps is to dissuade professional, or 'block', bettors from attempting to take advantage of potential flaws in the posted odds, and thus limits the liability for the corporation on a given combination of outcomes. Typical block betting behaviour involves placing large sums (often thousands of $) on a very small amount of combinations, trying to focus on perceived flaws as much as possible. Ultimately the Pro-Line game is meant to be recreational and not for professionals. Unlike online-only betting operations where all transactions must be submitted by identity verified accounts, Atlantic Lottery operates across a network of retailers where wagers are accepted anonymously, thus making it more susceptible to such 'block' bettors. The capping of combinations serves to limit pro-betting while keeping all outcomes open for betting, in any other combination. If a combination of outcomes is capped, any subsequent transaction submitted to the system attempting to wager on this particular combination is rejected. This can be an annoyance to non- professional (casual) bettors legitimately trying to wager on a capped combination, but experienced bettors have come to understand the reasoning and adjust their wagers accordingly. Though most experts agree that the odds offered on Sport Select are such that even the sharpest punter would have no hope of making a profit in the long term, some have. See, for instance, the 2007 Tax Court of Canada case R. v. Leblanc, in which two brothers netted $5.5 million on $50 million in bets over five years. The Tax Court ruled the profit was not taxable. =Ties= While ties are a common in soccer and used to be common in ice hockey as well, unlike what would be the case with most bookmakers the rules of Sport Select provide for betting on \\"ties\\" in nearly every sport including football, basketball and in some provinces baseball, even though ties are never allowed in basketball or baseball and are rare in football. Consequently, Sport Select mandates that any game decided by five points or less in basketball, three points or less in football or one run in baseball (where applicable) is declared a \\"tie\\". Furthermore, when the NHL introduced shootouts in for the 2005‚Äì06 season the lottery corporations (in contrast to most bookmakers) quickly ruled that shootout results would not count, specifically so they could keep offering \\"ties\\" in hockey. In Ontario, a hockey game that goes to a shootout counts as both a Tie and a Visitor or Home win, depending on the outcome. The rule is loathed by most Canadian gamblers because the size of the winning margin often means little to the teams on the field/court. Many bettors believe the rule's true purpose is to confuse gamblers and allow for larger vigs. =NBA= Wagering on NBA games was an issue when Toronto and Vancouver were being considered for NBA expansion franchises, due to strict league rules at the time which prohibited gambling. The Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies began play in the league in 1995 only after the provincial lottery corporations agreed to stop offering wagering on all NBA games. As part of the agreement, the Raptors paid $5 million in its first three years and $1 million annually afterwards to its charitable foundation to compensate the Ontario provincial lottery corporation for its loss of revenue. When the Grizzlies relocated to Memphis in 2001, British Columbia resumed allowing wagering on NBA games. In 2010, it was revealed that the Ontario Lottery Gaming Corporation and the Raptors were in negotiations to return wagering on NBA games to the province. In September 2016, it was announced that an agreement had been reached between the parties to allow betting on NBA games on Pro-Line in Ontario to resume beginning with the 2016-17 season. The move is projected to generate $5-10 million in profit for the province.

Consequently, Archelaus' title singled him out as the senior ruler, higher in rank than the tetrarchs and the chief of the Jewish nation; these three sovereignties were in a sense reunited under Herod Agrippa from AD 41 to 44. Previously, Hyrcanus II, one of the later Hasmonean rulers of Judea, had also held the title of ethnarch, as well as that of High Priest. In the New Testament the word is used only once by the Apostle Paul in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11:32). However the definition of the word in terms of the actual jurisdiction and public office of the ethnarch may not be accurately determined. Byzantine Empire The Byzantines used the term generically to refer to the rulers of barbarian tribes or realms outside the boundaries of their empire.\\"ETHNARCH\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 734. In a Christian context, where ethnikos meant \\"pagan,\\" some Church Fathers used the term ethnarches to designate pagan national gods. In the 10th century, the term acquired a more technical sense, when it was given to several high-ranking commanders. Although the specific nature of the title is not attested, it is generally accepted that in the 10th‚Äì11th centuries, it signified the commanders of the contingent of foreign mercenaries serving in the Byzantine army. Ottoman Empire Rather different was the case of minority community ethnarchs, especially within the Islamic Ottoman Empire that were recognized as legitimate entities (millet) and thus allowed to be heard by the government through an officially acknowledged representative, though without political persona. When the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II decided to give such dialogue a more formal nature, the logical choice for the major Orthodox Christian communities was the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The non-Chalcedonian Christians (Armenians, Syriacs, and Copts) were represented by the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople. For the far smaller, but also influential Jewish diaspora, a similar position was granted to the Hakham Bashi, i.e., chief rabbi. Modern Greece and Cyprus In modern Greek usage, the term has the connotation of \\"father of the nation\\", and is widely used as an epithet applied to some of the most influential political leaders of modern Hellenism: Eleftherios Venizelos, and Konstantinos Karamanlis.

Burmese Chinese constitute one group of overseas Chinese and is relatively small compared to other overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Although the Chinese officially make up three percent of the population, the actual figure is believed to be much higher. Among the under-counted Chinese populations are: those of mixed background; those that have registered themselves as ‚Äúethnic Bamar‚Äù to avoid discrimination; those that moved to Myanmar from China during earlier Qing Dynasty because of Manchu rule; new Chinese immigrants and traders that have resided in Upper Myanmar since the 1990s (up to 2 million by some estimates) but are not counted due to the lack of reliable census taking. As of 2012, the Burmese Chinese population is estimated to be at 1.6 million. Burmese Chinese are a well established middle class ethnic group and are well represented in all levels of Burmese society. Burmese Chinese also play a leading role in Myanmar's business sector and dominate the Burmese economy today. In addition, Burmese Chinese have a strong presence in Myanmar's political scene with several people such as Kyaing Kyaing, Khin Nyunt, and San Yu having been major political figures. Etymology Chinese in Bhamo, 1900. In the Burmese language, the Chinese are called Tayoke (, tarut), , and formerly spelt (tarup). The earliest evidence of this term dates to the Bagan era, in the 13th century, during which it referred to the territory and a variety of peoples to the north and northeast of Myanmar. Various scholars have proposed that it comes from the Chinese term for \\"Turk\\" (Á™ÅÂé•, T≈´ju√© / t√∫ ju√©); from the name of Dali (Â§ßÁêÜÂúã, D√†l«êgu√≥), the capital of the Kingdom of Nanzhao; a Chinese corruption of the term D√†yu√®zhƒ´ (Â§ßÊúàÊîØ or Â§ßÊúàÊ∞è), a Chinese term referring to Mongol-speaking Kushan Huns. The adoption of Tayoke to refer to the Han Chinese was not an established practice until the 19th century. In the Mon language, the Chinese are known as Krawk (, ); in Shan, they are called Khe (, ). In the Wa language, spoken in the borderlands between Yunnan Province and Shan State, the word for Chinese is Hox/Hawx, pronounced . Ancestral origins The area around Yangon and Lower Myanmar was traditionally populated with Han Chinese from Fujian and Guangdong, whereas the areas around Mandalay and Upper Myanmar such as Kokang were traditionally populated with Han Chinese from Yunnan. The Hokkiens and Cantonese comprised 45% of the ethnic Chinese population. The Yunnanese comprised 30-40% of the ethnic Chinese population. =Hokkien= Hokkien Chinese temple, Kheng Hock Keong Temple in Latha Township, Yangon * Hokkien Chinese (Burmese: eingyi shay , or let shay lit. long-sleeved jackets) from Fujian Province. Most of the Hokkien were traders. =Cantonese= Kwun Yam Temple in Latha Township, Yangon * Cantonese Chinese (Burmese: eingyi to , or let to lit. short-sleeved jackets) from central Guangdong Province. Most migrants from Guangdong Province were artisans. =Hakka= * Hakka Chinese (Burmese: zaka , lit. mid-length sleeve) from Fujian and Guangdong provinces Hakkas are further subdivided into those with ancestry from Fujian Province and Guangdong Province, called eingyi shay haka () and eingyi to haka () respectively. =Yunnanese= In Upper Myanmar and Shan Hills, the Kokang people, mainly speakers of Southwestern Mandarin Chinese, a form of Mandarin Chinese most akin to Yunnanese Chinese, predominate. The mountain-dwelling, farming Kokang are classified as a part of the Shan national race, although they have no linguistic or genetic affinity to the Tai-speaking Shan. =Panthay= The Panthay have long been considered distinct from the Han Chinese diaspora community. They are Chinese Muslims who are called Hui in China. =Sino-Burmese= Finally, there are the tayoke kabya () of mixed Chinese and indigenous Burmese parentage. The kabya (, meaning \\"mixed heritage\\") have a tendency to follow the customs of the Chinese more than of the Burmese. Indeed, tayoke kabya who follow Burmese customs are absorbed into and largely indistinguishable from mainstream Burmese society. A large portion of Burmese Chinese is thought to have some kabya blood, possibly because immigrants could acquire Burmese citizenship through intermarriage with the indigenous Burmese peoples. Socioeconomics =Education= The Burmese Chinese place a high importance on education and represent a disproportionately high share of those with advanced (medical, engineering or doctorate) degrees in Myanmar. The figure would be higher still had it not been for the longstanding ban on those without Burmese citizenship from pursuing advanced degrees when Ne Win instigated the 1982 Citizenship Law further restricted Burmese citizenship for Burmese Chinese (as it stratified citizenship into three categories: full, associate, and naturalized) and severely limited Burmese Chinese, especially those without full citizenship and those holding FRCs, from attending professional tertiary schools, including medical, engineering, agricultural and economics institutions. Many wealthy Sino-Burmese families send their children to the city's English language schools for primary and secondary education and Chinese and Singaporean Universities for education. Presently, many wealthy Burmese Chinese send their children overseas‚Äî in particular to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, for advanced studies. Taiwan is also a major destination, as the Taiwanese government offers aid and scholarship incentives to 'returning' overseas Chinese to study and settle there. Until vast nationalization by the Ne Win's government happened in 1963, most Burmese Chinese were enrolled in schools where Mandarin Chinese was the medium of instruction with Burmese as a second language. Notable Chinese schools at that time include: * Burma-Chinese High School (Á∑¨Áî∏ËèØÂÉë‰∏≠Â≠∏Ôºâ * Nanyang High School (Á∑¨Áî∏ÂçóÊ¥ã‰∏≠Â≠∏Ôºâ- now Basic Education High School No. 2 Bahan * Rangoon Chinese Elementary School (‰ª∞ÂÖâËèØÂÉëÂ∞èÂ≠∏Ôºâ * Kee Mei Elementary School (‰ª∞ÂÖâÈõÜÁæéÂ∞èÂ≠∏) =Employment= Historically, Burmese Chinese have made their livelihoods as merchants, traders, and shopkeepers as well as manual laborers such as indentured laborers (pejoratively called \\"coolies\\"); dockers, municipal workers, rickshaw men, and pony cart drivers. They were also heavily represented in certain professions such as civil servants, university lecturers, pharmacists, opticians, lawyers, engineers, and doctors. Trade and industry Mandalay continues to be Myanmar's major financial district and business networking hub for Burmese Chinese businessmen. The city is now teeming with thousands of prospering Chinese businesses. Like much of Southeast Asia, ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs dominate Burmese commerce at every level of society. Entrepreneurial savvy Chinese have literally taken over Myanmar's entire economy. Burmese Chinese wield tremendous economic clout and influence over their indigenous Burman majority counterparts and play a critical role in maintaining the country's economic vitality and prosperity. Entire Chinese enclaves have sprung up in major cities across the country. Burmese Chinese a disproportionate wealthy, market-dominant minority not only form a distinct ethnic community, they also form, by and large, an economically advantaged social class: the commercial middle and upper class in contrast to the poorer indigenous Burmese majority working and underclass around them. Mandalay is now the economic and financial nerve center of Upper Myanmar and is considered the epicenter of Burmese Chinese business culture. An influx of poor Han Chinese immigrants, mostly from the Yunnan province have continuously increased the dynamics of the economy throughout the entire nation and transformed Mandalay into the prosperous trading center that it is today. Established Sino-Burmese businessmen continue to remain at the helm of Myanmar's economy, where the Chinese minority have been transformed almost overnight into a garishly distinctive prosperous business community. Much of the foreign investment capital into the Burmese economy has been from Mainland Chinese investors and channeled though Burmese Chinese business networks for new startup businesses or foreign acquisitions. Many members of the Burmese Chinese business community act as agents for Mainland and overseas Chinese investors outside of Myanmar. In 1988, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) came to power, and gradually loosened the government's role in the economy, encouraging private sector growth and foreign investment. This liberalization of state's role in the economy, if slight and uneven, nonetheless gave Burmese Chinese-led businesses extra space to expand and reassert their economic clout. Today, virtually all of Myanmar's retail, wholesale and shipping firms are in Chinese hands. For example, Sein Gayha, a major Burmese retailer that began in Yangon's Chinatown in 1985, is owned by a Burmese Hakka family. Moreover, ethnic Chinese control the nations four of the five largest commercial banks, Myanmar Universal Bank, Yoma Bank, Myanmar Mayflower Bank, and the Asia Wealth Bank. Today, Myanmar's ethnic Chinese community are now at the forefront of opening up the country's economy, especially towards Mainland China as an international overseas Chinese economic outpost. The Chinese government has been very proactive in engaging with the overseas Chinese diaspora and using China's soft power to help the Burmese Chinese community stay close to their roots in order to foster business ties. Much of the foreign investment from Mainland China now entering Myanmar is being channeled through overseas Chinese bamboo networks. Many members of the Burmese Chinese business community often act as agents for expatriate and overseas Chinese investors outside of Myanmar. Ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs have been increasingly involved Mandalay's economy since the imposition of sanctions by the United States and the European Union in the 1990s. During Myanmar's open door immigration policy in the 1990s, Mandalay became the most remarkable destination for massive Chinese migration. With the onset of economic liberalization and the rise of free market capitalism in Myanmar, members of the Sino-Burmese community gravitated towards business and adhere to the Chinese paradigm of guanxi which is based on the importance of having contacts, relationships and connections as ingredients for business success. Following Myanmar's new market transformation, Chinese immigrants from Yunnan were able to obtain identity papers on the black market to become naturalized Burmese citizens overnight. Many foreign-born Chinese obtained Burmese citizenship cards on the black market. Identity cards were not only used for new Chinese migrants to stay indefinitely, but to also bypass laws on foreign ownership of businesses such as hotels, shops, and restaurants. A substantial increase in foreign investment has poured from Mainland China have flown into property and have been able to avoid the foreign ownership ban as many Mainland Chinese were able to obtain Myanmar identity cards via bribery or marriage to a Myanmar national through middlemen who themselves are Burmese citizens with Chinese ancestry. Retail stores were opened by Chinese entrepreneurs, whose business interests ranged from cement mixing to financial services as ambitious Chinese entrepreneurs have literally taken over the economies of Rangoon and Mandalay and turned them into the prosperous business and financial centers that they are today. As Mandalay became more economically prosperous, large influxes of ethnic Chinese immigrants have continued to settle there since the 19th century resulting a sinification of the entire city. The transformation of Mandalay into a booming modern metropolis filled with foreign businesses and gem trading centers occurred under the auspices of the entrepreneurial Chinese minority. Many ethnic Chinese owned and operated businesses such as trading companies, market stalls, food joints, medicine shops, hotels, and gem shops have also flourished. Today, virtually all of Mandalay's and Rangoon's shops, hotels, restaurants, financial services outlets and prime residential and commercial real estate are owned by ethnic Chinese. Prime real estate in key sites in Mandalay have been entirely acquired by wealthy Chinese businessmen and investors. As new Chinese migrants came into Myanmar flush with vast amounts of capital, they engaged heavily investing in businesses including wholesale marketing, gold and jewellery shops, hotels, restaurants, real estate, and jade mining. Mandalay's 100,000 strong Chinese population comprise ten percent of the city's entire population yet control all of Mandalay's retail gold shops, gemstone mining concessions, foreign business offices, and timber trading companies surrounded by Chinese owned large Victorian villas scattered on the outskirts left behind by the British colonialists. Gemstones and gold bars are among the many the goods sold on the Burmese commodities market and represent the trade of many Chinese expatriate entrepreneurs and investors. Foreign buyers of jade and gems have been flocking to the city of Mandalay, with clients from Hong Kong continuing to be the main customers. Mandalay been virtually sinicized economically and culturally, to the resentment of indigenous Burmese, who have been entirely displaced their into poverty stricken shantytowns in economic submission. Mandalay's other major industries include sports where the nation's popularity of soccer has sprung across the city. The soccer team, Yadanabon FC represents the city in the newly formed Myanmar National League, making it the nation's first professional soccer league. About 50 percent of the land plots in Downtown Mandalay are controlled by ethnic Chinese. Whenever a large real estate project, such as a hotel or shopping center that is about to be constructed, the project is typically under the hands of an ethnic Chinese real estate entrepreneur. In addition, more than 50 percent of the economic activity in Downtown Mandalay are dominated by Chinese-owned shops, hotels, restaurants, and showrooms. About 80 percent of the hotels and guesthouses, more than 70 percent of the restaurants, more than 45 percent of gold and jewelry shops, about 30 percent of jade and gemstone trading, and nearly 100 percent of the sale centers for Mainland Chinese made commodities in Mandalay are owned and operated by Chinese. Ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs have acquired all of the central Mandalay's economic arteries and quickly controlled and dominated much of the city's business activity. In Central Mandalay, about 80 percent or four out of five gold and jewelry shops are owned by ethnic Chinese. In addition, all of Mandalay's shopping malls and hotels were entirely built and owned by ethnic Chinese construction and real estate development companies. Expatriate Chinese entrepreneurs have economically revitalized and continue to dominate Mandalay's central business district while Mainland China's influence has become so prevalent, that the local inhabitants have referred to Mandalay as a \\"Chinese city\\" dominated by an inflow of international expatriate Chinese money, much of it invested in hotels, restaurants, and bars. The strong economic clout and influence exerted by the Chinese in Mandalay, Yangon, and other parts of northern Myanmar have entirely displaced indigenous Burmans into poverty stricken ghetto shantytowns on the outskirts of major Burmese cities. Goods manufactured historically by indigenous Burmans have been entirely displaced by inexpensive Chinese consumer goods such as textiles, machinery, and electronics in terms of quality and price. Tapestry weaving, gold leaf carving, furniture crafting, and precious stone polishing was historically a source of employment and income for indigenous Burman artisans have entirely been displaced and taken over by the Burmese Chinese. Many products historically made by indigenous Burmans have been entirely displaced by cheaper Chinese imports and higher quality Burmese Chinese made products. Burmese Chinese entrepreneurs dominate every major Burmese business sector including silk weaving, tapestry, jade cutting and polishing, stone and wood carving, making marble and bronze Buddha images, food products, temple ornaments and paraphernalia, the working of gold leaves and of silver, garments, pharmaceuticals, match manufacturing, brewing, and distilling. Burmese Chinese entrepreneurs have also have established heavy industry joint ventures with many large Chinese conglomerates. These industries include shipbuilding, copper, nickel, oil and natural gas, cement, base metals, coal, fertilizers, jet fuel, industrial minerals, kerosene, steel, tin, tungsten, agricultural processing, forestry, airlines, wood and wood products, teak logging, timber, rice, and building materials, machinery, transport equipment, and plastics. Chinese consumer electronics, beer, and fashion are also large industries. In Yangon, the Hokkien operate small and medium-sized family businesses in teak logging, rice, bean and legume trading, and cooking oil production while the Cantonese focused on small-scale manufacturing of handicrafts and similar artisan retail products. Between 1895 and 1930, Sino- Burmese businesses were initially concentrated within three sectors: Brokerage, manufacturing, and contracting. Under British rule, Chinese share of the businesses was reduced significantly from 28.5 to 10 percent in manufacturing, 26.6 to 1.8 percent in brokerage and 31 to 4.3 percent in contracting while Burmese Indians improved their economic positions significantly and controlled a larger proportion of the businesses within the three sectors. Other major sectors between 1895 and 1930 that declined included banking and money-lending, dropping from 33.3 percent to zero. Trading changed from 13.3 to 12.6 percent. Similar drops in market share occurred in the import-export trade, extraction, distribution-supply, and business partnerships. However, Chinese share in milling increased from 0 to 4.5 percent, agents from 13.3 to 15.6 percent, shopkeeping from 6.7 to 18.3 percent, and merchanting from 12.3 to 13.1 percent. Of the 47 rice mills in Myanmar, 13 percent was controlled by ethnic Chinese and was utilized for rice exportation and processing. During the last few decades of the 19th century, Chinese turned to rural money-lending. Sino-Burmese businessmen also ran illicit opium and gambling dens, tea shops, liquor stores and also acted as agents for the sale of petroleum products. As Sino-Burmese entrepreneurs became more financially prosperous, they often pooled large amounts of seed capital and started joint ventures with overseas Chinese business moguls and investors from all over the world. However, most stayed in Myanmar or concentrated their efforts on surrounding Southeast Asian markets such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand as well as the Greater Chinese market such as Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Many Burmese Chinese entrepreneurs have friends and relatives in Mainland China has produced favourable conditions for them to support wealth accumulation by introducing the wholesale market of Chinese made products in Myanmar abroad. Legal two-way trade between Mainland China and Myanmar reached 1.5 billion dollars USD per year by 1988 and additional Chinese trade, investment, economic, and military aid was sought to invigorate the Burmese economy. In order to secure and protect their economic interests, the Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce serves as a guild, association, business nerve center and lobby group for local Burmese Chinese businessmen. Most notably, the Malaysian business magnate Robert Kuok converted Mandalay and Rangoon into the largest economic hubs for Mainland Chinese and Southeast Asian Chinese business networking and deal making in Myanmar. For smaller businesses and newer start-ups, many self- employed Sino-Burmese retail hawkers make a great living selling cheap bicycle tires imported from China. Ethnic Chinese dominate Myanmar's jade industry and have been the chief driving force behind Burmese gem mining and jade exports. Private gem mining is a large industry in Myanmar with many of the concessionaires being controlled by Sino-Burmese entrepreneurs. At present, Myanmar's booming gem industry is completely under Chinese hands and the thriving Burmese Chinese businessmen at every level, from the financiers, concession operators all the way to the merchants that own scores of newly opened gem markets. One Chinese-owned jewelry company reportedly controls 100 gem mines and produces over 2,000 kilograms of raw rubies annually. Since the privatization of the gem industry during the 1990s, Sino-Burmese jewelers and entrepreneurs have transformed Myanmar's gem industry into new retail jewelry shops selling coveted pieces of expensive jewelry. One notable incident occurred in June 2011 where a gem market was forced to be shut down after a fight embroiled a group of Chinese and Burmese merchants over a business deal that went sour. Allegedly, the Burmese and Chinese merchants were embroiled in a fight over a deal that was worth US$5,300. Burmese Chinese entrepreneurs are not just dominant in the big business sector but also in the small and medium- sized business sector as well. Burmese Chinese have dominated several types of businesses such as selling bicycle tires, auto parts, electrical equipment, textiles, precious metals, machinery, ironmongery, hardware, printing and bookbinding, books and stationery, paper and printing ink, tailoring and dry- cleaning, jewelry, English tutoring, and money exchanges. Beauty parlors, construction sites, mobile phone sale centers, traditional Chinese medicine clinics, restaurants, pubs, dry cleaners, laundromats, cafes, casinos and gambling dens, breweries, nightclubs, hotels and karaoke bars are also common establishments. Ethnic Chinese minorities dominate both the legitimate trade as well as the highly lucrative illegitimate trade in opium and other unsavory drug enterprises. Sino-Burmese businessmen such as Lo Hsing Han and Kyaw Win continue to control Myanmar's major banks, airlines, teak logging companies, and gemstone mining concessions. Lo's son, Steven Law is also a prominent businessman well known for being at the helm of Myanmar's largest conglomerate company Asia World, whose investments include a container shipping operator, port buildings, and toll road authorities. Law also has business holdings in sports, where he is the majority owner of Magway FC, a Burmese soccer team. Law also has holding's in Myanmar's gem industry where it is valued at an estimated $600 million. His holdings include numerous valuable ruby concessions as well as \\"a mining stake in northern jade rush' town of Phakent\\". His conglomerate is also the most popular business partner for foreign investors looking to invest in Myanmar's private gem industry. An influx of foreign capital investment from Mainland China, Germany, and France have led to new construction projects across Myanmar. Mainland China has poured investment into the country supplying the Burmese economy with plenty of cheap Chinese goods and services in the market in addition to provide money for new startup infrastructure projects. Many of these infrastructure projects are in the hands of Chinese construction contractors and civil engineers with large scale construction undertakings including irrigation dams, highways, bridges, ground satellite stations, and an international airport for Mandalay. Sino-Burmese entrepreneurs have also established numerous joint ventures with Mainland Chinese State-owned enterprises and companies for the construction of oil pipelines that could bring thousands of jobs into the country. Private Chinese firms, many of which are small to medium-sized businesses rely on established business networks between China and Burmese Chinese entrepreneurs to conduct trade between the two countries. Mainland China is now Myanmar's most important source of foreign goods and services well as one of the most important sources of foreign direct investment, accounting for 61 per cent of all FDI into the country from 2013 to 2014. Chinese SOEs account for 57 percent of all foreign firms operating in Myanmar and are primarily involved in the oil and gas, power, and mineral sectors while private firms that engage in licit/illicit trade account for a majority of foreign investment in Myanmar's domestic economy. Chinese structural power over Myanmar's structure of finance also provides China with a dominant position within the country's natural resource sector, primarily Myanmar's latent oil, gas, and uranium sectors. Its position galvanizes China's position as Myanmar's primary investor and consumer of its extractive industries, which accounts for a majority of China's investment holdings. Many Chinese capitalists have realized that it has been more advantageous for them to invest in Myanmar's mining, lumber, and energy sectors. A number of them have targeted Myanmar's high value natural resource industries such as raw jade stones, teak and timber, rice, and marine fishery industries. As ethnic Chinese economic might grew, much of the indigenous Burmese majority have gradually been driven out into poorer land on the hills, on the outskirts of major Burmese cities or into the mountains. Disenchantment grew among the displaced indigenous Burmese hill tribes who felt they were unable compete with ethnic Chinese businesses. During the Burmese property boom in the 1990s, Chinese real estate investors began building and speculating as property values doubled and tripled in values resulted indigenous Burmese being pushed further away from their native homes and displaced into the outskirts of major Burmese cities towards impoverished shantytowns. Underlying resentment and bitterness from the impoverished Burmese majority has been accumulating as there has been no existence of indigenous Burmese having any substantial business equity in Myanmar. The increased economic clout held in the hands of the Chinese in Myanmar has triggered distrust, resentment and anti-Chinese hostility among the indigenous Burmese majority. Decades of free market liberalization brought virtually no economic benefit to the indigenous Burmese majority but rather the opposite resulting a subjugated indigenous Burmese majority underclass, many of whom still engage in menial labor, rural peasantry or illegal teak smuggling in a stark socioeconomic contrast to their modern, wealthier, and cosmopolitan middle class Chinese counterparts. Thousands of displaced Burmese hill tribes and aborigines live in satellite shantytowns on the outskirts of Mandalay in economic destitution. The wealth disparity and abject poverty among the indigenous Burmese aborigines has resulted hostility blaming their socioeconomic ills on foreign domination, exploitation, and looting of their country by a relative handful of outsiders, namely Chinese. Culture Celebrating tour in the Chinese New Year; mainly from tan (colour) Chinese teenagers, Yangon The Kuan Yin Temple (Kwan Yin Si) is a local place of worship for Burmese Chinese in Bago and serves as a Mandarin school for the local community. =Language= Most Burmese Chinese speak Burmese in their daily life. Those with higher education also speak Mandarin and/or English. The use of Chinese dialects still prevails. Hokkien (a dialect of Min Nan) and Taishanese (a Yue dialect akin to Cantonese) are mostly used in Yangon as well as in Lower Myanmar, while Yunnanese Mandarin is well preserved in Upper Myanmar. Although General Ne Win's rule (1962‚Äì1988) enacted the ban on Chinese-language schools that caused a decline of Mandarin speakers, the number of Chinese schools is growing again. (Note: Standard Mandarin refers to the national language of Mainland China and Taiwan, distinct from the Southwestern Mandarin dialect of the Upper Myanmar, Kokang and Panthay). At the end of 2012, Mizzima News reported that an increasing number of young Burmese Chinese are expressing interest in Chinese language, taking language courses even when their parents don't understand Chinese. However, this trend is not necessarily indicative of an interest in joining Chinese community or cultural organizations, as many of their parents did. Groups like the Myanmar Overseas Young Chinese League report a lack of interest from Burmese Chinese youth. The Panthay Mosque () in Mandalay serves the local Panthay community. =Religion= Most Burmese Chinese practice Theravada Buddhism, incorporating some Mahayana Buddhist and Taoist beliefs, such as the worship of Kuan Yin. There are several notable Chinese temples in Yangon, including Fushan Temple (a Buddhist temple), Kheng Hock Keong Temple (a Taoist temple dedicated to Mazu) and Guanyin Gumiao Temple (a Buddhist temple dedicated to Guanyin). The Panthay or Chinese Muslims (ÂõûÊïôËèØ‰∫∫; , lit. \\"little flowers\\") practice Islam. =Names= The Burmese Chinese have Burmese names and many also have Chinese names. Given names in various Chinese dialects are often transliterated into the Burmese language, using phonetic transcriptions or translated. For example, a Burmese Chinese person named 'Khin Aung' may have the Chinese name of ÊÖ∂Ë±ê (Hokkien POJ: Kh√®ng-hong), with 'ÊÖ∂' (Hokkien POJ: kh√®ng) corresponding to 'Khin', and 'Ë±ê' (Hokkien POJ: hong) corresponding to 'Aung'. However, variations of transcription do exist (between dialects), and some Burmese Chinese do not choose to adopt similar-sounding Burmese and Chinese names. Because the Burmese lack surnames, many Burmese Chinese tend to pass on portions of their given names to future generations, for the purpose of denoting lineage. According to publications of Long Shan Tang, a clan association based in Yangon, the ten most common Chinese surnames in Yangon are: # Lee/Li (Êùé) # Peng/Pang (ÂΩ≠) # Shi/See/Si (ÊôÇ) # Dong/Tung (Ëë£) # Min/Man (Èñî) # Niu/Ngau (Áâõ) # Pian/Pin (ÈÇä) # Hsin (Ëæõ) # Kwan (Èóú) # Khaw (Ë®±) =Cuisine= tikay and paste-filled buns. Burmese Chinese cuisine is based on Chinese cuisine, particularly from Fujian, Guangdong and Yunnan provinces, with local influences. Spices such as turmeric and chili are commonly used. Also, the use of soy sauce, bean curd, bean sprouts, Chinese pickled mustards, and dried mushrooms can be attributed to Chinese influence. The following is a partial list of Chinese contributions to Burmese cuisine. These are an established part of today's Burmese cuisine, and are hardly differentiated as a foreign cuisine. * Pauksi: steamed buns * B√®kin: roasted duck * Igyakway: fried Chinese doughnut * Htamin kyaw: fried rice * La mont: mooncake * Mi shay: thin rice noodle soup * Mi swan: thin wheat noodles * San byoke: rice porridge * Panthay khauk sw√®: Panthay-style fried noodles * Sigyet khauksw√®: literally \\"noodles laced in cooked oil,\\" usually with chicken * kyay o: literally \\"beehoon soup with chicken or pork,\\" History A joss house in Bhamo (Bamaw). =Pre-colonial era= The earliest records of Chinese migration into present-day Myanmar were in the Song and Ming dynasties. In the 18th century, Ming Dynasty princes settled in Kokang (the northern part of present-day Myanmar). Chinese traders, however, traveled as far as the capital city as well as northern towns on the Irrawaddy such as Bhamo. Some of them stayed and started a Chinese community at Amarapura, and when King Mindon moved his capital to Mandalay in 1859, the Chinese were the only community that decided to stay behind. Many of their descendants intermarried into the host society and remain important and respected citizens of Amarapura. =Colonial period= A portrait of a Sino-Burmese merchant and his wife in Rangoon Another wave of immigration occurred in the 19th century under the British colonial administration. Britain encouraged immigration of Indians and Chinese to British Burma, and such incentives for work opportunities and enterprise and for accumulating wealth attracted many Chinese. They primarily came to Burma via British Malaya. The Chinese quickly became dominant in the highly lucrative rice and gem industries. Many became merchants and traders owning both wholesale and retail businesses. Unlike in British Malaya, where most Chinese were coolie laborers, the Chinese in Burma were largely from the artisan and merchant classes. Their success was reflected in the popular Burmese adage, \\"Earn like the Chinese, save like the Indian, and don't waste money like the Bamar.\\" () A baker's shop in Mandalay's Chinatown in the late 1800s They integrated well into Burmese society not least because they, like the Bamar, were of Sino-Tibetan stock and were Buddhists, implicit in the nickname pauk hpaw (, lit. \\"sibling\\"). During British rule, marriage between the Chinese and Burmese, particularly Chinese men and Burmese women, was the most common form of intermarriage in Burma, as evidenced by a High Court ruling on the legal status of Sino-Burmese marriages under Burmese Buddhist law. The Chinese are arguably the only other group of people, apart from the Hindu Indians, the ethnic Bamar historically have a high regard for, not just for their ancient and uninterrupted civilization but for their skills and intellect as well. From 1935 until the end of British rule, the Chinese were represented in the colonial legislature, the House of Representatives. After World War II, displaced Burmese Chinese (whose pre-war homes were in Burma), were the most numerous group of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia to request repatriation to return to Burma, according to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. =Post-independence era= The Yunnanese Buddhist Temple and Association in Mandalay is a major Chinese temples in the city. During the 1950s, Burma was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China as a nation. However, its own Chinese population was treated as aliens. The Burmese Chinese were issued foreign registration cards (FRC) in a tiered citizenship system adopted by the post-independence government. When the Chinese Communists expelled the Kuomintang, many fled to Myanmar and Thailand over the borders of Yunnan Province. The Burmese government fought and removed the armed KMT and forced them to Taiwan; those who managed to stay prospered. In the 1950s, discriminatory policies against overseas Chinese encompassed citizenship, government employment, approval for business regulations and licensing, loan extensions and permission to make remittances. In 1952, Kheng Hock Keong Temple publications estimated that ethnic Chinese, who lived in enclaves in the area along Sinohdan, Latha, and Maung Khaing Streets (with Cantonese typically living above Maha Bandula Road and Hokkiens living below), constituted 9.5% of Rangoon's population. During this period, there was a sharp rise in the number of private Chinese language schools, primarily teaching Mandarin, in Burma, from 65 in 1935 to 259 in 1953 and 259 at its peak in 1962, with many such schools affiliated to the Chinese nationalist (, lit. \\"White Chinese\\") or communist (, lit. \\"Red Chinese\\") movements. However, fewer than 10% of Burmese Chinese of school age attended Chinese language schools.Murray (1964), p. 80. Similarly, about 80 clan associations operated in the 1950s. =Socialist rule= In 1962, Ne Win led the Socialist coup d'√©tat, establishing the Revolutionary Council under the Burmese Way to Socialism. In February 1963, the Enterprise Nationalization Law was passed, effectively nationalizing all major industries and prohibiting the formation of new factories. This law adversely affected many industrialists and entrepreneurs, especially those without the full citizenship.Holmes (1967), p. 190. The government's economic nationalization program further prohibited foreigners, including the non-citizen Chinese, from owning land, sending remittances, getting business licenses and practicing medicine.Holmes (1967), p. 191. Such policies led to the beginnings of a major exodus of Burmese Chinese to other countries‚Äîsome 100,000 Chinese left Burma. Although a kabya himself, Ne Win banned Chinese-language education and created other measures to compel the Chinese to leave. Ne Win's government stoked up racial animosity and ethnic conflicts against the Chinese, who were terrorized by Burmese citizens, the most violent riots taking place at the time of the Cultural Revolution in China in 1967. All schools were nationalized, including Chinese language schools. Beginning in 1967 and continuing throughout the 1970s, anti-Chinese riots continued to flare up and many believed they were covertly supported by the government. Similarly, Chinese shops were looted and set on fire. Public attention was successfully diverted by Ne Win from the uncontrollable inflation, scarcity of consumer items and rising prices of rice. The 1982 Citizenship Law further restricted Burmese citizenship for Burmese Chinese (as it stratified citizenship into three categories: full, associate, and naturalized) and severely limited Burmese Chinese, especially those without full citizenship and those holding FRCs, from attending professional tertiary schools, including medical, engineering, agricultural and economics institutions. During this period, the country's failing economy and widespread discrimination accelerated an emigration of Burmese Chinese out of Burma. =Modern era= The Yangon Chinatown branch of the retailer Sein Gayha on Maha Bandula Rd near 20th Street also houses Ying Fo Fui Kun (ÊáâÂíåÊúÉÈ§®), a Hakka Chinese clan association. Chinese New Year festivities in Yangon's Chinatown in 2011. In 1988, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) came to power, and gradually loosened the government's role in the economy, encouraging private sector growth and foreign investment. This liberalization of state's role in the economy, if slight and uneven, nonetheless gave the ethnic Chinese-led businesses extra space to expand and reassert their economic power. Today, the majority of retail, wholesale and import trade businesses are run by the Burmese Chinese today. For example, Sein Gayha (), a major retailer that began in Yangon's Chinatown in 1985, is owned by a Hakka Chinese family. Moreover, four of the five largest commercial banks in Myanmar, Myanmar Universal Bank, Yoma Bank, Myanmar Mayflower Bank, and the Asia Wealth Bank, were all founded by Sino-Burmese. Today, the majority of Burmese Chinese live in the major cities of Yangon, Mandalay, Taunggyi, Bago, and their surrounding areas. Although there are Chinatowns (; tayoke tan) in the major cities, the Chinese are widely dispersed throughout the country. The northern region of Myanmar has seen a recent influx of mainland Chinese migrant workers, black market traders and gamblers. In Kachin State, which borders China in three directions, Standard Mandarin is the lingua franca. Upper Myanmar has seen a demographic shift resulting from the recent immigration of many Mainland Chinese to Mandalay Region, Shan, and Kachin States. Ethnic Chinese now constitute an estimated 30 to 40% of Mandalay's population. Huge swaths of land in city centre left vacant by the fires were later purchased, mostly by the ethnic Chinese, many of whom were recent immigrants from Yunnan. The Chinese influx accelerated after the current military government came to power in 1988. With the Burmese government turning a blind eye, many Chinese immigrants from Yunnan (and also from Sichuan) poured into Upper Myanmar in the 1990s, settling in Mandalay. In the 1990s alone, about 250,000 to 300,000 Yunnanese were estimated to have migrated to Mandalay. Their arrival has been vital in the doubling of Mandalay's population from about 500,000 in 1980 to one million in 2008. Chinese festivals are now firmly embedded in the city's cultural calendar. The strong influx of Mainland Chinese immigrants into Mandalay coupled with the presence of strong Chinese economic clout resulted the subsequent displacement of indigenous Burmese to the outskirts of the city creating racial tensions between the two communities. There are also substantial Burmese Chinese communities outside of Myanmar, particularly in Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore, United States (such as New York City's Henry Street) and Australia. Zhonghe District, near Taipei, Taiwan is home to 40,000 Burmese Chinese (2008), one of the largest communities outside of Myanmar.

Each humanitarian crisis is caused by different factors and as a result, each different humanitarian crisis requires a unique response targeted towards the specific sectors affected. This can result in either short-term or long-term damage. Humanitarian crises can either be natural disasters, man-made disasters or complex emergencies. In such cases, complex emergencies occur as a result of several factors or events that prevent a large group of people from accessing their fundamental needs, such as food, clean water or safe shelter.So experts exclude that to address such crises it is possible to deny essential goods or pledging any action not to alleviate the suffering: Humanitarian Experts Debate Trump's Use Of The Term 'Humanitarian Crisis', NPR24, January 9, 2019. Examples of humanitarian crises include armed conflicts, epidemics, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies.\\"Humanitarian workshop flyer\\", Retrieved on 7 May 2013. If such a crisis causes large movements of people it could also become a refugee crisis. For these reasons, humanitarian crises are often interconnected and complex and several national and international agencies play roles in the repercussions of the incidences. Categories There is no simple categorization of humanitarian crises. Different communities and agencies tend to have definitions related to the concrete situations they face. A local fire service will tend to focus on issues such as flooding and weather induced crises. Medical and health related organizations are naturally focused on sudden crises to the health of a community. An ongoing or lingering pandemic may amount to a humanitarian crisis, especially where there are increasing levels of virulence, or rates of infection as in the case of AIDS, bird flu or tuberculosis. Major health-related problems such as cancer, global warming typically require an accentuated or punctuated mass-event to justify a label of \\"crisis\\" or \\"disaster\\". The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) lists categories which include different types of natural disasters, technological disasters (i.e. hazardous material spills, Chernobyl-type of nuclear accidents, chemical explosions) and long-term man- made disasters related to \\"civil strife, civil war and international war\\". Internationally, the humanitarian response sector has tended to distinguish between natural disasters and complex emergencies which are related to armed conflict and wars.Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs handbook for complex emergencies Impacts =Women's social status in humanitarian crises= Socially, women and children (mostly girls) receive a significantly decreased amount of attention in response to humanitarian crises. Women and children make up 3 quarters of refugees or displaced persons at risk post- crisis. A quarter of this population is of reproduction age and a fifth of this population is likely to be pregnant. In times of emergency and such crises, deaths associated with pregnancy, reproductive health, sexual violence and sexual exploitation increase drastically especially amongst females. During such emergencies, women lose access to family planning services, prenatal care, postpartum care and other health services. The heightened risk of female health and safety makes them vulnerable to disease, violence and death. Non-profit organizations such as the Women's Refugee Commission deal with aiding particularly women suffering from various types of humanitarian crises. According to the Women's Refugee Commission, during the first hours of a humanitarian crisis, women and young children are at most risk. During such an event, agencies and organizations approach matters variably. However, the top critical requirements within hours and months of the crises include: keeping the refugees and internally displaced persons away from danger, allowing access to fundamental needs such as food and healthcare, identification information, preventing sexual violence and others. =Socio- economic realities of humanitarian crises= Economic issues can lead to humanitarian crises or humanitarian crises can lead to economic downfalls. If it occurs after a humanitarian crisis affects a nation, it is imperative to return the livelihoods in the economic settings of the nation. One of the critical needs on the Women's Refugee Commission's list is providing education and economic opportunities in order to maintain the economic qualities of the region. It is done by using the skills of the displaced persons or refugees involved to provide them with opportunities to gain income. If it occurs as a cause of humanitarian crisis, the society would have been in a state of civil insecurity and economic shortfalls, which could cause the government to collapse. This can also result from food insecurity, famines, corruptions and various other issues. Direct effects of this situation include human rights violations, violence and mass murders. =Environmental and ecological impacts= In the cases of humanitarian crises, especially natural disasters such as tornadoes, tsunamis and earthquakes, these incidences leave environmental and ecological impacts on the regions affected. The aftermaths of natural disasters can lead to a significant decrease in natural resources while making the region prone to future issues. For example, if a forest fire occurs in a large region, the area may be susceptible to air pollution, dust clouds, release of carcinogenic gases and others. Forest ecological wildlife, for example, is severely impacted by such events. In the cases of water natural disasters such as floods and tsunamis, extensive damage due to the water is prevalent.http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-2-the- pre-travel-consultation/natural-disasters-and-environmental-hazards.htm Fish, corals and other ocean life is impacted, which further impacts the livelihoods of fishermen. Sustainable solutions There is no singular solution to any one humanitarian crisis. Often, the primary cause of a humanitarian crisis is intertwined with several other factors. Further, one repercussion can lead to another which may lead to another. For instance, in the case of a flood, fish and ocean life is impacted, an environmental and ecological impact. This can further impact humans the source of income for fishermen, an economical impact. This causes the residents of this particular area to be stripped from their source of food and their culture of consuming sea fish. This can lead to women and children being forced to work in dangerous conditions to gain income and food, a social impact. Evidently, one crisis can have many impacts that are interconnected with one another and there is no single solution. The Feinstein International Center at Tufts University works to understand and find solutions to the intersection of various factors that contribute to humanitarian crisis. Preparing for humanitarian crises Disaster preparedness is critical to building both national and international capacity to prevent, respond to, and recover from humanitarian emergencies. Disaster preparedness activities can be categorized into material preparedness (building to code, avoiding building in hazardous areas, strengthening homes, preparing emergency kits, etc.) and into behavioral preparedness (training, early warning, disaster insurance, etc.). The international community possesses five key to key entities for guidance programming, research, and funding for disaster preparedness capacity-building: * United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction: The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction implements the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR). The UNISDR, led by the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction, serves, ‚Äú‚Ä¶as the focal point in the United Nations system for the coordination of disaster reduction and to ensure synergies among disaster reduction activities\\". A component of UNISDR work is implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015‚Äì2030. * International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC): The IFRC operates around the globe and across all phases of the humanitarian programme cycle, helping affected nations by working with member National Societies and the international community to prepare for, respond to, and recover from ‚Äú‚Ä¶natural and man-made disasters in non-conflict situations.\\" * Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA): OCHA is a United Nations office, ‚Äú‚Ä¶responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies.\\" OCHA's leader operates as both the Under-Secretary- General for Humanitarian Affairs and as the Emergency Relief Coordinator, advocating for increased awareness of, preparedness for, and response to humanitarian emergencies worldwide. As the Emergency Relief Coordinator, the OCHA lead also chairs the Inter-Agency Standing Committee. * Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC): The IASC provides a forum for both UN-affiliated and non-UN-affiliated organizations to coordinate action regarding humanitarian policies, advocacy, and response evaluation and improvement. In 2005, the IASC released its Transformative Agenda with 10 protocols to, ‚Äú‚Ä¶improve the effectiveness of humanitarian response through greater predictability, accountability, responsibility and partnership\\". Protocol 8: ‚ÄúCommon Framework for Preparedness‚Äù and Protocol 9: ‚ÄùEmergency Response Preparedness‚Äù provide guidance countries and humanitarians can implement for risk assessment and preparedness planning. Additionally, IASC also oversees global humanitarian clusters as a part of the Cluster Approach. * Global Clusters: To aid coordination during the humanitarian programme cycle, the UN established the Cluster Approach. Clusters are groups of humanitarian organizations with explicit responsibilities for coordinating action within each humanitarian sector. Preparedness is fundamental to the Cluster Approach, with leaders within each global cluster working to build international capacity by developing standards, setting policy, and sharing leading practices for their sector before a humanitarian emergency occurs. In addition to these five disaster preparedness entities, there is a multiplicity of government donor agencies that fund disaster preparedness activities, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Kingdom‚Äôs Department for International Development (DFID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), and others. Additionally, there many philanthropies that support disaster preparedness, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

This resulted in the Baho Ainanshe and Rer Sugulleh sub-clans revolting in opposition to the tax and clashing with other sections of the Habr Yunis and the British colonial government. This resulted in a shoot out in which Captain Allan Gibb, a Dervish war veteran, was shot and killed. The British as retaliation burnt down Burao and requested from Sir Winston Churchill, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, to send troops from Aden and Airplane bombers in order to bomb the wells and livestock of the Rer Ainanshe clans and quell any further rebellion.Colonial Office, April 11, 1922 After the killing of Gibb all Europeans entered the Burao fort, which at the time was occupied by the Native Somali B Company of the Somaliland Camel Corps. The Hargeisa Camel Corps was wired and informed of the incident and ordered to send troops to Burao. The Indian Sepoys having been sent back to the sub-continent forced the Government to rely on the Somali B company, but when ordered to open fire on the hostile Habr Yunis tribesmen, they declined. The British had to resort to sending Indian troops from Aden as they could not trust the native Somalis. Instead The B company was tasked with collecting the fine imposed on the Rer Ainanshe. B company was eventually disbanded and replaced with the more obedient Yao Askaris from the 1st King's African Rifles.

HC Deb 14 March 1922 > vol 151 cc1953-4 Burao was the site of the unilateral declaration of an independent Somaliland on May 18, 1991. Demographics Burao is the second-largest city in Somaliland with a population of 288,211 according to the (2005) UN estimate The main residents of Burao are the Habr Yonis, Issa Musse and Habr Je'lo which are all subdivisions of the larger Isaaq Somali clan. Municipality and services A fabric and carpet boutique in Burao's old section The city enjoys full-time electricity and a reliable water supply from groundwater. In addition, Burao's central location has contributed to its economic revival. Goods travelling to the south, central and eastern parts of Somaliland all depart from the city's outskirts. Rural merchants also sell their produce on a daily basis, which attracts business. In 2007, Burao's city authority (in conjunction with development organizations and local traders) opened the Burco Meat and Produce complex. One year in the making, the market has two main halls and can accommodate more than 2000 merchants. The Burao Municipality is led by Mayor Mohamud Ahmed Hassan. Geography Weather in Burao, much like other inland towns in Somaliland, is warm and dry year-round. The average daytime temperatures during the summer months of June and August can rise to 31 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F), with a low of 20 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F) at night. The weather is cooler the rest of the year, averaging 27 ¬∞C (80 ¬∞F) during the day and 13 ¬∞C (57 ¬∞F) at nighttime. The city's limited rainfall of 222 mm usually comes with two peaks during April‚ÄìMay and October‚ÄìNovember. The Togdheer River runs through the town. It is often dry but subject to flooding. The river divides the city in half, and can be crossed via a newly built bridge in the city center. Burao's landscape is semi-desert and fairly flat. Climate Wildlife Due to the fertility and greenery of the region, wild animals come to the area either to breed or to graze on the grassland savannah. Prominent animals found locally include the kudu, wild boars, zebras, the Somali Wild Ass, warthogs, antelopes, the Somali sheep, wild goats, camels, and many different types of birds. Due south of Burao is a grassland savannah, which attracts many types of fauna to the region, including lions and leopards. Transportation A residential area in Burao Burao has a working bus system. Air transportation needs are served by the Burao Airport, which offers flights via Daallo Airlines to Hargeisa and other cities in the Horn of Africa, as well as international locations such as Addis Ababa and San'a. As of 2012, the airport's facilities are undergoing major renovations, supervised by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

One views X as \\"suspended\\" between these end points. The space SX is sometimes called the unreduced, unbased, or free suspension of X, to distinguish it from the reduced suspension Œ£X of a pointed space described below. The reduced suspension can be used to construct a homomorphism of homotopy groups, to which the Freudenthal suspension theorem applies. In homotopy theory, the phenomena which are preserved under suspension, in a suitable sense, make up stable homotopy theory. Suspension of a circle. The original space is in blue, and the collapsed end points are in green.  Definition and properties of suspension  Given a topological space X, the suspension of X is defined as :SX = (X \\\\times I)/\\\\sim the quotient space of the product of X with the unit interval I = [0, 1] modulo the equivalence relation \\\\sim generated by :(x_1,0)\\\\sim(x_2,0)\\\\mbox{ and }(x_1,1)\\\\sim(x_2,1) \\\\mbox{ for all } x_1,x_2 \\\\in X. One can view the suspension as two cones on X glued together at their base; it is also homeomorphic to the join X\\\\star S^0, where S^0 is a discrete space with two points. In rough terms S increases the dimension of a space by one: it takes an n-sphere to an (n + 1)-sphere for n ‚â• 0\\\\. Given a continuous map f:X\\\\rightarrow Y, there is a continuous map Sf:SX\\\\rightarrow SY defined by Sf([x,t]):=[f(x),t], where square brackets denote equivalence classes. This makes S into a functor from the category of topological spaces to itself. Reduced suspension If X is a pointed space with basepoint x0, there is a variation of the suspension which is sometimes more useful. The reduced suspension or based suspension Œ£X of X is the quotient space: :\\\\Sigma X = (X\\\\times I)/(X\\\\times\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}\\\\cup X\\\\times\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\}\\\\times I). This is the equivalent to taking SX and collapsing the line (x0 √ó I) joining the two ends to a single point. The basepoint of the pointed space Œ£X is taken to be the equivalence class of (x0, 0). One can show that the reduced suspension of X is homeomorphic to the smash product of X with the unit circle S1. :\\\\Sigma X \\\\cong S^1 \\\\wedge X For well-behaved spaces, such as CW complexes, the reduced suspension of X is homotopy equivalent to the unbased suspension. = Adjunction of reduced suspension and loop space functors = Œ£ gives rise to a functor from the category of pointed spaces to itself. An important property of this functor is that it is left adjoint to the functor \\\\Omega taking a pointed space X to its loop space \\\\Omega X. In other words, we have a natural isomorphism : \\\\operatorname{Maps}_*\\\\left(\\\\Sigma X,Y\\\\right) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Maps}_*\\\\left(X,\\\\Omega Y\\\\right) where X and Y are pointed spaces and \\\\operatorname{Maps}_* stands for continuous maps that preserve basepoints. This adjunction can be understood geometrically, as follows: \\\\Sigma X arises out of X if a pointed circle is attached to every non-basepoint of X, and the basepoints of all these circles are identified and glued to the basepoint of X. Now, to specify a pointed map from \\\\Sigma X to Y, we need to give pointed maps from each of these pointed circles to Y. This is to say we need to associate to each element of Xa loop in Y (an element of the loop space \\\\Omega Y), and the trivial loop should be associated to the basepoint of X: this is a pointed map from X to \\\\Omega Y. (The continuity of all involved maps needs to be checked.) The adjunction is thus akin to currying, taking maps on cartesian products to their curried form, and is an example of Eckmann‚ÄìHilton duality. This adjunction is a special case of the adjunction explained in the article on smash products. Desuspension Desuspension is an operation partially inverse to suspension.

The club rapidly expanded and by 1959, the Pagans, originally clad in blue denim jackets and riding Triumphs, began to evolve along the lines of the stereotypical one-percenter motorcycle club. The Pagans are categorized as an outlaw motorcycle gang by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). They are known to fight over territory with the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (HAMC) and other motorcycle clubs. They are active on the East Coast of the U.S. states Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Puerto Rico. Early history The Pagans were established in Prince George's County, Maryland, by then-president Lou Dobkin, beginning in 1957 and officially organized in 1958. The group started out wearing denim jackets with embroidered insignia instead of the more standard three-piece patches utilized by most OMGs, and riding both American and British motorcycles, Harley- Davidsons and Triumphs. Originally they were a \\"brotherhood of 13 motorcyclists. In the 1960s they adopted a formal constitution and formed a governing structure, choosing a national president who was paid the same amount as the U.S. President, which worked out to a $100,000 salary per year. and calling the gesture \\"a show of class.\\" They were a fairly non-violent group until 1965. After gaining a swelling mass of new members which put the Pagans on the path to evolve into an outlaw motorcycle gang (OMG). It was largely a semantic gesture made after they gathered at a motorcycle race in Maryland; the ensuing incident found them branded as \\"The 1% of motorcyclists whom caused problems\\" in local newspapers. The Pagans then both invented and adopted the 1%er patch, referencing the newspaper articles of the time. This 1%er patch quickly adopted by most other OMGs. With ties to other organized crime groups, the Pagans quickly became dominant in the Mid-Atlantic region. They were the only large OMG in that region as well as a large portion of the Northeast USA. Their growth under the leadership of John \\"Satan\\" Marron, saw the Pagans grow to nearly 5,000 members in the early 1970s. Their \\"Mother Club\\" is never in a fixed location, but it has been generally located in the northeast. The Pagans' top echelon of leadership must always number 13 members. There are also chapter presidents, with the largest chapter at times located in the Philadelphia area. Though primarily concentrated in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the Pagans began expanding into Florida in the 1990s and west, with chapters beyond the Mississippi River. The Pagans have grown slowly through a natural cycle of attrition in the smaller OMGs, the practice of patching over other chapters or entire clubs. The practice of incorporating smaller OMGs was prevalent from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Patch The Pagans MC patch depicts the Norse fire-giant Surtr sitting on the sun, wielding a sword, plus the word Pagan's , in red, white and blue. The image of Surtr was taken from an illustration by Jack Kirby in issue 97 of the comic book Journey into Mystery. Though historically not wearing a bottom rocker, a patch denoting the location of where a one-percenter bike club is based, the Pagan Motorcycle club has since started wearing an \\"East Coast\\" insignia on their vests Members wear blue denim vests called cuts or cutoffs with club patches, known as colors, on the front and back. Membership right Recently, the Pagans' membership has begun to grow. Pagans have approximately 1,300+ members and more than 100 chapters and are active along the East Coast of the United States, and Puerto Rico. Chapters are common in Florida, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia and Puerto Rico. The Pagans have a mother club or ruling council which ultimately rules the club. Members must be at least 21 years old and owners of Harley-Davidson motorcycles with engines 1000cc or larger. Criminal activities The Pagans have been linked to the production and smuggling of drugs such as methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and PCP. The Pagans also have had strong ties to organized crime, especially in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Pagans often use puppet clubs, smaller affiliated motorcycle clubs, or small street drug trafficking organizations that support larger outlaw motorcycle gangs for distributing drugs. Pagans have also engaged in assault, arson, extortion, motorcycle/car theft, and weapons trafficking. Most of the violence carried out by the Pagans is directed to rival gangs such as Hells Angels. =New Jersey= On July 17, 1994, at least eight members of the Pagans showed up at the annual charity picnic fund-raiser organized by Tri-County MC in Hackettstown. The Pagans were there to intimidate local motorcycle clubs into aligning with the Pagans so they would have a larger power base to prevent the Hells Angels from getting established in New Jersey. A fight started and escalated from fists to knives and guns. When it was over, Pagans Glenn Ritchie and Diego Vega had been shot dead; Pagan Ron Locke and Tri-County member William Johnson had gunshot wounds, and Tri-County member Hank Riger had his throat cut. Pagans member Robert \\"Hellboy\\" Deronde was convicted of the April 24, 2018 beating of Hells Angels member Jeffrey Shank with a baseball bat at a gas station in Newark, and was sentenced to four years in prison in July 2019.A Pagan‚Äôs biker called ‚ÄòHellboy‚Äô beat a Hells Angels member with a baseball bat. He‚Äôs headed to prison for 4 years. =New York/Pennsylvania= The United States Department of Justice has stated that the Pagans have strong ties to the Philadelphia crime family, involving jewelry burglaries and extortion.NCJRS outlaw motorcycle gangs USA overview On February 23, 2002, 73 Pagans were arrested on Long Island, New York after appearing at an indoor motorcycle and tattoo expo called the Hellraiser Ball. The Pagans had shown up to the event to confront Hells Angels who were at the Ball. Dozens of Pagans rushed the doors of the event and were met with violence by the Hells Angels. Fighting ensued, ten people were wounded, and a Hells Angel shot and killed a Pagans member. Two weeks later, a Pagans-owned tattoo parlor located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was firebombed. In 2005, Pagans allegedly opened fire on and killed the vice-president of the Hells Angels' Philadelphia chapter as he was driving his truck on the Schuylkill Expressway. Later that year, the Hells Angels closed their Philadelphia chapter. In September 2010, nineteen members of the Pagans were arrested in Rocky Point, New York for allegedly conspiring to murder members of the Hells Angels. Charges also include assault, distribution of cocaine and oxycodone, conspiracy to commit extortion and weapons charges. Two federal ATF agents infiltrated the gang, providing key evidence. One agent eventually served as sergeant-at-arms, the second-highest position in the hierarchy. Gang members were heard plotting to murder members of the Hells Angels using homemade hand grenades. =Maryland= A Pagans MC leader, Jay Carl Wagner, 66, was arrested in Washington County, Maryland, by 60-plus officers from state, local and federal officials with a bomb disposal robot on May 9, 2007, and later charged with possession of a regulated firearm after conviction of a violent crime. Police and agents recovered seven handguns, two alleged explosive devices and 13 rifles. On March 5, 2008, Wagner pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. On August 8, 2008, U.S. District Chief Judge Benson E. Legg sentenced Wagner to 30 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. On 6 October 2009, the home of national president David \\"Bart\\" Barbeito in Myersville, Maryland was raided by police. He was arrested on firearms charges. In June, 2010 he pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges. He was sentenced to thirty months' confinement. =Multi-state= In 2009, 55 Pagans members and associates were arrested from West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Florida. Charges range from attempted murder and kidnapping to drug dealing and conspiracy. So far, seven defendants in the case have pleaded guilty. = Rhode Island = In 2018, 49 people, some members of the Pagans MC, were arrested in one of the largest busts in Rhode Island history. The seizure of 53 illegal guns, including a rocket launcher, and a \\"large quantity\\" of marijuana, crack, cocaine, and heroin was the end results of 12-month investigation conducted by members of the Rhode Island State Police Special Investigations Unit with assistance from the Rhode Island Attorney General's office, ATF, and FBI.

He remained in the city of Honolulu through high school, before going on to northern California for his undergraduate‚Äîand eventually graduate‚Äîstudies. Wong received his B.A. in Political Science from Saint Mary's College before joining the Peace Corps in 1963, just two years after its founding. His service in central Thailand teaching English in two different teacher-training colleges heightened his interest in both language- learning and language-teaching. On his return to the US, he received a grant from the East-West Center, and enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, where he began the serious study of Mandarin Chinese. His knowledge of this language advanced greatly at the Inter- University Program in Taipei, where he remained for fifteen months as an EWC grantee. He returned to the EWC in late 1967 to complete his M.A. in Asian Studies. A fellowship from Stanford University in 1968 enabled him to spend the next six years working on his doctorate in traditional Chinese fiction, including a year at the Inter-University Center for advanced learning of Japanese in Tokyo. In 1975, a year after he joined the faculty at Arizona State University, he completed his doctoral dissertation on the Qing dynasty satirist Wu Jingzi (Wu Ching-tzu, 1701-1754), which had been funded by a grant from the Mrs. Giles Whiting Foundation. In 1984-85, he took three different groups of American students to Beijing, as Director of the CIEE (Council for International Educational Exchange) at Peking University. While there, he received and accepted an offer from The Ohio State University, to teach Chinese literature and language at both undergraduate and graduate levels. He remained in Columbus, Ohio, for the next ten years before agreeing to return to Arizona State University as Professor of Chinese, to direct the Center for Asian Studies there. He served in that capacity for seven years before returning to full-time teaching and research, and to start an M.A. program in Chinese and Japanese literature, at the department where he began his professional career. Wong's published research is largely focused on examining premodern Chinese fiction on its own terms, with the idea that knowing the differences between the way the Chinese told their stories and the way Europeans and Americans did is indispensable for a deeper understanding of both. He retired from Arizona State University in 2010, but has continued to publish and to be active at academic conferences. Selected English Publications * Wu Ching-tzu. Boston: G.K.

During the reign of Tokugawa Yoshimune, as a magistrate (machi-bugy≈ç) of Edo, his roles included chief of police, judge and jury, and Yamada Magistrate (Yamada bugy≈ç) prior to his tenure as South Magistrate (Minami Machi-bugy≈ç) of Edo. With the title Echizen no Kami (Governor of Echizen or Lord of the Echizen), he is often known as . He was highly respected as an incorruptible judge. In addition, he established the first fire brigade made up of commoners, and the Koishikawa Yojosho (a city hospital). Later, he advanced to the position of jisha bugy≈ç, and subsequently became daimy≈ç of the Nishi-≈åhira Domain (10,000 koku). ≈åoka was born in 1677, but did not come into public notice until he was 35, when he was appointed an obscure judgeship. When he accepted this job, he found out that there was a long-standing boundary dispute between the farmers of the Yamada and Wakayama (Kish≈´) fiefs. While it was obvious that the Yamada claim was the just one, no previous judge had been fool enough to irritate Yoshimune, Lord of Kish≈´, as he was very close to the shogun, Tokugawa Ietsugu. However, ≈åoka took up the case, and immediately settled it on its merits.Murdoch, James. (1996). A History of Japan, p. 334. Yoshimune was so impressed that when he became sh≈çgun five years later, he took the unusual action of promoting ≈åoka over hundreds of other candidates, to the important post of machi-bugy≈ç (magistrate) of Edo (old name for Tokyo). The post of machi-bugy≈ç combined the duties of mayor, police chief, judge, and fire marshal.  Famous cases  In addition, the figure has taken on a legendary status in a number of stories about his unorthodox and wise legal decisions, frequently used in rakugo. One of the most famous stories is called \\"The Case of the Stolen Smell\\" where he heard the case of a paranoid innkeeper who accused a poor student of literally stealing the fumes of his cooking by eating when the innkeeper was cooking to flavour his dull food. Although his colleagues advised ≈åoka to throw the case out as ridiculous, he decided to hear the case. The judge resolved the matter by ordering the student to pass the money he had in one hand to his other and ruling that the price of the smell of food is the sound of money.Graham, Paul (2012). Defining Property. The bound statue of Jiz≈ç (Shibarare Jiz≈ç) In \\"The Case of the Bound Jiz≈ç or Suspect Statue\\", ≈åoka was called upon to discover the thief of a cartload of cloth from a local kimono maker. ≈åoka ordered a statue of Jiz≈ç of the Narihira-san T≈çsen-ji, a temple in Tokyo, to be bound and brought forth to be called to answer for dereliction of its custodial duty. When the bound statue arrived in the courtroom, the spectators burst into laughter. ≈åoka sternly ordered each spectator to be punished with a token fine for their outburst. Each was ordered to provide a small swatch of cloth as a fine. When the spectators paid their fines, the robbed kimono maker identified the piece of cloth from one spectator as identical to the cloth stolen in the crime. The spectator, who was the actual thief, was arrested, and ≈åoka ordered the Jiz≈ç statue released as having discharged his duty. In 1925, the statue was removed from downtown Tokyo to a little temple called Nanjo-in on its outskirts. The statue still stands, and is wrapped in rope tied by hopeful victims of thieves. However, the statue is worn almost smooth because of over 200 years of binding.  ≈åoka in fiction  ≈åoka Tadasuke has been the central character in two jidaigeki television series. In one, ≈åoka Echizen, actor G≈ç Kat≈ç played the lead. In the other, Meibugy≈ç! ≈åoka Echizen, Kinya Kita≈çji played the same role. In addition, series such as Abarenb≈ç Sh≈çgun have portrayed ≈åoka as an intimate of the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshimune. ≈åoka was portrayed first by Tadashi Yokouchi and later by Ryo Tamura.

In digital systems, a signal is said to be at digital full scale when its magnitude has reached the maximum representable value. Once a signal has reached digital full scale, all headroom has been utilized, and any further increase in amplitude will result in an error known as clipping. The amplitude of a digital signal can be represented in percent, full scale, or decibels, full scale (dBFS). In analog systems, full scale may be defined by the maximum voltage available, or the maximum deflection (full scale deflection or FSD) or indication of an analog instrument such as a moving coil meter or galvanometer. Binary represenation Since binary integer representation range is asymmetrical, full scale is defined using the maximum positive value that can be represented. For example, 16-bit PCM audio is centered on the value 0, and can contain values from ‚àí32,768 to +32,767. A signal is at full-scale if it reaches from ‚àí32,767 to +32,767. (This means that ‚àí32,768, the lowest possible value, slightly exceeds full-scale.) Signal processing in digital audio workstations often uses floating-point arithmetic, which can include values past full-scale, to avoid clipping in intermediate processing stages. In a floating-point representation, a full-scale signal is typically defined to reach from ‚àí1.0 to +1.0. Processing The signal passes through an anti-aliasing, resampling, or reconstruction filter, which may increase peak amplitude slightly due to ringing. It is possible for the analog signal represented by the digital data to exceed digital full scale even if the digital data does not, and vice versa. In the analog domain there is no peak/clipping problem unless the d/a analog circuitry was badly designed. In the digital domain there are no peaks created by these conversions. If a proper (no clipping/saturation) analog signal is converted to digital via A/D with sufficient samples, and then reconverted to analog via D/A, the Nyquist theorem guarantees that there will be no problem in the analog domain due to \\"peak\\" issues because the restored analog signal will be an exact copy of the original analog signal. (However, if the signal is normalized in the digital domain, it may contain \\"intersample peaks\\" which exceed full scale after analog reconstruction.)

When experiments are performed using well-defined surfaces of single-crystalline samples in a continuously pumped ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber, then this experimental technique is often also referred to as thermal desorption spectroscopy or thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS).http://www.uhv.es/sites/marte/includes/doc/tds.pdf Desorption When molecules or atoms come in contact with a surface, they adsorb onto it, minimizing their energy by forming a bond with the surface. The binding energy varies with the combination of the adsorbate and surface. If the surface is heated, at one point, the energy transferred to the adsorbed species will cause it to desorb. The temperature at which this happens is known as the desorption temperature. Thus TPD shows information on the binding energy. Measurement Since TPD observes the mass of desorbed molecules, it shows what molecules are adsorbed on the surface. Moreover, TPD recognizes the different adsorption conditions of the same molecule from the differences between the desorption temperatures of molecules desorbing different sites at the surface, e.g. terraces vs. steps. TPD also obtains the amounts of adsorbed molecules on the surface from the intensity of the peaks of the TPD spectrum, and the total amount of adsorbed species is shown by the integral of the spectrum. To measure TPD, one needs a mass spectrometer, such as a quadrupole mass spectrometer or a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer, under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. The amount of adsorbed molecules is measured by increasing the temperature at a heating rate of typically 2 K/s to 10 K/s. Several masses may be simultaneously measured by the mass spectrometer, and the intensity of each mass as a function of temperature is obtained as a TDS spectrum. The heating procedure is often controlled by the PID control algorithm, with the controller being either a computer or specialised equipment such as a Eurotherm. Other methods of measuring desorption are Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) or using infrared detectors, thermal conductivity detectors etc. Quantitative interpretation of TPD data TDS Spectrum 1 A thermal desorption spectrum of NO absorbed on platinum-rhodium (100) single crystal. The x axis is temperature in kelvins, the unit of the y axis is arbitrary, in fact the intensity of a mass-spectrometer measurement. TDS Spectrum 2 A thermal desorption spectrum of NO absorbed on platinum- rhodium (100) single crystal. The spectra of several NO coverages are combined in one spectrum. The x axis is temperature in kelvins, the unit of the y axis is arbitrary, in fact the intensity of a mass-spectrometer measurement. TDS spectrum 1 and 2 are typical examples of a TPD measurement. Both are examples of NO desorbing from a single crystal in high vacuum. The crystal was mounted on a titanium filament and heated with current. The desorbing NO was measured using a mass spectrometer monitoring the atomic mass of 30. Before 1990 analysis of a TPD spectrum was usually done using a so-called simplified method; the \\"Redhead\\" method, assuming the exponential prefactor and the desorption energy to be independent of the surface coverage. After 1990 and with use of computer algorithms TDS spectra were analyzed using the \\"complete analysis method\\" or the \\"leading edge method\\". These methods assume the exponential prefactor and the desorption energy to be dependent of the surface coverage. Several available methods of analyzing TDS are described and compared in an article by A.M. de JONG and J.W. NIEMANTSVERDRIET. During parameter optimization/estimation, using the integral has been found to create a more well behaved objective function than the differential.  Theoretical Introduction  Thermal desorption is described based on the Arrhenius equation. : r(\\\\sigma) = -\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\sigma}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = v(\\\\sigma) \\\\sigma^n e^{-E_\\\\text{act}(\\\\sigma)/RT}, where : r(\\\\sigma) the desorption rate [mol/(cm2 s)] as a function of \\\\sigma , : n order of desorption, : \\\\sigma surface coverage, : v(\\\\sigma) pre-exponential factor [Hz] as a function of \\\\sigma , : E_\\\\text{act}(\\\\sigma) activation energy of desorption [kJ/mol] as a function of \\\\sigma , : R gas constant [J/(K mol)], : T temperature [K]. This equation is difficult in practice while several variables are a function of the coverage and influence each other. The ‚Äúcomplete analysis method‚Äù calculates the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy at several coverages. This calculation can be simplified. First we assume the pre- exponential factor and the activation energy to be independent of the coverage. We also assume a linear heating rate: (equation 1) : T(t) = T_0 + (\\\\beta t), where: : \\\\beta the heating rate in [K/s], :T_0 the start temperature in [K], :t the time in [s]. We assume that the pump rate of the system is indefinitely large, thus no gasses will absorb during the desorption. The change in pressure during desorption is described as: (equation 2) : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}P}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} + P/\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}(a\\\\,r(t))}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}, where: : P the pressure in the system, : t the time in [s]. : a = A/KV , : A the sample surface [m2], : K a constant, : V volume of the system [m3], : r(t) the desorption rate [mol/(cm2 s)], : \\\\alpha = V/S , : S the pump rate, : V volume of the system [m3], We assume that S is indefinitely large so molecules do not re-adsorp during desorption process and we assume that P/\\\\alpha is indefinitely small compared to \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}P}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} and thus: (equation 3) : a\\\\,r(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}P}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}. Equation 2 and 3 lead to conclude that the desorption rate is a function of the change in pressure. One can use data in an experiment, which are a function of the pressure like the intensity of a mass spectrometer, to determine the desorption rate. Since we assumed the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy to be independent of the coverage. Thermal desorption is described with a simplified Arrhenius equation: (equation 4) : r(t) = -\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\sigma}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = v_n \\\\sigma^n e^{-E_{\\\\mathrm{act}}/RT}, where: : r(t) the desorption rate[mol/(cm2 s)], : n order of desorption, :\\\\sigma surface coverage, : v_n pre-exponential factor [Hz], : E_\\\\text{act} activation energy of desorption [kJ/mol], : R gas constant, : T temperature [K]. Using the before mentioned Redhead method (a method less precise as the \\"complete analysis\\" or the \\"leading edge\\" method) and the temperature maximum T_m one can determine the activation energy: (equation 5) for n=1 : E_\\\\text{act}/{RT_m}^2 = v_1/\\\\beta e^{-E_\\\\text{act}/RT_m}, (equation 6) for n=2 : E_\\\\text{act}/{RT_m}^2 = \\\\sigma_0 v_2/\\\\beta e^{-E_{\\\\mathrm{act}}/RT_m}. M. Ehasi and K. Christmann described a simple method to determine the activation energy of the second order. Equation 6 can be changed into: (equation 6a) : \\\\ln(\\\\sigma_0 {T_m}^2) = -E_\\\\text{act}/RT + \\\\ln({\\\\beta - E_\\\\text{act}/v_2R}), where: \\\\sigma_0 is the surface area of a TDS or TPD peak. A graph of \\\\ln(\\\\sigma_0 T_m) versus 1/T_m results in a straight line with a slope equal to -E_\\\\text{act}/R. Thus in a first-order reaction the T_m is independent of the surface coverage. Changing the surface coverage one can determine n. Usually a fixed value of the pre-exponential factor is used and is \\\\beta known, with these values one can derive the E_\\\\text{act} iteratively from T_m.

Corporate media is mass media production, distribution, ownership, and funding dominated by corporations and their CEOs. Characterizations of mainstream media as \\"corporate\\" may be pejorative insinuations that such media systems do not serve the public interest.Croteau, David and Hoynes, William (2006). The Business of Media: Corporate Media and the Public Interest Pine Forge Press. p. 33  Background  Media critics and public figures such as Robert W. McChesney,McChesney, Robert. \\"Rich Media, Poor Democracy\\" , , University of Illinois Press, 1999; \\"The Problem with the Media\\", , 2004 Ben Bagdikian,Bagdikian, Ben, \\"Media Monopoly\\", , Beacon Press, 2000 Ralph Nader, Jim Hightower,Hightower, Jim, \\"What Liberal Media?\\", \\"There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road Except Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos\\" , , Harper Perennial Press, 1998 Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward S. Herman, Amy Goodman, Tulsi Gabbard and Bernie Sanders suggest that such a media system, especially when allowed to dominate the mainstream media, inevitably will be manipulated by these same corporations to suit their own interests. These critics point out that the main national networks, NBC, CBS, and ABC, as well as most if not all of the smaller cable channels, are owned, funded, and controlled by an interconnected network of large corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, which may manipulate and filter out news that does not fit their corporate agenda. Media companies are slowly understanding how to accelerate the fluidity of media content across delivery channels to \\"expand revenue opportunities, broaden markets and reinforce consumer loyalties and commitments\\". Users are then understanding how to master these various media technologies to bring the flow of media more fully under their control and to interact/co-create with other users. Sometimes, these two forces reinforce each other, creating closer, more rewarding, relations between media producers and consumers. Sometimes the two forces conflict, resulting in constant renegotiations of power between these competing pressures on the new media ecology.  Propaganda model  Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman developed a propaganda model which purports to explain this bias. The common misinterpretation of this model is that all bias is conscious and centralized. The hypothesis is that the process is decentralized and operates as a confluence of factors, that includes the overt pressure from owners and advertisers, but also by the gradual internalization of the biases and values of the corporate owners, leading to self-censorship. American journalist Glenn Greenwald accused mainstream U.S. media of \\"spreading patriotic state propaganda\\".\\"Trump‚Äôs Support and Praise of Despots Is Central to the U.S. Tradition, Not a Deviation From It\\". The Intercept. May 2, 2017. Other factors include the tendency of journalists to avoid doing original research, instead obtaining news from the same few wire services, such as Reuters and Associated Press, which themselves tend to cover the same news under the same perspective. Due to the desire to reduce operation costs, the mainstream media favor news pieces that are pre-made by these news agencies instead of conducting their own reporting.  Impact  = On social justice = Critiques have pointed to the ownership of major news outlets in USA by corporations. Bernie Sanders, an American anti-establishment politician, contends that media are an arm of the ruling class. In his view, \\"corporate media by definition has conflict of interests.\\" He points to alleged low pay of workers in media companies such as Disney which biases them against publishing specials on minimum wage and wealth and income equality. There have been allegations of corporate media's manipulation of presidential campaign facts against Sanders. = Public relations on news and public affairs programming = This same economic pressure makes media susceptible to manipulation by government and other corporate sources through the widespread use of press releases, often created by industry-funded public relations firms. = Impact on world events and society = The point of view and statements made by governments, officials, military, police, national security organizations (such as the FBI and CIA), as well as various other political offices are regularly reported as facts and are published without any (or very little) fact checking by the corporate media. Perhaps the most infamous current example of the impact of the propaganda model on world events and societies was during the two-year period following the 2001 US attacks. During this time, according to a five year in-depth research project conducted by the Centre for Public Integrity; the President of the United States George W. Bush and seven high-ranking officials in his administration made at least 935 false statements about the threat posed to the world and to US national security by Saddam Hussein. These false statements were virtually uncontested by the corporate media and presented as a sound rationale for both the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the \\"War on Terror\\". In Buying the War on PBS, Bill Moyers noted 27 Washington Post editorials supporting George W. Bush's ambitions to invade Iraq. National security correspondent Walter Pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of Bush administration. According to author and journalist Greg Mitchell, \\"By the Post own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information 'got lost', as one Post staffer told Kurtz.\\" The result was the \\"manufacturing of consent\\" for the invasion of Iraq and \\"The Global War on Terror/ism\\" in which hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives to date. As an example, Jessica Yellin on Anderson Cooper 360 admitted being pressured by corporate executives to present positive stories during the run up to the Iraq war.

Factcheck.org (Factcheck.org), created by the Annenberg school of Public Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, found hundreds of misrepresentations in political ads that were never corrected by the mainstream media. Studies also show that those who rely on the media for their information have a poor understanding of the issues and are unable to discern misrepresentations in political advertising. As documented by authors Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber, it is becoming increasingly common for video news releases (VNR) to be created by government and corporations, mimicking TV news story-format, to be used straight into broadcasting in a newscast. Other factors include the cost of litigation. Large corporations tend to sue over any news that are against their interests, causing great expense for the news editors. Even if the litigation is lost, the cost of time and pressure will certainly bias a reporter towards avoiding such possibility. In March 2018, American documentary filmmaker Michael Moore criticized the \\"corporate media\\", saying \\"You turn on the TV, and it's 'Russia, Russia, Russia!' These are all shiny keys to distract us. We should know about the West Virginia strike. What an inspiration that would be. But they don't show this\\".\\"Michael Moore blasts ‚Äúcorporate media‚Äù for only talking about ‚ÄúRussia, Russia, Russia‚Äù\\". Salon. March 20, 2018. Interlocking corporations, corporate power, and its social influences To illustrate the growing problem of monocracy, Bagdikian notes that in the 1980s, \\"less than 1 percent of all corporations, have 87 percent of all sales. [The corporates] are the aristocrats of the American Industrial economy; the remaining 359,500, in terms of their national power, are the peasantry.\\" This conflict continues to arise as \\"dominant media companies are further [integrating] into the ruling forces of the economy.\\" The directorates of major companies interlock with others and control the content of multiple dominating media and information distribution (i.e., newspapers, magazines, radio and television companies, book publishers, film industries, and even multinational banking investors). They become directly influenced by still other powerful industry, creating the \\"Endless Chain\\" of mass media and economic aristocracy (Wardrip-Fruin, 479). In 1993, 90% of media was owned by 50 companies. Today, starting in 2011,the same 90% is controlled by 6 companies. These 6 companies include Comcast, News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. These 6 media companies are broken down into sub companies, for example, News-Corp is broken down into Fox, Wall Street Journal, and New York Post. Disney is broken down into ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Miramar, and Marvel Studios. Viacom is broken down into MTV, Nick Jr, BET, CMT, and Paramount Pictures. Time Warner cable is broken down into CNN, HBO, Time, and Warner Bros. Lastly, CBS is broken down into Showtime, Smithsonian channel, NFL.com, Jeopardy, and 60 minutes. 232 media executives control what media 277 million Americans consume. To put that into perspective, that's 1 media executive to 850,000 media consumers. These six big companies control 70% of cable and can make up to 275.9 billion revenue (2010 revenue for the big six). The media we receive by these 6 companies include movies which in 2010, their box office sales hit 7 billion, which is double what 140 smaller movie studios made. Several issues arise from the fusion; under law and business ethics, the director of a firm is obligated to act in best interest of the company he or she is involved in, and failure to oblige under some circumstances can be a federal crime. This creates a dilemma in the governance of mass media: the same person may be trapped in a situation where working for the best interest for one may damage the other corporation. Another problem which arises is that the same person can abuse his or her power to get away with injustice as exemplified by Bagdikian: \\"When Sears was accused by the Federal Trade Commission of dishonest advertising and promotion, the Tribune was one of the major papers that failed to carry a word of it... (Wardrip-Fruin, 481).\\" Here, a market industry was able to conceal their crime of fraud since it was also interlocked with the news media, one of the main distributors of such significant information. In summary, the concentration of massive media firms that control American public information is troublesome for the potential for deception misleads the public away from reality. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs state that these facts raise fundamental issues as they can bear on social issues and possibly control the shape and direction of the nation's economy. It is further derived that \\"the summits of American business now control or powerfully influence the major media that create American public opinion\\" (Wardrip-Fruin, 483).

In Germany and Austria, the concept of Hauptwohnsitz has special legal ramifications, primarily involving tax. In Austria the Hauptwohnsitzhelp.gv.at - Hauptwohnsitz (German language), accessed 10 August 2009 has an important meaning in the context of financial adjustment between the federation and the local municipalities. On the basis of the census determined number of inhabitants with Hauptwohnsitz, the municipality receives its budget from the federal government. Hauptwohnsitze count themselves for a municipality in two regards: By the direct payment per head, and an increase in premiums after exceeding certain thresholds for the number of inhabitants. This leads to frequent censuses to match the budget of a municipality to its number of inhabitants. In fact, many municipalities are negatively affected by this system. The city of Graz, Austria's second largest city, counts about 260,000 registered Hauptwohnsitze, however, almost 300,000 people do have their main residence there, as there are many students still having their Hauptwohnsitz registered in their hometowns. Since those are not taken into account concerning fiscal distribution, Graz faces serious economic problems. Currently there are campaigns trying to motivate students having their Hauptwohnsitz registered there. The Hauptwohnsitz in Germany is based on the main center of ones' interest (Lebensmittelpunkt).Melderechtsrahmengesetz (German language), ¬ß 12 (2) The Hauptwohnsitz is also the place in which one exercises the right to vote, and where the municipal administration issues a citizen's ID card and passport. The income tax revenue is split between the federal government, the Land government and the municipality where the respective taxpayer has their Hauptwohnsitz. Apart from the Hauptwohnsitz a person can establish multiple secondary places of residence (Nebenwohnsitze, sg. Nebenwohnsitz) where they are also registered as residents but do not have a right to vote. A number of German municipalities impose a secondary- residence tax (Zweitwohnungssteuer) on persons having such a secondary residence, the rationale for that being that they have to provide services to these persons but do not share in their income tax.

They chose to join Adam Warlock and the other cosmic deities in a bid to stop Thanos.Infinity Gauntlet #3 (Sep. 1991) With the other abstract beings, they battled Thanos,Infinity Gauntlet #4 - 5 (Oct. - Nov. 1991) and then battled Nebula when she obtained the Gauntlet from Thanos.Infinity Gauntlet #6 (Dec. 1991) The congress of abstract beings then witnessed Adam Warlock's cosmic trial to determine his worthiness to wield the Infinity Gauntlet.Warlock and The Infinity Watch #1 (Feb. 1991) Lord Chaos and Master Order were next seen among a group of abstract beings questioning the Beyonder from the Dimension of Manifestations.Quasar #38 (Sep. 1992) In Infinity Crusade it is learned that they must obey the dictates of Eternity and Infinity. During the Time Runs Out storyline, the Beyonders are revealed to have killed Lord Chaos, Master Order, and the In-Betweener as part of destroying abstract entities in each reality across the multiverse.New Avengers vol. 3 #30 (April 2015) Following the restoration of the universe after the Secret Wars, Lord Chaos along with Master Order became disgruntled by Galactus' evolution from a force of destruction to a force of creation.Ultimates (Vol 2) #6 They eventually put Galactus on trial before the Living Tribunal. The Tribunal ruled in Galactus' favor and allowed him to remain in his new form, claiming that the universe being in a new iteration meant the cosmic hierarchy wasn't established anew. Master Order and Lord Chaos took this council to heart, and murdered the Tribunal in order to take his place as the personification of multiversal law.Ultimates 2 (Vol 2) #2 They attempted to turn Galactus back to his world- devourer form. However, for the same reason Order and Chaos could kill the Living Tribunal, they couldn't stop Galactus from fighting back his transformation. If there wasn't a heriarchy yet, it meant Galactus was also on the same level as Order and Chaos, so they couldn't impose their will on him. Because of this, Order and Chaos traveled to their servant, the In-Betweener, and forced him to become the uniting force in a fusion that combined Master Order and Lord Chaos into a single being, the self-proclaimed new order, Logos.Ultimates 2 (Vol 2) #3 Powers and abilities Lord Chaos is an abstract being who embodies the metaphysical concept of Chaos; as such it has no physical form, although on occasion it has manifested as an image of a disembodied bald inhumanly warped and distorted male head. It has been implied that Lord Chaos, and its counterpart, Master Order, have vast powers which they use to manipulate events within their sphere of influence in subtle ways. It is known that, through some as yet unknown process, Lord Chaos and Master Order worked together to create the metaphysical being known as the In- Betweener. Thanos wielding the Infinity Gauntlet ranked Lord Chaos' scale of power as above that of Galactus, but below that of Eternity.Thanos Annual #1 (2014) However later he and Master Order were able to easily kill Living Tribunal by blasting him with energy and also defeat Lifebringer Galactus after transforming into Logos.Ultimates 2 #2 Other versions Lord Chaos and Master Order battle Thanos once more in an alternate universe when he possesses the Heart of the Universe.Marvel: The End #1 - 6 (2003) References External links * Lord Chaos at Marvel.com Category:Characters created by Jim Starlin Category:Marvel Comics abstract concepts ","title":"Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)"},{"id":"1251803","text":"A seed is an encased plant embryo.

On its eastern side the gulf is bordered by the Adelaide Plains and the Fleurieu Peninsula. To the south it is defined by a line from Troubridge Point on Yorke Peninsula to Cape Jervis on Fleurieu Peninsula. Its entrances from the southwest are from Investigator Strait, and to the southeast from Backstairs Passage, which separate Kangaroo Island from the mainland. Adelaide, the South Australian capital, lies midway along the gulf's east shore. Other towns located on the gulf, from west to east include Edithburgh, Port Vincent, Ardrossan and Port Wakefield and Normanville. The Aboriginal name given to it by the original inhabitants of the area was Wongajerla. It was named Gulph of St. Vincent by Matthew Flinders on 30 March 1802, in honour of Admiral John Jervis (1st Earl of St Vincent). It was shortly afterwards (after his meeting with Flinders at Encounter Bay on 8 April 1802) mapped by Nicolas Baudin, who named it Golfe de la Mauvaise or Golfe de la Misanthrophie. In the following year Louis de Freycinet renamed it Golphe Josephine to honour Josephine Bonaparte.Eric Wolanski (editor), Estuaries of Australia in 2050 and Beyond, Dordrecht: Springer, 2014, p.155 ( & ) Due to Flinders' lengthy imprisonment on Mauritius during his return to England, the publication of Baudin's map preceded that of Flinders by three years. The Adelaide Desalination Plant which is located on Gulf St Vincent's eastern shore in Lonsdale, supplies the Adelaide metropolitan area with desalinated water from the gulf. It officially opened in 2013. Environment The Gulf teems with crustacea and polychaeta, as well as various species of sea squirts and sea urchins. The benthos is a soft sediment shelf, with species of zosteraceae around the mouth of the Port River. The cardinalfish genus Vincentia takes its name from Gulf St Vincent where the type specimen of its type species was collected.

Houses on The Block were purchased over a period of 30 years by the Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC) for use as a project in Aboriginal-managed housing. The Block is probably the most famous feature of the suburb of Redfern, although it is located on the western border of that suburb, on the edge of Darlington. The focus of life in The Block has always been Eveleigh Street, which is its eastern border, with railway lines on the other side of that street. 'The Block' is an area in the immediate vicinity of Redfern station bounded by Eveleigh, Caroline, Louis and Vine Streets. The area around The Block is now reportedly the subject of plans for massive redevelopment by private developers at the instigation of the New South Wales state government (see Redfern-Eveleigh-Darlington). 1972 transfer to the Aboriginal Housing Company In 1965, Charles Perkins and Reverend Ted Noffs of the Wayside Chapel organised a Freedom Ride with 30 white Sydney University students from the group Student Action for Aborigines (SAFA). This inspired Koori political activists, awakened positive media interest and commenced an era of protests. The Block has historically been the subject of large protests, starting in the early 1970s, when landlords in the area conducted a campaign of evicting all Aboriginal residents. A group of campaigners, led by future judge Bob Bellear, successfully lobbied the Whitlam government for a grant which allowed the AHC to commence purchasing houses in 1972. The area was significant as an affordable source of low-cost housing for disadvantaged Aboriginal people. As a pioneering and still unique project in Aboriginal-run housing near the centre of Australia's largest city, it excites enormous emotions, and moreover is viewed by the largely rural Indigenous population of New South Wales as a pied-√†-terre and spiritual home in Australia's largest city. For non- Aboriginal people, The Block has assumed a notorious reputation for violence and crime. In 2004, the Aboriginal Housing Company decided to raze part of The Block that had deteriorated into a slum. 2004 Redfern riot On 14 February 2004, The Block was the scene of 2004 Redfern riots following the death of an Australian Aboriginal boy, TJ Hickey. Hickey died after, while on bike, he collided with a protruding gutter, was flung into the air and was impaled on a 2.5-metre-high fence outside a block of units off Phillip Street, Waterloo, possibly whilst being followed by police. Police officers at the scene administered first aid until NSW Ambulance officers arrived. The Australian First Aid Manual requires the instrument of penetration to remain in place after the injury has occurred, as removal of a penetrating instrument usually causes catastrophic bleeding. The police removed TJ Hickey's body from where it was impaled on the fence before the ambulance arrived, contrary to Australian First Aid accepted practice. Hickey was transported from the scene to the Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical but stable condition. He died with his family by his side on 15 February due to the severity of his wounds. Post riot The present Redfern railway station was damaged by fire in the 2004 Redfern riots. The ticketing area and station master's office were significantly damaged - and the windows in the front of the station were bricked up for almost a year afterwards to prevent further attacks. They have since been replaced with glass windows. The AHC's plan for the redevelopment of The Block, known as The Pemulwuy Project, has been met with some opposition by the State Government.

Following the release of the extended play Transistor Revolt in 2000, the band signed with Fat Wreck Chords and began working on the album at Sonic Iguana Studios with producer Mass Giorgini. Musically, The Unraveling is rooted in melodic hardcore, with lyrical themes that include friendships, relationships, and memories. Although it failed to peak within any record charts, The Unraveling received positive reviews from music critics. After its release, guitarist Dan Wleklinski left the band due to personal differences with lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, and was eventually replaced with Todd Mohney. In 2005, Fat Wreck Chords reissued The Unraveling to coincide with Rise Against's fifth anniversary. Background and recording Rise Against was formed in 1999 after the dissolution of the Chicago punk rock band 88 Fingers Louie. Bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Dan Wleklinski were still interested in making music, and decided to start a new band. The two recruited drummer Toni Tintari, guitarist Kevin White, and lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, the former lead vocalist of the punk band Baxter. They called themselves Transistor Revolt, and released the extended play Transistor Revolt in 2000. Transistor Revolt garnered the attention of Fat Mike, the co-founder of the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. He signed the band to a recording contract in 2000, with the stipulation they change their name; the band members ultimately decided on the name Rise Against. After signing with Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left Rise Against; Tintari was replaced by Brandon Barnes shortly thereafter. With a new drummer, the band members began to work on The Unraveling at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana, where Principe and Wleklinski had previously recorded material for 88 Fingers Louie. Recording took place over the course of five weeks, with Mass Giorgini serving as the producer, and Wleklinski serving as the assistant engineer. Wleklinski later remarked on the grueling workdays: \\"12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22-24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of 'If you don't play it right, you have to play it again,' not 'That was good enough, I'll edit it so it's on time.'\\" Wleklinski also commented that it was difficult to split his time between recording guitar parts and engineering the songs, and that during the last week he had to sleep on the studio floor. Style and composition The Unraveling is primarily a melodic hardcore record, with influences of punk rock and hardcore punk. Shawn Merrill of Exclaim! compared the album to works by other punk rock bands like Agnostic Front, Bad Religion, Gorilla Biscuits, and Minor Threat. The Unraveling begins with a quote by actor and musician Jack Black asking the listener if they \\"are ready to rock\\", which is taken from the 1996 film The Cable Guy. It then transitions into the first track \\"Alive and Well\\", a fast-paced song that combines screaming vocals with melodies in the chorus. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic considers the second track, \\"My Life Inside Your Heart\\", to be the most accessible song on the album, while \\"Great Awakening\\" has a \\"frantic pace\\" with a hardcore sound. The next song \\"Six Ways 'Til Sunday\\" is more inspired by punk rock, with a long closing group chant. Boy notes that tracks five through ten alternate between short hardcore songs like \\"The Art of Losing\\" and \\"Remains of Summer Memories\\", and more conventional sounding songs like \\"The Unraveling\\". The eleventh track, \\"Everchanging\\", begins with minimal background music to highlight McIlrath's vocals. After two more hardcore songs, \\"1000 Good Intentions\\" begins playing, which James Benwell of Drowned in Sound compared to \\"Everchanging\\". Boy adds that the track is reminiscent of the sound of future Rise Against albums, with its punk base combined with more mainstream rock influence. The final two tracks, \\"Weight of Time\\" and \\"Faint Resemblance\\", close the album in a \\"nice summation of everything that has come before them\\", according to Boy. Lyrically, The Unraveling is intended to be thought-provoking, with themes ranging from \\"friendships and relationships [to] religion and memories\\". Release and reception =Release= Fat Wreck Chords released The Unraveling on April 24, 2001, in the United States on CD and LP formats; the original 2001 CD pressing is currently out of print. It failed to reach any major music chart, and did not produce a single. Since the album's release, some of its songs have been featured in compilation albums and other media. An acoustic rendition of \\"Everchanging\\" was included on the Warped Tour 2006 Tour Compilation and the European track listing of the 2007 extended play This Is Noise. \\"The Art of Losing\\" and \\"My Life Inside Your Heart\\" were to be used in the unreleased video game Propeller Arena. To promote The Unraveling, Rise Against toured extensively throughout North America and Europe. While on tour, Wleklinski left the band due to personal differences with McIlrath. Rumor spread that Wleklinski was fired because of his long hair, although McIlrath derided these claims. Phillip Hill stood in as lead guitarist, and Kevin White was eventually hired as a replacement. A few months later, White left the band, and Todd Mohney was recruited as the new lead guitarist. In 2005, Fat Wreck Chords reissued The Unraveling on CD and digital download format to coincide with the band's fifth anniversary. It was remixed and remastered by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with two bonus songs (\\"Join the Ranks\\" and \\"Gethsemane\\"), updated photography, and additional album liner information. Mohney plays lead guitar on \\"Gethsemane\\", as the track was recorded after Wlekinski's departure. =Critical reception= The Unraveling received positive reviews upon its initial release. Merrill praised the album's music, and described Rise Against as the \\"hardcore salvation\\" he had been waiting for. Boy wrote that he was initially skeptical about listening to the album, but ultimately called it \\"a surprisingly accomplished work that contains all of the band's trademark strengths\\". He also highlighted the musicianship between the band members. Benwell noted that while the music was not innovative, it was still a \\"perfectly formed slab of uplifting punk rock\\", and recommended the album to any hardcore punk fans. AllMusic's Kurt Morris commented that Rise Against was different than other Fat Wreck Chords bands at the time, as there was no poppy songs or juvenile humor in the lyrics. He felt that the music was \\"pure and unadulterated\\", and that The Unraveling would revitalize moshing. The 2005 reissue was also met with positive reviews. AltSounds highlighted the improved sound quality and called it a \\"must have for any Rise Against fan\\". Sputnikmusic also noted the improved sound quality, but criticized the positioning of each song in the track list. The reviewer wrote that certain songs felt out of place when paired next to each other, and wondered why the track listing had not been altered for the reissue.

Physical methods Different procedures may be used to crack a safe, depending on its construction. Different procedures are required to open different safes so safe-crackers need to be aware of the differences. = Lock manipulation = Lock manipulation is the stereotypical safe cracking technique commonly portrayed in movies. It is a damage free combination recovery method, and a well known surreptitious bypass technique. Manipulation only requires fingers, eyes, and proper technique though it is a skill that takes years to develop and decades to master. While manipulation of combination locks is usually performed on Group 2 locks, many Group 1 locks are susceptible to manipulation. Expert practitioners of this art can open locks with speed and consistency. These professionals manually manipulate Archived from the original on December, 9, 2016 the lock in order to obtain the combination one number at a time. Manipulation procedures can vary, but they all rely on exploiting the presence of mechanical imperfections in the lock. Manipulation will unlock a safe and recover its combination. Once the combination is recovered it may be reused to open the safe lock. Similar damage free bypass can also be completed by a computerized auto-dialer or manipulation robot. These auto-dialerArchived August 1, 2017 machines are known to take 24 hours or more to reach the correct combination. In recent years faster devices have been engineered for lock bypass. These new devices use more advanced robotics and more advanced software. When used in cooperation with each other the two technologies closely mimic manual manipulation. These devices mimic human manipulation by \\"feeling\\" and measuring mechanical movement within the lock. Mechanical safe locks are manipulated primarily by feel and vision, with sound helping the process occasionally. To find the combination the operator uses the lock against itself by measuring internal movements with the dial numbers. More sophisticated locks use advanced mechanics to reduce any feedback a technician could use to identify a combination. These group 1 archived from original June 28, 2017 locks were developed in response to group 2archived from original on June 28, 2017 lock manipulation.archived from original on August 9, 2016. Wheels made from lightweight materials will reduce valuable sensory feedback, but are mainly used for improved resistance against radiographic attacks. Archived from the original on June 28, 2017. Manipulation is often the preferred choice in lost-combination lockouts, since it requires no repairs or damage, but can be time consuming for an operator, the specific difficulty depends on the unique wheel shapes and where the gates rest in relation to them. A novice's opening time will be governed by these random inconsistencies, while some leading champions of this art show admirable consistency. There are also a number of tools on the market to assist safe engineers in manipulating a combination lock open in the field. Nearly all combination locks allow some \\"slop\\" while entering a combination on the dial. On average 1% radial rotation in either direction from the center of the true combination number to allow the fence to fall despite slight deviation, so that for a given safe it may be necessary only to try a subset of the combinations. Such \\"slops\\" may allow for a margin of error of plus or minus two digits, which means that trying multiples of five would be sufficient in this case. This drastically reduces the time required to exhaust the number of meaningful combinations. A further reduction in solving time is obtained by trying all possible settings for the last wheel for a given setting of the first wheels before nudging the next-to-last wheel to its next meaningful setting, instead of zeroing the lock each time with a number of turns in one direction. = Guessing the combination = Safes may be compromised surprisingly often by simply guessing the combination. This results from the fact that manufactured safes often come with a manufacturer- set combination. These combinations (known as try-out combinations) are designed to allow owners initial access to the safes so that they may set their own new combinations. Sources exist which list manufacturers' try-out combinations. Combinations are also unwittingly compromised by the owners of the safes by having the locks set to easy-to-guess combinations such as a birthdate, street address, or driver's license number.  List of common factory-default combinations  * 50-25-50 * 50-50-50 * 20-50-25 * 10-20-30 * 25-50-75 * 20-40-60 * 20-60-40 * 40-20-60 * 40-60-20 * 60-20-40 * 60-40-20 = Autodialers = A number of companies and groups have developed autodialing machines to open safes. Unlike fictional machines that can open any combination in a matter of seconds, such machines are usually specific to a particular type of lock and must cycle through thousands of combinations to open a device. A good example of such a device is a project completed by two students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Kyle Vogt and Grant Jordan. Their machine, built to open a Sargent and Greenleaf 8500 lock on a Diebold Safe, found an unknown combination in 21,000 tries. Lockmasters, Inc. markets one autodialing machine [QX3 Combi Autodialer (LKMCOMBI)] that work on a variety of 3 and 4 Wheel combination safe locks. There also exist computer- aided manipulation tools such as Mas Hamilton's SoftDrill (no longer in production). These tools are similar to autodialers, except they make measurements of the internal components of the lock, and deduce the combination in a similar way to that of a human safe technician. = Weak- point drilling = Safe-drilling w/ drill rig While some safes are hard to open, some are susceptible to compromise by drilling or other physical methods. Manufacturers publish drill-point diagrams for specific models of safes. These are tightly guarded by both the manufacturers and locksmithing professionals. Drilling is usually aimed at gaining access to the safe by observation or bypass of the locking mechanism. Drilling is the most common method used by locksmiths, and is commonly used in cases of burglary attempts, malfunctioning locks or damaged locks. In observational attacks, the drill hole allows the safecracker to view the internal state of the combination lock. Drill-points are often located close to the axis of the dial on the combination lock, but observation may sometimes require drilling through the top, sides or rear of the safe. While observing the lock, the locksmith manipulates the dial to align the lock gates so that the fence falls and the bolt is disengaged. Bypass attacks involve physical manipulation of the bolt mechanism directly, bypassing the combination lock. All but the simplest safes are designed to protect against drilling attacks through the implementation of hardplate steel (extremely wear-resistant) or composite hardplate (a casting of metal such as cobalt-vanadium alloys with embedded tungsten carbide chips designed to shatter the cutting tips of a drill bit) within the safe, protecting the locking mechanism and other critical areas such as the locking bolts. The use of hardplate ensures that conventional drilling is not successful when used against the safe. Drilling through hardplate requires the use of special-purpose diamond or tungsten-carbide drill-bits. Even then, this can be a time-consuming and difficult process with safes equipped with modern composite hardplates. Some high-security safes use a glass relocker. This is a piece of tempered glass mounted between the safe door and the combination lock. It has wires attached to the edges. These wires lead to randomly located, spring-loaded bolts. If an attempt is made to penetrate the safe, the penetrating drill or torch could break the glass and release the bolts. These bolts block the retraction of the main locking bolts. To drill a safe with a glass relocker, side, top, or rear drilling may be necessary. A gas abrasive drill can sometimes be used to drill through a glass relocker without triggering it. Many modern high-security safes also incorporate thermal relockers in conjunction with glass-based relockers (usually a fusible link as part of the relocker cabling), which also activate when the temperature of a safe exceeds a certain level as a defense against torches and thermal lances. Drilling is an attractive method of safecracking for locksmiths, as it is usually quicker than manipulation, and drilled safes can generally be repaired and returned to service. Punching, peeling and using a torch are other methods of compromising a safe. The punch system is widely used by criminals for rapid entry. Punching was developed by Pavle Stanimirovic and used in New York City. Peeling is a method that involves removing the outer skin of the safe. Plasma cutters and thermal lances can be as hot as , much hotter than traditional oxyacetylene torches, and can be used to burn through the metal on a safe. = Scoping = Scoping a safe is the process of drilling a hole and inserting a borescope into the safe to get an intimate look into a specific part of the security container. When manipulation proof mechanical locks and glass re- lockers are implemented as security measures, scoping is the most practical option. One common method is called \\"scoping the change key hole.\\" The safecracker will drill a hole allowing him to get his scope into a position to observe the change key hole. While spinning the dial and looking through the change key hole for certain landmarks on the combination lock's wheel pack, it is possible to obtain the combination and then dial open the safe with the correct combination. This method is common for a professional safe specialist because it leaves the lock in good working order and only simple repairs are needed to bring the safe barrier back to its original condition. It is also a common way to bypass difficult hard plates and glass re-lockers since the change key hole can be scoped by drilling the top, side, or back of the container. = Brute force methods = Other methods of cracking a safe generally involve damaging the safe so that it is no longer functional. These methods may involve explosives or other devices to inflict severe force and damage the safe so it may be opened. Examples of penetration tools include acetylene torches, drills, and thermal lances. This method requires care as the contents of the safe may be damaged. Safe-crackers can use what are known as jam shots to blow off the safe's doors. Most modern safes are fitted with 'relockers' (like the one described above) which are triggered by excessive force and will then lock the safe semi-permanently (a safe whose relocker has tripped must then be forced, the combination or key alone will no longer suffice). This is why a professional safe-technician will use manipulation rather than brute force to open a safe so they do not risk releasing the relocker. = Radiological methods = Penetrating radiation such as X-ray radiation can be used to reveal the internal angular relationship of the wheels gates to the flys mechanism to deduce the combination. Some modern safe locks are made of lightweight materials such as nylon to inhibit this technique, since most safe exteriors are made of much denser metals. The Chubb Manifoil Mk4 combination lock contains a lead shield surrounding part of the lock to defeat such attempts to read its wheels. = Tunneling into bank vaults = Large bank vaults which are often located underground have been compromised by safe-crackers who have tunneled in using digging equipment. This method of safe-cracking has been countered by building patrol-passages around the underground vaults. These patrol-passages allow early detection of any attempts to tunnel into a vault. = Safe bouncing = A number of inexpensive safes sold to households for under $100 use mechanical locking mechanisms that are vulnerable to bouncing. Many cheap safes use a magnetic locking pin to prevent lateral movement of an internal locking bolt, and use a solenoid to move the pin when the correct code is entered. This pin can also be moved by the impact of the safe being dropped or struck while on its side, which allows the safe to be opened. One security researcher taught his three- year-old son how to open most consumer gun safes. More expensive safes use a gear mechanism that is less susceptible to mechanical attacks. Electronic methods Electronic locks are not vulnerable to traditional manipulation techniques. These locks are often compromised through power analysis attacks. Several tools exist that can automatically retrieve or reset the combination of an electronic lock; notably, the Little Black Box and Phoenix. Tools like these are often connected to wires in the lock that can be accessed without causing damage to the lock or container. Nearly all high-end, consumer-grade electronic locks are vulnerable to some form of electronic attack. = TEMPEST = The combinations for some electronic locks can be retrieved by examining electromagnetic emissions coming from the lock. Because of this, many safe locks used to protect critical infrastructure are tested and certified to resist TEMPEST attacks. These include the Kaba Mas X-10 and S&G; 2740B, which are FF-L-2740B compliant.  Keypad-based attacks  If an electronic lock accepts user input from a keypad, this process can be observed in order to reveal the combination. Common attacks include: * Visually observing a user enter the combination (shoulder surfing) * Hiding a camera in the room which records the user pressing keys * Examining fingerprints left on the keys * Placing certain gels, powders, or substances on the keys that can be smudged or transferred between keys when the combination is entered, and observed at a later time. * Placing a \\"skimmer\\" (akin to those used for credit card fraud) behind the keypad to record the digital signals that are sent to the lock body when the combination is entered. * Examining wear or deformity of buttons which are pressed more often than others Many of these techniques require the attacker to tamper with the keypad, wait for the unsuspecting user to enter the combination, and return at a later time to retrieve the information. These techniques are sometimes used by members of intelligence or law enforcement agencies, as they are often effective and surreptitious. = High-security keypads = Some keypads are designed to inhibit the aforementioned attacks. This is usually accomplished by restricting the viewing angle of the keypad (either by using a mechanical shroud or special buttons), or randomizing the positions of the buttons each time a combination is entered. Some keypads use small LED or LCD displays inside of the buttons to allow the number on each button to change. This allows for randomization of the button positions, which is normally performed each time the keypad is powered on. The buttons usually contain a lenticular screen in front of the display, which inhibits off-axis viewing of the numbers. When properly implemented, these keypads make the \\"shoulder surfing\\" attack infeasible, as the combination bears no resemblance to the positions of the keys which are pressed. While these keypads can be used on safes and vaults, this practice is uncommon. Media depictions Movies often depict a safe-cracker determining the combination of a safe lock using his fingers or a sensitive listening device to determine the combination of a rotary combination lock. Other films also depict an elaborate scheme of explosives and other devices to open safes. Some of the more famous works include: * Payday: The Heist (2011) * Payday 2 (2013-2016) * A Retrieved Reformation (1909) * The Asphalt Jungle (1950) * Rififi (1955) * The Cracksman (1963) * You Only Live Twice (1967) * Who's Minding the Mint?

While the team was able to blow the door off of a safe by filling the safe with water and detonating an explosive inside it, the contents of the safe were destroyed and filling the safe with water required sealing it from the inside. The safe had also sprung many leaks.

Berry is the Geraldine R. Segal Professor of American Social Thought where she teaches American legal history at the Department of History, School of Arts & Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the former chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Previously, Berry was provost of the College of Behavioral and Social Science at University of Maryland, College Park, and was the first African American chancellor of the University of Colorado at Boulder. Early life and education Berry was born in Nashville, Tennessee,Contemporary Black Biography. Ed. Barbara Carlisle Bigelow. Vol. 7. Detroit: Gale, 1994. p11-15. the second of the three children of George Ford and Frances Berry (n√©e Southall). Because of economic hardship and family circumstances, she and her older brother were placed in an orphanage for a time. Berry attended Nashville's segregated schools. In 1956, she graduated with honors from Pearl High School. She attending Fisk University in Nashville, where her primary interests were philosophy, history, and chemistry. Berry transferred to Howard University, where in 1961 she received her B.A. In 1962, she received her M.A. from Howard. In 1966, Berry received a PhD in American constitutional history from the University of Michigan. In 1970, she earned a J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School. Career Berry spent six years working at the University of Maryland, eventually becoming interim provost of the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences. In 1976, she became chancellor of the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, the first black woman to head a major research university. In 1977, Berry took a leave of absence from the University of Colorado when President Jimmy Carter named her assistant secretary for education in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In 1980, Berry left the Department of Education to return to Howard University as a professor of history and law. Carter appointed her to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, where during her tenure she became involved in legal battles with Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan. When Reagan attempted to remove her from the board, she successfully went to court to keep her seat. She clashed frequently on the commission with the Reagan-appointed chairman, Clarence M. Pendleton Jr. Pendleton tried to move the commission in line with Reagan's social and civil rights views and aroused the ire of liberals and feminists. He served from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988.The Washington Post, December 17, 2001 In 1984, Berry co-founded the Free South Africa Movement, dedicated to the abolition of apartheid in South Africa. She was one of three prominent Americans arrested at the South African Embassy in Washington the day before Thanksgiving; the timing was deliberate to ensure maximum news exposure. In 1987, Berry took a tenured chair at the University of Pennsylvania, while continuing to serve on the Civil Rights Commission. In 1993, Berry book The Politics of Parenthood: Child Care, Women's Rights, and the Myth of the Good Mother was published. Reviewing the book in The Christian Science Monitor, Laura Van Tuyl stated, \\"Berry presents a dispassionate history of the women's movement, day care, and home life, showing the persistent obstacles to economic and political power that have confronted women as a result of society's definition of them as 'mothers.' Her heavily footnoted chronology attributes the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment, the languishing of the women's movement in the '80s, and years of bickering over federal parental-leave and child care bills to an unwillingness to rethink gender roles.\\" In 1993, Berry was also appointed chair of the Civil Rights Commission by President Bill Clinton, who reappointed her for another term in 1999. Separately from her work on the Civil Rights Commission, Berry was named chair of the Pacifica Radio Foundation's National Board in June 1997. She drew controversy from listeners, programmers, and station staff, after she and the board attempted to modify programming in order to expand the listeners of the stations and to attract a more diverse audience. \\"White male hippies over 50,\\" is how Berry described the programmers and audience of KPFA in Berkeley. Rumors of board actions involving the sale of flagship stations such as KPFA were widely circulated by the programmers. (Unlike most public service stations, Pacifica stations hold valuable high wattage licenses at commercial frequencies in major urban markets including New York City.) In 1999 she and Pacifica's Executive Director Lynn Chadwick fired the station's manager and issued a gag order, threatening to fire anyone else who worked at the station who spoke of their actions. Berry thereafter ordered a lockout of all KPFA personnel, in violation of station union agreements. She then proceeded to demand the imposition of racial preferences across the board at KPFA, though she refused to meet with minority staff people at the station, who mostly disagreed with her actions. Berry's actions in connection with Pacifica Radio brought protest from free speech groups such as the ACLU. She subsequently resigned from the Pacifica board. She continued to serve as chair of the Civil Rights Commission. In 1999, Berry persuaded the Clinton administration to appoint Victoria Wilson, her editor at Alfred A. Knopf, to the commission. In 2001, she and the Democratic board members of the commission barred the seating of Peter Kirsanow, who had been appointed by President George W. Bush to replace Wilson on the commission. Berry and the Democratic bloc argued that Wilson was entitled to serve a full six-year term, but the Bush Administration contended that she had only been appointed to serve out the remainder of a previous member's term. Kirsanow sued, claiming Wilson's tenure had expired and he had been validly appointed. Wilson won in federal district court but ultimately lost on appeal in 2002, and the court ordered the seating of Kirsanow. The dispute determined which political party would have a majority of the board's members. Berry left office before the expiration of her term in late 2004 and was succeeded by Gerald A. Reynolds.

A fertile soil has the following properties: * The ability to supply essential plant nutrients and water in adequate amounts and proportions for plant growth and reproduction; and * The absence of toxic substances which may inhibit plant growth. The following properties contribute to soil fertility in most situations: * Sufficient soil depth for adequate root growth and water retention; * Good internal drainage, allowing sufficient aeration for optimal root growth (although some plants, such as rice, tolerate waterlogging); * Topsoil or horizon Oo is with sufficient soil organic matter for healthy soil structure and soil moisture retention; * Soil pH in the range 5.5 to 7.0 (suitable for most plants but some prefer or tolerate more acid or alkaline conditions); * Adequate concentrations of essential plant nutrients in plant- available forms; * Presence of a range of microorganisms that support plant growth. In lands used for agriculture and other human activities, maintenance of soil fertility typically requires the use of soil conservation practices. This is because soil erosion and other forms of soil degradation generally result in a decline in quality with respect to one or more of the aspects indicated above. Soil scientists use the capital letters O, A, B, C, and E to identify the master horizons, and lowercase letters for distinctions of these horizons. Most soils have three major horizons‚Äîthe surface horizon (A), the subsoil (B), and the substratum (C). Some soils have an organic horizon (O) on the surface, but this horizon can also be buried. The master horizon, E, is used for subsurface horizons that have a significant loss of minerals (eluviation). Hard bedrock, which is not soil, uses the letter R. Soil fertilization Bioavailable phosphorus is the element in soil that is most often lacking. Nitrogen and potassium are also needed in substantial amounts. For this reason these three elements are always identified on a commercial fertilizer analysis. For example, a 10-10-15 fertilizer has 10 percent nitrogen, 10 percent (P2O5) available phosphorus and 15 percent (K2O) water- soluble potassium. Sulfur is the fourth element that may be identified in a commercial analysis‚Äîe.g. 21-0-0-24 which would contain 21% nitrogen and 24% sulfate. Inorganic fertilizers are generally less expensive and have higher concentrations of nutrients than organic fertilizers. Also, since nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium generally must be in the inorganic forms to be taken up by plants, inorganic fertilizers are generally immediately bioavailable to plants without modification.Brady N., Weil R. 2002 Nitrogen and sulfur economy of soils. pp. 543-571 in Helba (ed.), The Nature and properties of soils. Pearson Education, NJ. However, some have criticized the use of inorganic fertilizers, claiming that the water-soluble nitrogen doesn't provide for the long-term needs of the plant and creates water pollution. Slow-release fertilizers may reduce leaching loss of nutrients and may make the nutrients that they provide available over a longer period of time. Soil fertility is a complex process that involves the constant cycling of nutrients between organic and inorganic forms. As plant material and animal wastes are decomposed by micro-organisms, they release inorganic nutrients to the soil solution, a process referred to as mineralization. Those nutrients may then undergo further transformations which may be aided or enabled by soil micro- organisms. Like plants, many micro-organisms require or preferentially use inorganic forms of nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium and will compete with plants for these nutrients, tying up the nutrients in microbial biomass, a process often called immobilization. The balance between immobilization and mineralization processes depends on the balance and availability of major nutrients and organic carbon to soil microorganisms.Sims, G. K., and M. M. Wander. 2002. Proteolytic activity under nitrogen or sulfur limitation. Appl. Soil Ecol. 568:1-5.Sims, G.K. 2006. Nitrogen Starvation Promotes Biodegradation of N-Heterocyclic Compounds in Soil. Soil Biology & Biochemistry 38:2478-2480. Natural processes such as lightning strikes may fix atmospheric nitrogen by converting it to (NO2). Denitrification may occur under anaerobic conditions (flooding) in the presence of denitrifying bacteria. Nutrient cations, including potassium and many micronutrients, are held in relatively strong bonds with the negatively charged portions of the soil in a process known as cation exchange. In 2008 the cost of phosphorus as fertilizer more than doubled, while the price of rock phosphate as base commodity rose eight-fold. Recently the term peak phosphorus has been coined, due to the limited occurrence of rock phosphate in the world. Light and CO2 limitations Photosynthesis is the process whereby plants use light energy to drive chemical reactions which convert CO2 into sugars. As such, all plants require access to both light and carbon dioxide to produce energy, grow and reproduce. While typically limited by nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, low levels of carbon dioxide can also act as a limiting factor on plant growth. Peer-reviewed and published scientific studies have shown that increasing CO2 is highly effective at promoting plant growth up to levels over 300 ppm. Further increases in CO2 can, to a very small degree, continue to increase net photosynthetic output. Soil depletion Soil depletion occurs when the components which contribute to fertility are removed and not replaced, and the conditions which support soil's fertility are not maintained. This leads to poor crop yields. In agriculture, depletion can be due to excessively intense cultivation and inadequate soil management. Soil fertility can be severely challenged when land-use changes rapidly. For example, in Colonial New England, colonists made a number of decisions that depleted the soils, including: allowing herd animals to wander freely, not replenishing soils with manure, and a sequence of events that led to erosion.Cronon, William, Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England, NY: Hill & Wang, 1983, p. 145-152. William Cronon wrote that \\"...the long-term effect was to put those soils in jeopardy. The removal of the forest, the increase in destructive floods, the soil compaction and close-cropping wrought by grazing animals, ploughing--all served to increase erosion.\\" One of the most widespread occurrences of soil depletion is in tropical zones where nutrient content of soils is low. The combined effects of growing population densities, large-scale industrial logging, slash-and-burn agriculture and ranching, and other factors, have in some places depleted soils through rapid and almost total nutrient removal. The depletion of soil has affected the state of plant life and crops in agriculture in many countries. In the middle east for example, many countries find it difficult to grow produce because of droughts, lack of soil, and lack of irrigation. The Middle East has three countries that indicate a decline in crop production, the highest rates of productivity decline are found in hilly and dryland areas. Many countries in Africa also undergo a depletion of fertile soil. In regions of dry climate like Sudan and the countries that make up the Sahara Desert, droughts and soil degradation is common. Cash crops such as teas, maize, and beans require a variety of nutrients in order to grow healthy. Soil fertility has declined in the farming regions of Africa and the use of artificial and natural fertilizers has been used to regain the nutrients of ground soil. Topsoil depletion occurs when the nutrient-rich organic topsoil, which takes hundreds to thousands of years to build up under natural conditions, is eroded or depleted of its original organic material.Bjonnes, R., 1997, Food vs Feed, People's News Agency; Frederiksberg C, Denmark Historically, many past civilizations' collapses can be attributed to the depletion of the topsoil. Since the beginning of agricultural production in the Great Plains of North America in the 1880s, about one-half of its topsoil has disappeared. Depletion may occur through a variety of other effects, including overtillage (which damages soil structure), underuse of nutrient inputs which leads to mining of the soil nutrient bank, and salinization of soil. Irrigation water effects The quality of irrigation water is very important to maintain soil fertility and tilth, and for using more soil depth by the plants.Managing Soil Tilth; Colorado state university garden notes, Retrieved on 2014-10-04. When soil is irrigated with high alkaline water, unwanted sodium salts build up in the soil which would make soil draining capacity very poor. So plant roots can not penetrate deep into the soil for optimum growth in Alkali soils. When soil is irrigated with low pH / acidic water, the useful salts ( Ca, Mg, K, P, S, etc.) are removed by draining water from the acidic soil and in addition unwanted aluminium and manganese salts to the plants are dissolved from the soil impeding plant growth.Managing irrigation water quality, Oregon State University, USA, Retrieved on 2012-10-04. When soil is irrigated with high salinity water or sufficient water is not draining out from the irrigated soil, the soil would convert into saline soil or lose its fertility. Saline water enhance the turgor pressure or osmotic pressure requirement which impedes the off take of water and nutrients by the plant roots. Top soil loss takes place in alkali soils due to erosion by rain water surface flows or drainage as they form colloids (fine mud) in contact with water. Plants absorb water-soluble inorganic salts only from the soil for their growth. Soil as such does not lose fertility just by growing crops but it lose its fertility due to accumulation of unwanted and depletion of wanted inorganic salts from the soil by improper irrigation and acid rain water (quantity and quality of water). The fertility of many soils which are not suitable for plant growth can be enhanced many times gradually by providing adequate irrigation water of suitable quality and good drainage from the soil. Global distribution Global distribution of soil types of the USDA soil taxonomy system. Mollisols, shown here in dark green, are a good (though not the only) indicator of high soil fertility. They coincide to a large extent with the world's major grain producing areas like the North American Prairie States, the Pampa and Gran Chaco of South America and the Ukraine-to-Central Asia Black Earth belt.

The concept was created by Marc Silvestri, Garth Ennis, and David Wohl in 1996. The main storyline followed Jackie Estacado, a New York Mafioso who - after turning 21 - inherited the curse of the Darkness. The character first appeared in Witchblade #10 (Nov. 1996). Top Cow announced in September 2018 that it would be relaunching The Darkness in 2019 with Matt Hawkins as writer and Tom Grindberg as artist, featuring Jackie Estacado and Sara Pezzini in supporting roles. Fictional biography =Darkness= The Darkness is a cosmic entity predating recorded history. It is the embodiment of the empty void of chaos which existed prior to the coming of God's light ‚Äì embodied as the Angelus. As the cosmos formed in its place, the now-usurped Darkness grew to resent God and His creation. Growing powerful enough to manifest itself and conjure a legion of demons, the Darkness declared war upon the Angelus and her host. This lasted for eons until a truce was found to prevent mutual destruction. To seal the covenant, the two powers mated and conceived the Witchblade. Some time after this, the Darkness began inhabiting human vessels - inherited through the sons of its chosen bloodline; the father passing the curse to his child at the moment of conception, expiring as the force leaves his body. The power then awakens on the son's 21st birthday. A wielder of the Darkness has been present in every major time period and continental power in history. These hosts have usually been of a violent predisposition, such as dictators and warlords. Many have also been of a criminal background; namely murderers, thieves, and molesters. =Jackie Estacado= Jackie Estacado was the vessel of the Darkness for the first run of the series. Raised as a hit-man for the Franchetti Family Mob, Jackie's defining quality was his penchant for murder as well as womanizing. Despite his criminal lifestyle, Jackie followed a strict code of morals. Chief among his beliefs was a trust in those who earned it and a fierce loyalty to family and allies. Early in the series, his main love interest was his childhood friend Jenny Romano. He later developed a romance with Sara Pezzini after the birth of their daughter, Hope Pezzini. The son of notorious Mob associate Danny Estacado and an unnamed prostitute, Jackie was taken in by Saint Gerald's Orphanage where he was frequently abused by the orderlies. Despite his antisocial nature even as a boy, Jackie protected his friend Jenny from their cruel treatment. At the age of six, Jackie was adopted by upcoming Mob boss Frankie \\"Kill-The-Children-Too\\" Franchetti, claiming to be his uncle. He only did so after being persuaded by Sonatine of the Brotherhood of Darkness that bringing Jackie into his inner circle would make Frankie powerful. Life in the Mob provided Jackie both with a home as well as a sense of safety and family, but also made him more violent and prone to illegal activity. Losing his virginity at age fourteen to a female officer during interrogation, he disregarded the law and developed a sex habit. Making his first hit at age sixteen, Jackie soon became Frankie's chief enforcer; skyrocketing the Franchettis into one of the top Mob families in New York City and fulfilling Sonatine's prophecy. Living a playboy lifestyle, Jackie would often visit Jenny's club to keep in touch. Both the Angelus and Sonatine kept vigil over the course of Jackie's life; both of them waiting for him to manifest the Darkness - the Brotherhood wishing to exploit his power for their own ends while the Angelus wished only to annihilate the wielder while at his most vulnerable. Jackie was also being watched by followers of the Church of the Angelus which had infiltrated various criminal operations in opposition to Franchetti's. Among them was Regis Tyne, a Mob accountant who would associate with Jackie and attempt to assassinate him over a decade later. When he turned 21, his dark powers awakened and he learned of his evil heritage. Jackie spent much of his time escaping from or fighting the Angelus, Sonatine, and the Brotherhood of the Darkness. Jackie tried to quit the mob, but Frankie kidnapped and killed Jenny, a childhood friend of Jackie's. Jackie, in a warehouse showdown with Franchetti's crew, blew up the warehouse, killing Frankie and burning Jackie alive. Jackie spent two days afterward wandering around Hell while searching for Jenny until Tom Judge came and gave him hope, a gift that allows men to exit Hell. Jackie's body was then reconstructed by the Darkness.The Darkness vol. 2, #1Universe #3 Jackie returned to find the Franchetti mob taken over by Frankie's cousin, Paulie. Paulie was able to discover Jackie's secret, and Paulie blackmailed Jackie into doing hits for him. Along the way, Jackie learned how to construct a gun out of the Darkness. Later, Jackie turns on Paulie and takes control of the Franchetti family, eventually taking on the Triads, and fighting the Russian Mafia in Atlantic City. After a confrontation with the Angelus, Jackie abandoned the Mafia life and fled to a place called Sierra Mu√±oz in hope of establishing a new empire there.Darkness vol. 3, #1 Jackie established a drug cartel in Sierra Mu√±oz with a Darkness-based narcotic made from his own bodily fluids, built an impenetrable fortress, and formed an army. The residents of Sierra Mu√±oz resisted Jackie's takeover with the help of the U.S. Department of Defense, which wanted to capture Jackie for experimentation and to learn about his armor. Jackie lost his battle with the army and was captured. Jackie learned that during a battle with the Darkness, his soul was cast into Hell, leaving his body on Earth. He made a deal with a devil who calls himself the Sovereign, who promises, in return for a number of assassinations, to reunite Jackie's body and soul.The Darkness: Accursed Vol. 2 Jackie fulfills the Sovereign's demands, including killing a demonically possessed nun, an immortal drug dealer, and surviving an encounter with a dream-stealing witch in Mexico. Eventually, while performing an assassination in Egypt, Jackie comes across a mysterious woman wearing a red ribbon who seems to lure him. He also meets a past Darkness wielder named Aram, also known as the Foreigner, who explains that the Sovereign has been manipulating Jackie from the start and that both his soul and the Darkness are still within him, merely repressed by his will and desire to be free of the Darkness's influence. Ignoring the Foreigner, Jackie follows the woman and finds himself facing against a resurrected Djinn created by a shaman specifically to kill Darkness wielders. Finding the Djinn to be virtually invincible, Jackie is guided to strangle the woman to death with her own ribbon, breaking the curse of the Djinn and freeing the woman from her eternal servitude. Jackie is confronted by Aram, who further intimidates him into finally summoning the full power of the Darkness once again. Aram disappears, leaving Jackie with the realization of the Sovereign's manipulations and fully intent on revenge with full control of his powers. Powers and abilities Jackie held the powers of the Darkness, an elemental force of chaos and creation. The core of a Darkness wielder's abilities is their accessing of an otherworldly dimension through the shadows around them and exerting control over the countless demonic creatures that dwell there. These creatures - called Darklings - usually appear as serpentine or goblinoid fiends which cause mischief and murder on behalf of their host and can communicate with their master through telepathy. They possess supernatural strength and stamina as well as deadly claws and fangs. In terms of individual prowess, Darklings are quite versatile in terms of their physique and purpose; emerging in different forms depending on the intentions or needs of their host. While they share the aforementioned traits, some Darklings have wings and others can breathe fire. Darklings have also exhibited the ability to easily adhere to sheer surfaces as well as teleporting through shadows with their bearer and even producing corrosive chemicals through their saliva or excrement. While beholden to their vessel, Darklings do exhibit their own autonomy. When in a battle, Darkness wielders envelop their whole bodies in a mystical armor of shadowy metal. This gives them strength and durability beyond that of their creatures as well as razored fingers and bladed tendrils emerging from their shoulders which can transform into wings. With time and practice, the wielder can completely alter the visage of their armor in order to shapeshift their own appearance into someone else for a time. They can also instinctively fashion weapons and shields from their armor in a similar fashion as bearers of the Witchblade. Wielders of the Darkness exhibit a potent healing factor when injured - the shadows surrounding them absorbed into their body to regenerate cells at unnatural rates, even to the extent of regrowing lost limbs and reconstructing whole portions of the body that have been destroyed. This renders the vessels effectively impervious to disease and poisons as well as resistance to supernatural afflictions such as the powers of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. This also allows them a degree of pseudo-immortality as the Darkness keeps them preserved over millennia. Any other uses of the Darkness are limited only by the imagination of the wielder. In addition to the curse, Darkness bearers are typically hardened individuals whose lives have endowed them with considerable fighting prowess and survival skills. Wielders from older time periods were usually skilled swordsmen while modern hosts like Jackie are skilled marksmen. Individual wielders might also have personal skills. Jackie was trained in chemistry by Kirchner - enabling him to convert Darkness-borne material into water, corrosives, or a narcotic. Ambitious hosts usually climb to positions of rank; overseeing armies, domains, or businesses. Significant characters Angelus :The Angelus The antithesis of the Darkness and a common enemy in the series. Jackie's first confrontation with the entity ended with him as the victor. Sonatine would later conjure the spirit in hopes of it possessing Appolonia Franchetti in their mutual desire to take vengeance on Estacado. Instead, it inhabited the body of the latter's catatonic mother, Lauren. Jackie managed to escape this encounter by creating a doppelganger of himself from the Darkness. This new Angelus would seek sanctuary in the Amazon where she would encounter then-Magdalena, Sister Mariella. :Returning some time after Frankie's death, the Angelus would again seek out Jackie - now Don of the Franchetti Mafia. At the same time, the newest Magdalena - Patience - was assigned to assassinate Jackie. During her hunt, she encountered the Angelus and followed her to Estacado. As Patience subdued Jackie, the Angelus took advantage and attacked. He was able to lure her into a tunnel to weaken her enough for Appolonia to kill her with the Spear of Destiny. The power then possessed Patience for only a few moments before being exorcised through sheer will. Appolonia Franchetti :The daughter of Frankie and Lauren Franchetti and Jackie's adoptive cousin. When she was a child, she witness her father brutally torture and murder her mother's lover. The trauma of this experience led to Appolonia's resentment of Frankie as well as her own antisocial behaviors. Growing up with Jackie, they both grew to hate each other; him for Franchetti's attention and her for her petty cruelty. Estacado was Frankie's golden boy while he more or less ignored Appolonia and her now-catatonic mother. She eventually left New York to study abroad in Europe. :Appolonia returned to the States shortly after Jackie inherited the Darkness. Bent on revenge and determined to take over the Franchetti Family without Estacado, she had Wenders kidnapped and tortured until he revealed everything he knew about Jackie, his powers, and the Angelus. Collaborating with Sonatine, she planned to become the next Angelus host. This plan misfired when the spirit inhabited her mother instead. She was left in a coma following this encounter and was only resuscitated back to consciousness by the severed blade of the Spear of Destiny. Aram :The oldest recorded host of the Darkness, Aram the Witch-King was a sovereign and warlock of Ancient Africa some ten thousand years prior to the Common Era. Willingly letting the curse into his body, he used its power to take entire regions of land to sate his lust for conquest. At some point after becoming disgusted with his cruelty, he used his mastery of sorcery to exorcise the Darkness from his body. Although effectively free from the curse, the Darkness condemned him with immortality; promising that he would wander the Earth until he let it back in. :Over the centuries, Aram - known by then only as the Foreigner - would travel the globe watching over Darkness hosts from a distance. At some point in the course of his trek, he would encounter and slay a djinn created to kill Darkness bearers and would also outwit the Sovereign. Capris Castiglione :Jackie's twin sister and a minor ally in the first volume of the series and later a primary antagonist in or around the last volume. Separated from her sibling at birth, Capris inherited only a small portion of the Darkness's power - being one of the only women to bear the curse. Raised by Father Brendan, Capris lived an idyllic life. This all ended after her 18th birthday when she found her longtime friend and college roommate - Blaire Dray - dead from an apparent suicide. It's soon found out that Blaire was murdered as cover for an illegal porn racket. :Capris made her last appearance in the Outer Darkness storyline, where it was revealed that she had become fully seduced by the euphoric power of the Darkness and had been training and perfecting her powers. The Darkness chose her to be his new host and used her to try to kill Jackie. She attacked and overpowered him with her superior powers and would have killed him if not for Aram using his last bit of magic to shut down the Darkness. Jackie killed Capris using a magical crystal glove given to him by Aram. She is last seen as a damned soul in a strange afterlife for Darkness-wielders. :While she did manifest Darkness powers upon turning 21, Capris's abilities were significantly less than those of her brother when she first appeared in the series. She seemed to function as a repository of power which Jackie drew on during their encounter with the Cherub Hostile. She initially only showcased increased strength and resilience as well as the ability to conjure tendrils from the surrounding shadows. Over a decade later, her powers expanded exponentially to the point of manifesting her own armor and creating zombies by feeding them her blood. Sonatine :The leader of the Brotherhood of Darkness and a recurring antagonist early in the series. Having followed Jackie's bloodline since the days of their founder - Miguel Estacado - Sonatine was obsessed with remaking the world in the image he desired using the powers of the Darkness. Sonatine first met Jackie after he manifested the curse. While initially presenting himself as a mentor, Jackie's refusal led to the Brotherhood kidnapping Jenny to force his cooperation. However, this plan backfired when the Angelus arrived and they were forced to work together. :Sonatine's knowledge of the occult allowed him a degree of arcane ability and a prolonged lifespan. He carried a star talisman that compelled people to believe anything he said or to answer any question truthfully. It could also create light powerful enough to frighten Darklings. He was also schooled in ceremonial magic and possession. These were showcased when he ritualistically conjured the presence of the Angelus in an attempt to enslave its power, and later after being gravely wounded he transferred his consciousness into one of his servants, Wenders. Sovereign :The Sovereign was the Emperor of Rome roughly three thousand years prior to the Common Era. His reign was short- lived as he and his family were murdered by a bearer of the Darkness. Sentenced to Hell for his cruelties in life, he managed to deceive an angel into freeing his soul. Bargaining with the Fates to be spared an eternity of torture, he became a custodian of souls sent to Hell. Able to enter the living world only by possessing statues made in his image, the Sovereign became obsessed with taking revenge of any vessel of the Darkness he encountered.

The Magdalena :Descended from Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ, The Magdalena is an assassin born and bred to serve the Vatican in times of duress.

He later becomes romantically obsessed with Jackie, who regards Wenders as cowardly and untrustworthy. Angelus Warriors : Servants of the Angeleous. Elle :An artificial human who becomes Jackie's companion. The Foreigner/Aman The Witch-King :An ancient wielder of the Darkness that was able to get rid of it through meditation and years of internal struggle. Paulie Franchetti :The cousin of Frankie Franchetti and the Don of the Franchetti crime family after Jackie kills his cousin.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is the most populous among the cities and municipalities in the province of Surigao del Sur. Barangay Mangagoy, the downtown area often dubbed by its residents as \\"the little city within the city\\", is the center of trade and industry of Bislig which has a population of 32,464 as of the 2015 estimate. It is the largest barangay in the city and the entire province of Surigao del Sur in terms of population. Since Barangay Poblacion is often referred by the locals simply as 'Bislig', Mangagoy on the other hand is often mistaken as a separate town though it is only just one out of the 24 barangays that comprises the entire City of Bislig. In 2000, Bislig was converted into a city per Republic Act 8804.NSCB ‚Äì 2001 Factsheet ‚Äì 12 New Cities Created , July‚ÄìDecember 2000. It is the easternmost city in the Philippines in terms of geographical location. Etymology The legendary allusions as to how Bislig got its name could be traced back to the era prior to the coming of the Spanish conquistadors. The town got its name from a forest vine of the rattan family that grew in abundance along the banks of its rivers. This vine was noted for its strength and became known for saving a royal couple who crossed the swollen river in one of their hunting expeditions and who almost died as they were carried downstream by the rushing current. The legend has it that these hunters had already lost hope of surviving until they were able to cling to a vine which was about 1/4 inch in diameter called Bislig. As a sign of thanksgiving, the ruler named this place Bislig. Historically, Bislig derived its name from the word \\"bizlin\\", a kind of gold, \\"which is worth two pesos a tael. The weight of a tael is one and one-eight ounces\\" in the 16th century, which the natives used for trade and barter. Prior to the coming of Spaniards, this terminology was understood in Luzon and in Mindanao. In the report of the Administrator of Royal Properties Andres Mirandaola dated 8 September 1573 sent to King Philip of Spain that \\"much gold found in the island of Mindanao, District of Butuan, Surigao ...\\" It is believed that this kind of gold found in the rolling hills and mountains of the southernmost portion of Bislig and Agusan Province. However, historical records shows that the name has been variously spelled by the Spanish chroniclers. Conquistador Miguel de Loarca, in his extreme exploratory survey trip of the archipelago, first mentioned and spelled it \\"Beslin\\" in his historical accounts \\"Relacion de los Yslas Filipinas\\" in 1582, as well as in the Confirmaciones de Encomienda (1616‚Äì1700) which Bislig was under the encomienda of Alferez Juan delas Marianas in 1619. In the \\"Historia general de los religiosos descalzos del orden de San Agustin\\" of Fray Andres de San Nicolas in 1664 spelled it \\"Bislin\\" and also in the \\"Historia general... del Orden de San Agustin\\" of Fray Luis de Jesus in 1681. A Franciscan writer, Fray Juan de San Francisco de San Antonio spelled it \\"Baslig\\" in his \\"Cronicas\\" in 1738. Other Spanish chroniclers spelled it \\"Bislic\\" and \\"Bisliq\\". In the first detailed map of the Philippines in 1749, published in \\"Historia de la Provincia de Filipinas\\" by a Jesuit, Father Pedro Murillo Velarde spelled it Bislig, as did in the \\"Historia General ...\\" of Fray Pedro San Francisco de Assis in 1768 and in the \\"Mapa dela Provincia de Caraga\\" by Francisco Alegre in 1751. A complete statistical data of District of Caraga compiled in 1750 spelled as \\"Bislig\\", and also in the document titled \\"Provincia de San Nicolas de Tolentino de Agustinos descalzos dela Congregacion de Espa√±a y Indias\\" in 1879. From the time on, it is known and spelled as Bislig. Geography Bislig is approximately northeast of Davao City, south of Tandag City (the provincial capital), south of Hinatuan, and southeast of Butuan City. Bislig has a land area of 40,503 hectares spread over 24 barangays, with close to half which are tropical rainforest is classified as \\"public forest\\". =Climate= Type II Climate characterized by no dry season and with a very pronounced maximum rainfall from November to January. The city enjoys steady weather condition being outside the typhoon belt. =Barangays= Bislig City is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. History Andres Soriano Avenue The first inhabitants of Bislig were believed to have come from the Agusan Valley in the hinterlands of Mindanao beyond the Magdiwata Mountains. These people used spears, bows and arrows and lived a semi-nomadic life and were called Manobos. They were ruled during the later part of the seventeenth century by a native leader called \\"Bagani\\", meaning a formidable leader. They were very brave, tough and war-like. They also introduced edible crops such as rice, corn and rootcrops to the area. At the turn of the century, Spanish Colonizers and Missionaries imposed the rule of Spain and brought with them Tagalogs, Ilonggos, and Cebuanos from the North as members of their expeditionary forces. Long before, it became a town on 1 January 1921 per Executive Order No. 62 issued by Governor General Francis Burton Harrison on 28 December 1920 with Primitivo A. Castillo as its first Municipal President, Vice-President: Sulpicio P. Laurente & Councilors: Ciriaco Alba; Bartolome Alvar; Higino Basa√±ez; Escolastico Carmen; Tomas Masancay; Basilio Dua; and Macario Tenchavez. Bislig was already an established political instrumentality or \\"pueblo\\" in the Province of Surigao (now Surigao del Sur and Surigao del Norte). Earlier, the province was a part of an even bigger territory stretching from Northeastern Mindanao down to the island's Southeastern \\"pueblo\\" of Caraga and Man-ay in Davao Oriental. Caraga was originally the seat of political, military and religious authority.Friends of Bislig History Book Since then efforts were made to improve and develop Bislig until the advent of Citihood campaign in 1999 and by virtue of Republic Act No. 8804 Bislig was converted into a component city duly ratified and approved in a plebiscite conducted on 18 September 2000.

In 1915, Quelle hired bookbinder John Borsdamm, who would later draw fellow craftspeople to the press, including master printer and eventual manager Will A. Friend. In 1917, the university bought the printing works, making it a division of Stanford. 333x333px In 1925, SUP hired William Hawley Davis, Professor of English, to be the inaugural general editor at the press. In the following year, SUP issued its first catalog, listing seventy-five published books. University President Ray Lyman Wilbur established a Special Committee in 1927 comprising the editor, the press manager, the sales manager, and the comptroller in service of the press, whose \\"principal object is to serve in the publication of University publications of all sorts and to promote human welfare generally.‚Äù 400px The first press director, Donald P. Bean, was appointed in 1945. By the 1950s, the printing plant ranked seventh nationally among university presses with respect to title output. The head book designer in the late 1950s and 1960s was printer and typographer Jack Stauffacher, later an AIGA medalist. In 1999, the press became a division of the Stanford University Libraries. It moved from its previous location adjacent to the Stanford campus to its current location, in Redwood City, in 2012-13. Stanford Business Books, an imprint for professional titles in business, launched in 2000, with two publications about Silicon Valley. The press launched the Briefs imprint in 2012, featuring short-form publications across its entire list. With funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, SUP debuted a publishing program for born-digital interactive scholarly works in 2015. That same year, it launched its trade imprint, Redwood Press, with a novel by Bahiyyah Nakhjavani. In April 2019, the provost of Stanford University announced announced plans to cease providing funds for the press, drawing widespread criticism. Following protests from Stanford faculty and students, as well as the wider academic and publishing community, the subsidy for the 2019-20 academic year was reinstated, with additional options for future fundraising on the press's part to be discussed.  Imprints  = Redwood Press = Redwood Press publishes books written for a trade audience, spanning a variety of topics, by both academics and non- academic writers. = Stanford Briefs = Stanford Briefs are essay-length works published across SUP's various disciplines. = Stanford Business Books = The Stanford Business Books imprint is home to academic trade books, professional titles, texts for course use, and monographs that explore the social science side of business.

It is the primary process by which silicon integrated circuit chips are built. The process utilizes the surface passivation and thermal oxidation methods. The planar process was developed at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959. Overview The key concept is to view a circuit in its two-dimensional projection (a plane), thus allowing the use of photographic processing concepts such as film negatives to mask the projection of light exposed chemicals. This allows the use of a series of exposures on a substrate (silicon) to create silicon oxide (insulators) or doped regions (conductors). Together with the use of metallization, and the concepts of p‚Äìn junction isolation and surface passivation, it is possible to create circuits on a single silicon crystal slice (a wafer) from a monocrystalline silicon boule. The process involves the basic procedures of silicon dioxide (SiO2) oxidation, SiO2 etching and heat diffusion. The final steps involves oxidizing the entire wafer with an SiO2 layer, etching contact vias to the transistors, and depositing a covering metal layer over the oxide, thus connecting the transistors without manually wiring them together. History =Background= In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick at Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) accidentally discovered that silicon dioxide could be grown on silicon. Later in 1958, they proposed that silicon oxide layers could protect silicon surfaces during diffusion processes, and could be used for diffusion masking. Surface passivation, the process by which a semiconductor surface is rendered inert, and does not change semiconductor properties as a result of interaction with air or other materials in contact with the surface or edge of the crystal, was first developed by Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla at BTL in the late 1950s. He discovered that the formation of a thermally grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer greatly reduced the concentration of electronic states at the silicon surface, and discovered the important quality of SiO2 films to preserve the electrical characteristics of p‚Äìn junctions and prevent these electrical characteristics from deteriorating by the gaseous ambient environment. He found that silicon oxide layers could be used to electrically stabilize silicon surfaces. He developed the surface passivation process, a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below. By growing a layer of silicon dioxide on top of a silicon wafer, Atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer. Atalla first published his findings in 1957. According to Fairchild Semiconductor engineer Chih-Tang Sah, the surface passivation process developed by Atalla and his team was \\"the most important and significant technology advance, which blazed the trail\\" that led to the silicon integrated circuit. =Development= At a 1958 Electrochemical Society meeting, Mohamed Atalla presented a paper about the surface passivation of PN junctions by thermal oxidation, based on his 1957 BTL memos, and demonstrated silicon dioxide's passivating effect on a silicon surface. This was the first demonstration to show that high-quality silicon dioxide insulator films could be grown thermally on the silicon surface to protect the underlying silicon p-n junction diodes and transistors. Swiss engineer Jean Hoerni attended the same 1958 meeting, and was intrigued by Atalla's presentation. Hoerni came up with the \\"planar idea\\" one morning while thinking about Atalla's device. Taking advantage of silicon dioxide's passivating effect on the silicon surface, Hoerni proposed to make transistors that were protected by a layer of silicon dioxide. This led to the first successful product implementation of the Atalla silicon transistor passivation technique by thermal oxide. The planar process was developed by Jean Hoerni, one of the \\"traitorous eight\\", while working at Fairchild Semiconductor, with a first patent issued 1959. Together with the use of metallization (to join together the integrated circuits), and the concept of p‚Äìn junction isolation (from Kurt Lehovec), the researchers at Fairchild were able to create circuits on a single silicon crystal slice (a wafer) from a monocrystalline silicon boule. In 1959, Robert Noyce built on Hoerni's work with his conception of an integrated circuit (IC), which added a layer of metal to the top of Hoerni's basic structure to connect different components, such as transistors, capacitors, or resistors, located on the same piece of silicon. The planar process provided a powerful way of implementing an integrated circuit that was superior to earlier conceptions of the integrated circuit. Noyce's invention was the first monolithic IC chip. Early versions of the planar process used a photolithography process using near-ultraviolet light from a mercury vapor lamp. As of 2011, small features are typically made with 193 nm \\"deep\\" UV lithography. Shannon Hill. \\"UV Lithography: Taking Extreme Measures\\".

In the 1950s the company was best known for making large custom vehicles such as bookmobiles, canteens and mobile television units. History The company started in 1860 as a carriage factory known as the Wehe Company in Marshallville, Ohio. In 1882 blacksmith George Gerstenslager went to work for the company, and by 1904 was the owner and eponym. In 1907, the company moved to Wooster, Ohio. In the early 1920s, Gerstenslager changed from production of buggies, surreys and wagons to van bodies and special truck bodies. After World War II, Gerstenslager began producing custom-built mobile units such as Bookmobiles, fire rescue vehicles, dental units, canteens, mobile X-ray units, mobile hospitals, as well as mobile television units used by the major networks. The company also built vehicles for the United States Postal Service. In the early 1950s, Gerstenslager designed five Wienermobiles for the Oscar Mayer hot dog producer. In the 1960s, the company expanded to make parts for the automotive, truck and agricultural industries. After expanding their sheet metal stamping capabilities in support of the custom truck division, the stamping division continued to grow through partnerships with most major automotive manufacturers to make aftermarket parts. In later years the stamping division became the larger part of the company and the custom truck division was shut down in 1986 so the company could focus all resources to the stamping division. In 1997, Gerstenslager was acquired by Worthington Industries of Columbus, Ohio. In 2011, Worthington merged Gerstenslager into International Tooling Solutions to form ArtiFlex Manufacturing; Worthington remains a part- owner of ArtiFlex.

The line interchanges with the Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad at Cottondale, Florida, and with the CSX Dothan Subdivision near Dothan, Alabama. It also interchanges with the Chattahoochee Bay Railroad in Dothan. A wide variety of commodities is carried, including aggregates, brick, cement, chemicals, coal, food and feed products, forest products, metallic ores and minerals, steel, and scrap. History The company's main line between Panama City and Dothan was constructed in 1906‚Äì1908 by the Atlanta and St. Andrews Bay Railroad (ASAB). The Abbeville branch was constructed in 1887‚Äì1893 by the Alabama Midland Railway and came under the control of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. CSX Transportation, eventual successor to the ACL, sold the line to the Abbeville‚ÄìGrimes Railway Company (AG) in 1989. This company was merged with the Bay Line Railroad on June 26, 1996. The Stone Container Corporation had owned the ASAB since 1987. Effective January 1, 1994, it sold the assets of the railroad to Rail Management Corporation, which created the new Bay Line Railroad company to operate it. Genesee & Wyoming acquired all the assets of Rail Management on June 1, 2005, including the Bay Line Railroad.

Large labels are continents that joined during these orogenies. Present day coastlines in gray. Sutures are red. The Alleghanian orogeny or Appalachian orogeny is one of the geological mountain-forming events that formed the Appalachian Mountains and Allegheny Mountains. The term and spelling Alleghany orogeny was originally proposed by H.P. Woodward in 1957. The Alleghanian orogeny occurred approximately 325 million to 260 million years ago over at least five deformation events Bartholomew, M.J., and Whitaker, A.E., 2010, The Alleghanian deformational sequence at the foreland junction of the Central and Southern Appalachians in Tollo, R.P., Bartholomew, M.J., Hibbard, J.P., and Karabinos, P.M., eds., From Rodinia to Pangea: The Lithotectonic Record of the Appalachian Region, GSA Memoir 206, p. 431-454. in the Carboniferous to Permian period. The orogeny was caused by Africa colliding with North America. At the time, these continents did not exist in their current forms: North America was part of the Euramerica super- continent, while Africa was part of Gondwana. This collision formed the super- continent Pangaea, which contained all major continental land masses. The collision provoked the orogeny: it exerted massive stress on what is today the Eastern Seaboard of North America, forming a wide and high mountain chain. Evidence for the Alleghanian orogeny stretches for many hundreds of miles on the surface from Alabama to New Jersey and can be traced further subsurface to the southwest. In the north, the Alleghanian deformation extends northeast to Newfoundland. Subsequent erosion wore down the mountain chain and spread sediments both to the east and to the west. Continental collision The Alleghanian orogeny, a result of three separate continental collisions. USGS The immense region involved in the continental collision, the vast temporal length of the orogeny and the thickness of the pile of sediments and igneous rocks known to have been involved are evidence that at the peak of the mountain-building process, the Appalachians likely once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before they were eroded. As the continents collided, the rock material trapped in-between was crushed and forced upward. With nowhere to go, rocks along the eastern margin of the North American continent were shoved far inland (the same occurred in the opposite direction along the margin of the African continent, forming the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and the western Sahara). Close to the boundary between the colliding plates, tectonic stresses contributed to the metamorphism of the rock (i.e. the transformation of igneous and sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock). The sedimentary rock in the eastern Appalachian Basin region was squeezed into great folds that ran perpendicular to the direction of forces. The greatest amount of deformation associated with the Alleghanian orogeny occurred in the Southern Appalachians (North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia). In that region, a series of great faults developed in addition to the folds. As the two continents collided, large belts of rock bounded by thrust faults piled one on top of another, shortening the crust along the eastern edge of North America in the North Carolina and Tennessee region by as much as . The relative amount of deformation gradually diminishes as one travels northward. The fold belt extends northward through Pennsylvania and gradually fades in the vicinity of the New York border. The Kittatinny Mountains in northwestern New Jersey mark the northeasternmost extension of the high ridges of the Valley and Ridge Province. The influence of Alleghanian deformation on the regions east of the Valley and Ridge Province must have been even more intense; however, there is little evidence preserved. Rocks of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian age are missing along the Eastern Seaboard. Subsequent erosion Major fault at the dividing line between the Allegheny Plateau and the true Appalachian Mountains (Williamsport, Pennsylvania). The mountains formed by the Alleghanian orogeny were once rugged and high, but in our time are now eroded into only a small remnant: the heavily eroded hills of the Piedmont. Sediments that were carried eastward formed the coastal plain and part of the continental shelf. Thus, the coastal plain and Piedmont are largely the byproducts of erosion that took place from 150+ million years ago to the present. Sediments that were carried westward formed the Allegheny and Cumberland Plateau, which in some areas are popularly called mountains, but are actually simply uplifted and eroded plateaus. A portion of the Alleghanian mountain system departed with Africa when Pangaea broke up and the Atlantic Ocean began to form. Today, this forms the Anti-Atlas mountains of Morocco. The Anti-Atlas have been geologically uplifted in relatively recent times, and are today much more rugged than their Alleghanian relatives.

Biography Yisrael Meir Lau (8 years old) in the arms of Elazar Schiff, Buchenwald survivors at their arrival at Haifa on 15 July 1945 =Early life and World War II= Lau was born on 1 June 1937, in the Polish town of Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. His father, Rabbi Moshe Chaim Lau (), the last Chief Rabbi of the town, was murdered in the Treblinka extermination camp.

Mishpacha Special Supplement: A Father to Follow: Fathers, sons, and their intertwining paths. Pesach 5771 (April 2011), pp. 8‚Äì17. As a seven-year-old, after traumatic separation from his mother Chaya, Lau was imprisoned in a Nazi slave labor camp and then in Buchenwald concentration camp. He has attributed his unlikely survival to heroic efforts of his older brother Naphtali Lau-Lavie who concealed him, at constant risk, and enlisted other prisoners in this effort. In 1945, Yisrael Meir was freed from the Buchenwald concentration camp. He became a poster child for miraculous survival, and the inhumanity of the Nazi regime, after U.S. Army chaplain Rabbi Herschel Schacter detected him hiding behind a heap of corpses when the camp was liberated.Out of the Depths: A Memoir by Chief Rabbi Israel Meir LauMargalit Fox 'Rabbi Who Cried to the Jews of Buchenwald: ‚ÄòYou Are Free‚Äô, at The New York Times, 27 March 2013. Lau has credited a teen prisoner with protecting him in the camp (later determined by historian Kenneth Waltzer to be Fedor Mikhailichenko).Associated Press (26 June 2008). Academics make startling finds as they sweep through untapped Nazi records. His entire family was murdered, with the exception of his older brother, Naphtali Lau-Lavie, his half brother, Yehoshua Lau-Hager, and his uncle already living in Mandatory Palestine. =Aliyah and studies= Lau immigrated to Mandatory Palestine with his brother Naphtali in July 1945, where he was raised by an aunt and uncle, andOut of the Depths, Memoir, Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau> studied in the famous yeshiva Kol Torah under Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach as well as in Ponevezh and Knesses Chizkiyahu. He was ordained as a rabbi in 1961. =Rabbinical career= He served as Chief Rabbi in Netanya (1978‚Äì1988), and at that time developed his reputation as a popular orator. =Family= Lau married Chaya Ita Frankel, a daughter of Rabbi Yitzchok Yedidya Frankel, the Rabbi of South Tel Aviv. Lau is the father of three sons and five daughters. His eldest son, Moshe Chaim, took his place as Rabbi in Netanya in 1989; his son David became the Chief Rabbi of Modi'in, and later Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel; and his youngest, Tzvi Yehuda, is the Rabbi of North Tel Aviv. Lau is the uncle of Rabbi Binyamin (Benny) Lau, an educator and activist in the Religious Zionist movement, and Amichai Lau- Lavie, the founder and artistic director of the Jewish ritual theater company Storahtelling. =Chairman of Yad Vashem= In 2008, Lau was appointed Chairman of Yad Vashem, succeeding Tommy Lapid. Rabbinical career Rabbi Lau addresses the United Nations Lau was ordained as a rabbi in 1961. His first rabbinic position was at the Ohr Torah synagogue in North Tel Aviv. In 1965 he was appointed as rabbi of the Tiferet Tzvi Synagogue in Tel Aviv, a position he held until 1971 when he was appointed rabbi of North Tel Aviv. In 1978 Lau was appointed as chief rabbi of the city of Netanya. In 1983 Lau was appointed to serve on the Mo'etzet of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate. In 1988, after the death of his father-in-law, Lau was appointed to serve as chief rabbi of Tel Aviv, a position he held until 1993. When Lau met the Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson in 1992, the Rebbe told Lau to finish his work in Tel Aviv, as he would soon be chosen to become the Chief Rabbi of Israel.Israel Meir Lau, Out of the Depths. Sterling, 2011. Page 194 In 1993, Lau was elected Chief Rabbi of Israel. He served as Chief Rabbi till 2003. On 9 June 2005, Lau was reinstalled as Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv returning to the post he served from 1985 until 1993. Lau has often been characterized as the \\"consensus rabbi\\", and has close ties to both Haredi and Modern Orthodox Judaism, particularly in regard to his politics, which have been characterized as moderate Zionist.Only cache available Israel Prize for 'consensus rabbi' Yisrael Lau, Jerusalem Post, 14 April 2005 One report described him as \\"too Zionist to be considered Haredi.\\" He is one of the few figures in the Haredi world who has managed to gain the trust and admiration of both the Sephardic and Ashkenazic population. Lau has received some negative attention for his stances and remarks on non- Orthodox denominations of Judaism. When Lau was awarded the Israel Prize in May 2005, there were protests from the Masorti and Reform movements in Israel. Non-Orthodox leaders noted that it was ironic that Lau was being honored for \\"bridging rifts in Israeli society\\". Lau's spokespeople said that the fact that he had been approved by the (presumably heterogeneous) Prize Committee spoke for itself. Interfaith work In 1993, Rav Lau had an hour-long meeting with John Paul II at the Pope's summer residence of Castel Gandolfo near Rome sought to offer the Vatican's moral support to the latest peace moves in the Middle East. The visit was the first between a Pope and one of Israel's chief rabbis since the founding of the Jewish state in 1948. In 2009, he was critical of a speech given by Pope Benedict XVI during a visit to Israel. He later applauded a new papal statement which gave more emphasis to the suffering of Jews during the Holocaust. Presidential candidacy In the spring of 2006, the Israeli media reported that Lau was being considered for presidency of the State of Israel. Some critics in the Israeli media wrote that Lau was more focused on maintaining his image as a progressive than in implementing such positions in the rabbinate's policies, specifically major issues such as agunot, civil marriage, the status of Shabbat, and other divisive topics that continue to be relevant to many in the secular community vis-a-vis the Chief Rabbinate, which under Lau's leadership usually sided with the Orthodox perspective. Awards and recognition In 2005, Lau was awarded the Israel Prize for his lifetime achievements and special contribution to society and the State of Israel. On 14 April 2011, he was awarded the Legion of Honor (France's highest accolade) by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in recognition of his efforts to promote interfaith dialogue. Views \\"Let's sit down together and let's live together. We always knew how to die together. The time has come for us to know also how to live together, said Lau, calling for co-operation and dialogue between all Jews (Jerusalem, 14 February 1999). At the 2006 commemoration of the massacre of Babi Yar, Lau pointed out that if the world had reacted, perhaps the Holocaust might never have happened. Implying that Hitler was emboldened by this impunity, Lau speculated: > Maybe, say, this Babi Yar was also a test for Hitler.

The Harbor Springs Railway was a narrow gauge railway built at Harbor Springs, Michigan on Little Traverse Bay on Lake Michigan. It was nicknamed the Hemlock Central because of the great numbers of hemlock trees growing in the area. The railway was chartered by Ephraim Shay, the inventor of the Shay locomotive, on February 2, 1902, but may have started construction as early as December 10, 1900. It was primarily a lumber-hauling operation, although summer vacationing tourists were carried for a fare of 25¬¢. It originally operated a route of to Stutsman and Race Mill; it was extended a further mile in 1904 to Carter's Mill. Small temporary branches were also constructed as well as the moving of the right of way when logging operations moved, as was typical for a logging railroad. The line was laid with very light rail of and worked by three locomotives built by the railroad to the design of its President and General Manager, Ephraim Shay. They were geared locomotives of the typical Shay pattern, but were unusual in that they had no frames, the boiler being the main structural component. The line was built and funded without debt (thanks to Shay's royalties and licenses from his locomotive designs) and by 1906, the investment in physical plant was estimated at $51,346 (equivalent to $ in ). The line ceased operations in 1910 and was dismantled in 1912. The company dissolved on January 17, 1912.

The chain emphasizes fresh ingredients, each restaurant featuring a self-serve salsa bar. At the time of its acquisition by MTY in 2016, the chain operated 162 restaurants in the United States, Dubai, and Singapore, most of which are franchised. History =1990s= In 1990 Jim and Linda Magglos took out a third mortgage on their home and opened the first Baja Fresh in Newbury Park, California in the Conejo Valley. Franchising began in 1995, and the chain had expanded to 31 outlets by 1997. In 1998, the Magglos worked with Greg Dollarhyde and Pete Siracusa, who recapitalized the parent company, acquired venture capital and bought shares from outside holders to take control of Baja Fresh. Dollarhyde became CEO with Siracusa as Chairman and Magglos as President, they then grew the chain from 45 locations in 1998 to 249 stores. =2000s= In 2002, Wendy's International purchased Baja Fresh for $275 million. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Wendy's, the 249 restaurant chain saw consistently declining same-store sales. In 2006, Wendy's sold the roughly 300-location Baja Fresh chain for $31 million to BF Acquisition Holdings, a private investor consortium that had operated franchised restaurant units for such chains as Sweet Factory, Cinnabon and Denny's. At the time of the firm's acquisition by BF Acquisition Holdings in 2006, Baja Fresh had 144 company-owned and 154 franchised locations in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington as well as the District of Columbia. The consortium was led by David Kim, who took on the role of CEO, and later appeared on Season 2 episode 20 of the reality TV series Undercover Boss. In 2009, Baja Fresh moved its corporate headquarters from Thousand Oaks to Cypress, California, and closed all locations in central Ohio. =2010s= Between 2009 and 2010, the chain closed stores in Berkeley, Pasadena and Torrance, California. When the chain opened its first international location in Dubai in 2010, the chain also had 255 restaurants in 28 U.S. states. In late 2011, the company moved its main corporate office from Cypress to Irvine. In early 2012, the chain closed its store in Newbury Park, California although this was a different location in Newbury Park than the original site of the first Baja Fresh. On April 12, 2013 Baja Fresh closed all 5 locations in Phoenix, Arizona without notice. On April 5, 2012, David Kim stepped down from his position as company CEO. His position was assumed by company president Chuck Rink, who began to hold both titles. Five Phoenix-area locations were closed by a franchise operator in 2013. In September 2016, it was announced that Baja Fresh's parent, BF Acquisition Holdings, was sold to MTY Food Group for $27 million. At the time of the acquisition by MTY, Baja Fresh had 162 restaurants and its sister company La Salsa had 23 restaurant with 16 of the combined 185 locations were franchised. It is unclear if the new owner would combined the two chains or keep them separate. In an earlier press release announcing MTY's acquisition of Kahala Brands just two months previously, MTY gave the vague statement that \\"Kahala will stay in Kahala's current headquarters... while MTY's US operations will move into Kahala's offices\\". This statement could imply that Baja Fresh might become a subsidiary of Kahala instead of just sharing space with Kahala and reporting directly to MTY corporate headquarters in Canada. Published newspaper reports are not very clear about the exact relationship between Kahala and MTY units in the United States. International expansion The first location outside of the United States was open inside the Dubai Mall in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in 2010 by franchise owner Vetra Investments. By the end of 2011, two additional locations were opened in Dubai at the Mall of the Emirates and Deira City Centre plus another location in Sharjah by the same franchisee. A fifth UAE location was opened at Mirdiff City Centre in Dubai in 2014. By the end of 2015, the lone location in Sharjah and the locations at the Dubai Mall and the Deira City Centre in Dubai were closed and replaced by new location in the Yas Mall in Dubai. In August 2016, Vetra opened a food truck in Dubai. The first location in East Asia opened in Singapore in 2012 by franchisee Gloria Foods Pte. Ltd. A second location in Singapore was opened in 2015. La Salsa La Salsa has been a subsidiary of Baja Fresh since 2007 when La Salsa was acquired from CKE Restaurants. Similar to Baja Fresh, La Salsa is a chain of fast-casual Tex Mex restaurants that has locations throughout the United States with most of the restaurants located in Southern California.

Riluzole delays the onset of ventilator-dependence or tracheostomy in some people and may increase survival by two to three months. Riluzole is available in tablet and liquid form. Medical use = Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis = Riluzole was approved in the United States for the treatment of ALS by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1995. A Cochrane Library review states a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year. Adverse effects * Very common (>10% frequency): nausea; weakness; decreased lung function * Common (1‚Äì10% frequency): headache; dizziness; drowsiness; vomiting; abdominal pain; increased aminotransferases * Uncommon (0.1-1% frequency): pancreatitis; interstitial lung disease * Rare (<0.1% frequency): neutropenia; allergic reaction (including angiooedema, anaphylactoid reaction) =Overdose= Symptoms of overdose include: neurological and psychiatric symptoms, acute toxic encephalopathy with stupor, coma and methemoglobinemia. Severe methemoglobinemia may be rapidly reversible after treatment with methylene blue. Contraindications Contraindications for riluzole include: known prior hypersensitivity to riluzole or any of the excipients inside the preparations, liver disease, pregnancy or lactation. =Interactions= CYP1A2 substrates, inhibitors and inducers would probably interact with riluzole, due its dependency on this cytochrome for metabolism. Mechanism of action Riluzole preferentially blocks TTX-sensitive sodium channels, which are associated with damaged neurons. Riluzole has also been reported to directly inhibit the kainate and NMDA receptors. The drug has also been shown to postsynaptically potentiate GABAA receptors via an allosteric binding site. However, the action of riluzole on glutamate receptors has been controversial, as no binding of the drug to any known sites has been shown for them. In addition, as its antiglutamatergic action is still detectable in the presence of sodium channel blockers, it is also uncertain whether or not it acts via this way. Rather, its ability to stimulate glutamate uptake seems to mediate many of its effects. In addition to its role in accelerating glutamate clearance from the synapse, riluzole may also prevent glutamate release from presynaptic terminals. Since CK1Œ¥ plays a key role in TDP-43 proteinopathy, a pathological hallmark of ALS, this could help to better decipher drug mechanism of action. Synthesis Riluzole can be prepared beginning with the reaction of 4-(trifluoromethoxy)aniline with potassium thiocyanate followed by reaction with bromine, forming the thiazole ring.L. M.

The Irma opened with a party on November 18, 1902, to which Cody invited the press and dignitaries from as far away as Boston. The hotel quickly became the social center of Cody. In the meantime, Buffalo Bill was under pressure from creditors and was forced to sign over the hotel to his wife Louisa in 1913, who was at that time on bad terms with him. After Cody's death in 1917 the hotel was foreclosed upon and sold to Barney Link. Before the end of the year Link's estate sold the property back to Louisa, who kept it until she died in 1925. The new owners, Henry and Pearl Newell, gradually expanded the hotel, building an annex around 1930 on the west side to accommodate automobile-borne visitors. After her husband's death in 1940, Pearl Newell operated the hotel until her own death in 1965.

He spent most of his career at Leeds United, from 1962 to 1978. Internationally, Reaney was a regular squad member for the England national football team, making his debut in 1968, and making three international appearances in total. However, he missed out on two FIFA World Cup squads ‚Äì for the 1966 edition, he was put on standby, and for the 1970 edition, he suffered a season-ending injury. Career =Leeds United= He moved to the West Riding of Yorkshire from London as a child and left school at 15. He was briefly a car mechanic before Don Revie signed him for Leeds as an apprentice. Reaney made his professional debut shortly before his 18th birthday, and went on to make 35 League appearances in his first season, and was part of the team which won the Second Division in 1964. In the 1964‚Äì65 season, Reaney missed just one League game, and scored the first of his League goals as Leeds challenged for both the League championship and FA Cup; however, Leeds lost out on both trophies, with Manchester United winning the title, whilst Liverpool won the FA Cup. Reaney quickly earned a reputation as a fiercely competitive, disciplined defender, capable of closing out the most talented of attackers ‚Äì George Best rated Reaney as one of the two best defenders he played against. In 1967‚Äì68 Leeds won the League Cup and the Fairs Cup, and in 1968‚Äì69 they won the League championship. Leeds progressed in 1969‚Äì70 towards a \\"treble\\" of League championship, FA Cup and European Cup, but a broken leg suffered in a game against West Ham United meant that he missed the run-in to the end of the season ‚Äì a factor that contributed to Leeds missing out on all three trophies. In addition, the broken leg meant that Reaney missed the summer's World Cup in Mexico. He eventually returned in the 1970‚Äì71 season to make 18 League appearances and be part of the team which won its second Fairs Cup, but which missed out on the League championship again. In the 1971‚Äì72 season he was part of the team that won the FA Cup, but which missed out the League Championship yet again. The following season saw more disappointment for Reaney as Leeds lost the FA Cup final to Sunderland and a controversial European Cup Winners Cup final to A.C. Milan. Reaney's career at Leeds passed 500 appearances in 1973‚Äì74 as Leeds embarked on a 29-match unbeaten start to the season to earn the League title for the second time under Revie, who then left to take over the England job. Reaney was in the team which duly progressed to the European Cup final the following season in 1974‚Äì75 but was controversially defeated 2‚Äì0 by Bayern Munich. =Later career= Reaney continued to play at Elland Road until the end of the 1977‚Äì78 season when he was given a free transfer after 745 appearances. He joined neighbours Bradford City and then completed his playing career in Australia with Newcastle KB United. International career In 1968, Reaney won his first England cap, when he came on as a substitute in a match against Bulgaria. From that point on, he was regularly selected for the England squad (albeit not as first choice full-back) until a broken leg in 1970 prevented him from playing in the 1970 World Cup. The following year, he made his third and final appearance for England in a match against Malta. Reaney's appearance for England has assumed greater importance in recent years as even though he was regarded as \\"white\\" during his playing career, he is viewed by many as \\"black\\" or mixed race now. His England debut was nine years before that of Viv Anderson, who is widely credited as the first black player to appear for England. However, Reaney has stated that he does not consider himself a \\"Black\\" player. Post-playing career Since returning to England from Australia, Reaney has been running coaching sessions during school holidays for children at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton. In 1993, burglars broke into Reaney's home and stole a safe containing his collection of medals, though left behind his trophies, caps and other honours.

It is located at the junction of State Highways 4 and 49, 11 kilometres west of Ohakune. The 2013 New Zealand census recorded its population as 1,002. This constitutes a decrease of 3.2% or 33 people since the 2006 census. 65.3% of residents identified as MƒÅori, 55% European, 2.7% Pacific and 1.2% Asian (some people identified themselves in several ethnic groups and as a result percentages do not add up to 100). There is evidence of MƒÅori people living here in the fourteenth century. The Ngati Uenuku dwelled at Raetihi and Waimarino (now National Park). There is little evidence of large permanent settlements but hunting parties were common during warmer months. In 1887 the Government purchased the Waimarino block from the Maori. The first European settlement was at Karioi where sheep were grazed on open tussock land. The Waimarino block proved to be a ‚Äúpot of gold‚Äù. Between 1908 and 1947 it provided 700 million superficial feet of building timber. The remnants of 150 sawmills have been discovered. Now there are only two major mills operating permanently. One at Tangiwai & one at National Park. In its heyday the sawmilling of rimu, totara, kahikatea, matai and beech trees provided employment for numerous people in the area. Raetihi (originally called Makotuku due to the river flowing at the towns edge) became the focal point for travellers going between Wanganui and Waiouru. A thriving town emerged to serve the timber workers and those passing through. A trip North from Wanganui was not for the faint-hearted. The scenic ‚ÄúRiver Road‚Äù passing through Pipiriki was treacherous with primitive tracks and long falls if you left the track. Those who completed the journey to Raetihi found hospitality, accommodation, blacksmiths and saddlers for weary horses and supplies for their further travels north. RƒÅtana Church The great fire of 1918 was a terrible setback to many businesses and homeowners in Raetihi. The loss of numerous mills slowed the timber industry but it continued successfully into the 1940s. As decades passed, it emerged that the ‚Äòendless‚Äô supply of strong native timber was running out. The choice to replant forests in fast-growing pine was there, but in the middle of the 20th century the ability to treat this new soft wood for outdoor building was not available. Raetihi felt the loss of the timber industry more as each year passed. Farming was an option for some but it would never be as high an employer as the forests once provided. The Theatre Royal From the 1970s through to the 1990s, Raetihi fell into a state of depression similar to many rural New Zealand towns. While farming and forestry continue here, it is tourist activities like the 'Mountains to Sea Cycle Trail' and 'Whangani River Adventures' that provides the future for this historic town.  Railway and museum  Waimarino museum From 18 December 1917 to 1 January 1968, Raetihi was served by the Raetihi Branch, a branch line railway that diverged from the North Island Main Trunk in Ohakune. The station building remains in the town today, relocated from its original site and restored as part of the Waimarino Museum.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 27-30. The museum holds an archive of documents and photographs from the broader Ruapehu area, some of which are available online.Waimarino Museum, Archival pictures and documents, accessed 29 October 2007. It was originally situated on Station Road which lies off to the right over the Makotuku River bridge on the road to Ohakune. The railway reached Raetihi in 1917 and played a vital part in the logging industry. The line was closed to passengers in 1951 and shut completely in 1968 with the decline in tree felling & milling. The railway station building was moved to its present site on Seddon Street in 1981, seven years after the formation of the museum society. Two more buildings were moved to the museum site in 1983. They are the jail cells & stables. Both were originally by the Makotuku River. The museum holds documents, photographs and items of daily life showing the progression of the town from its beginnings as a MƒÅori settlement in the 19th century, the arrival of timber mills and large scale logging between 1900 and 1960 and the slow decline of the town following the end of the logging boom to the present. As is the case throughout New Zealand, the museum is run by volunteers and is open for viewing most weekends and by appointment. A number of archival photographs and documents are available for wider viewing on the museum's website.  History and culture  Vintage Building Waimarino County Offices (Former) Although now a small rural town, Raetihi was a minor industrial centre between 1900 and the 1950s. It had numerous timber mills which provided the bulk of employment to the region. As the timber was cleared, agriculture became more prominent in the local economy. The two most prominent agricultural activities are cattle farming and vegetable growing and they now provide the bulk of employment as the timber mills have closed. The decline of the timber industry negatively impacted upon Raetihi, but it has recently experienced some small growth due to tourism. Its close proximity to Mount Ruapehu and popular ski-fields has led to the establishment of accommodation and cafes to cater for the increasing number of visitors. = Timeline = The Bank Of New Zealand (Former) * 1892 -Raetihi is founded through the government purchase of the Waimarino Block.

Damask (; ) is a reversible figured fabric of silk, wool, linen, cotton, or synthetic fibers, with a pattern formed by weaving. Damasks are woven with one warp yarn and one weft yarn, usually with the pattern in warp-faced satin weave and the ground in weft-faced or sateen weave. Twill damasks include a twill-woven ground or pattern.Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: Textiles, 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, , p. 251Monnas, Lisa.

In China, drawlooms with a large number of heddles were developed to weave damasks with very complicated patterns. The Chinese may have produced damasks as early as the Tang Dynasty. Damasks derive their name from the city of Damascus‚Äîin that period a large city active both in trading (as part of the silk road) and in manufacture.\\"What is Damask Fabric\\", Period Home and Garden Damasks became scarce after the 9th century outside Islamic Spain, but were revived in some places in the 13th century. The word \\"damask\\" first appeared in records in a Western European language in the mid-14th century in French.\\"Damas\\" etymology (in French). By the 14th century, damasks were being woven on draw looms in Italy. From the 14th to 16th century, most damasks were woven in one colour with a glossy warp-faced satin pattern against a duller ground. Two-colour damasks had contrasting colour warps and wefts, and polychrome damasks added gold and other metallic threads or additional colours as supplemental brocading wefts. Medieval damasks were usually woven in silk, but weavers also produced wool and linen damasks. In the 19th century, the invention of the Jacquard loom, which was automated with a system of punched cards, made weaving damask faster and cheaper. Modern usage Damask as a tablecloth. Water droplet is lying on the surface due to low absorption of damask. Modern damasks are woven on computerized Jacquard looms. Damask weaves are commonly produced in monochromatic (single-colour) weaves in silk, linen, or synthetic fibres such as rayon and feature patterns of flowers, fruit, and other designs. The long floats of satin-woven warp and weft threads cause soft highlights on the fabric which reflect light differently according to the position of the observer. Damask weaves appear most commonly in table linens and furnishing fabrics, but they are also used for clothing. The damask weave is used extensively throughout the fashion industry due to its versatility and high-quality finish. Damask is usually used for mid-to-high-quality garments, meaning the label tends to have a higher definition and a more ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù look.

Founded in 1917 to preserve the legacy and vision of Col. William F. \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, the Buffalo Bill Center of the West is the oldest and most comprehensive museum complex of the West. It has been described by The New York Times as \\"among the nation's most remarkable museums.\\"Edward Rothstein, \\"At the Buffalo Bill Museum, a Showdown Between History and Myth\\", New York Times, 3 August 2012, accessed 6 April 2014. archive Background The complex can be traced to 1917, when the Buffalo Bill Memorial Association was established after the death of William F. Cody, the original Buffalo Bill. Gradually other elements were added to what started as a historical center. The current seven-acre building has more than 50,000 artifacts and holds five museums. Since 2008, the center has been part of the Smithsonian Affiliates program, the first museum complex in Wyoming to have this status. As an Affiliate, the Center of the West has hosted Smithsonian artifacts. It has also recently loaned some of its own vast collections to a Smithsonian exhibition in Washington, D.C. The museums are connected by a unifying \\"credo\\" (adopted 2010 by the Board of Trustees) that begins, \\"We believe in a spirit, definable and intellectually real, called 'The Spirit of the American West.'\\" The institution includes the recently reconceived Buffalo Bill Museum, which highlights Western ephemera and historic objects in telling the life story of W.

The old impulse to > demolish the myth has been put aside.  Buffalo Bill Museum  The inaugural museum opened in 1927 in a log cabin across from the current location. It was reinstalled in 1986, and it is now part of a five-museum complex. The museum offers a wide-ranging view of the life and times of William F. Cody, as well as of the \\"Buffalo Bill\\" character he created, which made him the world's most celebrated person of his time. The museum showcases the fame and success Cody attained through his \\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West show,\\" and addresses his influence on the economic and cultural development of the American West.  Plains Indians Museum  The museum features the stories and objects of Plains Indian people, their cultures, traditions, values and histories, as well as the contexts of their lives today. The first curator was George Horse-Capture, an enrolled member of the A'aninin tribe. The majority of the collection is from the early reservation period, ca. 1880-1930. It contains artifacts primarily from Northern Plains tribes, such as the Arapaho, Lakota, Crow, Cheyenne, Blackfeet and Pawnee. The holdings also include important contemporary objects, ranging from abstract art to star quilts. The museum also sponsors an annual Powwow held on the third weekend in June at the Robbie Powwow Garden at the Center of the West. This event attracts dancers, artisans, and visitors from all over North America.  Whitney Western Art Museum  The museum features paintings and sculptures of the American West. The gallery first opened in 1959 and was later united with the Buffalo Bill Museum. In June 2009, it re-opened following a re-installation.

Plot  In 1969, students Martin Brice and Cosmo are sneakers who hack into computer networks using university equipment, to redistribute conservative funds to various liberal causes. The police burst in and arrest Cosmo while Martin is out getting pizza, and Martin becomes a fugitive. In the present day, Martin, now called Martin Bishop, is running a team of security specialists in San Francisco undertaking penetration testing, including Donald Crease, a former CIA officer and family man; Darren \\"Mother\\" Roskow, a conspiracy theorist and electronics technician; Carl Arbogast, a young hacking genius; and Irwin \\"Whistler\\" Emery, a blind phone phreak. After breaking into a bank and exposing their weaknesses, Martin is approached by NSA officers Dick Gordon and Buddy Wallace, who know of his former identity. In exchange for clearing his record, he is asked to recover a \\"black box\\" from mathematician Dr. Gunter Janek, who has developed the box under the project name \\"Setec Astronomy\\" supposedly for the Russian government. Martin is hesitant but agrees to help. With help from his former girlfriend, Liz, Martin and his team secure the box, which is disguised as a telephone answering machine. During their subsequent celebration party, Whistler, Mother, and Carl investigate the box, finding it capable of breaking the encryption of nearly every computer system. Martin works out that \\"Setec Astronomy\\" is an anagram of \\"too many secrets\\", and issues a lockdown until they can deliver the box the next day. Martin hands the box to the NSA officers, but quickly leaves after Crease discovers that Janek was killed the night before. He contacts a friend named Gregor in the Russian consulate, who confirms that the officers were rogue agents, and that Janek was working for the NSA. Before Gregor can elaborate further, fake FBI agents kill him and kidnap Martin to a remote location where he's reunited with Cosmo, who Martin thought had died in prison. While in prison, Cosmo developed ties with organized crime, allowing him to escape and become wealthy. He explains his plan to use Janek's box to destabilize the world economy, and offers Martin the chance to join him. Martin refuses, whereupon Cosmo uses the box to break into the FBI and connect Martin's current identity with his former name. Cosmo has Martin knocked out and taken back to the city. Martin contacts his team and they relocate to Liz's apartment. They contact NSA agent Abbott, who wants the box but cannot offer assistance without it being in Martin's possession. Whistler analyzes the sounds that Martin heard during his kidnapping, and is able to identify the geographic area where Martin was taken. They find a toy company at that location, which is a front for Cosmo's operation. They track down Werner Brandes, the employee whose office is next to Cosmo's. They set Liz up with a fake computer date with Brandes to get his keycard and vocal recognition codes, while the others identify other security features of Cosmo's office. The team successfully gets into the building to recover the box. Brandes begins to suspect Liz during the date, and alerts Cosmo to a possible break- in. Once Liz mentions the computer date in Cosmo's presence, he realizes that Martin is responsible and locks down the facility and holds Martin at gunpoint. Again he tries to convince Martin to join him, but Martin refuses and instead turns over the box. The team escapes before Cosmo realizes that he is holding an empty duplicate of the box's case. Back at their offices, Martin's team is surrounded by agents led by Abbott. After Martin points out how important the secrecy of the box is to the NSA, who could use it to spy on other agencies, Abbott agrees to clear Martin's record and grant the requests of the rest of his team. After Abbott and the agents leave with the box, Martin shows his team he has rendered the box useless by taking out the main processor. In a postscript, a news report describes the sudden bankruptcy of the Republican National Committee, and the simultaneous receipt of large anonymous donations to Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and the United Negro College Fund.  Cast  * Robert Redford as Martin Bishop/Martin Brice * Ben Kingsley as Cosmo * Sidney Poitier as Donald Crease * David Strathairn as Irwin \\"Whistler\\" Emery * Dan Aykroyd as Darren \\"Mother\\" Roskow * River Phoenix as Carl Arbogast * Mary McDonnell as Liz Ogilvy * Stephen Tobolowsky as Werner Brandes * Timothy Busfield as Dick Gordon * Eddie Jones as Buddy Wallace * George Hearn as Gregor Ivanovich * Donal Logue as Dr. Gunter Janek * Lee Garlington as Dr. Elena Rhyzkov * James Earl Jones as NSA Agent Bernard Abbott  Production  Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes first conceived the idea for Sneakers in 1981, while doing research for WarGames. In early drafts, the character of Liz was a bank employee, rather than Martin's ex-girlfriend. The role was changed because Lasker and Parkes believed that it took too long for her character to develop. Once Robert Redford was attached to the picture, his name was used to recruit other members of the cast and crew, including the director Robinson, who had little initial interest in the project but had always wanted to work with Redford. At one point during the project, Robinson received a visit from men claiming to be representatives of the Office of Naval Intelligence, who indicated that for reasons of national security, the film could not include any references to \\"a hand-held device that can decode codes\\". Robinson was highly concerned, as such a device was a key to the film's plot, but after consulting with a lawyer from the film studio he realized that the \\"visit\\" had been a prank instigated by a member of the cast, possibly Aykroyd or Redford. \\"I can't remember having so much fun on a movie,\\" Stephen Tobolowsky recalled in 2012 for a 20th anniversary piece about the film for Slate. He had initially scoffed at the script based on its title alone, but his agent persuaded him to actually read it, and he reconsidered. Afterward, he told his agent, \\"Now I know what a hundred million dollars at the box office reads like.\\" \\"It was one of the most spectacular casts I've ever been lucky enough to be a part of,\\" Tobolowsky wrote. When he was shooting the scene where he and McDonnell eat at a Chinese restaurant, Robinson told him he could do anything he wanted to make her laugh. \\"Dangerous words. It set the tone for the rest of the shoot,\\" he recalls. \\"I played with my food. I made up lines (including one about pounding chicken breasts in the kitchen during our second date).\\" The rest of the cast and crew felt similarly. Near the end of the shoot Robinson said the only way it could have been better would have been if the lab lost the film, so they would have had to do it all over again. Leonard Adleman was the mathematical consultant on this movie.  Release  The film's press kit was accompanied by a floppy disk containing a custom program explaining the movie. Parts of the program were quasi-encrypted, requiring the user to enter an easily guessable password to proceed.  Reception  The film received positive reviews from critics upon its release. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan called Sneakers \\"[a] caper movie with a most pleasant sense of humor,\\" a \\"twisting plot,\\" and a \\"witty, hang-loose tone.\\" Turan went on to praise the ensemble cast and director Robinson, who is \\"surprisingly adept at creating tension at appropriate moments\\" and \\"makes good use of the script's air of clever cheerfulness\\". Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, was less impressed, giving the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \\"a sometimes entertaining movie, but thin.\\" He went on to point out numerous cliches and tired plot devices recycled in the film. Vincent Canby, in a negative review for The New York Times, said the film looked like it had \\"just surfaced after being buried alive for 20 years,\\" calling it \\"an atrophied version of a kind of caper movie that was so beloved in the early 1970's\\". He singled out Redford and Poitier as looking and acting too old to be in this kind of film now. He calls the plot \\"feeble,\\" resulting in a film that is \\"jokey without being funny, breathless without creating suspense\\". He calls the ensemble an \\"all star gang,\\" but says the \\"performances are generally quite bad.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 79% based on reviews from 52 critics. The website's consensus states: \\"There isn't much to Sneakers plot and that's more than made up for with the film's breezy panache and hi-tech lingo.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on scale of A to F. The film was a box office success, grossing over $105.2 million worldwide. TV series In October 2016, NBC was developing a TV series based on the film. Writer Walter Parkes was brought on as an executive producer.

The building was completed in 1929 and, despite extensive refurbishment, still retains much of the style of the pre-Depression era. History In 1887 the Paramount Chief of Ngati T≈´wharetoa, Horonuku Te Heu Heu T≈´kino gifted the tribe's land ‚Äì including the sacred mountain peaks of Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe and Tongariro ‚Äì to the people of New Zealand. The gifting was to ensure the area's protection for all time, for all people. In the early 20th century, the approach to Whakapapa was only for the fit and strong. There were miles upon miles of wild country to cross on foot or horseback, wild rivers to ford and mountainous terrain to navigate. Climbers Bill Mead and Bernard Drake imported the first skis seen in the North Island in 1913, and in July of that year were the first to attempt to ski on Mount Ruapehu. They realised the Whakapapa Vallet was \\"much better than any other area of Ruapehu for skiing as well as for summer parties, if it could only be given road access and huts.\\" In 1919 Bill Mead persuaded the Department of Tourist and Health Resorts to pay for an access road to Whakapapa. The new 'highway' was pushed through towards Mt Ruapehu with the help of labour from the Whakapapa prison camp early in 1925 under the supervision of Dave Dunlop, and in 1925 Sir James Gunson drove the first car to Whakapapa. The Ruapehu Ski Club built a collection of huts which became Whakapapa Village. =Construction= Ngauruhoe from the blue sofa in the sitting area (\\" Mount Doom \\") In 1923, the newly-established Tongariro National Park Board investigated a site for a 100-bed hostel in order to encourage tourists to visit the newly formed Park, but it wasn't until 1925 that New Zealand Government, via the National Park Board, followed up this initiative by offering to lease land and lend up to ¬£40,000 to any private company which would build and operate a hotel on the site.Goldsmith. Page 56. Rodolph Lysaght Wigley (1881‚Äì1946), the managing director of the Mount Cook Tourist Company, took up the option. He formed the Tongariro Park Tourist Company with a vision to build what was at the time known as The Chateau, alongside the original Whakapapa ski huts, on a land lease of 63 acres. To raise capital for the undertaking the company was floated on the sharemarket, where it was poorly subscribed. The company signed a lease with the government on 9 November 1928, a condition of which was that the building had to be erected by 31 March 1930 (barely 17 months away) and that it \\"cost not less than ¬£40,000 or more than ¬£60,000\\".Smith. Page 144. Despite only ¬£30,000 of shares being taken up, Wigley let a contact in late 1928 to Fletcher Construction Company, which also involved Fletchers buying 15,000 of shares in the Tongariro Park Tourist Company.Goldsmith. Page 56. The Chateau was designed by Timaru-based Herbert Hall (1880‚Äì1939), architect to the Mount Cook Tourist Company, who modelled his design on the Canadian Resort of Lake Louise. Influenced by the hotels built by the Canadian Pacific Railway such as the Ch√¢teau Frontenac, he designed a neo-Georgian structure of four stories and basement. The style of the building was not European, despite its name, but American Colonial Revival, a variant of the Georgian Revival style popular between the wars. It is possibly the only building in New Zealand made of reinforced concrete but designed to resemble a traditional Georgian brick building. The foundation stone was laid on 10 January 1929. Fletchers used a workforce of 120 carpenters and labourers, offering an incentive of free accommodation and a free suit to workers who stayed until the completion of the project. Most of the labourers were recruited from the Waikune Prison, which was the closest neighbour to the construction site. The building was open for guests by 1 August 1929, even though it was still unfurnished. It was officially opened on 13 November 1929 with Fletcher Construction still owed ¬£28,000.Goldsmith. Page 57.Winter 1950s The hotel was lavishly appointed, with panoramic window views, hot and cold running water in every room, and custom- made high-quality furniture. Most of the staff were recruited from overseas. The innovative heating system used enormous boiling-water tanks in the basement and pumped hot water up five storeys; originally coal or oil heated, it was switched to electricity and still operates today. The total cost was ¬£88,000 (well over the contract price) of which the hotel had cost ¬£78,000, while at the request of the Tourist Company another ¬£10,000 had been spent building extra wooden buildings, a garage and a golf course in the front of the hotel. The golf course was designed by an architect serving a prison sentence and built by prison labour.Smith. Page 145. Wigley had led Fletchers to believe that if they overspent the company would be reimbursed by the Mount Cook Tourist Company. Unfortunately due to the Depression it was in difficulties and so would not pay for the increased expenditure. James Fletcher, the head of the company, approached the Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward and asked him to increase the government loan to ¬£60,000. Ward agreed and Fletcher obtained a promise from Wigley that the bulk of this injection of money would go to pay Fletchers. The Tongariro Park Tourist Company was by now in serious financial trouble, which was not helped by spending lavishly fitting out the hotel. Wigley reneged on the deal and passed on only ¬£10,000. The onset of the depression delayed hopes of a tourism boom; to secure their debt Fletchers put the Tongariro Park Tourist Company into receivership in February 1931, took control of the hotel, and ran it for 3 months before walking away with a loss of ¬£19,000, (which included ¬£1000 of losses incurred during their period of ownership).Smith. Page 145. =Government ownership= Spring 2009 In 1932 the hotel was taken over by the National Park Board, who quickly transferred the title to the Department of Tourist and Health Resorts, which owned and ran the hotel for the next 26 years. Over this period, the hotel manager not only ran the Chateau, but also Tongariro National Park. The sole park ranger, Alf Cowling, was told \\"his services were to be at the disposal of the Manager of The Chateau, and that his horse was to be available when not otherwise required for hiring out to guests.\\" The numbers of skiing tourists declined during World War II, so in 1942 the Chateau was commandeered by the Health Department as an asylum when the Wairarapa earthquakes damaged Porirua Psychiatric Institution in Wellington. In late 1945 Ruapehu erupted over a ten month period, and the heavy showers of ash disrupted the Chateau's power and water supply; the patients were evacuated to Auckland. The Chateau then served as a rest and recuperation centre for Air Force personnel returning from service in World War II.http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/media/127126/tourism%20centenary.pdf . Retrieved 14 February 2011. After the War was a boom time for Whakapapa skifield, with the installation of ski-tows, chair lifts, and new facilities. In August 1948, newly renovated, Chateau Tongariro reopened to provide accommodation for increasing numbers of visitors. In 1957, control of the hotel passed to the newly-created Tourist Hotel Corporation (THC) of New Zealand, which also developed the Whakapapa skifield. The hotel rooms were gradually upgraded and reduced in number from 90 to 64, but the profitability of the Chateau declined. =Private ownership= The lobby In 1990, during a period of Government privatisation of assets, the Chateau was sold to KAH New Zealand Limited, a subsidiary of Oriental Holdings Berhad (OHB), a Malaysian- based conglomerate owned by the Loh family with hotel and restaurant holdings in Singapore and Malaysia. The new owners invested NZ$3 million in refurbishing the complex and renamed it The Grand Chateau (although it is still widely referred to as Chateau Tongariro); the ski area was sold to a separate company. In 2005 a new five-storey wing costing NZ$6 million and containing 40 rooms and replicating the style of the original building was opened. To avoid disturbing guests the expansion used a Scandinavian system of modular construction with the rooms built in Auckland and trucked to the site where they were installed using a crane. A presidential suite, renovated in 1994‚Äì1995, occupies the top floor. The Chateau is currently operated by Bayview International Hotels and Resorts, which is also a subsidiary of Oriental Holdings Berhad (OHB).http://www.bayviewhotels.com/index.cfm?id=33C942D4-7E9F-33E6-3B7191CB05702F1A . Retrieved 14 February 2011. After the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, skiing holidays dropped off, and KAH New Zealand posted losses for four straight years, totalling $1.9 million, before making a profit again in 2016. In 2020, in response to the loss of overseas tourists from the coronavirus epidemic, the Chateau offered discounted ($70 a night) rooms and had over 3500 bookings over May and June, normally quiet months. Tourism New Zealand raised the possibility of resorts like Chateau Tongariro being purchased by the Government, as was done in 1932, but this was rejected.Ski clubs on the Whakapapa ski fields above the Chateau Power supply Power to the complex was initially provided by a coal fired furnace which heated water which was then circulated around the complex to provide heating and 100 kW hydro power station in the Whakapapanui Stream which provided power for lighting and cooking.Reilly. Pages 46, 85. By the early 1950s the existing power supplies at the complex were becoming inadequate. In June 1952 the Ministry of Works requested the King Country Electric Power Board to provide a 500 to 600 kW power supply to the Chateau. This resulted in an 8.5-mile long overhead 11 kV transmission line being constructed and commissioned in 1955. This not only supplied power to the chateau but also to the Whakapapa ski field and to several mountain huts on Mount Ruapehu.Reilly. Pages 85 and 86. In the early 1960s a second line was constructed and commissioned in 1964 by the King Country Electric Power Board to improve the reliability of supply to the Chateau and to other customers in the area.Reilly.

This event is organized by Forum Foundation. The first Forum was held in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain), from May 9 to September 26, 2004. It was organized by Barcelona's local council, the Catalan government (the Generalitat de Catalunya), the Spanish Government and UNESCO. It was conceived by Catalan prime mover (Pasqual Maragall, then Mayor of Barcelona) as a way of promoting the city's burgeoning tourist industry in the wake of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The official aims of the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures included support for peace, sustainable development, human rights and respect for cultural diversity. However, many NGOs (including Greenpeace and Amnesty International) criticised the event for failing to live up to these lofty ideals and boycotted it as a result. The event was controversial, with critics pointing to the $2.3 billion price tag and commercial sponsorship by multinationals (Endesa, Nestl√©, Coca-Cola, Telef√≥nica, and Indra) with dubious reputations in the Third World. Several groups also criticised the massive property and coastline destruction involved in building the Forum site. This may explain why the Forum fell so far short of its projected attendance figures for the 141-day event. The forecasts were progressively scaled back from the planning stage, to 7 million and then 5 million during the event. The official final attendance figure was around 3.5 million, although even this figure is hotly disputed. The 2007 Universal Forum of Cultures was held in Monterrey, Mexico. The event promoted Native American and \\"White\\" cultures. For the third edition (2010), candidate cities were Chicago (United States), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Fukuoka (Japan), Alexandria (Egypt), Suwon and Gwangju (South Korea), Santiago de Chile and Valpara√≠so (Chile), Budapest (Hungary) and Durban (South Africa). Valpara√≠so, Chile was selected as host for the 2010 Universal Forum of Cultures. Naples, Italy was selected as host for the 2013 Universal Forum of Cultures, while both Quebec City, Canada and Amman, Jordan were selected to host the 2016 forum. Quebec City decided to back off and give Amman the whole organisation of the event.

Headquartered on South Fifth Street in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the former headquarters of the American Lutheran Church, Augsburg Fortress publishes Living Lutheran (founded 1831, named The Lutheran until 2016), the Lutheran Book of Worship (1978), the Lutheran Study Bible, and Evangelical Lutheran Worship (2006), as well as a range of academic, reference and educational books. Tim Blevins has served as the CEO of 1517 Media since August, 2018. Beth Lewis served as the CEO of Augsburg Fortress since September 3, 2002. History Augsburg Fortress was formed in 1988 when the Fortress Press of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Augsburg Publishing House of Minneapolis, Minnesota, merged as their parent denominations, the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) and the American Lutheran Church (ALC) merged to form the ELCA, with headquarters at the Lutheran Center on West Higgins Road in suburban Chicago, Illinois. Augsburg Publishing House was affiliated with The American Lutheran Church. It had been founded in 1891 at Augsburg Seminary in Minneapolis Scandinavian Review, Volume 9, American-Scandinavian Foundation., 1921, Page 145 Both the publishing house and seminary were part of the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America (UNLC). The publishing house left the seminary campus in 1894, relocating to the downtown area in 1908. By 1960 it had become the publishing house of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. With the 1960 merger of Lutheran denominations that formed the \\"new\\" American Lutheran Church, Augsburg was designated that church's publishing arm. It absorbed the publishing houses of the other denominations that participated in the merger, including Wartburg Press (established 1881) of the \\"old\\" American Lutheran Church in Columbus, Ohio; and the Danish Lutheran Publishing House (established 1893) of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church in Blair, Nebraska. When the Lutheran Free Church joined the ALC in 1963, its publishing house, Messenger Press (established 1922), was also added. Augsburg, and Wartburg before it, had published the old ALC denominational magazine The Lutheran Standard, which had ancestry back to the 1840s in the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio. Fortress Press was the publishing arm of the Lutheran Church in America, headquartered in northwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the Muhlenberg Building, a unique U-shaped brick Georgian architecture style structure named for Henry Melchoir Muhlenberg and other members of the Muhlenberg family who were important in American Lutheranism. Henry is considered the \\"Patriarch of American Lutheranism\\" and the prime organizer of the first Lutheran synod in America, the Pennsylvania Ministerium in 1746. The LCA came into existence in 1962 with the merger of several smaller Lutheran denominations. The largest forerunner of the Fortress Press was the Muhlenberg Press of the United Lutheran Church in America, the largest partner in the LCA merger. The oldest ancestor was the Henkel Press, started by the son of Paul Henkel, a famous late 18th - early 19th century Lutheran pastor, missionary, and evangelist in the Appalachian Mountains region. Fortress published The Lutheran, the monthly magazine of the LCA and also of the earlier United Lutheran Church in America. The magazine had its beginnings in 1831 in publications of the General Synod. In July 2016, the company re- branded as 1517 Media. They continue to use Augsburg Fortress as an imprint for church resources and Fortress Press as an imprint for academic and reference titles. Other imprints include Beaming Books, Broadleaf Books, and Sparkhouse.

Baumann composed his first solo album in 1976, while still touring with the band, and embarked on a solo career in 1977. He founded the record label Private Music. Since the early 2000s, Baumann has devoted his time to studying and promoting initiatives in science and philosophy that shed light on the human condition.  Background  Peter Baumann was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1953, his father a composer, his mother an actress. When he was eight, the Berlin Wall was built, and Baumann entered the American/German Community School in Berlin, where he learned English and was first exposed to American culture. At age 14, Peter joined a cover band and performed at G.I. clubs. Then, in 1971, at age 18, he met Christopher Franke, and ended up joining Tangerine Dream as a replacement for their former organist Steve Schroyder. Two years later, Tangerine Dream signed with Virgin Records and their first album on the label, Phaedra, became a Top 10 seller on the Melody Maker charts. As a result of this and other recording successes, Tangerine Dream toured the world for eight years. They also made successful forays into film scoring. Baumann had temporarily left Tangerine Dream twice, first in 1973 (returning in time for Franke & Froese to shelf their current work on Green Desert and the three to start anew on what was to become Phaedra), and again in 1975, leaving Michael Hoenig as a temporary substitute for an Australian tour. His departure in 1977, shortly after the completion of the band's first U.S. tour, was final and led to a brief solo career. During the 1980s, he founded a record label, Private Music, specializing in instrumental music in a style popularly referred to as new-age. Artists signed to the label included Yanni, Patrick O'Hearn, Jerry Goodman, Suzanne Ciani, and former bandmates Tangerine Dream. In 1996, the label was sold to Windham Hill Records' parent company, BMG, who continue to distribute some of the back catalogue of its more successful artists.  The Baumann Foundation  Following his music career, Peter Baumann moved to San Francisco, where in 2009 he founded the Baumann Foundation: a think-tank that explores the experience of being human in the context of cognitive science, evolutionary theory and philosophy. The foundation pursues its fundamental mission, to foster greater clarity about the human condition, by organizing initiatives that facilitate scientific research and promote discussions between scientists, contemplatives, and the public. The Baumann Foundation's main initiative is Beinghuman.org, a social website designed to spark a global conversation about how current developments in fields like behavioral economics, cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, genetics, anthropology, and philosophy can help people make sense of their experiences. In 2012 the foundation sponsored Being Human 2012, an interdisciplinary conference held in San Francisco‚Äôs Palace of Fine Arts that brought together neuroscientists, philosophers, evolutionary theorists and meditation experts to hold a public dialogue about the nature of humanity. Baumann is the co- author, with Michael W. Taft, of the 2011 book Ego: The Fall of the Twin Towers and the Rise of an Enlightened Humanity. The book draws on new research in neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and other scientific fields to examine the origin and history of the human ego and the evolutionary implications of the September 11 attacks.  Personal life  Baumann has been married to Alison Baumann since 1983, and has three children. He is the director of several real estate and natural resource companies. In addition to creating the Baumann foundation, he is on the board of directors of the California Institute of Integral Studies and is a fellow of the Mind and Life Institute.

Gourmand originally referred to a person who was \\"a glutton for food and drink\\", a person who eats and drinks excessively;gourmand this usage is now rare. Description The word (from French) has different connotations from the similar word gourmet, which emphasises an individual with a discerning palate,, and is more often applied to the preparer than the consumer of the food. But in practice, the two terms are closely linked, as both imply the enjoyment of good food. An alternative and older usage of the word is to describe a person given to excess in the consumption of food and drink, as a glutton or a trencherman. Regarding the latter usage of the term, there is a parallel concern among the French that their word for the appreciation of gourmet cuisine () is historically included in the French Catholic list of the seven deadly sins. With the evolution in the meaning of (and ) away from gluttony and towards the connoisseur appreciation of good food, French culinary proponents are advocating that the Catholic Church update said list to refer to rather than . Another alternative use has gained popularity among perfume and cologne designers. In this field, gourmand refers not to a person but to a category of scents related to foods, such as cocoa, apple, and plum.

Variants A typical break-action, double-barreled shotgun. A way of closing the breech or chamber is an essential part of any breech-loading weapon or firearm. Perhaps the simplest way of achieving this is a break-action, in which the barrel, forestock and breech pivot on a hinge that joins the front assembly to the rear of the firearm, incorporating the rear of the breech, the butt and usually, the trigger mechanism. A breechblock is a separate component and is not a feature of the break-action. A breechblock must close against the breech for firing but be able to be retracted or otherwise moved for loading or unloading or to remove a spent cartridge. This article primarily addresses the matter of breechblock design, as opposed to the action, which relates more with how the mechanism is operated, even if the distinction is not always clear. = Rotating bolt = Usually referred to as a bolt rather than a breechblock, a rotating bolt is perhaps the most common variant. It is so called, because its operation is similar to a pad bolt or barrel bolt. The bolt slides in the receiver along the axis of the barrel and is rotated in the same axis to lock or unlock it against a closed breech. It is the basis for the bolt action, in which the bolt is rotated and retracted by an handle attached to the bolt. In some designs, the handle (sometimes called a cocking handle) rotates to lock against a shoulder in the receiver or body of the firearm. This type of locking is usually reserved for low-pressure applications such as the .22 cal rimfire series. More often, the bolt locks closed with two or more lugs that operate like a bayonet mount. Multiple lugs permit a smaller degree of rotation to lock and unlock the breech. Most types are front-locking and have the lugs mounted near the breech face. A notable exception is the rear-locking system used in the Lee‚ÄìEnfield. File:Bayonet-mount-01.svg A rotating bolts locks in a way similar to a bayonet mount, such as shown here (but with much stronger lugs and locking grooves than shown) File:Rotating Bolt.png Operation of a rotating bolt.

File:MauserSystem98Verschluss-03.jpg A Mauser 98 bolt showing two locking lugs just behind the face of the bolt. There is a third \\"emergency\\" lug in front of the bolt handle, in case the primary ones fail under pressure. In some designs the bolt handle itself may serve as the emergency \\"lug\\".

File:SMLEAction.jpg A Lee-Enfield Mk III rifle with the bolt pulled back. The bolt lugs lock into the receiver bridge and are rear-locking. File:Winchester1200Def-2.jpg The Winchester Model 1200 uses a rotating bolt. File:Browning BLR.jpg The Browning BLR uses a rotating bolt Rotating bolts can be adapted to automatic or semi-automatic designs and lever or pump actions. In these cases, the bolt is held by a bolt carrier. With the breech locked, an initial rearward movement of the bolt carrier causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. Similarly, when closing the breech, the final forward movement of the carrier causes the bolt to rotate and lock the breech. This action is commonly achieved by a slot cut in the carrier that engages a pin through the bolt perpendicular to the axis of the barrel. It is a type of linear cam. Straight-pull bolt-action firearms do not require the operator to rotate the cocking handle to cycle the action. Some straight-pull designs may use a rotating bolt but other breech-locking mechanisms can be employed. = Sliding block = The breechblock in a sliding block slides across the face of the breech to close it. The sliding action is perpendicular to the axis of the barrel. When the breechblock slides down to expose the breech, it is referred to as a falling block, as used in the Sharps rifle. A sliding block is common in artillery. A vertical sliding block rises and falls while an horizontal sliding block slides to one side. It is a strong design. The breechblock is well supported by the receiver within which it slides and the mechanisms for opening and closing the breech do not have to act to any extent against the forces generated on firing.

A side hinged breechblock is used in the Snider-Enfield and the Warner carbine. The breechblock is hinged parallel to the axis of the barrel and swings away to the side to expose the breech. Firing force is contained by the rear of the breechblock bearing on the receiver. = Trapdoor breechblock = Springfield model 1888, breech open Commonly associated with the Springfield rifle, the breechblock is hinged above the breech face and lifts up like a trapdoor to expose the breech. The breech is locked by a catch operating at the end of the breechblock furthest from the hinge. It is similar in principle to a break- action. = Rolling block = A rolling block can be described as a quadrant which is hinged below the breech. The quadrant rotates through approximately 90¬∞ to provide access to the breech or close the breech. In the closed position, a number of different devices can be used to lock the quadrant and prevent it from opening. In the Remington Rolling Block rifle most closely associated with this type of breechblock, the hammer also has a quadrant which cams behind the breechblock and locks it. The Spencer repeating rifle also uses a rolling block. Remington Rolling Block.jpg The Remington rolling- block breech. = Peabody-Martini = Initially used in the Peabody rifle, it saw more widespread use in the Martini‚ÄìHenry and the subsequent Martini‚ÄìEnfield. It employs a breechblock with a rear hinged falling block design, in which the breech is opened by permitting the front of the breechblock to drop down while pivoting on its hinge. Firing force is transmitted through the knuckle of the hinge and does not act directly on the hinge pin. The breechblock design as has been called a falling or tilting block but in omitting the role of the hinge can lead to ambiguities. It is also used in the Krag‚ÄìPetersson rifle.

Peabody rifle.jpg  The Peabody rifle, which has an external hammer. = Tilting block = As a tilting breechblock closes on the breech, it is tilted up at the rear but it drops into a recess at the end of its forward travel - thus locking the breech closed. Firing forces are transmitted to the locking shoulder at the rear of the recess. To unlock the breech, a slide or carrier moving rearward uses a wedge like arrangement acting on the sides of the breechblock to tilt it up at the rear and lift it clear of the locking shoulder. The breechblock is then pulled rearward by the slide or carrier to expose the breech. In the closed position. the slide or carrier can also help locate the breechblock in its locking recess. The carrier or slide can be operated by lever or pump actions or by gas, for automatic and semiautomatic fire. = In-line = The breech is opened by the breechblock moving in-line with the axis of the barrel and is locked in the closed position by an obstruction such as a cam, wedge, paw or over-centre levers. A roller lock is commonly associated with firearms produced by Heckler & Koch. This type of breechblock can be adapted to cycle by lever, cocking handle or gas. The mechanism is usually designed so that a single action unlocks and then withdraws the breechblock using either a slide or levers. The M1895 Lee Navy is of this general type, even if the travel of the breechblock is not strictly in-line with the axis of the barrel. M1895 US Navy Straight Pull Rifle.jpg The M1895 Lee Navy. Henry Rifle Receiver open.JPG  The Henry rifle uses a toggle to lock the breechblock in place. = Blowback = Animation of simple blowback operation. Blowback actions use an in-line breechblock in which the breech is never locked and is held closed by spring tension alone. They are used in semiautomatic and automatic firearms using low-powered cartridges. It is common in semiautomatic rifles and pistol chambered for .22 cal rimfire cartridges and many submachine guns. A variation is blow forward operation, in which the breechblock is fixed and the barrel moves. = Floating actions = In most longarms, the barrel is firmly attached to the receiver and does not move relative to the receiver during operations. Most semiautomatic pistols firing the higher powered pistol cartridges use a locked-breech design. The action is manually cycled by moving the slide rearward. The slide contains the breechblock and is initially locked to the barrel so that the combined assembly move together. A short movement trips the mechanism to unlock the barrel from the slide assembly, allowing the breech to open. When fired, recoil results in the same action. In many instances, the barrel and breechblock remain in-line. In the Browning Hi-Power and Colt's M1911 pistol, the barrel is tilted slightly to release it from interlocking ribs, so in this respect, it may be likened to a tilting breechblock, even though it is the barrel and not the breechblock that tilts. This type of breechblock configuration and recoil operation is not confined to pistols and may be found in machine guns and auto-firing cannons. 1911A1-JH02.jpg A M1911A1 pistol disassembled and showing the locking grooves on the barrel. Luger IMG 6761b.jpgSwiss Parabellum Model 1900 Luger with breech opened, showing the jointed, toggle, locking arm in its most bent position. Locktab.jpg  Roller locks in the CZ 52 pistol. When fired, slide and barrel move rearward but the locking piece in the slide is held by the tab indicated by the pointer. = Interrupted screw = 16-inch Mk 6 gun on USS Alabama (BB-60), 1943. Note the four separate thread \\"steps\\" on the block which engage with matching steps in the breech when the block is swung up and inwards and then rotated slightly clockwise. The design allows thread to be machined on four-fifths of the circumference but requires only a one-fifth turn to disengage. A conventional interrupted thread would have thread on only half of its circumference and would need to be much longer to achieve the same strength. Perhaps a variation on the rotating bolt, an interrupted screw provides greater strength than simple lugs while requiring only a partial rotation to release the breechblock. The Welin breechblock is such a design and is used on weapons with calibres from about 4 inches up to 16 inches or more. = Falling screwed breechblock = The Ferguson rifle used a tapered screw plug inserted perpendicular to the axis of the barrel. It was charged with ball and powder and required only one rotation to permit loading. While novel and effective, cost was a factor for its limited acceptance. Ferguson rifle.jpgFerguson Rifle. = Split breech = A less common type of breech is the split-breech design known as the \\"nutcracker\\". This type of breech consists of two counter-rotating sprockets, with a temporary breech being formed where they touch. Relatively few guns have used this design. The prototype Fokker-Leimberger multiple-barreled machine gun used this design, but it had numerous problems with ruptured cases.–ü—É–ª–µ–º—ë—Ç Fokker-Leimberger (–ì–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω–∏—è), www.dogswar.ru/oryjeinaia-ekzotika/strelkovoe-oryjie/6274-pylemet- fokker-leimb.html Another \\"Fokker Split Breech Rotary Machine Gun, ca. 1930\\" was donated to Kentucky Military Treasures; according to the museum record it \\"proved unsuccessful because of its inability to seal breech cylinders\\". A couple of 1920s US patents by other inventors also proposed to use this principle. The British also experimented with the design in the 1950s for aircraft guns, without success. It has only been used successfully in low- pressure applications, such as the Mk 18 Mod 0 grenade launcher. In artillery the forces are much greater, but similar methods are used. The Welin breech block uses an interrupted screw and is used on weapons with calibres from about 4 inches up to 16 inches or more. Other systems use a horizontal or vertical sliding block, in which a solid block is slid across the open breech from the side or bottom to seal the opening.

This can be caused by infection, inflammation, autoimmune conditions, congenital defects, eyelid agenesis and trauma such as burns or eyelid injury. It is the leading cause of infectious blindness in the world. Standard treatment involves removal or destruction of the affected eyelashes with electrology, specialized laser, or surgery. In many cases, removal of the affected eyelashes with forceps resolves the symptoms, although the problem often recurs in a few weeks when the eyelashes regrow. Severe cases may cause scarring of the cornea and lead to vision loss if untreated. Mild cases may not require treatment. Repeated cases of trachoma infection may cause trichiasis. Posterior misdirection of normal lashes most frequently affects lower lid. In Dogs Trichiasis in dogs is hair from the eyelid growing in the wrong direction and rubbing on the eye, causing irritation. It usually occurs at the lateral upper eyelid, especially in the English Cocker Spaniel. Trichiasis also refers to hair from a nasal fold rubbing on the eye.

It investigated the motives of the Western Australian Gallop government in proposing and passing the bill. Background The Nyungah Aboriginal peoples have made attempts to reclaim their traditional land since 1919 when the Guildford Aboriginals were transhipped to the Moore River native settlement. Robert Bropho, an Aboriginal elder, and his extended family campaigned vigorously for the right to occupy the area which presently takes in Reserve 43131. The SVNC was established in 1977 and under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 they were given control of the reserve. On 12 February 1999 a 15-year-old Aboriginal woman named Susan Taylor committed suicide in the reserve7.30 Report - 15 August 2002: Call for national response to child sex abuse report and on 22‚Äì30 October 2001 a coronial inquiry was held. The inquest investigated the circumstances in which Taylor and other Aboriginal young people lived. It accepted evidence that rape and sexual abuse of Aboriginal minors was widespread in Western Australia, that sexually transmitted diseases were higher than with non-Aboriginal children, that Aboriginal mortality rates are many times higher than that of the non- Aboriginal community, and that drug taking with Aboriginal people was a major problem. The Coroner also heard evidence \\"regarding alleged sexual abuse taking place in locations near the Reserve by Caucasian males providing paint or glue to young people for sexual favours. Allegations were also made against Bropho of sexual misconduct, involving Taylor and her mother Lena Spratt. An allegation of indecent assault made by Taylor against Bropho's son, Richard Bropho, was not pursued due to her death and a lack of corroborating evidence. Robert and Richard Bropho have strenuously denied these allegations.\\" (2.28, page 57, Select Committee) The coroner found that government departments should not be restricted from Aboriginal reserves due to the alleged situation of abuse in Aboriginal communities. Allegations were also made that Robert Bropho had stopped the Aboriginal Medical Service from visiting the reserve due to the death of an infant, and in 1996 had also stopped the Department of Family and Children's Services after a child had disclosed inappropriate touching by older boys. =Gordon Inquiry= In the aftermath of the coronial inquiry, the Western Australian government established an inquiry entitled Inquiry into Response by Government Agencies to Complaints of Family Violence and Child Abuse in Aboriginal Communities,Report of the Inquiry... or better known as the Gordon Inquiry after the chairwoman, Family Court Magistrate Sue Gordon. It was announced on 29 November 2001 by the Premier of Western Australia, Geoff Gallop. Its terms of reference were to examine the way that \\"Government agencies dealt with issues of violence and child sexual abuse at the Swan Valley Nyoongar community\\", to examine \\"how State Government agencies respond to evidence of family violence and child sexual abuse that may be occurring in Aboriginal communities generally\\", and to give \\"recommendations on practical solutions for addressing incidents of sexual abuse in Aboriginal communities, including any necessary legislative and administrative measures\\".Report of the Inquiry..., p. xx.

The Report concluded that he had \\"completely bypassed the convention that public servants should advise vigorously and honestly and governments should decide in the light of their advice\\".Report of the Inquiry..., 30. It suggested that Walsh's conduct constituted a disciplinary offence under section 74 of the 1994 Public Sector Management Act.

Muetterties in 1963 for the structural analysis of pentacoordinate phosphorus fluorides by 19F NMR. Since the apical bonding of a pentacoordinate typical (group 1, 2, 13-18) element compound consists of a 3-center-4-electron bond, in which the electron density is localized on two apical substituents, an arrangement in which electronegative substituents occupy apical positions is more stable. The apicophilicity of a substituent is defined as the difference in energy between two isomeric structures in which the substituent occupies an apical position and an equatorial position (Leq). Experimentally, instead of direct measurement of the energy difference, which is usually difficult to measure, the relative energy barriers for pseudorotation of isomers are used for determination of the apicophilicity scale. Some experimental and theoretical studies have been made to measure relative apicophilicities for various substituents. The apicophilicity of a substituent mainly depends on its electronegativity, but some other factors can also have an effect. A bulky substituent prefers equatorial positions, which are more distant from other substituents. A substituent with œÄ-bonding ability also prefers equatorial positions. The use of multidentate ligands can also control the arrangement of substituents. For example, a bidentate ligand with a five- membered ring structure greatly stabilizes the arrangement in which their two coordination sites occupy equatorial and an apical position.

The primary north-south route though the central portion of the Niagara Peninsula, Highway 406 connects Welland, Thorold and downtown St. Catharines to the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW). Construction of Highway 406 began in 1963. The first section opened between St. Davids Road and Geneva Street on December 7, 1965, followed by a southward extension to Beaverdams Road in late 1969. The route was later extended south as a super two to Merritt Road where it became Highway 58\\\\. In 1977, construction began to connect the freeway with the QEW; this was completed in late 1984. Construction on the route resumed in 1987, connecting the route with East Main Street in Welland, completed in 1995. In 2009 construction resumed on the highway to expand the remaining two lane sections to a four-lane divided freeway, with the existing route becoming the southbound lanes of the new freeway. The southern terminus in Welland was converted to a roundabout while the remaining at-grade intersections were rebuilt as interchanges.  Route description  From 1987 until 2015, Highway 406 was unique as the only 400-series highway with two lane sections and with an at-grade rail crossing. The highway is heavily travelled within St. Catharines, but volumes drop considerably south of the city. The speed limit on Highway 406 varies from to . It is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police. The 406 designation begins at East Main Street in Welland at a roundabout immediately west of East Main Street Tunnel beneath the Welland Canal. From here the now-four-lane divided road veers northeast and travels parallel to the canal. Two golf courses separate the canal. As the highway passes to the west of them, it jogs to the west and crosses a Trillium Railway spur (formerly at-grade, now over the railway), and meets Daimler Parkway and Woodlawn Road at a newly constructed interchange. Soon after, it crosses the Welland River and then the former channel of the canal, which was replaced by the current Welland By-Pass in the 1970s. The highway curves to the northwest as it passes through thick forest, and meets another newly built interchange with Merritt Road (formerly Highway 58), which as of 2009 was being rebuilt as a grade-separated interchange. After this, it returns to its northward orientation and passes the final former at-grade intersection, Niagara Regional Road 63 (Port Robinson Road). Highway 406 in downtown St. Catharines North of Port Robinson Road, the forests break and the freeway continues straight north for through a mostly agricultural area. Along the straightaway are interchanges with former Highway 20 and Niagara Regional Road 67 (Beaverdams Road). The freeway crosses over Lake Gibson, infamous for its connection with the crimes of Paul Bernardo, and curves to the northeast. It passes beneath Niagara Regional Road 71 (St. Davids Road) and Highway 58 at a complicated interchange as it descends the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, and enters St. Catharines. Twelve Mile Creek in St. Catharines Within St. Catharines, Highway 406 twists frequently, entering the Twelve Mile Creek valley south of a complicated interchange with Westchester Avenue and Geneva Street and curving west. Within the valley, the freeway features a lower design speed and reduced speed limit of . It passes beneath the high-level St. Paul Street bridge, crosses the creek and intersects Fourth Avenue. Exiting the creek valley, the freeway parallels Fourth Avenue for a , gradually curves to the north and ends to the north, merging with the QEW.  History  Planning for Highway 406 began in early 1959, when Minister of Highways Fred M. Cass presented the Ontario Roads and Streets report to the Ontario Legislative Assembly on March 16, outlining highways needs for the province over 20 years. One of the planned routes was a freeway to link Highway 3 in Port Colborne with the QEW, travelling alongside the Welland Canal. By 1961, route studies and planning were well underway. The future route was designated as Highway 406 despite construction not beginning until 1963; the first section, between Geneva Street and St. Davids Road, opened December 7, 1965. This was followed several years later by an extension south to Beaverdams Road, which opened November 21, 1969. During the early 1970s, the highway was extended south as a Super 2 to north of the Welland River, where it curved west along Merritt Road and became Highway 58. This extension, which included the Beaverdams Road interchange and a signalized intersection, was opened on June 30, 1971. Highway 406 once featured the only at-grade railway crossing of any 400-series highway. This section was not a proper freeway, but rather a Super two. This crossing was later eliminated and grade separated in 2014 when the route was finally upgraded to freeway standards. In 1977, construction began on the section of Highway 406 between Geneva Street and the QEW. This work included the construction of several large bridges over the widened ravine, a curving structure over Twelve Mile Creek, and the first single-point urban interchange (SPUI) in Ontario (the only other SPUI is located on Airport Parkway in Ottawa). The original design plans for Highway 406 called for this section to follow the creek valley the full distance to the QEW, interchanging with it east of Martindale Road. Instead, the alignment was moved west of the city. Realignments to several streets in St. Catharines were completed in advance of construction on overpasses, ramps and the bridges over Twelve Mile Creek; this work was finished in late 1983. Grading contracts were awarded in mid-1983 for the entire extension. Paving took place during the summer of 1984, and the route was opened to traffic in October 1984. Further work to extend the future southbound lanes Highway 406 to East Main Street in Welland began during the fall of 1987, including an eastward extension of Woodlawn Road. Construction of the bridges that carry the extension over the Welland River and old canal began in mid-1988, and was completed during the fall of 1989. Work then began to grade and pave the Woodlawn Road Extension to Highway 406 and Highway 406 between there and East Main Street. The extension was completed by the mid-1990s. = Expansion = The southern end of Highway 406 in Welland Highway 406 was the last 400-series highway that featured at-grade intersections and two lane sections. The original intention was to twin this two-lane section shortly after it was constructed in the 1970s. Plans were deferred multiple times, until the project resumed in the early 2000s. The first phase of this twinning opened to traffic in 2007, extending the four- lane highway from its previous convergence south of Beaverdams Road to a point north of Port Robinson Road. On May 15 2009, Minister of Transportation Jim Bradley announced that the section from Port Robinson road to East Main Street in Welland would be converted to a full freeway; this work included a roundabout at East Main Street to replace the existing signalized intersection. Work on the Merritt Road overpass began in September 2009, and was scheduled for completion in mid-2011. On August 19, 2011, full construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony. The roundabout with East Main Street opened to traffic on September 5, 2013, featuring no central island. By September 2015, all the at-grade intersections had been removed and the 406 was a minimum four-lane, controlled-access freeway for its entire length. Despite requests from local politicians, there are no plans to extend Highway 406 to Port Colborne at this time.

His career began during World War I, and spanned the period in which military aviation developed from a minor arm of the Army Signal Corps to the huge Army Air Forces on the verge of becoming a separate service. Maughan became a pursuit pilot and served in combat in France in 1918 with the United States Army Air Service. Following the war, he remained in the Air Service and became a test pilot. In 1924 Maughan completed the first flight across the continental United States within the hours of daylight of a single calendar day. Biography Maughan was born March 28, 1893 in Logan, Utah, to Peter W. and Mary (n√©e Naef) Maughan. He graduated from Utah State Agricultural College in June 1917. The United States had entered World War I and Maughan enlisted as an Army aviation cadet. Commissioned a first lieutenant in the Signal Officer Reserve Corps after flight training and rated a Reserve Military Aviator, he served in France with the 139th Aero Squadron, where he flew a Spad XIII. Maughan was credited with four aerial victories and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on October 27, 1918, the citation for which is given below. He remained in the Air Service following the end of the war and was assigned to its Engineering Division at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, as a test pilot. Besides testing new designs, his responsibilities including public demonstrations of military aircraft and participation in air races. The Engineering Division had drawn the interest of Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell, Assistant Chief of the Air Service, who saw in it the opportunity for promoting the concept of an Air Force independent of the Army. On July 1, 1920, when the Air Service became a combat arm of the Army, Maughan received a Regular commission as a 1st lieutenant, Air Service. He transferred to Crissy Field at the Presidio of San Francisco in 1921 and joined the 91st Observation Squadron, then engaged in aerial forest fire patrol. In 1922 the National Air Races were held at Selfridge Field, Michigan, where the Air Service entered the Pulitzer Trophy Race with ten aircraft it had solicited from various manufacturers for use as possible pursuit planes, with specification that they be capable of reaching a speed of or greater. Flying a Curtiss R-6 racer, a precursor of the PW-8 design, Maughan won the Pulitzer race with an average speed of , on October 14, 1922. On October 16, flying the 1-kilometer course, he averaged for eight circuits, for four, and reached on one. This established a new international record, but it was not observed by F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) officials and was not officially recognized. Lt. Russell L. Manghan telling Chief of Air Service Mason Patrick and Secretary of War John W. Weeks about his successful \\"dawn to dusk\\" flight. The following year Maughan officially set a new international speed record of . He also made two attempts in July to fly coast-to-coast in a single day, using the new Curtiss PW-8, but mechanical problems thwarted both flights. On June 23, 1924, his third attempt succeeded, the first Dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the United States. The flight was made in six legs, with an actual flying time of 18 hours and 20 minutes, at an average ground speed of more than 156 mph. In 1928 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the flight. Maughan served in the Philippines from 1930 to 1935, with duty as Secretary of Aviation and Consultant to the Philippine Cabinet from 1930 to 1932. In 1939 he surveyed and selected airfields in Greenland and Iceland for aircraft ferry routes to Britain. Maughan, promoted to lieutenant colonel, commanded the 60th Transport Group, Pope Field, North Carolina, from July 28, 1941 to April 15, 1942. Promoted again to colonel, he was advanced to command of the 51st Troop Carrier Wing from June 1, 1942 to October 20, 1942, which included its deployment to England. Colonel Maughan retired in 1946, and died April 21, 1958, at San Antonio, Texas during surgery. He is buried in the Logan City Cemetery near the Utah State University campus in Logan, Utah.

By 1 May 1698 all \\"popish archbishops, bishops, vicars general, deans, jesuits, monks, friars, and other regular popish clergy\\" had to be in one of several named ports awaiting a ship out of the country. Remaining or entering the country after this date would be punished as a first offence with 12 months' imprisonment followed by expulsion. A second offence constituted high treason. The act was one of the Penal Laws passed after the Williamite War to safeguard the Church of Ireland as the established church and from fears of Catholic clerical support for Jacobitism. It was foreshadowed by proclamations issued by the Dublin Castle administration in 1673 and 1678 with similar terms.Connolly 2008 p.199 The banishment was originally and most effectively applied to regular clergy; many of whom registered (under the Registration Act 1704) as parish priests to be treated as secular clergy and avoid deportation. The ban on bishops may have been intended to prevent ordination of new priests, which, coupled with a ban on clerical immigration would lead to their eventual extinction.Connolly 2008 p.203 Of the eight Catholic bishops in Ireland when the act was passed, two left, one (John Sleyne) was arrested, and five went into hiding. The port authorities paid for the passage of 424 clerics who emigrated; Mary of Modena estimated that about 700 in total left, of whom 400 settled in France. Priest hunters were active in subsequent decades. Maurice Donnellan, Bishop of Clonfert, was arrested in 1703 but rescued by an armed crowd. Amendment and repeal The act was gradually less stringently enforced as the eighteenth century progressed.Connolly 2008 p.262 The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1782 provided that its provisions could not apply to a priest who had registered and taken the oath of supremacy.

The company was founded in 1906 and opened its mainline between Dothan, Alabama and Panama City, Florida in 1908. Later reclassified as a short-line railroad, its assets were acquired by the Bay Line Railroad in 1994.  History  As with many railroads in the region, the A&SAB; began in the minds of timber investors and land developers seeking to access the agricultural resources of the Florida Panhandle and South Alabama. Chief among them was A. B. Steele, who created the railroad to build south out of Dothan towards the Gulf Coast. The company incorporated on February 14, 1906 and opened its line between Dothan and Panama City on July 15, 1908. Panama City was incorporated the following year at the terminus of the line. Plans were soon made to extend the railroad north to Atlanta, however financial difficulties and pressure from the Central of Georgia railroad put an end to any plans for extension. World War II brought about a considerable increase in traffic on the A&SAB.; Several military bases in the vicinity of Panama City ensured the Bay Line would remain a hotbed of activity for the duration of the war. Shortly after the war in 1947, the A&SAB; was granted Class I status. The company offered sleeper and coach passenger train service nightly between Panama City and Atlanta Union Station via Albany and Macon until the 1950s. The trains went over Central of Georgia Railway tracks from Dothan, Alabama to Atlanta.'Official Guide,' August 1949, 668'Official Guide,' December 1954, 670 TOFC service began in 1962 with the construction of ramps at Panama City and Cottondale. Additional expansion came with the construction of a branch line to Graceville in 1971. In 1979 International Paper sold the railroad to Southwest Forest Industries, and the railroad changed hands again with the sale of Southwest Forest Industries to the Stone Container Corporation in 1987. In 1989, Stone Container Corporation purchased from CSX Transportation a branch line from Grimes to Abbeville, Alabama. The new railroad, the Abbeville-Grimes Railway Company, was operated by the A&SAB.; On January 1, 1994, the Rail Management Corporation acquired the assets of the railroad and created a new company, the Bay Line Railroad, to operate it. =Graceville branch= Construction of the branch spanning from Campbellton, Florida to Graceville was completed on July 14, 1971. Graceville was located at the terminus of the Georgiana branch of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. This allowed for interchange between the two railroads and access to a Southwest Forest Industries woodchip mill located in Graceville that supplied the Panama City paper mill. In addition to the woodchip mill, Gold Kist operated a peanut mill in Graceville. The Seaboard System Railroad, successor to the Louisville and Nashville, abandoned the line into Graceville on January 16, 1984. The A&SAB; purchased the small yard and wye track in Graceville from the vacating Seaboard and continued serving the city. Declining traffic prompted the abandonment of the branch by the mid 1990s. =Abbeville branch= Stone Container Corporation purchased the line between Grimes and Abbeville on March 1, 1989. The primary source of traffic is a woodchip mill near Abbeville, which provides woodchips for the Panama City paper mill. The Bay Line accessed the Abbeville & Grimes branch via trackage rights with CSX between Grimes and Dothan. The Abbeville branch was included in the sale to the Bay Line Railroad. The A&G; was formally merged into the Bay Line on June 26, 1996.

The act was one of a series of Penal Laws passed after the Williamite War to protect the victorious Protestant Ascendancy from a church seen as loyal to the defeated Jacobites and to foreign powers. Its second section stated that if an Irish Catholic priest was to convert to the established Church of Ireland, he would receive a 20-pound stipend, levied on the residents of the area where he had last practised. Unregistered clergy were to depart Ireland before the 20 July 1704 and any remaining after 24 June 1705 would be deported.

The law enforced Irish farm subdivision as a rule of inheritance. Although the law established a different inheritance rule for Roman Catholics, compared to Protestants, it did so, superficially at least, on reasonable grounds. Traditional Irish law used Gavelkind as the inheritance rule - in which an estate would be divided equally among a dead man's sons; by contrast, England had come to use male primogeniture as the main inheritance principle - with the eldest son receiving the entire estate. The Gavelkind Act, simply enforced the traditional Irish law on Roman Catholics, and the English law on Protestants. However, if the eldest son of a Roman Catholic family converted to the Protestant faith, he would no longer have to share his father's estate with his siblings (by Gavelkind), but could instead keep all of it for himself (by primogeniture). Thus the law had the effect of reducing the size - and influence - of Roman Catholic landed estates; this was that Act's ulterior motive Its citation is 2 Ann c.6. Catholic land holdings: *1688: 25% of land *1704: 14% of land *1776: 5% of land Sir Toby Butler, the former Solicitor General for Ireland, a Roman Catholic, made a celebrated speech at the bar of the Irish House of Commons denouncing the Act as being \\"against the laws of God and man...against the rules of reason and justice\\". Other eminent Catholic lawyers like Stephen Rice also denounced the measure, but to no avail. Section XVII required any person with a civil or military office to subscribe to a declaration on transubstantiation and take an oath of abjuration, and also receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the usage of the Church of Ireland within three months. As well as excluding Roman Catholics from office, the final requirement excluded non-conformist Protestants, notably Presbyterians, and many had to step down from municipal corporations and other positions.

History  Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1899, Samuel M. Pinsly received degrees in engineering and law from Northwestern University before briefly serving in the U.S. Army during World War I. Pinsly founded his shortline operating company in 1938 with the purchase of the Hoosac Tunnel and Wilmington Railroad from his father-in-law, fellow shortline operator H.E. Salzberg. While the line was rebuilt and turned a profit, extensive line relocations due to a new dam forced the railroad to be abandoned in 1971.

It is a notable feat of civil engineering, having been called an \\"engineering masterpiece.\\" The Institute of Professional Engineers of New Zealand has designated the spiral as a significant engineering heritage site.IPENZ View of the spiral from helicopter Raurimu railway station  Background  During the construction of the central section of the NIMT, a major obstacle arose: how to cross the steep slopes between the North Island Volcanic Plateau to the east and the valleys and gorges of the Whanganui River to the west? Map of the spiral, from OpenStreetMap South of Taumarunui, the terrain is steep but not unmanageable, with the exception of the stretch between Raurimu and National Park, where the land rises too steeply for a direct rail route. A direct line between these two points would rise in a distance of some , a gradient of 1 in 24. The area was thoroughly surveyed during the 1880s in an attempt to find a route with a lesser grade, but the only viable possibility seemed to require a detour and nine massive viaducts. Even then, the gradient would have been over 1 in 50.  Construction  The problem was solved in 1898 by a surveyor in the employ of Robert Holmes, Public Works Department engineer. He proposed a line that looped back upon itself and then spiralled around with the aid of tunnels and bridges, rising at a gradient of 1 in 52. Though costly and labour-intensive, the scheme was still cheaper than the previous plan by Browne and Turner which required 9 viaducts down the Piopiotea River. The most remarkable feature is that even today there is no place to view the complete line. By all accounts, Holmes visualised the layout in his imagination. The railway forms an ascending spiral southwards, with two relatively short tunnels, a circle and three hairpin bends. From the north, trains pass Raurimu before going round a 200¬∞ bend to the left in a horseshoe curve, climbing above the track on which they have just travelled. Two sharp bends to the right follow, after which the line passes through two short tunnels, the Lower Spiral Tunnel (384 m) and the Upper Spiral Tunnel (96 m). Trains then complete a full circle, crossing over the Lower Spiral Tunnel through which they have just passed which is below, before continuing towards Wellington. further on the line has two further sharp bends, to the right and then to the left. After the second of these bends a train has risen and travelled from Raurimu‚Äì the straight-line distance is . Some of the sharp curves are only 7¬Ω chains (150 m) radius. Although spirals are relatively common in the Alps, particularly in Switzerland, they generally involve extensive tunnelling inside mountainsides. A masterly feature of Holmes' layout is the way in which it uses natural land contours to almost eliminate tunnels and viaducts, having only two short tunnels. Legend has it that a locomotive engineer once put on the emergency brakes of his train in the night upon mistaking the light of his Guard's Van on a nearby part of the spiral as the rear of a different train directly ahead of him.

Industry and governments across the globe are investing in unconventional oil sources due to the increasing scarcity of conventional oil reserves. Unconventional oil and gas have already made a dent in international energy linkages by reducing US energy import dependency. Sources According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2001 unconventional oil included \\"oil shales, oil sands- based synthetic crudes and derivative products, (heavy oil, Orimulsion¬Æ), coal-based liquid supplies, biomass-based liquid supplies, gas to liquid (GTL) - liquids arising from chemical processing of gas.\\" In the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2011 report, \\"[u]nconventional oil include[d] extra-heavy oil, natural bitumen (oil sands), kerogen oil, liquids and gases arising from chemical processing of natural gas (GTL), coal-to-liquids (CTL) and additives.\\"  Definition  In their 2013 webpage jointly published with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the IEA observed that as technologies and economies change, definitions for unconventional and conventional oils also change. According to the US Department of Energy (DOE), \\"unconventional oils have yet to be strictly defined.\\" In a communication to the UK entitled Oil Sands Crude in the series The Global Range of Crude Oils, it was argued that commonly used definitions of unconventional oil based on production techniques are imprecise and time-dependent. They noted that the International Energy Agency does not recognize any universally accepted definition for \\"conventional\\" or \\"unconventional\\" oil. Extraction techniques that are categorized as \\"conventional\\" use \\"unconventional means\\" such as gas re-injection or the use of heat\\" not traditional oil extraction methods. As the use of newer technologies increase, \\"unconventional\\" oil recovery has become the norm not the exception. They noted that the Canadian oil sands production \\"pre-dates oil production from areas such as the North Sea (the source of a benchmark crude oil known as \\"Brent\\"). Under revised definitions, petroleum products, such as Western Canadian Select, a heavy crude benchmark blend produced in Hardisty, Alberta may migrate from its categorization as unconventional oil to conventional oil because of its density, even though the oil sands are an unconventional resource. =Oil sands= Oil sands generally consist of extra heavy crude oil or crude bitumen trapped in unconsolidated sandstone. These hydrocarbons are forms of crude oil that are extremely dense and viscous, with a consistency ranging from that of molasses for some extra- heavy oil to as solid as peanut butter for some bitumen at room temperature, making extraction difficult. These heavy crude oils have a density (specific gravity) approaching or even exceeding that of water. As a result of their high viscosity, they cannot be produced by conventional methods, transported without heating or dilution with lighter hydrocarbons, or refined by older oil refineries without major modifications. Such heavy crude oils often contain high concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals, particularly nickel and vanadium, which interfere with refining processes, although lighter crude oils can also suffer from sulfur and heavy metal contamination. These properties present significant environmental challenges to the growth of heavy oil production and use. Canada's Athabasca oil sands and Venezuela's Orinoco heavy oil belt are the best known example of this kind of unconventional reserve. In 2003 the estimated reserves were . Heavy oil sands and bituminous sands occur worldwide. The two most important deposits are the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta, Canada and the Orinoco heavy oil belt in Venezuela. The hydrocarbon content of these deposits is either crude bitumen or extra-heavy crude oil, the former of which is often upgraded to synthetic crude (syncrude) and the latter of which the Venezuelan fuel Orimulsion is based. The Venezuelan extra heavy oil deposits differ from the Canadian bituminous sands in that they flow more readily at Venezuela's higher reservoir temperatures and could be produced by conventional techniques, but the recovery rates would be less than the unconventional Canadian techniques (about 8% versus up to 90% for surface mining and 60% for steam assisted gravity drainage). In 2011, Alberta's total proven oil reserves were 170.2 billion barrels representing 11 percent of the total global oil reserves (1,523 billion barrels) and 99% of Canada's oil reserves. By 2011 Alberta was supplying 15% of the United States crude oil imports, exporting about of crude oil. The 2006 projections for 2015, were about . At that rate, the Athabasca oil sands reserves would last less than 160 years. About 80 percent of Alberta's bituminous deposits can be extracted using in-situ methods such as steam assisted gravity drainage and 20 percent by surface mining methods. The Northern Alberta oil sands in Athabasca, Cold Lake and Peace River areas contain an estimated 2 trillion barrels (initial volume in place) of crude bitumen and extra-heavy oil of which 9 percent was considered recoverable using technology available in 2013. It is estimated by oil companies that the Athabasca and Orinoco sites (both of similar size) have as much as two-thirds of total global oil deposits. They have only recently been considered proven reserves of oil. This is because oil prices have risen since 2003 and costs to extract oil from these mines have fallen. Between 2003 and 2008, world oil prices rose to over $140, and costs to extract the oil fell to less than $15 per barrel at the Suncor and Syncrude mines. In 2013, crude oil from the Canadian oil sands was expensive oil to produce, although new US tight oil production was similarly expensive. Supply costs for Athabasca oil sands projects were approximately US$50 to US$90 per barrel. However, costs for Bakken, Eagle Ford and Niobrara were higher at approximately US$70 to US$90, according to 135 global oil and gas companies surveyed reported by the Financial Post. Extracting a significant percentage of world oil production from these deposits will be difficult since the extraction process takes a great deal of capital, human power and land. Another constraint is energy for project heat and electricity generation, currently coming from natural gas, which in recent years has seen a surge in production and a corresponding drop in price in North America. With the new supply of shale gas in North America, the need for alternatives to natural gas has been greatly diminished. A 2009 study by CERA estimated that production from Canada's oil sands emits \\"about 5‚Äì15% more carbon dioxide, over the \\"well-to-wheels\\" lifetime analysis of the fuel, than average crude oil.\\" Author and investigative journalist David Strahan that same year stated that IEA figures show that carbon dioxide emissions from the tar sands are 20% higher than average emissions from oil.Who‚Äôs afraid of the tar sands? =Tight oil= Tight oil, including light tight oil (sometimes confusingly the term 'shale oil' is used instead of 'light tight oil') is crude oil contained in petroleum-bearing formations of low permeability, often shale or tight sandstone. Economic production from tight oil formations requires the same hydraulic fracturing and often uses the same horizontal well technology used in the production of shale gas. It should not be confused with oil shale, which is shale rich in kerogen, or shale oil, which is synthetic oil produced from oil shales. Therefore, the International Energy Agency recommends to use the term \\"light tight oil\\" for oil produced from shales or other very low permeability formations, while World Energy Resources 2013 report by the World Energy Council uses the term \\"tight oil\\". =Oil shale= Oil shale is an organic-rich fine-grained sedimentary rock containing significant amounts of kerogen (a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds) from which technology can extract liquid hydrocarbons (shale oil) and combustible oil shale gas. The kerogen in oil shale can be converted to shale oil through the chemical processes of pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution.Luik, Alternative Technologies The temperature when perceptible decomposition of oil shale occurs depends on the time-scale of the pyrolysis; in the above ground retorting process the perceptible decomposition occurs at , but proceeds more rapidly and completely at higher temperatures. The rate of decomposition is the highest at a temperature of to . The ratio of shale gas to shale oil depends on the retorting temperature and as a rule increases with the rise of temperature.Koel, Estonian oil shale For the modern in-situ process, which might take several months of heating, decomposition may be conducted as low as . Depending on the exact properties of oil shale and the exact processing technology, the retorting process may be water and energy extensives. Oil shale has also been burnt directly as a low-grade fuel.World Energy Council, Survey, pp. 93‚Äì115.Dyni, Geology and resources A 2016 estimate by the World Energy Council set total world shale oil resources at 6.05 trillion barrels. The United States is believed to hold more than 80% of that total. There are around 600 known oil shale deposits around the world, including major deposits in the United States of America. Although oil shale deposits occur in many countries, only 33 countries possess known deposits of possible economic value.Brendow, Global oil shale issues and perspectives, pp. 81‚Äì92.Qian, Wand and Li, \\"Oil Shale Development in China\\", pp. 356‚Äì359 The largest deposits in the world occur in the United States in the Green River Formation, which covers portions of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. Approximately 70% of this resource lies on land owned or managed by the United States federal government. Well-explored deposits, potentially possessing additional economic value, include the Green River deposits in the western United States, the Tertiary deposits in Queensland, Australia, deposits in Sweden and Estonia, the El-Lajjun deposit in Jordan, and deposits in France, Germany, Brazil, Morocco, China, southern Mongolia and Russia. These deposits have given rise to expectations of yielding at least of shale oil per tonne of shale, using the Fischer Assay method.Altun et al., \\"Oil Shales in the world and Turkey\\", pp. 211‚Äì227. According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation, the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, retorting plant, upgrading plant, supporting utilities, and spent shale reclamation), would range between US$70‚Äì95 ($440‚Äì600/m3, adjusted to 2005 values). , industry uses oil shale for shale oil production in Brazil, China and Estonia. Several additional countries started assessing their reserves or had built experimental production plants. In the US, if oil shale could be used to meet a quarter of the current demand, of recoverable resources would last for more than 400 years.Bartis et al., Oil Shale Development in the United States =Thermal depolymerization= Thermal depolymerization (TDP) has the potential to recover energy from existing sources of waste such as petroleum coke as well as pre-existing waste deposits. This process, which imitates those that occur in nature, uses heat and pressure to break down organic and inorganic compounds through a method known as hydrous pyrolysis. Because energy output varies greatly based on feedstock, it is difficult to estimate potential energy production. According to Changing World Technologies, Inc., this process even has the ability to break down several types of materials, many of which are poisonous to both humans and the environment. =Coal and gas conversion= Using synthetic fuel processes, the conversion of coal and natural gas has the potential to yield great quantities of unconventional oil and/or refined products, albeit at much lower net energy output than the historic average for conventional oil extraction. In its day - prior to the drilling of oilwells to tap reservoirs of crude oil- the pyrolysis of mined solid organic-rich deposits was the conventional method of producing mineral oils. Historically, petroleum was already being produced on an industrial scale in the United Kingdom and the United States by dry distillation of cannel coal or oil shale in the first half of the 19th Century. Yields of oil from simple pyrolysis, however, are limited by the composition of the material being pyrolysed, and modern 'oil- from-coal' processes aim for a much higher yield of organic liquids, brought about by chemical reaction with the solid feedstuff. The four primary conversion technologies used for the production of unconventional oil and refined products from coal and gas are the indirect conversion processes of the Fischer-Tropsch process and the Mobil Process (also known as Methanol to Gasoline), and the direct conversion processes of the Bergius process and the Karrick process. Sasol has run a coal-to-liquids plant based on Fischer Tropsch conversion in South Africa since the 1970s. Because of the high cost of transporting natural gas, many known but remote fields were not being developed. On-site conversion to liquid fuels are making this energy available under present market conditions. Fischer Tropsch fuels plants converting natural gas to fuel, a process broadly known as gas-to-liquids are operating in Malaysia, South Africa, and Qatar. Large direct conversion coal to liquids plants are currently under construction, or undergoing start-up in China. Total global synthetic fuel production capacity exceeds , and is expected to grow rapidly in coming years, with multiple new plants currently under construction. Environmental concerns As with all forms of mining, there are hazardous tailings and waste generated from the varied processes of oil extraction and production.US Environmental Protection Agency, \\"Special Wastes\\" Environmental concerns with heavy oils are similar to those with lighter oils. However, they provide additional concerns, such as the need to heat heavy oils to pump them out of the ground. Extraction also requires large volumes of water. The environmental impacts of oil shale differ depending on the type of extraction; however, there are some common trends. The mining process releases carbon dioxide, in addition to other oxides and pollutants, as the shale is heated. Furthermore, there is some concern about some of the chemicals mixing with ground water (either as runoff or through seeping). There are processes either in use or under development to help mitigate some of these environmental concerns. The conversion of coal or natural gas into oil generates large amounts of carbon dioxide in addition to all the impacts of gaining these resources to begin with. However, placing plants in key areas can reduce the effective emissions due to pumping the carbon dioxide into oil beds or coal beds to enhance the recovery of oil and methane. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, so the increased carbon dioxide produced from both the more involved extraction process with unconventional oil, as well as burning the oil itself, has led to deep concerns about unconventional oil worsening the impacts of climate change. Economics Sources of unconventional oil will be increasingly relied upon when conventional oil becomes more expensive due to depletion. Conventional oil sources are currently preferred because they are less expensive than unconventional sources. New technologies, such as steam injection for oil sands deposits, are being developed to reduce unconventional oil production costs. In May 2013 the IEA in its Medium-Term Oil Market Report (MTOMR) said that the North American oil production surge led by unconventional oils - US light, tight oil (LTO) and Canadian oil sands - had produced a global supply shock that would reshape the way oil is transported, stored, refined and marketed.

It also acts as a liaison between artists and the record label or publishing company; every activity involving artists to the point of album release is generally considered under the purview, and responsibility, of A&R.; Responsibilities =Finding talent= The A&R; division of a record label is responsible for finding new recording artists and bringing those artists to the record company. A&R; staff may go to hear emerging bands play at nightclubs and festivals to scout for talent. Personnel in the A&R; division are expected to understand the current tastes of the market and to be able to find artists that will be commercially successful. For this reason, A&R; people are often young and many are musicians, music journalists or record producers. An A&R; executive is authorized to offer a record contract, often in the form of a \\"deal memo\\": a short informal document that establishes a business relationship between the recording artist and the record company. The actual contract negotiations will typically be carried out by rival entertainment lawyers hired by the musician's manager and the record company. A&R; executives rely mostly on the word of mouth of trusted associates, critics and business contacts, rather than on unsolicited demo tapes. They also tend to favor the bands that play in the same city as the record label's offices. =Overseeing the recording process= The A&R; division of a record label oversees the music style and recording process. This includes helping the artist to find the right record producer, scheduling time in a recording studio and advising the artist on all aspects of making a high-quality recording. They work with the artist to choose the best songs (i.e., repertoire) to record. For artists who do not write their own music, the A&R; person will assist in finding songs, songwriters, and arrangers. A&R; staff will help find session musicians for the recording. A&R; executives maintain contact with their counterparts at music publishing companies to get new songs and material from songwriters and producers. As the record nears completion, the A&R; department works closely with the artist to determine whether the record is acceptable to the record company. This process may include suggesting that new songs need to be written, that existing songs need a new arrangement, or that some album tracks need to be re-recorded. A key issue is whether the album has a single: a particular track which can be used to market the record on radio, television, or streaming media, and which has potential to become popular. =Assisting with marketing and promotion= Once the record is completed, the A&R; department consults with marketing, promotion, the artist and their management to choose one or more singles to help promote the record. History and influence The tastes of particular A&R; executives have influenced the course of music history. A&R; man John H. Hammond discovered Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin and Bruce Springsteen. Hammond's colleagues were initially skeptical of these artists because none of them appeared to be creating \\"commercial\\" music. Hammond's instincts proved to be correct, and these artists went on to sell hundreds of millions of records. George Daly, Hammond's colleague at Columbia Records, proved the same instinct with bands as varied as outliers as The Tubes and Tool during his career. Gary Gersh signed the band Nirvana to David Geffen's DGC Records at a time when alternative rock music was not considered commercial. Gersh was able to convince his co-workers to push the record in spite of their misgivings. In cases like these, A&R; people have radically changed the direction of popular musical tastes and introduced large numbers of people to new sounds. This kind of prescience is, however, the exception rather than the rule. Historically, A&R; executives have tended to sign new artists that fit into recent trends and who resemble acts that are currently successful. For example, Columbia Records' A&R; man in the 1950s, Mitch Miller, favored traditional pop singers like Guy Mitchell and Patti Page, and rejected early rock-'n'-rollers Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly. This \\"trend following\\" mindset has generated several waves of narrowly defined genres, leading to a perception of triteness, including teen pop (1998‚Äì2001), alternative rock (1993‚Äì1996), glam metal (1986‚Äì1991) and disco (1976‚Äì1978). Trend following can be counter-productive, since it has often led to over- promotion followed by backlash (as happened to the disco genre for example). Towards the end of the life of each wave or trend, record companies have found themselves faced with enormous losses, as consumers' tastes changed. For example, at the end of the disco boom in 1978, millions of records were returned by record retailers, causing a deep recession in the music business that lasted until 1982, when Michael Jackson's Thriller finally brought the public back into record stores in large numbers.Disco boom: . Teen pop boom: . Knopper discusses the way the industry has overreacted to these waves throughout his book. The general move towards more conservative and business- minded signings from the 1980s onwards is seen to be symptomatic of an industry where the most powerful figures are no longer music fans or people with musical backgrounds but business executives, a group largely composed of individuals with uniform backgrounds. Traditionally A&R; executives were composers, arrangers and producers ‚Äì Atlantic Records's heads Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun were producers and composers respectively ‚Äì but an A&R; with musical ability and knowledge has become a rarity, with Ron Fair and Martin Kierszenbaum being notable recent exceptions. The composer and arranger Richard Niles has said, > What you've got now is huge multinational companies where most of their A&R; > staff are businessmen. They‚Äôre people who look at music from the standpoint > of marketing, not from the standpoint of music and talent. They will say, > \\"Go out and get me anything that's popular now.\\" Hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan referenced this stereotype of the business-minded A&R; executive in their single \\"Protect Ya Neck\\", metaphorically likening them to \\"mountain climbers\\". Regional variations According to Rhythm King Records and Lizard King Records founder Martin Heath, the A&R; community in the UK is more integrated than it is in the US, being very London-centric and encompassing a relatively small number of people. \\"If scouts are chasing a band, you‚Äôll see the same thirty people in one room. You get a herd mentality in the UK, but also some very diverse signings as well,\\" he said in an interview with HitQuarters. Heath believes that in the USA it is more typical for A&R; to wait until a band is established ‚Äì having attracted other offers or achieved a level of sales ‚Äì before taking action, a technique which often works out as being more expensive. 2000s changes New forms of digital distribution have changed the relationship between consumers and the music they choose. Gerd Leonhard and others argue that the wide selection of music on digital services has allowed music consumers to bypass the traditional role of A&R.; In the wake of declining record sales, many A&R; staffers have been terminated. It is unclear whether A&R; executives will shape the future of musical tastes as they have in the past.

Ceratosaurs are believed to have diverged from the rest of Theropoda by the early Jurassic, however, the oldest confirmed discovered specimens date to the Late Jurassic. According to the majority of the latest research, Ceratosauria includes the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous theropods Ceratosaurus, Elaphrosaurus, and Abelisaurus, found primarily (though not exclusively) in the Southern Hemisphere. Originally, Ceratosauria included the above dinosaurs plus the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic Coelophysoidea and Dilophosauridae, implying a much earlier divergence of ceratosaurs from other theropods. However, most recent studies have shown that coelophysoids and dilophosaurids do not form a natural group with other ceratosaurs, and are excluded from this group. Ceratosauria derives its names from the type species, Ceratosaurus nasicornis, described by O.C. Marsh in 1884. A moderately large predator from the Late Jurassic, Ceratosaurus nasicornis, was the first ceratosaur to be discovered. Ceratosaurs are generally moderately large in size, with some exceptions like the larger Carnotaurus and the significantly smaller noasaurs. The major defining characteristics of Ceratosauria include a robust skull with increased ornamentation or height and a shortening of the arms. Both of these characteristics are generally accentuated in later members of the group, such as the abelisaurs, whereas more basal species such as C. nasicornis appear more similar to other basal theropods. The highly fragmented nature of the ceratosaur fossil record means that the characteristics, relationships, and early history of Ceratosauria remain mysterious and highly debated.  Phylogeny  = Historical Phylogeny = Ceratosauria was first described by O.C. Marsh in the American Journal of Science in 1884. Writing about the newly discovered C. nasicornis, he noted the similarities between the firmly united metatarsals of C. nasicornis and those of Archaeopteryx. Since C. nasicornis was the only other dinosaur discovered at the time to share this trait, Marsh concluded that Ceratosauria must be placed very near Archaeopteryx and its related groups. However, the idea of the Ceratosauria was soon contested by Marsh's rival, Edward Drinker Cope. Cope argued that the taxon was invalid. The idea of the Ceratosauria would regain some support more than thirty years later when Gilmore argued in its favor in 1920. Despite Gilmore's support, few species were added to the group following World War I, and little emphasis was placed on it. In fact, the scientific communities most common interaction with Ceratosauria throughout much of the 20th century was the disputation of its existence, performed by the likes of Romer, Lapparent, Lavocat, Colbert, and Charig amongst others. Ceratosauria's fortune changed in 1986 when Jacques Gauthier, in an attempt to clarify the evolution of birds, grouped the majority of theropods into either Ceratosauria or Tetanurae. In Ceratosauria, he placed the ceratosaurs and coelophysoids. Gauthier's paper brought Ceratosauria's use back in vogue, and by the early 1990s, Abelisaridae had also been included under Ceratosauria. The triumvirate model of ceratosaurs, coelophysoids, and abelisaurids would go unchallenged until the early 2000s. Beginning at the turn of the millennium, a large number of paleontologists began excluding coelophysoids from Ceratosauria. This view is now widely held thanks to several similarities between Ceratosauria and Tetanurae not found in coelophysoids. = Current Phylogeny = Most paleontologists have postulated that Ceratosauria split off from other theropods in the late Triassic or early Jurassic. Despite this, no ceratosaurs have been discovered prior the middle Jurassic, and even in the middle Jurassic, species are sparse. Many scientists, such as Carrano and Sampson, have postulated the lack of specimens is due to a poor fossil record, rather than an indictment on the abundance of ceratosaurs at the time. A similarly large gap of specimens exist in the lower Cretaceous, particularly for Abelisaridae. Several recent discoveries of possible ceratosaurs have begun reshaping the phylogeny of Ceratosauria by filling in some of these gaps. Specifically, this has allowed paleontologists to begin altering the sub-groups inside Ceratosauria, in an attempt to find their most basal members. Currently, most paleontologists agree that Ceratosauria divides into two sub groups, Ceratosauridae and Abelisauroidea, with some variance as to which taxa are placed into basal polotomy. Abelisauroidea is further divided into the Abelisauridae and Noasauridae, with Abelisauridae, including Carnotaurinae. Recently, Rauhut and Carrano have placed Elaphrosaurinae inside Noasauridae while simultaneously moving the previous noasaurs into Noasaurinae. Into their new Noasauridae, they have uniquely included Deltadromeus and Limusaurus. The oldest known ceratosaur currently described is Berberosaurus liassicus at 185 Ma. Some paleontologists believe that Berberosaurus liassicus, is the most basal ceratosaur currently discovered as well. The placement of B. liassicus has been a topic for debate, with some considering it an abelisaur, while others classifying as a basal polotomy. The following cladogram follows an analysis by Diego Pol and Oliver W. M. Rauhut, 2012. A different conclusion was reached in a 2017 paper on Limusaurus ontogeny. The phylogenetics from the analysis with composite Limusaurus codings is shown below. Unlike other analyses, Noasauridae was placed more basal than Ceratosaurus, with the latter being within Abelisauridae by definition.  Paleobiology  = Anatomy = Some of the defining characteristics of Ceratosauria include an increase in height and ornamentation of the skull, as well as a shortening of the forelimbs. Likewise, ceratosaurs fused their ilium, ischium, and pubis together, as well as the astralagus and calcaneum. For less derived members of the group, such as C. nasicornis, traits such as raising of the skull and shortening of the forelimbs were not as noticeable. The skull of C. nasicornis was rather similar to the basal theropod mold, with a distinguishing nasal crest to go along with lacrimal crests similar to the contemporary Allosaurus. C. nasicornis had larger teeth than Allosaurus, and some paleontologists postulate that it would have had a difficult time attacking larger prey. Abelisaurids, however, carried many of these defining traits to their extremes. Most abelisaurids had largely shortened forelimbs, with Carnotaurus having shrunk them further than any large theropod. After analyzing the features of the newly discovered Rugops primus, Paul Sereno has postulated that many of these abelisaurid features may lend themselves to scavenging. Despite the huge reduction in size, no taxa in Ceratosauria ever lost a digit or any critical elements of the forelimb. Some joint variation has also been observed in Ceratosauria, and it has been postulated that they may have had better shoulder mobility than other large theropods. = Geography = Ceratosaurs appeared to have had a global population that diverged by the early Jurassic. However, they appear to have largely disappeared from Laurasia in the Cretaceous, with those few specimens that have been discovered having been possibly reintroduced from Gondwana. No confirmed specimens of ceratosaurs in North America during the Cretaceous have been found. Abelisaurids in particular had great success in Gondwana, particularly in the Cretaceous. Some Gondwana specimens have recently been found and dated to Late Jurassic, and possibly even the Middle Jurassic, greatly extending the Abelisaurid timeline. Some paleontologists have postulated that a large desert may have kept abelisaurids locked in southern Gondwana until the late Jurassic. Whether correlation or causation, it has been largely observed that late Cretaceous ceratosaurs were found less in areas dominated by basal tetanurans (Africa) or coelosaurs (North America and Asia). The below phylogeny follows a simplified cladogram of Hendrickx et al. (2015), limited to Ceratosauria. = Diet = Ceratosaurs were theropods and thus carnivores, with one exception, Limusaurus inextricabilis was an herbivore with a toothless beak. Ceratosaurus has been argued to have eaten a large amount of fish and other aquatic creatures, though this has been disputed by many paleontologists. Tooth marks on large animals such as Allosaurus indicate that Ceratosaurus likely utilized scavenging often. The interesting jaws of the abelisaurids have drawn mixed dietary predictions. One study on Carnotaurus found that its bite, thanks to its shortened skull, was suited for hunting small prey, thanks to a quick, but relatively weak bite. On the other hand, other groups of paleontologists have found that the bite of Carnotaurus was relatively powerful, and more adept at hunting and wounding large prey. Others have postulated its skull was built for scavenging. The debate over the eating habits of ceratosaurs is quite active, particularly recently with the increase in abelisaur discoveries.

In an inelastic scattering process, some of the energy of the incident particle is lost or increased. Although the term is historically related to the concept of inelastic collision in dynamics, the two concepts are quite distinct; inelastic collision in dynamics refers to processes in which the total macroscopic kinetic energy is not conserved. In general, scattering due to inelastic collisions will be inelastic, but, since elastic collisions often transfer kinetic energy between particles, scattering due to elastic collisions can also be inelastic, as in Compton scattering. Electrons When an electron is the incident particle, the probability of inelastic scattering, depending on the energy of the incident electron, is usually smaller than that of elastic scattering. Thus in the case of gas electron diffraction (GED), reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), and transmission electron diffraction, because the energy of the incident electron is high, the contribution of inelastic electron scattering can be ignored. Deep inelastic scattering of electrons from protons provided the first direct evidence for the existence of quarks. Photons When a photon is the incident particle, there is an inelastic scattering process called Raman scattering. In this scattering process, the incident photon interacts with matter (gas, liquid, and solid) and the frequency of the photon is shifted towards red or blue. A red shift can be observed when part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the interacting matter, where it adds to its internal energy in a process called Stokes Raman scattering. The blue shift can be observed when internal energy of the matter is transferred to the photon; this process is called anti-Stokes Raman scattering. Inelastic scattering is seen in the interaction between an electron and a photon. When a high-energy photon collides with a free electron and transfers energy, the process is called Compton scattering. Furthermore, when an electron with relativistic energy collides with an infrared or visible photon, the electron gives energy to the photon. This process is called inverse Compton scattering. Neutrons Neutrons undergo many types of scattering, including both elastic and inelastic scattering. Whether elastic or inelastic scatter occurs is dependent on the speed of the neutron, whether fast or thermal, or somewhere in between. It is also dependent on the nucleus it strikes and its neutron cross section. In inelastic scattering, the neutron interacts with the nucleus and the kinetic energy of the system is changed. This often activates the nucleus, putting it into an excited, unstable, short-lived energy state which causes it to quickly emit some kind of radiation to bring it back down to a stable or ground state. Alpha, beta, gamma, and protons may be emitted. Particles scattered in this type of nuclear reaction may cause the nucleus to recoil in the other direction. Molecular collisions Inelastic scattering is common in molecular collisions. Any collision which leads to a chemical reaction will be inelastic, but the term inelastic scattering is reserved for those collisions which do not result in reactions. There is a transfer of energy between the translational mode (kinetic energy) and rotational and vibrational modes. If the transferred energy is small compared to the incident energy of the scattered particle, one speaks of quasielastic scattering.

Produced and distributed by Toho Studios, it is the 27th film in the Godzilla franchise and the fourth film in the franchise's Millennium period, and is also the 26th Godzilla film produced by Toho. The film features the fictional giant monster character Godzilla, along with an updated version of the mecha character Mechagodzilla, who is referred to in the film as Kiryu. The film stars Yumiko Shaku, Shin Takuma, Kou Takasugi, Yuusuke Tomoi, Kumi Mizuno, and Akira Nakao, with Tsutomu Kitagawa as Godzilla and Hirofumi Ishigaki as Kiryu. Like the previous films in the franchise's Millennium era, Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla is a reboot that ignores the events of every installment in the Godzilla film series aside from the original 1954 Godzilla, although Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla also acknowledges the events of both Mothra and The War of the Gargantuas. The film was followed by a direct sequel, Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S., the following year. Plot In 1999, 45 years after Godzilla's first attack in 1954, Lieutenant Akane Yashiro, a maser-cannon technician, is unable to kill a new member of Godzilla's species during her first fight. She accidentally knocks a vehicle down the mountain where it and its occupants are crushed by Godzilla and she is transferred to a desk job. During the battle, it was discovered that Godzilla is immune to maser fire, rendering all of the Japanese military useless against it. Scientists, including single father Tokumitsu Yuhara, are gathered to build a bio-mechanical robot from the original Godzilla's skeleton. The cyborg Mechagodzilla, named Kiryu, is finished and inducted into the Japan Self-Defense Forces along with its human pilots as the Kiryu Squadron. Akane becomes the main pilot for Kiryu. However, memories of Akane's actions during the original fight still linger, and one of her squadron mates, Second Lieutenant Susumu Hayama holds her responsible for the death of his brother (who was in the car she knocked down the mountain). Four years later, Mechagodzilla is shown to the world, and the complete system that controls the unit is explained. Controlled remotely from a control craft that resembles a very large jet fighter with V/STOL capabilities, it can be remotely recharged from the ground using microwaves that are relayed through a power system on one of the command aircraft, and then beamed back down to Kiryu. For the end of the presentation, its greatest and most powerful weapon, the freezing Absolute Zero Cannon, is shown. At the same time, Godzilla shows up once again, and Kiryu is launched into battle. In the midst of the first battle, Kiryu's soul is awoken by Godzilla's roar and brings with it the memories of the original Godzilla's death. As if it were the original Godzilla, Kiryu proceeds to destroy the city around it after Godzilla retreats to the ocean floor. Horrified, the Kiryu Squadron can only watch in alarm as the rampaging cyborg destroys more city property than Godzilla did. After one hour, Kiryu runs out of energy and is brought back to headquarters for further work. All the while, Akane deals with Hayama resenting her and trying to get her to leave, along with Tokumitsu‚Äôs attempts to get to know her despite her always seeking solitude. Later, Godzilla attacks again. After repairs are made, Kiryu is released from the air and hits Godzilla with immense speed. Godzilla and Mechagodzilla face off in a head-to-head battle where each combatant sizes up its opposite and exchange powerful blows that devastate the cityscape around them. Kiryu gains the upper hand and beats down Godzilla. Kiryu proceeds to launch the Absolute Zero Cannon, but Godzilla fires its atomic breath. During the course of the impact, Kiryu is disabled, and the remote piloting system completely taken off-line. In an effort to continue the fight, Akane orders Hayama to land his command craft so that she can make her way to Mechagodzilla and take control from its internal backup cockpit. As she leaves, Hayama wishes her good luck signifying he forgives her, to which she gives a thumbs up. Now under direct human control, Kiryu rises from the ground one more time and closes in on Godzilla for a final blow, hoping to use the Absolute Zero Cannon at point-blank range. The two titans collide, and Akane uses Kiryu's thrusters to propel it and Godzilla out to sea before firing, freezing a huge portion of the ocean around them. After the blast clears, Godzilla is shown to be alive but with a huge gash in its chest, walking back into the ocean. Kiryu is heavily damaged, missing its right arm, and the Absolute Zero Cannon is devastated. With Squadron Kiryu successful in repelling the monster, Kiryu is taken back to base for repairs. In a post-credits scene, Akane agrees to have dinner with Tokumitsu and his daughter Sara and gives Kiryu one last salute. Cast Production * Mechagodzilla is mostly referred to by the name Kiryu (derived from Kikai-ryu, the Japanese word for \\"machine dragon\\") throughout the film. This was done to differentiate the character from previous versions. It was, however, referred to as \\"Mecha-G\\" and \\"Mechagodzilla\\" in the English dubbing of the next film, Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.. * Japanese baseball star Hideki Matsui has a cameo as himself in the film, due to his nickname \\"Godzilla\\". * As has been done since the early 1970s, Toho had the international version of Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla dubbed in Hong Kong. This dubbed version was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in 2004.  Soundtrack  Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla the first film of the series with a soundtrack recorded outside of Japan. Director Masaaki Tezuka once again turned to composer Michiru Oshima following their successful collaboration on Godzilla X Megagurius, with the score itself being recorded by Moscow International Symphonic Orchestra, under conductor Konstantin D. Krimets. Tezuka and Oshima would both return for the film's sequel, Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. Release Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla was released in Japan on 14 December 2002. Budgeted at roughly $8.5 million, Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla opened in Japan on December 13, 2002, and earned $2,253,231 in its opening weekend. It went on to gross approximately $16 million in Japan, making it the second biggest hit of the Millennium Godzilla films at the box office. It sold approximately 1.7 million admissions. Critical reaction Reviews of Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla have been positive. Mike Pinsky of DVD Talk gave the film three stars out of five, saying: \\"While I did have some minor complaints, [this is] a fine entry in the series.\\" Pinsky said \\"the plot is more interesting than most giant monster movies,\\" and \\"the battle scenes, which are the main reason anyone watches these films to begin with, were great.\\"Review - Mike Pinsky.

The high southern part of the plateau was sighted for the first time by Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein in 1925, and on another expedition in the following year he fixed the eastern escarpment of the plateau and first realised the true size of the plateau. In 1930 an expedition headed by Ralph Alger Bagnold followed the same route. In the winter of 1930-1 P. A. Clayton surveyed some of the area. The western side of the Gilf Kebir was explored in 1932 by the Clayton-Alm√°sy Expedition, headed by Sir Robert East Clayton and Count L√°szl√≥ E. Alm√°sy, and accompanied by Patrick A. Clayton, Squadron Leader H. W. G. J. Penderel, three Arabian car drivers and a cook. The expedition explored the area by Gypsy Moth plane, by car and on foot. 1933 Patrick Clayton and Ladislaus Almasy discovered the Aqaba-Pass, the only way up Gilf Kebir from the southern plains i.e. from wadi Sura.Exploration and mapping of Gilf Kebir retrieved 16 April 2020 =WWII archeology= The plateau was the site for various British logistical operations during the Second World War, and due to the extremely dry conditions and lack of population, remains of this occupation are often found intact. A large airbase, including huge navigation arrows laid out in army petrol cans, can still be seen at the Eight Bells spot in the south-east of Gilf Kebir. It was also the site of the recent discovery of a bag which had been lost in the Second World War by a dispatch rider (Alec Ross) of the Long Range Desert Group, part of the British Army. This contained the rider's personal letters and photographs, and had been well preserved. Literary setting The Gilf Kebir is the setting for part of Michael Ondaatje's novel The English Patient.

Starting from the 1990s, scientists have discovered some very large carnosaurs in the carcharodontosaurid family, such as Giganotosaurus and Tyrannotitan which are among the largest known predatory dinosaurs. While it originally contained a wide assortment of giant theropods that were not closely related, the group has since been defined to encompass only the allosaurs and their closest kin. However, with the description and publication in 2019 of Asfaltovenator vialidadi, a basal allosauroid curiously displaying both primitive and derived features seen in Tetanurae, the new phylogenetic analysis has found Megalosauroidea to be a basal grade of carnosaurs in respect to Allosauroidea; thus significantly expanding Carnosauria's inclusiveness towards its original context. Distinctive characteristics of carnosaurs include large eyes, a long narrow skull and modifications of the legs and pelvis such as the thigh (femur) being longer than the shin (tibia). Carnosaurs first appeared in the Middle Jurassic, around 176 mya. The last definite known carnosaurs, the carcharodontosaurs, became extinct in the Turonian epoch of the Cretaceous, roughly 90 mya; reportedly later remains of carcharodontosaurids, from the Campanian and Maastrichtian epochs, are possibly misidentified remains of abelisaurids. The phylogenetically problematic megaraptorans, which may not be carnosaurs, became extinct around 84 mya. Remains probably belonging to carcharodontosaurids have been found from the late Maastrichtian (70‚Äì66 Ma ago) in Brazil. Systematics Modern cladistic analysis defines Carnosauria as those tetanurans sharing a more recent common ancestor with Allosaurus than with modern birds. =Taxonomy= Carnosauria has traditionally been used as a dumping ground for all large theropods. Even non-dinosaurs, such as the rauisuchian Teratosaurus, were once considered carnosaurs. However, analysis in the 1980s and 1990s revealed that other than size, the group shared very few characteristics, making it polyphyletic. Most former carnosaurs (such as the megalosaurids, the spinosaurids, and the ceratosaurs) were reclassified as more primitive theropods. Others (such as the tyrannosaurids) that were more closely related to birds were placed in Coelurosauria. =Phylogeny= The clade Allosauroidea was originally proposed by Phil Currie and Zhao (1993; p. 2079), and later used as an undefined stem-based taxon by Paul Sereno (1997). Sereno (1998; p. 64) was the first to provide a stem-based definition for the Allosauroidea, defining the clade as \\"All neotetanurans closer to Allosaurus than to Neornithes.\\" Kevin Padian (2007) used a node-based definition, defined the Allosauroidea as Allosaurus, Sinraptor, their most recent common ancestor, and all of its descendants. Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues (2004; p. 100) and Phil Currie and Ken Carpenter (2000), among others, have followed this node- based definition. However, in some analyses (such as Currie & Carpenter, 2000), the placement of the carcharodontosaurids relative to the allosaurids and sinraptorids is uncertain, and therefore it is uncertain whether or not they are allosauroids (Currie & Carpenter, 2000). The cladogram presented here follows the 2010 analysis by Benson, Carrano and Brusatte. In 2019, Rauhut and Pol described Asfaltovenator vialidadi, a basal allosauroid displaying a mosaic of primitive and derived features seen within Tetanurae. Their phylogenetic analysis found traditional Megalosauroidea to represent a basal grade of carnosaurs, paraphyletic with respect to Allosauroidea. \\"Carnosaurus\\" \\"Carnosaurus\\" is an informal generic name, attributed to Friedrich von Huene, ca. 1929. It is the result of a typographical error created by the translation of the von Huene monograph from German to Spanish.

It tells the story of a novice midshipman, Peter Palafox, who joins George Anson's voyage around the world beginning in 1740. The story is written much in the language and spelling of the mid-18th century. Palafox is a Protestant Irish boy from the west coast of Ireland, schooled by his father, a churchman, and eager to join the Royal Navy. He learns naval discipline and how to determine his ship's position at sea as part of a large berth of midshipmen on HMS Centurion. His friend Sean O'Mara joins with him, considered his servant initially by officers and put among the seamen, rising in rank as he shows his abilities, to bosun's mate. The book contains a wealth of period detail, and includes historical figures, like Anson, the midshipman Keppel, Mr Walter, the chaplain to Anson and kind guide and keeper of the purse for Peter Palafox, and captains of other vessels in the squadron. Reviews in 1994 found it not a mature work from the author, but showing signs of \\"the Conradian force that shows where O'Brian was headed as a narrative writer.\\" Another reviewer felt this novel showed nearly \\"all the naval lore and sense of place that grace the Aubrey/Maturin books\\". It was aimed at younger readers, but two reviewers felt that all readers \\"will be swept up by the richness of O'Brian's prodigious imagination\\", and it was \\"A humorous adventure for all collections.\\" Plot summary In spring 1740, Peter Palafox, his friend Sean O'Mara and Sean's uncle Liam are riding from Connaught to Cork so that Peter can join the Royal Navy as a midshipman. Sean decides to join, too, so Liam will take the horses back home. They meet Peregrine FitzGerald at the market fair, another boy heading for HMS Centurion. Both lose their money. FitzGerald meets Lord Culmore who loans him ten guineas, solving their money problems. They meet the brig Mary Rose, at Cove of Cork and reach HMS Centurion at Spithead on time. Peter is wearing all his best clothes, including a green stone given to him as a \\"luck giver\\". On board Peter learns he must have a sea chest and a uniform. Mr Walter, the chaplain, recognises the emerald pinned to his neck cloth, which can supply all that Peter needs. The emerald from a Spanish ship of the Armada now helps Peter as England fights Spain. Peter likes the ship HMS Centurion, but takes time to be at ease with naval discipline. Peter knows the Irish names for the parts of a ship, but not yet the English names. At dinner with Commodore Anson he meets officers on his ship and others in the squadron. Neighbour to Peter is Captain Callis, a man who loved Peter's mother long ago and lost her to Peter's father. Anson remarks on the terrible decision by the Admiralty to include the Chelsea pensioners (500 infirm sailors) as part of his crew. Peter tells the chaplain that he knows the ship's destination, to the golden ocean, the Pacific, to fight the Spanish. Anson is disappointed that his secret mission is common knowledge on the Irish coast. Common knowledge also knows that the Spanish have a squadron of the same number of ships, under Pizarro. The true voyage begins, after the squadron escorts merchant ships heading east. Six weeks of contrary winds keep them in the English Channel, long enough for the landsman to be used to the sea. FitzGerald, wounded in his fight with Ransome, is now ready for duty, assigned to a watch. When sent to the topmast, FitzGerald can barely do it. Ransome helps him down, so FitzGerald apologises to him. Peter is at home up on the masts, with no fear of heights or the motion of the ship. At Funchal in Madeira in November, FitzGerald returns to England, carrying a letter from Peter to his father, and many gifts for his siblings. Mr Elliot, midshipman, teaches Peter the trigonometry, by the example of a stick of known height and its shadow, a tree whose shadow is paced out, thus the height of the tree is calculated; Peter understands it and succeeds in his classes on board. Before the equator, Peter gets a delirious fever, lasting until they land at Saint Catherine's island off Brazil, where they stay past Christmas. Many die of tropical diseases. Mr Ransome is friendlier with him, but still calls him Teague, an insulting name for an Irish boy. Rounding Cape Horn is fierce. They meet with high winds, thick fog, bitter cold and storms, naming several rendezvous points in the Pacific. Pearl rejoins after having fallen in with five Spanish ships, the fleet Peter described to Anson. In March 1741, they reach 52 degrees 32 minutes south. Peter is glad for the warm clothes from FitzGerald. None agree on the longitude in waters uncharted by the English. Peter's ribs are broken from a rope that froze in this cold, windy weather; he feels lucky he was not tossed into the sea like so many others. Mr Elliot is taken by the scurvy in April, a sore loss to Peter, just after they lose Pearl and Severn. Centurion, Gloucester, Wager, Tryal and the pink Anna think they are west enough to turn north. Hopelessness pervades. Commodore Anson appears to be made of \\"iron and oak\\", a little more affable the worse the weather gets. Sean is captain of the foretop, as he performs well, being sure-footed and brave with frozen sails and ropes. Centurion reaches Juan Fernandez, staying there a few months to fix ships and heal the men with good food there. Peter spends a second birthday as a midshipman, having learned the tone of authority and grown out of his best clothes. Peter computes the losses of crew on Centurion, Gloucester and Tryal since leaving England: 961 sailed out, 626 dead after reaching Juan Fernandez. Tryal takes a prize, a Spanish merchant ship, which vessel replaces the damaged Tryal. Spanish passengers are well-treated, a wise move. Wager never makes this rendezvous. Reduced squadron sails north, reaching Paita. Centurion and Tryal crews take the town, made easier by the fear of the locals, who flee on seeing them. An Irishman living there tells Peter where the huge merchant treasure is. They take the ship with the merchant treasure, truly great wealth. All the crew become experts on the rules of sharing prizes, happy with the share they will see. They keep sailing north, aiming for the Acapulco Galleon, which sails between Manila and Acapulco with treasure. Missing the galleon, the Commodore sails west to Manila. Storm damaged Gloucester is burned at sea, and her crew taken aboard Centurion, the only ship of the squadron now. Centurion stops at Tinian Island in September 1742. Peter is carried ashore. His health is improved by the fresh food. Centurion sails to Macau, next to Canton, to refit the ship. Peter spends two years of pay in less than a month. They lose Mr Walter and some officers, who take a merchant ship on the well-travelled route back to England, to report progress and carry mail and gifts home. Refit and rested, Centurion is homeward bound. Commodore Anson, once at sea, informs the crew of 227 that they will try again for the Acapulco Galleon, before she reaches Manila. Sailing east, Centurion waits for the galleon, engaging her in close battle on June 20, 1743, taking her and her cargo of silver and gold. Mr Saumarez sails the prize and both ships stopped in Macau to transfer the treasure to Centurion. Sean is promoted to bosun's mate, guarding the treasure aboard the prize and Centurion for the year's voyage home. Truly homeward bound, they put in at Prince's Island, Cape Town (gaining Dutch seamen), speeding to England through a fog in the Channel where they pass unseen French ships, now at war with England. Peter and Sean are paid their shares of the prizes. All of his family is on the lookout for him, for a joyous reunion after four years away. Peter gives his father the good round sum of 1,000 pounds, which will lift his family from genteel poverty.

Reviewers viewed the novel as it stood and in contrast to the author's later level of accomplishments in that series. Publishers Weekly, writing in 1994, says this first sea novel by O'Brian \\"can stand on its own as an entertaining and psychologically astute narrative\\". They see in this 1956 novel \\"practically all the naval lore and sense of place that grace the Aubrey/Maturin books\\". Specifically, \\"Shipboard life rings true, the story never flags and humor abounds: \\"Well, he is a wonderful poacher for a Protestant,\\" observes one Anglo-Irishman. Kirkus Reviews finds this novel \\"Not a mature piece of work, but appealing enough to satisfy fans of O'Brian's naval sagas.\\" Tom Clark writing in the Los Angeles Times says that \\"evidently in keeping with an aim of appealing to a younger audience, the darker aspects of the crew's experience are played down in favor of a robust and exhilarating rendering of the great adventure of it all.\\" It is a first sea novel with a young boy as the main character, but \\"if there's any character in The Golden Ocean with heavyweight potential, it's the sea itself, whose power as a kind of fate is rendered with the Conradian force that shows where O'Brian was headed as a narrative writer.\\" Clark notes that \\"At least two of those accounts, those of Anson's chaplain, Richard Walter, and of a young Irish midshipman, John Philips, appear to have supplied O'Brian much of what he needed to paint with charming pictorial realism the life both above and below decks on Anson's flagship Centurion.\\" Library Journal noted that this book by O'Brian \\"set the course they [Aubrey-Maturin series] later followed.\\" It is recommended for all ages: \\"A humorous adventure for all collections.\\" Scott Veale writing in The New York Times was upbeat about this novel, saying that \\"As always, the author's erudition and humor are on display, whether he's describing the singing of the masts in the wind, the harrowing seas of Cape Horn or 18th-century superstitions.\\" Veale found the period detail to be \\"uncompromising\\", and expected that readers \\"will be swept up by the richness of O'Brian's prodigious imagination.\\" Related novels by O'Brian and contrasts to them The same expedition is described from the perspective of two on one of the ships in the squadron that did not make it around the globe in O'Brian's The Unknown Shore. It focusses on the ship HMS Wager and different main characters, including John Byron, then a midshipman, age 18. Mr Walter the chaplain wrote his own account of the voyage of Anson, noted by Clark (above) as one of O'Brian's historical sources for this novel and the interactions among the officers and crew. An original copy was at auction in 2009. In 1969, O'Brian published Master and Commander, the first book in a 20 novel series, known as the Aubrey-Maturin series. It is set in the Napoleonic Wars, begins in 1800, and features a pair of men who become the closest of friends, Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, physician and natural philosopher. In Post Captain, the second novel of the series, Aubrey recalls Anson, and asks Maturin if he has read Anson's book. Maturin has, but finds Anson's journey wasteful, as Anson noted nothing of the natural world that he saw on the journey. Aubrey is impressed that Anson made the journey and succeeded in it. The Royal Navy has changed since Anson's voyage, as have the politics of the world, with the thirteen British colonies in North America now the nation of the United States of America, the War of the Austrian Succession over, including the exit of France from nearly all its North American colonies, the French Revolution in the past, and the Irish Rebellion of 1798 also a past event. The Royal Navy and physicians have learned the need for fresh food and citrus to combat scurvy, a disease which killed so many in Anson's squadron, before this connection was made between scurvy and fresh food. The Napoleonic Wars endured so long, that they make a broad canvas of history against which the author sets the lives of his main characters, still keeping a sharp eye to historical detail and period language, which is a different structure than The Golden Ocean, which tells the tale of one long and daring voyage. In one sense, O'Brian views the long eighteenth century as the setting of his works, putting this novel in the same time period as the later series, while technically happening in two different centuries, the 18th and the 19th. They are both set in the Age of Sail, an even longer period of time than the long eighteenth century. Allusions to history and real places The story is based on a real event, George Anson's voyage around the world that began in 1740. Places named in Ireland, England, Madeira, the Pacific coast of South America, Manila, Macau and Canton in China are real, including St. Catherine's Island off Brazil at 24 degrees South latitude, shown on this map. The Spanish galleon Nuestra Se√±ora de la Covadonga, after the battle, was sold at Macau and the treasure transferred to Centurion, which proceeded to England after a brief rest, arriving there in June 1744. Narrative point of view This novel was aimed at younger readers, as well as adults, and takes the viewpoint of a new midshipman joining the Royal Navy on HMS Centurion in 1740 on this voyage. The boy is on the one ship that makes the entire voyage, and he is one of the survivors. Seen by the midshipman Peter Palafox, the sense of the adventure is depicted, as he sees the world and learns the discipline, hardships and rewards of the Royal Navy. The hardships of the voyage are not dismissed, with counts of the deaths from scurvy, whose cure was not yet understood, and the problems of navigation without the precise knowledge of location gained by chronometers to measure longitude, depicted in detail. Publication history Rupert Hart-Davis published many of O'Brian's works, including translations (e.g., Papillon and Banco: The Further Advancement of Papillon in 1970 and 1973), The Road to Samarcand, The Golden Ocean, The Unknown Shore and short stories from 1953 to 1974. In 1994, The Golden Ocean was re-issued by HarperCollins in the UK and W W Norton in the US.

It is the story of two friends, Jack Byron and Tobias Barrow, who sail aboard HMS Wager as part of the voyage around the world led by Anson in 1740. Their ship did not make it all the way around the world, unlike the flag ship. The novel is a fictionalised version of actual events which occurred during the Wager Mutiny. Some reviewers feel that the midshipman Byron and the somewhat unworldly surgeon's mate Barrow are prototypes for Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, who appear in O'Brian's Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin series set in the Napoleonic Wars. Plot summary In the early part of the novel, set in London, other members of the expedition are featured. They appear in more detail in The Golden Ocean, another O'Brian novel about the Anson expedition. The expedition is beset by storms while rounding of Cape Horn, the Wager is shipwrecked off the coast of Chile as their position could not be determined. The crew reject the authority of their officers, once the ship was wrecked and leave the captain, some officers and some other crew on the island when they sail away in a boat built from the wreck. The marooned officers make their way to a Spanish settlement with the help of the native people. The novel is based on the accounts of the survivors. Survivors from the lower deck made their way back to Britain long before the officers. The novel describes the crew members asserting that the officers had no authority over them, once their ship was wrecked. Characters in The Unknown Shore *Jack Byron ‚Äì protagonist *Tobias Barrow ‚Äì \\"Jack's\\" friend Allusions to real events, the shipwreck The Wager's crew did reject the authority of their officers, once the ship was wrecked. The lesson of the wreck of the Wager played a role in revising naval discipline, so that officers did retain formal authority over crew members, even when their ships were lost or captured. Allusions to real persons John \\"Jack\\" Byron was a historical person and the basic facts of the story are true. He went on to a distinguished naval career, rising to the rank of vice-admiral. There is an \\"easter egg\\" that O'Brian includes in the novel: his Jack Byron secretly writes poetry. He wants Tobias to refrain from mentioning it to any of his peers. The famous poet Lord Byron was one of John Byron's grandsons.

Critical reception In his review in Melody Maker, Colin Irwin wrote: \\"I love French Record. I'm intoxicated by its shambling nonchalance; I'm seduced by its gentle, subtle nuances; and I'm in gleeful awe of its absolute, uncalculating disregard for the dictates of current style and influence. [...] It exudes such an enchanting atmosphere that it doesn't matter that you can't understand a damn thing they're on about (though translations are supplied on the sleeve). [...] It's a collection that swamps you in its sheer romance; yet stealthily avoids the danger of being dragged into slush by the discreet arrangements and surprisingly broad array of styles within the sentiment. [...] The music contains such a depth of feeling and emotion, it's obviously a work Kate and Anna have had in their hearts for a long time. [...] Ultimately, it's those harmonies that grab you tightest... joyful, mournful, bright, dour... no studio effect on Earth can communicate the disparate highs and lows of human emotion as eloquently as the bare voices of these two girls. You don't need to be a Frenchman to be convinced of that.\\" via: Lanken, Dane (2007). Kate and Anna McGarrigle Songs and Stories, p. 64‚Äì65. Canada: Penumbra Press. In his review in Rolling Stone, Don Shewey stated: \\"All [tracks] boast the tunefulness, instant familiarity and (judging from the characteristically whimsical liner notes) intelligently emotional subject matter for which the McGarrigles are known and loved. Fortunately, their usual spicy folk instrumentation remains intact. [...] \\"Unexpectedly, singing in French inspires the McGarrigles, especially Anna, to new levels of passion. The author of \\"Heart Like a Wheel\\" (which Linda Ronstadt made famous), Anna has generally sung in a wistfully frail soprano. But on French Record, particularly in \\"Mais Quand Tu Danses\\" and \\"Excursion √† Venise,\\" she reveals a large, gutsy, even guttural voice that's a pleasure to discover. [...] Nearly all the songs, whether by Kate or Anna, are collaborations with Canadian poet Philippe Tatartcheff. Most are distinctive for their offhand imagery and dry wit. [...] It's good to have the mischievous McGarrigles back!\\" In his review in Folk Roots magazine, Lawrence H. Heath stated: \\"French Record was put on Earth to be enjoyed, to be delighted in [...]. It's just two French-Canadian sisters with heaven-sent voices and heartfelt harmonies, singing melodies that could move mountains to tears in the company of musicians whose empathy is exceeded only by their sureness of touch. [...] It's just the best album Kate and Anna McGarrigle have made to date, that's all (and everything!) [...] French Record is one of those rare albums without a single duff track -- or nanosecond for that matter.\\" Release history The album was released on vinyl LP with two different covers: the first by K√©bec- Disc in Canada, titled Entre la jeunesse et la sagesse in May 1980, and the second by Hannibal Records in the rest of the world, titled simply French Record, in February 1981. it was re-released on CD in 2003 by La Tribu, with both French Record and Entre Lajeunesse et la sagesse appearing in the title, and on the same cover as the original Hannibal LP.

The formulation and clarification of such rules have a long tradition in the history of philosophy and logic. Generally they are taken as laws that guide and underlie everyone's thinking, thoughts, expressions, discussions, etc. However, such classical ideas are often questioned or rejected in more recent developments, such as intuitionistic logic, dialetheism and fuzzy logic. According to the 1999 Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,\\"Laws of thought\\". The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy. Robert Audi, Editor, Cambridge: Cambridge UP. p. 489. laws of thought are laws by which or in accordance with which valid thought proceeds, or that justify valid inference, or to which all valid deduction is reducible. Laws of thought are rules that apply without exception to any subject matter of thought, etc.; sometimes they are said to be the object of logic. The term, rarely used in exactly the same sense by different authors, has long been associated with three equally ambiguous expressions: the law of identity (ID), the law of contradiction (or non-contradiction; NC), and the law of excluded middle (EM). Sometimes, these three expressions are taken as propositions of formal ontology having the widest possible subject matter, propositions that apply to entities as such: (ID), everything is (i.e., is identical to) itself; (NC) no thing having a given quality also has the negative of that quality (e.g., no even number is non-even); (EM) every thing either has a given quality or has the negative of that quality (e.g., every number is either even or non-even). Equally common in older works is the use of these expressions for principles of metalogic about propositions: (ID) every proposition implies itself; (NC) no proposition is both true and false; (EM) every proposition is either true or false. Beginning in the middle to late 1800s, these expressions have been used to denote propositions of Boolean Algebra about classes: (ID) every class includes itself; (NC) every class is such that its intersection (\\"product\\") with its own complement is the null class; (EM) every class is such that its union (\\"sum\\") with its own complement is the universal class. More recently, the last two of the three expressions have been used in connection with the classical propositional logic and with the so-called protothetic or quantified propositional logic; in both cases the law of non- contradiction involves the negation of the conjunction (\\"and\\") of something with its own negation, ¬¨(A‚àß¬¨A), and the law of excluded middle involves the disjunction (\\"or\\") of something with its own negation, A‚à®¬¨A. In the case of propositional logic, the \\"something\\" is a schematic letter serving as a place- holder, whereas in the case of protothetic logic the \\"something\\" is a genuine variable. The expressions \\"law of non-contradiction\\" and \\"law of excluded middle\\" are also used for semantic principles of model theory concerning sentences and interpretations: (NC) under no interpretation is a given sentence both true and false, (EM) under any interpretation, a given sentence is either true or false. The expressions mentioned above all have been used in many other ways. Many other propositions have also been mentioned as laws of thought, including the dictum de omni et nullo attributed to Aristotle, the substitutivity of identicals (or equals) attributed to Euclid, the so-called identity of indiscernibles attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and other \\"logical truths\\". The expression \\"laws of thought\\" gained added prominence through its use by Boole (1815‚Äì64) to denote theorems of his \\"algebra of logic\\"; in fact, he named his second logic book An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities (1854). Modern logicians, in almost unanimous disagreement with Boole, take this expression to be a misnomer; none of the above propositions classed under \\"laws of thought\\" are explicitly about thought per se, a mental phenomenon studied by psychology, nor do they involve explicit reference to a thinker or knower as would be the case in pragmatics or in epistemology. The distinction between psychology (as a study of mental phenomena) and logic (as a study of valid inference) is widely accepted. The three traditional laws =History= Hamilton offers a history of the three traditional laws that begins with Plato, proceeds through Aristotle, and ends with the schoolmen of the Middle Ages; in addition he offers a fourth law (see entry below, under Hamilton): :\\"The principles of Contradiction and Excluded Middle can be traced back to Plato: The principles of Contradiction and of Excluded Middle can both be traced back to Plato, by whom they were enounced and frequently applied; though it was not till long after, that either of them obtained a distinctive appellation. To take the principle of Contradiction first. This law Plato frequently employs, but the most remarkable passages are found in the Ph≈ìdo, in the Sophista, and in the fourth and seventh books of the Republic. [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 62] :Law of Excluded Middle: The law of Excluded Middle between two contradictories remounts, as I have said, also to Plato, though the Second Alcibiades, the dialogue in which it is most clearly expressed, must be admitted to be spurious. It is also in the fragments of Pseudo-Archytas, to be found in Stob√¶us. [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65] :Hamilton further observes that \\"It is explicitly and emphatically enounced by Aristotle in many passages both of his Metaphysics (l. iii. (iv.) c.7.) and of his Analytics, both Prior (l. i. c. 2) and Posterior (1. i. c. 4). In the first of these, he says: \\"It is impossible that there should exist any medium between contradictory opposites, but it is necessary either to affirm or to deny everything of everything.\\" [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65] :\\"Law of Identity. [Hamilton also calls this \\"The principle of all logical affirmation and definition\\"] Antonius Andreas: The law of Identity, I stated, was not explicated as a coordinate principle till a comparatively recent period. The earliest author in whom I have found this done, is Antonius Andreas, a scholar of Scotus, who flourished at the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century. The schoolman, in the fourth book of his Commentary of Aristotle's Metaphysics ‚Äì a commentary which is full of the most ingenious and original views, ‚Äì not only asserts to the law of Identity a coordinate dignity with the law of Contradiction, but, against Aristotle, he maintains that the principle of Identity, and not the principle of Contradiction, is the one absolutely first. The formula in which Andreas expressed it was Ens est ens. Subsequently to this author, the question concerning the relative priority of the two laws of Identity and of Contradiction became one much agitated in the schools; though there were also found some who asserted to the law of Excluded Middle this supreme rank.\\" [From Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65-66] = Three traditional laws: identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle = The following will state the three traditional \\"laws\\" in the words of Bertrand Russell (1912): The law of identity The law of identity: 'Whatever is, is.'Russell 1912:72,1997 edition. For all a: a = a. Regarding this law, Aristotle wrote: More than two millennia later, George Boole alluded to the very same principle as did Aristotle when Boole made the following observation with respect to the nature of language and those principles that must inhere naturally within them: The law of non-contradiction The law of non- contradiction (alternately the 'law of contradiction'Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition): 'Nothing can both be and not be.' In other words: \\"two or more contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time\\": ¬¨(A‚àß¬¨A). In the words of Aristotle, that \\"one cannot say of something that it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time\\". As an illustration of this law, he wrote: The law of excluded middle The law of excluded middle: 'Everything must either be or not be.' In accordance with the law of excluded middle or excluded third, for every proposition, either its positive or negative form is true: A‚à®¬¨A. Regarding the law of excluded middle, Aristotle wrote: =Rationale= As the quotations from Hamilton above indicate, in particular the \\"law of identity\\" entry, the rationale for and expression of the \\"laws of thought\\" have been fertile ground for philosophic debate since Plato. Today the debate‚Äîabout how we \\"come to know\\" the world of things and our thoughts‚Äîcontinues; for examples of rationales see the entries, below. Plato In one of Plato's Socratic dialogues, Socrates described three principles derived from introspection: Indian logic The law of non- contradiction is found in ancient Indian logic as a meta-rule in the Shrauta Sutras, the grammar of PƒÅ·πáini, (cf. ) and the Brahma Sutras attributed to Vyasa. It was later elaborated on by medieval commentators such as Madhvacharya. Locke John Locke claimed that the principles of identity and contradiction (i.e. the law of identity and the law of non-contradiction) were general ideas and only occurred to people after considerable abstract, philosophical thought. He characterized the principle of identity as \\"Whatsoever is, is.\\" He stated the principle of contradiction as \\"It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.\\" To Locke, these were not innate or a priori principles. Leibniz Gottfried Leibniz formulated two additional principles, either or both of which may sometimes be counted as a law of thought: :* principle of sufficient reason :* identity of indiscernibles In Leibniz's thought, as well as generally in the approach of rationalism, the latter two principles are regarded as clear and incontestable axioms. They were widely recognized in European thought of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, although they were subject to greater debate in the 19th century. As turned out to be the case with the law of continuity, these two laws involve matters which, in contemporary terms, are subject to much debate and analysis (respectively on determinism and extensionality). Leibniz's principles were particularly influential in German thought. In France, the Port-Royal Logic was less swayed by them. Hegel quarrelled with the identity of indiscernibles in his Science of Logic (1812‚Äì1816). Schopenhauer =Four laws= \\"The primary laws of thought, or the conditions of the thinkable, are four: - 1\\\\. The law of identity [A is A]. 2. The law of contradiction. 3. The law of exclusion; or excluded middle. 4. The law of sufficient reason.\\" (Thomas Hughes, The Ideal Theory of Berkeley and the Real World, Part II, Section XV, Footnote, p. 38) Arthur Schopenhauer discussed the laws of thought and tried to demonstrate that they are the basis of reason. He listed them in the following way in his On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, ¬ß33: #A subject is equal to the sum of its predicates, or a = a. #No predicate can be simultaneously attributed and denied to a subject, or a ‚â† ~a. #Of every two contradictorily opposite predicates one must belong to every subject. #Truth is the reference of a judgment to something outside it as its sufficient reason or ground. Also: To show that they are the foundation of reason, he gave the following explanation: Schopenhauer's four laws can be schematically presented in the following manner: #A is A. #A is not not-A. #X is either A or not-A. #If A then B (A implies B). =Two laws= Later, in 1844, Schopenhauer claimed that the four laws of thought could be reduced to two. In the ninth chapter of the second volume of The World as Will and Representation, he wrote: Boole (1854): From his \\"laws of the mind\\" Boole derives Aristotle's \\"Law of contradiction\\"  The title of George Boole's 1854 treatise on logic, An Investigation on the Laws of Thought, indicates an alternate path. The laws are now incorporated into an algebraic representation of his \\"laws of the mind\\", honed over the years into modern Boolean algebra. = Rationale: How the \\"laws of the mind\\" are to be distinguished = Boole begins his chapter I \\"Nature and design of this Work\\" with a discussion of what characteristic distinguishes, generally, \\"laws of the mind\\" from \\"laws of nature\\": : \\"The general laws of Nature are not, for the most part, immediate objects of perception. They are either inductive inferences from a large body of facts, the common truth in which they express, or, in their origin at least, physical hypotheses of a causal nature. . . . They are in all cases, and in the strictest sense of the term, probable conclusions, approaching, indeed, ever and ever nearer to certainty, as they receive more and more of the confirmation of experience. ...‚Äù Contrasted with this are what he calls \\"laws of the mind\\": Boole asserts these are known in their first instance, without need of repetition: :‚ÄúOn the other hand, the knowledge of the laws of the mind does not require as its basis any extensive collection of observations. The general truth is seen in the particular instance, and it is not confirmed by the repetition of instances. ... we not only see in the particular example the general truth, but we see it also as a certain truth -- a truth, our confidence in which will not continue to increase with increasing experience of its practical verification.‚Äù (Boole 1854:4) = Boole's signs and their laws = Boole begins with the notion of \\"signs\\" representing \\"classes\\", \\"operations\\" and \\"identity\\": :\\"All the signs of Language, as an instrument of reasoning may be conducted by a system of signs composed of the following elements ::\\"1st Literal symbols as x, y, etc representing things as subjects of our conceptions, ::\\"2nd Signs of operation, as +, ‚àí, x standing for those operations of the mind by which conceptions of things are combined or resolved so as to form new conceptions involving the same elements, ::\\"3rd The sign of identity, =. :And these symbols of Logic are in their use subject to definite laws, partly agreeing with and partly differing from the laws of the corresponding symbols in the science of Algebra. (Boole 1854:27) Boole then clarifies what a \\"literal symbol\\" e.g. x, y, z,... represents‚Äîa name applied to a collection of instances into \\"classes\\". For example, \\"bird\\" represents the entire class of feathered winged warm-blooded creatures. For his purposes he extends the notion of class to represent membership of \\"one\\", or \\"nothing\\", or \\"the universe\\" i.e. totality of all individuals: :\\"Let us then agree to represent the class of individuals to which a particular name or description is applicable, by a single letter, as z. ... By a class is usually meant a collection of individuals, to each of which a particular name or description may be applied; but in this work the meaning of the term will be extended so as to include the case in which but a single individual exists, answering to the required name or description, as well as the cases denoted by the terms \\"nothing\\" and \\"universe,\\" which as \\"classes\\" should be understood to comprise respectively 'no beings,' 'all beings.'\\" (Boole 1854:28) He then defines what the string of symbols e.g. xy means [modern logical &, conjunction]: :\\"Let it further be agreed, that by the combination xy shall be represented that class of things to which the names or descriptions represented by x and y are simultaneously, applicable. Thus, if x alone stands for \\"white things,\\" and y for \\"sheep,\\" let xy stand for 'white Sheep;'\\" (Boole 1854:28) Given these definitions he now lists his laws with their justification plus examples (derived from Boole): * (1) xy = yx [commutative law] :: \\"x represents 'estuaries,' and y 'rivers,' the expressions xy and yx will indifferently represent\\" 'rivers that are estuaries,' or 'estuaries that are rivers,'\\" * (2) xx = x, alternately x2 = x [Absolute identity of meaning, Boole's \\"fundamental law of thought\\" cf page 49] :: \\"Thus 'good, good' men, is equivalent to 'good' men\\". Logical OR: Boole defines the \\"collecting of parts into a whole or separate a whole into its parts\\" (Boole 1854:32). Here the connective \\"and\\" is used disjunctively, as is \\"or\\"; he presents a commutative law (3) and a distributive law (4) for the notion of \\"collecting\\". The notion of separating a part from the whole he symbolizes with the \\"-\\" operation; he defines a commutative (5) and distributive law (6) for this notion: * (3) y + x = x + y [commutative law] :: \\"Thus the expression 'men and women' is . . . equivalent with the expression\\" women and men. Let x represent 'men,' y, 'women' and let + stand for 'and' and 'or' . . .\\" * (4) z(x + y) = zx + zy [distributive law] :: z = European, (x = \\"men, y = women): European men and women = European men and European women * (5) x - y = -y + x [commutation law: separating a part from the whole] :: \\"All men (x) except Asiatics (y)\\" is represented by x - y. \\"All states (x) except monarchical states (y)\\" is represented by x - y * (6) z(x - y) = zx - zy [distributive law] Lastly is a notion of \\"identity\\" symbolized by \\"=\\". This allows for two axioms: (axiom 1): equals added to equals results in equals, (axiom 2): equals subtracted from equals results in equals. * (7) Identity (\\"is\\", \\"are\\") e.g. x = y + z, \\"stars\\" = \\"suns\\" and \\"the planets\\" Nothing \\"0\\" and Universe \\"1\\": He observes that the only two numbers that satisfy xx = x are 0 and 1. He then observes that 0 represents \\"Nothing\\" while \\"1\\" represents the \\"Universe\\" (of discourse). The logical NOT: Boole defines the contrary (logical NOT) as follows (his Proposition III): :\\"If x represent any class of objects, then will 1 - x represent the contrary or supplementary class of objects, i.e. the class including all objects which are not comprehended in the class x\\" (Boole 1854:48) ::If x = \\"men\\" then \\"1 - x\\" represents the \\"universe\\" less \\"men\\", i.e. \\"not-men\\". The notion of a particular as opposed to a universal: To represent the notion of \\"some men\\", Boole writes the small letter \\"v\\" before the predicate-symbol \\"vx\\" some men. Exclusive- and inclusive-OR: Boole does not use these modern names, but he defines these as follows x(1-y) + y(1-x) and x + y(1-x), respectively; these agree with the formulas derived by means of the modern Boolean algebra.cf Boole 1842:55-57. The modern definition of logical OR(x, y) in terms of logical AND &, and logical NOT ~ is: ~(~x & ~y). In Boolean algebra this is represented by: 1-((1-x)*(1-y)) = 1 - (1 - 1*x - y*1 + x*y) = x + y - x*y = x + y*(1-x), which is Boole's expression. The exclusive-OR can be checked in a similar manner. =Boole derives the law of contradiction = Armed with his \\"system\\" he derives the \\"principle of [non]contradiction\\" starting with his law of identity: x2 = x. He subtracts x from both sides (his axiom 2), yielding x2 \\\\- x = 0. He then factors out the x: x(x - 1) = 0. For example, if x = \\"men\\" then 1 - x represents NOT-men. So we have an example of the \\"Law of Contradiction\\": :\\"Hence: x(1 - x) will represent the class whose members are at once \\"men,\\" and\\" not men,\\" and the equation [x(1 - x)=0] thus express the principle, that a class whose members are at the same time men and not men does not exist. In other words, that it is impossible for the same individual to be at the same time a man and not a man. . . . this is identically that \\"principle of contradiction\\" which Aristotle has described as the fundamental axiom of all philosophy. . . . what has been commonly regarded as the fundamental axiom of metaphysics is but the consequence of a law of thought, mathematical in its form.\\" (with more explanation about this \\"dichotomy\\" comes about cf Boole 1854:49ff) = Boole defines the notion \\"domain (universe) of discourse\\"= This notion is found throughout Boole's \\"Laws of Thought\\" e.g. 1854:28, where the symbol \\"1\\" (the integer 1) is used to represent \\"Universe\\" and \\"0\\" to represent \\"Nothing\\", and in far more detail later (pages 42ff): :\\" Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. . . . Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.\\" In his chapter \\"The Predicate Calculus\\" Kleene observes that the specification of the \\"domain\\" of discourse is \\"not a trivial assumption, since it is not always clearly satisfied in ordinary discourse . . . in mathematics likewise, logic can become pretty slippery when no D [domain] has been specified explicitly or implicitly, or the specification of a D [domain] is too vague (Kleene 1967:84). Hamilton (1837‚Äì38 lectures on Logic, published 1860): a 4th \\"Law of Reason and Consequent\\" As noted above, Hamilton specifies four laws‚Äîthe three traditional plus the fourth \\"Law of Reason and Consequent\\"‚Äîas follows: :\\"XIII. The Fundamental Laws of Thought, or the conditions of the thinkable, as commonly received, are four: -- 1. The Law of Identity; 2. The Law of Contradiction; 3. The Law of Exclusion or of Excluded Middle; and, 4. The Law of Reason and Consequent, or of Sufficient Reason.\\"William Hamilton, (Henry L. Mansel and John Veitch, ed.), 1860 Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic, in Two Volumes. Vol. II. Logic, Boston: Gould and Lincoln. Hamilton died in 1856, so this is an effort of his editors Mansel and Veitch. Most of the footnotes are additions and emendations by Mansel and Veitch -- see the preface for background information. =Rationale: \\"Logic is the science of the Laws of Thought as Thought\\"= Hamilton opines that thought comes in two forms: \\"necessary\\" and \\"contingent\\" (Hamilton 1860:17). With regards the \\"necessary\\" form he defines its study as \\"logic\\": ‚ÄúLogic is the science of the necessary forms of thought‚Äù (Hamilton 1860:17). To define \\"necessary\\" he asserts that it implies the following four ‚Äúqualities‚Äù:Lecture II LOGIC-I. ITS DEFINITION -HISTORICAL NOTICES OF OPINIONS REGARDING ITS OBJECT AND DOMAIN-II. ITS UTILITY Hamilton 1860:17-18 :(1) ‚Äúdetermined or necessitated by the nature of the thinking subject itself . . . it is subjectively, not objectively, determined; :(2) ‚Äúoriginal and not acquired; :(3) ‚Äúuniversal; that is, it cannot be that it necessitates on some occasions, and does not necessitate on others. :(4) \\"it must be a law; for a law is that which applies to all cases without exception, and from which a deviation is ever, and everywhere, impossible, or, at least, unallowed. . . . This last condition, likewise, enables us to give the most explicit enunciation of the object-matter of Logic, in saying that Logic is the science of the Laws of Thought as Thought, or the science of the Formal Laws of Thought, or the science of the Laws of the Form of Thought; for all these are merely various expressions of the same thing.\\" =Hamilton's 4th law: \\"Infer nothing without ground or reason\\"= Here's Hamilton's fourth law from his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60-61: :\\"I now go on to the fourth law. :\\"Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent: :\\"XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding ‚Äì the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason (principium Rationis Sufficientis); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent (principium Rationis et Consecutionis). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the logical reason ground, or antecedent; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the logical consequent; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the logical connection or consequence. This law is expressed in the formula - Infer nothing without a ground or reason.1 :Relations between Reason and Consequent: The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following: :1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¬∂ exist a consequent; and, vice versa, when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason. ::1 See Schulze, Logik, ¬ß19, and Krug, Logik, ¬ß20, - ED. :2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, vice versa, where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other. :The logical significance of this law: The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, - That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science. Welton In the 19th century, the Aristotelian laws of thoughts, as well as sometimes the Leibnizian laws of thought, were standard material in logic textbooks, and J. Welton described them in this way: Russell (1903‚Äì1927) The sequel to Bertrand Russell's 1903 \\"The Principles of Mathematics\\" became the three volume work named Principia Mathematica (hereafter PM), written jointly with Alfred North Whitehead. Immediately after he and Whitehead published PM he wrote his 1912 \\"The Problems of Philosophy\\". His \\"Problems\\" reflects \\"the central ideas of Russell's logic\\".Commentary by John Perry in Russell 1912, 1997 edition page ix =The Principles of Mathematics (1903)= In his 1903 \\"Principles\\" Russell defines Symbolic or Formal Logic (he uses the terms synonymously) as \\"the study of the various general types of deduction\\" (Russell 1903:11). He asserts that \\"Symbolic Logic is essentially concerned with inference in general\\" (Russell 1903:12) and with a footnote indicates that he does not distinguish between inference and deduction; moreover he considers induction \\"to be either disguised deduction or a mere method of making plausible guesses\\" (Russell 1903:11). This opinion will change by 1912, when he deems his \\"principle of induction\\" to be par with the various \\"logical principles\\" that include the \\"Laws of Thought\\". In his Part I \\"The Indefinables of Mathematics\\" Chapter II \\"Symbolic Logic\\" Part A \\"The Propositional Calculus\\" Russell reduces deduction (\\"propositional calculus\\") to 2 \\"indefinables\\" and 10 axioms: :\\"17. We require, then, in the propositional calculus, no indefinable except the two kinds of implication [simple aka \\"material\\"The \\"simple\\" type of implication, aka material implication, is the logical connective commonly symbolized by ‚Üí or ‚äÉ, e.g. p ‚äÉ q. As a connective it yields the truth value of \\"falsity\\" only when the truth value of statement p is \\"truth\\" when the truth value of statement q is \\"falsity\\"; in 1903 Russell is claiming that \\"A definition of implication is quite impossible\\" (Russell 1903:14). He will overcome this problem in PM with the simple definition of (p ‚äÉ q) =def (NOT-p OR q). and \\"formal\\"]-- remembering, however, that formal implication is a complex notion, whose analysis remains to be undertaken. As regards our two indefinables, we require certain indemonstrable propositions, which hitherto I have not succeeded in reducing to less ten (Russell 1903:15). From these he claims to be able to derive the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction but does not exhibit his derivations (Russell 1903:17). Subsequently, he and Whitehead honed these \\"primitive principles\\" and axioms into the nine found in PM, and here Russell actually exhibits these two derivations at ‚ùã1.71 and ‚ùã3.24, respectively. =The Problems of Philosophy (1912)= By 1912 Russell in his \\"Problems\\" pays close attention to \\"induction\\" (inductive reasoning) as well as \\"deduction\\" (inference), both of which represent just two examples of \\"self-evident logical principles\\" that include the \\"Laws of Thought.\\" Induction principle: Russell devotes a chapter to his \\"induction principle\\". He describes it as coming in two parts: firstly, as a repeated collection of evidence (with no failures of association known) and therefore increasing probability that whenever A happens B follows; secondly, in a fresh instance when indeed A happens, B will indeed follow: i.e. \\"a sufficient number of cases of association will make the probability of a fresh association nearly a certainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit.\\"Russell 1912:66, 1997 edition He then collects all the cases (instances) of the induction principle (e.g. case 1: A1 = \\"the rising sun\\", B1 = \\"the eastern sky\\"; case 2: A2 = \\"the setting sun\\", B2 = \\"the western sky\\"; case 3: etc.) into a \\"general\\" law of induction which he expresses as follows: :\\"(a) The greater the number of cases in which a thing of the sort A has been found associated with a thing of the sort B, the more probable it is (if cases of failure of association are known) that A is always associated with B; :\\"(b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of the association of A with B will make it nearly certain that A is always associated with B, and will make this general law approach certainty without limit.\\"Russell 1912:67, 1997 edition He makes an argument that this induction principle can neither be disproved or proved by experience,name=\\"Russell 1912:70, 1997 the failure of disproof occurring because the law deals with probability of success rather than certainty; the failure of proof occurring because of unexamined cases that are yet to be experienced, i.e. they will occur (or not) in the future. \\"Thus we must either accept the inductive principle on the ground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our expectations about the future\\".name=\\"Russell 1912:69, 1997 In his next chapter (\\"On Our Knowledge of General Principles\\") Russell offers other principles that have this similar property: \\"which cannot be proved or disproved by experience, but are used in arguments which start from what is experienced.\\" He asserts that these \\"have even greater evidence than the principle of induction . . . the knowledge of them has the same degree of certainty as the knowledge of the existence of sense-data. They constitute the means of drawing inferences from what is given in sensation\\".Russell 1912:70, 1997 edition Inference principle: Russell then offers an example that he calls a \\"logical\\" principle. Twice previously he has asserted this principle, first as the 4th axiom in his 1903(4) A true hypothesis in an implication may be dropped, and the consequent asserted. This is a principle incapable of formal symbolic statement . . .\\" (Russell 1903:16) and then as his first \\"primitive proposition\\" of PM: \\"‚ùã1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true\\".Principia Mathematica 1962 edition:94 Now he repeats it in his 1912 in a refined form: \\"Thus our principle states that if this implies that, and this is true, then that is true. In other words, 'anything implied by a true proposition is true', or 'whatever follows from a true proposition is true'.Russell 1912:71, 1997 edition This principle he places great stress upon, stating that \\"this principle is really involved -- at least, concrete instances of it are involved -- in all demonstrations\\". He does not call his inference principle modus ponens, but his formal, symbolic expression of it in PM (2nd edition 1927) is that of modus ponens; modern logic calls this a \\"rule\\" as opposed to a \\"law\\".For example, Alfred Tarski (Tarski 1946:47) distinguishes modus ponens as one of three \\"rules of inference\\" or \\"rules of proof\\", and he asserts that these \\"must not be mistaken for logical laws\\". The two other such \\"rules\\" are that of \\"definition\\" and \\"substitution\\"; see the entry under Tarski. In the quotation that follows, the symbol \\"‚ä¶\\" is the \\"assertion-sign\\" (cf PM:92); ‚Äú‚ä¶\\" means \\"it is true that\\", therefore ‚Äú‚ä¶p‚Äù where \\"p\\" is \\"the sun is rising\\" means \\"it is true that the sun is rising\\", alternately \\"The statement 'The sun is rising' is true\\". The \\"implication\\" symbol \\"‚äÉ\\" is commonly read \\"if p then q\\", or \\"p implies q\\" (cf PM:7). Embedded in this notion of \\"implication\\" are two \\"primitive ideas\\", \\"the Contradictory Function\\" (symbolized by NOT, \\"~\\") and \\"the Logical Sum or Disjunction\\" (symbolized by OR, \\"‚ãÅ\\"); these appear as \\"primitive propositions\\" ‚ùã1.7 and ‚ùã1.71 in PM (PM:97). With these two \\"primitive propositions\\" Russell defines \\"p ‚äÉ q\\" to have the formal logical equivalence \\"NOT-p OR q\\" symbolized by \\"~p ‚ãÅ q\\": :\\"Inference. The process of inference is as follows: a proposition \\"p\\" is asserted, and a proposition \\"p implies q\\" is asserted, and then as a sequel the proposition \\"q\\" is asserted. The trust in inference is the belief that if the two former assertions are not in error, the final assertion is not in error. Accordingly, whenever, in symbols, where p and q have of course special determination ::\\" ‚Äú‚ä¶p‚Äù and ‚Äú‚ä¶(p ‚äÉ q)‚Äù :\\" have occurred, then ‚Äú‚ä¶q‚Äù will occur if it is desired to put it on record. The process of the inference cannot be reduced to symbols. Its sole record is the occurrence of ‚Äú‚ä¶q‚Äù. . . . An inference is the dropping of a true premiss; it is the dissolution of an implication\\".Principia Mathematica 2nd edition (1927), pages 8 and 9. In other words, in a long \\"string\\" of inferences, after each inference we can detach the \\"consequent\\" ‚Äú‚ä¶q‚Äù from the symbol string ‚Äú‚ä¶p, ‚ä¶(p‚äÉq)‚Äù and not carry these symbols forward in an ever- lengthening string of symbols. The three traditional \\"laws\\" (principles) of thought: Russell goes on to assert other principles, of which the above logical principle is \\"only one\\". He asserts that \\"some of these must be granted before any argument or proof becomes possible. When some of them have been granted, others can be proved.\\" Of these various \\"laws\\" he asserts that \\"for no very good reason, three of these principles have been singled out by tradition under the name of 'Laws of Thought'.Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition. And these he lists as follows: : \\"(1) The law of identity: 'Whatever is, is.' : (2) The law of contradiction: 'Nothing can both be and not be.' : (3) The law of excluded middle: 'Everything must either be or not be.'\\" Rationale: Russell opines that \\"the name 'laws of thought' is ... misleading, for what is important is not the fact that we think in accordance with these laws, but the fact that things behave in accordance with them; in other words, the fact that when we think in accordance with them we think truly.\\"Russell 1997:73 reprint of Russell 1912 But he rates this a \\"large question\\" and expands it in two following chapters where he begins with an investigation of the notion of \\"a priori\\" (innate, built-in) knowledge, and ultimately arrives at his acceptance of the Platonic \\"world of universals\\". In his investigation he comes back now and then to the three traditional laws of thought, singling out the law of contradiction in particular: \\"The conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law of thought is nevertheless erroneous . . . [rather], the law of contradiction is about things, and not merely about thoughts . . . a fact concerning the things in the world.\\"Russell 1997:88-89 reprint of Russell 1912 His argument begins with the statement that the three traditional laws of thought are \\"samples of self-evident principles\\". For Russell the matter of \\"self-evident\\"Russell asserts they are \\"self-evident\\" a couple times, at Russell 1912, 1967:72 merely introduces the larger question of how we derive our knowledge of the world. He cites the \\"historic controversy . . . between the two schools called respectively 'empiricists' [ Locke, Berkeley, and Hume ] and 'rationalists' [ Descartes and Leibniz]\\" (these philosophers are his examples).Russell 1912, 1967:73 Russell asserts that the rationalists \\"maintained that, in addition to what we know by experience, there are certain 'innate ideas' and 'innate principles', which we know independently of experience\\"; to eliminate the possibility of babies having innate knowledge of the \\"laws of thought\\", Russell renames this sort of knowledge a priori. And while Russell agrees with the empiricists that \\"Nothing can be known to exist except by the help of experience,\\",\\"That is to say, if we wish to prove that something of which we have no direct experience exists, we must have among our premises the existence of one or more things of which we have direct experience\\"; Russell 1912, 1967:75 he also agrees with the rationalists that some knowledge is a priori, specifically \\"the propositions of logic and pure mathematics, as well as the fundamental propositions of ethics\\".Russell 1912, 1967:80-81 This question of how such a priori knowledge can exist directs Russell to an investigation into the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which after careful consideration he rejects as follows: :\\". . . there is one main objection which seems fatal to any attempt to deal with the problem of a priori knowledge by his method. The thing to be accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to logic and arithmetic. . . . Thus Kant's solution unduly limits the scope of a priori propositions, in addition to failing in the attempt at explaining their certainty\\".Russell 1912, 1967:87,88 His objections to Kant then leads Russell to accept the 'theory of ideas' of Plato, \\"in my opinion . . . one of the most successful attempts hitherto made.\\";Russell 1912, 1967:93 he asserts that \\" . . . we must examine our knowledge of universals . . . where we shall find that [this consideration] solves the problem of a priori knowledge.\\". = Principia Mathematica (Part I: 1910 first edition, 1927 2nd edition) = Unfortunately, Russell's \\"Problems\\" does not offer an example of a \\"minimum set\\" of principles that would apply to human reasoning, both inductive and deductive. But PM does at least provide an example set (but not the minimum; see Post below) that is sufficient for deductive reasoning by means of the propositional calculus (as opposed to reasoning by means of the more-complicated predicate calculus)‚Äîa total of 8 principles at the start of \\"Part I: Mathematical Logic\\". Each of the formulas :‚ùã1.2 to :‚ùã1.6 is a tautology (true no matter what the truth-value of p, q, r ... is). What is missing in PM's treatment is a formal rule of substitution;In his 1944 Russell's mathematical logic, G√∂del observes that \\"What is missing, above all, is a precise statement of the syntax of the formalism. Syntactical considerations are omitted even in cases where they are necessary for the cogency of the proofs . . . The matter is especially doubtful for the rule of substitution and of replacing defined symbols by their definiens . . . it is chiefly the rule of substitution which would have to be proved\\" (G√∂del 1944:124) in his 1921 PhD thesis Emil Post fixes this deficiency (see Post below). In what follows the formulas are written in a more modern format than that used in PM; the names are given in PM). :‚ùã1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true. :‚ùã1.2 Principle of Tautology: (p ‚ãÅ p) ‚äÉ p :‚ùã1.3 Principle of [logical] Addition: q ‚äÉ (p ‚ãÅ q) :‚ùã1.4 Principle of Permutation: (p ‚ãÅ q) ‚äÉ (q ‚ãÅ p) :‚ùã1.5 Associative Principle: p ‚ãÅ (q ‚ãÅ r) ‚äÉ q ‚ãÅ (p ‚ãÅ r) [redundant] :‚ùã1.6 Principle of [logical] Summation: (q ‚äÉ r) ‚äÉ ((p ‚ãÅ q) ‚äÉ (p ‚ãÅ r)) :‚ùã1.7 [logical NOT]: If p is an elementary proposition, ~p is an elementary proposition. :‚ùã1.71 [logical inclusive OR]: If p and q are elementary propositions, (p ‚ãÅ q) is an elementary proposition. Russell sums up these principles with \\"This completes the list of primitive propositions required for the theory of deduction as applied to elementary propositions\\" (PM:97). Starting from these eight tautologies and a tacit use of the \\"rule\\" of substitution, PM then derives over a hundred different formulas, among which are the Law of Excluded Middle ‚ùã1.71, and the Law of Contradiction ‚ùã3.24 (this latter requiring a definition of logical AND symbolized by the modern ‚ãÄ: (p ‚ãÄ q) =def ~(~p ‚ãÅ ~q). (PM uses the \\"dot\\" symbol ‚ñ™ for logical AND)). Ladd-Franklin (1914): \\"principle of exclusion\\" and the \\"principle of exhaustion\\" At about the same time (1912) that Russell and Whitehead were finishing the last volume of their Principia Mathematica, and the publishing of Russell's \\"The Problems of Philosophy\\" at least two logicians (Louis Couturat, Christine Ladd-Franklin) were asserting that two \\"laws\\" (principles) of contradiction\\" and \\"excluded middle\\" are necessary to specify \\"contradictories\\"; Ladd-Franklin renamed these the principles of exclusion and exhaustion. The following appears as a footnote on page 23 of Couturat 1914: :\\"As Mrs. LADD¬∑FRANKLlN has truly remarked (BALDWIN, Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, article \\"Laws of Thought\\"), the principle of contradiction is not sufficient to define contradictories; the principle of excluded middle must be added which equally deserves the name of principle of contradiction. This is why Mrs. LADD-FRANKLIN proposes to call them respectively the principle of exclusion and the principle of exhaustion, inasmuch as, according to the first, two contradictory terms are exclusive (the one of the other); and, according to the second, they are exhaustive (of the universe of discourse).\\" In other words, the creation of \\"contradictories\\" represents a dichotomy, i.e. the \\"splitting\\" of a universe of discourse into two classes (collections) that have the following two properties: they are (i) mutually exclusive and (ii) (collectively) exhaustive.Cf Nagel and Newman 1958:110; in their treatment they apply this dichotomy to the collection of \\"sentences\\" (formulas) generated by a logical system such as that used by Kurt G√∂del in his paper \\"On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematical and Related Systems\\". They call the two classes K1 and K2 and define logical contradiction ~S as follows: \\"A formula having the form ~S is placed in [class] K2, if S is in K1; otherwise, it is placed in K1 In other words, no one thing (drawn from the universe of discourse) can simultaneously be a member of both classes (law of non-contradiction), but [and] every single thing (in the universe of discourse) must be a member of one class or the other (law of excluded middle). Post (1921): The propositional calculus is consistent and complete As part of his PhD thesis \\"Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions\\" Emil Post proved \\"the system of elementary propositions of Principia [PM]\\" i.e. its \\"propositional calculus\\"In the introductory comments to Post 1921 written by van Heijenoort page 264, van H observes that \\"The propositional calculus, carved out of the system of Principia Mathematica, is systematically studied in itself, as a well-defined fragment of logic\\". described by PM's first 8 \\"primitive propositions\\" to be consistent. The definition of \\"consistent\\" is this: that by means of the deductive \\"system\\" at hand (its stated axioms, laws, rules) it is impossible to derive (display) both a formula S and its contradictory ~S (i.e. its logical negation) (Nagel and Newman 1958:50). To demonstrate this formally, Post had to add a primitive proposition to the 8 primitive propositions of PM, a \\"rule\\" that specified the notion of \\"substitution\\" that was missing in the original PM of 1910.In a footnote he stated \\"This operation is not explicitly stated in Principia but is pointed out to be necessary by Russell (1919, p. 151). Indeed: \\"The legitimacy of substitutions of this kind has to be insured by means of a non-formal principle of inference.1. This footnote 1 states: \\"1 No such principle is enunciated in Principia Mathematica or in M. Nicod's article mentioned above. But this would seem to be an omission\\". cf Russell 1919:151 referenced by Post 1921 in van Heijenoort 1967:267) Given PM's tiny set of \\"primitive propositions\\" and the proof of their consistency, Post then proves that this system (\\"propositional calculus\\" of PM) is complete, meaning every possible truth table can be generated in the \\"system\\": :\\". . .every truth system has a representation in the system of Principia while every complete system, that is one having all possible truth tables, is equivalent to it. . . . We thus see that complete systems are equivalent to the system of Principia not only in the truth table development but also postulationally. As other systems are in a sense degenerate forms of complete systems we can conclude that no new logical systems are introduced.\\"Post 1921 in van Heijenoort 1967:267) =A minimum set of axioms? The matter of their independence= Then there is the matter of \\"independence\\" of the axioms. In his commentary before Post 1921, van Heijenoort states that Paul Bernays solved the matter in 1918 (but published in 1926) -- the formula ‚ùã1.5 Associative Principle: p ‚ãÅ (q ‚ãÅ r) ‚äÉ q ‚ãÅ (p ‚ãÅ r) can be proved with the other four. As to what system of \\"primitive-propositions\\" is the minimum, van Heijenoort states that the matter was \\"investigated by Zylinski (1925), Post himself (1941), and Wernick (1942)\\" but van Heijenoort does not answer the question.van Heijenoort's commentary before Post 1921 in van Heijenoort:264-265 = Model theory versus proof theory: Post's proof = Kleene (1967:33) observes that \\"logic\\" can be \\"founded\\" in two ways, first as a \\"model theory\\", or second by a formal \\"proof\\" or \\"axiomatic theory\\"; \\"the two formulations, that of model theory and that of proof theory, give equivalent results\\"(Kleene 1967:33). This foundational choice, and their equivalence also applies to predicate logic (Kleene 1967:318). In his introduction to Post 1921, van Heijenoort observes that both the \\"truth-table and the axiomatic approaches are clearly presented\\".van Heijenoort:264 This matter of a proof of consistency both ways (by a model theory, by axiomatic proof theory) comes up in the more-congenial version of Post's consistency proof that can be found in Nagel and Newman 1958 in their chapter V \\"An Example of a Successful Absolute Proof of Consistency\\". In the main body of the text they use a model to achieve their consistency proof (they also state that the system is complete but do not offer a proof) (Nagel & Newman 1958:45-56). But their text promises the reader a proof that is axiomatic rather than relying on a model, and in the Appendix they deliver this proof based on the notions of a division of formulas into two classes K1 and K2 that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (Nagel & Newman 1958:109-113) G√∂del (1930): The first-order predicate calculus is complete The (restricted) \\"first-order predicate calculus\\" is the \\"system of logic\\" that adds to the propositional logic (cf Post, above) the notion of \\"subject-predicate\\" i.e. the subject x is drawn from a domain (universe) of discourse and the predicate is a logical function f(x): x as subject and f(x) as predicate (Kleene 1967:74). Although G√∂del's proof involves the same notion of \\"completeness\\" as does the proof of Post, G√∂del's proof is far more difficult; what follows is a discussion of the axiom set. = Completeness = Kurt G√∂del in his 1930 doctoral dissertation \\"The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic\\" proved that in this \\"calculus\\" (i.e. restricted predicate logic with or without equality) that every valid formula is \\"either refutable or satisfiable\\"cf introduction to G√∂del 1930 by van Heijenoort 1967:582 or what amounts to the same thing: every valid formula is provable and therefore the logic is complete. Here is G√∂del's definition of whether or not the \\"restricted functional calculus\\" is \\"complete\\": :\\". . . whether it actually suffices for the derivation of every logico-mathematical proposition, or where, perhaps, it is conceivable that there are true propositions (which may be provable by means of other principles) that cannot be derived in the system under consideration.\\"G√∂del 1930 in van Heijenoort 1967:582 =The first-order predicate calculus= This particular predicate calculus is \\"restricted to the first order\\". To the propositional calculus it adds two special symbols that symbolize the generalizations \\"for all\\" and \\"there exists (at least one)\\" that extend over the domain of discourse. The calculus requires only the first notion \\"for all\\", but typically includes both: (1) the notion \\"for all x\\" or \\"for every x\\" is symbolized in the literature as variously as (x), ‚àÄx, ‚àèx etc., and the (2) notion of \\"there exists (at least one x)\\" variously symbolized as Ex, ‚àÉx. The restriction is that the generalization \\"for all\\" applies only to the variables (objects x, y, z etc. drawn from the domain of discourse) and not to functions, in other words the calculus will permit ‚àÄxf(x) (\\"for all creatures x, x is a bird\\") but not ‚àÄf‚àÄx(f(x)) [but if \\"equality\\" is added to the calculus it will permit ‚àÄf:f(x); see below under Tarski]. Example: : Let the predicate \\"function\\" f(x) be \\"x is a mammal\\", and the subject-domain (or universe of discourse) (cf Kleene 1967:84) be the category \\"bats\\": : The formula ‚àÄxf(x) yields the truth value \\"truth\\" (read: \\"For all instances x of objects 'bats', 'x is a mammal'\\" is a truth, i.e. \\"All bats are mammals\\"); : But if the instances of x are drawn from a domain \\"winged creatures\\" then ‚àÄxf(x) yields the truth value \\"false\\" (i.e. \\"For all instances x of 'winged creatures', 'x is a mammal'\\" has a truth value of \\"falsity\\"; \\"Flying insects are mammals\\" is false); : However over the broad domain of discourse \\"all winged creatures\\" (e.g. \\"birds\\" + \\"flying insects\\" + \\"flying squirrels\\" + \\"bats\\") we can assert ‚àÉxf(x) (read: \\"There exists at least one winged creature that is a mammal'\\"; it yields a truth value of \\"truth\\" because the objects x can come from the category \\"bats\\" and perhaps \\"flying squirrels\\" (depending on how we define \\"winged\\"). But the formula yields \\"falsity\\" when the domain of discourse is restricted to \\"flying insects\\" or \\"birds\\" or both \\"insects\\" and \\"birds\\". Kleene remarks that \\"the predicate calculus (without or with equality) fully accomplishes (for first order theories) what has been conceived to be the role of logic\\" (Kleene 1967:322). =A new axiom: Aristotle's dictum ‚Äì \\"the maxim of all and none\\" = This first half of this axiom -- \\"the maxim of all\\" will appear as the first of two additional axioms in G√∂del's axiom set. The \\"dictum of Aristotle\\" (dictum de omni et nullo) is sometimes called \\"the maxim of all and none\\" but is really two \\"maxims\\" that assert: \\"What is true of all (members of the domain) is true of some (members of the domain)\\", and \\"What is not true of all (members of the domain) is true of none (of the members of the domain)\\". The \\"dictum\\" appears in Boole 1854 a couple places: :\\"It may be a question whether that formula of reasoning, which is called the dictum of Aristotle, de Omni et nullo, expresses a primary law of human reasoning or not; but it is no question that it expresses a general truth in Logic\\" (1854:4) But later he seems to argue against it:cf Boole 1854:226 ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC. CHAPTER XV. [CHAP. XV. THE ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC AND ITS MODERN EXTENSIONS, EXAMINED BY THE METHOD OF THIS TREATISE :\\"[Some principles of] general principle of an axiomatic nature, such as the \\"dictum of Aristotle:\\" Whatsoever is affirmed or denied of the genus may in the same sense be affirmed or denied of any species included under that genus. . . . either state directly, but in an abstract form, the argument which they are supposed to elucidate, and, so stating that argument, affirm its validity; or involve in their expression technical terms which, after definition, conduct us again to the same point, viz. the abstract statement of the supposed allowable forms of inference.\\" But the first half of this \\"dictum\\" (dictum de omni) is taken up by Russell and Whitehead in PM, and by Hilbert in his version (1927) of the \\"first order predicate logic\\"; his (system) includes a principle that Hilbert calls \\"Aristotle's dictum\\" He derives this and a \\"principle of the excluded middle\\" ~((x)f(x))‚Üí(Ex)~f(x) from his \\"Œµ-axiom\\" cf Hilbert 1927 \\"The Foundations of Mathematics\\", cf van Heijenoort 1967:466 :(x)f(x) ‚Üí f(y) This axiom also appears in the modern axiom set offered by Kleene (Kleene 1967:387), as his \\"‚àÄ-schema\\", one of two axioms (he calls them \\"postulates\\") required for the predicate calculus; the other being the \\"‚àÉ-schema\\" f(y) ‚äÉ ‚àÉxf(x) that reasons from the particular f(y) to the existence of at least one subject x that satisfies the predicate f(x); both of these requires adherence to a defined domain (universe) of discourse. = G√∂del's restricted predicate calculus = To supplement the four (down from five; see Post) axioms of the propositional calculus, G√∂del 1930 adds the dictum de omni as the first of two additional axioms. Both this \\"dictum\\" and the second axiom, he claims in a footnote, derive from Principia Mathematica. Indeed, PM includes both as :‚ùã10.1 ‚ä¶ ‚àÄxf(x) ‚äÉ f(y) [\\"I.e. what is true in all cases is true in any one case\\"1962 edition of PM 2nd edition 1927:139 (\\"Aristotle's dictum\\", rewritten in more-modern symbols)] :‚ùã10.2 ‚ä¶‚àÄx(p ‚ãÅ f(x)) ‚äÉ (p ‚ãÅ ‚àÄxf(x)) [rewritten in more-modern symbols] The latter asserts that the logical sum (i.e. ‚ãÅ, OR) of a simple proposition p and a predicate ‚àÄxf(x) implies the logical sum of each separately. But PM derives both of these from six primitive propositions of ‚ùã9, which in the second edition of PM is discarded and replaced with four new \\"Pp\\" (primitive principles) of ‚ùã8 (see in particular ‚ùã8.2, and Hilbert derives the first from his \\"logical Œµ-axiom\\" in his 1927 and does not mention the second. How Hilbert and G√∂del came to adopt these two as axioms is unclear. Also required are two more \\"rules\\" of detachment (\\"modus ponens\\") applicable to predicates. Tarski (1946): Leibniz's Law Alfred Tarski in his 1946 (2nd edition) \\"Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences\\" cites a number of what he deems \\"universal laws\\" of the sentential calculus, three \\"rules\\" of inference, and one fundamental law of identity (from which he derives four more laws). The traditional \\"laws of thought\\" are included in his long listing of \\"laws\\" and \\"rules\\". His treatment is, as the title of his book suggests, limited to the \\"Methodology of the Deductive Sciences\\". Rationale: In his introduction (2nd edition) he observes that what began with an application of logic to mathematics has been widened to \\"the whole of human knowledge\\": :\\"[I want to present] a clear idea of that powerful trend of contemporary thought which is concentrated about modern logic. This trend arose originally from the somewhat limited task of stabilizing the foundations of mathematics. In its present phase, however, it has much wider aims. For it seeks to create a unified conceptual apparatus which would supply a common basis for the whole of human knowledge.\\".Tarski 1946:ix, 1995 edition =Law of identity (Leibniz's Law, equality)= To add the notion of \\"equality\\" to the \\"propositional calculus\\" (this new notion not to be confused with logical equivalence symbolized by ‚Üî, ‚áÑ, \\"if and only if (iff)\\", \\"biconditional\\", etc.) Tarski (cf p54-57) symbolizes what he calls \\"Leibniz's law\\" with the symbol \\"=\\". This extends the domain (universe) of discourse and the types of functions to numbers and mathematical formulas (Kleene 1967:148ff, Tarski 1946:54ff). In a nutshell: given that \\"x has every property that y has\\", we can write \\"x = y\\", and this formula will have a truth value of \\"truth\\" or \\"falsity\\". Tarski states this Leibniz's Law as follows: * I. Leibniz' Law: x = y, if, and only if, x has every property which y has, and y has every property which x has. He then derives some other \\"laws\\" from this law: * II. Law of Reflexivity: Everything is equal to itself: x = x. [Proven at PM ‚ùã13.15] * III. Law of Symmetry: If x = y, then y = x. [Proven at PM ‚ùã13.16] * IV. Law of Transitivity: If x = y and y = z, then x = z. [Proven at PM ‚ùã13.17] * V. If x = z and y = z, then x = y. [Proven at PM ‚ùã13.172] Principia Mathematica defines the notion of equality as follows (in modern symbols); note that the generalization \\"for all\\" extends over predicate-functions f( ): :‚ùã13.01. x = y =def ‚àÄf:(f(x) ‚Üí f(y)) (\\"This definition states that x and y are to be called identical when every predicate function satisfied by x is satisfied by y\\"cf PM ‚ùã13 IDENTITY, \\"Summary of ‚ùã13\\" PM 1927 edition 1962:168 Hilbert 1927:467 adds only two axioms of equality, the first is x = x, the second is (x = y) ‚Üí ((f(x) ‚Üí f(y)); the \\"for all f\\" is missing (or implied). G√∂del 1930 defines equality similarly to PM :‚ùã13.01. Kleene 1967 adopts the two from Hilbert 1927 plus two more (Kleene 1967:387).  Contemporary developments  All of the above \\"systems of logic\\" are considered to be \\"classical\\" meaning propositions and predicate expressions are two-valued, with either the truth value \\"truth\\" or \\"falsity\\" but not both(Kleene 1967:8 and 83). While intuitionistic logic falls into the \\"classical\\" category, it objects to extending the \\"for all\\" operator to the Law of Excluded Middle; it allows instances of the \\"Law\\", but not its generalization to an infinite domain of discourse. = Intuitionistic logic = 'Intuitionistic logic', sometimes more generally called constructive logic, is a paracomplete symbolic logic that differs from classical logic by replacing the traditional concept of truth with the concept of constructive provability. The generalized law of the excluded middle is not part of the execution of intuitionistic logic, but neither is it negated. Intuitionistic logic merely forbids the use of the operation as part of what it defines as a \\"constructive proof\\", which is not the same as demonstrating it invalid (this is comparable to the use of a particular building style in which screws are forbidden and only nails are allowed; it does not necessarily disprove or even question the existence or usefulness of screws, but merely demonstrates what can be built without them). = Paraconsistent Logic = 'Paraconsistent logic' refers to so-called contradiction-tolerant logical systems in which a contradiction does not necessarily result in trivialism. In other words, the principle of explosion is not valid in such logics. Some (namely the dialetheists) argue that the law of non-contradiction is denied by dialetheic logic. They are motivated by certain paradoxes which seem to imply a limit of the law of non-contradiction, namely the Liar Paradox. In order to avoid a trivial logical system and still allow certain contradictions to be true, dialetheists will employ a paraconsistent logic of some kind. = Three-valued Logic = TBD cf Three-valued logic try this A Ternary Arithmetic and Logic - Semantic Scholar http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2010/WCE2010_pp193-196.pdf = Modal propositional calculi = (cf Kleene 1967:49): These \\"calculi\\" include the symbols ‚éïA, meaning \\"A is necessary\\" and ‚óäA meaning \\"A is possible\\". Kleene states that: :\\"These notions enter in domains of thinking where there are understood to be two different kinds of \\"truth\\", one more universal or compelling than the other . . . A zoologist might declare that it is impossible that salamanders or any other living creatures can survive fire; but possible (though untrue) that unicorns exist, and possible (though improbable) that abominable snowmen exist.\\" = Fuzzy logic = 'Fuzzy logic' is a form of many-valued logic; it deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact.

Tetanurans are defined as all theropods more closely related to modern birds than to Ceratosaurus and contain the majority of predatory dinosaur diversity. Tetanurae likely diverged from its sister group, Ceratosauria, during the late Triassic. Tetanurae first appeared in the fossil record by the Early Jurassic about 190 mya and by the Middle Jurassic had become globally distributed. The group was named by Jacques Gauthier in 1986 and originally had two main subgroups: Carnosauria and Coelurosauria, the clade containing birds and related dinosaurs such as compsognathids, tyrannosaurids, ornithomimosaurs, and maniraptorans. The original Carnosauria was a polyphyletic group including any large carnivorous theropod. Many of Gauthier's carnosaurs, such as tyrannosaurids, have since been re-classified as coelurosaurs or primitive tetanurans. Carnosauria has been reclassified as a group containing allosaurids that split from the Coelurosauria at the Neotetanurae/Avetheropoda node. Members of Spinosauroidea are believed to represent basal tetanurans. Tetanuran evolution was characterized by parallel diversification of multiple lineages, repeatedly attaining large body size and similar locomotor morphology. Cryolophosaurus has been claimed as the first true member of the group, but subsequent studies have disagreed on whether it is a dilophosaurid or tetanuran. Arcucci and Coria (2003) classified Zupaysaurus as an early tetanuran, but it was later placed as a sister taxon to the clade containing dilophosaurids, ceratosaurs, and tetanurans. Shared tetanuran features include a ribcage indicating a sophisticated air-sac-ventilated lung system similar to that in modern birds. This character would have been accompanied by an advanced circulatory system. Other tetanuran characterizing features include the absence of the fourth digit of the hand, placement of the maxillary teeth anterior to the orbit, a strap-like scapula, maxillary fenestrae, and stiffened tails. During the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, large spinosaurids and allosaurs flourished but possibly died out in the northern hemisphere before the end of the Cretaceous, and were replaced as apex predators by tyrannosauroid coelurosaurs. At least in South America, carcharodontosaurid allosaurs persisted until the end of the Mesozoic Era, and died out at the same time the non-avian coelurosaurs. Morphology Illustration of Monolophosaurus jiangi =Anatomy= Tetanurans have two basic skull morphologies. The first skull type, typical in large theropods such as Allosaurus, is common within ceratosaurs and may be primitive for tetanurans. In this type, the skull is about three times longer than tall, with a blunter snout and frequent elaborations such as horns or spikes along the lacrimals, nasals, and frontals. In the second skull type, the skull is lower and longer, with a less elaborated skull roof and a more elongated snout. Shared tetanuran features include the maxillary fenestra (an opening in the antorbital fossa), a pneumatic excavation in the jugal, and the position of the maxillary teeth anterior to the orbit. The posterior skull is little modified in tetanurans, except within Spinosauridae. In the postcranial skeleton, tetanurans transition between the most primitive theropod morphologies in basal tetanurans towards more derived, bird-like states in coelurosaurs. Most tetanurans possess specialized wrist bones, the absence or reduction of the fourth digit of the hand, a strap-like scapula, stiffened tails, and a laminar astragalar ascending process. Advanced tetanurans would have possessed a sophisticated air-sac-ventilated lung system similar to birds, and an advanced circulatory system. In megalosaurids and allosaurids, the orientation of the femoral head is anteromedial such as in ceratosaurs, but in avetheropods this orientation is fully medial. Tetanuran locomotor morphology is relatively generalized, with few variations between taxa. =Body Size= Basal tetanurans were the first theropods to achieve truly giant body sizes, with both megalosauroid and allosauroid taxa weighing over 1 ton. Sequential temporal appearances of large body size in subsequent clades suggest a pattern of size-cycles, with the extinction of incumbent giant forms allowing for replacement with a new, more bird-like theropod group that then also evolved giant body size. It is, however, possible that more than one giant tetanuran existed at a time in the same paleoenvironment, perhaps with feeding habit variations. Within most dinosaur clades, body size tended to increase over time along a lineage according to Cope's rule. Coelurosaurian theropods are the notable exception to the pattern of body size increases. History of study =History of classification= Tetanurae was recognized and named by Gauthier in 1986. The earliest-discovered tetanuran is the earliest-named dinosaur, Megalosaurus. For a century after the description of Megalosaurus, most large carnivorous dinosaurs were serially arrayed into the family Megalosauridae within the order Theropoda. In 1914, Friedrich von Huene separated small, lightly built forms into the infraorder Coelurosauria and larger taxa into the infraorder Pachypodosauria. Later, he transferred large, carnivorous taxa to the new infraorder Carnosauria, which came to include all known large-bodied carnivores other than Ceratosaurus. The size-based arrangement persisted until Gauthier, who redefined Carnosauria and Coelurosauria based on new cladistic analyses but retained the terms. Gauthier defined Coelurosauria as a taxon comprising birds and theropods closer to birds than to Carnosauria, and listed within Carnosauria several large-bodied theropod taxa but did not formally define the group. Many of these original carnosaurs have since been reclassified as coelurosaurs or primitive tetanurans, and Carnosauria has now been defined as Allosaurus and all Avetheropods closer to Allosaurus than to birds. Initial cladistics studies supported the arrangement of primitive megalosaurs as serial outgroups to a clade of allosaurids, followed by the Coelurosauria. Subsequent studies have discovered that many of these basal tetanurans formed a true clade, termed Megalosauroidea or alternatively Spinosauroidea. =Current phylogeny= Current phylogeny agrees on a monophyletic Tetanurae that includes a series of generally large-bodied basal taxa outside a monophyletic Coelurosauria. Coelophysoids are basal to Tetanurae, with Ceratosauria forming a sister taxa that diverged during the late Triassic. After their initial appearance, Tetanurae radiated into two main clades, Spinosauroidea or Megalosauroidea and Avetheropoda or Neotetanurae. Spinosauroidea are believed to represent basal Tetanurans. At the Neotetanurae/Avetheropoda node, allosaurids split from the Coelurosauria. Tyrannosauridae has been placed within Coelurosauria. The allosaurids and their closest relatives form a reconstituted Carnosauria. Debate persists about whether the allosaurids form a clade with spinosauroids/megalosauroids, and whether Allosauroidea belongs in Avetheropoda with Coelurosauria or forms a sister taxa to Megalosauroidea, and whether Megalosauroidea forms a valid clade. The cladogram presented below follows a phylogenetic analysis published by Zanno and Makovicky in 2013. In 2019, Rauhut and Pol described Asfaltovenator vialidadi, a basal allosauroid displaying a mosaic of primitive and derived features seen within Tetanurae. Their phylogenetic analysis found traditional Megalosauroidea to represent a basal grade of carnosaurs, paraphyletic with respect to Allosauroidea. Paleobiology =Biogeography= The biogeographical history of non-avian Tetanurae spans over 110 million years and all continents. The presence of major lineages prior to the breakup of Pangaea implies wide dispersal of these clades, with later absences indicating regional extinctions or dispersal failure. The density of sampling is currently insufficient to provide a detailed analysis of biogeographical evolution for the Tetanurae. =Diversity= Tetanurae and Ceratosauria likely diverged during the late Triassic, more than 200 mya. By the Early Jurassic, Tetanurae fossils appear in the fossil record and reached global distribution by the Middle Jurassic. In the Late Jurassic, the fossil record demonstrates widespread presence of multiple clades within both megalosauroids and avetheropods. The Megalosauroidea contained high diversity with two Jurassic clades, Piatnitzkysauridae and Megalosauridae, as well as the Cretaceous Spinosauridae. Tetanuran evolution appears to exhibit waves of diversification, although this may be due to uneven sampling. During the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, large spinosaurids and allosaurids flourished, but the latter possibly died out before the end of the Cretaceous due to the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, while spinosaurids are known from the Santonian. Soon afterwards the niche of terrestrial apex predator ceratosaurs and tyrannosaurid coelurosaurs, which dominated terminal Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems. Coelurosaurs persisted through the end of the Mesozoic Era. Modern birds are the only living representatives of the Tetanurae.

The key band members included Sivert H√∏yem (vocals), Robert Bur√•s (guitar) and Frode Jacobsen (bass). After Bur√•s' death on 12 July 2007, H√∏yem and Jacobsen decided to finish recording what was to be their final album. On 21 January 2008, the band released Madrugada and announced that they would split after one last tour. They performed their final concert on 15 November 2008. In June 2018 it was announced that H√∏yem, Jacobsen and Lauvland Pettersen had reformed the band for a series of shows in 2019. According to Anders Kaasen of Allmusic, the band was noted for \\"its bareboned blues-inspired alt-rock\\" at the end of the 1990s.  History  The group of musicians that would go on to become Madrugada formed in the town of Stokmarknes in 1993 under the name 'Abbeys Adoption'. The band members at this time included Jon Lauvland Pettersen (drums), Frode Jacobsen (bass), Sivert H√∏yem (vocals), and Marius 'Wah Wah' Johansen (guitar). In 1995 the band were joined by guitarist Robert Bur√•s and made the decision to move to Oslo where Johansen soon after decided to depart. By 1998 the band had been signed to a six-album deal by Virgin Music Norway and after a chance meeting with Norwegian author and poet √òystein Wingaard Wolf in an Oslo bar, changed their name to Madrugada. Their debut album Industrial Silence was released on 30 August 1999 to critical acclaim and was followed by the much darker The Nightly Disease in 2001. Both albums were toured extensively around Europe and the band built a dedicated cult following in their native Norway, Germany and especially Greece. After personal relations became fraught, Lauvland Pettersen left the band in early 2002 and was replaced with Simen Vangen. Soon afterwards, work began on the recording of their third album Grit which saw the band move towards a more raw and experimental sound. Despite this the album featured perhaps the band's most well known song in the haunting and atmospheric, 'Majesty'. The band followed the album with yet more extensive touring and a largely unsuccessful attempt to break into the UK music scene. Madrugada finished recording their fourth album The Deep End in late 2004. Recorded at Sound City in Los Angeles with producer George Drakoulias, it was released on 28 February 2005 in Norway, on 31 March in the rest of Europe and finally in the US on 11 April. Lead single \\"The Kids Are on High Street\\" was released for domestic radio play on 14 January and a music video was filmed in London. Simen Vangen announced his departure in early 2005 stating that he wished to focus on various jazz related projects, leaving the band without a permanent drummer. On 14 December 2005 Madrugada released the live album, Live at Tralfamadore, (named after the fictional home planet of aliens from several novels by the American author Kurt Vonnegut). By the end of 2005 and less than a month after its release, it became the highest selling album in Norway for that year with The Deep End as the runner-up. The year was capped off with Madrugada winning three awards at the annual Spellemannprisen ‚Äì the Norwegian equivalent of the Grammys. They won the categories for Best Rock Album, Best Song and Spellemann of the Year. Following this highly successful period, the band members focused on various side projects. Sivert H√∏yem released his second solo album Exiles in 2006 while Robert Bur√•s and his band My Midnight Creeps released their second album, the highly regarded Histamin in March, 2007. The band reconvened in the spring of 2007 with Industrial Silence, The Nightly Disease and Histamin producer John Agnello to begin work on their fifth album, but on 12 July 2007 guitarist Robert Bur√•s was found dead in his Oslo apartment. He was 31 years old. Following the release of new single \\"Look Away Lucifer\\" on 10 December 2007, their final, self-titled album was eventually released on 21 January 2008. The majority of guitar tracks had been recorded before Robert Bur√•s' death and it was very quickly decided by the remaining members to complete the record in memory of Robert. In the spring of 2008, joined on guitar by Robert's close friend and My Midnight Creeps bandmate Alex Kloster-Jensen and friend of the band Cato Thomassen, Madrugada embarked on a tour throughout Europe and Norway, playing career spanning set lists along with material from the Madrugada album and on most nights a cover of one of Robert's favourite songs. In late October 2008 their 11-date farewell tour began, and the last ever Madrugada concert was held in a sold- out Oslo Spektrum on 15 November 2008. In 2010 a career spanning double album was released entitled The Best Of Madrugada. The album included a single new track, the last ever Madrugada song entitled \\"All This Wanting To Be Free\\" whose poignant lyrics dealt with the passing of Robert. On 15 June 2018, it was announced via the band's Facebook page that they had reunited with original drummer Jon Lauvland Pettersen, announcing a 2019 European tour Eventually growing to over 60 concerts and festival appearances, it soon became their biggest ever tour to date.  Etymology  The term madrugada is Portuguese and Spanish and means early morning. The name was suggested to the band by poet/writer friend √òystein Wingaard Wolf.

In the mid-1980s he left the IRA and subsequently voluntarily surrendered to British prosecution for actions he had engaged in as an IRA gunman in the 1970s. Following his release from imprisonment, he published a memoir detailing his life in Irish Republican paramilitarism entitled The Informer: The True Life Story of One Man's War on Terrorism (1998). Former Irish Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald described O'Callaghan as one of the Irish Government's most important spies operating within the Provisional IRA during the late 20th century's The Troubles.'Sean O'Callaghan,: Former Provisional IRA Commander & Informer', obituary, 'Irish Times', 2 September 2017. https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and- style/people/sean-o-callaghan-former-provisional-ira-commander-and- informer-1.3205149 Early life O'Callaghan was born on 26 January 1954, into a family with a Fenian paramilitary history, in Tralee, County Kerry. His paternal grandfather had taken the Anti-Treaty side during the Irish Civil War, and his father had been interned by the Irish Government at the Curragh Camp in County Kildare for IRA activity during World War II.O'Callaghan (1998), pages 8-9. By the late 1960s, the teenaged O'Callaghan had ceased practising the Catholic faith, adopted atheism and had become interested in the theories of Marxist revolutionary politics, which found an outlet of practical expression in the sectarian social unrest in Northern Ireland at that time, centred on the activities of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. In 1969, an outbreak of communal violence broke out in Northern Ireland and believing that British imperialism was responsible, O'Callaghan joined the newly founded Provisional IRA at the age of 17. Soon afterwards, he was arrested by local Garda√≠ after he accidentally detonated a small amount of explosives, which caused damage to the homes of his parents and their neighbours. After demanding, and receiving, treatment as a political prisoner, O'Callaghan quietly served his sentence. Provisional Irish Republican Army activity After becoming a full-time paramilitary with the IRA, in the early to mid 1970s O'Callaghan took part in over seventy operations associated with Irish Republican political violence including bomb materials manufacture, attacks on multiple IRA targets in Northern Ireland, and robberies to provide funding for the organisation.Obituary for O'Callaghan, 'The Independent' 28 August 2017. On 2 May 1974 he was part of an attack by an IRA force on a 6th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) base at the village of Clogher in County Tyrone, with sustained automatic-rifle fire, anti-tank rockets, and rounds fired from an improvised mortar which was operated by O'Callaghan.'The Royal Irish - The Irish Soldier in Service to the Crown' website. Account of the attack on the UDR Clogher base on 2 May 1974. https://www.royal- irish.com/events/first-female-soldier-udr-pte-eva-martin-killed-ira- clogher'James Connolly, My Search for the Man, the Myth & his Legacy', by S.

London: Corgi Books. pp. 95‚Äì99; On 23 August 1974 O'Callaghan killed Detective Inspector Peter Augustine Flanagan, a 47 year old Catholic police officer and head of the Omagh Division of the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Special Branch, by shooting him repeatedly with a handgun in a two man IRA attack in a public house in the town of Omagh in County Tyrone.Photo of Peter Flanagan, Victor Patterson website (2018). https://victorpatterson.photoshelter.com/image/I0000rCF7LUZXkrEO'Callaghan, pp. 103‚Äì13 Irish Government agent within the IRA In 1976, aged 22, O'Callaghan ended his involvement with the IRA after becoming disillusioned with its activities. He later recalled that his disenchantment with the IRA began when one of his compatriots openly hoped that a female police officer who had been blown up by an IRA bomb had been pregnant so they could get \\"two for the price of one.\\" He was also concerned with what he perceived was an undercurrent of ethnic hatred in its rank and file towards the Ulster Scots population. He left Ireland and moved to London. In May 1978, he married a Scottish woman of Protestant unionist descent.O'Callaghan (1998), pp. 87‚Äì89. During the late 1970s, he ran a successful mobile cleaning business.O'Callaghan (1998), pp. 88‚Äì89. However, he was unable to fully settle in his new life, later recalling: \\"In truth there seemed to be no escaping from Ireland. At the strangest of times I would find myself reliving the events of my years in the IRA. As the years went on, I came to believe that the Provisional IRA was the greatest enemy of democracy and decency in Ireland\\".O'Callaghan (1998). In 1979 O'Callaghan was approached by the IRA seeking to recruit him again for its paramilitary campaign.O'Callaghan (1998), p. 90. In response, he decided to turncoat against the organisation and become an agent within its ranks for the Irish Government. In his memoir, O'Callaghan described his reasoning as follows: > I had been brought up to believe that you had to take responsibility for > your own actions. If you did something wrong then you made amends. I came to > believe that individuals taking responsibility for their own actions is the > basis for civilisation, without that safety net we have nothing.O'Callaghan > (1998), p. 89. O'Callaghan later told authors Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphey that he decided to become a double agent even though he knew that even those who hated the IRA as much as he now did have a low opinion of informers; as he put it, \\"there is nothing worse in Ireland than being an informer.\\" However, he felt it was the only way to stop the IRA from luring teenagers into their ranks and training them to kill. Soon after being approached by the IRA to re-join he returned to Tralee from London, where he arranged a clandestine meeting with an officer of the Garda Special Branch in a local cemetery, at which O'Callaghan expressed his willingness to work with it to subvert the IRA from within. At this point, O'Callaghan was still opposed to working with the British Government.O'Callaghan (1998), pp. 92‚Äì93. A few weeks later, O'Callaghan made contact with Kerry IRA leader Martin Ferris and attended his first IRA meeting since 1975. Immediately afterwards, he telephoned his Garda contact and said, \\"We're in\\".O'Callaghan (1998), p. 95. According to O'Callaghan, \\"Over the next few months plans to carry out various armed robberies were put together by the local IRA. It was relatively easy for me to foil these attempts; an occasional Garda car or roadblock at the 'wrong time'; the routine arrest of Ferris or myself; or simple 'bad planning', such as a car arriving late ‚Äì a whole series of random stratagems\\".O'Callaghan (1998), p. 96. During the 1981 hunger strike in the Maze Prison, he attempted to start his own hunger strike in support of the Maze prisoners but was told to desist by the IRA for fear it would detract focus from the prisoners. O'Callaghan successfully sabotaged the efforts of republicans in Kerry from staging hunger strikes of their own.O'Callaghan (1998), pp. 109‚Äì12. In 1984 he notified the Garda of an attempt to smuggle seven tons of AK-47 assault rifles from the United States to Ireland aboard a fishing trawler named Valhalla. The guns were intended for the arsenal of the Provisional IRA's units.'IRA gun-running from Boston on the Valhalla', published on Youtube 17 April 2018. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KckJIWYzpi8 The shipment had been organised by the Winter Hill Gang, an Irish-American crime family of South Boston, Massachusetts. As a result of O'Callaghan's warning, a combined force of the Irish Navy and Garda√≠ intercepted the boat that received the weaponry, and the guns were seized.\\"The IRA informer who kept Garda√≠ on track in search for Shergar\\", Irish Examiner, 20 April 2000. O'Callaghan claimed to have been tasked in 1983 by the IRA with placing 25lb of Frangex in the Dominion Theatre in London,Whitaker, James, \\"John and Norma aghast at wedding\\", Daily Mirror, 23 May 1998 to try to kill Prince Charles and Princess Diana who were due to attend a charity pop music concert there.O'Callaghan, p. 197 A warning was phoned into the Garda, and the Royal couple were hurriedly ushered from the theatre by their police bodyguard during the concert. The theatre had been searched before the concert and a second search following the warning revealed no device. In 1985, O'Callaghan was elected as a Sinn F√©in councillor for Tralee Urban District Council, and unsuccessfully contested a seat on Kerry County Council. Imprisonment After becoming disillusioned with his work with the Irish Government after the murder of another of its agents within the IRA (Sean Corcoran in County Kerry in 1985), which it had failed to prevent despite O'Callaghan's warnings of the threat to him, and sensing a growing threat to himself from the organisation which had become suspicious of his own behaviour, O'Callaghan withdrew from the IRA and left Ireland to live in England, taking his wife and children with him. His marriage ended in a divorce in 1987,Obituary for Sean O'Callaghan, 'The Independent', 28 August 2017. and on 29 November 1988 he walked into a police station in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, where, presenting himself to the officer on duty at the desk he confessed to the murder of UDR Greenfinch (female member) Eva Martin and the murder of D.I. Peter Flanagan during the mid-1970s, and voluntarily surrendered to British prosecution.O'Callaghan, pp. 307‚Äì09. Although the Royal Ulster Constabulary offered him witness protection as part of the informer policy, O'Callaghan refused it, and was prosecuted under charges of two murders and 40 other crimes, to all of which he pled guilty, committed in British jurisdiction with the IRA. Having been found guilty he was jailed for a total of 539 years. O'Callaghan served his sentence in prisons in Northern Ireland and England. While in jail, he published his story in The Sunday Times. He was released as part of a Prerogative of Mercy by Queen Elizabeth II in 1996. Post-IRA life In 1998 O'Callaghan published an autobiographical account of his experiences in Irish Republican paramilitarism, entitled The Informer: The True Life Story of One Man's War on Terrorism (1998). In the book's text he stated (shortly before the death of Eamon Collins, another former IRA member who had prominently turned upon the organisation): > I know that the organisation led by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness would > like to murder me. I know that that organisation will go on murdering other > people until they are finally defeated. It is my belief that in spite of > IRA/Sinn F√©in's strategic cunning, and no matter how many people they kill, > the people of the Irish Republic expect, because they have been told so by > John Hume, that there will be peace. There may come a time when their > patience runs out. If that were to happen there would be no place for > IRA/Sinn F√©in to hide. We must work tirelessly to bring that day > forward.O'Callaghan (1998), p. 316. O'Callaghan lived relatively openly in London for the rest of his life, having refused to adopt a new identity. He was befriended in the city by the Irish writer Ruth Dudley Edwards, and worked as a security consultant, and also occasional advisor to the Ulster Unionist Party on how to handle Irish Republicanism in general, and Sinn F√©in in particular.'Ex-informer defends RUC against critics', Newsletter (Pub. Belfast) 25 January 2007. http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/local/ex_informer_defends_ruc_against_critics_1_1842337 In 2006, O'Callaghan appeared in a London court with regard to an aggravated robbery that had occurred in which he was the victim. In 2015 O'Callaghan published James Connolly: My Search for the Man, the Myth & his Legacy (2015), a book containing a critique of the early 20th century Irish revolutionary James Connolly, and what O'Callaghan considered to be his destructive legacy in Ireland's contemporary politics.'Sean O'Callaghan, how I lost my faith in James Connolly', 'Irish Times', 25 November 2015. https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/sean-o-callaghan-how-i-lost-my-faith- in-james-connolly-1.2443428 Death O'Callaghan died by drowning after suffering a heart-attack at the age of 63 while in a swimming-pool in Kingston, Jamaica in August 2017, while visiting his daughter, Tara. His death was reported on 23 August 2017. A memorial service was held to his memory on 21 March 2018 at St Martin's in the Fields Church, in London, which was attended by representatives from Ulster Unionist parties and the Irish Government.'Son pleased at recognition of O'Callaghan for fighting terror', 'News Letter' (Pub. Belfast), 22 March 2018. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/son-pleased-at-recognition-of-o-callaghan- role-in-fighting-terror-1-8426290 Disputed claims of O'Callaghan's accounts Sources in Sinn F√©in have publicly denied aspects of the statements made by O'Callaghan with regard to his IRA career, particularly the claim that he had attained the leadership of the IRA's Southern Command, and had been a delegate to the IRA Army Council, claims O'Callaghan made both in print and before a Dublin jury under oath. A 1997 article in An Phoblacht alleged that O'Callaghan \\"has been forced to overstate his importance in the IRA, and to make increasingly outlandish accusations against individual republicans\\". O'Callaghan also claimed to have attended an IRA finance meeting in Letterkenny in 1980 with, among others, lawyer Pat Finucane and Sinn F√©in politician Gerry Adams. Following his death at the hands of Loyalist paramilitaries, Finucane's family denied that he had been a member of the IRA, and the organisation did not claim or memorialise him as a member after the event. The RUC and the Stevens Report indicated that, to their knowledge he was not believed to have been an IRA member, although he came from an Irish Republican background and three of his brothers (Dermot, John, and Seamus) had been involved in paramilitarism. Adams has repeatedly stated that, although associated closely with Irish Republican politics, he has never been a member of the IRA. While O'Callaghan claims to have quit being an informant after being disillusioned by the murder of Sean Corcoran, there remains suspicion that O'Callaghan may have been the perpetrator of Corcoran's death. O'Callaghan once claimed that the IRA had ordered him to kill Corcoran and that he did so to protect his cover, but he later repudiated this claim, stating he had only admitted to the murder to trigger a police investigation.

Minimum wage Minimum wage regulation attempts to set an hourly, or other periodic monetary standard for pay at work. A recent example was the U.K. National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Germany is currently debating whether to introduce its own. Collective bargaining Collective agreements between trade unions and employers can regulate wages of workers according to the needs of the business. Arbitration Arbitration involves makes collective agreements between trade unions and employers legally binding and mediated through a state appointed judge or magistrate. Economic labour theory An economic analysis of the law holds very simply that any intervention in a contract between two parties creates an inefficient labour market. Wages kept artificially high, by imposing any administrative or monetary costs on employers distorts the labour market equilibrium. For a national economy in a globalised world, that means jobs will go overseas and the unemployment rate rises. Major proponents of this sort of labour economics include Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago, Professor Gary Becker. Professor Becker keeps a blog with well-known academic and judge, Richard Posner. Posner is a lawyer and economist, and wrote a book called Economic Analysis of Law. His starting assumption is that unions are the cartelisation of the labour market. Both would agree, that if its aim is to improve the living standards of society, wage regulation defeats itself. Posner says, ‚ÄúEconomics is not a theory about consciousness. Behaviour is rational when it conforms to the model of rational choice, whatever the state of mind of the chooser.‚ÄùPosner, Richard, (1998) Economic Analysis of Law, 5th Edition, p.4 So any conscious attempt to improve working standards are impossible under this view.

It is owned and operated by the Norddeutscher Rundfunk public broadcasting service, but open to competitors, too. From 1934 to 1949 it used as transmission aerial a wire hung up in a tower of wood. This tower had until 1941 a height of 145 metres. In 1941 its height was reduced to 84.5 metres and in 1949 it was demolished. In 1940 a second aerial in form of a triangle area aerial was built. This aerial allowing transmitting on a wide frequency range was demolished in the Fifties. In 1949/50 a 198-metre-high guyed steelframework mast with a cage aerial and a transmission aerial for FM and TV on its top was erected. From this mast, which was partly destroyed by a storm during its erection in December 1949, between 1953 and 1962 the programme of the \\"Deutschen Langwellensender\\" (German longwave transmitter) was broadcast. This programme was transmitted in a special modulation mode, the compatible single sideband modulation, allowing smaller bandwidth and the possibility of reception with conventional AM receivers. Because this mast was under high voltage the aerials for FM and TV on its top were fed via a Goubau line. In the first half of the 1960s this aerial mast was demounted and the current installation built. It consists of: * Guyed steel tube mast for FM and TV, built in 1960. This radio mast has a diameter of 2 metres. It was 255 metres high in 1960 and grew to 300 metres in the meantime. * Guyed tubular mast radiator for mediumwave. This mast, which is 184 metres tall, is insulated against ground. It is designed as double feedable fading-reducing aerial and therefore equipped with a separation insulator in a height of 101 metres * Guyed steel tube mast with a height of 120.9 metres and a diameter of 0.7 metres. This mast was built in 1939. It stood until 1963 in Osterloog and was dismounted in this year and rebuilt in Hamburg-Billstedt. It is insulated against ground and used as back-up aerial for mediumwave. * Guyed steel framework mast with a height of 77 metres insulated against ground. This mast built in 1979 is used as reflector mast for the 184-metre-high medium wave transmission mast. Its construction was necessary because of the conditions of the waveplan of Geneva. Since 1967, the University of Hamburg has been using the 304 m-mast as a six-level meteorological measurement platform, with thermometers, hygrometers, and anemometers mounted at various heights up to 280 m above ground. The atmospheric variables are sampled at a high temporal resolution to allow computation of boundary layer turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum. Live data and time series are also made available via the World Wide Web. Hamburg's Light Miracle In 1934, shortly after the inauguration of the facility, some owners of recreational gardens discovered that a light bulb connected to ground and a highly spun wire made the bulb light up brightly enough to illuminate a small house. Later many other did so. Transmission energy is taken from the transmitter, and induces electrical power in the wire. This effect was not discovered immediately. Later, technicians of the transmitter noticed, that in the houses of nearby gardens, lights went on and off depending on whether the transmitter was switched on or off. This phenomenon got the nickname \\"Hamburger Lichtwunder\\" (German: \\"Hamburg's light miracle\\"). After this was discovered, use of transmitting energy of radio transmitters for other purposes than radio reception was prohibited in Germany by law. technic3d.com, Literature \\"Wunder der Wellen\\", Author: Eduard Rhein See also *List of masts *List of towers References External links =Radio transmitter=   * http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b45492 * http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b45494 * http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b45495 * http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b60444 * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=60443 * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=47079 * Google Maps: Main Transmission Mast =Meteorological observatory= * https://web.archive.org/web/20060630195430/http://wettermast-hamburg.zmaw.de/ your bitcoinCategory:Norddeutscher Rundfunk Category:Buildings and structures in Hamburg-Mitte Category:Radio masts and towers in Germany Category:Meteorological stations ","title":"Transmitter Hamburg-Billstedt"},{"id":"1252388","text":"Dr. Jeffery L.

Career Briggs holds a Doctorate in Musical Composition and Theory from the University of Illinois. Briggs' composition teachers included Samuel Adler, Warren Benson, Joseph Schwantner, Donald Freund, and John Melby. His career began in New York City where he composed music for various events, including dance and theater groups. He took a job as game editor and designer at West End Games where he worked until 1987. He then joined MicroProse Software, where he served as designer, writer, composer and producer, becoming the company's Executive Producer and, finally, its Director of Product Development. Briggs's music first appeared in a 1989 MicroProse release Sword of the Samurai. Following that, most MicroProse games featured his work. Before working in software entertainment, Briggs' music had already received performances by ensembles internationally in Paris' Pompidou Centre (\\"Ecliptic\\"), New York City's Avery Fisher Hall (\\"Comets\\"), and in the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts in Illinois (\\"Adjectives,\\" \\"Firaxis\\", \\"Chimera,\\" \\"Aurora,\\" and others) as well as various smaller venues in New York and other cities throughout the United States.

It operated from 1921 until 1971. From 1921 to 1965 a section served Memphis, Tennessee via Bowling Green, Kentucky. The Pan-American was the L&N;'s flagship train until the introduction of the Humming Bird in 1946. Its name honored the substantial traffic the L&N; carried to and from the seaports on the Gulf of Mexico. The Pan-American was one of many trains discontinued when Amtrak began operations in 1971.  History  The L&N; introduced the Pan- American on December 5, 1921. A section of the train diverged at Bowling Green, Kentucky to serve Memphis, Tennessee. At the outset the train carried both sleepers and coaches, and was noteworthy for its all-steel construction in an era when wood heavyweight coaches were still common. The name honored the substantial traffic the L&N; carried to and from the seaports on the Gulf of Mexico. It covered the from Cincinnati to New Orleans in 26 hours, soon shortened to exactly 24 hours. The train proved popular with the traveling public, and in 1925 was re-equipped as an \\"All-Pullman\\" (no coaches) train. Its popularity contributed to businesses named after it; the Pan-American Lunch Room operated in Nashville, Tennessee in the 1920s.[https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/2469/13399408?pid=1373584605&backurl;=https://search.ancestry.com/cgi- bin/sse.dll?indiv%3D1%26dbid%3D2469%26h%3D1373584605%26tid%3D82991240%26pid%3D382070537565%26hid%3D1041385891937%26usePUB%3Dtrue%26_phsrc%3DIAO2307%26_phstart%3Ddefault%26usePUBJs%3Dtrue&treeid;=82991240&personid;=382070537565&hintid;=1041385891937&usePUB;=true&_phsrc=IAO2307&_phstart=default&usePUBJs;=true Pan-American Lunch Room, 2620 Jefferson, Nashville, TN City Directory, 1929 The economic pressures of the Great Depression forced the Pan-American to start carrying coaches again in 1933. Like many L&N; trains, the Pan-American experienced a surge in ridership during World War II, carrying four times its normal traffic. The Pan-American lost its title as the L&N;'s flagship train in 1946 with the introduction of faster Humming Bird over the same route. Although never fully streamlined, the Pan-American began receiving streamlined equipment in 1949. The southbound Pan-American carried through sleepers for Nashville, Tennessee, Louisville, Kentucky and Memphis from New York City conveyed by the Pennsylvania Railroad in Cincinnati. Further south in Montgomery, Alabama it received New York-New Orleans and Washington-New Orleans sleepers from the Southern Railway's Piedmont Limited. In 1953 the Pan-American was one of several L&N; trains to receive new lightweight \\"Pine\\"-series sleeping cars from Pullman-Standard. Throughout the 1960s, the decline of passenger railroading in the United States took its toll on ridership and amenities. A counter-lounge replaced the diner-lounge in 1965. The Pan-American began handling some of the South Wind's through traffic in 1970 after the Penn Central withdrew from joint operation. By 1970 the train's consist had shrunk dramatically: between Cincinnati and Louisville it might carry only a baggage car, coach, and dining car, with a sleeper for New Orleans added in Louisville. Amtrak did not retain service over the L&N; route, and the Pan-American ended on April 30, 1971.  Cultural influence  Postcard of the Pan-American as it passed the WSM transmitter in Nashville. In the words of Kincaid Herr, official historian of the L&N;, the Pan-American \\"came to be the symbol of the L&N;'s passenger service.\\" The train was made famous by WSM Radio's nightly broadcast of the passing train's whistle. Some Pan-American passengers were lucky enough to sit in comfortable lounge chairs and hear the sound of their own train's whistle from a wood-cabinet table radio tuned to WSM in the observation car. The broadcasts began on August 15, 1933. The Pan-American inspired several songs: * \\"Pan-American Blues\\" (1926) by DeFord Bailey * \\"The Pan-American\\" (1948) by Hank Williams * \\"Pan-American Boogie\\" (1949) by the Delmore Brothers \\"Pan-American Blues\\" was one of two railroad songs recorded by DeFord Bailey (the other being \\"Dixie Flyer Blues\\", so named for another L&N; train. Bailey saw the Pan-American frequently at Nashville's Union Station in the 1920s, but the inspiration for name came from one of his foster sisters, who noted that \\"it was the fastest around.\\" Bailey, with his harmonica, imitated the sound of the Pan-American's whistle and it quickly became one of his most-requested performances at the Grand Ole Opry and elsewhere.

It owned and operated a between Port Saint Joe, Florida, and Chattahoochee, Florida, with a short spur to Apalachicola, Florida. It was founded in 1903 and ceased operating in 2002 when the St. Joe Company, its corporate parent, leased its line to the AN Railway.  History  The company was chartered on April 7, 1903. Construction began on March 21, 1905, and trains began running north from Apalachicola in 1907. The extension to Port St. Joe was completed on May 10, 1910. The company operated in receivership on three separate occasions: July 1907 to October 1908, May 1914 to February 1916 and May 1932 to December 1936. The company came under ownership of Alfred I. du Pont in 1933, along with the entire town of Port St. Joe. The railroad's largest customer, the St. Joe Paper Company mill in Port St. Joe, was owned by the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust from 1936 to 1996.Humanities & Social Sciences Online: Green Empire: The St. Joe Company and the Remaking of Florida's Panhandle by Kathryn Ziewitz and June Wiaz-2004 On September 30, 1940, Edward Ball, who managed the du Pont trust properties, transferred control of the railroad to the St. Joe Paper Company. When the paper company was sold in 1996, ownership of the railroad was returned to the St. Joe Company. AN Railway, a subsidiary of the Rail Management Corporation leased line from the St. Joe Company on September 1, 2002 and acquired the railroad's locomotives, rolling stock, and railroad equipment. From that date the Apalachicola Northern ceased to operate as a railroad. The St. Joe Company continues to own the physical line.

On the night of 1942, the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade (part of the 7th Motor Brigade), with thirteen 6-pounder anti-tank guns and the 239th Battery, 76th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, with six more 6-pounders, was ordered to occupy a desert feature known as Snipe, a small depression in the landscape south-west of Kidney Ridge that was suitable for an outpost. Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade defeated numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery- bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed. Background =Operation Lightfoot= The Second Battle of El Alamein began with Operation Lightfoot, an Eighth Army plan for the main attack to be made in the north by XXX Corps (Lieutenant-General Willoughby Norrie) and a secondary attack in the south by XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese), with X Corps (Lieutenant-General Herbert Lumsden) standing by to exploit success. Montgomery intended that two corridors were to be cut through the Axis minefields opposite the XXX Corps area. One corridor was to run south-west through the 2nd New Zealand Division (Lieutenant-General Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg) sector, towards the centre of Miteirya Ridge and the second was to run westwards, passing north of the west end of Miteirya Ridge and straddling the areas of the 9th Australian Division and the 51st (Highland) Division. Tanks would pass through the gaps and defeat the German armoured divisions. Diversions at Ruweisat Ridge in the centre and in the south were intended to convince the Axis that the main British effort would be in the south and the 10th Armoured Division moved behind XIII Corps to add to the impression. In the north, four infantry divisions of XXX Corps were to advance on a front to the Oxalic Line, an objective beyond the forward Axis outposts. Engineers would then clear and mark the two lanes through the minefields and the armoured divisions of X Corps would pass through to gain the Pierson Line. The tanks would consolidate just west of the infantry positions, to intercept any armoured counter-attack against the infantry. The tanks would then advance to the next objective, Skinflint, deep inside the Axis defences and astride the Rahman track to confront the Axis tanks. The Eighth Army infantry would continue to \\"crumble\\" the three lines of Axis fortifications and destroy any tanks that attacked them. Prelude =2nd Rifle Brigade= The 2nd Rifle Brigade (Lieutenant-Colonel Victor Turner) was one of two battalions in the 7th Motor Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division. The motor battalions did not have four rifle companies and various support platoons, like normal infantry battalions. The 2nd Rifle Brigade had an establishment of an anti-tank company of sixteen 6-pounder anti-tank guns, three rifle companies, a scout platoon riding on eleven Bren Gun Carriers, a platoon of 3-inch mortars and a machine- gun platoon with Vickers medium machine-guns, a scale of equipment which could generate much more fire power than a normal infantry battalion. Losses during Operation Lightfoot had reduced the battalion to carriers and who had been reinforced by two troops of the 239th Battery, 76th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, with six more 6-pounders and from the 7th Field Squadron, which brought the battalion up to about =Operation Supercharge= The course of Operation Lightfoot led Rommel to commit the 90th Light Division from reserve to the north of the front. The move of the division in the coastal sector suggested that Rommel expected the next Eighth Army attack there. Montgomery planned Operation Supercharge, an attack on a front south of Point 29, for the night of as soon as the Eighth Army had completed a reorganisation to create reserves for the attack. To keep Axis attention on the coastal sector, Montgomery ordered the renewal of the 9th Australian Division attacks on the night of as the rest of the infantry of XXX Corps consolidated the new line and tanks covered the Australian left flank. The Australian positions were taken over by a brigade of the 51st (Highland) Division and to the south, the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn and replaced with the 1st South African Division by extending its right flank, as the 4th Indian Division further south did the same. In XIII Corps, the 7th Armoured Division was to conserve its strength, ready to move towards the coast as soon as the 21st Panzer Division was known to have moved north. Major-General Raymond Briggs, the 1st Armoured Division commander, continued attempts to push forward the tanks to act as a shield for the infantry, by creating a firm base, despite the congestion caused by the division being superimposed on the 51st (Highland) Division. Arguments between the tank and infantry commanders as to the position of the front line had bedevilled co- operation, with the tank commanders insisting that their units were much further forward than the infantry commanders believed. The Eighth Army headquarters decided to end the bickering by having the troops light flares, which would be mapped from several locations to triangulate their positions but this took place too late to affect the operation. Two battalions of the 7th Motor Brigade (Brigadier Thomas Bosville) were to advance either side of Kidney Ridge and occupy ground from which Axis anti-tank emplacements could be dominated and create a path for the 2nd and 24th Armoured brigades to advance. Woodcock was north-west and Snipe the same distance south-west of the ridge. Arguments about the location of infantry and tank units after Operation Lightfoot had not been resolved by a reconnaissance during the morning, as the flare-firing exercise had not begun, which left Turner in doubt about the battalion start line and the position of the objective. After the flares had been lit the confusion persisted, because the tanks units refused to accept the evidence that their map reading was even worse than that of the infantry. Late on 26 October, Turner referred this to the 7th Motor Brigade headquarters, who replied that it was too late to change plans. Turner ordered the battalion to follow the creeping barrage, which began at on a bearing of 270¬∞, rather than the 233¬∞ given by the battalion navigator, which delayed the infantry for ten minutes as they reassembled to follow it. The battalion passed through the 5th Black Watch and then the 1st Gordon Highlanders by on the morning of 27 October. Battle =26 October= The 2nd Rifle Brigade advanced on the new bearing at and met little opposition apart from dust, which lay deep in the lanes through the minefields, for the first and then came upon barbed wire, which turned out to line a dummy minefield. Over the next , the battalion took twenty prisoners, scattered several parties of Axis infantry and moved for about beyond a ridge, to what was thought to be Snipe, after a smoke shell was fired to mark the position by the British artillery. It was a similar depression to Snipe with an abandoned German engineer store, about south-east of the objective. Turner ordered the battalion to dig in at and fired the rocket signal for the heavier weapons to be brought forward. The lorries and Chevrolet carrying the anti-tank guns, encountered long sandy ridges which slowed the journey but nineteen of the twenty-seven 6-pounders and the ammunition were unloaded and dug in by The guns in small dips had cover and were on soft sand, which could be excavated; the five guns of B Company were dug in to the south-east, facing from C Company had four guns which were to the south-west, covering the angles from and A Company had four guns facing north-west and north. Six guns of 239/76th Anti-Tank Battery faced north and north east. The C Company carrier platoon patrolled to the west and found about ready to surrender but before infantry arrived to collect them, the platoon ran into a laager of about tanks (XII Armoured Battalion from the 133rd Armoured Division \\"Littorio\\") and German tanks, (tank destroyers) and infantry (). The British opened fire and set three lorries on fire but lost a carrier while withdrawing. Most of the prisoners ran away but from Pioneer Battalion 220 of the 164th Light Afrika Division Pioneer Battalion 33 of the 15th Panzer Division. Camp fires showed that another laager with tanks of the 15th Panzer Division was to the north. broke camp and formed two columns, one moving towards the laager to the north and one straight towards the south-west part of Outpost Snipe, where C and B companies were placing their anti-tank guns. The column was led by a Panzer IV Special, which was knocked out and set on fire by a C Company 6-pounder at range, as A Company hit a , the column turning aside. The British Forward Observation Officer (FOO) went out to reconnoitre at and disappeared. Just before dawn, the lorries returned to the east with the prisoners. The depression and scrub were good cover and the infantry, some of whom had been in the desert since 1940, dug in deep. =27 October= Morning When dawn broke the battalion found that it was in scrubby desert, deployed in a north-east to south-west oval, about long and wide. As movement was seen in the German laager, the gun-crews in the north- west face of Outpost Snipe prepared to receive an attack but the German tanks moved westwards, away from the front line, which exposed them broadside to the British guns. The gunners opened fire and for thirty minutes the north end of the outpost disappeared in smoke, flying sand and explosions as Axis artillery and tanks replied to the anti-tank fire, until the tanks were out of range. Part of had spent the night in a dip, reappeared to the south-west of Snipe and also moved with their sides exposed to the British 6-pounders. The gunners claimed six German, eight Italian tanks and two self-propelled guns destroyed and two tanks damaged, for the loss of three anti-tank guns knocked out and one sunk into the sand. Axis return fire caused several casualties and daylight showed that some of the guns were too exposed and needed to be re- sited. The armoured brigades had been intended to join the parties at Snipe and Woodcock but the failure at Woodcock caused confusion and hesitation among the British tank units. The 47th Royal Tank Regiment (47th RTR) of the 24th Armoured Brigade, was under command of the 10th Armoured Division and drove over a ridge at saw a post surrounded by German tanks beyond, assumed it was a German laager and opened fire. Turner sent an officer back in a Bren Gun Carrier, who managed to get the most advanced tanks to stop after thirty minutes but the rest kept firing. As the British tanks moved forward, the Rifle Brigade gunners at the south end of Snipe saw about tanks with long- barrelled guns (Panzer III or Panzer IV Specials), heading behind a ridge away to ambush the British tanks. The German tanks were broadside on again and the British gunners immediately hit and set three more on fire; the 47th RTR machine-gunned the crews as they tried to escape. By the 47th RTR had arrived at Snipe, which attracted a storm of artillery-fire and the outpost disappeared again in smoke, fire, explosions and flying sand. German tanks fired smoke shells at the British tanks and then anti-tank and tank gunners aimed at the smoke, which was much easier to see than the camouflaged vehicles. Soon the 47th RTR was down to five Shermans and six Crusaders and at the tanks were ordered to retire with the 41st RTR, which had lost another twelve tanks, ending a plan for the 24th Armoured Brigade to pivot to the south of Outpost Snipe into open ground. As the tanks moved, they were engaged from about to the north, by tanks and anti-tank guns; a British gunner was persuaded to open fire despite the range and knocked out a Panzer IV, for a loss of two 6-pounders. The battalion Medical Officer and the ambulances had been left behind at the start line on 26 October and had been unable to move forward in daylight; the loss of the FOO during the night, made it impossible to direct plunging fire on the Axis artillery and tanks hidden in dips around the post. Much of the British artillery-fire fell around the outpost instead, until the 2nd Rifle Brigade managed to stop the guns at . The outpost was also running short of ammunition and three carriers were loaded with the most badly wounded men, dashed for the ridge to the east and reached safety. The battalion ambulances and supply lorries were behind the ridge ready to move, along with a replacement FOO but nothing could make the return journey through the Axis artillery and machine-gun fire, which began as soon as a vehicle appeared above the crest. Around Italian infantry were seen assembling opposite the western face of the outpost and carriers from a scout platoon sallied from the post to disperse them, inflicting many casualties and destroying two vehicles towing captured 6-pounders. Two anti-tank guns were moved to the south-west perimeter from the north, despite the Bren Gun Carriers not having towing attachments and dust thrown up by the move being shelled by Axis artillery, which killed four men. Just as the guns were readied, thirteen Italian M13/40 tanks from the XIII Battalion appeared over the ridge to the west and about twenty German tanks of used the attack as cover to advance from the hull-down ambush position to counter-attack the 24th Armoured Brigade, which had retired to similar positions behind the ridge to the east. The anti-tank guns along the western flank of Snipe opened fire and hit four Italian tanks at once, causing the rest to return to cover. The German tanks came into the open and exposed their sides to the Rifle Brigade gunners and then half of the German tanks turned towards the outpost to suppress the fire from the anti-tank guns, only to present their sides to the British tanks behind the ridge. The gunners at Snipe and the tank gunners ignored the vehicles heading towards them and concentrated on those which were broadside on. Eight German tanks were set on fire, several more began attempts to tow them away and the rest retreated. Afternoon Conditions inside Snipe worsened in the midday heat as the number of casualties increased, with little more than shell-dressings and water to tend them. Just before noon, six Bren Gun Carriers were hit and caught fire; the heat and smoke drifting over the guns making the visibility even worse. Many of the gunners were among the casualties and guns were kept in action with improvised crews and by men moving from one to the other. Only thirteen guns were still operational to cover the perimeter and the guns along the south-west face became so short of ammunition that two men drove Jeeps back and forth to share out the remainder. Three of the remaining carriers took out more wounded but one was knocked out during the journey and at Axis artillery and machine-gun fire increased. Eight Italian M13/40s, a self-propelled gun and infantry appeared over a ridge to the south-west, where only one 6-pounder was still in action. Turner and another officer joined the sergeant in command of the gun and waited until the tanks were within , then knocked out five tanks and the self-propelled gun before the Italians had closed the range to . With only two rounds left and the last three M13/40s pressing on, Lieutenant Toms left the gun to drive a Jeep to the nearest knocked-out gun for ammunition and arrived back at the gun through machine-gun fire, which set the Jeep petrol tank alight. Turner and an NCO rushed over to help unload the Jeep, by when the tanks were away, firing machine-guns at the gun crew. Sergeant Calistan, the gun-layer, hit the three tanks and set them on fire, from which none of the crews escaped. After the attack there was a lull, apart from shelling which caused more casualties. Turner had been wounded unloading the Jeep but visited the gun positions until the effects of his wounds became too serious; by most of the officers were casualties and the guns were commanded by wounded NCOs. Briggs ordered forward the 2nd Armoured Brigade artillery, the 11th RHA and they drove their M7 Priests up the east side of the ridge to bombard Axis positions but managed only to hit Snipe again with 105 mm howitzer fire. Rommel could see the fighting around Snipe from his headquarters and assembled the 90th Light Division and the 21st Panzer Division, which had been moved to the northern area of the battlefield overnight, with parts of the 15th Panzer Division, the 164th Light Afrika Division and a battlegroup of the 132nd Armoured Division \\"Ariete\\". About tanks and self-propelled guns in two waves, about west of Outpost Snipe, were to attack the British tanks beyond the ridge to the east, after a five-minute bombardment and a Junkers Ju 87 attack. As the formation of twenty , escorted by twenty Fiat CR.42s and twenty Bf 109s approached, it was intercepted by sixteen Curtiss P-40s of the 64th Fighter Squadron and the 65th Fighter Squadron, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), which claimed six Axis fighters. The Axis formation was then attacked by of 33 Squadron and 213 Squadron RAF, which claimed two , four CR-42s and three Bf 109s for a loss of three Hurricanes. Part of the Axis tank force advanced against Australian positions near Point 29 to the north of Snipe; to the south about thirty German and ten Italian tanks advanced towards part of the 2nd Armoured Brigade. The force in the north was deluged by artillery-fire and then dispersed by bombing and the southern force passed by the 239th Battery, with seven of the tanks only away. The anti-tank gunners knocked out nine tanks, damaged several and a 6-pounder crew from A Company claimed four more, after which the tanks withdrew to low ground near Kidney Ridge. The second wave of tanks attacked and fifteen Panzer IIIs turned towards the north-west perimeter of Snipe, where only two guns were operational. A third gun was hauled round in time to join in but there were only thirty armour-piercing rounds left. The tanks advanced cautiously along routes with cover and machine-gunned the 6-pounders as they came into view, driving the crews into slit trenches. When three tanks were away, a sergeant crawled to one of the guns and operated it alone, hitting the leading tank twice, despite the machine-gun fire, then knocked out the next two, the third tank being hit by a shot which went through the second tank. The third tank drove into cover, about back, where the rest of the force rallied, less six tanks knocked out. The tanks machine- gunned the position, without exposing themselves to return fire from the anti- tank guns, for the rest of the day. About seventy Axis armoured vehicles littered the area and the 2nd Rifle Brigade had lost sixteen Bren Gun Carriers and ten 6-pounders, with another five damaged; at a signal was sent to the 7th Motor Brigade about the tanks; reinforcements were promised but no armoured counter-attack was made. The 2nd Rifle Brigade burnt their codes and soon after, the light began to fade; at the German tanks drove to the north-east where some were silhouetted and the British fired their last anti-tank ammunition, hitting one tank. Survivors from the posts around the perimeter began to move towards the command post, dragging wounded with them, under streams of bullets from Axis machine-guns being fired horizontally across the outpost. =28 October= After checking the 6-pounders to make sure they were incapable of firing, the last unwounded troops prepared for the relief but no sign of a relief party or the battalion transport appeared and at the survivors of A and C companies withdrew with one 6-pounder, which was carried out on a damaged Chevrolet ; as both sides were out rescuing wounded and the party was not fired on. British artillery opened fire soon after the retirement began and bombarded accurately the area around Outpost Snipe for the first time, which led to German tanks moving from their laagers straight towards the outpost, at which, the battalion HQ with the remaining men retired for on foot and under fire. A relief force of the 5th Royal Sussex from the fresh 133rd Lorried Infantry Brigade (Brigadier A. W. Lee) had set out when the brigade began to take over from the 7th Motor Brigade and the British bombardment had been fired as the 5th Royal Sussex advanced. As the 2nd Rifle Brigade had retired they had passed unseen by the relieving battalion, which dug in before dawn about south-east of Outpost Snipe. Aftermath =Analysis= The 2nd Rifle Brigade showed that with powerful anti-tank guns, dug in on well-chosen positions, British infantry could inflict disproportionate losses on tanks, knocking out German tanks at . Co-operation between the Rifle Brigade gunners and the tank gunners of the 24th Armoured Brigade on 27 October had been excellent but the imminence of Operation Supercharge and the fate of the tanks which reached Snipe on 27 October, left Briggs reluctant to risk more tanks. The attempt of the 1st Armoured Division to provide artillery support backfired, due to the chronic inability of the British commanders to agree where their units were (even after the location exercise with flares). Rommel had ordered a counter-attack by the reserve, to restore the original German positions on a front from El Wishka in the south to Point 29 in the north, which had been lost during Operation Lightfoot. Outpost Snipe was behind the German front line, across the route of the right flank of the counter-attack of 27 October; Rommel wrote later of the \\"murderous fire\\", which \\"struck into our ranks\\" and stopped the biggest Axis counter-attack against XXX Corps; an armoured attack on ground where the defender had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed. =Casualties= The 2nd Rifle Brigade suffered but a month later, a committee of investigation concluded that the battalion had managed to knock out 52 to 57 Axis vehicles, of which and tanks had been destroyed, along with five self-propelled guns; Axis human losses were unknown but believed to be more than the Rifle Brigade losses. In 2001, Barrie Pitt gave and self-propelled guns destroyed, plus an unknown number of armoured vehicles which had been recovered and in 2003 John Latimer recorded and tanks. In 1978, Matthew Cooper wrote that on 26 October, the fourth day of Operation Lightfoot, the tank strength of the had fallen from and on 27 October had been reduced to tanks. =Victoria Cross= Lieutenant-Colonel Victor Turner was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the battle.

The defensive force usually takes very heavy casualties or is completely destroyed. Troops may make a last stand due to a perceived duty; because they are defending a tactically crucial point; to buy time to enable a trapped army to escape; due to fear of execution if captured; or to protect their ruler or leader. Last stands loom large in history, as the heroism and sacrifice of the defenders exert a large pull on the public's imagination. Some last stands have become a celebrated part of a fighting force's or a country's history, especially if the defenders accomplished their goals (or in rare cases, defeated their attackers). Tactical significance A \\"last stand\\" is a last resort tactic, and is chosen because the defending force realizes or believes the benefits of fighting outweigh the benefits of retreat or surrender. This usually arises from strategic or moral considerations, such as staying and fighting to buy time for wounded soldiers or civilians to get to a safe place, leading defenders to conclude that their sacrifice is essential to the greater success of their campaign or cause, as happened at the end of the Battle of Saragarhi.Hamm, Jean Shepherd. Term Paper Resource Guide to Medieval History. Greenwood (November 25, 2009). pp. 88-90. The situation can arise in several ways. One situation is that retreat by the defending force would lead to immediate defeat, usually due to the surrounding geography or shortage of supplies or support, as happened to the Royalist infantry on Wadborough Hill after the Battle of Naseby.David Plant 1645: The Storming of Leicester and the Battle of Naseby, www.british-civil-wars.co.uk, Retrieved 2009-05-24Martin Marix Evans, Graham Turner.

The Shangani Patrol -- The last stand of Major Allan Wilson, Matabeleland, 4 December 1893. Some military thinkers have cautioned against putting an opposing force into a last stand situation, recognising that trapped men will fight harder. Sun Tzu wrote: \\"To a surrounded enemy, you must leave a way of escape\\". Similarly, they have sometimes suggested deliberately putting their own forces in such a situation, for example by burning boats or bridges that could tempt them to retreat. The historian Bryan Perrett suggests that although the majority of last stands throughout history have seen the defending force overwhelmed, on rare occasions the outnumbered defenders succeed in their desperate endeavours and live to fight another day, and he lists the Battle of Agincourt and the Battle of Rorke's Drift as such engagements.Bryan Perrett. Last Stand!: Famous Battles Against the Odds. p. 9 =Fear of execution= Troops may fight a last stand if they believe that they will be executed if they surrender. In Custer's last stand, at the end of the battle, the extent of the soldiers' resistance to the Lakota and Cheyenne warriors indicated they had few doubts about their prospects for survival if they surrendered. In the end, the hilltop where George Armstrong Custer's remaining troops made their last stand made it impossible for Custer's men to secure a defensive position. Nevertheless, the soldiers put up their most dogged defence, and died fighting. During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, by the end of 1942, the Jews trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto learned that the deportations were part of an extermination process, as the deportees were sent to death camps. Many of the remaining Jews decided to revolt. The first armed resistance in the ghetto occurred in January 1943. On 19 April 1943, Passover eve, the Nazis entered the ghetto. The remaining Jews knew that the Nazis would murder them all and they decided to resist the Nazis to the last, rather than surrender. SFC Randy Shughart (left) and MSG Gary Gordon (right) Another example of a famous last stand was during the First Battle of Mogadishu, where two US 1st SFOD-D snipers, MSG Gary Gordon and SFC Randy Shughart, protected the crash site of helicopter 'Super 6-4' and injured pilot Mike Durant, whom they feared would be executed by a crowd of deadly rioters. The two snipers killed 25 and wounded dozens more before they ran out of ammunition and were killed. Their defense, however, allowed Mike Durant to survive long enough for one of the local warlords to take him prisoner. The US was ultimately able to arrange for his release and he was returned home. For their actions, MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. =Protecting leader= In some cases, troops will make a last stand to protect their ruler or leader or commander. In the Battle of Hastings in 1066, Saxon King Harold II battled the Norman William the Conqueror, who invaded with 7,000 men. After most of the Saxons were killed in the battle, \\"Harold and his housecarl bodyguard...fought on until an arrow struck the king in the eye.\\" After Harold died, the housecarl bodyguard made a last stand and \\"...fought to the death around the body of their dead king.\\" When Rome was attacked in 1527 by the army of the Holy Roman Empire under Emperor Charles V, over 20,000 troops stormed the city. The 189 Swiss Guards made a last stand against the massive army by forming a square around St. Peter's Basilica to give Pope Clement VII time to escape through secret tunnels, and held the doors until Clement could escape. At the 1795 battle of Krtsanisi, where the Persian army led by Agha Muhammad Khan defeated the Georgians, the Three Hundred Aragvians ‚Äì a detachment of the highlanders from the Aragvi valley ‚Äì loyally fought and died in order to enable the escape of King Heraclius II, for which they are remembered as national heroes and were canonized by the Georgian Church. The Battle of Pavan Khind involved a rearguard last stand. It took place on July 13, 1660 at a mountain pass in the vicinity of fort Vishalgad, near the city of Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India between the Maratha Warrior Baji Prabhu Deshpande and Siddi Masud of Adilshah Sultanate. 300 Marathas in a rearguard action, held off an attacking force of 10,000 Adilshahis, allowing their King to escape to a nearby fort. Ultimately the battle ended with the destruction of the rearguard Maratha forces, and a tactical victory for the Bijapur Sultanate, but failed to achieve its strategic objective of capturing the Maratha king, Shivaji. =Defending tactically crucial point= During the second Persian invasion of Greece the Greeks hoped to use the narrow pass of Thermopylae to prevent the vastly large army of the Persians from outflanking them. A Greek force of 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The Persian army, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000, arrived at the pass in late August or early September. During the Battle of Thermopylae, the vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. When Leonidas became aware that his force was being outflanked, he dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, fighting to the death. Although the Greeks lost the battle, it did check the advance of the Persian army and the delay helped the Greeks prepare a successful defence and ultimately win the war. =Buying time= Sometimes, rather than face annihilation at the hands of a pursuing victorious army, a rearguard will be tasked by the commander of the defeated army with hindering the advance of the victorious army. Even if the rearguard is destroyed in a last stand, its sacrifice may buy their commander time to disengage without losing the majority of his army as happened during the Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778), and the Dunkirk evacuation (1940, in World War II).John Harris, Dunkirk: \\"the storms of war\\", David & Charles, 1980, , . p.8 \\"Dunkirk was a military operation also ‚Äî a hard-fought retreat with a magnificent last stand by the rearguard to allow the bulk of the troops to get [away]\\" =Perceived duty= A last stand may also be the last pitched battle of a war where the position of the defending force is hopeless but the defending force considers it their duty not to surrender until forced to do so, as happened to the last Royalist field army of the First English Civil War at the Battle of Stow-on-the- Wold.Sidney Low, et al., The dictionary of English history, Cassell and company, 1928. \\"At the battle of Naseby Astley commanded the infantry, and in 1646 he made a last stand at Stow-on-the-Wold against the Parliament.\\" At the Battle of Saragarhi, the British Indian contingent consisting of 21 Sikh soldiers of the 36th Sikhs, when faced with insurmountable opposition of 10,000 Afghans, decided to make a last stand in accordance with their traditional and religious belief that duty is above all convictions. All 21 Sikhs were killed, together with approximately 600 Afghans. At the end of a siege Before the 20th century, \\"no quarter was given\\" if a besieged garrison had refused any offered terms of surrender prior to the attackers breaching the defences, so a last stand was part of the end of many sieges, such as the Battle of the Alamo. However, since the 1907 IV Hague Convention it is unlawful for an attacking force to kill a garrison if they attempt to surrender, even if it is during the final assault on a fortified position. It is also forbidden to declare that \\"no quarter will be given\\".IV Hague Convention. The Laws and Customs of War on Land October 18, 1907.Article 23 Historical significance Last stands loom large in history due to the pull on popular imagination. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick argues: During World War I, the expression to fight \\"with one's back to the wall\\" became a widely-known way to refer to making a last stand. The London Times reported on April 13, 1918 that General Douglas Haig ordered British troops that \\"Every position must be held to the last man...With our backs to the wall...each one of us must fight on to the end\\".

He assumed the surname of Denham late in life; he inherited his cousin's baronetcy of Coltness in 1773. Early life He was one of 12 children of Sir James Steuart, Solicitor General for Scotland under Queen Anne and George I, and was born in Edinburgh. His mother was Anne Dalrymple, daughter of Lord North Berwick, the Lord President of the Court of Session. After graduating from the University of Edinburgh he was admitted to the Scottish bar at the age of twenty-four. He then spent some years on the Continent, and while in Rome entered into relations with the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart. He was in Edinburgh in 1745, and so compromised himself that, after the battle of Culloden, he found it necessary to return to the Continent, where he remained until 1763. It was not until 1771 that he was fully pardoned for any complicity he may have had in the rebellion. He died at his family seat, Coltness, in Lanarkshire. He married Lady Frances Wemyss (1722‚Äì1789), younger sister of David Wemyss, Lord Elcho, who played a prominent role in the 1745 Rising. Their son, Sir James Steuart Denham (1744-1839), edited his father's works, was a Member of Parliament, and Colonel of the Scots Greys. He ended his career as a General and lived to be ninety-five; on his death, both baronetcies went to a cousin who died in 1851, since when they have been dormant. Their daughter Agnes married Henry Erskine, 10th Earl of Buchan. =Family= Steuart was descended from another Sir James Stewart, knight, an Edinburgh merchant and staunch Presbyterian, who supported Charles II in the British Civil Wars of 1642-1660 and who died in 1681, having made enough money to purchase landed estates for his sons; three of those sons were prominent enough to have their families receive the title of Baronet after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. They were: Sir Thomas Steuart of Coltness, the first son; Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees, Lord Advocate, the fourth son; Sir Robert Steuart of Allandale, the youngest of the seven sons. The Lord Advocate, Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees, was his grandfather; his father, also Sir James Steuart, was the eldest son of the Lord Advocate, and rose to be Solicitor General for Scotland. =Titles= The 3rd Baronet of Goodtrees, the subject of this article, inherited his baronetcy and estates at the age of fourteen. He eventually acquired much of the possession of his cousins, the senior line of Steuarts. Sir Thomas Steuart of Coltness, had married twice: to Margaret Elliot, his step-mother's daughter, and then to Susan Denham, the sister of Sir William Denham, 1st Baronet of Westshield, Master of the Mint for Scotland, and had fourteen sons by them. His eldest son had sold the estate and mansion (but not the title) of Coltness to 3rd Baronet of Goodtrees' father, in 1712.Reliable sources differ on when and to whom the Goodtrees baronetcy was given. It was in honour of the Lord Advocate, but while the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography twice says it was conferred on him in 1695, the Complete Baronetcy says it was given to his son, the future Solicitor General, in 1705, on the occasion of the son's marriage, in the father's lifetime. The chief significance of this question is the numbering of the baronets; it is not inconceivable that both grants occurred.ODNB, Complete Baronetage The 3rd Baronet of Goodtrees is, therefore, often called of Coltness, since it was his house. The 3rd Baronet of Goodtrees, however, eventually sold the estate of Goodtrees after he returned from France. By that time, the last surviving son of Sir Thomas Steuart had inherited the Coltness baronetcy from his father as well as the property and baronetcy of Denham of Westshield through his mother, styling himself Sir Archibald Steuart Denham, Baronet. When Sir Archibald died, in 1773, the baronetcy of Coltness, and the Steuart property, passed to Sir James Steuart; the Denham title and property passed to the last heir of the Denhams, Sir Archibald's half-nephew on his mother's side, who took the style of Sir William Lockhart Denham. When he died, three years later, in 1776, the Denham baronetcy became extinct; he also left his property, including the estate of Westshield, to Sir James Steuart, who then assumed the name of Denham, although he was not descended from. For the last four years of his life, therefore, he was Sir James Steuart Denham, Baronet, of Coltness and Westshield. His major book and his posthumous collected works were published as by Sir James Steuart; economic literature also calls him Sir James Steuart Denham. Works Inquiry into the principles of political oeconomy, 1767 In 1767 Steuart published An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy, the first book by a Scottish economist with 'political economy' in the title, explaining usage of the term as that: > [just as] economy in general [is] the art of providing for all the wants of > a family, [so the science of political economy] seeks to secure a certain > fund of subsistence for all the inhabitants, to obviate every circumstance > which may render it precarious; to provide every thing necessary for > supplying the wants of the society, and to employ the inhabitants ... in > such manner as naturally to create reciprocal relations and dependencies > between them, so as to supply one another with reciprocal wants. The book was the most complete and systematic survey of the science from the point of view of moderate mercantilism which had appeared in England and indeed the first full-fledged economics treatise to appear anywhere. Also the German philosopher Hegel recognized that book and wrote a comment about it in the year 1799.See page 16 in Willy MOOG: Hegel und die Hegelsche Schule. Published by Ernst Reinhard Verlag, Munich, 1930. Although often regarded as part of the Scottish Enlightenment which produced David Hume and Adam Smith, Steuart's economics hark back to the earlier Mercantilist era.M. Beer \\"Early British Economics: from the XIIth to the middle of the XVIIIth century\\". Frank Cass, London 1967 Mercantilism was the school of thought that held that a positive balance of trade was of primary importance for any nation and required a ban on the export of gold and silver. This theory led to high protective tariffs to maximize the use of domestic resources, colonial expansion and exclusivity of trade with those colonies. British attempts to follow the mercantilist ideas led to the four Anglo-Dutch navigation wars and the American colonials wars of 1776-1781 and 1812. Additionally in 1815, Britain adopted the high tariff, called the corn laws on all imported wheat at the suggestion of mercantalist advisors. Debate over the corn laws would be harsh and would dominate the political discussion and occupy all British governments until the corn laws were repealed in 1846. At the level of any individual sales transaction, mercantilism held that profit was developed at the point of the sale. Steuart held that profit was a mere \\"surcharge\\" upon alienation (sale) of the commodity.Karl Marx, \\"Theories of Surplus Value\\" contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31 (International Publishers: New York, 1989) p. 40. Steuart was not a pure mercantilist, however, he believed in a \\"scientific form of mercantilism.\\"Karl Marx, \\"Theories of Surplus Value\\" contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 30 (International Publishers: New York, 1988), p. 348. Steuart held that all profit arose from the seller \\"overcharging\\" the buyer in any single sales transaction. However, Steuart did allow that the \\"profit\\" obtained through exchange would \\"fluctuate\\" with the rise and/or fall in demand.Karl Marx, \\"Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy\\" contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29 (International Publishers: New York, 1987) p. 163. Still like all good mercantilists, Steuart's eye remained on the exchange as the creator of profit and he recognized no value in a commodity before the sale. Steuart was one of the last representatives of the mercantilist school of economic thought.See biographical note in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31 (International Publishers: New York, 1989) p. 605. Although the work appears to have been well received its impact was overshadowed by Smith's Wealth of Nations that was published only nine years later. Adam Smith never quotes or mentions Steuart's book, although he was acquainted with him. It has been argued that Smith avoided Steuart's arguments because they would have undermined his Utopia.David Harvey Class 12, 23min 00sec Moreover, the attacks on Mercantilism in the Wealth of Nations appear to have been mainly directed against Steuart. As Smith appears to have thought that Steuart's conversation was better than his book, he probably wished to keep clear of controversy with him. Steuart's book was received much more favourably a century later by the members of the Historical school of economics.

In particular, it focuses on the design notations and visual languages that can be used for the realization of robust, well-structured, usable and maintainable Web applications. Designing a data- intensive Web site amounts to specifying its characteristics in terms of various orthogonal abstractions. The main orthogonal models that are involved in complex Web application design are: data structure, content composition, navigation paths, and presentation model. In the beginning of web development, it was normal to access Web applications by creating something with no attention to the developmental stage. In the past years, web design firms had many issues with managing their Web sites as the developmental process grew and complicated other applications. Web development tools have helped with simplifying data-intensive Web applications by using page generators. Microsoft's Active Server Pages and JavaSoft's Java Server Pages have helped by bringing out content and using user-programmed templates. Several languages and notations have been devised for Web application modeling.

In addition to their inherent multifaceted functionality, these Web applications exhibit complex behaviour and place some unique demands on their usability, performance, security, and ability to grow and evolve. However, a vast majority of these applications continue to be developed in an ad-hoc way, contributing to problems of usability, maintainability, quality and reliability.Roger S Pressman, \\"What a Tangled Web we Weave,\\" IEEE Software, Jan/Feb 2001, Vol. 18, No.1, pp 18-21 While Web development can benefit from established practices from other related disciplines, it has certain distinguishing characteristics that demand special considerations. In recent years, there have been developments towards addressing these considerations. Web engineering focuses on the methodologies, techniques, and tools that are the foundation of Web application development and which support their design, development, evolution, and evaluation. Web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development. Web engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas: systems analysis and design, software engineering, hypermedia/hypertext engineering, requirements engineering, human-computer interaction, user interface, information engineering, information indexing and retrieval, testing, modelling and simulation, project management, and graphic design and presentation. Web engineering is neither a clone nor a subset of software engineering, although both involve programming and software development. While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles, it encompasses new approaches, methodologies, tools, techniques, and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of Web-based applications.  As a discipline  Proponents of Web engineering supported the establishment of Web engineering as a discipline at an early stage of Web. Major arguments for Web engineering as a new discipline are: * Web-based Information Systems (WIS) development process is different and unique.Gerti Kappel, Birgit Proll, Seiegfried, and Werner Retschitzegger, \\"An Introduction to Web Engineering,\\" in Web Engineering, Gerti Kappel, et al. (eds.) John Wiley and Sons, Heidelberg, Germany, 2003 * Web engineering is multi-disciplinary; no single discipline (such as software engineering) can provide complete theory basis, body of knowledge and practices to guide WIS development. * Issues of evolution and lifecycle management when compared to more 'traditional' applications. * Web- based information systems and applications are pervasive and non-trivial. The prospect of Web as a platform will continue to grow and it is worth being treated specifically. However, it has been controversial, especially for people in other traditional disciplines such as software engineering, to recognize Web engineering as a new field. The issue is how different and independent Web engineering is, compared with other disciplines.

White also coached the Under-21 Springbok side to victory in the Under-21 World Cup in 2002. He was coach of the Brumbies in the Super Rugby from 2012, but resigned with two years remaining on his contract in 2013 to return to South Africa.Brumbies accept Jake White's resignation On returning to South Africa, he coached the Sharks for a single season, explaining he wanted to seek international opportunities. This arose in a technical role with the Tongan national team. After assisting Tonga in their 3 Test European Tour, White was announced as Montpellier's new boss, overseeing all coaching aspects for the club.Jake White takes over at Montpellier On 24 October 2011, he was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame, alongside other World Cup-winning head coaches and captains through the 2007 World Cup. Coaching resume up to 2004 Jake White was born in Johannesburg and attended Jeppe High School for Boys where he played in the First XV. He began his coaching career as a high school rugby coach at Parktown Boys' High School's First XV before returning to his old school as a teacher and as coach of the school's First XV. White's success with the school team resulted in him being appointed as provincial schools coach. He coached various under-19 and under-21 sides before assisting Springbok squad preparations by doing video analysis for them. From 1997 to 1999 he was a technical advisor to Nick Mallet, being part of the 17 Test winning record by the Springboks. In 1999 he was the assistant coach to the U-21 Springboks, coached by Eric Sauls and captained by John Smit. While assistant coach of the U-21 they won the SANZAR tournament in Argentina, beating England, Ireland, Wales, Australia, France en route to the finals and then beat New Zealand in the final. From 2000-2001 he was an assistant to Harry Viljoen at the Springboks. By this time he was well known for his technical prowess in rugby circles, and he lived up to his reputation by coaching the under-21 Springbok side to a victory in the U-21 Rugby Union World Cup in 2002. Springbok coach White was appointed as head coach of the national team in early 2004 following South Africa's poor performance at the 2003 World Cup and the Kamp Staaldraad scandal. His first move was to install John Smit as captain, which drew a substantial amount of criticism, despite the success they achieved leading the Springboks. =2004= White started his Springbok coaching career with a 2‚Äì0 series win over Ireland, followed by wins over Wales and a combined Pacific Islanders team in the 2004 June rugby union tests. He then proceeded to coach South Africa to their first Tri-Nations trophy since 1998. Soon after the 2004 Tri Nations victory, White's contract was extended to after the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the November Internationals, South Africa attempted a Grand Slam, beating Wales and Scotland, but losing to Ireland and England. They concluded the Tour with a win over Argentina in Buenos Aires. The Springbok resurgence was recognised with a sweep of the major International Rugby Board Awards. The Boks were named Team of the Year, White Coach of the Year, and flanker Schalk Burger Player of the Year. =2005= In the 2005 Tri Nations Series, the Springboks and All Blacks each won 3 tests, but New Zealand won the Championship on bonus points. =2006= The 2006 season got off to a strong start with a 36‚Äì16 win over a confident Scotland contingent; fresh off the back of beating both France and England and finishing third in the Six Nations of that year. This optimism was soon replaced by intense apprehension and frustration over the following months as the Boks narrowly beat the same Scotland side the following week as Springbok kingpin Schalk Burger suffered a career- threatening neck injury in the very same game. A disappointing loss to France in Cape Town left the side bereft of confidence ahead of a Tri-Nations opener against Australia. A member of the conditioning team stated that the Boks no longer felt they were in a comfort zone going into the Tri-Nations. Perhaps the lowest point in Springbok history, alongside the 2002 drubbing at the hands of England; the Springboks were dealt a record defeat to Australia by 49 points to nil. The matched was marred by very inaccurate play, punctuated by flyhalf Jaco Van Der Westhyzen's purported 'drop kick' just outside his 22 after fumbling the ball. Larkham led his charges magnificently in exposing the Springboks defensive frailties and shattering any chance of a Bok revival. A week later and the Boks put up a much stronger showing against New Zealand. Though the Boks frustrating ill-discipline allowed for the All Blacks to tally a total of seven penalties to pull away comfortably. Pressure was beginning to mount at this point, and so too injuries. The Boks gave New Zealand a real working over at the breakdown and dominated the All Black line-out throughout; but the aforementioned ill-discipline and the sublime Dan Carter were too much to contain in the end. Bakkies Botha injured his calf on the eve of this test requiring surgery and joined stalwart Schalk Burger as a long-term injury. Jake rallied his troops in the Springbok's final match of their away tour in the newly expanded Tri-Nations. The Springboks looked set to seal their first win of the competition until a late try by Mat Rogers allowed for Mortlock to score the winning conversion and compound Bok woes. The loss splintered morale and soon political turmoil would engulf the team as Jake White's tenure was put into question. Supposed secret meetings in England and the issue of transformation put considerable strain on the team as a meeting with the powerful All Blacks loomed later in August. Numerous journalists in South Africa with strong ties to Cheeky Watson campaigned viciously for the removal of Jake. This a knee-jerk reaction to Jake's refusal to play Luke Watson and name him captain of the side. With the Boks now on home soil they had time to reflect on their failings and regroup. Despite this brief reprieve the beleaguered Boks seemed to undo their good work in the previous two tests in exhibiting yet another poor defensive display that harkened back to the 49‚Äì0 loss in their opening game. A burst of three tries inside ten minutes allowed New Zealand to dominate the game and confirm their status as the preeminent force in world rugby. A strong fightback by the Boks was not enough as they were held at arm's length and masterfully picked off. Backs firmly planted to the wall the Springboks were determined to end their campaign strongly and salvage some measure of respectability. Jake seemed to find the right balance in the back row and the Boks stubbornly defeated New Zealand in a disciplined and accurate display at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium. The Boks rolled up to Ellis Park the following week to right the wrongs of their heartbreaking loss to Australia in their final away match; they provided another very strong showing with yet another disciplined and accurate display. The standout feature of this match was the manner in which Solly Tyibilika outplayed his more fancied opposite George Smith ‚Äì regarded by many as the greatest fetcher of his era. With back-to-back wins over their Tri-Nations rivals Jake White decided to rest the remainder of his front line players for the up-coming End of Year Tour. They started their campaign against Ireland in celebration of 100 years of Bok rugby. The Irish however had other ideas and put away three tries that exposed the poor defence of Pierre Spies in particular and Bryan Habana out of position at 13. Spies was twice caught charging out of the line and the Irish swiftly punished that opening each time. The Springboks, fielding a largely experimental side, fought hard as Habana and debutant Francois Steyn dotted down in the second half. That comeback was roundly ended by Horgan after O'Driscoll expertly put him away to seal the game. Next up was a two test encounter against England at fortress Twickenham. The Springboks had not beaten England since the Spring Tour of 2000 where the Boks won 18‚Äì13. England exacted revenge a week later and had built a period of dominance spanning six years. Even more disconcerting was that the Boks had not won at Twickenham since 1997; this leaving the Boks with a nine-year hoodoo to break. The Boks dominated England for much of the first test and seemed certain of victory until a late try by Phil Vickery gave England the result. A key turning point in the game was the injury to Butch James. His replacement, Andr√© Pretorius failed to deliver the steadiness Butch provided and missed an important penalty. However, the Boks gained confidence from this display and relished their second chance to redeem themselves. Unlike the first test, England got off to a strong start with stinging attacks that left the Boks defending for most of the first 30 minutes. In fact, it wasn't until the 26th minute that the Boks launched their first serious attack started by nuggety scrumhalf Ricky Januarie. England finally scored on the half-hour mark, but a missed conversion signalled the end of their dominance. The Boks got to work dominating the English with bruising defence, probing tactical kicks and set piece superiority. Burly prop CJ Van Der Linde punctating the Bok's dominance in brushing aside two defenders as he burst his way through England's defensive line and dotting down for a crucial score. Andr√© Pretorius nailed three drop-goals which left the English on the ropes. As England became more desperate and lost for invention, the game slipped further away from them. The curse of the Red Rose was final lifted in arguably the most important victory of the 2006 campaign. The result unfortunately ended the tenure of Andy Robinson as England dubiously replaced him with Brian Ashton. Jake White however just managed to stave off his critics and end what was an emotionally exhausting season. The final analysis was that this was a year of growth as much as it was a disappointing lost opportunity. Injuries to Schalk Burger (broken neck), Bakkies Botha (calf surgery), Jean De Villiers (cracked rib), Bryan Habana (cracked rib), Butch James (groin and knee), Andr√© Pretorius (groin), Joe Van Niekerk (C5 & C6 vertebrae), Jacques Cronje (cracked rib), Danie Rossouw (hamstring), Juan Smith (left quadriceps), Eddie Andrews (back), BJ Botha (back surgery), CJ Van Der Linde (Leg), Gurthro Steenkamp (broken hand), Pedrie Wannenburg (wrist surgery), Marius Joubert (fractured hand) among other lesser injuries stretched the Bok's depth to its limit. The blessing was that it allowed the Boks to break their reliance on certain individuals and expand their depth in blooding new players and testing new combinations. Francois Steyn was undoubtedly the find of the season alongside the elusive Ruan Pienaar. Jake also found depth in Wynand Olivier and Pierre Spies; the former being used extensively in plugging gaps left by injuries in the backline. Jake lamented the many lost opportunities of this campaign but was optimistic about the various changes they made to their defensive patterns and saw it as an important learning cuve ahead of the World Cup the following year. =2007: World Champions and \\"Resignation\\"= Jake White with the William Webb Ellis Cup (2007) The Springboks could not have started their campaign any better as they utterly demolished England in back-to-back tests. Again, this being very important in the context of their World Cup campaign, as they faced the World Champions in the same group. England must however be credited for their resolve in the second test where a Jonny Wilkinson led side actually led the game at half-time. South Africa were guilty of sloppy play in the opening 40 minutes which was met by stern midfield defence by the English. A powerful scrum aided England in securing a measure of dominance. Fresh from the break however South Africa stepped up and rampantly tore into their guests. This culminated in two 50 pointers in as many weeks. The fans suddenly began to believe in their side again. Then came more political meddlings to sour the mood. Oregan Hoskins ‚Äì President of SARU ‚Äì proceeded to override Jake White in the selection of Luke Watson as an addition to the 45-man squad submitted by Jake to the South African Rugby Union. Luke Watson went on to represent South Africa in ten tests, his first and solitary test of this particular year being in the following Samoan test at Ellis Park. In a game that was well suited to the fetcher Watson did very little to justify his position in the team. His performance was disjointed and substandard. This prompted Jake to reject him authoritatively ‚Äì something Jake's successor, Peter de Villiers would do the following year after similarly poor performances. The Springboks won this test convincingly on the scoreboard but Samoa were not to be beaten without a fight in a typical arm-wrestle of a test. With the Spring Tour successfully negotiated the Boks embarked on their Tri-Nations opener. They began their campaign at home against Australia in a powerful display. They attacked the fringes with strong carries by their big ball carriers and tied up the Australians before attacking wide. Guilty of missing several opportunities they did however leave victory late as the audacious Francois Steyn blasted over two monstrous drop-goals to seal the result. This set up a tense encounter with arch-rivals New Zealand. The Boks were on course to seal the result before Graham Henry unloaded his bench. His fresh reserves gave New Zealand a much stronger finish which resulted in a match winning try by New Zealand flyer Joe Rokocoko. Following this test Jake announced that he would be resting his key players for the remainder of the competition. This was met with staunch criticism from their SANZAR partners which went so far as John O'Neill ‚Äì Head of the Australian Rugby Union ‚Äì castigated South Africa for not fielding full strength sides on their away leg. O'Neill also said the Springboks had cost Australian Rugby at least 10,000 paying customers at the test in Sydney because of their decision to leave 20 of their best players in South Africa. O'Neill was incensed by comments by Springboks coach Jake White, who said the injury to stand-in Springboks captain Bobby Skinstad justified his decision to rest leading players such as Victor Matfield, Schalk Burger and Bryan Habana. \\"Now you know why I didn't bring those other guys here,\\" White said. \\"I could be sitting here with my front-line players out for six months.\\" O'Neill retorted: \\"Some of the stuff Jake White has said are the most extraordinary of contradictions. He is basically saying that because Bobby Skinstad has a broken rib, that supports his decision to leave all the players behind. He is basically saying that his only objective this year is the World Cup. He has made it clear that whatever he has to do in between ‚Äì so be it. That said, the makeshift Springbok side made a mockery of their critics as they led a full strength Australian side 17‚Äì0 after 40 minutes. Wickus Van Heerden powering over and Breyton Paulse latching onto a wide pass by Nathan Sharpe. Hougaard missed two kickable penalties however. This was Stephen Larkham and George Gregan's final game in Australia; an emotional occasion. Thus they were not to be beaten without a fight. Australia had an attacking line-out inside South Africa's 22, they employed a deceptive play which appeared to be a forward drive with Gregan standing afar but was instead a rouse which had Larkham cut the Boks and send Mark Gerrard over for their opening points. From here the Australians showed just how dangerous their back division could be and scored two further tries to escape an embarrassing defeat and send off their legendary heroes with a victory. The Boks went into the final game of the tournament seemingly without a hope of winning. The All Blacks were deemed far too powerful for this makeshift team. That said they decided to take the fight to their hosts front the first second as JP Pietersen fielded a kick-off and ran right through several would-be tacklers. They played with greater endeavour than what was to be expected. The half-time interval saw New Zealand on fractionally ahead 6‚Äì3. New Zealand would not see their first try until eleven minutes from time when Rokocoko's flick pass found Leonard. This broke the Boks and two further tries were scored to add gloss to the final score, Carter dotting down after the hooter had sounded. It was noted that the Boks rush defence frustrated the All Blacks and prevented them from executing wider attacking plays. Breyton Paulse in particular was adept at cutting off their outside backs and limiting the All Blacks. Had Hougaard not missed two vital kicks the result may not have been so comfortable. The Boks unfortunately ended bottom of the table, but had displayed great strength in depth and resolve. Later Eddie Jones would join the Bok camp in a consultancy capacity. He revealed that he worked on the linkage between 9 and 10 and the motion of the ball. It added a little more variety to the Boks in what was an otherwise powerful Springbok side with great skills and considerable fitness. The latter being a part of Jake's plan for the World Cup which was timed perfectly. The Boks went into the World Cup off the back of two strong wins against Namibia and Scotland. Scotland providing very stern opposition. Captain John Smit remarked that the opening game against Samoa was the most physical he had ever played. The Samoans were full of running and put considerable strain on the Bok's defensive line. They scored the first try through Gavin Williams to bring the score to 9‚Äì7. It was an intense arm-wrestle throughout the first half in spite of Montgomery and Habana's tries which gave South Africa a 21‚Äì7 half-time lead. The second half started in much the same manner it ended; with Samoa lashing into the Boks. Jean De Villiers was taken off with a torn bicep and replaced by Frans Steyn. Frans impact was immense and his first touch of the ball was the break out of his own 22 and send JP Pietersen down the touchline in a breathtaking attack. His physicality in defence of his channel and elusive power on attack seemed to lift the Springboks. He provided the assured authority that Jean was never able to provide. This combined with the Boks superior set-pieces set the tone for a ruthless demolition of Samoa. The game ended with eight tries to the Boks, a cruel end to what was a heroic showing by the Samoans. The result drew the attention of rest of the teams in the competition and it was clear the Boks had rolled up with intent. Bryan Habana's quartet of tries reflective of the Bok's willingness to attack with efficient ruthlessness. Their next encounter was a crucial clash with World Champions England. England, now on a three-game losing streak to the Boks, were on the ropes after a scrappy and poor showing against the USA. It took no longer than four minutes before Du Preez sent Juan Smith over for a try. The Boks dominated their opposition, displaying a tactically astute game plan. Du Preez was the mastermind and he orchestrated South Africa's next try as he regathered a loose ball and tore through England's defence; he sent JP Pietersen over for his first try of the evening and later in the second half broke away on the blindside to put JP Pietersen away for his second. This victory set the tone for South Africa's triumph. They employed a strong tactical kicking game backed-up by stout defence and the best line-out in the world. With a clinical counter-attacking game the Boks were able to vary their approach and ended the year the number one ranked team in the world. The Springboks' final pool match was against the US in Montpellier. They ran in nine tries to two to win 64‚Äì15 and finish on top of Pool A. The only downside was a knee injury to prop BJ Botha, which would rule him out for the rest of the World Cup. White was pleased with his team's efforts: > What we wanted to accomplish was to get some structure and continuity to our > game. Some of the tries we scored were very pleasing. I don't think the US > are as weak as the scoreline suggests. The most important thing was that we > put things together on a game day. We haven't been executing them that well > so far, but I was happy with the way we kept the ball alive. Further accolades were to follow; the day after the World Cup final victory, White was named IRB Coach of the Year for the second time. On 29 October, barely a week after the Springboks' World Cup success, the South African Rugby Union (SARU) confirmed that White had not re-applied for the position of Springboks coach and would therefore not be considered for the role. Although White's contract expired on 31 December, he was angry with the way the SARU had acted, stating that his contract did not require him to apply and that he had asked for time to consider his options, but had not been granted his request. Shortly after finishing as Springbok coach, White released his autobiography, In Black and White, The Jake White Story. As of February 2008, the book had sold 210,000 copies in South Africa, outselling even Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Post-Springbok coaching career After leading the Springboks to the Rugby World Cup glory Jake White took on a role working at the International Rugby Board assisting with their technical committee. He performed this role from 2008 to 2012. He also held positions in the IRB as a consultant, as well as in the South African Rugby Legends Association's upliftment programmes for underprivileged people. =Brumbies 2012‚Äì13= The Brumbies finished first in the Australian conference with ten wins, and third on the overall table. The Reds had also won ten games, but the Brumbies had a greater points difference. They faced the Cheetahs at home in Canberra in a semi-final qualifier, and survived a last-minute scare when Riaan Smit's conversion attempt ‚Äì which if successful would have forced the match into extra-time ‚Äì hit the upright, the final score 15‚Äì13. The Brumbies then travelled to Pretoria to face the Bulls at Loftus Versfeld in the semi-final. The Bulls had won 22 of their previous 24 games at Loftus, including all five finals. The Brumbies started well and led at half-time 16‚Äì11. But the Bulls were determined to keep their unblemished finals record at home intact, and worked their way back into the game to lead 23‚Äì19 with 14 minutes to go. Then Bulls captain Dewald Potgieter turned down three opportunities to score penalty goals, instead opting each time to go for a try, presumably to put the game beyond the Brumbies' reach. In the 78th minute, the Brumbies seized their chance when fly-half Matt Toomua made an incisive break and passed to Tevita Kuridrani who touched down to help give the Brumbies a 26‚Äì23 lead. There was still time for one last kick-off, but the Bulls lost possession, enabling the Brumbies to kick the ball into touch and celebrate a victory which White described as \\"the greatest the Brumbies have ever had\\". The Brumbies then had to travel to Hamilton where they would have to face the Chiefs in the 2013 Super Rugby Final. The Brumbies had led the match 9‚Äì0 with 20 minutes gone, however a burst of penalties saw the Chiefs even the score by the 31st minute. A try late on in the first half by Christian Lealiifano saw the Brumbies lead 16‚Äì9 at half time. Early on in the second half, Lealiifano booted a further two penalties to reach their final score of 22, with Lealiifano having scored all the points. But two tries conceded at the 63rd and 67th minute by Liam Messam and Robbie Robinson saw the home side lead 24‚Äì22 with 10 minutes to go. Despite a strong attack by the Brumbies, the Chiefs defence remained strong and the match finished 27‚Äì22. In 2013 Brumbies beat British and Irish Lions 14-12 during their Australian tour, which was the first Lions loss to a non- international side since 2005, when they lost to MƒÅori All Blacks, though they had a draw with Emerging Springboks in 2009. After a successful stint with the Brumbies, White was believed to be a strong contender for the Wallabies head coaching role when Robbie Deans resigned. However, he beaten to the role by fellow Super Rugby coach Ewen McKenzie. Surprisingly, after just two mounts after leading the Brumbies to second in the Super Rugby, White resigned from his post at the Brumbies explaining he wanted to return home to South Africa.Jake White shocks Brumbies by quitting On 7 October 2013, White was appointed director of rugby at the Sharks, replacing Brendan Venter. =Sharks 2014 = One of White's first actions as the Sharks' director of rugby was to establish Pat Lambie at fly-half for the upcoming Super Rugby season, saying that he felt that the talented Springbok utility back had been \\"messed around\\" with enough. White also announced that Francois Steyn would play at 12, the inside centre position. The decision was partly to provide Steyn some much- needed stability, but also because he felt that playing Steyn at inside centre would help Lambie: > With Frans at 12, you will see a much better Pat Lambie. Even at 80 percent, > Frans is a better player than most people at 100 percent. We will do > whatever we can to make those two the best 10‚Äì12 combination in the > competition. White's next move was to restructure the Sharks' on-field > leadership; he replaced Keegan Daniel with Bismarck du Plessis as captain, > and appointed Lambie, Odwa Ndungane and Jean Deysel as vice-captains. White's first game in charge of the Sharks was a friendly on 25 January with Saracens F.C. in London. On 15 February, the Sharks started their 2014 Super Rugby campaign in the best way possible with a bonus-point 31‚Äì16 victory against arch-rivals the Bulls in Durban. But the Sharks' first major hurdle of the season came during the re-match against the Bulls in Pretoria on 22 March. Up to that stage, the Sharks had been undefeated. In addition to losing the match 23‚Äì19, their starting halves combination was injured early. Pat Lambie was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn bicep tendon, and Cobus Reinach fractured his hand, which would cause him to miss eight weeks. White went on to coach the Sharks to top of the South African conference, finishing third overall in the table. They had to host the Highlanders in the quarter-finals, where for much of the match, the home side led, finishing 31‚Äì27. Unfortunately for the Sharks, they had to travel to Christchurch to face the Crusaders who were favourite to win the competition. The Sharks lost the match 38‚Äì6, conceding 5 tries, 4 of which came in the second half. The result came as a massive surprise for some, since the Sharks had the best defence in the competition in the normal season. Like with the Brumbies, two months after leading the Sharks to that Semi-final, White resigned as Director of Rugby, to pursue an international role ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. =Tonga= On 13 October 2014, White joined Tonga as a member of the backroom staff, and acted as a technical advisor for head coach Mana Otai for the Test Tour of Europe.http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-news/tonga-add-jake-white-coaching- staff-6105248http://www.espnscrum.com/other/rugby/story/244109.htmlhttp://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/Jake- White-gets-role-with-Tonga-20141013 White and Otai led Tonga to 2 from 3 wins during their 2014 European Tour. The tour began with a 23‚Äì9 victory over Georgia, which included a late surge off tries during the closing quarter to secure the win. The following week, Tonga kept their 100% win rate intact against the United States, winning 40‚Äì12 in Gloucester. The 'Ikale Tahi were praised heavily for their defensive abilities in their opening two matches of their tour, keeping Georgia tryless completely and the United States tryless in the second half. But Tonga were also praised for their new attacking flair, and with hand in ball, with some people expecting a first-ever clean sweep on European tour heading into the final match against Scotland. Jake White had believed to be the main inputter into this new structure. Despite the first half being a close 14‚Äì12 at half time, Scotland ran away with the match in the second half, scoring a further 3 tries to win 37‚Äì12. Mana Otai had hoped to keep White on board for the World Cup, and until December 2014, there had still been no official announcement on White's future with Tonga. =Montpellier= On 30 December, Jake White was announced as the new boss for French club Montpellier, where he would oversee all coaching aspects for the club.Montpellier unveil White as new boss This came after a poor run of results in both the 2014‚Äì15 Top 14 season and the 2014‚Äì15 European Rugby Champions Cup. Already Montpellier's forwards coach Mario Ledesma had been sacked, with backs coach St√©phane Glas also tipped to be getting the boot. However, on White announcement, Glas would remain at the club with former Springbok Shaun Sowerby joining the backroom staff as the new forwards coach. Fabien Galthi√© who was in charge of the club before White, will still remain with the club but it is still unclear what role he will play in the new set- up. \\"...He also held positions in the IRB as a consultant, as well as in the South African Rugby Legends Association's upliftment programmes for underprivileged people\\" Springbok coaching record and achievements :By year { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - !

This line was dismantled by Confederate forces during the Civil War so that the iron rails could be used elsewhere. The railroad was not rebuilt until 1877. In 1874, the company took control of the Pensacola and Perdido Railroad, which ran west from Pensacola about five miles to a lumber mill at Millview, Florida on Perdido Bay. In 1892, the system merged with the Pensacola, Alabama and Tennessee Railroad, which connected the Millview and Muscogee branches. Shortly thereafter, the railroad was renamed the Gulf Ports Terminal Railway. In 1910, the Gulf Ports Terminal Railway was acquired by Southern States Lumber, which operated of track to move lumber from forests in Baldwin County, Alabama, to its large mill at Muscogee, and on to the port of Pensacola for export. The combined system had a total length of around . In 1911, the railroad was acquired by the Gulf, Florida, and Alabama Railway. Soon after, construction of a line from Cantonment to Pensacola was begun, being completed in 1913. Almost immediately following the completion of this line, another, much longer line was begun, this one from Cantonment north via Atmore and Frisco City, Alabama to an interchange with the Southern Railway at Kimbrough, Alabama. The line, including a large bridge over the Alabama River, was completed in 1915. 1922-1997 In 1922, the Gulf, Florida, and Alabama Railway was acquired by the Muscle Shoals, Birmingham and Pensacola Railroad (MSB&P;), which only three years later was bought by the Frisco (St. Louis ‚Äì San Francisco Railway). After the acquisition, the Frisco constructed a line from Aberdeen, Mississippi to Kimbrough, connecting the former MSB&P; with the rest of the Frisco's system. This line was completed in 1928. During the middle of the 20th century, the railroad operated as part of the Frisco, moving bulk products south to Pensacola for export and produce products north, although chemical and paper products took on increased importance by the 1970s. Passenger service over the line continued until 1955, when the Sunnyland, operating between Pensacola and Kansas City, Missouri, via Amory, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, was discontinued. In 1980, the Frisco was acquired by the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN), itself a product of a merger of several railroads in 1970. In 1995, the BN merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to form the BNSF Railway. =Current railroad= In 1997, when BNSF spun off the route between Kimbrough and Pensacola, the Alabama and Gulf Coast was formed to take over operations. In 2003, BNSF sold additional trackage to the AGR: a line between Kimbrough and Columbus, Mississippi, as well as isolated trackage near Mobile, Alabama formerly part of the Alabama, Tennessee and Northern Railroad. As part of this deal, the AGR gained trackage rights on BNSF between Columbus and Amory and on the Norfolk Southern Railway between Mobile and Kimbrough. In 2002, the AGR, which had been formerly owned by States Rail, Inc., a short-line holding company, was acquired by RailAmerica. In late 2012, Genesee & Wyoming acquired the railroad as part of its acquisition of RailAmerica. Traffic The railroad's traffic comes mainly from industrial materials such as metals, coal, paper products, chemicals, and limestone. The AGR hauled around 61,000 carloads in 2008.

It is located on the Crowe River and along Highway 7 between Havelock to the west and Madoc to the east, about the half way point between Ottawa and Toronto. History The village was named after Marmora Township, which is itself named for the Latin word for marble. Marble is common in the area and a giant marble rock stood on nearby Crowe Lake. The rich history of Marmora Township is the story of mining in Eastern Ontario. Since 1820 this Township has played a leading role in the development of iron mining. In addition, copper, lead, silver, gold and lithographic limestone have been extracted. Iron mining was an important industry in the area during the 19th century. The village was originally named Marmora Iron Works. Gold and silver were also mined at nearby Cordova Mines. A nearby plant processes talc and dolomite. Marmora was separated from Marmora and Lake Township and incorporated as a village in 1901. On April 14, 1821, the government passed an act setting up Marmora Township and attaching it to Hastings County as per Charles Hayes's request to do so in 1820. The new Township took its name from the Latin word for 'marble' because of an ‚Äòimmense rock of most delicate white marble‚Äô. This giant rock stood on the southeast corner of Crowe Lake. The Lake took its name from the Crowe Indians that lived along the shore. Marmora Township was opened for sale in 1821, but there was little settlement outside of the newly created mining village. Although mining and lumbering have been vital to the Township, agriculture has probably supported more people in the area since 1850. A remaining legacy of iron mining is the Marmora Open Pit Mine, a man-made wonder-lake surrounded by a barbed wire fence, seventy five acres in area, five hundred and fifty feet deep, filled with four hundred feet deep of clear blue spring water that is steadily rising to the top. Marmora was re- amalgamated with the surrounding townships of Marmora and Lake in 2001 to form a newly expanded Municipality of Marmora and Lake. Local attractions and events Attractions include the Marmora Mine, an abandoned open-pit iron ore mine containing a wealth of minerals, including garnet and pyrite. This location is also a host to a variety of wildlife. The mine itself is filled with several hundred feet of water. The water originates from an underground spring which was exposed during mining operations. Camping and other outdoor recreational activities such as ATV trail riding, fishing, and hunting are very popular for locals and those on vacation. The Crowe River flows from Crowe Lake, which boasts excellent fishing for bass, muskie, pike, walleye, and a few other types of fish. Since 1979 Marmora SnoFest has held the annual Marmora Cup (dogsled racingdog-sled races). A Committee of Council was established in 2005 to provide a more defined structure for the running and organizing of the historical event. A Board of Directors was then formed in 2007. With its hosting and running of sled dog races it makes the Marmora SnoFest, host of the Marmora Cup, the longest running event of its type in Canada. There are two annual country Jamborees held in Marmora each year: the \\"Marmora Crowe Valley Lions Club Country Jamboree\\" at the Marmora Fair Grounds in June, and the \\"Marmora Country Jamboree\\" In September on Highway 14 just South of Marmora. Annual Marmora Area Canoe and Kayak Festival - Marmora and Lake is the host location as chosen by the Kawartha WhiteWater Paddlers. After a thorough river review throughout the province Marmora and Lake was chosen for its many rivers. Formerly annual festivities of Punk Fest led by Warren Hastings, a.k.a. Spider, were held here for several years before the township put them to an end, because they would not allow medics on site or supply washrooms/fresh water to the party-goers. \\"Punks\\" and bands from all over the world traveled to Marmora for the weekend's events. Former home of The Marmora Lakers Men's Senior AAA Hockey Team. It was recently sold in early 2008. Home of The Classic Cruisers (Car Show), running every Thursday at 6 pm throughout the summer. Home of Beautiful Glen Allan Park, a cottage and trailer resort since the early 1900s on the north shore of Crowe Lake. Home to the scenic Crowe Valley Campground, located in town alongside the Crowe River.

It is located some 3.5 km east of the village of Summerhill, in a field south of the R156 regional road at Clarkstown. Constructed in 1988 for the transmission of Atlantic 252 on 252 kHz, it uses one 248-metre-high guyed steel framework mast with triangular cross section, insulated against ground. The original transmitters were two 300 kilowatt Continental Solid State transmitters built by Varian Associates of Dallas. These were replaced in 2007 by a single 300 kilowatt Transradio TRAM 300L transmitter. The ground around the mast and the entire transmission site bed are lined with copper for conductivity. The site has an ITU-cleared transmission power of 500 kW by day and 100 kW at night but is now only capable of operating at 300 kW by day and 100 kW at night. Atlantic 252 ceased operations on 20 December 2001 and sports radio station TEAMtalk 252 briefly took over the frequency for a few months in 2002. The transmitter was later taken over by RT√â Networks Limited (now 2RN). It is now used for the AM version of RT√â Radio 1 on 252 kHz, and has been the sole source of RT√â Radio 1 on AM since 24 March 2008, when the medium wave Tullamore transmitter on 567 kHz was taken off air. In 2007, the transmitter was carrying a Digital Radio Mondiale multiplex overnight, featuring Radio 1, RT√â Digital Radio Sport, RT√â Digital Radio News and the World Radio Network, before reverting to AM transmission for the daytime.

Early life and education  Born in Pontiac, Michigan, he was the youngest of four children of Bertha (Sherman) and William James LeMessurier Sr., owners of a dry cleaning business. After finishing high school Bill left Michigan to major in Mathematics at Harvard College. LeMessurier graduated with an AB in Mathematics in 1947, then went to Harvard Graduate School of Design. He would later transfer over to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he earned his Master's Degree in building engineering and construction in 1953.William LeMessurier: Builder of Elegant Cutting-edge StructuresMIT Spectrum  Career  While at MIT, LeMessurier worked for Albert Goldberg an established Boston structural engineer, eventually he would become a partner and the firm was renamed Goldberg-LeMessurier Associates. In April 1961, the two separated and Bill launched his firm LeMessurier Consultants.Harvard Design School Faculty LeMessurier was responsible for the structural engineering on a large number of prominent buildings, including Boston City Hall, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Singapore Treasury Building, and the Dallas Main Center.  Controversy  LeMessurier is perhaps best known for a structural controversy. LeMessurier re-assessed his calculations on the Citicorp headquarters tower in New York City in 1978, after the building had already been finished, and found that the building was more vulnerable than originally thought (in part due to cost-saving changes made to the original plan by the contractor).

It takes its name from an ancestral figure, T≈´hoe-p≈çtiki. T≈´hoe is a MƒÅori-language word meaning \\"steep\\" or \\"high noon\\". T≈´hoe people also bear the sobriquet Nga Tamariki o te Kohu (\\"the children of the mist\\"). T≈´hoe traditional land is at Te Urewera (Te Urewera National Park) in the eastern North Island, a steep, heavily forested area which includes Lake Waikaremoana. T≈´hoe traditionally relied on the forest for their needs. The tribe had its main centres of population in the small mountain valleys of Ahikereru and Ruatahuna, with Maungapohatu, the inner sanctum of the Urewera, as their sacred mountain. The T≈´hoe country had a great reputation among the neighbouring tribes as a graveyard for invading forces. T≈´hoe people have a reputation for their continued strong adherence to MƒÅori identity and for their unbroken use of the MƒÅori language, which 60% of them still speak (2016 figure). Of the T≈´hoe people, estimated to number between 33,000 and 45,000,\\"2006 Census for T≈´hoe\\", tpk.govt.nz about 30 per cent still live on their tribal lands; most of the rest live in towns on the fringes of Te Urewera and in the larger North Island cities. At least 5,000 live in Australia. Subtribes of T≈´hoe include NgƒÅti Koura. The T≈´hoe continue to maintain camps in Te Urewera and help run conservation programmes for endangered birds, such as the North Island brown kiwi and the North Island k≈çkako. Many T≈´hoe return to their homelands every two years for the Te Hui Ahurei ƒÅ T≈´hoe (T≈´hoe Festival), which features kapa haka, debates, sports competitions, and fashion shows. The event provides an important opportunity to maintain ties with friends and relatives. History =19th century= T≈´hoe had little direct contact with the early European settlers. The first major contact occurred when the iwi fought against the settler government in the battle of ≈årƒÅkau in 1864. Rewi Maniapoto, who had some tribal links to T≈´hoe, visited the Urewera in 1862 and persuaded them to take part in the rebellion against the government; he went against the wishes of some of the elders. Initially reluctant, the T≈´hoe gave Rewi ammunition to back the rebellion.Stories without End. J. Binney. Bridget Williams. 2010. During a cease-fire in the Battle of Orakau, under a flag of truce, Gilbert Mair, a translator, was shot in the shoulder by a T≈´hoe warrior. Nearly all the T≈´hoe at the battle were killed. The following year authorities accused the T≈´hoe of sheltering Kereopa Te Rau, a Hauhau wanted for killing and beheading Karl Volkner, a missionary of the Church Missionary Society, in what was called the Volkner Incident. Initially, the T≈´hoe had cooperated in tracking down the Hauhau leader and had taken him prisoner. The T≈´hoe tried to use him as a bargaining chip but the government demanded Te Rau be handed over for trial. After the T≈´hoe released him, Te Rau hid in the Ureweras. As punishment, in 1866 the government confiscated 5700ha or about 7% of T≈´hoe land on its northern coastal border. The confiscated T≈´hoe land adjoined the land confiscated from Bay of Plenty rebels after the battle of Gate PƒÅ. The Crown took the T≈´hoe's only substantial flat, fertile land, which also provided their only access to the coast for kai moana (sea food). The T≈´hoe people retained only interior, more difficult land, setting the scene for later famines. In 1868, T≈´hoe sheltered the MƒÅori leader Te Kooti, a fugitive who had escaped from imprisonment on the Chatham Islands. Te Kooti arrived in the area with a large group of escaped convicts, fully armed with modern weapons he had stolen from the ship he had hijacked. It is doubtful that the T≈´hoe could have resisted his demands for sanctuary. Some T≈´hoe joined his armed Ringat≈´ band, but other T≈´hoe told government forces of Te Kooti's whereabouts. Some joined the armed forces to hunt him down. Government forces punished those T≈´hoe who supported Te Kooti during the manhunt. Te Ara, the Online Encyclopedia of New Zealand, notes: > Old enemies of T≈´hoe fought on the side of the government; they carried out > most of the raids into Te Urewera during a prolonged and destructive search > between 1869 and 1872. In a policy aimed at turning the tribe away from Te > Kooti, a scorched earth campaign was unleashed against T≈´hoe; people were > imprisoned and killed, their cultivations and homes destroyed, and stock > killed or runoff. Through starvation, deprivation and atrocities at the > hands of the government‚Äôs MƒÅori forces, T≈´hoe submitted to the Crown.\\"NgƒÅi > T≈´hoe\\", Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand Te Kooti himself escaped to the King Country, and after the events surrounding the hunt for him, T≈´hoe isolated themselves, closing off access to their lands by refusing to sell, lease or survey them, and blocking the building of roads. Twenty years later, Te Urewera leaders, Premier Seddon, and Native Affairs Minister Timi (James) Carroll negotiated the 1896 \\"Urewera District Native Reserve Act\\" (UDNR). It provided for T≈´hoe self-government through a General Committee and local committees, with the Native Land Court excluded and titles determined instead by a commission comprising two PƒÅkehƒÅ and five T≈´hoe commissioners. In practice however, the Crown through a mixture of ineptitude and bad-faith \\"...totally failed to give effect to its promises in the UDNR Act; failed to act fairly, reasonably, and honourably...and failed to protect the Treaty rights of all the peoples of Te Urewera...\\"\\"Te Urewera, Part III: From self-governing native reserve to national park\\", November 2012 MƒÅori Law Review =1916 police raid= The settlement of Maungapohatu in 1908 T≈´hoe prophet Rua Kenana in 1908 Historian Jamie Belich describes the Urewera as one of the last zones of MƒÅori autonomy, and the scene of the last case of armed MƒÅori resistance: the 1916 New Zealand Police raid to arrest the T≈´hoe prophet Rua Kenana. On 2 April 1916 a 70-strong, and heavily armed, police party arrived at Maungapohatu to arrest him for sedition. Because Rua's village was so remote, the police had to take a lot of equipment and camped on the way. They moved like a small army with wagons and pack-horses, and included New Zealand Herald photographer Arthur Breckon. So as not to alert the Maungapohatu village of their intention to spring an attack they did not wear their police uniforms till just before the raid. They were convinced that when they reached Maungapohatu there would be an ambush. There was no violent resistance from Rua personally,TipunaProfiles but his supporters fought a brisk half-hour gun battle with the police in which two MƒÅori, including Rua's son Toko, were killed and two wounded. Four constables were also wounded. Rua was arrested and transported to Rotorua, his hair and beard removed. From Rotorua, with six other MƒÅori prisoners including Whatu, Rua was transferred to Auckland and sent directly to Mount Eden prison. Rua was held, at first, on a nine months sentence imposed for the 1915 charges and now increased by his default of fines. After a trial on sedition which lasted 47 days, New Zealand's longest until 1977, he was found not guilty; but sentenced to one year's imprisonment for resisting the police.Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu (Judith Binney with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979), pages 119-124) =Twentieth century= Significant European penetration did not occur in the Urewera district until the 20th century. A road was built by the government from Rotorua to Ruatahuna in 1901 to end the isolation of T≈´hoe by opening up the first motor road. T≈´hoe did eventually realise, especially in the Great Depression, that to develop their local economy they needed good roads to the outside world. They donated some land for road rights of way. As early as 1906, T≈´hoe had given land for roads and offered free labour to assist in the construction, but building arterial roads in the Ureweras had a low government priority. In the early 1900s traces of gold were found in the Ureweras and Rua Te Kanana tried to sell illegal mining rights to raise money. At the same time Rua wished to sell very large areas of land to the government to raise funds for his new Jerusalem, but despite having a petition signed by every T≈´hoe adult, the government insisted that he stick to the law. In the 1920s Gordon Coates, Minister of Public Works, went to the area to check its suitability for a railway and to discuss roads. The land was very steep with the Poverty Bay Herald describing the gradient as \\"one in nothing\\". Coates knew that by this time, T≈´hoe refused to make any contribution to the road at all. The mountainous terrain was daunting for farming. T≈´hoe could not accumulate any capital to develop land they had cleared from 1907. Instead they sold all their sheep and cattle to pay for legal costs. These debts were not paid until 1931. In the early 1930s the government helped develop T≈´hoe land at both Ruatoki and Ruatahuna. It understood that, like many New Zealanders in the Great Depression, T≈´hoe had hard times. In 1934 a teacher wrote that \\"they have no money apart from what is given by government as Family Allowances and Old Age Pensions\\". A 1936 report noted that land development at Maungapohatu Mountain (a Ringatu stronghold) \\"would be a social success if undertaken\\". The report pointed out that the venture would probably fail if T≈´hoe were required to pay back both the interest and the capital. In 1937, after several other studies, the government decided that it was uneconomic to invest in roads or settlements. By this time, the isolated Maungapohatu settlement had collapsed anyway. =Late 20th and early 21st century= The T≈´hoe population was always small and living conditions were poor. School records from the 1920s and 1930s show very high death rates, especially of children. 75% of those who died were people under 25. The main causes of death were infectious diseases, such as influenza, gastroenteritis, typhoid fever and whooping cough. Between 1924 and 1936, the Depression period, 57 people died in a community of 30 families. From the late 1990s, some T≈´hoe started identifying as the \\"T≈´hoe nation\\", and emphasising widespread T≈´hoe rejection of what they call PƒÅkehƒÅ rule. Some said because they never signed the Treaty of Waitangi, they never gave up their sovereignty. T≈´hoe and other local iwi brought the Urewera claim to the Waitangi Tribunal in 2002, with submissions accepted up until 2005. =2007 police raid= There was a major armed-police raid in the Ureweras on 15 October 2007 amid claims that some T≈´hoe had run terrorist training-camps there. Roadblocks were set up between Ruatoki and Taneatua by armed police, who searched and questioned everyone who passed through, including a school bus, ()() and locals said they felt intimidated. No terrorism charges were laid, and the Police Commissioner Howard Broad later publicly apologised for the actions of his officers during the raid, acknowledging they had set back relations between police and T≈´hoe people: \\"We regret the hurt and stress caused to the community of Ruatoki and we will seek an appropriate way to repair the damage done to police-Maori relations.

It is a suburban development situated south west of Charing Cross. Nearby places include Surbiton, New Malden, Old Malden, Tolworth and Chessington. Berrylands railway station is 24 minutes from London Waterloo by train. History Berrylands is a settlement of Anglo-Saxon origin that is close to the Thames. Berrylands originally formed part of the Municipal Borough of Surbiton, however in 1965 it was incorporated as part of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. Most of the present housing development took place in the 1930s on the former Berrylands Farm. The Surbiton Lagoon lido opened in 1934, but later closed in 1980, and then demolished at the end of the decade.Surbiton Lagoon was built in 1934 closed in 1980, and then demolished in the late 1980s ] This area was subsequently transformed into a park now owned and managed by Kingston Council, known as Berrylands Park,Kingston Council - Berrylands Park with a small area to the south developed into housing, creating Meldone Close.London Gardens Online - Berrylands Park Etymology Berrylands is a place-name that misleadingly suggests \\"land where berries grow\\". It actually means \\"land on a tumulus or hill\\", from Old English (modern dialectal \\"barrow\\" meaning \\"hill\\"), cognate with Old Norse , and which mean the same thing, and Old English land (\\"land\\"). The name was recorded as Berilendes in 1126, and as Berulind in 1148 (wrongly suggesting Old English \\"lime-tree\\" as the second element), and more recently as Barrilands in 1378, which shows the true origin as being from Old English . In a sense, the name corresponds to the modern English \\"Hill Farm\\", a common name for farms (and some new residences) across the United Kingdom. Housing, shops and transport There are four separate parades of shops, these are Alexandra Drive, Berrylands Road, Chiltern Drive and a smaller parade along Surbiton Hill Park. Chiltern Drive is at the centre of Berrylands, and houses over 22 businesses as well as the Berrylands public house, the Berrylands, known locally as 'The Berry'. The shops were built in the 1930s, and currently consist of a newsagents, doctors surgery, hairdressers, beauty salon, CCTV shop,Berrylands CCTV website barbers, coffee shop, printer and bookshop, as well as the Berrylands railway station. The neighbourhood is primarily residential. It houses a large commuter population using Transport for London travel routes, including two bus routes, the K2 and 665, and the Berrylands, Surbiton or Tolworth links to London Waterloo. The majority of houses in the neighbourhood were built in the 1930s and have features typicallyBBC ‚Äì Which era of house do people like best? found in housing stock of the inter-war period.

Geography Berrylands Station is the closest station to the sports ground of the London School of Economics and Political Science, which is in New Malden. There is a large water treatment plant on the opposite side of the railway. There are two parks in Berrylands Fishponds and Alexandra Park. Nature reserve In 2017 The Environment Trust acquired a grant for ¬£168,000 from Thames Water, to support a three-year community project enhancing the river habitat, creating wetland habitat, and improving the undermanaged woodland. In July 2018 a footbridge was opened to create a nature trail into previously inaccessible corners of the nature reserve.

It is often referred to as The Second Tindersticks Album to distinguish it from the band's first album, which was also called Tindersticks. It reached no. 13 in the UK Album Chart. On 17 September 2006, the album was performed live in its entirety at the Barbican Centre in London, as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.Concert details at 'Don't Look Back' website The concert was the last time the original six members of Tindersticks played together. Recording The band chose Conny's Studios in Cologne after a recommendation from Blixa Bargeld when Tindersticks were supporting Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on their tour of the UK in 1993. The group spent a week at Conny's Studios in May 1994 where most of the backing tracks for the album were recorded. On their return to London they enlisted the help of Terry Edwards for the string arrangements: \\"Sleepy Song\\" was recorded on a single microphone in one night at Abbey Road Studios on 30 June 1994, and the string sections were recorded a few days later at the same studio. The remaining recording sessions for vocals and additional instruments were done at Orinoco Studios in early July, and the album was mixed during July and August 1994 by the band and their engineer Ian Caple at the house the band shared, and at Studio 3 of Townhouse Studios.Discography of Tindersticks' second album on Tindersticks' official website Release The album was released in April 1995 on This Way Up in the UK and in August 1995 on London Records in the US As with their first and third albums, a remastered edition was released on Island Records in 2004 as a two-CD version, featuring the original album on the first disc and the live album The Bloomsbury Theatre 12.3.95 on the second disc. The album's first single, \\"No More Affairs\\", was accompanied by a video filmed at the Rivoli Ballroom in south-east London, and second single \\"Travelling Light\\" is a duet between Tindersticks' singer Stuart Staples and Carla Torgerson of The Walkabouts. The track \\"My Sister\\" features a spoken monologue from Isabel Monteiro, singer of the band Drugstore. Artwork The album's artwork features black and white photographs of the band being fitted for suits at Timothy Everest's atelier in London; the front cover shows guitarist Neil Fraser. The band's keyboard and accordion player David Boulter recalled in 2003 that \\"we'd always worn very ill-fitting second-hand suits, shirts, whatever, and, as a treat for our hard work, we arranged to have a tailor-made suit each. I could never be seen without my Timothy Everest suit for a long time after. Phil Nicholls took photos of the fitting, which became the sleeve.\\" Critical reception Like its predecessor, the album was well received by the critics. AllMusic said \\"Tindersticks' second consecutive, eponymously titled double-LP set refines the approach of their debut; while every bit as ambitious and adventuresome, it achieves an even greater musical balance, stretching into luxuriously long compositional structures and more intricate arrangements ... Another awesome triumph of mood and atmosphere.\\" Rolling Stone proclaimed that \\"their music is frequently as beautiful as it is brooding, and in the space between lies its enigmatic, enduring appeal\\". NME wrote that \\"time and again the 'Sticks weld crashing orchestral drapes onto the sparsest acoustic frames. What with Stuart Staples' inchoate mumbles veering towards the realms of self-parody, the initial impact is so understated as to be infuriating. Before long, however, the music's sheer otherworldly beauty acts like a virus and we're locked in, transfixed by the dreadful acts being perpetrated to and by these songs' characters ... the key to this immense, beguiling record: you can't aspire to Heaven unless you're well aware of Hell.\\" Melody Maker stated, \\"It's hard to explain just what a marvellous piece of work this record is ...The Tindersticks' Second Album contains gentle, tender crucifixions, nails through your heart, administered by a loving hand. Also the record is uncommonly beautiful. It has the unexpected contours and sudden perception-changing angles of the most dangerous and heart-stopping faces ... Tindersticks create cameos of such detail, such fidelity, that at moments you wonder if they have spies in every bedroom in the land. Like the lover it documents, The Tindersticks' Second Album is ravishing and complex, inexplicable and contradictory. It is compassionate and merciless. Gorgeous as sin. Buy it because you'll love it. Keep it because one day you'll need it.\\" =Accolades= Melody Maker ranked the album at no. 5 in their critics' list of the best albums of 1995.

He was a prolific author and influential mentor, and is credited with the introduction of a new geometrical approach to the theory of relativity. Background Synge was born 1897 in Dublin, Ireland, into a prominent Church of Ireland family. He attended St. Andrew's College, Dublin and in 1915 entered Trinity College Dublin. He was elected a Foundation Scholar his first year, which was unusual as it was normally won by more advanced students. While an undergraduate at TCD, he spotted a non-trivial error in Analytical Dynamics, a textbook by E. T. Whittaker, who had recently taught there, and notified Whittaker of the error.McCartney and Whitaker, p. 212. In 1919 he was awarded a B.A. in Mathematics and Experimental Physics, and also a gold medal for outstanding merit. In 1922 he was awarded an M.A., and in 1926 a Sc.D., the latter upon submission of his published papers up to then. In 1918, Synge had married Elizabeth Eleanor Mabel Allen (1896‚Äì1985). She was another student at TCD, first of mathematics, then of history, but family finances forced her to leave without graduating. Their daughters Margaret (Pegeen), Cathleen and Isabel were born in 1921, 1923 and 1930 respectively. The middle girl grew up to become the distinguished Canadian mathematician Cathleen Synge Morawetz. Synge's uncle John Millington Synge was a famous playwright. He is more distantly related to the 1952 Nobel prizewinner in chemistry Richard Laurence Millington Synge. He was a great-great-great-grandson of the mathematician and bishop Hugh Hamilton.Florides (2008) His older brother, Edward Hutchinson Synge (1890-1957), who was known as Hutchie, also won a Foundation Scholarship in Trinity for Mathematics, though he never graduated. While Hutchie's later independent research was long overlooked, he is now recognised for his pioneering work in optics, particularly in near field optical imaging.Donegan, J. F. (2012). \\"The Life and Works of Edward Hutchinson Synge\\" (co-edited with D. Weaire and P. Florides), P√∂llauberg, Austria : Living Edition, Hutchinson Synge - A Nanoscience Visionary Published by Trinity College Dublin, 30 March 2012 He died on 30 March 1995 in Dublin. Career in mathematics and physics Synge was appointed to the position of lecturer at Trinity College, and then accepted a position at the University of Toronto in 1920. From 1920 until 1925, Synge was an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto. There he attended lectures by Ludwik Silberstein on the theory of relativity, stimulating him to contribute \\"A system of space-time co- ordinates\\", a letter in Nature in 1921.E. Riehm & F. Hoffman (2011) Turbulent times in Mathematics, p. 80, American Mathematical Society Synge returned to Trinity College Dublin, in 1925, where he was elected to a fellowship and was appointed the University Professor of Natural Philosophy (the old name for physics). He was a member of the American Mathematical Society and the London Mathematical Society. He was treasurer of the Royal Irish Academy in 1929. He went back to Toronto in 1930, where he was appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics and became Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics. In 1940, he supervised three Chinese students, Guo Yonghuai, Chien Wei-zang and Chia- Chiao Lin, who later became leading applied mathematicians in China and the United States. He spent some of 1939 at Princeton University, and in 1941, he was a visiting professor at Brown University. In 1943 he was appointed as Chairman of the Mathematics Department of Ohio State University. Three years later he became Head of the Mathematics Department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, where John Nash was one of his students. He spent a short time as a ballistic mathematician in the US Air Force between 1944 and 1945. He returned to Ireland in 1948, accepting the position of Senior Professor in the School of Theoretical Physics at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. This school had been set up in 1940, and had several outstanding members, including Erwin Schr√∂dinger (who contributed to quantum mechanics), who was also a Senior Professor. His contributions Synge made outstanding contributions to different fields of work including classical mechanics, general mechanics and geometrical optics, gas dynamics, hydrodynamics, elasticity, electrical networks, mathematical methods, differential geometry, and Einstein's theory of relativity. He studied an extensive range of mathematical physics problems, but his best known work revolved around using geometrical methods in general relativity. He was one of the first physicists to seriously study the interior of a black hole, and his early workSynge, John Lighton. \\"The gravitational field of a particle.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

In pure mathematics, he is perhaps best known for Synge's theorem, which concerns the topology of closed orientable Riemannian manifold of positive sectional curvature. When such a space is even-dimensional and orientable, the theorem says it must be simply connected. In odd dimensions, it instead says that such a space is necessarily orientable. He also created the game of Vish in which players compete to find circularity (vicious circles) in dictionary definitions.Synge, Science: Sense and Nonsense, p. 23-24, p. 32. Honours Synge received many honours for his works. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1943. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, and in 1943 was the first recipient of the society's Henry Marshall Tory Medal, as one of the first mathematicians working in Canada to be internationally recognised for his research in mathematics. He was president of the Royal Irish Academy from 1961 until 1964. The Royal Society of Canada established the John L. Synge Award in his honour in 1986. John Lighton Synge retired in 1972. During his time at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, about 12% of all workers in the relativity theory studied there. Professor Hermann Bondi, who gave the first J. L. Synge Public Lecture in 1992, had this to say: \\"Every one of the other 88% has been deeply influenced by his geometric vision and the clarity of his expression\\". He was awarded the Boyle Medal by the Royal Dublin Society in 1972. During his long scientific career, Synge published over 200 papers and 11 books. He proved the result now known as Synge's theorem.

All operating systems include commands for deleting files (rm on Unix, era in CP/M and DR-DOS, del/erase in MS-DOS/PC DOS, DR-DOS, Microsoft Windows etc.). File managers also provide a convenient way of deleting files. Files may be deleted one-by-one, or a whole directory tree may be deleted. Purpose Examples of reasons for deleting files are: *Freeing the disk space *Removing duplicate or unnecessary data to avoid confusion *Making sensitive information unavailable to others *Removing an operating system or blanking a hard drive Accidental removal A common problem with deleting files is the accidental removal of information that later proves to be important. One way to deal with this is to back up files regularly. Erroneously deleted files may then be found in archives. Another technique often used is not to delete files instantly, but to move them to a temporary directory whose contents can then be deleted at will. This is how the \\"recycle bin\\" or \\"trash can\\" works. Microsoft Windows and Apple's macOS, as well as some Linux distributions, all employ this strategy. In MS-DOS, one can use the undelete command. In MS-DOS the \\"deleted\\" files are not really deleted, but only marked as deleted--so they could be undeleted during some time, until the disk blocks they used are eventually taken up by other files. This is how data recovery programs work, by scanning for files that have been marked as deleted. As the space is freed up per byte, rather than per file, this can sometimes cause data to be recovered incompletely. Defragging a drive may prevent undeletion, as the blocks used by deleted file might be overwritten since they are marked as \\"empty\\". Another precautionary measure is to mark important files as read-only. Many operating systems will warn the user trying to delete such files. Where file system permissions exist, users who lack the necessary permissions are only able to delete their own files, preventing the erasure of other people's work or critical system files. Under Unix-like operating systems, in order to delete a file, one must usually have write permission to the parent directory of that file. Sensitive data The common problem with sensitive data is that deleted files are not really erased and so may be recovered by interested parties. Most file systems only remove the link to data (see undelete, above). But even overwriting parts of the disk with something else or formatting it may not guarantee that the sensitive data is completely unrecoverable. Special software is available that overwrites data, and modern (post-2001) ATA drives include a secure erase command in firmware. However, high-security applications and high-security enterprises can sometimes require that a disk drive be physically destroyed to ensure data is not recoverable, as microscopic changes in head alignment and other effects can mean even such measures are not guaranteed. When the data is encrypted only the encryption key has to be unavailable. Crypto-shredding is the practice of 'deleting' data by (only) deleting or overwriting the encryption keys.

He is remembered for his Latin translations of Homer; but this versio Latina, in the view of modern scholarship, may have been his editorial version of a product of a tradition going back over a century of Latin translations for \\"crib\\" (reading aid) purposes. Translations His Latin translations of Homer published in 1537 (Venice) were extremely literal and ad verbum (i.e. word for word). While this was the first published version of the Iliad and Odyssey in Latin, the originality of the translation of Divus has been questioned: there are very close parallels with a much earlier translation by Leontius Pilatus. They were designed to be read with the Greek originals. There were two Venice editions of 1537, by Jacob a Burgofrancho and by Melchior Sessa; they share an introduction by Pier Paolo Vergerio, born at Capodistria.Robin Sowerby, The Homeric Versio Latina (PDF), at pp. 7-8 of PDF. They were later republished by the jurist Obertus Giphanius (Hubrecht van Giffen, 1534‚Äì1604) and then used by Jean de Sponde (Spondanus) in his 1583 Homer commentary on Greek and Latin versions. The Greek was the 1572 (Strassburg) edition of Giphanius. http://www.cairn.info/revue-d-histoire- litteraire-de-la-france-2003-3-page-707.htm What Spondanus included for Latin was not in fact the original translation of Divus, but a 1570 Geneva revision of it, with substantial changes.Sowerby They were used by George Chapman in his translations of the Iliad and Odyssey. In fact Chapman is considered to have used the Homer edition by de Sponde, which had parallel Greek and Latin text (the Latin derived from Divus), together with a Greek lexicon attributed to Johannes Scapula, a collaborator of the printer Henri Estienne.H.

The nearest railway station is southeast of the village at Rowlands Castle. The village had a population of 12,942 at the 2011 Census, and shares the semi-rural character of others in the district. The village was the home of Gales Brewery from 1850. In 2005, it was bought by Fuller, Smith and Turner, who closed it in 2006, when it was converted to shops and flats. History Horndean expanded in the early Middle Ages due to its convenient position as a staging post on the road from Portsmouth to London (now the A3). In 1836 it became home to the Hon. Sir Charles Napier Senior, father to the more famous Sir Charles Napier, who purchased a property in the village called The Grove but subsequently changed its name to Merchistoun Hall (named after his former home in Falkirk, Scotland). Merchistoun Hall is now a Grade II listed building and serves as the village's major community centre. Horndean was bypassed by main line railways but was served by trams of the Portsdown and Horndean Light Railway until 1935 and thereafter by buses. A three-storey workhouse was built during Victorian times to home the local poor. This stood on a site currently developed into a large retirement complex in 2017/18. This building had served a number of purposes including a local swimming pool. This was its primary function during the 1970s, provided by the use of a large polythene lined 'tank' on its ground floor. Using the pool was a fairly unpleasant experience by today's standards due to its small size, lack of poolside space and most of all - daylight. The first and second floors were used in latter years as a small lampshade factory. Defunct and dangerous, the entire building was demolished in spring 1982, leaving a small building http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Catherington/ entrance lobby that was closed and eventually demolished with the construction of the new retirement development in 2017. In the spring of 1944, British and Canadian troops were based around Horndean as they prepared for the D-Day invasion of Europe. Gunners of the 92nd (Loyals) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, were encamped in Hazleton Wood, near Merchistoun Hall. The village experienced significant expansion in the 20th century, particularly with the building of the Hazleton estate on the former grounds of Merchistoun Hall in the early 1960s, and the building of the A3(M) motorway in the 1970s, which passes under a bridge adjacent to the village centre. The easy access to the motorway has encouraged an influx of light industry to the village, most of it concentrated in three major estates, the most recent of which is Hazelton Interchange, built in the early 1990s. The centre of the village has a 1960s built small shopping precinct which is home to specialist businesses, as well as a cafe, fast food and newsagent. =Meaning of name= Dean refers to the old English word \\"denu\\" meaning valley, and the name Horndean most likely means \\"valley by a horn-shaped hill\\" (the horn-shaped hill probably being Horndean Down). Alternatively \\"Harne\\" is the old English word for Dormouse making it \\"valley of the Dormouse\\". The second part of the name, Dean, can also mean forest, giving rise to further connotations. Community Horndean's major community centres are Horndean Community Association at Merchistoun Hall and Barton Hall, Horndean Technology College. There is also a youth centre, RKdia. Other venues include Napier Hall, which was partially rebuilt in 2004, and the Jubilee Hall, opened in 2002. The two C of E churches in the area are Holy Trinity at Blendworth and All Saints in neighbouring Catherington. In 2020, Hampshire County Council announced plans to close Horndean library. The surrounding villages are Catherington, Cowplain, Blendworth, Rowlands Castle and Clanfield. Sport and leisure Horndean has a Non-League football club Horndean F.C., which plays at Five Heads Park. Twinning The village of Horndean has been 'twinned' with the town of Aubergenville in France since 1998. Various activities and exchange visits are organised by the Horndean Parish Twinning Association. * Aubergenville, France Politics Horndean is in the Meon Valley constituency for elections to the House of Commons and the South East England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.

The company was a manufacturer of linear and 2D handheld barcode scanners based on imaging technology. Its product range included rugged mobile computers, image kiosks, and barcode verification devices. Its range of data collection and communication products were designed for mobile, on-site, and transaction processing applications. In 2007, the company was subsumed into the Honeywell Group. History The Hand Held Products company, established in 1981 in Charlotte, North Carolina, began as a manufacturer of memory modules for Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments programmable calculators, and grew rapidly from 1983 thanks to an RFP hand-off by Hewett-Packard, as the package delivery company Federal Express selected their Micro-Wand portable data collection device to begin a proof of delivery system for package tracking. In 1996, Hand Held Products launched a mobile computer with 2D imaging technology, the Dolphin 7200. In 1997, the Hand Held Product's Dolphin portable computer was selected by the United States Postal Service to be part of their proof of delivery system, although a third party provided the manufacturing. The deal was the industry's largest ever single order, at 300,000 units. In 2006‚Äì2007 United States Postal Service started replacing these portable computers with Motorola portable computers (370,000 units), which had bar code reading hardware (2D imager) and decoding and image processing software designed and supplied by Hand Held Products. The company became HPP in late 1999, following a merger with Welch Allyn Data Collection, a subsidiary of Welch Allyn formed in 1972, which by the 1990s was manufacturing a complete line of handheld bar code readers. From then, the company had its company headquarters in New York. Hand Held Products had a significant presence in Europe, with its EMEA headquarters and European repair center in Eindhoven, Netherlands. It also has offices in the UK, Germany and France and sales representation and resellers in most countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Hand Held Products also has offices in Latin America and Asia. On January 1, 2005, the company dropped HHP as its brand name and returned to its original name Hand Held Products. On October 15, 2007, Hand Held Products announced they had agreed with Honeywell to be purchased for $390 million. On December 20, 2007 Honeywell‚Äôs acquisition of Hand Held was approved, and Hand Held became a new line of business within the Honeywell Security Group, initially called Honeywell Imaging and mobility. With Honeywell's acquisition of Metrologic in 2008 they renamed the business unit Honeywell Scanning and Mobility.

Home of Bod√∏/Glimt and Grand Bod√∏, it holds a capacity for 5,635 spectators. The venue has three stands: a modern all-seater with roof, 100 club seats and 15 luxury boxes to the south, an unroofed all-seater to the east and an older grandstand with mixed sitting and standing to the north. The venue has floodlights and artificial turf with under-soil heating. Immediately south of the venue lies Aspmyra kunstgressbane, a training pitch with artificial turf. Aspmyra Stadion has hosted one Norway national football team match, against Iceland in 2002. The venue opened in 1966 as a municipal multi-purpose stadium which included a running track. Glimt reached the top-flight in 1977, and played Cup Winners' Cup matches in the late 1970s at Aspmyra. The venue had a slight upgrade in 1980, which also saw the laying of all-weather running track and the construction of the training pitch. In 1992, the pitch was resowed, forcing Glimt to play a season in Nordlandshallen, which since has been used twice for Norwegian top division matches. Aspmyra Stadion was sold to Glimt in 1997, followed by the construction of the south and east stands. This involved removing the running track and building commercial and residential properties around the venue. Artificial turf was laid in 2006. After the club received illegal public subsidies in 2008 had to upgrade the venue, it was in 2011 sold back to the municipality. History After the establishment of Bod√∏/Glimts in 1916 and Grand Bod√∏ the following year, the clubs played at various locations throughout the town. The primary venue for the clubs' elite teams was Bod√∏ Station. By 1962, plans had surfaced for a central stadium for the prime sports clubs. The interest spurred a large protest meeting organized by the various sports clubs in town in support of the municipality building a new venue. Two locations were considered: at Plassmyra, now the location of the Norwegian Aviation Museum, and at Aspmyra. The latter was chosen and the plans were passed by the municipal council in 1963. Construction started in 1965, with the completion of a grass pitch, a running track and a grandstand consisting of wooden benches for 2,500 spectators. Steel terraces were built on the outer parts of the grandstand site and the other long side. To the south of the stadium, Glimt built an air-supported training hall, which they named Glimtbobla ('The Glimt Bubble'). The inaugural match at Aspmyra was played in 1966 between the boys' teams of Glimt and Grand in 1966. In 1980, an all-weather running track was installed and a training pitch with artificial turf, named Aspmyra kunstgressbane, was built south of the stadium. Kick-off during a 2008 Tippeligaen match between Bod√∏/Glimt and Lillestr√∏m. Behind is the old North Stand, and between the stand and the pitch the remains of the all-weather running track In 1989, a project was started to bring Bod√∏/Glimt back to the top league. Among the most important issues was to secure better training facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter.Arntzen (1994): 41 The club proposed upgrading the artificial turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch.Arntzen (1994): 43 The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the artificial turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK 3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the artificial turf pitch and remove the turf. New artificial turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club would not be allowed to play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch,Arntzen (1994): 44 which was taken into use in 1990. Construction of Nordlandshallen‚Äîan indoor football venue for winter training‚Äîstarted in 1990Arntzen (1994): 60 and was completed on 21 September 1991.Arntzen (1994): 62 In 1991, the debate regarding laying a new pitch at the stadium resurfaced. NFF granted permission for Glimt to use Nordlandshallen for the 1992 season, on condition that Aspmyra was ready for use for the 1993 season. The municipality lacked funds for a new pitch, so the parties agreed that the club would borrow NOK 3.5 million to pay for the renovation. The club would pay the interest on the loan until it was taken over by the municipality, but until then, Bod√∏/Glimt would not pay rent on the stadium. If the municipality was to finance the renovation in a regular manner, funds could not be allocated until the following year, which would cause two seasons to be lost. The new pitch included under-soil heating.Arntzen (1994): 45 In 1994, Bod√∏/Glimt started making plans to expand Aspmyra to allow it to host UEFA matches. The company Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling was established to finance the project and own the stands. Details were presented in 1996, which consisted of the company being given the Aspmyra lot, worth NOK 15 million, from the municipality. The initial plans called for seated stands for 10,000 spectators‚Äîa quarter of the town's population‚Äî48 apartments and of commercial property. Funding was proposed to come from selling the residential and commercial properties and grants from NFF and the Ministry of Culture. The project also included new floodlights and a new club house. The municipal chief of administration, Svein Blix, stated that the project would also have to pay for the operation of the new venue and the construction of a new athletics venue, as the plans called to remove the running tracks at Aspmyra. The municipality gave the necessary permissions for construction in December 1997, but required that the club finance the upgrades, which the club could not afford. Kjell Ove Johansen, CEO of Bod√∏/Glimt's operating company, quit his job in November 1998 in protest against the mayor's and councilors' negative attitude and lack of trust towards Bod√∏/Glimt regarding the venue plans. On 27 January 1999, the municipal council passed a resolution allowing the venue to be sold to the club for NOK 7.9 million, with the official take-over date being 1 May. In addition, the company would pay NOK 5.5 million to the municipality at a later date, after the venue had become profitable. Thiago Martins scoring on a penalty kick against Sogndal in a 2007 Norwegian First Division match. The west end of the stadium lacks stands. Construction started in October 1999, costing NOK 140 million. A new south stand was built with a roof, offices and change rooms, while a smaller stand without a roof was built to the east. The project cost NOK 40 million less than the original plans, in part because no stands were built on the west end. The two new stands had 4,350 seats and the venue was approved for UEFA matches. However, the venue was not allowed to use the old grandstand seating or the terraces for UEFA matches. The two new stands gave the stadium seating for 6,100 and standing room for 2,000 spectators. The first match at the upgraded venue was played on 22 April 2001. The project also included of commercial property, which was rented out to 13 companies. The commercial part of the stadium was owned by Aspmyra N√¶ringsbygg, which was again owned by several local investors. The stadium received new floodlights, which were bought used from Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo for NOK 5 million. However, there were some initial complaints from Bod√∏ Airport as the lights were a distraction for pilots. The club also considered installing artificial turf, and applied to be UEFA's partner to receive a grant to install a pilot turf, but this was instead awarded to Eyravallen in Sweden. On 2 December 2002, Nordlandsbanken bought a third of the shares in Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling from the club, for NOK 10 million, to avoid that the club went bankrupt. In 2003, Bod√∏/Glimt's spent NOK 650,000 on rent and NOK 700,000 in operating costs for the venue. As compensation for removing the track and field sections, the stadium company had to pay for a new municipal athletics venue at M√∏rkvedlia. The sales stadium's contract also required Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling to build new change room facilities for the training pitch so the uses from teams had the same quality as the main pitch. The company was criticized by the municipality in 2002 for not prioritizing this obligation. The NOK 170,000 it cost to move Grand's club house and build a change room for the artificial field was covered jointly by the municipality, Grand, Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling and one of Glimt's sponsors, Nordland Entrepren√∏r. In 2003, Aspmyra N√¶ringseiendom converted its debt, then NOK 20.5 million, to Swiss francs. Because of the transaction, within a year the company's debt had increased by 10 percent. In 2004, the stadium ownership company changed its name to Aspmyra Stadion AS. The municipality eliminated the stadium company's debt of NOK 5.5 million to the municipality in November 2005. This allowed the club's operating company to have a positive share capital and the club was thus allowed to keep its license. In May 2006, the grass pitch was replaced with artificial pitch, costing NOK 3.1 million. The training pitch received new turf in 2007. Following Glimt's promotion to the top league in 2008, the club stated that Aspmyra was \\"out of date\\" and that investments for NOK 200 million was necessary if the club was to remain in the top tier. Chair Benn Eidissen stated that while Aspmyra was among the country's most modern venues in 2001, it would within a few years no longer be in the top-25. He identified funding from regionally differentiated payroll tax (DA-funds), public grants and funding for sponsors as the main sources of financing. Imminent upgrades to the venue for NOK 10 million were done ahead of the 2008 season‚Äîfinanced using DA-funds. It consisted of two specific grants, a NOK 2.2 million subsidy and a ten-year NOK 8.3 million interest and installment-free loan, both to the club. In 2009, the bank deleted NOK 5 million of the stadium debt, reducing it to NOK 14.2 million. In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who administrated the DA-funds, stating that both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license to play in the top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality. The municipal council voted on 17 February 2011 to purchase the stadium. The strongest proponents were the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, while three parties, the Progress Party, the Liberal Party and Red Party, voted against. The proponents argued that municipality was purchasing the venue with a much higher value than what they had sold, while the opponents argued that it was not the municipality's responsibility to give financial first-aid to a professional sports club. The cost was NOK 16 million, paid for by taking over debt. After taking over the stadium company, the municipality merged it with Bod√∏ Spektrum, which runs an indoor sports complex, including Nordlandshallen. This allows the debt to be taken over by the municipality without interfering with the municipal accounts. Facilities Glimt supporters on the East Stand The venue is located in the southern part of the town center of Bod√∏, on H√•logalandsgata, close to Bod√∏ Airport. The venue has a capacity for 7,354 spectators. The South Stand has 15 luxury boxes, each with seating for 12 people, and club seating for an additional 100 people in Aspmyra Sportsbar; this is only available for corporate sponsors. Both the sports bar and the boxes have access to dinners before the match. The stand is combined with a commercial and residential building, which is owned by Aspmyra N√¶ringsbygg, which is again controlled by Gunvald Johansen. Bod√∏/Glimt's offices are located in this section, which along with the public access is rented by Glimt. Of sponsorship reasons, the South Stand is named for Diadora. The North Stand is the oldest part of the venue and is owned by Aspmyra AS. For sponsorship reasons, it is named after Nordlandsbanken. The area behind the East Stand was bought by Bod√∏ Boligbyggelag, who built housing there and is named after Toyota, again for sponsorship reasons. In 2010, the operating costs of the venue were NOK 2 million. Events Bod√∏/Glimt are the main tenant at Aspmyra. The record attendance dates from 1975, when 12,189 people attended a Norwegian Football Cup match against Viking. From the 1977 season, Bod√∏/Glimt played in the First Division, then the top tier of the pyramid. The club remained in to the top flight until it was relegated after the 1980 season.Fagerli and Lunde (1999): 345 Glimt had a poor spell during the 1980s, playing several seasons in the Third Division. On 5 October 1986, Aspmyra hosted the final of the Junior Football Cup between Bod√∏/Glimt and Lillestr√∏m. At the end of 1991, Glimt was promoted to the First Division, then the second tier of the pyramid. However, in the 1992 season, the club played at Nordlandshallen. From the 1993 season, Bod√∏/Glimt again played in the top flight. Twice, in 1993 and 1997, the final match of the season had to be played in Nordlandshallen because of the poor condition of the turf. Following the installation of floodlights in 2001, the attendance increased by 70 percent at floodlighted evening games, resulting in an increase in the use of evening matches during the spring and fall. Glimt remained in the Premier League until the end of the 2005 season, when they were relegated. They returned again for the 2008 season, but were relegated after the 2009 seasons. Aspmyra was used for UEFA Cup Winners' Cup matches in the late 1970s. Bod√∏/Glimt played Napoli in 1976‚Äì77, and Union Luxembourg and Internazionale in 1978‚Äì79. During the 1990s, Bod√∏/Glimt was allowed to play qualification matches for UEFA tournaments at Aspmyra, but the venue was not suitable for games in the ordinary rounds because of lack of floodlights. In the 1994‚Äì95 Cup Winners' Cup, Glimt played Olimpija Rƒ´ga at Aspmyra, but had to play against Sampdoria at Ullevaal Stadion. The team's 1996‚Äì97 UEFA Cup match against Trabzonspor was played at Ullevaal, although the qualification match against Beitar Jerusalem had been played at Aspmyra. Similarly, in the 1999‚Äì2000 UEFA Cup, the qualification against Vaduz was played at Aspmyra, while the first round match against Werder Bremen was played at Lerkendal Stadion in Trondheim. With an upgraded venue, Bod√∏/Glimt was again allowed to play all their home matches in UEFA tournaments at Aspmyra. In the 2004‚Äì05 UEFA Cup, Bod√∏/Glimt was visited by Levadia Tallinn and Be≈üikta≈ü. In addition to Bod√∏/Glimt, Grand Bod√∏ also plays matches at Aspmyra. This includes their women's team, which has previously played in the Women's Premier League. They most recently played in the top league in 2007, when they drew an average 222 spectators. During the 1980s, Grand's men's club became the town's best, playing in the Second Division, the tier above Glimt. The venue hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships in 1980. The following year, it held the women's semi-final in the 1981 European Cup in Athletics. Aspmyra has hosted one Norway national football team match, which resulted in 1‚Äì1 against Iceland and filling the venue with 8,126 spectators on 22 May 2002. This still stands as the venue's record attendance after the rebuilding. In August 2007, the Norwegian women's U-23 team played Sweden at Aspmyra. Concerts held at the venue include Bryan Adams in 2008. In September 2012, the venue hosted the final of the Norwegian rugby league championship between Bod√∏ Barbarians and Oslo Capitals, which the Capitals winning 34‚Äì24. Future In 2008, the club stated that they would either have to renovate Aspmyra for NOK 200 million or build a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level. Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants, including DA- funds. As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016, Bod√∏ Municipality and Bod√∏/Glimt proposed that Bod√∏ could build a stadium at R√∏nvikjordene, in the northern part of the town. The plans were presented in late July 2008; the venue was planned to have a capacity for 30,000 to 35,000 spectators, but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10,000 to 15,000. It was estimated that Bod√∏/Glimt would need a capacity for 10,000 to 15,000 spectators. In comparison, the population of Bod√∏ was 46,049 in 2008. The new venue was estimated to cost NOK 500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA-funds. Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application. Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch. Bod√∏ was discarded for the Scandinavian bid, which ultimately was never sent to UEFA. For Aspmyra, the municipality has stated that they have the long-term option to purchase the real estate north of the pitch and can build a new stand there. Alternatively, an estimated NOK 3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a commercial property.

It should not be confused with the CopyControl computer software copy protection system introduced by Microcosm Ltd in 1989. Several types of protection existed. While basically intended as a means of copy-protecting compact discs, Copy Control discs cannot properly be referred to as CDs because the system introduces incompatible data, making the discs non-compliant with the Red Book standard for audio CDs. The system is intended to prevent digital audio extraction (\\"ripping\\") from the protected discs, and thus limit the file sharing of ripped music. The techniques used are: * Multisession (Blue Book) information is included which effectively hides the audio tracks from most CD-ROM drives; * Error-correction codes for the audio data are corrupted, which may introduce audible errors to ripped copies. * The data area of the disc usually includes DRM-restricted copies of the audio content, for which a player only exists on the dominant PC operating system, Microsoft Windows. In the Netherlands, the record labels Sony and Universal experimented with copy control until 2004. EMI kept using it until June 2006, when they dropped it. In the United States, Universal Music Group experimented with copy control on a few soundtracks in 2001 and 2002, but abandoned it afterwards; Warner Music Group has only used it in Europe on such releases as Red Hot Chili Peppers' Greatest Hits and Madonna Music. As of September 2006, Cactus Data Shield, the Macrovision technology behind Copy Control, is no longer listed as a product on Macrovision's website and has completely been abandoned in countries such as Australia.Macrovision - Copy Protection, Software Licensing, and Digital Rights Management A December 2006 issue of Billboard magazine announced that EMI had decided to abandon Copy Control worldwide. Until then, it had been unclear whether EMI had completely abandoned it. There was no press release.  Background  The Copy Control protections were devised in response to the file sharing and casual CD copying that has become commonplace in recent years, allegedly causing the music industry significant losses, or \\"ungained\\" revenues. Neither issue was particularly relevant when the CD standard was introduced in the early 1980s, and thus, unlike the more recent DVDs, the CD standard specifies no inherent form of copy protection or other digital rights management. Copy Control is one of a number of attempts to apply copy protection on top of the CD standard, but since it is merely a modification of the already unrestricted standard that must still yield usable results in most CD players, the efficacy of the system varies significantly. Nevertheless, EMI's labelling of some Copy Controlled discs attempted to override consumers' statutory rights with the disclaimer \\"except for defective product resulting from the manufacturing process, no exchange, return or refund is permitted\\".  Circumvention  A Copy Control disc will appear as a mixed-mode disc, with audio and data content. Under Windows, inserting the disc will usually autorun an audio player utility, which plays the DRM-protected audio files provided. This can be temporarily disabled by holding down the shift key while inserting the disc on Windows XP and earlier, users of Windows Vista and 7 may simply choose not to run the DRM content. The ability to extract the CD-Audio tracks is otherwise largely dependent on the disc drive used. The first obstacle is the \\"fake\\" Table of Contents (ToC), which is intended to mask the audio tracks from CD-ROM drives. However CD-R/RW drives, and similar, can usually access all session data on a disc, and thus can properly read the audio segment. The other major obstacle is the incompatible (and technically corrupted) error- correction data. Again, the effect of this is dependent on the disc drive; some drives will be able to read the data without problems, but others will produce audio files with loud pops every few seconds. As a consequence of having faulty error-correction codes, the discs may be less resilient to anything that might cause a read error, such as dust and scratches resulting from normal use. Copy Control also does not prevent copying a disc by recording it as analog audio through a computer's sound card, which only causes a slight degradation in audio quality. More substantial is the loss in recording speed. This weakness, inherent in all digital copy prevention systems, is known as the \\"analog hole\\". As an alternative that does not rely on the \\"analog hole\\", it may be possible to copy the content using a digital link while playing it through a sound card that has a digital audio output. Usually a CD-R/RW drive will play the disc but with occasional stops (about every 10 seconds) and DVD-R/RW drives will be able to read the data without problems and can be ripped straight to the PC. CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drives in a computer will usually refuse to play the data except in the provided player. Systems other than Windows can just as easily play Copy Control discs, as many players on Windows are proprietary and respect the copy-restrictions. Similarly, the auto-launchers are only written for Windows and will only ambush Windows users (this can be mitigated by disabling autorun). There is little that can be done to stop a user who is not running Windows or who is using non-Microsoft CD ripping software from ripping a Copy Control disc. In Linux, Copy Control discs are easily accessed through cdparanoia or any other software that uses it, such as the KDE \\"audiocd:/\\" service. In Mac OS X, these discs are easily accessed through iTunes and QuickTime (When a CDDA track is dragged to a folder other than the CD, QuickTime automatically converts it to AIFF, which is a lossless PCM format).  Content on the CD extra  ;CDS-100 or CDS-200 :A player and a media file database (a copy of the audio contents in Windows Media). The player will only play the audio contents in the media file database. ;CDS-300 :A player and the anti-copy program only. The player can ignore the anti-copy program to read the audio tracks. The player allow users to play the tracks, rip the audio tracks as DRM-enabled WMA files and burn CD for 3 times (The player will rip the CD as 320 kbit/s WMA files, then burn the audio on a CD-R, notice that the volume is lower and the quality is worse on the burned CD).

He was born in Edinburgh, and was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. He is remembered primarily for his books The Harmonious Circle, The Occult Underground (originally titled Flight from Reason), and The Occult Establishment. In 1980 his important biography of G. I. Gurdjieff, titled The Harmonious Circle, was published. He spent 8 years researching the book, making contacts with the Gurdjieff community worldwide. The New York Review of Books described Webb's research and knowledge of the subject as \\"extremely comprehensive\\",Rosemary Dinnage, \\"The Great Mystifier\\", The New York Review of Books, 23 October 1980. and Mistlberger described the book as \\"scholarly and occasionally gossipy\\" with Webb being \\"unquestionably a sincere researcher\\" who became \\"deeply involved in the matter of his subject\\" while remaining \\"fundamentally an outsider, an investigative journalist\\".P. T. Mistlberger, \\"The Three Dangerous Magi: Osho, Gurdjieff, Crowley\\", 2010, pages 327 & 397. Tamdgidi wrote that, amongst all the biographers of Gurdjieff, \\"only Webb claimed to have been independent and outside the circle of Gurdjieff's followers\\", and in 2004, in Inventors of Gurdjieff, Paul Beekman Taylor described The Harmonious Circle as \\"the first systematic biographical account by a writer who hadn't known Gurdjieff personally\\"Mohammad H. Tamdgidi, \\"Gurdjieff and Hypnosis: A Hermeneutic Study\\", Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. Pages 15 & 17. Webb established that Gurdjieff's writings revealed substantial evidence of familiarity with the languages and cultures of central Asia, but Webb regarded Gurdjieff more as a self-taught innovator than a member of an esoteric Asiatic group, and, although seeing some of its forms having derived from Asia, saw the content of his teachings deriving from western occult traditions.K. Paul Johnson, \\"Initiates of Theosophical Masters\\", State University of New York Press, 1995, p140. Webb's theories of Gurdjieff's identity as a Russian foreign agent in Central Asia,Gary Lachman, \\"Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen\\", 2008, Quest Books, pp124-125. and theories on where he actually travelled before 1917, are considered controversial points in The Harmonious Circle. Webb's work challenges theories of secularism, theories of decline in organised religion and spirituality. Webb argued that the 19th and 20th centuries had also been marked by a revolt against the Enlightenment, and that the rise of irrationalism was much more marked than the rise of rationalism, especially before, during and after the First World War and the Second World War. Webb traced the influence of occult and mystical groups and writers on literature, philosophy and politics. Webb was generally ignored in his lifetime, but with the increasing rise of New Age spirituality in later years, his work now seems increasingly prescient. After increasing mental health difficulties, Webb committed suicide in 1980. Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke has lauded him as a serious researcher of occultism: \\"By focusing on functional significance of occultism in political irrationalism, Webb rescued the study of Nazi occultism for the history of ideas.\\"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism: The Ariosophists of Austria and Germany 1890‚Äì1935, originally published in 1985 by the Aquarian Press in Wellingborough, England His major works The Occult Underground and The Occult Establishment were translated into German and published in 2009 and 2008 respectively.

He served as head of the physics laboratory at Sweden's Radiumhemmet from 1924 to 1937, when he became head of the department of radiation physics at the Karolinska Institute. He played a pioneering role in the measurement of doses of radiation especially in its use in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In later years, he focused his research on the biological effects of repeated exposure to low doses of radiation. In 1964, he founded the International Radiation Protection Association, serving for a time as its chairman. He also chaired the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. He invented a number of instruments for measuring radiation doses, the most widely known being the Sievert chamber. In 1979, at the Conf√©rence G√©n√©rale des Poids et Mesures (General Conference on Weights and Measures or CGPM), the SI unit for ionizing radiation dose equivalent was named after him and given the name sievert (Sv).

During the 1920s, Tex Rickard was the leading promoter of the day, and he has been compared to P. T. Barnum and Don King. Sports journalist Frank Deford has written that Rickard \\"first recognized the potential of the star system.\\" Rickard also operated several saloons, hotels, and casinos, all named Northern and located in Alaska, Nevada, and Canada. Early years Rickard was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His youth was spent in Sherman, Texas, where his parents had moved when he was four. His father died and his mother then moved to Henrietta, Texas while he was still a young boy. Rickard became a cowboy at the age of 11, after the death of his father. At the age of 23, he was elected marshal of Henrietta, Texas. He acquired the nickname \\"Tex\\" at this time. On July 2, 1894, Rickard married Leona Bittick, the daughter of a Henrietta physician. On February 3, 1895, their son, Curtis L. Rickard, was born. Leona Rickard died on March 11, 1895, and Curtis Rickard died on May 4, 1895. Alaska In November 1895, Rickard went to Alaska, drawn by the discovery of gold there. Thus he was in the region when he learned of the nearby Klondike Gold Rush of 1897. Along with most of the other residents of Circle City, Alaska, he hurried to the Klondike, where he and his partner, Harry Ash, staked claims. They eventually sold their holdings for nearly $60,000. They then opened the Northern, a saloon, hotel, and gambling hall in Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. Rickard lost everything‚Äîincluding his share of the Northern‚Äîthrough gambling. While working as a poker dealer and bartender at the Monte Carlo saloon and gambling hall, he and Wilson Mizner began promoting boxing matches. In spring 1899, with only $35, Rickard (and many others) left to chase the gold strikes in Nome, Alaska. While in Nome, he met Wyatt Earp who was a boxing fan and had officiated a number of matches during his life, including the infamous match between Bob Fitzsimmons and Tom Sharkey in San Francisco on December 2, 1896. The two became lifelong friends, though for a brief period of time, they were competing saloon owners in Nome, where Rickard owned the Northern hotel and bar. In 1902, Rickard married Edith Mae Haig of Sacramento, California. They had one daughter, Bessie, who died in 1907. Edith Rickard died on October 30, 1925, at her home in New York City. Nevada By 1906, Rickard was running the Northern saloon and casino in Goldfield, Nevada. In Goldfield, he promoted professional boxing match between Joe Gans and Battling Nelson. The gate receipt of $69,715 set a record. A year later, Rickard opened the Northern Hotel in Ely, Nevada. Rickard also organized the Ely Athletic club and was the owner of several mining properties in the Ely area. In December 1909, Rickard and John Gleason won the right to stage the world heavyweight championship fight between James J. Jeffries and Jack Johnson. Rickard planned to hold the fight on July 4, 1910, in San Francisco, however opposition from Governor James Gillett and Attorney General Ulysses S. Webb caused Rickard to move it to Reno, Nevada. Rickard and Gleason made a profit of about $120,000 on the fight, which was won by Johnson. South America On February 18, 1911, Rickard announced that he was \\"through with the business of prize fighting\\" and set sail for Argentina. There, he acquired between 270,000 and 327,000 acres in Paraguay to start a cattle ranch. Rickard managed the ranch for the Farquhar syndicate, whose land holdings in South America total over 5 million acres. At its peak, the ranch consisted of about 1 million acres and had between 20,000 and 50,000 head of cattle. In 1913, Rickard's ranch was involved in a political controversy between Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil. Two of his employees were killed by Bolivian soldiers stationed in the disputed territory. That same year, Rickard accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on part of the Roosevelt‚ÄìRondon Scientific Expedition. The cattle business failed by the end of 1915 and Rickard's loss was stated to be about $1 million. Return to boxing In 1916, Rickard returned to the United States. On February 3, Jess Willard agreed to Rickard's offer to fight Frank Moran in New York City. The fight was held on March 17, 1916, at Madison Square Garden, then in its second incarnation, at 26th Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan. The $152,000 in gate receipts set a new record for an indoor event and the purse was the largest ever awarded for a no decision. Rickard promoted the July 4, 1919 fight between world heavyweight champion Jess Willard and Jack Dempsey in Toledo, Ohio. The fight only drew 20,000 to 21,000 spectators (the area seated 80,000) and the total receipts were estimated to be $452,000. After expenses, Rickard made a profit of $100,000. After the Willard‚ÄìDempsey fight, Rickard began bidding for a title match between Dempsey and Georges Carpentier. The Jack Dempsey vs. Georges Carpentier fight took place on July 2, 1921, in a specially built arena in Jersey City, New Jersey. The bout, which drew a record crowd of 90,000, was the first-ever boxing fight to produce a million dollar gate (at a then record of $1,789,238) as well as the first world title fight to be carried over on radio. Rickard's profit on the fight was reported to be $550,000. On July 12, 1920, shortly after the Walker Law reestablished legal boxing in the state of New York, Rickard secured a ten-year lease of Madison Square Garden from its owner, the New York Life Insurance Company. He promoted a number of championship as well as amateur boxing bouts at the Garden. His largest gate at the Garden came from the Jack Dempsey‚ÄìBill Brennan fight on December 14, 1920. The Benny Leonard‚ÄìRitchie Mitchell and Johnny Wilson‚ÄìMike O'Dowd fights also drew well. In addition to boxing, Rickard hosted a number of other events, including six-day bicycle races, and constructed the world's largest indoor swimming pool at the Garden. On February 17, 1922, Rickard was indicted on charges of abducting and sexually assaulting four underage girls. He lost his license to make and promote boxing matches in New York State and gave up control of the Garden. Rickard was found not guilty on one of the indictments on March 29, 1922, and the others were dropped as a result. After the trial, Rickard's attorney, Max Steuer, accused two workers of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children of demanding $50,000 from Rickard in exchange for the girls changing their testimony at trial; however, the district attorney could not find any evidence to corroborate this claim. On May 12, 1923, Rickard promoted the first boxing card at Yankee Stadium. It drew 60,000 spectators (a then-record crowd for a boxing bout in New York state) and made $182,903.26, which was donated to Millicent Hearst's Milk Fund. On September 14, 1923, Rickard promoted his second million dollar gate when around 100,000 people attended the Jack Dempsey vs. Luis √Ångel Firpo fight at the Polo Grounds. In September 1924, Rickard promoted the fight between Luis √Ångel Firpo and Harry Willis in Jersey City. The fight was attended by 60,000, but the paid attendance was only 48,500. Rickard lost $5,005 on the bout. On March 19, 1925, Rickard was convicted of violating a federal law that prevented the interstate transportation of fight films. He faced jail time, but was instead fined $7,000. In 1926, Rickard promoted the Jack Dempsey‚ÄìGene Tunney fight at Sesquicentennial Stadium in Philadelphia. The bout attracted a world record crowd of 135,000 and brought in a record gate of $1.895 million. He also promoted the rematch, now known as The Long Count Fight, which was held on September 22, 1927, at Soldier Field in Chicago. This fight brought in the first $2 million gate ($2.658 million) and was the first of feature a $1 million purse. Madison Square Garden On May 31, 1923, Rickard filed incorporation papers for the New Madison Square Garden Corporation, a company formed for the purpose of building and operating a new sports arena in New York City. In 1924 he purchased a car barn block on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. He acquired the rights to the name Madison Square Garden, as the building's owners planned on tearing it down and replacing it with an office building. Thomas W. Lamb was selected to design the new building. Destruction of the car barns began on January 9, 1925. The new arena opened on November 28, 1925. The first event was the preliminaries for the annual six- day bicycle race. It hosted its first major event on December 11, 1925, when a record indoor crowd of 20,000 attended the Paul Berlenbach-Jack Delaney fight. The $148,155 gate broke the record for an indoor boxing event. In January 1926, Rickard purchased WWGL radio, which he moved to the Garden and renamed WMSG. Following the success of the New York Americans in the Garden's first year, the Madison Square Garden Corporation decided to establish a second team, this one controlled by the corporation itself. The new team was nicknamed \\"Tex's Rangers\\" and later became known as the New York Rangers. Other ventures Rickard sought to repeat the success of the Madison Square Garden by building seven \\"Madison Square Gardens\\" around the country. In 1927, a group led by Rickard signed a 25-year lease for a sports arena at the new North Station facility in Boston. The Boston Garden opened on November 17, 1928. In 1929, Rickard and George R. K. Carter opened the Miami Beach Kennel Club greyhound track. They also planned a number of other ventures, including a jai-alai grounds adjacent to the kennel club and a horse track on an island in Biscayne Bay. Rickard also hoped to someday to build a hotel and casino that would rival those in Monte Carlo. Personal life Rickard met Maxine Hodges, a former actress 33 years his junior at the Dempsey‚ÄìFirpo fight. The couple married on October 7, 1926, in Lewisburg, West Virginia. On June 7, 1927, the couple's daughter, Maxine Texas Rickard, was born. Woodlawn Cemetery On December 26, 1928, Rickard left New York for Miami Beach, Florida, where he was completing arrangements for a fight between Jack Sharkey and Young Stribling and attending the opening of the Miami Beach Kennel Club. On New Year's Eve, Rickard was stricken with appendicitis and was operated on. Rickard died on January 6, 1929, due to complications from his appendectomy. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, NY. Investigations into the untimely and suspicious nature of the death of not one but two wives remain unsolved.

Bryndza cheese is creamy white in appearance, known for its characteristic strong smell and taste. The cheese is white, tangy, crumbly and slightly moist. It has characteristic odor and flavor with a notable taste of butyric acid. The overall flavor sensation begins slightly mild, then goes strong and finally fades to a salty finish. Recipes differ slightly across countries. In Slovakia, bryndza serves as the main ingredient to bryndzov√© halu≈°ky, which is regarded as the national meal and speciality. Etymology Known as juht√∫r√≥ in Hungarian, –±—Ä—ã–Ω–∑–∞ in Russian, brenca in Serbian, Brimsen in German, and ◊ë◊®◊ô◊†◊ñ◊¢ in Yiddish, bryndza, a word borrowed from Romanian br√¢nzƒÉ (\\"cheese\\"), is used in various countries throughout Ukraine and the EU, due to its introduction by migrating Vlachs. Though the word br√¢nzƒÉ () is simply the generic word for \\"cheese\\" in Romanian, there is no special type of cheese associated with it. It is a word presumably inherited by the Romanian language from Dacian,Ion I. Russu, Limba traco-dacilor, Editura ≈ûtiin»õificƒÉ, 1967Ariton Vraciu, Limba daco-ge»õilor, Timi≈üoara: Editura Facla, 1980 the language of the pre-Roman population in modern-day Romania. Outside Slovakia and the flanking regions of Southern Poland, it is still popular nowadays in the Czech Republic under the Czech spelling \\"brynza\\". History The word was first recorded as bren√ße, described as \\"Vlach cheese\\", in the Croatian port of Dubrovnik in 1370. Bryndza was first recorded in Kingdom of Hungary, in 1470 and in the adjacent Polish Podhale in 1527. In Slovakia, bryndza serves as the main ingredient to bryndzov√© halu≈°ky, which is regarded the national speciality (halu≈°ky - small gnocchi - are mixed with bryndza and topped with fried chops of fatty bacon). Bryndza is therefore regarded as typically Slovak product. The modern version of the soft spreadable bryndza is believed to have been developed by entrepreneurs from Star√° Tur√° (Western Slovakia) toward the end of the 18th century who founded bryndza manufactures in mountainous regions of Central and Northern Slovakia where sheep cheese production had deep roots in the local cheese manufacturing tradition, and traded with it, popularizing bryndza all around the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy. In Austria, it was called Liptauer, after the northern Slovak Liptov region. The Viennese speciality Liptauer, a savoury cheese-based spread, has replaced bryndza with common cows' milk cottage cheese because the original Slovak bryndza disappeared from Austrian market after the disintegration of Austro-Hungarian monarchy.

Nov. 9, 2010. MGoBlue.com. Retrieved June 26, 2013. In times when punting on third down was fairly common, teams would line up in the short punt formation and offer the triple threat of punt, run or pass. Harper's Weekly in 1915 called it \\"the most valuable formation known to football.\\" The formation is similar to the single wing and modern shotgun by including the possibility of a long snap from center. However, it is generally a balanced formation, and there are backs on both sides of the tailback, offering better pass protection. As a result, it was considered a much better passing formation than running, as the premiere running formation was the single wing.http://www.billsbackers.com/proform1.htm That said, it was regarded as a good formation for trap plays. History A play showing the short punt on offense and defense, and the quarterback under center The formation was invented by Amos Alonzo Stagg in 1896. Andy Smith, coach of California's \\"Wonder Teams\\" summed up the short-punt philosophy with his motto of \\"Kick and wait for the breaks.\\" In the early days of the sport the ball was often moved up the field, not through offensive plays, but rather through punting. Once the opposing team got the ball, the defense was relied upon to make the other team's offense lose yards or fumble. To confuse the opponent and attain longer punts, the punting was often done on first or second downs and it was not uncommon for a team to kick more than 40 times in a game. The formation was used extensively by Fielding Yost's \\"point-a-minute\\", hurry up Michigan Wolverines in their early history, as well as his disciple Dan McGugin's Vanderbilt Commodores.

It was released in August 1999. It is based on the 7th Sea tabletop role-playing game setting of Th√©ah. Setting In the 7th Sea CCG, players take the role of naval captains in the fantasy-Restoration world of Th√©ah. The game attempted to capture the feeling of a Hollywood pirate battle, complete with huge galleys, cannon-shot exchanges, and daring sea boardings. The game also has aspects of adventuring, treasure seeking, and the occult. As with most of the games of AEG, 7th Sea had a complex storyline that affected and was influenced by the RPG setting. The results of tournaments would function to guide the storyline, and the storyline in turn would be used to create new cards. Basics The game had many interesting concepts, including multiple winning conditions and a unique swashbuckling- themed combat system. The most important aspects were deck building, rules, and storyline. =Terms= The game used a number of terms to describe elements of game play: * Faction: The many factions in the game corresponded either to the navies of Th√©ah's different nations, pirates, or other independent fleets. Almost every crew character belonged to a faction, though some were unaligned and thus available to be used by any player. * Captain: The leading character on a ship and most important crewmember. Captains followed special rules and were often central to the faction's storyline. * Ship: There were many ships with various abilities. Each player would use one ship for the entire game, as well as one captain and crew. Faction ships could only be used with a captain of the corresponding faction, while unaligned ships were available to anyone. * Crew: The rest of a ship's characters. A player could build a crew from all factions but the starting crew could not consist of a faction distinct from the ship. * Seas: The environment of the ship. Five pre-constructed cards delineated the game space. * Tack: When a card's ability was used for the turn, it was turned sideways and could not be used again. This was called 'tacking.' Tacking also resulted from damage. =Cards= The six types of cards in 7th Sea were: Actions, Crew, Adventures, Attachments, Chanteys and Ships. Each card is played differently as explained below. Crew The most important card type in 7th Sea is Crew. This card type combines the traditional CCG concepts of both a resource type and a creature type. Most CCGs use some kind of card type to produce resources that they subsequently use to gain other items. Usually those resources do not contribute to anything else. Examples of this are lands from Magic: The Gathering and holdings from Legend of the Five Rings. Most games also have some kind of creature card that provides offence and defense, like M:TG's creatures and Doomtown's Dudes. The game combined both while also providing multiple resource types and multiple combat procedures. Crew are the sailors you have hired to man the ship. Your Captain is a special and important kind of crew but he still performs in much the same way any other crew. Crew cards have the following statistics: ** Cost: This is the amount of Influence (a type of resource, much like 'mana' in Magic: the Gathering, or 'gold' in Legend of the Five Rings) that you must provide to hire that crew and a measure of the card's overall power. ** Faction: This symbol denoted the faction this crew belongs to. Crews without a symbol were unaligned. ** Cannon: This statistic represented the crew's skill with a cannon. Its primary function was to perform cannon attacks upon other ships, simply by tacking a crew with more than 0 cannon ability. ** Sailing: This statistic represented the crew's skill at sailing. A crew with sufficient sailing ability could tack to move the ship by one sea. ** Adventuring: This statistic represented the crew's abilities in exploration and adventuring. This skill was mostly used to complete the requirements for Adventure cards, which would then bestow benefits upon that crewmember, the ship, or upon the player in other ways. ** Influence: A measure of a crew's wealth, charisma, and diplomatic skills. Influence is required to hire more crew, and as a result, it is the most important ability in the first few turns of the game. ** Swashbuckling: This measures the ability of the crew to repair the ship, in effect providing \\"damage soak\\" and how effective the crew is at M√™l√©e. This translates as damage (hits) inflicted from a successful boarding attack. Crews also had various traits that allowed them to use certain cards. Some of the most common traits were: ** Swordsman: The crew's skill in m√™l√©e measured with a number (+1, +3 etc.). It translates as extra damage in boardings, and it allowed the crew to attach swordsman school attachment cards. All captains had some level of Swordsmanship. ** Heroic/Villainous: These mutually exclusive traits revealed a crew's \\"way of life\\". There were various cards that were compatible with one of these two traits. For most of the history of the game, Villainous was considered a better trait to have on your Captain, since it gave access to easy card draw. ** Sorcery: There were various types of sorcery in the world of Th√©ah, and various crew could use them as attachments. However those attachments had a specific sorcery requirement of a certain level (0‚Äì2) that the crew had to have to attach them. Each ship had a limited amount of space for crew and that meant that smaller ships usually had lower resource and offensive capabilities. Usually this was balanced out with different benefits, like stronger special abilities and lower sailing costs. Players usually chose crew for their deck depending on their style and their faction's strengths, usually focusing on one or two statistics and maybe a trait (like sorcery). Crew with sailing or swashbuckling were always useful due to their innate use on movement and damage soak, however players also focused on more than one or two of the other three skills, Cannon, Adventuring, and Influence so as to be able to use specific cards more easily. Decks which focused on many skills together were the most difficult to build, however a good player then had a much greater versatility. Crew cards had a Punch as their boarding attack. Actions Action cards are the surprises you can spring on an unsuspecting opponent. They are one-use cards that have some immediate effect. In 7th Sea, action cards had two costs. One was for the player and the other for his target (the canceling cost) and it was in the form of Skill: number. Costs are paid by tacking one or more crew with the appropriate skill, until the number is fulfilled. The canceling cost was there for the target of the action, and it allowed him to cancel the action by paying it. Thus some pretty powerful cards could be balanced by having a lower canceling cost. Cost and cancel need not use the same skill. Action cards came in two types, Acts and Reacts. Acts are cards a player used in his turn. They usually worked to provide some unexpected effect, such as a combined cannon attack or an unstoppable boarding. Reacts are the much more common form of action cards. They can only be played on specific triggers such as an augment to a cannon attack, or suffering hits instead of a boarding attack. All decks employed action cards, and usually the more aggressive decks employed a greater number. Action cards' boarding attack could either be a Dagger or a Slash. Attachments Attachment cards are default enhancing cards for your other cards (the other being adventures). After the player pays the cost, he chooses an appropriate card to attach it to. Usual targets for attachments were: ** Crew: Attachments ranged from pistols and earrings, to parrots and spells. ** Ship: Ship attachments usually modified the ship in some way, such as a treasure hold, better sails, figureheads (usually specific to factions) etc. Some ship attachments had the drawback that they took up crew space. ** Sea: Sea attachments usually were ports, monsters, and allies you could employ. These often required a specific sea. Usually attachments had some kind of trait that classified it, such as Item, Henchman, Pet, Swordsman School, etc. For example, a pistol would be an Item while Rum Runners would be an Ally. These traits were used to specify targets for other cards. In later sets requirements for attachments became more frequent. Those requirements ranged from a skill level (Cannon 4), to the alliance to a faction (e.g. Crimson Rogers), to the existence of a trait (Villainous), or a trait at a specific level (e.g. Porte 2). Due to the speed of attachments, they usually had a much lower reward/cost ratio than adventures. Attachment cards' boarding attack was a Club. Adventures This is the second type of card a crew could attach. Adventures are the usual stuff of Hollywood pirate or naval adventure films: ancient relics, captured damsels, sea monsters, etc. These cards were almost exclusively completed by the use of the adventuring skill and were defined by the following: ** Seas away: Adventures did not automatically attach to a crew, but rather to a sea. When played, an adventure was placed a number of seas away from your ship (usually 1 to 3). To complete an adventure, your ship had to be on the same sea as the Adventure. This served as a balance factor for the more powerful or cheap adventures by forcing you to sail to the target sea to get it (something not always easy when opponents were waiting in the middle) ** Native sea: Most adventures had one specific sea in which it was much easier to complete them. This could range from a single point of adventuring lower for low-end adventures, to several points lower for the more costly ones. Then other adventures were easier to attach to specific crew, such a Villainous, Skeletal or Rose and Cross crew member. ** Reward: Adventure rewards usually increased a skill by a number of points with a high reward/cost ratio. However, in later expansions, Adventures started giving various effects, such as traits or special abilities. Although Adventures were attached to a Sea, they were only available to the player that attached them (barring other card effects). This was a nice way to \\"archive\\" uncompleted adventures without cluttering your hand. However, some cards punished rampant adventure archiving. Adventure Cards' boarding attack was a Thrust. Chanteys Chanteys were introduced later in the life of the game. They signified various global changes in the world of Th√©ah in the form of popular songs used by the populace. Chanteys were similar to actions. However their effects, contrary to action cards, were permanent. They could either affect only the player or an opponent, or it could affect all players. Chanteys worked in a way similar to terrains in Legend of the Five Rings or Omens in Legend of the Burning Sands. That is, only one Chantey could be in effect at any one time. At any time that a Chantey came into play, the former Chantey was discarded. More powerful Chanteys had, instead of a cancel cost, a discard cost that any player could use to get rid of the Chantey. Ships These cards are special in that they are not in the deck but rather start in play, along with your captain. Most ships belonged to a specific faction and could only be used by matching captains. Each ship was defined by its faction, crew maximum, and sailing cost. Crew maximum was used to determine the maximum number of crew you could have on your ship. Ships with a large crew maximum tended to be more powerful in the late game, but more vulnerable at the start. Sailing cost shows how easy a ship is to maneuver. Some action cards didn't use a fixed cost, but relied instead upon a ship's sailing cost (sometimes modified up or down). The advantage of a small ship was the fact that it could fill fast and press the offensive quickly. Seas The five Seas were always the same. They came with each starter box and were placed in a specific order. Seas had no specific abilities other than forming a game space for ships to move and for being the target of cards. Each captain has a specific starting sea which was usually chosen as a result of the storylines. New players often wondered where the other two seas which are not represented with cards were. The answer lies in the setting of the world of Th√©ah. The 6th sea is protected by a wall of flame and thus difficult to access, and the 7th sea is a mythical place and very hard to find. Neither of these two 'extra' seas played any major role in the card game. =Deck construction= Players make many choices when designing a deck. They must keep in mind both the captain's and ship's abilities, the faction's strengths and weaknesses, and the strategy they want to use. Even with the same Captain and Ship, it is possible to make completely different deck types. *Restrictions ** A player must first choose a captain. The captain determines the faction. ** A player must choose a ship of the same faction as the captain, or an unaligned ship. ** The deck may not be less than 60 cards including captain and ship. ** A deck may not have more than 3 copies of a single card. Strategies There are many different concepts for a deck and many different ways to achieve them, depending mainly on the faction and secondarily on the ship. For example, the Castilians were mainly a boarding faction (which means they liked to attack in m√™l√©e) but with the right construction it was possible to attack without boarding (by making ramming attacks and limited cannon). The original Castillian ship was a hulking galley but in later expansions they got a small fast ship that allowed them to perform a tactic which some called 'speed boarding'. Some sample deck foci are: * 'Atomic Cannon': These decks focused on sinking the opponent's ship with one big cannon attack. They usually had many adventures and actions to evade boardings. * 'Plinging': These decks focused on producing many small attacks, slowly forcing the opponent to tack all their cards, rendering them unable to take action against you. This was mainly achieved with cannon, but there were variations with spells. * Boarding: These decks focused on catching the opponent and entering boarding. They usually used big ships with lots of crew and had a nice spread of cards. * 'Speed Boarding': These decks focused on catching the opponent in a boarding during the first or early second turn. If they couldn't, they usually lost. The ships these decks used were small and had small sailing requirements. * 'Control': These rare decks tried to complete the secondary control victory condition. They were the harder decks to construct competitively. Even within these broad categories, there were many ways to carry out any given strategy. For example, a boarding deck might use only the captain to deal damage while the rest of the crew absorbed hits, or it might use small attacks with pistols and weak characters or it could just have a nice spread. One could use boarding action cards to enhance the attacks or to just absorb damage. One could also use attachments to win the attacks more easily, or adventures to inflict more damage etc. Combining various strategies was not uncommon, such as a boarding deck that used a big cannon attack before the boarding to soften the enemy. Game play =Start= At the start of each game, players used their captain's starting Wealth statistic to recruit their starting crew. Since the starting crew could be anyone from the deck, it was a nice tactic to have some backup crew in the deck for specific situations (much like a sideboard, only built-in). A captain's starting Wealth usually ranged from 7 to 10. Players typically chose a crew with high Influence statistics to start a game, although speed decks often preferred Sailing, Swashbuckling, and Cannon. =Phases= Each turn has 3 phases. The first phase is used to determine which player goes first; the second phase, the most important one, is where the game is actually played and the final phase is the end of turn were all resources are replenished (by untacking and drawing cards). Unlike in many games where a player performs as many actions as he wishes before passing to the next player, in 7th Sea each player performs only one action, and players pass to one another until none choose to take further actions. In the main phase, starting with the first player, each player performs an action or passes and then play proceeded clockwise to the next player. Actions can be playing an Action card from one's hand, using a printed ability on a card in play, or performing an action innate to the game like hiring crew, or performing a cannon attack. Once all players pass consecutively, the turn ends. The innate actions all players can perform in 7th Sea are: *Moving: By tacking Crew to produce Sailing points to equal or exceed the ship's sailing cost, a player can move his ship to an adjacent sea. *Cannon Attack: By producing any number of cannon with a single Crew, a player can inflict that number of hits on a ship in the same sea. *Hire Crew: If the ship has not reached its crew maximum, a player can reveal a crew from his hand and then produce equal or more influence than that crew's cost to recruit it. *Begin a boarding: By producing sailing equal to the ship's sailing cost, a player can attempt to begin a boarding against a ship in the same sea. *Complete an adventure: While in the same sea as one of his own adventures, a player can play all costs and attach the adventure to an appropriate target. =Boardings= Boarding is considered the most interesting phase of the game. Once begun, the involved ships lock together with their crews engaged in \\"cinematic m√™l√©e battle\\". While a player can escape a ship's cannons by running away, the only ways to disengage from boarding are with both players' consent or with a card effect. Accordingly, boarding decks are rewarded for the difficulty of engagement. Boarding occurs within the main phase of the game. During boarding, the rest of the game stops, so players can no longer play acts. Boarding consists of alternating boarding attacks between the two players involved. In turn, each boarding attack includes choosing a crew and sending it forward to attack (i.e. jumping to the other ship and causing some trouble). The defender can choose either to stand and take the hits (equal to the other crew's damage plus swordsman level) or to send someone forward to defend. Each card in the deck has three boarding boxes. The large attack box is first, with two smaller defend boxes below it. Each boarding box has one of the following actions: [C] (Club), [P] (Punch), [D] (Dagger), [S] (Slash), or [T] (Thrust). The attacker starts by playing a card from his hand to initiate his attack. If possible, the defender resists by playing a matching defence card from his hand (i.e. the defender's card must have a defend box matching the attacker's attack box). The defender immediately counter-attacks with the action in the attack box of that defending card. The original attacker then defends himself against the counter-attack. In effect, the exchange is reminiscent of a continuous cinematic \\"Thrust-Slash-Parry-Riposte\\" m√™l√©e. The m√™l√©e ends when either player cannot defend against an attack (i.e. the player's hand is empty, he chose the order of his attacks wrongly, or he has a bad boarding hand). The last attacking player wins the boarding attack, and the loser suffers hits. Boardings are interesting both because defenders can inflict hits and because the crews locked in m√™l√©e suffer hits first. Such early hits risk loss of either crews' captain (and thus the game) while the crew may still be in otherwise prime condition. Because of this, a player may choose to avoid starting a boarding attack by passing or by playing a react (e.g. firing a musket or getting drunk). When both players perform a boarding attack, they draw 3 cards each and the attacks continue. Since boarding boxes are spread in different card types, boarding decks usually have a wide variety of card types, unlike cannon and victory decks with few (two or three) card types. Thus, dedicated cannon decks can be caught helplessly in a boarding. =Death and destruction= Ships are fragile things. When a ship suffers hits, the crew is responsible for fixing it by tacking or sinking (getting killed). Hits cannot be ignored. When a captain sinks to absorb hits you lose the game. Players sometimes employed action cards to help them absorb hits. =Victory= In 7th Sea, there were two roads to victory. You could either sink all enemy ships, or perform a control victory (play several expensive cards, one in each sea). Storyline The game was a heavily story influenced game. Its factions had ties to specific RPG elements and rivalries and alliances occurred between them as the story progressed. The first story arc saw many serious conflicts, not necessarily all tied together. Storyline deaths were not uncommon (they didn't have some specific effect in the game), and the game even saw the death of an entire faction. =Factions= *Crimson Rogers: Bloodthirsty pirates led by the cruel and ruthless Captain Reis, the Crimson Rogers flew red sails and were feared more than any other faction, save perhaps the Black Freighter. Their motto was No Banter, No Barter, No Quarter. The Crimson Rogers have excellent cannon, adequate boarding and adventuring capabilities, but low influence. They are mostly Villainous. *Sea Dogs: More privateers than pirates, the Sea Dogs were sponsored by Avalon (a nation inspired by mythic England). They angered the Crimson Rogers, leading to the destruction of their ship and the near-death of their first captain Berek, the luckiest man alive. Bloody Bonnie McGee took the helm and sacrificed her life for a chance to take down Reis. The Sea Dogs have high influence and jack of all trades crew, without any particular specialisation. They dabble in Glamour sorcery and are primarily Heroic, being the only faction in the game with no villainous crew. *Castillians: Sailors from the nation of Castille (based on renaissance Spain), this faction was originally the enemy of the Montaigne, with whose nation they were at war. They later allied with the Montaigne faction to save their captain, Orduno. They were also allied with the Inquisition (the punitive, warlike arm of the church). Castillians are mainly a boarding faction with some cannon capabilities. *Montaigne: Montaigne (based on renaissance France) is the wealthiest nation and as a result they excel at many things. They usually employ Musketeers for sword fights and their fighting style employs the most tricks. Their original captain, the General, was a mercenary soldier from Eisen who was promoted as a pirate hunter. Their secondary captain was mainly preoccupied with bringing Montaigne's rivals, the Castillians, back in line. Montaigne have many good swordsmen and fighting tricks while also being very fast on the offensive due to their high influence. *The Brotherhood: The Brotherhood are escaped convicts from a Castillian prison who formed their own pirate nation. Their original captain, Allende, was recaptured, but later freed by Berek, who became the Brotherhood's new captain following his escape from Reis. The Brotherhood has high adventuring, giving them flexibility, but also making them weak to start, needing time to complete adventures. Later ships and captains with powerful abilities grant them greater playability. *The Explorers: The explorers were neither pirates nor allied with any nation. Their captain, Guy McCormic was obsessed with finding ancient Syrneth artifacts (the remnants of a lost high-tech civilization). At some point, after he sacrificed a crewmember to his passion, the rest of the crew mutinied and overcame him. Explorers have very high adventuring and sailing and are very good at escaping trouble. *The Corsairs: The only faction hailing from the Crescent Empire (inspired by the Ottoman Empire), the Corsairs are led by Kheired Din, a ruthless slavemaster who sacrificed his own crew to get results. The corsairs were hit hard story wise when their slaves rebelled and their leader, Espero, turned out to be a descendant of the lost Castillian royal bloodline. The second corsair ship was led by Ernesto Castillus (AKA Espero) whose actions were critical to the end of the storyline. Corsairs are very good at boarding, and have a very high damage absorption. *The Gosse's Gentlemen: A former legend once again picks up the sword and sails the seven seas along with his band of heroic gentlemen-pirates. Gosse had sworn to bring down the Black Freighter captained by the man who killed his wife. He achieved this aim, with the help of Ernesto Castillus, the sacrifice of his ship, and his own life. The Gosse had very high swashbuckling, and as a result they were very good at boardings, and to some extent, damage absorption. *The Vesten: The Vestenmannavnjar or Vesten (based on Vikings of the late Dark Ages) are raiders and warriors of an old tradition. Bitter over the betrayal by their greedy kinsmen, they hunt and loot any Vendel Trading ship they caught. Eventually betrayed from within, their captain Yngvild survived and hunted for revenge. The next captain was led by their betrayer and rival, Jorund. In keeping with their Viking inspiration, the Vesten specialise in boarding. Their cannon abilities are non-existent, but they make up for this with large amounts of damage-absorption. *The Black Freighter: The undead of 7th Sea sail on a massive ghost ship, the Black Freighter that gives them their name. Their original Captain, Necros was brought back to avenge his death at the hands of Gosse. The original crew consisted of undead versions of normal crew (the faction can't recruit non Black Freighter crew) and resurrected crew from the other factions. The first story arc ended with the death of Necros and his ship. The Black Freighter was an interesting faction since it relied on skeletal crew and fear cards. They could go for either boarding or cannon and usually mixed both. There were also a number of \\"unaligned\\" crew who belonged to no faction and so were usable by any Captain. Usually these were generic pirates, but some were given quite a bit of character and even included a handful of captains. =Story arc= The first story arc began with minor events and conflicts between the various factions and gradually progressed with events of greater importance which ended up changing the state of the world. Notable events include the rivalry between the Sea Dogs and the Crimson Rogers, which climaxed with the apparent death of Captain Reis at the hands of the Sea Dogs second captain; Bloody Bonnie McGee. There was also the appearance of the Black Freighter and its later defeat at the hands of Phillip Gosse by the sacrifice of his whole faction. And finally the Corsair's search for the final Syrneth switch which revealed the hidden island, Cabora, and their destiny. The second story arc didn't have enough time to be fully fleshed out but it started with the Montaigne Revolution and the capture of their former emperor. =Experience= As with most other AEG games, experience was a major factor in the game's progression. Experienced crew usually got stronger and costlier. Since 7th Sea had a lax uniqueness rule, usually experienced crew ended up becoming unique. Experienced crew sometimes ended up changing factions (Such as the experienced versions of killed crew becoming Black Freighter members) or gained some secret society allegiance. *Note that experienced crew could simply be hired without requiring their original version to already be in play, unlike evolved Pok√©mon for example. History of 7th Sea During the lifetime of 7th Sea, both the RPG and the CCG had a very loyal following. Players would often ask for a specific result in a storyline tournament while offering bounty to anyone who achieved it. The game may be cancelled, but a following of the game still exists with tournaments in major events and custom cards. =Expansions= The first base set of 7th Sea offered 6 factions for player to choose from, but later expansions revealed more factions. The game saw two more base sets and a final online-only set at its closing. *No Quarter (Original base set, featuring factions: Crimson Rogers, Explorers, Sea Dogs, Brotherhood, Montaigne, Castillian. 1999, 323 cards. Set icon: white cannon in profile on a black background. Winner of the 1999 Origins Awards for Best Trading Card Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Card Game or Supplement.) *Strange Vistas (First expansion, featuring factions: the Corsairs, Gosse's Gentlemen. 1999, 161 cards. Set icon: white sail on a pale blue background. Winner of the 1999 Origins Award for Best Card Game Expansion or Supplement.) *Broadsides (Identical reprint of No Quarter, except for six faction-specific cards. 1999, 323 cards. Set icon: white crossbones on green background.) *Shifting Tides (Second expansion, featuring factions: Vesten, Montaigne. 1999, 161 cards. Set icon: white crown on pale red background.) *Scarlet Seas (Third expansion, featuring factions: Crimson Rogers, Sea Dogs. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white crossed cutlasses on purple background.) *Black Sails (Fourth expansion, featuring faction: Black Freighter. 2000, 54 cards. Set icon: black sail on white background. Instead of randomized boosters, this expansion was sold in 50-card fixed distribution boosters.) *Fate's Debt (Fifth expansion, featuring factions: the Brotherhood, Corsairs. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white cannon in profile on a blue background.) *Reaper's Fee (Sixth expansion, featuring factions: Castillians, Vesten. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white crossbones on black background. Probably the hardest set to currently locate.) *Horizon's Edge (Seventh expansion, featuring factions: the Explorers, the Gosse's Gentlemen. 115 cards. Set icon: white crossed cutlasses on red background.) *Iron Shadow (623 cards. The second revision of the base set was arguably the biggest release of the game since it contained all the ships and captains while also having new versions of older cards to make them more playable and a new card layout. From this set forward, the use of set icons was discontinued in favor of printing the set's name at the bottom edge of each of its cards.) *Syrneth Secret (Eighth expansion, featuring factions: the Brotherhood, Montaigne. 2001, 169 cards.) *Parting Shot (54 cards. The final set of 7th Sea was released only in an online form and mainly to close the storyline and balance the factions. A Final gift from AEG to its loyal customers.) =Ghost Ship: The Death of a Game= Although 7th Sea seemed to be going very well sales-wise, there were some things that began to spell the end of the game. They were either easily avoidable or common blunders that have been known to end the life of many collectible card games. *The third release of the base set saw the reprint of many older cards with new abilities to increase their playability. While many players saw this as a good move (because it effectively increased their card base), others had a hard time keeping track of the changes while others didn't want to waste money on new versions of cards they already had. *A series of storyline tournaments in which the players themselves would mark a faction for death, The Gosse Faction was selected. Many players incorrectly believed this meant that no more Gosse crew and Gosse specific cards would appear in the game. *Late in its lifespan, 7th Sea also opted for \\"facelift\\", meaning, cards were reprinted, keeping 99% of the format, but with whole art design and background across. Conceptually this was a good move, but in practice it seemed to tire players to: adjusting to the new art, getting new copies of older cards to match new cards, etc. *A minor complaint arose in the last set being printed in the wrong size. *7th Sea's demise came with the success of AEG's new Warlord: Saga of the Storm CCG. AEG lacked the resources to support L5R, Warlord and 7th Sea, and as 7th Sea was the least successful of the three, it was retired to free up resources. =Present= The popularity of 7th Sea ‚Äì like that of related games such as Doomtown or Rage ‚Äì has waned, and new cards are no longer produced. However, many players continue to play in tournaments and even design new cards and sets. Because the RPG is maintained, there is still interest in the setting and a number of websites continue to support the CCG as well as the RPG. The game has also been ported to OCTGN for online play.

It is the dale of the River Swale on the east side of the Pennines in North Yorkshire. Geographical overview Fields Swaledale Gunnerside Swaledale runs broadly from west to east, from the high moors on the Cumbria‚ÄìYorkshire boundary at the watershed of Northern England to the market town of Richmond, where the dale meets the lowlands. Nine Standards Rigg, the prominent ridge with nine ancient tall cairns, rises on the watershed at the head of Swaledale. To the south and east of the ridge a number of smaller dales (Birkdale, Little Sleddale, Great Sleddale and Whitsundale) join to form the narrow valley of upper Swaledale at the small village of Keld. From there, the valley runs briefly south then turns east at Thwaite to broaden progressively as it passes Muker, Gunnerside, Low Row, Healaugh and Reeth. The Pennine valley ends at Richmond, where an important medieval castle still watches the important ford from the top of a cliff. Below Richmond, the valley sides flatten out and the Swale flows across lowland farmland to meet the Ure just east of Boroughbridge at a point known as Swale Nab. The Ure becomes the Ouse, and eventually (on merging with the Trent) the Humber. From the north, Arkengarthdale and its river the Arkle Beck join Swaledale at Reeth. To the south, Wensleydale, home of the famous Wensleydale cheese, runs parallel with Swaledale. The two dales are separated by a ridge including Great Shunner Fell, and joined by the road over Buttertubs Pass. Physical character Applegarth, near Richmond Swaledale is a typical limestone Yorkshire dale, with its narrow valley-bottom road, green meadows and fellside fields, white sheep and dry stone walls on the glacier-formed valley sides, and darker moorland skyline. The upper parts of the dale are particularly striking because of its large old limestone field barns and its profusion of wild flowers. The latter are thanks to the return to the practice of leaving the cutting of grass for hay or silage until wild plants have had a chance to seed. Occasionally visible from the valley bottom road are the slowly fading fellside scars of the 18th and 19th century lead mining industry. Ruined stone mine buildings remain, taking on the same colours as the landscape into which they are crumbling. Swaledale is home to many small but beautiful waterfalls, such as Richmond Falls, Kisdon Force and Catrake Force. Agriculture and industry Field Barn (\\"cow'us\\") diagram, in Muker Upper Swaledale Sheep-farming has always been central to economic life in Swaledale, which has lent its name to a breed of round-horned sheep. Traditional Swaledale products are woollens and Swaledale cheese, which was formerly made from ewe‚Äôs milk. These days it is made from cow‚Äôs milk. During the 19th century, a major industry in the area was lead mining carried out in Arkengarthdale and at Grinton Moor. Current human activities Swaledale Today, tourism has become important, and Swaledale attracts thousands of visitors a year. It is very popular with walkers, particularly because the Coast to Coast Walk passes along it. Unlike Wensleydale it has no large settlements on the scale of Hawes or Leyburn, nor an obvious tourist hook such as the former's connection with James Herriot, and so, like Coverdale, it enjoys a quieter tone, especially as it is more remote compared to, say, Wharfedale, which is much further south and easily accessible from the West Yorkshire metropolis. Walkers near a field barn in Muker In May and June every year, Swaledale hosts the two-week-long Swaledale Festival, which combines a celebration of small-scale music and a programme of guided walks. The first weekend in August sees the area host the 'Ard Rock mountain bike festival, which is based in Reeth but uses bridleways and private land in both Swaledale and Arkengarthdale. Since 1950, Swaledale has been the host of the Scott Trial, a British motorcycle trials competition run over an off road course of approximately 70 miles, raising money for the \\"Scott charities\\", a range of local non-profit making organisations. Ravenseat, the farm of Amanda Owen (\\"The Yorkshire Shepherdess\\"), is in Swaledale. Swaledale in literature In a letter to Geoffrey Grigson of 17 January 1950 W. H.

Dickson. The first book, based on the short story \\"St. Dragon and the George\\", was loosely adapted in the 1982 animated movie The Flight of Dragons by Rankin/Bass. The title here refers in part to an in-universe nomenclature, wherein the story's dragons use the name \\"george\\" as a synonym or substitute of \\"human\\", after 'St. George the Dragon-Slayer', and in part a reference to the latter. Characters  =Jim Eckert= Baron Sir James Eckert de Bois de Malencontri et Riveroak, a.k.a. \\"the Dragon Knight\\" or sometimes \\"Sir Dragon\\". The protagonist of the series, a minor academe originating in the 20th century, who to save his fianc√©e, Angela \\"Angie\\" Farell, follows her by astral projection to a parallel universe resembling medieval England, where his psyche is lodged in the body of a dragon named Gorbash. On consultation with the mystic Carolinus (see below), he is sent to rescue Angie from the immaterial evil known as the 'Dark Powers', and is mistitled a Baron by Carolinus (presumably to give him legal freedom of movement). At the end of The Dragon and the George, Jim regains his human form and obtains the land and titles of the deposed antagonist Sir Hugh, who re- appears later in the series. In The Dragon Knight, Jim rules the estate Malencontri, with Angie as his wife; but finds himself capable of becoming a dragon, without the intervention of Gorbash, and becomes Carolinus' apprentice to control this ability. Having learnt this control enables several extraordinary deeds in the service of England, and later makes Jim eligible to join the 'Collegiate of Magickians' whereof Carolinus is a founder (a subplot emphasised in later books). =Sir Brian Neville-Smythe= Jim and Angie's closest friend; an idealistic, impoverished, zealous knight, present as Jim's companion throughout the series. His understanding of the medieval world proves a great asset to Jim, who is occasionally perplexed by its customs. =Silvanus Carolinus= Jim's mentor, and one of the three highest-rated (AAA+) magicians in the world. In some ways the modern stereotype or archetype of a Wizard: an omniscient, irascible, talkative old man capable of altering reality almost at will, consulted by every species of life-form, and often in conversation with intangible 'Powers'. Identified in later books as a founder of the Collegiate of Magickians to which he belongs. Noted for addressing every character, including royalty, by personal names or nicknames, without reference to title, and for extensive knowledge of anachronisms. =Dafydd Ap Hywel= A Welsh longbowman, likely the greatest in the world, and Jim's ally. Descended in part from a long-extinct line of royalty, associated with the 'Drowned Hundred' of folklore. Married after the first book to the female archer known as Danielle. =Aragh (changed to Aargh in later books) = A wolf capable of speech and noted for an unrepentantly-abrasive character, distinguished by a strong nationalism, possessiveness of territory, and an unceasing pragmatism. Of exceptional size, by descent from the Dire Wolves. Able to move without being seen or heard, even when watched. Ally to all the main characters, including Jim. =Secondary characters= Lady Angela 'Angie' Eckert Betrothed and later married to Jim, Angie appears as a damsel in distress in the first book, and later as chatelaine of Malencontri. Her role has varying degrees of importance, in that being a lady, she is required to remain at her own estate while Jim is away; to oversee all that occurs in it; and to maintain custom and courtesy in all situations. When the action is set in Malencontri, she is Jim's inseparable companion. Most of the books end with their re-union after an arduous adventure. As a rule, Angie takes negative stimuli with more poise than Jim, who is continually frustrated by the situations he encounters. Gorbash A Western dragon of the 'Cliffside' dragon colony, whose body was initially inhabited by Jim Eckert until Jim could bring his 'george' form into the medieval world. Not a companion as much as an alternate form assumed by Jim. Later a friend to the latter among the Cliffside dragons. Smrgol The \\"maternal grand-uncle\\" of the dragon Gorbash, and thus in some degree Jim's grand-uncle as well. Advisor to Jim/Gorbash throughout the first book (in which the two share a body). Depicted as comically pompous, but possessed of great courage and able to overawe the other dragons of his colony in any debate. Killed in the first book fighting a 'renegade' named Bryagh, who had earlier given Lady Angela to the Dark Powers. Secoh A wetland-dwelling \\"mere-dragon\\": one of a subspecies reduced in size and strength by the presence of the Dark Powers. Fought alongside Smrgol to kill the dragon Bryagh. Though initially cowardly and weak, Secoh increases in confidence, and is one of Jim's vital allies among the dragon community. Giles o' the Wold An itinerant archer, and leader of a band of similar men. Responsible for skirmishing against the forces of Sir Hugh outside the immediate vicinity of the Loathly Tower, the headquarters of the Dark Powers. Danielle o' the Wold Archer, daughter to Giles o' the Wold, and close friend to Aragh. Married to Dafydd after the first book. Thereafter she is mentioned by name, but usually in connection with her husband and their children, who are said to be numerous. KinetetE A female Magickian, described as \\"cadaverous-looking\\" and therefore depicted as severe of manner, and close colleague of Carolinus, KinetetE appears as Jim's magical advisor whenever Carolinus is unavailable. She is equal in rank to the latter, and appears initially as his judge in a magical contest. Addressed familiarly by Carolinus and Angie as \\"Kin\\". Lady Geronde Isabel de Chaney Chatelaine of Castle Malvern, betrothed to Sir Brian while they both wait for her father (Sir Orrin) to return home for permission to marry. Depicted as martial in character. Married to Sir Brian in The Dragon and the Fair Maid of Kent. Sir John Chandos A powerful and intelligent knight, who often enlists Jim to conduct difficult and unusual missions. Considered very handsome by his contemporaries, and therefore sometimes the object of Jim's jealousy when seen as too familiar with Angie. Prince Edward Plantagenet The hot-tempered, but good- natured son of the King, later identified as the historical 'Black Prince'. Edward owes Jim and Brian his freedom from captivity by the renegade Magickian Malvinne, and is known to speak on their behalf before the King. King Edward III Plantagenet The weak-willed, alcoholic monarch of England. Although he is Jim's superior and generally can be considered an ally, the King is impulsive and indecisive; character traits which occasionally put James and Angela's lives in danger. May Heather A young, but brave and loyal kitchen maid at Malencontri. Sometimes a source of worry to Sir James and Lady Angela, but otherwise considered an asset. Rrrnlf A humaniform, amphibious Giant, identified in a dialogue as a \\"Sea Devil\\". Described as essentially cone-shaped, in that he is largest in diameter at the head, and narrowest at the feet, with each area of the body narrower than the one above it. An ally to Sir James and Lady Angela, and able to travel from any body of water to any other regardless of physical removal. Usually depicted as amiable, cheerful, and slightly simple-minded, as well as affectionate and respectful of all whom he encounters. Hob The castle hobgoblin at Malencontri, and therefore sometimes identified as 'Malencontri hob'. His role is essentially that of a brownie in relation to the larger castle; but he is also Jim's messenger among the other mythical creatures, and sometimes a source of information. Implied to be immortal; originally a true goblin banished from the 'Kingdom of Demons' for his refusal to take part in wars, some centuries prior to the story. Robert Falon Jim and Angie's infant ward, introduced in The Dragon, the Earl, and the Troll, and said in later books to supply, in Angie's mind, the need of a son. Sir Giles de Mer A Selkie, companion to Jim and Brian. =Villains= The Dark Powers A malicious force, chief antagonist of the series, having an especial grudge against humans and magicians, that unceasingly attempts to set the world into either boredom or chaos. Their power is centered at Loathly Tower and all immediate terrain, within England. Sir Hugh de Bois The former lord of Malencontri, much disliked by Aragh and Sir Brian. Betrayed England to enlist in the services of the Dark Powers, and later fled England, to re-appear in later books. Deposed by Jim/Gorbash and their allies. Notable for having scarred Lady Geronde, so that she remains 'disfigured' according to the standards of her society until her marriage to Sir Brian, whereat she is restored to her former appearance by an act of magic considered unusual by the other characters. The Earl of Cumberland The King's royal cousin. Power-hungry and ruthless, the Earl frequently attempts various plots to take the throne, even as far as attacking the mythical land of Lyonesse. The Earl regards the Dragon Knight and his companions as a constant annoyance to his schemes, which they consistently dismantle. Lady Agatha Falon The Earl's witch ally. Robert Falon's malevolent aunt. Shown as a relatively benign character in The Dragon, the Earl, and the Troll, wherein she is introduced; but depicted as malicious in later books. Bryagh Renegade dragon who left the Cliffside dragon community (whereof Smrgol and Gorbash were members) to serve the Dark Powers. Killed by Smrgol and Secoh. Malvinne A rogue magickian in league with the Dark Powers. A long-time rival of Carolinus. Defeated by Jim and company. Sandmirks Matriarchal, rodentine creatures that impel terror in their intended victims by production of high-frequency sound. These sounds have no effect on wolves, but take full effect on dragons and men alike. Harpies Flying creatures resembling those of classic mythology, whose bites contain lethal venom. Worm A large, mainly-featureless creature with thick skin and many rows of teeth. Defeated by Jim and Brian. Ogre A large, dim- witted, fireproof humanoid noted for impressive gripping power but limited movement at the shoulder. Smrgol and Jim/Gorbash are among a very few dragons to have slain one. Sea-Lizard or Sea-Serpent An amphibious reptile of tremendous size, considered traditional enemy of the dragons. One of these, by magical intervention, leads an invasion (in The Dragon at War) of England to destroy the dragons of England, but fails when fought and beaten by Jim Eckert. Granfer A Kraken, initially depicted as benign advisor to all marine and amphibious life; but later revealed to be ambitious, according to Carolinus, \\"to rule the world\\". It is Granfer that permits a large-scale invasion of England by the sea-serpents, and who connects them to the Italio- French sorcerer Julio Ecotti for this purpose. Banished by Carolinus. Ahriman A 'Great Demon', antagonist of The Dragon and the Djinn. Deep-Earth Goblins Antagonists of The Dragon and the Fair Maid of Kent, wherein they appear as a cause of the Black Death's proliferation in England, well before the accepted historic date. Especial enemies of the Castle Hobgoblins, whom they expelled from the 'Kingdom of Demons' centuries before the events of the books. =Other characters= Grottwold Weimar Hansen University professor of various qualifications, whose experiments in astral projection transported Angie, and later the psyche and memories of Jim, into the medieval period. Considered \\"an unsavory character\\" by Jim, owing to their former rivalry for Angie's hand in marriage. Jim's instructor in hypnosis. Dick Innkeeper Owner of an inn, of moderate importance to the first book. Son Won Phon Chinese Magickian, who appears initially in The Dragon at War to challenge Jim's use of hypnosis on grounds that the latter was \\"Oriental magic\\" and ought have been taught by \\"a qualified Oriental instructor\\". Disproven by Carolinus. Son later appears as a specialist consulted by Carolinus, and in extension thereof by Jim. Martti Lahti Finnish magician, of a moderate rank (identified as 'B+') slightly higher than that of Jim, who appears among those observing Carolinus' challenge by Son Won Phon, and who prevents the injured Sir Brian and Dafydd ap Hywel from hemorrhage. Amiable, easy-mannered, and slightly condescending toward Jim. Mnrogar Self-proclaimed \\"King of the Trolls\\", this is a large and ancient troll living underneath the castle of an Earl. Although solitary, he maintains dominance over all the trolls in the region, and is therefore considered their superior. Addressed by Agatha Falon as \\"Grandfather\\" by reason of the years she spent as his ward. =Entities= Auditing Department Intangibly-constructed, nearly-omnipresent entity of immense influence and wry humor, called the accounting office in later books, whose purpose is largely (though not exclusively) to monitor the use of magic by Magickians of the Collegiate, and thus to determine their right to accomplish certain magical feats. Usually appears as a \\"bass voice\\" approximately one meter from the ground, but can appear speaking from or through the local environment itself. Invoked by Carolinus early on, it does not take revenge on him for speaking to itself familiarly, but is addressed with deference by Jim.

It flows into the Nakdong River, which in turn flows into the Sea of Japan (East Sea). The river rises from Hwabuk-myeon in Sangju, and drains most of western Mungyeong and parts of northern Sangju. From tip to tail, it covers a total of 66.2 km¬≤ and drains an area of 913.7 km¬≤. The Yeong flows into the Nakdong at the southeastern corner of Mungyeong between Yeongsun-myeon and Sangju's Sabeol-myeon. During most of the 20th century, coal mines were widespread throughout the Yeong valley, and the quality of the river was heavily degraded. As the water has cleared in recent years, efforts have been made to improve the river's potential to support tourism. The river flows past Jinnam Bridge, which is known as one of the most beautiful places in North Gyeongsang and is a popular symbol of Mungyeong. In addition, rafting trips are now often organized along the Yeong. The river has also become a noted spot for recreational fishing for species including Korean aucha perch, catfish, dark chub, and pale chub.

Analogue transmissions continued on mediumwave with a restricted time schedule until 27 June 2011, when the mediumwave transmitter was taken out of service and replaced by a new longwave transmitter. The analogue transmissions on 243 kHz long wave will continue until at least the end of 2014. The old analogue long- and mediumwave reserve transmitter is known to have replaced the mediumwave and DRM transmitters on longwave from 16-31 October 2009, and the antenna tower for mediumwave is still standing.

Early life Douglas Hartree was born in Cambridge, England. His father, William, was a lecturer in engineering at Cambridge University and his mother, Eva Rayner, was president of the National Council of Women and mayor of the city of Cambridge. One of his great-grandfathers was Samuel Smiles; another was the marine engineer William Hartree, partner of John Penn.Richard Hartree, John Penn and Sons of Greenwich Douglas Hartree was the oldest of three sons that survived infancy. A brother and sister died in infancy when he was still a child, but his two brothers would later also die. Hartree's 7-year-old brother John Edwin died when Hartree was 17, and Hartree's 22-year-old brother Colin William died from meningitis in February 1920 when Hartree was 23. Hartree attended St John's College, Cambridge but the first World War interrupted his studies. He (and his father and brother) joined a group working on anti- aircraft ballistics under A. V. Hill, where he gained considerable skill and an abiding interest in practical calculation and numerical methods for differential equations, executing most of his own work with pencil and paper.Van der Kloot(2011). \\"Mirrors and smoke: A. V. Hill, his brigands, and the science of anti-aircraft gunnery in world war I. .\\" Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 65: 393‚Äì410. After the end of World War I, Hartree returned to Cambridge graduating in 1922 with a Second Class degree in natural sciences. Atomic structure calculations In 1921, a visit by Niels Bohr to Cambridge inspired Hartree to apply his numerical skills to Bohr's theory of the atom, for which he obtained his PhD in 1926 ‚Äì his advisor was Ernest Rutherford. With the publication of Schr√∂dinger's equation in the same year, Hartree was able to apply his knowledge of differential equations and numerical analysis to the new quantum theory. He derived the Hartree equations for the distribution of electrons in an atom and proposed the self-consistent field method for their solution. The wavefunctions from this theory did not satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle for which Slater showed that determinantal functions are required. V. Fock published the \\"equations with exchange\\" now known as Hartree‚ÄìFock equations. These are considerably more demanding computationally even with the efficient methods Hartree proposed for the calculation of exchange contributions. Today, the Hartree-Fock equations are of great importance to the field of computational chemistry, and are applied and solved numerically within most of the density functional theory programs used for electronic structure calculations of molecules and condensed phase systems. Manchester years Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. In 1929, Hartree was appointed to the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester. In 1933, he visited Vannevar Bush at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and learned first hand about his differential analyser. Immediately on his return to Manchester, he set about building his own analyser from Meccano. Seeing the potential for further exploiting his numerical methods using the machine, he persuaded Sir Robert McDougall to fund a more robust machine, which was built in collaboration with Metropolitan-Vickers. The first application of the machine, reflecting Hartree's enthusiasm for railways, was calculating timetables for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. He spent the rest of the decade applying the differential analyser to find solutions of differential equations arising in physics. These included control theory and laminar boundary layer theory in fluid dynamics making significant contributions to each of the fields. The differential analyser was not suitable for the solution of equations with exchange. When Fock's publication pre-empted Hartree's work on equations with exchange, Hartree turned his research to radio-wave propagation that led to the Appleton‚ÄìHartree equation. In 1935, his father, William Hartree, offered to do calculations for him. Results with exchange soon followed. Douglas recognised the importance of configuration interaction that he referred to as \\"superposition of configurations\\". The first multiconfiguration Hartree‚ÄìFock results were published by father, son, and Bertha Swirles (later Lady Jeffreys) in 1939. At Hartree's suggestion, Bertha Swirles proceeded to derive equations with exchange for atoms using the Dirac equation in 1935. With Hartree's advice, the first relativistic calculations (without exchange) were reported in 1940 by A. O. Williams, a student of R. B. Lindsay. Second World War During the Second World War Hartree supervised two computing groups. The first group, for the Ministry of Supply, has been described by Jack Howlett as a \\"job shop\\" for the solution of differential equations. At the outbreak of World War II, the differential analyser at the University of Manchester was the only full-size (eight integrator) differential analyser in the country. Arrangements were made to have the machine available for work in support of the national war effort. In time, the group consisted of four members (front to back: Jack Howlett, Nicholas R. Eyres, J. G. L. Michel; center, Douglas Hartree; right Phyllis Lockett Nicolson). Problems were submitted to the group without information about the source but included the automatic tracking of targets, radio propagation, underwater explosions, heat flow in steel, and the diffusion equation later found to be for isotope separation. The second group was the magnetron research group of Phyllis Lockett Nicolson, David Copely, and Oscar Buneman. The work was done for the Committee for the Co-ordination of the Valve Development assisting the development of radar. A differential analyser could have been used if more integrators had been available, so Hartree set up his group as three \\"CPUs\\" to work on mechanical desk calculators in parallel. For a method of solution he selected what is now a classical particle simulation. Hartree never published any of his magnetron research findings in journals though he wrote numerous highly technical secret reports during the war. In April 1944 a committee which included Hartree recommended that a mathematical section be set up within the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). In October this recommendation was put into effect with its first two objectives being the investigation of the possible adaptation of automatic telephone equipment to scientific equipment and the development of electronic computing devices suitable for rapid computing. One suspects that some members already knew of the Colossus computer. John R. Womersley (Turing's b√™te noire) was the first Director. In February 1945 he went on a two-month tour of computing installations in the USA, including visiting ENIAC (still not complete). He became acquainted with drafts of von Neumann's famous June 1945 EDVAC report. About two months later Hartree also went over to see ENIAC, not then publicly known. Later life and work In February 1946, Max Newman (who had been involved in the Colossus computer) submitted an application to the Royal Society for funds to start the task of building a general purpose computer at the University of Manchester. The Royal Society referred the request to Hartree and C.G. Darwin, Director of the NPL, to advise them. Hartree recommended the grant but Darwin opposed it on the grounds that Turing's ACE at NPL would be sufficient to serve the needs of the country. But Hartree's view won the day and the Manchester developments in computing were started. Hartree did further work in control systems and was involved in the early application of digital computers, advising the US military on the use of ENIAC for calculating ballistics tables. In the summer of 1946 Hartree made his second trip to ENIAC as an evaluation of its applicability to a broad range of science, when he became the first civilian to program it. For this he selected a problem involving the flow of a compressible fluid over a surface, such as air over the surface of a wing travelling faster than the speed of sound. At the end of 1945 or very early in 1946 Hartree briefed Maurice Wilkes of the University of Cambridge on the comparative developments in computing in the USA which he had seen. Wilkes, then received an invitation from the Moore School of Electrical Engineering (the builders of ENIAC) to attend a course on electronic computers. Before leaving for this, Hartree was able to brief him more fully on ENIAC. It was on the boat home that Wilkes planned the original design of EDSAC, which was to become operational in May 1949. Hartree worked closely with Wilkes in developing use of the machine for a wide range of problems and, most importantly, showed users from a number of areas in the university how they could use it in their research work. Hartree returned to Cambridge to take up the post of Plummer professor of mathematical physics in 1946. In October he gave an inaugural lecture entitled \\"Calculating Machines: Recent and Prospective Developments and their impact on Mathematical Physics‚Äù. This described ENIAC and the work that Hartree had done on it. Even in 1946, two years before stored programming electronic computing became a reality, Hartree saw the need for the use of sub-routines. His inaugural lecture ended with a look at what computers might do. He said: \\"..there are, I understand many problems of economic, medical and sociological interest and importance awaiting study which at present cannot be undertaken because of the formidable load of computing involved.\\" On 7 November 1946 the Daily Telegraph, having interviewed Hartree, quoted him as saying: \\"The implications of the machine are so vast that we cannot conceive how they will affect our civilisation. Here you have something which is making one field of human activity 1,000 times faster. In the field of transportation, the equivalent to ACE would be the ability to travel from London to Cambridge ... in five seconds as a regular thing. It is almost unimaginable.\\" Hartree's fourth and final major contribution to British computing started in early 1947 when the catering firm of J. Lyons & Co. in London heard of the ENIAC and sent a small team in the summer of that year to study what was happening in the USA, because they felt that these new computers might be of assistance in the huge amount of administrative and accounting work which the firm had to do. The team met with Col. Herman Goldstine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton who wrote to Hartree telling him of their search. As soon as he received this letter, Hartree wrote and invited representatives of Lyons to come to Cambridge for a meeting with him and Wilkes. This led to the development of a commercial version of EDSAC developed by Lyons, called LEO, the first computer used for commercial business applications. After Hartree's death, the headquarters of LEO Computers was renamed Hartree House. This illustrates the extent to which Lyons felt that Hartree had contributed to their new venture. Hartree's last famous contribution to computing was an estimate in 1950 of the potential demand for computers, which was much lower than turned out to be the case: \\"We have a computer here in Cambridge, one in Manchester and one at the [NPL]. I suppose there ought to be one in Scotland, but that's about all.\\" Such underestimates of the number of computers that would be required were common at the time. Hartree's last Ph.D. student at Cambridge, Charlotte Froese Fischer, would become world-famous for the development and implementation of the multi-configuration Hartree‚ÄìFock (MCHF) approach to atomic structure calculations and for her theoretical prediction concerning the existence of the negative calcium ion. He died of heart failure in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 12 February 1958.

She was originally US destroyer , and, like many other obsolescent U.S. Navy destroyers, she was transferred to the Royal Navy in 1940 as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Campbeltown became one of the most famous of these ships when she was used in the St. Nazaire Raid in 1942. Service history =As USS Buchanan= Starboard side view of Campbeltown as USS Buchanan in 1936 USS Buchanan was a destroyer, ordered from the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, and laid down on 29 June 1918. She was launched on 2 January 1919 and commissioned into the Navy on 20 January. She had a typical inter-war career, and was placed into the reserve in 1939. She then became one of 50 destroyers transferred to the Royal Navy in 1940 after the finalisation of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. She was transferred on 3 September 1940 and commissioned on 9 September at Halifax, Canada. =As HMS Campbeltown= Having been formally commissioned she took passage from Halifax to Plymouth, travelling via St. Johns, Newfoundland. She arrived at Devonport Dockyard on 29 September and was taken in hand for modifications to fit her for service with the Royal Navy. The refits lasted throughout October, and on completion of the final harbour trials on 1 November she was nominated to join the 17th Flotilla operating in the Western Approaches. The next day, while carrying out sea trials she collided with SS Risoy and sustained damage, but continued and arrived safely at Liverpool, where she underwent repairs from 7 to 24 November. She then joined the flotilla. On 29 November, she ran down and sank the British coaster in the Mersey Estuary. She began deploying with the flotilla in early December, but on 3 December she collided with SS Comus and had to put into port for repairs again. The repairs lasted until late March, and involved the shortening of the fourth funnel. Dutch sailors on HNLMS Campbeltown. On completion of the work on 28 March, Campbeltown was transferred on loan to the Royal Netherlands Navy as HNLMS Campbeltown, where she joined the 7th Escort Group and deployed with them in April‚ÄìMay. The Dutch proposed to rename her Middelburg, but this was not agreed as it would have been contrary to the naming agreed with the U.S. Navy. She underwent further repairs throughout June and resumed convoy defence with the group in July‚ÄìAugust. She was then nominated to be returned to the Royal Navy in September, but remained with the 7th Escort Group. She spent September working up with her Royal Navy crew and rejoined the group in October, where she covered convoys between Britain and West Africa. On 15 September she picked up the survivors of the Norwegian motor tanker Vinga, which had been damaged in an enemy air attack. She carried out escort duties in November‚ÄìDecember, before taking passage to Devonport to undergo repairs. The St Nazaire Raid HMS Campbeltown being converted Campbeltown began the Devonport repairs in January. During this time, she was selected for a special operation and was withdrawn from regular service for modifications. She was to be used in Operation Chariot, a planned assault operation on the docks at Saint- Nazaire. In 1942 the German battleship ‚Äîanchored at Trondheim in Norway‚Äîwas considered to present a grave threat to Atlantic convoys. Should Tirpitz enter the Atlantic, the Louis Joubert drydock at Saint-Nazaire‚Äîwhich had originally been built for the liner ‚Äîwas a vital target; it was the only German-held drydock on the European coast of the Atlantic that was large enough to service the battleship. If this drydock could be put out of action, any offensive sortie by Tirpitz into the Atlantic would be much more dangerous for the Kriegsmarine to carry out, making it less likely that they would risk deploying her. Operation Chariot was a plan to ram an explosive-laden warship into the dock gates. Accompanying her would be a number of small boats carrying British Commandos, who would destroy the dock's pumping and winding machinery and other infrastructure. The troops would then be evacuated by the small boats before the explosives in the ship detonated. A particular difficulty was that the dock was located several miles up the estuary of the Loire River. As an obsolescent destroyer, Campbeltown was considered to be expendable and was selected to be the ram-ship. She spent February undergoing modifications. These included removing her third and fourth funnels and having the remaining two funnels raked to simulate the structure and appearance of a German Raubvogel-class torpedo boat. A 12-pounder gun was installed forward and eight Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon were mounted on the upper deck. Some extra armour was provided to protect the bridge structure, and unnecessary stores and equipment were removed to lighten the destroyer. An explosive charge consisting of 24 Mark VII depth charges‚Äîcontaining a total of of amatol high explosive‚Äîwas fitted into steel tanks installed just behind the steel pillar that supported her most forward gun mount. The charges were to be detonated by multiple eight-hour time pencils connected together by cordtex, set before steaming out and cemented in to prevent any interference with the detonation. Campbeltown steamed from Devonport to Falmouth, Cornwall on 25 March to join the other ships that would take part in the operation. The crew‚Äîwhich would be evacuated with the commandos‚Äîwas reduced to 75 men, under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Stephen \\"Sam\\" Beattie. A flotilla of 21 vessels‚ÄîCampbeltown, 16 Fairmile B motor launches, one motor torpedo boat and a Fairmile C motor gun boat acting as the troops‚Ä≤ headquarters‚Äîleft Falmouth at 14:00 on 26 March 1942, escorted for most of the crossing to France by two \\"Hunt\\"-class escort destroyers. Apart from a brief clash with , whose captain misreported the task force's course and composition, the ships reached France unmolested. One motor launch suffered mechanical problems and had to return to England. The preliminary air raid carried out through heavy cloud by 35 Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys and 25 Vickers Wellingtons was much smaller than originally planned and was ineffective, merely alerting the defenders of something unusual happening. Nevertheless, by flashing genuine German recognition signals, the force, with Campbeltown flying the flag of the Kriegsmarine, approached to within less than of the harbour before being fired upon. Campbeltown‚Äîas the largest target‚Äîdrew most of the fire. During the final approach, the crew of Campbeltown lowered the emblem of the Kriegsmarine and hoisted the fighting ensign of the Royal Navy. German photo of HMS Campbeltown, taken before it exploded At 01:34 on 28 March, four minutes later than planned, Campbeltown rammed the dock gate. The Commandos and ship's crew came ashore under heavy German fire and set about demolishing the dock machinery. 169 of the raiders were killed (64 commandos and 105 sailors) out of the 611 men in the attacking force. Of the survivors, 215 were captured and 222 were evacuated by the surviving small craft. A further five evaded capture and travelled overland through France to Spain and then to Gibraltar, a British territory. The charges in Campbeltown exploded at noon, an hour and a half later than the British had expected. Although the ship had been searched by the Germans, the explosives had not been detected. The explosion killed around 250 German soldiers and French civilians and demolished both the front half of the destroyer and the caisson of the drydock, with the rush of water into the drydock washing the remains of the ship into it. The St. Nazaire drydock was rendered unusable for the rest of the war and was not repaired until 1947. The delayed-action torpedoes fired by the motor torpedo boat into the outer lock gate to the submarine basin detonated, as planned, on the night of 30 March. This later explosion led to panic, with German forces firing on French civilians and on each other. Sixteen French civilians were killed and around thirty wounded. Later, 1,500 civilians were arrested and interned in a camp at Savenay and most of their houses were demolished, even though they had had nothing to do with the raid. Lt-Cdr Beattie‚Äîwho was taken prisoner‚Äîreceived the Victoria Cross for his valour and in 1947 received the French L√©gion d'honneur. His Victoria Cross was one of five that were awarded to participants in the raid, along with 80 other military decorations. Legacy The ship's bell of HMS Campbeltown was given to the town of Campbelltown, Pennsylvania, as a gesture of appreciation towards the United States for the Destroyers for Bases Agreement program. This ship's bell was later lent by the town to the subsequent , a Type 22 frigate, when she was commissioned in 1989 and was returned on 21 June 2011 after HMS Campbeltown was decommissioned. The 1952 film The Gift Horse was loosely based on the story of HMS Campbeltown.

Biography Andrzej Potocki was the son of Hetman Stanis≈Çaw \\"Rewera\\" Potocki. In 1660 he became the Great ChorƒÖ≈ºy of the Crown and later the voivode of Kiev Voivodship (from 1668) and voivode of Krak√≥w Voivodship (from 1682). He distinguished himself in the battle of Khotyn, where he commanded the left wing of the royal army (1673). After the abdication of John II Casimir in 1668, he strongly supported the candidacy of the Tsarevich Feodor, for which he was disliked by other nobles. He was a member of the Confederation of Malcontents in 1672. He participated in the Battle of Khotyn in 1673.http://www.wilanow- palac.art.pl/potocki_andrzej_h_pilawa_zm_1691.html Potocki later was one of the electors of John III Sobieski, representing the Kiev province in 1674, although he opposed the pro-French and anti-Brandenburgian policies of the king. In 1675 he was responsible for defeating the Tatars at the battle of Ka≈Çusz. In 1680 Potocki was appointed the governor of Krak√≥w and subsequently the Krak√≥w castellan in 1682. In 1683 during an expedition to Vienna, Potocki was nominated as the chief ruler of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, while Sobieski was absent. Potocki successfully conducted warfare in the south- eastern parts of the country, known as Podolia, and regained large parts of the land (including Niemir√≥w) from the Turks. For this, in 1684, he was appointed the Field Crown Hetman. He later took part in the unsuccessful expeditions against Moldavia in 1685. He was also starost of Halicz, Wyszogr√≥d, Le≈ºajsk, ≈öniaty≈Ñ, Ko≈Çomyja, Mo≈õcisk and Medyka. After his death in 1691, Potocki was buried in the city of Stanis≈Çaw√≥w (named after his father), where he founded a new catholic collegiate church. His remains were desecrated and thrown out of the tomb, during the planned destruction of the church by Ukrainian communists after 1963.

It is one of the best decorated tombs in the valley, but now is almost always closed to the public due to damage. As per November 2017 holders of a 1200 EGP entry ticket or of a Luxor Pass can visit this tomb. It was first discovered by Giovanni Battista Belzoni on 16 October 1817. When he first entered the tomb he found the wall paintings in excellent condition with the paint on the walls still looking fresh and some of the artists paints and brushes still on the floor. The longest tomb in the valley, at 137.19 meters (450.10 feet), it contains very well preserved reliefs in all but two of its eleven chambers and side rooms. One of the back chambers is decorated with the Ritual of the Opening of the mouth, which stated that the mummy's eating and drinking organs were properly functioning. Believing in the need for these functions in the afterlife, this was a very important ritual. A very long tunnel (corridor K) leads away deep into the mountainside from beneath the location where the sarcophagus stood in the burial chamber. Recently, the excavation of this corridor was completed. It turned out that there was no 'secret burial chamber' or any other kind of chamber at the end. Work on the corridor was just abandoned upon the burial of Seti. The sarcophagus removed on behalf of the British consul Henry Salt is since 1824 in the Sir John Soane's Museum in London. KV17 was damaged when Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, translator of the Rosetta Stone, removed a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05 m (7.41 x 3.44 ft) in a corridor with mirror-image scenes during his 1828-29 expedition. Other elements were removed by his companion Rossellini or the German expedition of 1845. The scenes are now in the collections of the Louvre, the museums of Florence and Berlin. The tomb became known as the \\"Apis tomb\\" because when Giovanni Belzoni found the tomb a mummified bull was found in a side room off the burial hall. A number of walls in the tomb have collapsed or cracked due to excavations in the late 1950s and early 1960s causing significant changes in the moisture levels in the surrounding rocks. Facsimiles of two rooms from the tomb, the Hall of Beauties and Pillared Hall J, have been made by Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation.

It is structurally related to the parent bicyclic heterocycle called pteridine. Pterins, as a group, are compounds related to pterin with additional substituents. Pterin itself is of no biological significance. Pterins were first discovered in the pigments of butterfly wings (hence the origin of their name, from the Greek pteron (œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ), wing) and perform many roles in coloration in the biological world. Pterin cofactors One important family of pterin derivatives are Folates. Folates are pterins that contain p-aminobenzoic acid connected to the methyl group at position 6 of the pteridine ring system (known as pteroic acid) conjugated with one or more L-glutamates. They participate in numerous biological group transfer reactions. Folate-dependent biosynthetic reactions include the transfer of methyl groups from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine to form L-methionine, and the transfer of formyl groups from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to L-methionine to form N-formylmethionine in initiator tRNAs. Folates are also essential for the biosynthesis of purines and one pyrimidine. =Biosynthetic precursor= Substituted pteridines are intermediates in the biosynthesis of dihydrofolic acid in many microorganisms.Voet, D.; Voet, J.G. (2004). Biochemistry (3rd ed.). John Wiley & Sons. The enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase converts pteridine and 4-aminobenzoic acid to dihydrofolic acid in the presence of glutamate. The enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase is inhibited by sulfonamide antibiotics. Molybdopterin is a cofactor found in virtually all molybdenum and tungsten-containing proteins. Moco biosynthetic pathway in bacteria and humans. Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis occurs in four steps: (i) the radical-mediated cyclization of nucleotide, guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP), to (8S)‚Äë3 ÃÅ,8‚Äêcyclo‚Äë7,8‚Äëdihydroguanosine 5 ÃÅ‚Äëtriphosphate (3 ÃÅ,8‚ÄëcH2GTP), (ii) the formation of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) from the 3 ÃÅ,8‚ÄëcH2GTP, (iii) the conversion of cPMP into molybdopterin (MPT), (iv) the insertion of molybdate into MPT to form Moco. The human enzymes are indicated in parenthesis. =Tetrahydrobiopterin= Tetrahydrobiopterin, the major unconjugated pterin in vertebrates, is involved in three families of enzymes that effect hydroxylation. The aromatic amino acid hydroxylases include phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylases. They are involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters catecholamine and serotonin. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also required for the functioning of alkylglycerol monooxygenase, whereby monoalkylglycerols are broken down to glycerol and an aldehyde. In the synthesis of nitric oxide the pterin-dependent nitric oxide synthase converts arginine to N-hydroxy derivative, which in turn releases NO. Biosynthesis The biosynthesis of pterins begins with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is the substrate for GTP cyclohydrolase I. The enzyme is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. step in biosynthesis of dihydroneopterin from GTP. Molybdopterin biosynthesis occurs in four steps: (i) the radical-mediated cyclization of nucleotide, guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP), to (8S)‚Äë3 ÃÅ,8‚Äêcyclo‚Äë7,8‚Äëdihydroguanosine 5 ÃÅ‚Äëtriphosphate (3 ÃÅ,8‚ÄëcH2GTP), (ii) the formation of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) from the 3 ÃÅ,8‚ÄëcH2GTP, (iii) the conversion of cPMP into molybdopterin (MPT), (iv) the insertion of molybdate into MPT to form Moco. The human enzymes are indicated in parenthesis. Moco biosynthetic pathway in bacteria and humans. Other pterins Pterin can exist in many different forms in nature depending on its function. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the major unconjugated pteridine in vertebrates, is a co-factor in the hydroxylation of aromatic compounds and synthesis of nitric oxide. Molybdopterin is a substituted pteridine that binds molybdenum to yield redox cofactors involved in biological hydroxylations, reduction of nitrate, and respiratory oxidation.

The company's Fort Myers Line, which was previously the southernmost segment of CSX's former Fort Myers Subdivision, runs from Arcadia south to North Naples via Punta Gorda, Fort Myers, Estero, and Bonita Springs. They also operate another former CSX line that runs from Oneco south through Sarasota. Seminole Gulf acquired the lines in November 1987 and operates its own equipment. The Seminole Gulf Railway has a commonly owned affiliated company, the Bay Colony Railroad Corp. , which is based in southeastern Massachusetts. Current operations Seminole Gulf Railway is one of two freight railroad operating in Southwest Florida (the other is South Central Florida Express, who operates tracks farther inland near Clewiston). Freight transported by Seminole Gulf Railway includes lumber, propane, stone, steel, scrap metal, and other commodities. Freight is interchanged with CSX usually once or twice a week on each line. On the Fort Myers Line, freight trains between the yard in Fort Myers and Arcadia are known as the Desoto Turn. The Desoto Turn switches customers between North Fort Myers and Arcadia while industries in Fort Myers and south of there are switched locally from the yard. =Murder Mystery Dinner Train & Excursions= SGLR 502 pulls the Murder Mystery Dinner Train near John Yarbrough Linear Park Trail. In addition to carrying freight, Seminole Gulf Railway also operates a popular Murder Mystery Dinner Train from Fort Myers. The dinner train runs five nights a week, year-round from a station at Colonial Boulevard north to a point just south of Punta Gorda before returning. The dinner train utilizes a fleet of 1930s-era vintage rail cars named after nearby barrier islands (some of which were previously Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus rail cars). The dinner train includes a five-course dinner and has featured over 80 different murder mystery productions throughout its history. Special holiday dinner trains also operate including Sweetheart Express on Valentine's Day, Halloween Ghost Train, New Year's Eve Gala, and Christmas Rail-Boat (which runs to the historic Punta Gorda Atlantic Coast Line Depot for a Christmas boat tour through Punta Gorda Isles) to name a few. Seminole Gulf has also operated general excursion trains in the past. Seminole Gulf introduced passenger excursion trains in 1991 after losing a major freight customer. Excursion trains and were initially based from a small platform in North Naples near Railhead Park, but moved to the current station at Colonial Boulevard in Fort Myers shortly after. The dinner and excursion trains are often pulled by one of two vintage EMD F-unit locomotives, SGLR 501 and SGLR 502. SGLR 501, an F9AM, was previously operated by the Milwaukee Road, while SGLR 502, an F7, was previously operated on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Both were later acquired by the Long Island Rail Road, where they were converted into cab cars and used from the 1970s until 1999, before being sent to the SGLR. Fort Myers Line Desoto Turn crossing Caloosahatchee River Seminole Gulf's Fort Myers Line, which extends nearly 80 miles, begins in Arcadia and runs south to Punta Gorda, Fort Myers, Bonita Springs, and North Naples. The Fort Myers Line begins just north of Arcadia, where it continues south from CSX's Brewster Subdivision (at milepost SVC 880.75). From this point, it briefly runs along the former Charlotte Harbor and Northern/Seaboard Air Line Railroad across the Peace River, passing Morgan Park, and into the Arcadia yard. CSX has trackage rights into Arcadia yard to facilitate the interchange between the two companies.CSX Jacksonville Division Timetable From the yard, the main line continues from a wye southeast a short distance toward Downtown Arcadia before turning south on to the former Florida Southern/Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. It runs south-southwest from Arcadia roughly paralleling the Peace River through Fort Ogden and Cleveland to Punta Gorda. In Punta Gorda, it turns south and then southeast closely paralleling Interstate 75 towards North Fort Myers before crossing the Caloosahatchee River between there and Tice. The crossing over the Caloosahatchee River includes a drawbridge and series of trestles that traverse Beautiful Island. From Tice on the south side of the river, the line heads southwest towards Downtown Fort Myers. Just east of downtown, the line turns south again through an industrial area. Seminole Gulf's main switching yard in Fort Myers is located underneath the Metro Parkway overpass, and a maintenance yard is just south of Colonial Boulevard next to Page Field. The line continues south from Fort Myers along the Ten Mile Canal (the John Yarbrough Linear Park parallels the line along the canal). The line has a short spur just north San Carlos Park known as the Baker Spur, which extends west a little over a mile along Alico Road. From the Baker Spur junction, the main line then heads south through Estero and Downtown Bonita Springs before terminating near Wiggins Pass Road in North Naples, just a mile south of the Lee/Collier County line. Though, his segment of the main line is currently inactive and has not had any active shippers since around 2008. =History= What is now Seminole Gulf Railway's main line came into existence incrementally in the late 1800s and early 20th century. The northernmost section of the Seminole Gulf track along with the Arcadia yard and the CSX line to the north was originally built by the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway. Built from 1907 to 1910, the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway (which would later be acquired by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1926) historically extended from Arcadia south to Boca Grande. The line from the Arcadia yard southeast along Pine Street was the Charlotte Harbor and Northern's connecting track to the Florida Southern Railway. From this point south, Seminole Gulf continues south along the former Florida Southern Railway (a subsidiary of Henry Plant's system of railroads) south to Punta Gorda. This segment was built in 1886 making it the oldest segment of the Seminole Gulf line and was the southernmost segment of the Florida Southern's Charlotte Harbor Division, which originated in Bartow. The original Florida Southern route north of Arcadia (which ran past the historic Arcadia passenger depot) was removed in the mid 1980s. Surveying work to determine the route for the Florida Southern Railway to Punta Gorda was done by Punta Gorda civil engineer Albert W. Gilchrist, who would later serve as Florida's 20th governor. The line's first train to Punta Gorda arrived on July 24, 1886. The line, originally built as narrow gauge, was widened to standard gauge in 1892, and the Florida Southern was fully integrated with the Plant System in 1896. In Punta Gorda, the line initially continued west through the city and terminated at a dock facility in the Peace River near Charlotte Harbor. This dock, known as the Long Dock, was located near the Punta Gorda Isles Yacht Club (a mile west of where Fishermen's Village stands today). A passenger depot was also located near King Street (the historic depot on Taylor Street was built later in 1928). Punta Gorda became the southernmost point the Plant System ever reached, and the railroad's arrival is largely responsible for Punta Gorda's development as a city, which was incorporated four years later. Today, the spur near Elizabeth Street in Punta Gorda is all that remains of the original alignment to the Punta Gorda docks (the Punta Gorda Linear Park today runs along the rest of that route west of US 41). Seminole Gulf's drawbridge over the Caloosahatchee River just east of Fort Myers at milepost AX 960. Charlotte Harbor was Henry Plant's ultimate goal and he had no interest in having the line continue south to Fort Myers. This is despite the fact that Plant opened a hotel in Fort Myers in 1896. Fort Myers sought railroad service and had already been established as a city when the Florida Southern was complete unlike Punta Gorda. After Plant's death in 1899, his heirs would sell his entire system of railroads to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902, and serving Fort Myers quickly became a top priority for Atlantic Coast Line president Henry Walters. The extension of the line to Fort Myers via Tice was completed on May 10, 1904, making it the Coast Line's first expansion of the former Plant System. The alignment through Tice was selected so the line would cross the wide Caloosahatchee River farther upstream at Beautiful Island, where less extensive bridge work was needed. The extension included a depot at Main and Monroe Streets and a wharf along the Caloosahatchee River at the end of Monroe Street in downtown Fort Myers. The original depot would be replaced with the depot that still stands today on Peck Street (now Widman Way) in 1924, and the wharf would only exist until 1944. The spur that runs from the line just south of State Road 82 is all that remains of the wye and tracks that once served the downtown Fort Myers depot and docks. Fort Myers also experienced major growth after the arrival of the railroad and would remain the southernmost point of the entire Atlantic Coast Line Railroad system until the Florida land boom of the 1920s. Once the land boom was underway, the Coast Line partnered with a number of local businessmen including advertising entrepreneur Barron Collier, who owned large amounts of land in the newly-created Collier County. Through this partnership, they acquired the dormant charter of the unbuilt Fort Myers Southern Railroad, and the line was extended further south towards Collier County. It reached Bonita Springs by late 1925 where a depot was built just south of the Imperial River (the depot has since been demolished but the depot's platform and siding still remain near Riverside Park). The line was further extended to Naples by December 1926, and to Collier City on Marco Island in mid 1927. At the same time, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (via their Seaboard-All Florida Railway subsidiary) built a competing line from Fort Ogden to Fort Myers and Naples. Seaboard's service to Naples commenced eleven days after the Coast Line. Seaboard discontinued service to Naples in 1942 and the Atlantic Coast Line rerouted their line from Vanderbilt Beach to the Seaboard's former passenger depot on Fifth Avenue South. The Atlantic Coast Line became the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1967. The Baker Spur just north of San Carlos Park was then built in 1973. The Baker Spur would extend beyond the route of Interstate 75 to serve rock mines in eastern Lee County on land owned by the Atlantic Land and Improvement Company (known today as Alico, Inc.), which at one point had been a subsidiary of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and was the holding company for its real estate division. Seminole Gulf abandoned the easternmost three miles of the Baker Spur in 1994. Intercity passenger service to Southwest Florida was discontinued in 1971 upon the creation of Amtrak, who opted not to serve Southwest Florida. In 1979, tracks into downtown Naples were removed when the line was cut back to its current terminus in North Naples, a year before Seaboard Coast Line would become CSX (nine years before Seminole Gulf would begin operating it).

The northwest end of the line is located just south of Bradenton in Oneco, where it continues south from CSX's Palmetto Subdivision. The interchange point is located a little over a mile south of CSX's Tropicana Yard, where a side track facilitates the interchange between the two companies. From Oneco, the line heads due south along former Seaboard Air Line Railroad tracks towards Sarasota, passing through Tallevast and close to Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport. The line's locomotives are stored on a spur into Suburban Propane on Whitfield Avenue in Tallevast. Just north of Downtown Sarasota, the line turns east onto former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad tracks and comes to a wye just east of US 301. From the wye, the line turns back north along the former Atlantic Coast Line main line and terminates just south of Whitfield Avenue in Motoaka. The line went as far south as Venice when Seminole Gulf first began operating it. Track to Venice previously ran from the wye at the southeast corner of the current line and went south-southeast through Fruitville, Bee Ridge, Palmer Ranch and Nokomis. Track was abandoned south of Palmer Ranch in 2004 and the remaining line up to Fruitville Road was abandoned in 2019. Sarasota County built the popular Legacy Trail on the former right of way and is in the process of extending it north to Fruitville Road on the remaining right of way. =History= The first trackage of the Sarasota line to be built (the west track) was built by the Seaboard Air Line (through their Florida West Shore Railway subsidiary) in 1903. It was part of a line that extended from Durant (just east of Tampa), to Sarasota via Parrish, Palmetto and Bradenton. Some of the line was built on the former road bed of the Arcadia, Gulf Coast and Lakeland Railroad, an earlier unsuccessful railroad between Bradenton and Sarasota. In Sarasota, the tracks originally continued south into downtown along Lemon Avenue and served a dock facility in Sarasota Bay. In 1905, Seaboard extended the line east into Fruitville, which initially ran southeast along Pineapple Avenue and then east along what is now Alderman Street and Brother Geenen Way. In 1911, at the request of local socialite Bertha Honor√© Palmer, the line was extended south to Venice. The Atlantic Coast Line came to the area later in 1924 as part of the Florida land boom when they built the Tampa Southern Railroad (the east track). A passenger depot existed at Main Street and School Avenue and a spur was built to Payne Terminal at Hog Creek (this spur and its wye today form the connection track between the east and west track). From Sarasota, the Coast Line track turned east and ran directly beside the Seaboard track through Fruitville. From 1924 to 1949 the Coast Line track continued from Fruitville southeast as far as Fort Ogden (along the Peace River), where it merged with the Coast Line's route to Fort Myers (which is today, coincidentally, Seminole Gulf's Fort Myers Line). Spurs connected both lines to the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus's Sarasota headquarters near Fruitville (which existed from 1927 to 1959, when the headquarters were relocated to the end of the line in Venice). In 1967, the Seaboard Air Line and the Atlantic Coast Line merged to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (who later merged with the Chessie System in the 1980s to form CSX). The mergers brought the all of the track under a single owner and led to consolidation of the two routes and abandonment of redundant trackage. This included the Seaboard's original route through downtown Sarasota, the Coast Line's tracks between Bradenton and Matoaka, and the consolidation of the east-west parallel track through Fruitville to a single track (using the former Seaboard track). After taking over the line in 1987, Seminole Gulf continued to carry the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus to their Venice headquarters up until 1990. The circus then relocated to Tampa mainly due to the fact that the Venice segment could no longer support their rail equipment due to the rough condition of the track. As previously mentioned, the line was abandoned from Venice to Palmer Ranch in 2004 due to decreased demand and the heavily deteriorated condition of the tracks and bridges. The rest of the line up to Sarasota abandoned in 2019.

It originally opened in 2002, producing the Volkswagen Phaeton until 2016. As of 2017 it produces the electric version of the Golf. Meaning The original German name is Gl√§serne Manufaktur (meaning factory made of glass). Both the German and English names are a word play on the double meaning of transparent and glassy, referring to both optical transparency and transparency of the production process. It is .93 miles (1.5 kilometres) long. Car factory The factory originally assembled Volkswagen's luxury sedan, the Phaeton. It used 60,000 magnets in its fully automated assembly line. Spare capacity was also used to build Bentley Continental Flying Spur vehicles destined for the European market until 2006, when all work was transferred to Bentley's plant in Crewe, England. Production of the Bentley Flying Spur resumed in late 2013. The factory only handled final assembly. Operations such as stamping and welding and the painting of the steel bodies took place in Zwickau. Painted bodies arrived at the factory by truck. The other 1200 parts and 34 preassembled components were shipped to a logistics center and are transported to the factory by CarGoTrams that run on Dresden's public transport tracks. All vehicle production at the factory ended in March 2016, before restarting again in 2017. The Volkswagen ID.3 is to be produced here from late 2020. Location The Transparent Factory is situated in the city center of Dresden, an 800-year-old baroque city known for its arts and craftsmanship. It stands in a corner of the Gro√üer Garten, where a convention center was located before the second world war. The factory's walls are made almost completely of glass. Its floors are covered entirely in Canadian maple. Its visitor-friendly layout was designed to accommodate up to 250 tourists per day. There are no smokestacks, no loud noises, and no toxic byproducts. Volkswagen planted 350 trees in the grounds. Current visitor experience Visitors can test drive VW electric vehicles for 30 minutes, take a virtual tour of Dresden and look at various exhibits relating to VW's electric and hybrid technologies. Previous visitor experience The Gl√§serne Manufaktur also provided visitors with a series of educational attractions relating to the VW \\"Phaeton\\". The attractions, designed by BRC Imagination Arts, include Vision World, a multimedia \\"global theater\\" that allows visitors to take the pulse of the planet in real time; a Virtual Test drive, featuring a real VW Phaeton combined with motion base technology and computer generated scenery; a computer-based Car Configurator that enables visitors to design the VW Phaeton of their dreams; an interactive Techwall explaining the workings of the Phaeton's \\"infotainment\\" system; a Virtual Production Tour; and a media- enhanced Delivery Experience for customers taking possession of new vehicles. The German TV channel ZDF occasionally films a philosophical panel discussion in the Transparent Factory, \\"Das philosophische Quartett\\" (The Philosophical Quartet). To stop birds from flying into the glass, an outdoor speaker system emulates bird language marking the territory as \\"taken\\". Future The factory is to be renovated to enable it to produce luxury and electric cars.

It was during the Rococo period that the chaise longue became the symbol of social status and only the rarest and most expensive materials were used in their construction. Today, the chaise longue is seen as a luxury item for the modern home. They are often used to complement a home's d√©cor such as living or reading rooms, or as a stylish boudoir chair for bedroom seating. * Duchesse bris√©e (Broken duchess in French): this word is used when the chaise longue is divided in two parts: the chair and a long footstool, or two chairs with a stool in between them. The origin of the name is unknown. * R√©camier: a r√©camier has two raised ends, and nothing on the long sides. It is sometimes associated with French Empire (neo-classical) style. It is named after French society hostess Madame R√©camier (1777‚Äì1849), who posed elegantly on a couch of this kind for a portrait, painted in 1800 by Jacques-Louis David. The shape of the r√©camier is similar to a traditional lit bateau (boat bed) but made for the drawing room, not the bedroom. * M√©ridienne: a m√©ridienne has a high head-rest, and a lower foot-rest, joined by a sloping piece. Whether or not they have anything at the foot end, m√©ridiennes are asymmetrical day-beds. They were popular in the grand houses of France in the early 19th century. Its name is from its typical use: rest in the middle of the day, when the sun is near the meridian.

Sigmund Freud initiated the use of the chaise longue for this purpose, with the idea being that the patient would recline on a couch, with the analyst seated beyond the head of the couch, so that the client would not see the analyst. Reclining and not having to face the analyst was thought to be disinhibiting and to encourage free association. At the time Freud began to use the chaise longue, it was considered daring in Vienna to recline on a chaise in the presence of non- intimates. Freud's own chaise longue, given to him by a patient, may be seen today at the Freud Museum in London. Today, psychoanalysts continue to invite clients to recline on couches in their offices during psychotherapy, and may use chaises longues rather than more conventional styles of couch out of tradition. The chaise longue is used to suggest a generic psychotherapist's office in cartoons and other works.

It was inaugurated in 1932.http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0010728 From 1932 to 1934 this transmitter (which replaced the Stadelheim Transmitter at Munich- Stadelheim) used a T-antenna as transmitting antenna, which was spun between two 115-metre-high free-standing wooden lattice towers, which were 240 metres apart. As this antenna had an unfavourable vertical radiation pattern, which produced much skywave resulting in a too small fading-free reception area at night, in 1934 a new antenna was installed. Therefore, one of the towers was dismantled and rebuilt on a wooden lattice base. While this work took place, an L-Antenna was used, which was spun between the other tower and a small auxiliary wooden tower. It became defunct in 1977 and was destroyed in 1983. Wooden broadcasting tower After completion of the new wood tower, which was 156 metres high without the arms carrying the antenna (with these arms its height amounted to 163 metres),http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?buildingID=41612 the second wood tower was dismantled and rebuilt in 1935 at Nuremberg-Kleinreuth, where it served until 1961 as a transmission tower for medium wave. The wood tower at Ismaning carried a dipole antenna, whose point of feeding was at 120 metres height. From this point of feeding, several wires ran to the arms on the tower top and to fastening spots at a height of 80 metres. At this height a differential transformer was installed in a small housing inside the tower; its task was to prevent the drain of the radiated high frequency over the feeder. This antenna, developed by the company Lorenz, was called \\"H√∂hendipol\\". It was one for the transmitter frequency of 740 kHz, which was used from 1934 to 1950, optimized fading-reducing transmitting antenna. However, according to the wave plan of Copenhagen, which required directional radiation at night times, it could only be used during daylight hours after 1950. In 1969 this antenna was dismantled after a new medium wave transmitting mast was built. Between 1969 and 1977 the wood tower was used for carrying transmitting antennas for FM broadcasting. In 1977 a 100-metre-high guyed steel framework mast took over this function, so the wood tower became defunct in 1977. The state of the tower worsened more and more after 1977, and it seemed to be impossible to repair this tower, which was nicknamed \\"Bavarian Eiffel Tower,\\" and which was already under protection as a monument. On March 16, 1983 it was blown up. Its concrete foundations and the tuning house, which once stood under the tower, can still be seen today. Services transmitted =Bavarian Broadcasting Company= The transmission facility Ismaning is used for transmitting the first program of the Bavarian Broadcasting Company on the medium wave frequency 801 kHz (transmission power 600 kilowatts until 1994, now 100 kilowatts) and for all programmes of the Bavarian Broadcasting company in the FM range. Until 1994 there was also a transmitter of the American Forces Network (AFN), with its AFN Munich station, at Ismaning.http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?buildingID=45804http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0010733 For the AM transmissions a 171.5-metre- highhttp://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?buildingID=45270 guyed steel tube masthttp://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0010731 is used. This mast is insulated from the ground and is designed as a fading reducing transmission aerial with multiple feeding. Therefore, it is separated at 56 metre and 117 metre heights by insulators. Restrictions of the waveplan of Geneva required a minimum of radiation in direction Northeast, in order to reduce interferences of the transmitter Saint Petersburg, Russia, on the same frequency, if transmission power is 600 kilowatts at night. Therefore, in 1978http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0010735 a 71-metre- highhttp://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?buildingID=60454 guyed steel-framework mast, which is insulated against ground, was built near the mast upper mentioned. Because a power reduction toward Northeast is not necessary with a transmission power of 100 kilowatts, this mast is now obsolete, but it is still there. As back-up aerial a 105-metre-high, guyed steel framework mast was built in 1947 close to the transmitter building. This mast, which was originally used for transmitting the program of AFN was until 1969 126 metre high and carried from 1958 to 1969 aerials for FM transmissions. Restriction by the waveplan of Copenhagen had the result, that the mediumwave transmitter of the Bavarian Broadcasting Company had to work with directional radiation with minimum toward Northeast after 1951 at nighttime. This type of radiation was not possible with the aerial on the wood framework tower and a directional aerial consisting of two insulated guyed radio masts with a height of 94 metres had to be built.http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?buildingID=45802http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?buildingID=45803http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0010736 This aerial was until 1969 for transmitting the program of the Bavarian broadcasting company during nighttime in service. After 1969 it was used until its shutdown in 1994 for transmitting the program of AFN on 1107 kHz. In difference to the time before 1969 omnidirectional radiation was used. One mast was used and the other one was a spare unit. As aerials for shortwave transmissions of the Bavarian broadcasting company there are a dipole aerial, built in 1976, which hangs on two guyed steelframework masts with a height of 35 metres and a winkle dipole which hangs on three guyed steel framework masts with a height of 55 metres. The winkle dipole aerial went in service in 1980. For FM broadcasting transmission, there is a silvery grey guyed steel framework mast with dipol arrays on its top near the station building. This mast, which was built in 1977, has a height of 100 metres and is the only mast at the transmitter Ismaning, which is grounded.http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?buildingID=45805http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0010732 =Voice of America= The Voice of America ran until 1994 near the station of the Bavarian Broadcasting company a large shortwave transmission facility, which has nowadays has been scrapped The medium wave transmission facility of the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty operated by the International Broadcasting Bureau was shut down in March 2005.

Cyclodextrins are a family of cyclic oligosaccharides, consisting of a macrocyclic ring of glucose subunits joined by Œ±-1,4 glycosidic bonds. Cyclodextrins are produced from starch by enzymatic conversion. They are used in food, pharmaceutical, drug delivery, and chemical industries, as well as agriculture and environmental engineering. Cyclodextrins are composed of 5 or more Œ±-D- glucopyranoside units linked 1->4, as in amylose (a fragment of starch). The largest cyclodextrin contains 32 1,4-anhydroglucopyranoside units, while as a poorly characterized mixture, at least 150-membered cyclic oligosaccharides are also known. Typical cyclodextrins contain a number of glucose monomers ranging from six to eight units in a ring, creating a cone shape: * Œ± (alpha)-cyclodextrin: 6 glucose subunits * Œ≤ (beta)-cyclodextrin: 7 glucose subunits * Œ≥ (gamma)-cyclodextrin: 8 glucose subunits Applications =Drug delivery= With a hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior, cyclodextrins form complexes with hydrophobic compounds. Alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrin are all generally recognized as safe by the U.S. FDA.GRAS Notice No. GRN 000155, alpha-cyclodextrin;GRAS Notice No. GRN 000074, beta- cyclodextrin;GRAS Notice No. GRN 000046, gamma-cyclodextrin They have been applied for delivery of a variety of drugs, including hydrocortisone, prostaglandin, nitroglycerin, itraconazol, chloramphenicol. The cyclodextrin confers solubility and stability to these drugs. The inclusion compounds of cyclodextrins with hydrophobic molecules are able to penetrate body tissues, these can be used to release biologically active compounds under specific conditions. In most cases the mechanism of controlled degradation of such complexes is based on pH change of water solutions, leading to the loss of hydrogen or ionic bonds between the host and the guest molecules. Alternative means for the disruption of the complexes take advantage of heating or action of enzymes able to cleave Œ±-1,4 linkages between glucose monomers. Cyclodextrins were also shown to enhance mucosal penetration of drugs. =Chromatography= Œ≤-cyclodextrins are used to produce stationary phase media for HPLC separations. =Other= Cyclodextrins bind fragrances. Such devices are capable of releasing fragrances during ironing or when heated by human body. Such a device commonly used is a typical 'dryer sheet'. The heat from a clothes dryer releases the fragrance into the clothing. They are the main ingredient in Febreze which claims that the Œ≤-cyclodextrins \\"trap\\" odor causing compounds, thereby reducing the odor. Cyclodextrins are also used to produce alcohol powder by encapsulating ethanol. The powder produces an alcoholic beverage when mixed with water. Structure Œ≥-CD toroid structure showing spatial arrangement. Typical cyclodextrins are constituted by 6-8 glucopyranoside units. These subunits are linked by 1,4 glycosidic bonds. The cyclodextrins have toroidal shapes, with the larger and the smaller openings of the toroid exposing to the solvent secondary and primary hydroxyl groups respectively. Because of this arrangement, the interior of the toroids is not hydrophobic, but considerably less hydrophilic than the aqueous environment and thus able to host other hydrophobic molecules. In contrast, the exterior is sufficiently hydrophilic to impart cyclodextrins (or their complexes) water solubility. They are not soluble in typical organic solvents. Synthesis Cyclodextrins are prepared by enzymatic treatment of starch. Commonly cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) is employed along with Œ±-amylase. First starch is liquified either by heat treatment or using Œ±-amylase, then CGTase is added for the enzymatic conversion. CGTases produce mixtures of cyclodextrins, thus the product of the conversion results in a mixture of the three main types of cyclic molecules, in ratios that are strictly dependent on the enzyme used: each CGTase has its own characteristic Œ±:Œ≤:Œ≥ synthesis ratio. Purification of the three types of cyclodextrins takes advantage of the different water solubility of the molecules: Œ≤-CD which is poorly water- soluble (18.5 g/l or 16.3mM) (at 25C) can be easily retrieved through crystallization while the more soluble Œ±- and Œ≥-CDs (145 and 232 g/l respectively) are usually purified by means of expensive and time consuming chromatography techniques. As an alternative a \\"complexing agent\\" can be added during the enzymatic conversion step: such agents (usually organic solvents like toluene, acetone or ethanol) form a complex with the desired cyclodextrin which subsequently precipitates. The complex formation drives the conversion of starch towards the synthesis of the precipitated cyclodextrin, thus enriching its content in the final mixture of products. Wacker Chemie AG uses dedicated enzymes, that can produce alpha-, beta- or gamma-cyclodextrin specifically. This is very valuable especially for the food industry, as only alpha- and gamma-cyclodextrin can be consumed without a daily intake limit. Crystal structure of a rotaxane with an Œ±-cyclodextrin macrocycle. =Derivatives= Interest in cyclodextrins is enhanced because their host‚Äìguest behavior can be manipulated by chemical modification of the hydroxyl groups. O-Methylation and acetylation are typical conversions. Propylene oxide gives hydroxypropylated derivatives. The primary alcohols can be tosylated. The degree of derivatization is an adjustable, i.e. full methylation vs partial. Both Œ≤-cyclodextrin and methyl-Œ≤-cyclodextrin (MŒ≤CD) remove cholesterol from cultured cells. The methylated form MŒ≤CD was found to be more efficient than Œ≤-cyclodextrin. The water-soluble MŒ≤CD is known to form soluble inclusion complexes with cholesterol, thereby enhancing its solubility in aqueous solution. MŒ≤CD is employed for the preparation of cholesterol-free products: the bulky and hydrophobic cholesterol molecule is easily lodged inside cyclodextrin rings. MŒ≤CD is also employed in research to disrupt lipid rafts by removing cholesterol from membranes. Research In supramolecular chemistry, cyclodextrins are precursors to mechanically interlocked molecular architectures, such as rotaxanes and catenanes. Illustrative, Œ±-cyclodextrin form second-sphere coordination complex with tetrabromoaurate anion ([AuBr4]-). Beta-cyclodextrin complexes with certain carotenoid food colorants have been shown to intensify color, increase water solubility and improve light stability. History Space filling model of Œ≤-cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins, as they are known today, were called \\"cellulosine\\" when first described by A. Villiers in 1891. Soon after, F. Schardinger identified the three naturally occurring cyclodextrins -Œ±, -Œ≤, and -Œ≥. These compounds were therefore referred to as \\"Schardinger sugars\\". For 25 years, between 1911 and 1935, Pringsheim in Germany was the leading researcher in this area, demonstrating that cyclodextrins formed stable aqueous complexes with many other chemicals. By the mid-1970s, each of the natural cyclodextrins had been structurally and chemically characterized and many more complexes had been studied. Since the 1970s, extensive work has been conducted by Szejtli and others exploring encapsulation by cyclodextrins and their derivatives for industrial and pharmacologic applications.Szejtli J. (1988). \\"Cyclodextrin Technology\\" vol 1. Springer, New York\\" Among the processes used for complexation, the kneading process seems to be one of the best. Safety Cyclodextrins are of wide interest in part because they are nontoxic. The LD50 (oral, rats) is on the order of grams per kilogram.

The Declaration of Sports (also known as the Book of Sports) was a declaration of James I of England issued just for Lancashire in 1617, nationally in 1618, and reissued by Charles I in 1633. It listed the sports and recreations that were permitted on Sundays and other holy days. Issue under James I It was originally issued in consultation with Thomas Morton, bishop of Chester, to resolve a dispute in Lancashire between the Puritans and the gentry (many of whom were Roman Catholics). The initial declaration was just for Lancashire, but in 1618, James made the declaration national. The 1618 declaration has largely the same main text as the 1617 version, but with an additional paragraph at the beginning explaining that the king has decided to make the declaration applicable to the whole of England. The declaration listed archery, dancing, \\"leaping, vaulting, or any other such harmless recreation\\" as permissible sports, together with \\"May-games, Whitsun-ales and Morris- dances, and the setting up of May-poles\\". Also allowed: \\"women shall have leave to carry rushes to the church for the decorating of it, according to their old custom.\\" Amongst the activities that were prohibited were bear- and bull-baiting, \\"interludes\\" and bowling. On the one hand, the declaration rebuked Puritans and other \\"precise persons\\", and was issued to counteract the growing Puritan calls for strict abstinence on the Christian Sabbath (Sabbatarianism). On the other, it condemned Catholics and others who did not attend church services in their parish, as the declaration specified that only people who had first attended divine service were entitled to participate in recreations afterward. Re-issue under Charles I The declaration was reissued by Charles I on 18 October 1633, as The King's Majesty's declaration to his subjects concerning lawful sports to be used. It was claimed by William Prynne that the new declaration was written by Charles' new Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, but Laud denied this and there is only evidence that he supported and facilitated the reissue.Craigie, Minor Prose Works of James VI and James I, pp. 227‚Äì28. Moreover, the 1633 declaration has the same main text as the 1617 and 1618 declarations of King James, with the primary differences an additional introduction and conclusion adding wakes and ales (countryside festivals) to the list of sanctioned recreations. Charles ordered that any minister who refused to read it would be deprived of position. As the Puritans gained power in Parliament in the lead-up to the English Civil War, hostility to the Book of Sports grew. Attempts to enforce the declaration came to an end with the fall of Archbishop Laud in 1640, and Parliament ordered the book publicly burned in 1643, two years before Laud was executed.

The film stars Carmelo G√≥mez, Emma Su√°rez, Ana Torrent, and Karra Elejalde. An eerie family saga set in rural Basque Country, the cryptic film follows the intertwined story of three generations of two families from 1875 to 1936. It was M√©dem's first film and for it he won the 1993 Goya Award as Best New Director. Plot Fighting in the trenches of Biscay in 1875 during the Third Carlist War, Carmelo Mendiluze, an army sergeant, learns from a young errand boy named Ilegorri that Manuel Irigu√≠bel, his neighbor from his native village, has joined their exhausted battalion. Eager for news of his child's birth, Carmelo befriends the inexperienced soldier whose reputation as an expert aizcolari (competition log cutter) cannot conceal his apprehension and fear of armed combat. Panicking under fire, Manuel drops to the ground and smears himself with blood gushing hot from the neck of his mortally wounded neighbor, Mendiluze. When the battle is over, Manuel crawls out from a cartload of the dead, naked bodies as he is transported away from the front lines. Nobody has seen his escape, except a curious, solitary cow. Thirty years later, in 1905 in rural Guip√∫zcoa, a lingering animosity has continued between the Mendiluze and Irigu√≠bel families. Manuel, now an old man, is still regarded as a coward; he spends his time painting the family‚Äôs cows watched over by his three granddaughters, the offspring of his son Ignacio Irigu√≠bel and his wife Madalen. Ignacio and Carmelo's son, Juan Mendiluze, have maintained family traditions by honing their skills as aizcolari. Despite the strained relations between the neighbors, the destinies of the two families are fatefully interconnected. Juan's sister, Catalina, cannot conceal her romantic interest for Ignacio as she furtively watches him practice cutting logs in the woods - an attraction that proves to be mutual through Ignacio's playful attempts to catch her already piqued attention. Paulina, the Mendiluze widow, warns her daughter that her interest for Ignacio Irigu√≠bel will bring the downfall of the Mendiluze family. In an attempt to capitalize from the rivalry between the two families, Ilegorri, now a grown man, arranges a waged competition between Ignacio and Juan. Ignacio wins and his career as an aizcolari contender is launched. Catalina and Ignacio start a secret affair. Ten years later, in the spring of 1915, Ignacio returns home after traveling to national competitions. He now enjoys fame and success. Although Ignacio takes care of his family farm, he neglects Madalen, his wife. He is promptly reunited with Catalina, and they have a ten-year-old son. After the death of their mother, the relationship between the bitter Juan and Catalina is increasingly strained. Juan, still a bachelor, is more obsessed and delusional in his incestuous feelings for his sister. Catalina, afraid of him, wants to escape to America with Ignacio. A close childhood friendship develops between Peru, Catalina and Ignacio's ten-year-old illegitimate son, and his half- sister Cristina; they wander amidst the mountain forest under the supervision of their limp and old grandfather, Manuel. Eventually the boy's parents elope to America and take him with them. In the summer of 1936, Peru has left his family behind, coming back to Guip√∫zcoa, as a photojournalist reporting on the Spanish Civil War. The Mendiluze farmhouse is empty. Juan, his uncle, has put on his Carlist red beret, joining the Nationalists. Peru is reunited with Cristina, his half-sister and childhood sweetheart. He stays at the Irigu√≠bel‚Äôs farm. Cristina has had a relationship with Lucas, Iligorri‚Äôs son. She shows Peru the last paintings made by their grandfather. The Spanish Civil War comes to the village. The men try to find refuge in the forest when the Nationalists come. Peru and Cristina follow them and are joined by Lucas, who offers to protect them. Lucas is killed and Peru is captured with the surviving men of the region. The men are executed but Peru is spared thanks to the intervention of Juan who recognizes him as his nephew. Reunited with Cristina, Peru and Cristina flee to the French frontier. Cast Director Julio M√©dem illustrates the cyclical nature of the unresolved strife and vacillating alliance between the two rival families in the film by using the same actor to portray generations of characters. The actor Carmelo G√≥mez's plays the cowardly Manuel Irigu√≠bel in the Carlist Wars, Manuel's son Ignacio in 1905, and eventually, the matured photographer, Peru Mendiluze, who returns the Basque region at the onset of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Kandido Uranga plays first the doomed Carmelo Mendiluze in 1875 and then Carmelo's obsessive and haunted son Juan in the other three segments of the film. Karra Elejade plays both Ilegorri and Ilegorri's son Lucas. M√©dem cast Carmelo G√≥mez in his next two films: La ardilla roja (The Red Squirrel), 1993) and Tierra (Earth), 1996) pairing him in both cases with Emma Su√°rez like here in Vacas. * Carmelo G√≥mez - Manuel/ Ignacio / Peru * Emma Su√°rez - Cristina * Ana Torrent - Catalina * Karra Elejalde - Ilegorri / Lucas * Txema Blasco - Manuel as an old man * Kandido Uranga - Carmelo / Juan * Klara Badiola - Madalen * Pilar Bardem - Paulina Overview Usually categorized as rural drama, the film narrates the lives of two Basque families covering the years 1875-1936, which historically were the unstable and bloody years from the Third Carlist War to the Spanish Civil War.Stone, Spanish Cinema, p. 161 To help the non- Spanish viewer understand the history depicted in the film: the Basques allied themselves initially with the Carlists (who were right-wing) but later with the Spanish Republic (who were left-wing) because, in each case, they were promised local autonomy. Small segments of Vacas were used by Medem in his documentary film La pelota vasca to illustrate the Carlist Wars. Reception Vacas was well received and proved an auspicious debut for Julio M√©dem, the director. Critics hailed M√©dem's craftsmanship and ability to marry the right images with his near mythic story lines. It was very successful and won the Goya Award of the Spanish academy for best new director and prizes in the festivals of Tokyo, Turin and Alexandria. Analysis The aesthetics of the movie established strongly M√©dem's so-called \\"dreamy style\\" (which ironically can be very nightmarish). His expressionist values would contrast rapidly with a time period in the Spanish cinema when the influences from the American movies would multiply (i.e. Alejandro Amen√°bar). The structure of Vacas is made up of concentric circles: European Style‚ÄîSpanish History‚ÄîBasque culture‚ÄîA village‚ÄîTwo houses of that village and, overseeing them all, the cows. The narrative is also very concentric; the film uses a continuous recycling recourse (i.e. the same actors play the three generations, which can be slightly confusing). M√©dem would also use a loop-like approach in his film Los amantes del c√≠rculo polar. M√©dem subverts the conventions of the family saga by replacing the human subjectivity of conventional melodrama and historical epics with a diffidence about life and death that is expressed through the uninterested gaze of the cows.Stone, Spanish Cinema, p. 162 The title of the film refers to the passive omnipresence of cows. The political and social climate of the Basque country of Spain is constantly in flux, yet the cows of the region are steadfast and calm, observing the unusual changing human culture without reaction. Instead of a society that is traditionally presented as oppressed and belittle by exterior forces, Vacas presents the Basque people as a race that, in petty rivalries, civil war and incest, has consumed itself from within. Most characters wish for nothing more than to escape the supposed idyll of the Basque Country, though those who do are fated to return and suffer the consequences of inescapable roots and blood ties.Stone, Spanish Cinema, p. 165 M√©dem further illustrates the cyclical nature of the unresolved strife and vacillating alliance by using the same actor to portray generations of characters. Instead of typifying the beauty of the land, the mist of the basque Valley create a malignant atmosphere that enshrouds the protagonists of Vacas, stimulating and manifesting their latent desires and urges.

Reynolds had previously arranged a meeting between Elizabeth Barton and Thomas More. It was his connection to Barton that particularly compromised Reynolds in the view of the Crown officers.

A witness claimed that Reynolds had stated that the \\"Dowager Princess\\" (Queen Catherine) was the true queen. Reynolds denied that he had declared an opinion against the king, except in confession, as compelled thereto. The practice of suborning penitents to accuse their confessors was in vogue at that time.

As with earlier actinocerids, Rayonnoceras has a canal system within the siphuncle that includes a narrow opening, the parispatium, between the internal deposits and inner wall of the connecting ring. It differs from the earlier actinocerids in having a bullet- like apex with a cicatrix and a long first chamber, characteristic of pseuorthocerids, rather than a blunt apex and short first chamber characteristic of true actinocerids. Orientation during life was horizontal. Cameral deposits, more concentrated in the apical part of the shell, are thought to have acted as ballast that compensated for the weight of the animal in the forward part. In life Rayonnoceras was probably a bottom dweller that spent most of its time stationary, waiting in ambush for prey. Rayonnoceras was among the last of the actinocerid-mimics, which finally died out in the Carboniferous. In 2003 a specimen of Rayonnoceras solidiforme eight feet long (2.4m) was found in Arkansas.

Some species are native to other areas such as the Caucasus. Growing from a bulb, species have linear basal leaves and a slender stalk, up to 30 cm tall, bearing clusters of typically white star-shaped flowers, often striped with green. The common name of the genus, Star-of-Bethlehem, is based on its star-shaped flowers, after the Star of Bethlehem that appeared in the biblical account of the birth of Jesus. The number of species has varied considerably, depending on authority, from 50 to 300.  Description  Ornithogalum species are perennial bulbous geophytes with basal leaves. Sensu lato, the genus has the characteristics of the tribe Ornithogaleae as a whole, since the tribe is monotypic in that sense. Sensu stricto, the genus is characterised by long linear to oblong-lanceolate (lance-shaped) leaves, sometimes with a white longitudinal band on the adaxial (upper) side, an inflorescence that is corymbose or pseudocorymbose, tepals that are white with a longitudinal green band only visible on the abaxial (lower) side, a capsule that is obovate or oblong, and truncate with six noticeable ribs in section and seeds that are globose with a prominently reticulate (net-like pattern) testa. The bulbs are ovoid with free or concrescent scales. The longitudinal band on the leaves is thought to be caused by an interruption of palisade tissue in the central portion of the leaf. This is an apomorphy that was not present in the early lineage of this clade, but is also seen in some Albuca species.  Taxonomy  Ornithogalum was originally described by Linnaeus in 1753, with 12 species, which he placed in the Hexandria Monogynia (six stamens, one carpel). When Michel Adanson formed the family Liliaceae in 1763, he placed Ornithogalum there, where it largely remained till this very large family was dismembered towards the end of the 20th century. Specifically, he included the genus with the onions (now Allioideae). By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. Baker placed Ornithogalum in the tribe Scilleae, one of eight tribes into which he divided the Liliaceae. He then further subdivided the genus into seven subgenera. Of those, the first, Heliocharmos, corresponds to the modern Ornithogalum sensu stricto, with 23 species. Later, in the United Kingdom, Bentham and Hooker published their volume on the Liliaceae in Latin in 1883. They divided the family into 20 tribes and placed Ornithogalum in the tribe Scilleae with 19 other genera, and indicated 70 species existed. In the German literature the taxonomic system of Engler completed its classification of the Liliaceae in 1888. He divided the family into 12 subfamilies and subordinate tribes. Ornithogalum was then placed in the subfamily Lilioideae and tribe Scilleae together with 21 other genera. The 70 species of Ornithogalum were then further divided into six sections, with section Heliocharmos corresponding to Baker's subgenus. Ornithogalum is one of four genera in the tribe Ornithogaleae, the largest tribe within the subfamily Scilloideae of the Asparagaceae. Historically, it was treated as part of the subfamily Ornithogaloideae of Hyacinthaceae, now obsolete terms. The preferred treatment is to consider the Hyacinthaceae as subfamily Scilloideae of the Asparagaceae. The original subfamilies within Hyacinthaceae became tribes of subfamily Scilloideae. Thus subfamily Ornithogaloideae became tribe Ornithogaleae. The precise taxonomy of the Ornithogaloideae/Ornithogaleae has been problematic since at least the time of Linnaeus. The Ornithogaloideae were one of four major clades within the Hyacinthaceae. Phylogenetic analysis subsumed all of that subfamily into the genus Ornithogalum with about 300 species. This sensu lato reduction of Speta's 14 genera into one was not widely accepted, though they were polyphyletic, and had a number of problems. (This also had the effect of eliminating Galtonia as a genus, under which a number of Ornithogalum species are still sold.) Further analysis with wider sampling (70 compared to 40 taxa) and a third plastid region (matK) revealed the presence of three clades (A, B and C) within Ornithogaleae/Ornithogalum. Consequently, a new classification was proposed with three tribes and four genera, Ornithogalum corresponding to clade C, placed in tribe Ornithogaleae, but further subdivided into subgenera and sections, with 160 species. Galtonia was retained as a taxon, but at the subgenus level. An alternative approach was suggested by combining plastid gene sequences with nuclear DNA sequences, morphology, and biogeography. This supported Manning's clade C within which Ornithogalum was contained, but the very large subgenus Ornithogalum was noted to still be heterogeneous, which they had managed by treating it as seven sections. This study suggested reversing the sensu lato (lumping) approach of Manning et al., reverting to separate genera (splitting), thus resurrecting Galtonia. The sensu stricto classification of Martinez-Azorin et al. reduces the number of species to 50 as originally proposed by Speta. Thus, any consideration of the genus needs to be examined as to whether it refers to sensu stricto, the 50 species considered by Speta (1988) and Martinez-Azorin et al. (2011), or sensu lato, the much larger genus envisaged by Manning et al. (2009). = Subdivision = This very large genus has long been divided into many subgenera. The Flora Europaea (1980) lists 15 subgenera, many of which had at various times been separate distinct genera. Having originally subsumed all of the Ornithogaleae genera into the single genus Ornithogalum, Manning et al. later subdivided this now very large genus into four subgenera after resurrecting three of the original subsumed genera (Albuca, Pseudogaltonia, Dipcadi). As proposed by them the genus has the following structure: *subgenus Avonsera (Speta) J.C. Manning & Goldblatt (monotypic: Ornithogalum convallarioides) *subgenus Galtonia (Decne.) J.C. Manning & Goldblatt (7 species) *subgenus Aspasia (Salisb.) Oberm.

(1988). Botanisches W√∂rterbuch (9th edition). Stuttgart: Gustav Fischer. The name is thought to be related to the white colour of the flowers; in some species, they resemble bird droppings. In ancient Greece, the name ornithogalon (·ΩÄœÅŒΩŒπŒ∏œåŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒøŒΩ) was first used to refer to Ornithogalum umbellatum.Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon.

The possible (non-attested) alternative form in ancient Greek, ornithogalƒì (·ΩÄœÅŒΩŒπŒ∏ŒøŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑) seems to be the source of classical Latin ornithogale as used by Pliny the Elder.Saalfeld, G.A.E.A.

Distribution and habitat  When the genus is broadly circumscribed, as for example by Plants of the World Online, species are widely distributed over several continents including Africa (other than the tropics), Madagascar, Europe, and temperate Asia (as far as Afghanistan). The genus sensu stricto encompasses only the species from Eurasia and North Africa.

Toxicity and use in alternative medicine  Some of the plants in the genus are poisonous, and have been known to kill grazing animals. Others are edible and used as vegetables. The bulbs contain alkaloidsPlants for a Future and cardenolides, which are toxic. Ornithogalum has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health.

Sekku is the term given meaning special day of observance. The festival is now celebrated on the seventh day of the first month and is considered a part of the New Year observances that are celebrated during this time. It is also known as Nanakusa-no-sekku, the \\"Feast of Seven Herbs\\", from the custom of eating seven-herb kayu ( ') to ensure good health and to ward off away evil spirits in the coming new year. The name \\"Day of Mankind\\" generates from the stipulation of no harm coming to humans on this day and the name \\"Festival of The Seven Herbs\\" comes from a tradition of store owners gathering and providing the seven lucky herbs to the emperor as nanakusagayu. The typical herbs used for the creation of nanakusagayu are nazuna, seri, gogyo, hotokenza, suzushiro, and hakobe. However, in some regions other variations are used. The tradition of eating nanakusagayu on the seventh day spread during the Heian period and by the Edo period those below the sh≈çgun would consume it the morning of this day prior to coming together to address the sh≈çgun. Another piece of reasoning behind the Japanese people eating nanakusagayu on the seventh day, Jinjitsu, is because it is also used as a day of rest. The soup mixture is easy on the stomach and is consumed to rest the digestive system that may have been weakened by the food that is consumed during the first days of the New Year. The name and tradition are derived from an ancient Chinese custom called Renri which means the day humans were born, whereby each of the opening days of the first lunar month were assigned to a particular creature or animal, which it was forbidden to kill or lay harm to on that day: thus the first seven days of the month were Chicken Day, Dog Day, Boar Day, Sheep Day, Cow Day, Horse Day, and Human Day. On these days, no harm was caused to these animals and on the seventh day there were no punishments handed out to criminals. It is also a legend that the goddess N√ºwa created the world and created animals on different days and humans were on the 7th day. The celebration of the feast in Japan was moved from the 7th day of the first lunar month to the 7th day of January during the Meiji period, when Japan adopted the solar calendar during its time of reform from isolationism to a more modern, global form of government. Also included in some the celebrations are the singing of folk songs or nanakusabayashi which are performed in some areas throughout Japan. Tradition runs strong throughout Japan and this is one of many that have stuck around over the centuries. References * A Japanese new year's tradition: Feast of the seven herbs of health!. (n.d.).

The spirocyclic compound spiro[5.5]undecane. DABCO, a heterocyclic, bridged bicyclic compound, formally named 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. A bicyclic molecule (bi = two, cycle = ring) is a molecule that features two joined rings.Michael. B. Smith, \\"Organic Chemistry: An Acid‚ÄîBase Approach\\", Taylor & Francis, 2011, Page 302, https://books.google.nl/books?id=gKPtYs0jyMcC Bicyclic structures occur widely, for example in many biologically important molecules like Œ±-thujene and camphor. A bicyclic compound can be carbocyclic (all of the ring atoms are carbons), or heterocyclic (the rings atoms consist of at least two elements), like DABCO. Moreover, the two rings can both be aliphatic (e.g. decalin and norbornane), or can be aromatic (e.g. naphthalene), or a combination of aliphatic and aromatic (e.g. tetralin). Three modes of ring junction are possible for a bicyclic compound:Thomas N. Sorrell, Organic Chemistry, University Science Books, 2006, Page 99, https://books.google.nl/books?id=txmp1aoCJp8C * In spirocyclic compounds, the two rings share only one single atom, the spiro atom, which is usually a quaternary carbon. An example of a spirocyclic compound is the photochromic switch spiropyran. * In fused bicyclic compounds, two rings share two adjacent atoms. In other words, the rings share one covalent bond, i.e. the so-called bridgehead atoms are directly connected (e.g. Œ±-thujene and decalin). * In bridged bicyclic compounds, the two rings share three or more atoms, separating the two bridgehead atoms by a bridge containing at least one atom. For example, norbornane, also known as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, can be viewed as a pair of cyclopentane rings each sharing three of their five carbon atoms. Camphor is a more elaborate example. C8, C9, and C11 bicyclic alkanes. The bridgehead atoms are the carbons from which three bonds radiate, like spokes:bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, bicyclo-[3.3.1]nonane, bicyclo[3.3.3]undecane. Nomenclature Bicyclic molecules are described by IUPAC nomenclature. The root of the compound name depends on the total number of atoms in all rings together, possibly followed by a suffix denoting the functional group with the highest priority. Numbering of the carbon chain always begins at one bridgehead atom (where the rings meet) and follows the carbon chain along the longest path, to the next bridgehead atom. Then numbering is continued along the second longest path and so on. Fused and bridged bicyclic compounds get the prefix bicyclo, whereas spirocyclic compounds get the prefix spiro. In between the prefix and the suffix, a pair of brackets with numerals denotes the number of carbon atoms between each of the bridgehead atoms. These numbers are arranged in descending order and are separated by periods. For example, the carbon frame of norbornane contains a total of 7 atoms, hence the root name heptane. This molecule has two paths of 2 carbon atoms and a third path of 1 carbon atom between the two bridgehead carbons, so the brackets are filled in descending order: [2.2.1]. Addition of the prefix bicyclo gives the total name bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. The carbon frame of camphor also counts 7 atoms, but is substituted with a carbonyl in this case, hence the suffix heptanone. We start with numbering the carbon frame at the bridgehead atom with the highest priority (methyl goes before proton), hence the bridgehead carbon in front gets number 1, the carbonyl gets number 2 and numbering continues along the carbon chain following the longest path, until the doubly substituted top carbon (number 7). Equal to norbornane, this molecule also has two paths of 2 carbon atoms and one path of 1 carbon atom between the two bridgehead carbons, so the numbers within the brackets stay [2.2.1]. Combining the brackets and suffix (now filling in the position of the carbonyl as well) gives us [2.2.1]heptan-2-one. Besides bicyclo, the prefix should also specify the positions of all methyl substituents so the complete, official name becomes 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one. When naming simple fused bicyclic compounds, the same method as for bridged bicyclic compounds is applied, except the third path between the two bridgehead atoms now consists of zero atoms. Therefore, fused bicyclic compounds have a \\"0\\" included in the brackets. For example, decalin is named bicyclo[4.4.0]decane. The numbers are sometimes omitted in unambiguous cases. For example, bicyclo[1.1.0]butane is typically called simply bicyclobutane. The heterocyclic molecule DABCO has a total of 8 atoms in its bridged structure, hence the root name octane. Here the two bridgehead atoms are nitrogen instead of carbon atoms. Therefore, the official name gets the additional prefix 1,4-diaza and the total name becomes 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

Saltwater intrusion can naturally occur in coastal aquifers, owing to the hydraulic connection between groundwater and seawater. Because saline water has a higher mineral content than freshwater, it is denser and has a higher water pressure. As a result, saltwater can push inland beneath the freshwater. Certain human activities, especially groundwater pumping from coastal freshwater wells, have increased saltwater intrusion in many coastal areas. Water extraction drops the level of fresh groundwater, reducing its water pressure and allowing saltwater to flow further inland. Other contributors to saltwater intrusion include navigation channels or agricultural and drainage channels, which provide conduits for saltwater to move inland. Sea level rise could also contribute to saltwater intrusion. Saltwater intrusion can also be worsened by extreme events like hurricane storm surges. Hydrology Cause and impact of saltwater intrusion At the coastal margin, fresh groundwater flowing from inland areas meets with saline groundwater from the ocean. The fresh groundwater flows from inland areas towards the coast where elevation and groundwater levels are lower. Because saltwater has a higher content of dissolved salts and minerals, it is denser than freshwater, causing it to have higher hydraulic head than freshwater. Hydraulic head refers to the liquid pressure exerted by a water column: a water column with higher hydraulic head will move into a water column with lower hydraulic head, if the columns are connected. The higher pressure and density of saltwater causes it to move into coastal aquifers in a wedge shape under the freshwater. The saltwater and freshwater meet in a transition zone where mixing occurs through dispersion and diffusion. Ordinarily the inland extent of the saltwater wedge is limited because fresh groundwater levels, or the height of the freshwater column, increases as land elevation gets higher. Causes =Groundwater extraction= Groundwater extraction is the primary cause of saltwater intrusion. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in many coastal areas of the United States, and extraction has increased over time. Under baseline conditions, the inland extent of saltwater is limited by higher pressure exerted by the freshwater column, owing to its higher elevation. Groundwater extraction can lower the level of the freshwater table, reducing the pressure exerted by the freshwater column and allowing the denser saltwater to move inland laterally. In Cape May, New Jersey, since the 1940s water withdrawals have lowered groundwater levels by up to 30 meters, reducing the water table to below sea level and causing widespread intrusion and contamination of water supply wells. Groundwater extraction can also lead to well contamination by causing upwelling, or upcoming, of saltwater from the depths of the aquifer. Under baseline conditions, a saltwater wedge extends inland, underneath the freshwater because of its higher density. Water supply wells located over or near the saltwater wedge can draw the saltwater upward, creating a saltwater cone that might reach and contaminate the well. Some aquifers are predisposed towards this type of intrusion, such as the Lower Floridan aquifer: though a relatively impermeable rock or clay layer separates fresh groundwater from saltwater, isolated cracks breach the confining layer, promoting upward movement of saltwater. Pumping of groundwater strengthens this effect by lowering the water table, reducing the downward push of freshwater. =Canals and drainage networks= The construction of canals and drainage networks can lead to saltwater intrusion. Canals provide conduits for saltwater to be carried inland, as does the deepening of existing channels for navigation purposes. In Sabine Lake Estuary in the Gulf of Mexico, large-scale waterways have allowed saltwater to move into the lake, and upstream into the rivers feeding the lake. Additionally, channel dredging in the surrounding wetlands to facilitate oil and gas drilling has caused land subsidence, further promoting inland saltwater movement. Drainage networks constructed to drain flat coastal areas can lead to intrusion by lowering the freshwater table, reducing the water pressure exerted by the freshwater column. Saltwater intrusion in southeast Florida has occurred largely as a result of drainage canals built between 1903 into the 1980s to drain the Everglades for agricultural and urban development. The main cause of intrusion was the lowering of the water table, though the canals also conveyed seawater inland until the construction of water control gates. Effect on water supply Many coastal communities around the United States are experiencing saltwater contamination of water supply wells, and this problem has been seen for decades. . Many Mediterranean coastal aquifers suffer for seawater intrusion effects .The consequences of saltwater intrusion for supply wells vary widely, depending on extent of the intrusion, the intended use of the water, and whether the salinity exceeds standards for the intended use. In some areas such as Washington State, intrusion only reaches portions of the aquifer, affecting only certain water supply wells. Other aquifers have faced more widespread salinity contamination, significantly affecting groundwater supplies for the region. For instance, in Cape May, New Jersey, where groundwater extraction has lowered water tables by up to 30 meters, saltwater intrusion has caused closure of over 120 water supply wells since the 1940s. Ghyben‚ÄìHerzberg relation The first physical formulations of saltwater intrusion were made by W. Badon-Ghijben (1888, 1889) and A. Herzberg (1901), thus called the Ghyben‚ÄìHerzberg relation. They derived analytical solutions to approximate the intrusion behavior, which are based on a number of assumptions that do not hold in all field cases. the Ghyben‚ÄìHerzberg relation In the equation, > z = \\\\frac{ \\\\rho_f} {(\\\\rho_s-\\\\rho_f)} h the thickness of the freshwater zone above sea level is represented as h and that below sea level is represented as z. The two thicknesses h and z, are related by \\\\rho_f and \\\\rho_s where \\\\rho_f is the density of freshwater and \\\\rho_s is the density of saltwater. Freshwater has a density of about 1.000 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) at 20 ¬∞C, whereas that of seawater is about 1.025 g/cm3. The equation can be simplified to > z\\\\ = 40 h. The Ghyben‚ÄìHerzberg ratio states that, for every meter of fresh water in an unconfined aquifer above sea level, there will be forty meters of fresh water in the aquifer below sea level. In the 20th century the vastly increased computing power available allowed the use of numerical methods (usually finite differences or finite elements) that need fewer assumptions and can be applied more generally. Modeling Modeling of saltwater intrusion is considered difficult. Some typical difficulties that arise are: * The possible presence of fissures and cracks and fractures in the aquifer, whose precise positions and extents are unknown but which have great influence on the development of the saltwater intrusion * The possible presence of small scale heterogeneities in the hydraulic properties of the aquifer, which are too small to be taken into account by the model but which may also have great influence on the development of the saltwater intrusion * The change of hydraulic properties by the saltwater intrusion. A mixture of saltwater and freshwater is often undersaturated with respect to calcium, triggering dissolution of calcium in the mixing zone and changing hydraulic properties. * The process known as cation exchange, which slows the advance of a saltwater intrusion and also slows the retreat of a saltwater intrusion. * The fact that saltwater intrusions are often not in equilibrium makes it harder to model. Aquifer dynamics tend to be slow and it takes the intrusion cone a long time to adapt to changes in pumping schemes, rainfall, etc. So the situation in the field can be significantly different from what would be expected based on the sea level, pumping scheme etc. * For long-term models, the future climate change forms a large unknown but good results are possible . Model results often depend strongly on sea level and recharge rate. Both are expected to change in the future. Mitigation Catfish Point control structure (lock) on the Mermentau River in coastal Louisiana Saltwater is also an issue where a lock separates saltwater from freshwater (for example the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks in Washington). In this case a collection basin was built from which the saltwater can be pumped back to the sea. Some of the intruding saltwater is also pumped to the fish ladder to make it more attractive to migrating fish.

It has numerous applications, ranging from software engineering (software construction and also software verification) to layout algorithms and picture generation. Graph transformations can be used as a computation abstraction. The basic idea is that if the state of a computation can be represented as a graph, further steps in that computation can then be represented as transformation rules on that graph. Such rules consist of an original graph, which is to be matched to a subgraph in the complete state, and a replacing graph, which will replace the matched subgraph. Formally, a graph rewriting system usually consists of a set of graph rewrite rules of the form L \\\\rightarrow R, with L being called pattern graph (or left-hand side) and R being called replacement graph (or right-hand side of the rule). A graph rewrite rule is applied to the host graph by searching for an occurrence of the pattern graph (pattern matching, thus solving the subgraph isomorphism problem) and by replacing the found occurrence by an instance of the replacement graph. Rewrite rules can be further regulated in the case of labeled graphs, such as in string-regulated graph grammars. Sometimes graph grammar is used as a synonym for graph rewriting system, especially in the context of formal languages; the different wording is used to emphasize the goal of constructions, like the enumeration of all graphs from some starting graph, i.e. the generation of a graph language ‚Äì instead of simply transforming a given state (host graph) into a new state. Graph rewriting approaches =Algebraic approach= The algebraic approach to graph rewriting is based upon category theory. The algebraic approach is further divided into sub-approaches, the most common of which are the double-pushout (DPO) approach and the single-pushout (SPO) approach. Other sub-approaches include the sesqui-pushout and the pullback approach. From the perspective of the DPO approach a graph rewriting rule is a pair of morphisms in the category of graphs and graph homomorphisms between them: r = (L \\\\leftarrow K \\\\rightarrow R) (or L \\\\supseteq K \\\\subseteq R) where K \\\\rightarrow L is injective. The graph K is called invariant or sometimes the gluing graph. A rewriting step or application of a rule r to a host graph G is defined by two pushout diagrams both originating in the same morphism k\\\\colon K\\\\rightarrow D, where D is a context graph (this is where the name double-pushout comes from). Another graph morphism m\\\\colon L\\\\rightarrow G models an occurrence of L in G and is called a match. Practical understanding of this is that L is a subgraph that is matched from G (see subgraph isomorphism problem), and after a match is found, L is replaced with R in host graph G where K serves as an interface, containing the nodes and edges which are preserved when applying the rule. The graph K is needed to attach the pattern being matched to its context: if it is empty, the match can only designate a whole connected component of the graph G. In contrast a graph rewriting rule of the SPO approach is a single morphism in the category of labeled multigraphs and partial mappings that preserve the multigraph structure: r\\\\colon L\\\\rightarrow R. Thus a rewriting step is defined by a single pushout diagram. Practical understanding of this is similar to the DPO approach. The difference is, that there is no interface between the host graph G and the graph G' being the result of the rewriting step. From the practical perspective, the key distinction between DPO and SPO is how they deal with the deletion of nodes with adjacent edges, in particular, how they avoid that such deletions may leave behind \\"dangling edges\\". The DPO approach only deletes a node when the rule specifies the deletion of all adjacent edges as well (this dangling condition can be checked for a given match), whereas the SPO approach simply disposes the adjacent edges, without requiring an explicit specification. There is also another algebraic-like approach to graph rewriting, based mainly on Boolean algebra and an algebra of matrices, called matrix graph grammars. covers this approach in detail. =Determinate graph rewriting= Yet another approach to graph rewriting, known as determinate graph rewriting, came out of logic and database theory. In this approach, graphs are treated as database instances, and rewriting operations as a mechanism for defining queries and views; therefore, all rewriting is required to yield unique results (up to isomorphism), and this is achieved by applying any rewriting rule concurrently throughout the graph, wherever it applies, in such a way that the result is indeed uniquely defined. =Term graph rewriting= Another approach to graph rewriting is term graph rewriting, which involves the processing or transformation of term graphs (also known as abstract semantic graphs) by a set of syntactic rewrite rules. Term graphs are a prominent topic in programming language research since term graph rewriting rules are capable of formally expressing a compiler's operational semantics. Term graphs are also used as abstract machines capable of modelling chemical and biological computations as well as graphical calculi such as concurrency models. Term graphs can perform automated verification and logical programming since they are well-suited to representing quantified statements in first order logic. Symbolic programming software is another application for term graphs, which are capable of representing and performing computation with abstract algebraic structures such as groups, fields and rings. The TERMGRAPH conference focuses entirely on research into term graph rewriting and its applications. Classes of graph grammar and graph rewriting system Graph rewriting systems naturally group into classes according to the kind of representation of graphs that are used and how the rewrites are expressed. The term graph grammar, otherwise equivalent to graph rewriting system or graph replacement system, is most often used in classifications. Some common types are: * Attributed graph grammars, typically formalised using either the single-pushout approach or the double-pushout approach to characterising replacements, mentioned in the above section on the algebraic approach to graph rewriting. * Hypergraph grammars, including as more restrictive subclasses port graph grammars, linear graph grammars and interaction nets. Implementations and applications Example for graph rewrite rule (optimization from compiler construction: multiplication with 2 replaced by addition) Graphs are an expressive, visual and mathematically precise formalism for modelling of objects (entities) linked by relations; objects are represented by nodes and relations between them by edges. Nodes and edges are commonly typed and attributed. Computations are described in this model by changes in the relations between the entities or by attribute changes of the graph elements. They are encoded in graph rewrite/graph transformation rules and executed by graph rewrite systems/graph transformation tools. * Tools that are application domain neutral: ** AGG, the attributed graph grammar system (Java) ** GP (Graph Programs) is a programming language for computing on graphs by the directed application of graph transformation rules. ** GMTE, the Graph Matching and Transformation Engine for graph matching and transformation.

On occasion, they have been admitted and granted a degree, despite not doing any classes, as reported in reliable sources. Animals are often used as a device to clearly demonstrate the lax standards of the awarding institutions. In one case, a cat's degree helped lead to a successful fraud prosecution against the institution that had issued it. On occasion, accredited institutions may have awarded mock degrees to animals for humorous purposes (e.g. UNSW awarded a dogtorate, not doctorate, degree to a dog); such cases are not included below. Cats =Colby Nolan= Colby Nolan was a housecat who was awarded an MBA in 2004 by Trinity Southern University, a Dallas-based diploma mill, sparking a fraud lawsuit by the Pennsylvania attorney general's office. Colby Nolan lived with a deputy attorney general. In looking to expose Trinity Southern University for fraud, some undercover agents had the then-six-year-old feline obtain a bachelor's degree in business administration for $299. On the animal's application, the agents claimed that the cat had previously taken courses at a community college, worked at a fast-food restaurant, babysat, and maintained a newspaper route. In response, the institution informed Colby that, due to the job experience listed on his application, he was eligible for an executive MBA which he could obtain for an additional $100. The transcript submitted by the agents claimed that Colby had a GPA of 3.5. Upon learning that the cat received the degree, Pennsylvania attorney general Jerry Pappert filed a lawsuit against Trinity Southern University. In the lawsuit, Pappert directed the diploma mill, which had used email spam to sell degrees, to provide restitution to anyone who had ordered a degree from them. In December 2004, the Texas attorney general obtained a temporary restraining order under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act against Trinity Southern and its owners, Craig B. and Alton S. Poe. The court also ordered the school's assets frozen. In March 2005, the Poes were assessed penalties of over $100,000 by the court and were ordered not to market or promote fraudulent, substandard degree programs or to represent their university as being accredited or affiliated with legitimate universities. It was reported that the Poes were also associated with Wesleyan International University and Prixo Southern University.

Early life Fred Norris is the son of Valija and Henry Nukis who were Latvian immigrants.\\"Fred Norris Is Not A Martian!\\". The Smoking Gun. June 27, 1997. Fred was raised in Manchester, Connecticut. By the time Fred, the second of two sons, was born, his parents' marriage was already troubled. His biological father left home when Fred was five, but those first few years were turbulent. \\"There was always tension and rage,\\" Norris remembers. \\"My father had an alcohol problem. When Dad came home, you hid in the closet because there was always something going on you'd rather not be a part of.\\" Fred spent most of his early childhood alone. When his older brother, Robert, wasn't using Fred as a human punching bag, the brother wanted nothing to do with him. So Fred would escape by reading books, taking long bicycle rides, or watching many afternoon TV reruns (whence came his encyclopedic knowledge of classic fifties TV). \\"I'd like to state for the record that every person on this show of Howard's, even Robin, at least had a father figure to guide them,\\" he says. \\"Me, I was on my own.\\" Despite the lack of guidance, Norris managed to navigate his adolescence without major incident. When Norris was 13 his mother married his stepfather, Lewis Norris, a cabinet maker, whom Norris credits with finally making his mother happy and unlike his own father his stepfather generally treated Norris with respect. Around this time he began playing guitar. Career A college student at the time, Norris first met Howard Stern while working the overnight shifts at WCCC, an AM and FM radio station in Hartford, Connecticut in the spring of 1979. He continued at WCCC after Stern's departure; though left the station in early 1981 to take a job at WAQY-FM in Springfield, Massachusetts. When Stern became a ratings hit at WWDC in Washington, D.C. that year, he was able to use his success as leverage to persuade the station to hire Norris, who started as the producer on Stern's show in October 1981. He later moved with Stern to New York to work at WNBC in September 1982, and has been with the show ever since. Acting Norris has also appeared in several small television and movie roles. He played a younger version of himself in Private Parts in 1997. He played a meter maid in Cruel Intentions in 1999. Most recently, he portrayed a head shop owner named Leon, on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in 2013. Personal life In 1994, Norris married Allison Furman, a woman he originally met on the \\"Dial-A-Date\\" segment of Stern's radio show. The couple have one daughter together, Tess in November 2002.\\"Fred Norris\\" . howardstern.com. Retrieved May 20, 2014. In 1993, Norris legally changed his name from Fred Leo Nukis to Eric Fred Norris. On the May 23, 1996 episode of The Howard Stern Show, Stern and the cast had an extended discussion with Norris about this. Norris did not reveal the motivation for the change. Although he did not like the name Fred, he kept it because \\"Fred Norris\\" was the name the public knew him by. On the November 13, 2006 episode, Norris was again asked about his motivation for the change. Norris revealed he changed his surname to that of his kindly stepfather, in order to remove from his life any association with his biological father. Norris further explained that his mother wanted to name him Eric at birth, but that his biological father had not allowed it because Eric was the name of his mother's former boyfriend. Norris's middle name Leo was selected by his godmother, the same woman who eventually eloped with his natural father.

It was discovered on 15 October 1941, by Finnish astronomer Liisi Oterma at Turku Observatory in Southwest Finland, and named after Henrik Walbeck.  Classification and orbit  The asteroid orbits the Sun in the central main- belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì3.6 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,694 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.29 and an inclination of 17¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Walbecks observation arc begins the night after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS taxonomy, the carbonaceous asteroid is characterized as a Cg-type, an intermediate between the C-type and G-type asteroids. = Lightcurves = In November 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Walbeck was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini. It gave a rotation period of 5.1607 hours with a brightness variation of 0.22 magnitude (). Two similar periods were obtained by David Romeuf and by a team of Hungarian astronomers (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Walbeck measures between 17.88 and 19.62 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.037 and 0.051. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.046 and a diameter of 19.60 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.5.  Naming  The minor planet was named in memory of Finnish scientist Henrik Johan Walbeck (1793‚Äì1822), astronomer and geodesist at the old Academia Aboensis who used the method of least squares to derive a good value for the Earth's flattening. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 April 1980 ().

Nassa mud snails, p. 142.Cone snails . Hawaiian Marine Life. Accessed 18 November 2008.Respiratory system. The apple snail website. Accessed 18 November 2008. Marine gastropods that have a siphon are either predators or scavengers.Los Marineros Marine Life. Caption Mollusca. Accessed 21 November 2008. Although in gastropods the siphon functions perfectly well as a tube, it is not in fact a hollow organ, it is simply a flap of the mantle that is rolled into the shape of a tube. In many marine gastropods where the siphon is particularly long, the structure of the shell has been modified in order to house and protect the soft tissue of the siphon. This shell modification is known as the siphonal canal. For a gastropod whose shell has an exceptionally long siphonal canal, see Venus comb murex. In the case of some other marine gastropod shells, such as the volute and the Nassarius pictured to the right, the shell has a simple \\"siphonal notch\\" at the anterior edge of the aperture instead of a long siphonal canal. The Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex is a defensive reflex which is found in sea hares of the genus Aplysia; this reflex has been much studied in neuroscience. =Siphon as a snorkel= Pomacea canaliculata, seen through glass, has reached its siphon up to the water surface to breathe air Engraving of Florida freshwater applesnail Pomacea paludosa; siphon on lower right Freshwater apple snails in the genera Pomacea and Pila have an extensible siphon made from a flap of the left mantle cavity. They use this siphon in order to breathe air while they are submerged in water which has a low oxygen content so they cannot effectively use their gill. Apple snails use the siphon in a way that is reminiscent of a human swimmer using a snorkel, except that the apple snail's siphon can be retracted completely, or extended to various lengths as needed.Respiratory system. The apple snail website, http://www.applesnail.net, accessed 26 February 2009. For these freshwater snails, the siphon is an anti-predator adaptation. It reduces their vulnerability to being attacked and eaten by birds because it enables the apple snails to breathe without having to come all the way up to the surface, where they are easily visible to predators. The shells of these freshwater snails have simple round apertures; there is no special notch for the siphon. Paired siphons of bivalves Four specimens of Panopea generosa in a seafood tank; the paired siphons (or \\"necks\\") of this species can be one meter long Veneridae with siphons out venerid Venus verrucosa showing paired siphons (upper inhalant and lower exhalant siphon), shell and foot. Those bivalves that have siphons, have two of them. Not all bivalves have siphons however: those that live on or above the substrate, as is the case in scallops, oysters, etc., do not need them. Only those bivalves that burrow in sediment, and live buried in the sediment, need to use these tube-like structures. The function of these siphons is to reach up to the surface of the sediment, so that the animal is able to respire, feed, and excrete, and also to reproduce.Bales, SL and Venable, S. 2007. Natural Histories: Stories from the Tennessee Valley. University of Tennessee Press. . p. 66.Barnes, H. (Ed.) 2008. Oceanography and Marine Biology CRC Press. . p. 77. The deeper a bivalve species lives in the sediment, the longer its siphons are. Bivalves which have extremely long siphons, like the geoducks pictured here, live very deeply buried, and are hard to dig up when clamming.Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. 2000.

Diagramatic drawing of the inside of one valve of a bivalve such as a venerid: pallial sinus on the lower left, at the posterior end of the clam Many bivalves that have siphons can withdraw them completely into the shell when needed, but this is not true of all species. Bivalves that can withdraw the siphons into the shell have a \\"pallial sinus\\", a sort of pocket, into which the siphons can fit when they are withdrawn, so that the two shell valves can close properly. The existence of this pocket shows even in an empty shell, as a visible indentation in the pallial line, a line which runs along parallel to the ventral margin of the shell.M. Alan Kazlev.

The bivalve's two siphons are situated at the posterior edge of the mantle cavity.Anatomy of a Bivalve . accessed 26 February 2009. There is an inhalant or incurrent siphon, and an exhalant or excurrent siphon.Siphons . accessed 26 February 2009. The water is circulated by the action of the gills. Usually water enters the mantle cavity through the inhalant siphon, moves over the gills, and leaves through the exhalant siphon. The water current is utilized for respiration, but also for filter feeding, excretion, and reproduction. =Feeding= Depending on the species and family concerned, some bivalves utilize their inhalant siphon like the hose of a vacuum cleaner, and actively suck up food particles from the marine substrate. Most other bivalves ingest microscopic phytoplankton as food from the general water supply, which enters via the inhalant siphon and reaches the mouth after passing over the gill.S.

Hyponome of cephalopods Nautilus belauensis seen from the front, showing the opening of the hyponome. The hyponome or siphon is the organ used by cephalopods to expel water, a function that produces a locomotive force. The hyponome developed from the foot of the molluscan ancestor.Class Cephalopoda: the Head-Feet Accessed 21 November 2008. Water enters the mantle cavity around the sides of the funnel, and subsequent contraction of the hyponome expands and then contracts, expelling a jet of water. In most cephalopods, such as octopus, squid, and cuttlefish, the hyponome is a muscular tube. The hyponome of the nautilus differs however, in that it is a one-piece flap that is folded over. Whether ammonites possessed a hyponome and if so what form it may have taken, is as yet not known.Discussion. http://palaeo-electronica.org/ Accessed 21 November 2008.

Although most widely known for their role as \\"cram schools\\", where children can study to improve scores, hagwons actually perform several educational functions:supplementary education that many children need just to keep up with the regular school curriculum, remedial education for the children who fall behind in their work, training in areas not covered in schools, and preparation for students striving to improve test scores and preparing for the high school and university entrance examinations (the university entrance exam is also called suneung (ÏàòÎä•)). Many other children, particularly younger children, attend nonacademic hagwons for piano lessons, art instruction, swimming, and taekwondo (ÌÉúÍ∂åÎèÑ). Most young children attend a hagwon.http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170109000747 Hagwon also play a social role; occasionally children ask to be sent because their friends attend. There also exist hagwons for adults, such as flower arrangement and driving instruction hagwons. The term is also sometimes used to describe similar institutions operated by Korean Americans in the United States. Children of all ages often attend hagwons, even those in the pre- school age bracket. It is not uncommon for students to be enrolled in several hagwons of different subject areas at once in addition to their normal school attendance. Hagwons often specialize in subjects like mathematics, foreign languages, science, arts, or music. Many hagwons also have adults as students, particularly those dedicated to teaching the English language. While some see hagwons as filling a need not being adequately met by the public school system, others see them as creating an unequal footing between the poor and rich in Korea. In 2008, it was reported that there were over 70,000 hagwons in South Korea with 47 percent of them focused on high school enrollment. History and regulations In 1885, Henry Appenzeller founded the Paichai school (Î∞∞Ïû¨ÎåÄÌïôÍµê) as a cover for his missionary work. At the time it was illegal to preach other religions in Korea. Although his main goal was to spread his faith, it was still used by Koreans to learn English. Private education, known as gwaoe (Í≥ºÏô∏), was banned by President Chun Doo-hwan (Ï†ÑÎëêÌôò) in 1980. It was felt the advantage of private education unfairly burdened the poor and to promote equality, all access to it was made illegal. Through the years the government has relaxed the restrictions on private education by increasingly allowing more individuals and organizations to offer private education until the ban was ruled unconstitutional in the 1990s. Korean courts have ruled that it may violate the constitution for the government to limit the amount of money hagwons can charge. In early 2008, the Seoul government was working on changes to the regulations to allow hagwons to set their own hours, citing individual choice as trumping regulation. However, the government reversed its position five days later. The regulations were criticized as ineffective because the city council possessed limited resources to monitor and enforce them. Along with these restrictions, hagwons also had to disclose their tuition amounts to the government so people could complain if the schools attempted to raise the tuition. The licenses of hagwons caught running false advertisements will be revoked. Hagwons are required to issue cash receipts. In July 2009, to help catch violators of these new regulations, the government started a program to reward people who reported them. The regulations were intended to reduce the cost of private education. However, some hagwons added weekend classes to compensate for shorter weekday classes. Other parents have sought out private tutors to make up for lost study time. Other hagwons simply ignored the regulations. It was reported in April 2009 that 67 percent of hagwons sampled were found to have overcharged for tuition. Forty percent were found to have charged parents over two times the registered tuition amount. In March 2008, the government prohibited school teachers from creating test questions for hagwons. It had been found that some teachers were leaking tests and test questions to hagwons, giving the students who attended those schools advantages when it came time to take the test. A petition was made in October 2009 by parents, teachers, students and hagwon owners to challenge the government's legislation regarding hagwon closing times in Seoul and Busan. The constitutional court ruled that the laws did not violate the constitution. The restriction was put in place for Seoul and Busan in the summer of 2009. In making the ruling the court said, \\"Because it‚Äôs important to secure sleep for high school students to overcome fatigue and for the sake of their growth, it‚Äôs difficult to say that [the ban] excessively restricts basic rights.\\" In April 2010 it was reported that there were over 25,000 hagwons registered with the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, with nearly 6,000 being in the Gangnam area. It was also revealed that local government councils other than Seoul had decided not to implement the 22:00 curfew. The curfew was seen as not having an impact on education fees and not addressing the real concern with private education. Despite the curfew, there have been attempts to get around this curfew among hagwons in Seoul.  Impact on real estate  A higher than average concentration of hagwons in the Gangnam-gu (Í∞ïÎÇ®Íµ¨) area, specifically Daechi-dong (ÎåÄÏπòÎèô), has been cited as the primary reason for an increase in real estate costs in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made some top schools relocate to the area; however, the schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents feel their children need to be associated with these schools in order to reach the upper levels of business and success. As more parents try to move to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300 percent of similar areas in Seoul. In 2003 the government had planned to develop a hagwon center in Pangyo to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam, yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only a couple weeks later. English-language instructors Native English speakers were hired as early as 1883 in Korea, originally out of need. The first teacher hired at the government-run Tongmunhak was Thomas Hallifax. Due to the preference for having native English speakers teach English, many native English-speakers are still hired to teach at hagwons in Korea. These hagwons may be only English schools or they could also be schools which have a variety of subjects including English. The minimum requirements for foreigners for such teaching positions are: citizenship of Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, or the United States, a clean criminal background check at the national level, and a bachelor's degree obtained in one of the aforementioned countries. In return for signing a one-year contract, the institute provides an instructor with a monthly salary, round-trip airfare from his or her country of origin, usually a rent-free apartment or housing stipend for the duration of the instructor's contract, and an additional one-month \\"severance pay\\" at the completion of the contract. Foreign instructors hold a mixed view of hagwons. Many instructors have had no significant issues with the hagwon they've worked at. Hagwon owners have complained about the challenge in finding truly qualified teachers. A group of English instructors first formed a labour union at a hagwon in 2005. Hagwons abroad In some English- speaking countries, hagwons exist for ethnic Koreans. In North America, about 75% of Korean-language supplemental schools have affiliation with churches.Hirvela, Alan. \\"Diverse Literacy Practices among Asian Populations: Implications for Theory and Pedagogy\\" (Chapter 5).

Chinese (buxiban) and Korean (hagwon) schools are the most dominant of these learning environments, while Japanese heritage schools (hoshuko) also exist in certain communities.\\" and \\"[...]while the large majority (around 75 percent) of Korean schools are affiliated with churches; these began to appear in the early 1970s (Zhou & Kim, 2006).\\" As of 2006, of the hagwons registered with the Korean School Association of America (KSAA), over 75% were affiliated with Korean churches. There are also secular formal hagwons and secular informal hagwons.Zhou and Kim, p. 12 The hagwons are equivalent to hosh≈´ jugy≈ç k≈ç (hosh≈´k≈ç) in ethnic Japanese communities and buxiban in ethnic Chinese communities. As of 2010, every year over 50,000 Korean Americans attend Korean heritage schools.Kang, p. 1. Korean schools were first established in Hawaii after 1903, when the first wave of Korean immigration came to the United States.Kang, p. 2. The modern generation of Korean supplemental schools were first established in the United States in the 1970s. At the time they were weekend schools that had a mission to preserve the Korean-American identity in its students. They taught the Korean language, managed the assimilation of Korean-American children, and offered afterschool tutoring programs. There were almost 500 schools registered with the KSAA by the end of the 1980s. Beginning in the 1990s there were also hagwons that were supplementary academic preparation programs like the ones in Korea.Zhou and Kim, p. 13 Kang Hee-Ryong, author of the PhD thesis White supremacy, racialization, and cultural politics of Korean Heritage Language Schools, wrote that the Korean heritage schools are \\"not simply a means of counter hegemony against the racializing forces\\" but instead the \\"product of compromises\\" between different generations of Korean Americans.

The mill stands above sea level and is able to take advantage of incoming sea winds. History The earliest mention of a mill is in church records, which indicate that the miller was fined in 1615. Budgen's 1724 map showed a mill on this site. The current mill was built around 1750 and was apparently insured against fire in 1774. The windmill ground flour for the Worthing area until 1897 when it was purchased by Colonel T F Wisden. A condition of sale was that the mill had to be kept in working order. It was retired to a role of grinding animal feed until 1905. During much of the 20th century the mill was neglected although in 1907 the wooden roundhouse was replaced with a concrete structure used as a tea-room. In 1959, the mill was taken into the care of Worthing Borough Council. Messrs E Hole and Son, millwrights of Burgess Hill renovated the mill in 1961 and fitted a new pair of stocks and four new sails. In March 1976 one of the sails was broken off in a gale, and the other three removed. An inspection of the mill revealed she was not in good repair. Worthing Town Council set up a restoration project. The roundhouse was rebuilt to better replicate the original in 1990 and the restored mill began grinding again in 1991. A granary rescued from East Grinstead was re-erected at the mill in 1994. In 1998 it was discovered that one of the stocks was split. A new stock was made from laminated larch and the sails were refitted. In early 2008, the three councillors from Salvington Ward, Mayor Heather Mercer, Cllr Jacqui Marsh and Cllr Noel Atkins, awarded the Mill Trust a total of ¬£3,000, from the Mayor's fund and the pilot Ward Budget Scheme, respectively. This will contribute to the refurbishment of the current gatehouse as a visitor information centre, which it is hoped will be completed by the end of 2009. Mythology Sadly, much has been written about Durrington Mill, (now called High Salvington Mill), which has found its way into official records and publications, but for which the original research appears to be lacking. This section attempts to dispel a number of these myths. When the economics of wind and water-powered mill was undermined by new, steam-powered roller mills, millers of the old school had to find new ways to make a living. At High Salvington, the miller's wife, who was regularly asked for a glass of water by tourists who had toiled up the hill, hit upon the idea of offering a cup of tea and charging for this service. Thus was the High Salvington Windmill tea- room initiated. After miller Scutt's suicide, subsequent \\"millers\\" chose to emphasise the Mill as a tourist attraction and made money by charging for refreshments and to climb the steps to look at the mill and its machinery. While this contributed to keeping the mill and its machinery intact, the \\"millers\\" elaborated and embellished the known history of the mill, and thus an extensive body of mythology was created to attract and excite visitors. These myths often have been quoted and cited, as various millers lent credence to their stories by publishing them in leaflets, available to the visiting public. =The myth of the Post Tree= A favourite myth is that of the mill's post being part of a tree that grew on the site, the roots of which extended many feet below the ground. Apart from the fact that no mills were built like this in the 1740s, once the raised floor of the tea-rooms was removed from the hexagonal concrete round-house constructed in 1907, it is clear that the post, as is to be expected, is suspended above the ground, by diagonal quarter bars held in place against the cross-trees, themselves resting on brick piers, and that the base of the post is wedged into the centre of the cross-trees, with the wedges used to balance the post and adjust for the varying distribution of weight in the buck as stones, sails and machinery are added or removed. This myth appeared in several publications, including an untitled leaflet published by St. Stephens Press, Bristol, in the 1950s. (It refers to 1897 as being \\"53 years ago\\", and the cover page bears text that includes \\"VISITORS to WORTHING should not fail to see THE 200 YEAR OLD WINDMILL With its wonderful Old Wooden Machinery\\"). According to this leaflet, \\"The post itself at Salvington is of great interest. About 20 years ago excavations were made at the base of it to discover what means had been used to plant it so firmly in the ground that it had borne the whole weight of the mill and withstood the winter storms for two hundred years. To the surprise of the diggers, 12 feet below the level of the ground, instead of coming to the end of the post, great roots were found stopping further progress, showing that a living oak had been trimmed and made use of as it stood.\\" The myth is refuted by Rex Wailes in his article \\"Some Windmill Fallacies\\", published in the 1961 volume of the Transactions of the Newcomen Society of Great Britain. =The \\"Worked in 1914\\" myth= \\"The mill is known to have worked again in 1914.\\" Brunnarius claims that the mill worked again in 1914, but at that time, the mill was fixed in one position, and the construction of the hexagonal concrete roundhouse prevented the mill from being winded a full 360 degrees. It was not until the restorers removed the corners of the concrete roundhouse in the 1970s, that the mill was able to turn fully. The restored wooden roundhouse, built to the pre-1907 design, which has replaced the concrete roundhouse, allows the mill to be winded 360 degrees. No evidence has been found to support Brunnarius' claim. =The \\"Fantail\\" myth= According to the Listed Buildings Register, maintained by English Heritage, the windmill at High Salvington is supposed to have a fantail. This data appears to have made its way into the National Monuments Record, (also maintained by English Heritage), which cites in its notes: () Originally Durrington Mill, now usually called Salvington Mill. Post type with round house and fantail. Date 1700 over the door. Machinery of the mill in working order. from page 21 of the 21 May 1976 edition of Worthing's publication of the List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. However, no evidence for this has ever been found, and when it was bought by Worthing Borough Council in 1959, winding the mill, as far as was possible‚Äîsee The \\"Worked in 1914\\" Myth), was achieved by means of pushing on the tail-pole. Various \\"old-timers\\" who helped the High Salvington Mill Trust reported that the inspector who is supposed to have visited the windmill in 1949 never came as far as High Salvington, so perhaps this is the source of the error. =The private house myth= The same National Monuments Record also cites a Field Investigator's comment, dated from 31 December 1970, which states, \\"Mill restored externally and in excellent condition. Now a private house\\". The reference for this is given as F1 ASP 31-12-70. Although a millers cottage did exist on the site it was demolished some decades ago to make way for access to properties built to the rear of the houses adjacent to the mill. The hexagonal concrete roundhouse of the mill, constructed in 1907/8, was still being used to serve teas in 1970 and there was no living accommodation either then or since. Restoration The mill under restorationInspection of the mill after the loss of a sail in 1976 revealed that the trestle had been weakened by Death Watch Beetles. The machinery and millstones were removed from the mill and placed in storage. A steel frame was constructed and used to support the mill whilst the trestle and crown tree were replaced. A new diameter brake wheel was constructed and fitted in 1985. One pair of sails was fitted in 1987 The sails were turning in the Great Storm of 1987 although the brake was on. The second pair of sails were fitted in 1988. The roundhouse was rebuilt in 1990 and the restored mill ground for the first time on 4 April 1991. In 2008 discovery of rope burns on the studding by the spout floor window revealed that this was probably originally a pop-hole through which the brake rope would have been dropped, thus allowing the miller to operate the brake from the side of the mill exterior, rather than from behind the mill, as had been the practice in recent years. The \\"millwrights\\" restoration and maintenance volunteer decided to improve the authenticity of the restoration and replace the window with a pop-hole and removable shutter. In July 2009 scaffolding was erected so that the exterior of the buck could be repainted. Window frames have also been repaired and repainted. Description High Salvington Windmill is a post mill with a single storey roundhouse. The mill rotates on a solid oak post which is in turn supported by a trestle of heavy pine quarter nars supported on two crosstrees, themselves resting on four brick piers. The trestle is protected by a wooden roundhouse, modelled on the pre-1907 structure. On top of the post, a Samson head is fitted and this supports the crown tree‚Äîa large, heavy oak timber to which the body of the mill is attached. The windmill has a pair of common sails and a pair of spring sails, carried by a wooden windshaft with a cast iron poll end. The mill has two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail. The head stones are Derbyshire Peak stones are used for rough grinding, while the tail stones are made from pieces of French Burrstone, embedded in plaster of Paris. These millstones were used for fine grinding. Each pair of stones is driven by its own wheel, called the head wheel and tail wheel. The Friends of High Salvington Mill have had to rebuild the head wheel, but the tail wheel, an original of a rare \\"compass arm\\" design, is now too fragile to be used for grinding. Tenter gear is installed to adjust the gap between the stones, and along with the usual system of levers adjustable via a tentering screw, the mill also has a rope attached that allows the miller to lift the half-ton (500 kg) runner stone, while governors adjust to the wind speed and raise or lower the gap accordingly.

This originally stood at - , it was built in the mid nineteenth century, possibly to supply water to steam engines which powered an aerial ropeway at a nearby quarry, or possibly to raise water from a cutting parallel to a series of lime kilns, for slaking the lime. The rotting remains of the pump were rescued by Andrew Norman who started the restoration, before its acquisition by the High Salvington Mill Trust, which has completed the restoration and installed it beside the existing windmill. The trestle has been embedded in solid foundations, on which the restored post has been mounted. The buck (body) has been restored and resized according to photographs of the original taken in 1929, and the gear ratio between the windshaft and crankshaft has been adjusted, with a new gear wheel cut. An easily removable roof has been installed and new sails have been designed and constructed. The visually restored windpump was unveiled on Sunday 11 May 2008, during National Mills Weekend. Errors in construction resulted in a set of rebuilt sails that rotated clockwise. In 2009 the sails have been rebuilt so that they now correctly rotate anti-clockwise. A pump was acquired and in July 2009 it was refitted. Installation of the pump and connection to the con rods take place in August and September 2009, which now allows the Glynde Wind Pump to raise water again for the first time in over fifty years. Nutley wind engine In 2013 the High Salvington Mill Trust acquired from a farm at Nutley, in many pieces, a 44 foot steel mast mounted with both a wind engine and above this, a wind generator. The wind generator was a later addition that would have prevented the successful operation of the wind engine. The original mast was split into two to provide a mast for the separated wind engine and generator. The wind engine is a Hercules oil-bath wind engine with an 8 foot diameter fan. Many parts were missing requiring the maintenance volunteers to research and make new parts. In 2020 a well pump was acquired and fitted to the wind engine. The wind generator has a 6-foot diameter two-bladed wooden impeller driving a Lucas 24V DC lorry generator capable of very high speeds. The volunteers have built a control box with a series of light bulbs so that the faster the impeller turns, the more lamps are lit, with the full 120 W output lighting all of the bulbs. Glynde Windpump (aka Beddingham Water Pump), Nutley Wind Engine and Nutley Wind Generator restored and operating on 28 June 2020 in High Salvington Windmill field. Public access High Salvington Windmill is open to the public, from 2:30 pm to 5 pm, every first and third Sunday of the months April through to September, inclusive. Volunteer \\"millwrights\\" meet at the site every Thursday evening, from 7 pm until 9 pm, and the first and third Sunday morning of every month throughout the year. All the maintenance and restoration work at the mill is carried out by the volunteers. Organised parties can also arrange to visit the site for guided tours at other times, by arrangement with the Visit organiser.

He is the editor-in-chief of the Metropolis newspaper the Daily Planet. The character maintains very high ethical and journalistic standards and is an archetypal image of the tough, irascible, but fair-minded boss. Pierre Watkin played the character in Superman serial, Jackie Cooper in Christopher Reeve Superman films, Frank Langella in Superman Returns and Laurence Fishburne in the DC Extended Universe, with John Hamilton and Lane Smith in Adventures of Superman and Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman TV series. Publication history The character Perry White was created for the radio serial The Adventures of Superman, voiced by actor Julian Noa. He appeared in the second episode, \\"Clark Kent, Reporter\\", which aired on February 14, 1940. He transitioned into the comic books later that year, appearing in Superman #7 (November 1940). In the Adventures of Superman television series episode \\"Crime Wave\\" and the Post-Crisis comic continuity, he was an award-winning journalist who served a term as Mayor of Metropolis. He worked as an assistant editor in the Daily Star under George Taylor before becoming editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet. His most well-known catchphrases are \\"Great Caesar's ghost!\\" and \\"Don't call me chief!\\". Fictional character biography =Golden and Silver Age= The earliest Superman comics shows Clark Kent and Lois Lane working for the newspaper the Daily Star and an editor named George Taylor. However, this was soon changed, with Perry White first appearing as the editor of a newly renamed the Daily Planet.Superman (volume 1) #7 (November‚ÄìDecember 1940) In the 1960s and 1970s DC Comics, after the multiverse method of continuity tracking was implemented, the above inconsistency was explained away by declaring that on Earth-One (the Silver Age universe), Perry White is Clark and Lois' employer at the Daily Planet, while on Earth-Two (the Golden Age universe), George Taylor is that world's editor-in-chief of the Daily Star. The Perry White of Earth-Two is a lead reporter for the Daily Star and, according to a Superman Family tale, has \\"filled in\\" as editor from time to time while Taylor was away. Prior to the changes detailed in Crisis on Infinite Earths, Perry begins his career as a freelance reporter for various newspapers, including a Chicago newspaperSuperman (volume 1) #142 (January 1961) and Gotham City's Gotham Gazette.World's Finest Comics #80 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1956) He eventually goes to work at the Daily Planet as a reporter, and earns his first Pulitzer Prize by being the first to write about Superboy's extraterrestrial origins, thanks to an exclusive interview with the Boy of Steel.New Adventures of Superboy #12 (December 1980) Later still, Perry's reporting skills earn more praise after being the first to discover that Superboy has moved to Metropolis from Smallville. (Superboy had intended to keep his move quiet for an undefined period of time, so as not to alert anyone to Superboy and Clark Kent leaving Smallville around the same time.)Superman (volume 1) #366 (December 1981) Finally, during Clark Kent's junior year of college, Perry is promoted to editor-in-chief of the newspaper, after the retirement of the paper's previous editor, the Earth-One version of George Taylor.Superman: The Secret Years #4 (May 1985) In the early 1970s, the Daily Planet is bought by Morgan Edge, president of the media conglomerate Galaxy Communications, with much of Perry's power in running the paper overtaken by Edge.Superman (volume 1) #233 (January 1971) In the months just prior to the Crisis \\"reboot\\" in 1985, it is implied that Perry White is beginning to succumb to Alzheimer's disease, manifesting in increased forgetfulness and confusion. =Modern Age= With writer John Byrne's post-Crisis on Infinite Earths revamp of Superman's origin in the Man of Steel miniseries and his subsequent Superman comics, Perry's history was fleshed out more fully. Post-Crisis, Perry is born in Metropolis' Suicide Slum area, growing up with a father missing after heading off to war overseas. He becomes a copy boy at the Daily Planet, beginning a lifetime career that will take him up the newspaper's career ladder. Perry goes to school with Lex Luthor while they are children (Luthor was also born in Suicide Slum). After Luthor becomes a successful businessman, he begins diversifying his holdings in his newly founded LexCorp company, which includes buying the Daily Planet. Luthor soon sells it after deciding to pursue technology and television investments. Turning down an offer from Luthor to become part of Luthor's new television station WLEX, Perry finds an investor who saves the Daily Planet on the condition that Perry is promoted from reporter to managing editor. The entire episode, not the least of which is what Perry felt as having been forced out of his active writing career, leaves Perry bitter and angry with Luthor. Perry marries Alice Spencer and has a son, Jerry White. Much later, after Jerry is fully grown, Perry learns that Lex Luthor is Jerry's biological father. Luthor briefly seduces Alice while Perry is overseas reporting on a war and thought to be killed. Perry White's two greatest moves as the editor are hiring of Lois Lane and (later) Clark Kent. When she was 15, Lois had impressed Perry with her persistence in trying to get employment at the newspaper (by lying about her age). After Jerry White dies from a gunshot, Perry and Alice grieve for some time, resulting in Perry taking a leave of absence from the Daily Planet. Later, Perry and Alice adopt an orphaned African-American boy named Keith Robert Parks, who soon has his name changed to Keith Robert White. At about this time, Perry takes another leave of absence for lung cancer treatment, putting Clark Kent in charge as the Planet's temporary editor. After many grueling months of chemotherapy, the cancer goes into remission. One of Perry's proudest moments is attending the wedding of Lois and Clark. He sits in the front row beside Lois' parents (Lois considers him as close a relative as her own family).Superman: The Wedding Album (December 1996) As the paper continues to struggle, the Planet's owner Franklin Stern sells the paper to Lex Luthor. Luthor, acting out of pure malice, dismantles the paper. He fires everyone except Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and two others who are relocated to Lexcom, Lex' new Internet-based news company. Shortly thereafter, Lex sells the Planet to Bruce Wayne for $1 (thanks to a secret deal with Lois Lane). White is hired back as editor-in- chief, and the entire former staff is hired back as well. Though Perry's knowledge of Clark's alter ego is uncertain, it is known that he has found a dusty suit of his star reporter's clothes in a supply closet, including his passport. For this reason, Perry may well suspect that Clark and Superman are the same person, but due to his personal admiration for both Clark and Superman, he has never confided this suspicion or knowledge to anybody. Bruce Wayne believes that because of White's superior skill as a reporter, he knows that Clark is Superman (\\"Perry White is too good a reporter not to have uncovered Clark's secret. And yet, he acts otherwise... reminding me how good a detective Jim Gordon is back in Gotham City...\\" -Batman: Hush). Perry's editorship keeps the Daily Planet as one of the few newspapers that dare to heavily criticize Luthor (even after Luthor's successful election as President of the United States). Because of the changes in Superman's history in recent years, including 2003-2004's miniseries Birthright, much is not certain about Perry's history. In Final Crisis #2, Lois and Perry are caught in an apparently fatal explosion triggered by Clayface at the Daily Planet. As of Final Crisis #3, it was revealed that Perry is alive, but on life support. Perry has since then recovered, however, and is now back to running the paper. When the world begins to grow increasingly more paranoid towards the new population of Kryptonians, Lois begins to investigate the conspiracies executed by the US Government, and her father General Lane in particular. However, the government becomes aware of Lois' actions, and attempt to shut her down. As a result, Perry is unable to print any of Lois' stories because of General Lane's power. Unwilling to let this slide, Perry suggests that Lois 'quit' the paper so as to continue her investigation.Action Comics #884 (February 2010) In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock\\", Perry White has changed the name of the article revolving around \\"The Superman Theory\\" much to the dismay of Lois Lane at the time when she and Clark Kent think that someone is pulling the strings behind this theory.Doomsday Clock #5. DC Comics. Other versions *In the limited comic series DC Universe Online: Legends, Perry White was captured, alongside Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, in the Daily Planet by Brainiac, but was saved by Superman, with Lex Luthor in possession of the canister containing them.DC Universe Online Legends #2 (April 2011)DC Universe Online Legends #9 (August 2011) Later, Perry became one of the people who has gained metahuman abilities from Braniac's Exobytes, transforming his body into a being of Ice and granting him Ice powers, which has surprised him.DC Universe Online Legends #10 (August 2011) Later he adopted the code name Frost.DC Universe Online Legends #20 (February 2012) *In the limited series All-Star Superman, Perry remains the boss of the Daily Planet and publishes an article that incriminates Lex Luthor, resulting in his arrest and sentenced execution. *In the limited series Superman: Red Son, Perry is the editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet, eventually succeeded by Lois Luthor. * In the tie-in comic to Young Justice, Perry is at Bibbo's Diner, where Bibbo comments on the behavior of his other guests, but Perry doesn't respond. Five years later, Perry was at the front door of the Daily Planet when a spaceship launched a device that hovered over Metropolis, burrowing into the ground. Perry walks over to the crater and watches as it starts digging a hole through the ground. In other media =Animation= * The Superman Fleischer cartoons from the 1940s featured a Daily Planet only referrer to as ‚ÄúMr. White‚Äù in the short because at the time Perry White was used in the radio serial and George Taylor was featured in the comics. * The 1966 series The New Adventures of Superman featured the character voiced by Jackson Beck. * Perry also appears in Challenge of the Super Friends episode \\"Super Friends, Rest In Peace\\", voiced by William Woodson. Superman tries to rescue him and Lois Lane from Luthor and Solomon Grundy at the time they had the Noxium Crystal in their possession. * The 1988 Superman TV series showed a Perry White (voiced by Stanley Ralph Ross) modeled after his comic book counterpart but with a tough attitude, similar to the movie series. * The 1990s Superman: The Animated Series featured Perry White voiced by George Dzundza, that only interacted with the characters in the Daily Planet. This version of the character had cameos in the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited animated series. Dzundza reprised his role as Perry White in the 2006 direct- to-video animated film Superman: Brainiac Attacks. * Perry White appears in Superman: Doomsday, voiced by Ray Wise. Here, he is bald but shares the same characteristics as the comics counterpart. * Perry White appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Battle of the Superheroes\\", voiced by Richard McGonagle. He says his lines \\"Great Caesar's ghost\\" and \\"Don't call me Chief.\\" * Perry White appeared in All-Star Superman, voiced by Ed Asner. * Perry appears in Superman: Unbound voice by Wade Williams. * Perry White appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Superman's Pal, Sid Sharp\\", voiced by Piotr Michael. He quoted \\"Great Ceasar's Ghost\\" when he was giving his opinion on Daily Bugle reporter Sid Sharp's idea for a new superhero following Clark Kent beating him to the story where Superman stopped some bank robbers using technology from Apokolips. Following Superman and Sid Sharp escaping from Apokolips, Sid Sharp goes to tell Perry White the experience he had which he told to the other staff members only to find that Clark Kent managed to get a scoop. Though Clark Kent secretly allowed Sid Sharp to take the credit for the story. *Rocky Carroll voiced the character in the films The Death of Superman and Reign of the Supermen. After Lois Lane gives Doomsday his name on live television during the creatures battle with Superman across Metropolis, Perry orders the Daily Planet's staff to name Doomsday as the headline of the newspaper's new page 1, which Cat Grant speculates no one will be left to read it if Doomsday isn't stopped. =Television= * In the 1950s Adventures of Superman television and radio series, Perry was played by John Hamilton, who typically barked \\"Great Caesar's ghost!\\" when angry, exasperated, or surprised. (The phrase became the title and theme of an episode.) His other trademark line was \\"Don't call me 'chief'!\\" Both of these lines eventually became staples in the comics. In at least one episode, it is revealed that Perry has served a term as mayor of Metropolis before becoming editor-in-chief on the Planet. In the episode \\"Drums of Death\\", Perry White has a sister named Kate. In the episode \\"Jet Ace\\", Perry White has a nephew named Chris. * In February 1975, ABC aired a TV movie based on the failed 1966 Broadway musical It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman starring then- Password host Allen Ludden in the role of Perry White. The movie was narrated by Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In announcer Gary Owens and Ludden's castmates included Lesley Ann Warren, Al Molinaro, and Loretta Swit. The movie is viewable on YouTube. * Perry White's son, T. J. White, was a supporting character in the Superboy television series. Perry White himself never appeared in the show; however, he did appear in the second issue of the tie-in comic book series, in which T.J. was kidnapped by an organized crime family on which Perry did an expos√©. * Perry White appears in the 1990s television series Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, played by Lane Smith. Perry was a Baby Boomer with an abiding fondness for rock and roll, particularly Elvis Presley. Instead of \\"Great Caesar's ghost!\\", he sometimes said \\"Great shades of Elvis!\\", and the comics briefly followed suit. In a subplot that carried over many episodes, Perry is portrayed as having marital difficulties with his wife Alice due to his dedication to the paper. The couple later reunites just before the series finale. * In the 2000s television series Smallville, Perry White appears in the season 3 episode \\"Perry\\" and is portrayed by Michael McKean. In this show, he is a multiple Pulitzer-nominated reporter formerly working for the Daily Planet, who gets reduced to tabloid television after attempting to expose Lionel Luthor's corrupt dealings. He attempts to regain some of his old reputation by exposing Clark's powers, but the plan backfires when a random solar flare temporarily nullifies Clark's abilities, although Clark's subsequent heroism despite his currently-powerless status prompts Perry to both abandon the idea that Clark has powers and cause him to consider turning over a new leaf, even offering to give Clark a recommendation into journalism as a career in future. The phrase \\"don't call me Chief\\" was worked into this episode, when White irritates Sheriff Nancy Adams by calling her \\"Chief\\". It's later implied in the season 4 episode \\"Gone\\" that Perry is working his way back up with an article on Lionel's conviction. He reprised his role in the season 9 episode \\"Hostage\\" as the new boyfriend of Senator Martha Kent (Martha's actress Annette O'Toole is married to McKean in real life), who returns from Washington to visit her son Clark. In the series finale, it is shown that Perry White became the editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet. Michael McKean provided the voice of Perry White in the very last scene of the final episode but the actor himself was not seen on screen, although the famous \\"Great Caesar's ghost\\" ranting was heard as he was scolding Lois Lane to get back to work. =Film= * Pierre Watkin played Perry White, in the serials Superman (1948) and Atom Man vs. Superman (1950). * In the 1978 film Superman: The Movie (and its three sequels from the 1980s), Jackie Cooper played Perry as a tough character, who never let his reporters forget he had worked for the Planet nearly all his life. The \\"don't call me 'chief'\\" line was worked into a gag about ordering coffee, and became \\"don't call me 'sugar'!\\" (when he orders a coffee with sugar, and Jimmy Olsen calls him chief and he tells him not to call him \\"sugar\\"). Cooper's Perry was also fond of aphorisms such as \\"A good reporter doesn't get great stories ‚Äî a good reporter makes them great.\\" In the commentary track for Superman, director Richard Donner reveals that Cooper got the role because he had a passport, and thus was able to be on set in a few hours, after Keenan Wynn, who was originally cast, suffered a heart attack. * In Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, Perry White was originally going to be portrayed by Hugh Laurie. But when it was determined that there would be a schedule conflict involving Laurie's TV series House (which was, incidentally, executive produced by Singer), Laurie was forced to drop out and Frank Langella stepped in to play Perry White. In this movie, Perry has a nephew, Richard White, who is engaged to Lois and serves as a father figure to her son Jason, although it is implied over the course of the film that Jason's biological father is Superman himself. * Laurence Fishburne portrays Perry White in the DC Extended Universe, making him the first African-American to play Perry White in a live- action film. ** In Man of Steel, while his position does not deviate from the comics, his view of Superman is somewhat different. Rather than seeing the existence of a powerful alien as a major scoop, he believes such a discovery will warrant a negative reaction from the people of Earth. When a blogger that Lois Lane met with about Superman appears on TV and mentions Lois' encounter with him, Perry White calls up Lois stating that the FBI have visited the Daily Planet and advises her to turn herself over to them. At the film's climax, he and Steve Lombard aid a reporter named Jenny Jurwich when she is trapped under debris. At the end of the film, White introduces Lois and Lombard to Clark. ** In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, he tries to convince Clark to focus on publishing a sports article rather than investigate the actions of Batman in Gotham. When Superman is killed, Perry is shown holding a paper which has both Superman and Clark Kent's deaths published (with a cover-up story by Lois claiming that Clark was a bystander killed in the fight against Doomsday) and silently mourned for their deaths. In the Ultimate Edition, Perry and fellow reporter Jenny Jurwich appear at Clark Kent's funeral in Smallville. =Video games= * Perry White appeared in Superman for the NES. * George Dzundza reprised his role as Perry White in the video game Superman: Shadow of Apokolips. * Perry White appears in Lego Dimensions, voiced by Brian Bloom. * Perry White appears as an NPC in Lego DC Super-Villains, but he can be created through the character customiser.

Caesium vapor is used to optimize the electrode work functions and provide an ion supply (by surface ionization or electron impact ionization in a plasma) to neutralize the electron space charge.  Definition  From a physical electronic viewpoint, thermionic energy conversion is the direct production of electric power from heat by thermionic electron emission. From a thermodynamic viewpoint, it is the use of electron vapor as the working fluid in a power-producing cycle. A thermionic converter consists of a hot emitter electrode from which electrons are vaporized by thermionic emission and a colder collector electrode into which they are condensed after conduction through the inter-electrode plasma. The resulting current, typically several amperes per square centimeter of emitter surface, delivers electrical power to a load at a typical potential difference of 0.5-1 volt and thermal efficiency of 5-20%, depending on the emitter temperature (1500-2000 K) and mode of operation.  History  After the first demonstration of the practical arc-mode caesium vapor thermionic converter by V. Wilson in 1957, several applications of it were demonstrated in the following decade, including its use with solar, combustion, radioisotope and nuclear reactor heat sources. The application most seriously pursued, however, was the integration of thermionic nuclear fuel elements directly into the core of nuclear reactors for production of electrical power in space. The exceptionally high operating temperature of thermionic converters, which makes their practical use difficult in other applications, gives the thermionic converter decisive advantages over competing energy conversion technologies in the space power application where radiant heat rejection is required. Substantial thermionic space reactor development programs were conducted in the U.S., France and Germany in the period 1963‚Äì1973, and the US resumed a significant thermionic nuclear fuel element development program in the period 1983‚Äì1993. Thermionic power systems were used in combination with various nuclear reactors (BES-5, TOPAZ) as electrical power supply on a number of Soviet military surveillance satellites between 1967 and 1988. See Kosmos 954 for more details. Although the priority for thermionic reactor use diminished as the US and Russian space programs were curtailed, research and technology development in thermionic energy conversion have continued. In recent years technology development programs for solar-heated thermionic space power systems were conducted. Prototype combustion-heated thermionic systems for domestic heat and electric power cogeneration, and for rectification, have been developed.  Description  The scientific aspects of thermionic energy conversion primarily concern the fields of surface physics and plasma physics. The electrode surface properties determine the magnitude of electron emission current and electric potential at the electrode surfaces, and the plasma properties determine the transport of electron current from the emitter to the collector. All practical thermionic converters to date employ caesium vapor between the electrodes, which determines both the surface and plasma properties. Caesium is employed because it is the most easily ionized of all stable elements. A thermionic generator is like a cyclic heat engine and its maximum efficiency is limited by Carnot's law. It is a low-Voltage high current device where current densities of 25-50 (A/squarecm) have been achieved at voltage from 1-2V. The energy of high temperature gases can be partly converted into electricity if the riser tubes of the boiler are provided cathode and anode of a thermionic generator with the interspace filled with ionized Caesium vapor. The surface property of primary interest is the work function, which is the barrier that limits electron emission current from the surface and essentially is the heat of vaporization of electrons from the surface. The work function is determined primarily by a layer of caesium atoms adsorbed on the electrode surfaces. The properties of the interelectrode plasma are determined by the mode of operation of the thermionic converter. In the ignited (or ‚Äúarc‚Äù) mode the plasma is maintained via ionization internally by hot plasma electrons (~ 3300 K); in the unignited mode the plasma is maintained via injection of externally produced positive ions into a cold plasma; in the hybrid mode the plasma is maintained by ions from a hot-plasma interelectrode region transferred into a cold-plasma interelectrode region. Recent work All the applications cited above have employed technology in which the basic physical understanding and performance of the thermionic converter were essentially the same as those achieved before 1970. During the period from 1973 to 1983, however, significant research on advanced low- temperature thermionic converter technology for fossil-fueled industrial and commercial electric power production was conducted in the US, and continued until 1995 for possible space reactor and naval reactor applications. That research has shown that substantial improvements in converter performance can be obtained now at lower operating temperatures by addition of oxygen to the caesium vapor,J-L. Desplat, L.K.

Similarly, improvements via use of oxygen-containing electrodes have been demonstrated in Russia along with design studies of systems employing the advanced thermionic converter performance. Recent studies have shown that excited Cs-atoms in thermionic converters form clusters of Cs-Rydberg matter which yield a decrease of collector emitting work function from 1.5 eV to 1.0 ‚Äì 0.7 eV. Due to long- lived nature of Rydberg matter this low work function remains low for a long time which essentially increases the low-temperature converter‚Äôs efficiency.

Metallo is usually depicted as a cyborg with a kryptonite power source in his heart, which he uses as a weapon against Superman. In 2009, Metallo was ranked as IGN's 52nd-greatest comic book villain of all time.  Publication history  John Corben and Metallo first appeared in the Superman comic strip storyline \\"The Menace of Metallo\\", which ran from 15 December 1958 to 4 April 1959. The character debuted in comic books in Action Comics #252 (May 1959), in a story by Robert Bernstein and Al Plastino. There was an earlier \\"Metalo\\" who appeared in World's Finest #6 (Summer 1942). This was just a man who discovered the most powerful metal on earth and invented a strength serum.  Fictional character biography  = The Golden Age Metalo = The Golden Age Superman battled an unnamed scientist calling himself Metalo who wore a powered suit of steel armor.World's Finest Comics #6 (Summer 1942) Years later, Superman encountered the villain a second time.Superman Family #217 (April 1982) Metalo (now named George Grant) had a new suit of armor and had also taken a serum to increase his strength to superhuman levels. He exposed Superman to a ray that reduced his power significantly giving Metalo superior strength in their first battle. Superman engaged in a lengthy regimen of exercise and training to restore his powers and returned to easily defeat Metalo. = First Silver Age Metallo = Cover of Superman Family #217 (April 1982). Artwork by Rich Buckler (pencils) and Dick Giordano (inks). A different Metallo appeared as Jor-El's robot to battle Superboy in Superboy #49 (1956). = John Corben = John Corben was originally a journalist (and secretly a thief and murderer) who had just committed what he thought was the perfect murder. While fleeing from the scene of the crime, he suffered a near-fatal accident that mangled his body beyond repair. An elderly scientist, Professor Vale, happened to come upon him and used his scientific skill to transfer Corben's brain into a robotic body covered by a flesh-like artificial skin. Corben discovered that his power source, a capsule of uranium, would only last a day, but was told by Vale that kryptonite would provide him an indefinite power supply. After obtaining a job with the Daily Planet, Corben briefly tried to romance Lois Lane, while deciding that he would use his powers to eliminate Superman, the one person who might expose his criminal deeds. After setting a kryptonite death-trap for Superman, Corben stole what he thought was another sample of kryptonite from a museum as a new power supply, not knowing it was a fake prop; this mistake caused him to die, just as he was about to kill Lois Lane for discovering that he was not Superman (as he had pretended to be, being super-strong and invulnerable as a cyborg). Superman eventually escaped from the kryptonite trap and arrived just after Metallo (John Corben) had died.Action Comics #252, (May 1959) = The Bronze Age Metallo / Roger Corben = A second Metallo, John's brother Roger Corben, debuted in Superman #310 (April 1977) by Curt Swan and Martin Pasko. This Metallo was created by a secret organization named \\"SKULL\\" that transferred Roger's brain into a new robotic body so that he could get revenge on Superman for his brother's death. Like the previous Metallo, this one was also powered by kryptonite, although this newer version wore orange and green armor, as well as a green helmet to conceal the \\"new\\" identity he had created using plastic surgery (which turned out to be WGBS Staffer Martin Korda). This version of Metallo returned throughout the Bronze Age. His final appearance was featured in Alan Moore's \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\\" (1986).Superman #423 = The Modern Age Metallo = John Byrne in Superman (volume 2) #1 (January 1987) After John Byrne rewrote Superman's origins in the 1986 miniseries The Man of Steel, Metallo was also given an altered backstory. In this version, John Corben was a small-time con man who was fatally injured in a car crash, but thanks to luck, Professor Emmet Vale happened to pass by. Professor Vale was a pioneer in robotics and erroneously believed that Superman was the first in a wave of superpowered Kryptonian invaders after recovering Superman's ship and mistranslating Jor-El's message to his son. Vale transplanted Corben's brain into a robotic alloy body, which was powered by a two-pound chunk of kryptonite, and instructed him to kill Superman. Metallo, now Corben's new moniker, thanked Vale by snapping his neck and killing him. Despite ignoring Vale's commands, Metallo came into conflict with Superman on various occasions, largely due to his continued activities as a petty thug. Metallo later lost his kryptonite heart to Lex Luthor, though back-up life support systems allowed him to reactivate himself and escape. He remained a thorn in Superman's side and was powerful enough to cripple the Doom Patrol. Still, the Indian-born hero who called herself Celsius did blow him apart with her thermal powers. Metallo later received a major upgrade via an unholy bargain with the demon Neron. As a result, Metallo could morph his body into any mechanical shape he could imagine (turning his hands into guns or \\"growing\\" a jet-pack from his back) and project his consciousness into any technological or metallic device. He could also grow to monstrous size. During one battle, his gigantic fists were separated and later turned into housing by other superheroes. In another incident, Metallo was rendered more insane by the Joker and used his height to destroy an elevated train of commuters. As Superman and others learned on various occasions, the most effective way to neutralize Metallo was to remove his (largely invulnerable) head and isolate it from other metallic items. In Superman/Batman #2 (November 2003), Lex Luthor fabricated evidence implicating John Corben as the criminal who shot and killed Thomas and Martha Wayne, the parents of Bruce Wayne.Superman/Batman #2  Superman: Secret Origin  In the 2009‚Äì10 miniseries Superman: Secret Origin, (which retells the origins of Superman and his supporting cast), Metallo is Sgt. John Corben. He serves under Lois Lane's father, General Sam Lane. General Lane is trying to push his daughter, Lois into a relationship with Corben. Though they had one date, she does not return his feelings for her. Corben is next seen signing up for a military option to neutralize Superman (ostensibly with the help of a powersuit built by LexCorp). However, in his first encounter with Superman, a stray bullet hit the Kryptonite rock inside the suit, leading to a disastrous energy cascade within the battlesuit which almost killed Corben. Through the efforts of Lex Luthor and a crack team of scientists, Corben survived, part-man, part- machine, with the Kryptonite rock functioning as his new heart. Driven by a hatred for this alien invader, he became the villain known as Metallo. Metallo, now wearing a green, orange and red armor, subsequently attacked Superman again in a rampage which endangered not only the citizens of Metropolis, but his own fellow soldiers. He was defeated by Superman once more. = The New 52 = In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, John Corben is under the command of General Sam Lane.Action Comics Vol. 2 #1 (September 2011) General Lane tells him to talk to Lois Lane, when she keeps questioning where Superman is. It is implied that Corben and Lois once had a relationship. When Superman escapes from the military's custody, Corben is seen enlisting in what appears to be a military project co-opted by Lex Luthor, General Lane, and young scientist Doctor John Henry Irons‚Äî\\"Project Steel Soldier\\"‚Äîto go against Superman.Action Comics Vol. 2 #2 (October 2011) Corben is seen in the \\"Metal 0\\" suit with scientists, mostly Irons, trying to help him. He continues believing that he did it for the affection of Lois and when the robotic needles are in his head, Metallo takes control and his heart bursts. Metallo then screams \\"Where is Superman?\\"Action Comics Vol. 2 #3 (November 2011) Although the attack on Superman succeeds, Metallo is revealed to have been subverted by Brainiac as part of his own plans, and his rampage is defeated when Doctor Irons uses an armoured suit of his own to fight Corben and upload a computer virus that he designed in the event of such a situation.Action Comics Vol. 2 #4 (December 2011) After escaping, and still under Brainiac's control, Corben continued to fight SupermanAction Comics Vol. 2 #7 (March 2012) until he was able to reason with Metallo and to fight Brainiac's influence because of his feelings for Lois Lane. In doing so, Corben attacked Brainiac until Superman could defeat the villain, but he subsequently fell into a coma and was taken back by the army.  Forever Evil  It was revealed that the armor was keeping him alive thanks to alien technology, but without a heart he would soon die. General Lane told his scientists to find a way to save him since he helped to save Metropolis. He was later given a kryptonite heart to keep him alive since it was the only energy compatible with his cybernetics.Action Comics Vol. 2 #8 (April 2012) After 31 months in a vegetative state, Corben was brought back with a shard of kryptonite to active duty in the U.S. Army. Since his actions caused the deaths of hundreds of civilians, General Lane tried to kill him by exploding the plane he was being carried in. He survived and sought vengeance against Lane at his base, only to be confronted by an upgraded soldier like himself \\"Metal-2.0\\". When Corben proves too much, Metal-2.0 activates his self-destruct mechanism, hoping to destroy Corben along with himself. However, he is saved by the Scarecrow and offered a place in the Secret Society of Super Villains, now calling himself Metallo. In \\"Forever Evil\\", Ultraman rips off his kryptonite heart, because of his addiction to the mineral.Forever Evil #4  Doomed  Corben was eventually seen again incarcerated in John Henry's isolated super-prison, eventually drafted by the U.S. government again shortly afterwards, but is only brought back into their service by compunction from Lois once more (who was secretly under Brainiac's influence).Action Comics Vol. 2 #31 (July 2014) Given the present danger he represents as Doomsday was taking him over, Lois convinced Metallo to run Superman down in a kryptonite bombing run and was summarily incinerated by the blast; all that was left of him being the Metal Zero exo-mantel fused to his now-charred remains.Action Comics Vol. 2 #32 (Aug. 2014) Lois, now completely subsumed by the Brainiac consciousness inside of her, is able to recreate Corben's essential self by downloading her memory of the man he was into what was left of his old Metal-0 suit, said facsimile of the now-deceased military sergeant a loyal echo of whom he once was, obedient to her every whim.Superman/Wonder Woman #10 (Sept. 2014) He would serve as her bodyguard as Dox's influence compelled her to cripple military defense systems around the world. He would immediately switch sides once Lois is freed from his control, however, and aid her in combating the alien threat to their world.Action Comics Annual #3 (Sept. 2014) As Superman and Lois departed to stop Brainiac, Metallo was left on Earth to defend Metropolis in their stead.Action Comics Vol. 2 #34 (Oct. 2014) After the crisis is resolved, Corben is later seen standing guard over Metropolis with Krypto, seemingly contented with his current position.Action Comics Vol. 2 #35 (Nov. 2014)  Truth/Savage Dawn  In the wake of Superman's identity being outed to the world as the hero began losing his powers, many an investigation was undertaken into his identity, contacts and motives by collective interests. Seeing as her life was in more danger than ever before, Metallo stuck close to his love as she went and did some investigating of her own in the meantime.Batman/Superman #23 (Oct. 2015) While Vandal Savage made his play for ultimate power, Lois and Metallo were close by on the scene where Superman kept his warship from crushing a small town. While aiding Superman, as Lois refused to leave his side during the battle with Savage's empowered progeny, John's bionic shell was badly damaged. Looking to make good with all the bad in his life, he willingly offered his kryptonite heart to Superman (the depowered hero having discovered a treatment for his loss of powers that essentially involved giving himself chemotherapy with kryptonite), knowing full well that he could not survive without it.Superman Vol. 3 #49 (April 2016) = DC Rebirth = Metallo is briefly a member of a new version of the Superman Revenge Squad, also consisting of General Zod, Mongul, Cyborg Superman, Eradicator, and Blanque. After Superman is temporarily blinded, they are defeated when Lex Luthor, Supergirl, Superwoman, Kong Kenan, and Steel come to Superman's aid. Action Comics (vol. 3) #979-984  Powers and abilities  Metallo's metallic body offers him a high degree of protection from physical and energy attacks. He has enhanced abilities and no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe. His brain is hermetically sealed inside a shielded alloy skull that has its own power supply. When he was first created, he was powered by a kryptonite heart; losing that, he subsisted on plutonium instead. Additionally, because of his cyborg body, Metallo possesses superhuman strength and speed, enough to pose a challenge and even a threat to opponents such as Superman (in that case, he also takes advantage of the weakening power of kryptonite besides his own strength). Over the course of his criminal career Metallo's body would be decimated constantly by various circumstances. As such he would receive numerous upgrades or whole new chassis' to replace his damaged parts, such as by the obscure supervillain organization Cerberus, which modified him with a vastly superior body, one with lead-lined skull-plating and an anatonic layer that even Superman could not demolish.Adventures of Superman #491 (1987) This gave him greatly enhanced strength and durability, coupled with moderate mechanical regeneration to repair internal damage.Action Comics #678 (1938) He was later outfitted with a larger LexCorp tech body, which gave him laser vision and further augmented his physical abilities.Damage #1 (1994) Soon after it was destroyed, Corben had received a new body from fellow Kryptonite-powered supervillain Conduit; which gave Metallo radioactive blasts from his hands and could utilize geomagnetism to make him physically immovable, even by the Man of Steel, so long as he stood on solid ground or flooring within a building complex.Action Comics #710 (1938) Metallo would eventually sell his soul (or what was left of it) to the archdemon Neron in return for increased power,Steel Vol. 2 #21 (November 1995) and Underworld Unleashed #1 (November 1995) gaining the abilities to mentally control and absorb any mechanical or metal object he focuses on and transforming any technology (himself included) into an extension of his exo-skeleton (an ability similar to the Cyborg Superman). In experimenting with his newfound abilities, Metallo found he could alternate differing energy frequencies for harnessing and redistributing it from various power sources.The Adventures of Superman #546 Brainiac 13 upgraded Metallo to tap into various light spectra to better utilize his kryptonite-charged abilities. His mechanical body was also upgraded to be able to grow towards monolithic proportions.Superman: The Man of Steel #98 He is also occasionally portrayed as having a liquid metal-based endoskeleton, possessing the ability to morph parts of his body, specifically his limbs, into different weapons or tools, such as chainsaws, shovels, hammers, etc. While not a genius like Lex Luthor or Brainiac, Corben's time spent with machines has given him a gifted understanding of how they work, enabling him to tinker with their mechanical functions even before gaining his technomorphing capabilities.Doom Patrol #10 (1987) During the publishing of Salvation Run it is revealed Metallo also boasts a high-calculus cyber-mind with which to run the numbers of possible and probable outcomes and success scenarios through. In the previous continuity, the Pre-Flashpoint Lex Luthor modified Corben to holster and utilize different forms of kryptonite; boasting mutagenic red-k, inverted blue-k and lastly, artificial depowering gold-k on top of the green-k he already possessed.Action Comics Annual #10 He could even power a great many anti-Kryptonian armaments developed by Luthor through it.Action Comics Annual #11  Other versions  *Metallo appeared in Superman: Red Son as a project (among many others) invented by Dr. Lex Luthor for the U.S. government to combat Superman, who serves Communist Russia.Superman: Red Son #3 *Marvel Comics cover-featured an unrelated character named Metallo in Tales of Suspense #16 (April 1961). * The Silver Age Metallo appears in the series Justice.Justice #4 * In Art Baltazar's Superman Family Adventures, Jack Corben was an astronaut who became sick after flying through a kryptonite asteroid field. Lex Luthor manipulates him into believing that it was all Superman's fault and that he can help Jack if Jack defeats Superman. Jack gets the upper hand in the fight with his kryptonite, but the Superman family is aided by John Henry Irons into trapping Jack in a lead case. This version is not a cyborg, but instead has a large metallic armor that contains all his kryptonite poisoning.Superman Family Adventures #6 In other media =Television= Live-action * In the second-season Superboy episode \\"Metallo\\", Roger Corben (played by Michael Callan), a bungling bank robber, tries to rob an armored car even though he is having extreme chest pains. Superboy arrives and apprehends the bank robber, but the small-time crook has a heart attack and is taken to a hospital. After a lengthy recuperation, he escapes by murdering his doctor. After he leaves, he suffers another heart attack and his car crashes into a tree and explodes. The police assume he is dead, but journalist Clark Kent is not so sure. Meanwhile, Corben is alive. He falls into the hands of a mentally-unbalanced doctor who turns him into more of a machine than human being and replaces his failing human heart with the radioactive power source kryptonite. As Metallo, Corben made several more appearances in the Superboy series, specifically in the episodes \\"Super Menace\\", \\"People Vs. Metallo\\", \\"Threesome\\" (parts 1 and 2), and \\"Obituary for A Super-Hero\\". * In the second-season Lois & Clark episode \\"Metallo\\", Johnny Corben (played by Scott Valentine) was Lucy Lane's boyfriend and, unknown to her, a petty criminal. Not only does he have a criminal past, but he's hitting up Lucy for money. Lois Lane tries to convince her sister that Johnny's no good, but Lucy will hear none of it. Johnny was shot when a holdup went wrong and having fallen into the hands of Dr. Emmett Vale, a former LexCorp scientist with the help of his brother Rollie Vale, rebuilt Johnny into a Kryptonite-powered cyborg named Metallo and begins causing havoc in Metropolis. And, since Metallo is powered by Kryptonite, even Superman can not stop him. When Metallo kidnaps Clark to use him as bait to lure Superman, it's up to Lois and Jimmy Olsen to save Clark, but nothing can save Metallo after a final run-in with Superman, who, now aware of his kryptonite power source, keeps his distance, using his super breath and heat vision to defeat him. Emmett is captured, but Rollie manages to escape with Metallo's kryptonite, leaving Metallo dead. Brian Austin Green as John Corben on Smallville * In Smallville, John Corben/Metallo (played by Brian Austin Green in season nine, uncredited actor in season ten) appears in the season premiere \\"Savior\\" as a former war reporter working at the Daily Planet alongside Lois Lane. In \\"Metallo\\", he is revealed to despise the Blur (Clark Kent) because the latter rescued a prisoner that went on to murder Corben's sister. After being hit by a truck, he is experimented upon by Major Zod's Kandorian soldiers and wakes up with bionic appendages, including a kryptonite-powered artificial heart, and targets the Blur in revenge for his sister. Clark, though weakened by the kryptonite radiation, uses a lead plate to defeat Corben, who is recovered by LuthorCorp CEO Tess Mercer. In \\"Upgrade\\", Corben's prior insanity was explained as a flaw in his kryptonite heart and Tess' scientists repair him and turn him into a mindless weapon. Corben defeats Zod and a red kryptonite- infected Clark, regaining his free will after the control chip is removed from his head. Corben goes underground after receiving from Lois a red kryptonite heart. Despite regaining his sanity and parting on good terms with Lois and Clark, he is back to being a villain with a green kryptonite heart in \\"Prophecy\\", as a part of Toyman's team of villains, \\"Marionette Ventures\\": he is assigned to target Supergirl. He appears in the comic book continuation Smallville: Season Eleven which explains his character change as his biology rejecting the red kryptonite heart and he became a mercenary, tasked by a tyrannical dictatorship in rural country to subdue and eliminate a protector of the rebel forces; who was secretly the Kryptonite empowered Lana Lang. His new Green-K heart given to him by Toyman, had the ability to absorb meteor rock energy signatures serving to make him that much more powerful. When he absorbed the kryptonite powered nanites in Lana Lang's Prometheus augmented biology, they gave him the ability to reach out and assimilate any metallic or mechanical constructions within range, similar to his comic book appearance's technomorphing abilities. He was finally stopped and incarcerated by the U.S. government when Lana and Lois managed to incapacitate him by removing his power source. =Arrowverse= There are six different versions of Metallo who appear in Arrowverse: * John Corben appears in the episode \\"The Adventures of Supergirl,\\" portrayed by Frederick Schmidt. He was initially hired by the then-arrested Lex Luthor to assassinate his sister Lena Luthor to prevent her from rebranding Luthor Corp. His first two attempts to kill Lena fail due to the intervention of Supergirl and Superman and his third attempt is foiled by Alex Danvers and Lena who shoots Corben when he tries to take Alex hostage. While being sent to the hospital, he is intercepted by Project Cadmus who perform an experiment to convert him into Metallo. After meeting Project Cadmus' leader (who was later revealed to be Lex Luthor's mother Lillian), Metallo is unleashed on Supergirl and Superman. While Superman fought the other Metallo, Supergirl received help from Alex Danvers to remove his Kryptonite heart. Afterwards, Supergirl used Metallo's eyes to speak to Project Cadmus to let them know that she will find them. He later is busted out of jail via a smuggled synthetic Kryptonite \\"heart\\" brought in by Hank Henshaw (who also doctored the security footage to make it seem as though Lena Luthor had been the one who smuggled in the heart as part of an elaborate plot to both frame Lena and force her to aid her mother). However, because the synthetic Kryptonite was unstable, Corben was slowly undergoing a radiological meltdown, and ultimately perished via self-destruction despite Supergirl's best efforts to save him. * Aside from Corben, Project Cadmus scientist Dr. Gilcrist (portrayed by Rich Ting), was also subjected unwillingly to be the second Metallo model by Lillian Luthor. During his fight with Superman, Martian Manhunter removed Dr. Gilcrist's Kryptonite heart shutting him down. * An entirely robotic Metallo, voiced by Frederick Schmidt, features in the four-part crossover story \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\", linking the shows Supergirl, Arrow, The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow. It appears as the servant of a Nazi regime led by Oliver Queen and Kara Zor-El, and takes the primary heroes of the aforementioned shows captive. It is eventually destroyed by the combined powers of the shows' characters, the Flash, Black Canary, Killer Frost, Citizen Cold, the Ray, the Atom, Firestorm, Heat Wave, Zari, Vibe, and Vixen. This marks the first live-action representation of Metallo's appearance in the comics, all previous media having depicted him as mostly human-looking. * Another version of Metallo appears in Supergirl, this version being Otis Graves (played by Robert Baker). He first appeared in the season 4 premiere \\"American Alien\\" as human, and was so until his apparent death (along with his sister Mercy), in the episode \\"Ahimsa\\" at the hands of a Hellgrammite. He is then seen in the episode \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" as alive, but not stated how. It is then revealed in the episode \\"Crime and Punishment\\" that Lex Luthor and Eve Teschmacher resurrected him with Kryptonite, in an updated version of the Metallo suit. He is later killed by Ben Lockwood. * A fifth Metallo appears in the Supergirl season 4 episode \\"All About Eve\\". This version is an unnamed man who guards Eve Teschmacher's lab at National City University * In an alternative reality created by Mxyzptlk in the episode \\"Its a Super Life\\", Lena Luthor (portrayed by Katie McGrath) suffered an accident that left her gravely injured. Her mother used Cadmus' resources to transform him into a Metallo, but this was reversed when Mxyzptlk regained his powers. Animation Metallo, as depicted in Superman: The Animated Series * John Corben/Metallo appears in several animated series set in the DC Animated Universe: ** He made his debut in Superman: The Animated Series, voiced by veteran actor Malcolm McDowell. John Corben was originally an English criminal-for-hire, who was eventually caught and jailed by Superman. During his time in prison, Corben contracted a rare and fatal disease. His past employer (and the person responsible for Corben being infected by the disease), Lex Luthor, then offered him a new lease on life by transferring his consciousness into a robotic body, and in exchange Corben would kill Superman for Luthor. The android body is made of an indestructible alloy called \\"Metallo\\", and is powered by a kryptonite power source to use against the Man of Steel. However, Corben soon learned that his new body had no sense of taste, smell or touch, and this sensory deprivation drove him insane. Realizing he was no longer the man he once was, Corben dubbed himself \\"Metallo\\", and took brutal pleasure in trying to kill or torture Superman, usually with his kryptonite core. ** Metallo returns in the Justice League episode \\"Hereafter\\", voiced by Corey Burton. He appears as a member of the Superman Revenge Squad. ** Malcolm McDowell reprised his role as Metallo in Justice League Unlimited, where he is a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society. He, along with Silver Banshee, are sent on a mission to Skartaris to obtain a large kryptonite rock, but are ultimately defeated by the Justice League. When he attempts to tell the League about the new Secret Society, his brain is fried by a protocol Grodd secretly programmed into him. * Metallo appeared in season 5 of the animated series The Batman, voiced by Lex Lang. His kryptonite heart is not in his center, but in the upper left quadrant of his chest. Also, Metallo has a back-up power source and can operate without the kryptonite heart. Metallo was paid by Lex Luthor to kill Superman. Because of the kryptonite, Superman fought a losing battle until Batman and Robin showed up. They managed to get the kryptonite out of Metallo long enough for Superman to recover. After he recovered, Superman defeated Metallo by trapping him in a hydraulic compactor, although it is said that a certain type of battery keeps him alive. His origin is not given. * Metallo makes a cameo appearance as one of the villains Superman and Batman take down together in Batman: The Brave and the Bold. Superman is wrestling with Metallo on top of a building when Metallo exposes his kryptonite heart and weakens Superman. Batman comes and uses a grappling hook to pull the kryptonite heart from the center of Metallo's chest. Metallo is then easily beaten by Superman with one punch. His design is like the Bronze Age Metallo although much bulkier than Superman. * Metallo appears in the Justice League Action animated short \\"True Colors\\", voiced by Chris Diamantopoulos. In an attempt to help Superman by turning Metallo's kryptonite heart into lead, Firestorm turns it into different versions of kryptonite instead, each having different effects on Superman. After Pink Kryptonite turns Superman into a woman, she defeats Metallo and Firestorm manages to turn his heart to lead. * Metallo appears in Harley Quinn. He appears in \\"L.O.D.R.S.V.P.\\" as a member of the Legion of Doom. =Film= * Metallo appears in the animated movie Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, which is based on Jeph Loeb's 2003 comic book story arc of the same name that appeared in the Superman/Batman comic book. In the movie, Metallo is voiced by John C. McGinley. He acts as Lex Luthor's bodyguard who then fights with both Superman and Batman. After they escape him, he is killed by Major Force and his death is used to frame Superman, although a cursory analysis of his body by Batman confirms that he was killed by a radiation blast rather than heat vision. * Metallo makes a brief appearance in All-Star Superman. He is seen lifting weights when Lex Luthor, escorted by armed guards, and Clark Kent (who is interviewing Lex Luthor), walk past his glass cell. He looks up when they pass by. Clark Kent seemed to shy away from Metallo's cell since it was not made of lead. This led to Parasite's escape from his cell near Metallo's since Parasite easily absorbed Clark Kent's power from a few meters away. The only reason Superman was not affected by the kryptonite heart was because his overcharged powers made him impervious to it. * Metallo appears in the animated film Justice League: Doom, voiced by Paul Blackthorne. He is part of Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom, and is his counterpart to Superman. He is more lighthearted than his fellow Legion members, as shown by his attempts to shake Bane's hand after saying he was a fan of Bane's work, and openly laughing when Vandal Savage presents his plan. He draws Superman's attention by posing as Daily Planet reporter Henry Ackerson and heading to the top of the building itself, claiming to commit suicide. Lois Lane tells Superman about Ackerson, and the Man of Steel flies onto the roof and convinces him not to jump. Metallo then pulls out a gun containing a kryptonite bullet and shoots Superman in the chest and exposing his Kryptonite heart before knocking Superman off the roof and into the streets below. Despite mocking Savage's plan initially, he takes part in it. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, Metallo fights Superman, gaining the upper hand using his kryptonite heart to weaken the Man of Steel. Despite holding off Superman for most of the fight, once Savage launches his missile Superman slammed the plating containing Metallo's heart over the kryptonite, forcibly trapping it before Superman uses his heat vision to decapitate Metallo. Metallo's head was most likely reattached and he was put into custody. * Metallo appears briefly in the 2018 film The Death of Superman as a hologram in the Hall of Justice's training room, and is noted within a newspaper headline as having been defeated by Cyborg Superman in the 2019 animated feature Reign of the Supermen. * Metallo was initially considered to be the antagonist in Zack Snyder's Man of Steel sequel, but the project was eventually cancelled in favor of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It was then revealed that Metallo was going to be a villain in an earlier draft of Dawn of Justice using the body of Wallace Keefe. It was rumored he was going to be in the final fight between Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman instead of Doomsday but this was never confirmed. His creator, Emmet Vale, appears in Dawn of Justice, portrayed by Ralph Lister. =Video games= * Malcolm McDowell reprises his role as Metallo in Superman: Shadow of Apokolips as the final boss. * Metallo appears as one of the bosses in Superman: The New Adventures. * Metallo appears as one of the bosses in Superman: The Man of Steel, voiced by Roger L.

To cover his tracks, Luthor ensured that the suit's psionic interface was unstable, leaving Corben a complete vegetable. He was 'rescued' by Doctor Schwarz, a disgruntled former LexCorp employee, who had been tracking the capsule that brought the infant Superman to Earth and stole this from the Kents' farm. Having built Corben an android body powered by the capsule's kryptonite power source, they hatched a plan to kill Lex Luthor and Superman. Metallo double-crosses Schwarz and breaks his neck. Kidnapping Lois Lane, Metallo holes up at the power station at Two Mile Island waiting for Superman to face him. During the ensuring battle, Lex Luthor steps in and tears out Metallo's kryptonite heart. =Toys= His DC Universe Classics action figure is a 'Collect and Connect' figure in Wave 5 featuring the Riddler (head & torso), the Atom (right arm), the Eradicator (left arm), Amazo (right leg), and Black Lightning (left leg).

The railroad spans over numerous different rail lines, most of which radiate out of Albany, Georgia. Primary commodities include corn, scrap metal, chemicals, ethanol, cement, paper, cottonseed, clay wood pulp, peanuts, fertilizer, beer, aggregates and others, generating 21,000 annual carloads.  History  Upon its start on April 14, 1995 the railroad was named the Georgia and Florida Railroad and was a Gulf & Ohio subsidiary operating over two lines: Albany to Sparks, and Valdosta to Nashville over former Norfolk Southern (NS) trackage. Initially the railroad consisted of approximately of track over two separate branches, including trackage rights over NS to link the disconnected lines. The railroad initially hauled grain, peanuts, fertilizer, woodchips, and beer, totaling around 10,000 carloads. =Albany-Sparks= The Albany-Sparks route consists of two different routes meeting at Moultrie. The Albany-Moultrie portion was completed by the Georgia Northern Railway in 1905. In 1966, the Southern acquired the Georgia Northern and it was merged with the Albany & Northern Railway subsidiary. The second section from (Moultrie-Sparks) was originally constructed by the Sparks Western Railway, however, the railroad was acquired by the Georgia & Florida Railway (G&F;) in 1910, with the line being completed in 1911. The G&F; became a subsidiary of the Southern in 1963. Both sections officially became part of NS in 1990 and were leased to G&F; in 1995. = Valdosta-Nashville = The Valdosta-Nashville section was built by the Douglas, Augusta & Gulf Railway and became part of G&F; around 1906. G&F; later became part of the Southern in 1963 and NS in 1990. In early 2005 changes came to the branch as the Georgia Department of Transportation purchased the line from G&F;, including an additional section of exempted track from Nashville to Willacoochee, , owned by the city of Willacoochee. Under the agreement, G&F; would continue to operate the line from Valdosta to Willachoochee. Cater Parrott Railnet now operates this line. = Live Oak, Perry & South Georgia = Starting around 1896 the South Georgia Railroad built a line south from a point near Adel to Quitman. The line was extended further to Greenville, Florida in 1901 where it met the South Georgia & West Coast Railway, which ran from Greenville to Perry, Florida. The entire line was later reorganized as the South Georgia Railway. In 1971 the Southern Railway acquired the line and merged it with a separate line, the Live Oak, Perry and Gulf, to form the Live Oak, Perry, and South Georgia. On December 15, 1995 the LOP&SG; was purchased as a subsidiary of Gulf & Ohio. The railroad ran from Adel, Georgia to Foley, Florida, , and was operated by the Georgia & Florida. = Consolidation and Acquisition by RailNet = On January 21, 1999 Gulf & Ohio consolidated its holdings in the region under a single entity and sold the new network - including the two branches of the neighboring Atlantic & Gulf railroad - to RailNet. The new railroad was renamed Georgia and Florida RailNet. = OmniTRAX = OmniTRAX acquired the entire Georgia & Florida RailNet in 2005, renaming the railroad Georgia and Florida Railway. A boon came to the railroad in 2006 as an ethanol plant was planned for Camilla, Georgia. The new facility was expected to generate significant traffic for the line when it opened in late 2008. However, due to financial difficulties experienced by the facility, it is unclear whether the effect on the G&F; railroad will remain. = 2019 Shots Fired Incident = On May 17, 2019, a Georgia and Florida train was fired upon by a group of juveniles in the vicinity of the Flint River bridge in Albany, Georgia. One round struck a cab window, causing approximately $300 in damage. The juveniles are still being sought by the Albany, Georgia Police Department.

In 1988, the sanctuary was enlarged to include the Great Vedaranyam Swamp and the Talaignayar Reserve Forest, and renamed the Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary, with a total area of 377 km2. Point Calimere is home to the endangered endemic Indian blackbuck and is one of the few known wintering locations of the spoon-billed sandpiper. It also holds large wintering populations of greater flamingos in India. The area is dotted with salt pans and these hold large crustacean populations that support the wintering bird life. Pesticide residues running off from agricultural fields and shrimp farms has entered the ecosystem and many species have high concentrations of DDT and HCH in their tissue. Point Calimere is also associated with the mythological Hindu epic, The Ramayana. The highest point of the cape, at an elevation of 4 m, is Ramarpatham,\\"Rama's feet\\" in Tamil.

The screenplay by Peter Hyams and Stirling Silliphant is based on the 1975 novel by Walter Wager. Plot After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Soviet Union planted a number of long-term, deep-cover sleeper agents all over the United States, spies so thoroughly brainwashed that even they did not know they were agents and can be activated only by a special code phrase. (The phrase is a line from the Robert Frost poem \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\", followed by the agent's real first name.) Their mission was to sabotage crucial parts of the civil and military infrastructure in the event of conflict. More than 20 years pass, and the Cold War gradually gives way to d√©tente. Narrowly escaping a relentless purge of old Stalinism loyalists, Nikolai Dalchimsky (Donald Pleasence), a rogue KGB headquarters clerk, travels to America, taking with him the Telefon Book which contains the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all the sleeper agents. He starts activating them, one by one. American counterintelligence is thrown into confusion when seemingly ordinary citizens blow up what were formerly top secret facilities that have since become relatively inconsequential, and then either commit suicide or die in the act itself. The KGB dares not tell its political leaders, much less the Americans, about its negligence in not deactivating the spy network. KGB Major Grigori Borzov (Charles Bronson), who is selected for his photographic memory, memorizes the contents of the only other copy of the Telefon Book. He is then sent to find and stop Dalchimsky quietly, before either side learns what is happening, which would greatly embarrass the KGB and possibly even start a war between the powers. Borzov is given the assistance of only a single agent, Barbara (Lee Remick), planted in America years before. Eventually, Borzov realizes the method behind Dalchimsky's pattern of attacks: he has chosen the agents by the first letters of their American hometowns, \\"writing\\" his own name in sabotage across America. Using that information, Borzov is able to anticipate Dalchimsky's next chosen sleeper agent, and locate and kill Dalchimsky. However, there are a number of twists. Barbara has orders from the KGB to assassinate Borzov once he succeeds, to get rid of a dangerous loose end. In addition, she is a double agent actually working for America. When she informs her American superior, Sandburg (Frank Marth), he also tells her to kill Borzov, so she will retain the confidence of the KGB. However, Barbara has fallen in love with her would- be target. She informs Borzov, and together they blackmail both sides into leaving them alone, holding the threat of the remaining Telefon agents over their heads.

During filming, the crew had to order two truckloads of snow needed for one of the scenes, because the chinook winds in the area took away snow they had. They were trucked from the mountains. Filming in downtown Great Falls was also included. The exploding building in one scene is actually the controlled demolition of the old Paris Gibson Junior High School. The explosion scene was filmed on February 20, 1977. The present day Paris Gibson square was undamaged, but the explosion started roof fires on a couple of nearby houses that were quickly extinguished by city firefighters hired by the movie company on stand by. The Houston scenes were shot on a Hollywood backlot, while the interior of the Houston Hyatt Regency was portrayed by 5 Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, California ‚Äì the location which was also used in The Towering Inferno.

Most of the material is from the second BBC series of Monty Python's Flying Circus, with a few newly written pieces. One track, \\"Stake Your Claim\\", is an English-language version of a sketch from the team's first German episode. The production, with its innovative use of stereo and sound effects, was handled by Terry Jones and Michael Palin and proved a technical challenge. According to Jones: \\"We had this horrendous time because we were recording in this rather hippy recording studio. We were very keen to use the stereo and everything, but what we hadn't realised was that the guy who was doing the recording, who I think was out of his head most of the time, had not been making any notes.

Included with the original vinyl LP were three card inserts printed with detailed instructions, scripts and cut-out props for the \\"Be A Great Actor\\" sketch on side 2. Due to the limitations of the vinyl format, the original 1971 UK release had many sketches edited down while others, such as \\"Communist Quiz\\" and \\"Penguin On The TV\\", were omitted altogether causing a re-sequencing of the \\"Royal Festival Hall Concert\\" and \\"Spam\\" sketches. This truncated version was used for all UK cassette releases until 1994. When the album was released in the US in 1972 to coincide with the US release of And Now For Something Completely Different, the full unedited version was used. This longer edit was used for all CD releases in both the UK and US. As well as featuring a pared down track list, the original UK vinyl enjoyed two subtly different releases. Initial pressings were issued on the pink \\"famous Charisma label\\" (erroneously listing the release year as 1970) with subsequent pressings replacing this with the \\"Mad Hatter\\" label design (correcting the year to 1971). Both editions featured a trick continuous runout groove at the end of Side 1 where the sound of a record scratch is followed by Michael Palin's exclamation of \\"Sorry squire!

In 1890 the British erected a lighthouse at Kodiakkarai (‡Æï‡Øã‡Æü‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Øà) which is still in use near the remains of the old Chola lighthouse. Before 1968 AD Ptolemy referred to Point Calimere as Calligicum prom.. Compendium of Ancient Geography, By Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d' Anville, John Horsley, Published by R. M'Dernaut and D.D. Arden, 1814 Item notes: v. 2, p. 277 Original from the New York Public Library, Digitized 27 April 2007 Use of the term Point Calimere appears to date back at least to between the early 16th century, when Portuguese traders started commercial contacts with nearby Nagapattinam town, and 1554 when they established a commercial center there. In the Portuguese language calido means warm and mar means sea.Wikipedia Nagapattinam History Before 1892 the forests around Point Calimere were administered by the Revenue Department and Temple trustees who allowed local people to collect firewood, fish and minor forest products. Forest management practices in the area began in 1892 with creation of the Kodaikadu Reserved Forest. A small area near the Sanyasin Muniaswar Temple was used by the British as a hunting ground and later cleared and replanted with casuarina and eucalyptus for firewood production. Some of these old trees remain. Palmyrah trees were planted to mark the village forests from the Reserved Forest near Munniappan Lake. There is a shrine to the deities Shevrayan and Soni located deep in the forests of the northern part of the sanctuary. A small village near Shevrayan Kovil shrine was relocated outside the sanctuary after the creation of Kodaikarai Reserve Forest. A few uncommon Indian tulip and neem trees from this old settlement still remain. In the early 1900s small numbers of ponies were bred and large amounts of tobacco were grown in the neighbourhood. The promontory was once used as a sanitarium, but by 1909 was said to be malarious from April to June. Bathing in the sea at Point Calimere was considered sacred by Hindus and a temple there was an object of pilgrimage.http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V09_297.gif Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 9, p. 291. In 1911 The reserve forest was under the control of the Trichy-cum-Thanjavor Forest Division. In 1922 the reserved forest was put under the control of the Revenue Divisional Officer, Mannargudi by the Governor of Madras. In 1938, Kodaikarai Extension No. 1 , Kodaikarai Estension No. 214.75 and Kodaikarai Estension No. 3 were added to form the present area of the sanctuary. In 1950 control of the forest was shifted to the Tiruchirapalli Forest Division, in 1957 to the Thanjavur Division and in 1965 to the State Wildlife officer in Chennai. In 1962 Dr. Salim Ali first identified The Point Calimere region as an area of high significance for the conservation of birds. In 1967 the sanctuary was created and put under control of the Thanjavar Forest Division and then to the Wildlife Division in Nagapattinam when that was created in 1986. In 1936 a rail line was extended to Kodaikorai for transport of salt from Vedaranyam. Train service was halted in 1988 and the tracks were dismantled in 1995. During World War II a radar station was constructed and operated by Army personnel who had unquestioned access to the forests. In 1943 an experimental Casurina plantation was begun and soon extended by destruction of most of the natural forest. This resulted in a major decrease in numbers and variety of wild animals in the area. Water transport to PCWBS by bullock cart In the early years of the Sanctuary management was concentrated on prevention of poaching and provision of water to the wildlife. Poaching has been controlled but water supply is a continuing effort. In 1979 the first of several water troughs supplied from water barrels transported by bullock cart and open wells were built. Beginning in 2001‚Äì02 several perennial water holes supplied by pipe from bore wells and a large elevated water tank on the western edge of the sanctuary were built. Several tree planting schemes to increase biodiversity have yielded poor results, with the exception of Casuarina equisetifolia. Current practice is to avoid new tree planting and concentrate on removal of the invasive Prosopis juliflora. An annual wildlife census has been conducted since 1991. The Bombay Natural History Society has been conducting regular bird migration studies in the sanctuary since 1959. In 2007 it is building a new field station in Kodaikadu. On 9 March 1998 a modern lighthouse near Kodaikorai Beach was commissioned. In 1999 many speed breakers were installed on the Vedaranyam ‚Äì Kodaikorai road which have effectively prevented the killing of wildlife by speeding vehicles. In 2004/05 nearly 100 boundary pillars were erected for boundary demarcation. On 26 December 2004 a tsunami as high as 3 metres (10 ft) hit the Kodiyakarai coast of the sanctuary. Seawater flooded the entire sanctuary with four feet of water. The sanctuary escaped serious damage and the sanctuary, animals and birds largely survived the giant wave, but 5,525 people were killed in neighbouring parts of Nagapattinam District. The documentary film Point Calimere ‚Äì Little Kingdom by the Coast by Shekar Dattatri won the Centre for Media Studies (CMS) Vatavaran 2007 award in the Nature category.Nature: Point Calimere ‚Äì Little Kingdom by the Coast Cultural heritage Several sites of religious, historical or cultural importance are located within the sanctuary: Ramar Padam shrine containing the footprints of Lord Rama in stone * Ramar Padam (literally: Ramas Footprint) located on the highest point of land in the sanctuary, is a small shrine containing the stone footprints of Lord Rama. Large numbers of Rama devotees gather here during the second week of April to celebrate Ram Navami Festival. *Kuzhagar Temple or Kodi Kuzhagar Temple (‡Æï‡Øã‡Æü‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ¥‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æï‡Øã‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç):ta:‡Æï‡Øã‡Æü‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Øà ‡ÆÖ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Æï‡Æü‡Øá‡Æö‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æï‡Øã‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç (also called Amrithakadeswarar Temple) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva, located in the town of Kodikkarai in Tamil Nadu, India. Kuzhagar is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. Kuzhagar temple is originally believed to have been built by the Cholas and it has several inscriptions dating back to the Chola period. * Navakodi Sitthar Aalayam is a temple in south of the Kodiakkarai village. The history of this temple is the wedding ceremony of Lord Shiva and Parvathy ammaal have been attended by lot many Sitthars at this location. Chola Emperor and Mannar Sarafoji were visited this temple. A small village called \\"Kanakkar Madam\\" near this shrine was demolished around 80 years ago and the people who were living there are relocated to Kodiakkarai village and they are still called as Kanakkarmadathiaar's family. A large congregation of devotees from all over Tamil Nadu state to come on special day of Amaavasai/Pournami to celebrate a special festival here every year. The greatest lord and the environment gives the peace like never ever feel. * Sanyasin Muniaswar Kovil is a shrine between the eastern bank of Muniappan Lake and Kodaikarai Road visited by devotees on all auspicious occasions. On 20 March a special Puja is celebrated here. * Mattumunian Kovil is a small temple in the south of the sanctuary where people worship and offer prayers throughout the year. A major festival occurs here on the 3rd Friday of September. * Modi Mandapam is a shrine located near Ramar Padam where people of all castes worship. Hindu legend says that Lord Vedaraneswarer spends a night here with his consort during January ‚Äì February. In the first week of March a major festival is held here. * Avulaiganni Dargah is the grave of a Muslim saint located near the road by Ramar Padam. His death anniversary is observed here at the end of November. * Shevrayan Kovil is a shrine to the deities Shevrayan and Soni located deep in the forests of the northern part of the sanctuary. A small village near this shrine was relocated outside the sanctuary after the creation of Kodaikarai Reserve Forest. A large congregation of devotees from Arcothurai celebrate a special festival here in June/July. Adivasi Colony * Adivasi Colony is a backwards community of Ambalakars living in ramshackle huts of mud, coconut fronds and palmyrah leaves on the edge of Kodaikarai village. Their traditional livelihood was the collection of non-timber forest products in the areas that are now the sanctuary. These practices are now prohibited but not fully eliminated. Many of these people catch fish and small prawns in the nearby mudflats and swamps simply by groping in the water with their hands. Some work as day labour in the nearby salt pans. They have little interaction with other communities on the island. Kodaikarai Lighthouse near Kodaikorai Beach * Chola Lighthouse is the remains of a brick and mortar lighthouse near Point Calimere said to have been built by the Cholas more than a thousand years ago. This structure was badly damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami but can still be seen in the intertidal zone near the British lighthouse. * British Lighthouse is a tall operating lighthouse built by the British at the tip of Point Calemere in 1890 and can be seen at sea. * Kodaikarai Lighthouse is a tall modern aid to navigation located near Kodaikorai Beach and is not accessible to the public. This dominates the sanctuary and may be seen by seamen far at sea. Geography Aerial view of Point Calimere Map of the sanctuary The sanctuary, located adjacent to and east of Kodaikarai and Kodaikadu villages, is basically an Island surrounded by the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Palk Straight to the south and swampy backwaters and salt pans to the west and north. Coordinates are between 10.276 and 10.826 N and 79.399 to 79.884 E. Low sand dunes are located along the coast and along the western periphery with coastal plains, tidal mud-flats and shallow seasonal ponds in between. Sand dunes in the east are mostly now stabilised by Prosopis and the higher dunes in the west are stabilised by dense Tropical dry evergreen forests. The tallest dune in the sanctuary and the highest point of land in Nagapattinam District is . at the northwest corner of the sanctuary at Ramar Padam. PCWBS forms the easternmost and most biologically diverse part of Ramsar Site no. 1210 which, on 19 August 2002, was declared a place of international importance for the conservation of waterbirds and their wetlands habitats. This site comprises PCWBS, Panchanadikulam Wetland, Unsurveyed Salt swamp, Thalainayar Reserved Forest and Muthupet Mangroves. It is all part of the Great Vedaranyam Swamp, except the reserved forest. Fauna This sanctuary is an area of high biodiversity, with many unique species of animals and birds. See photos blackbuck at point calimere sanctuary ;Land animals PCWBS is inhabited by fourteen mammal species, eighteen reptile species and nine amphibian species. Blackbuck antelope, PCWBS's flagship species The flagship species of the sanctuary is the near threatened blackbuck antelope, one of the four antelope species in India (Chinkara, Chausingha and Nilgai being the other three) and the most numerous large animal in the sanctuary. The population estimate of the blackbuck at Point Calimere more than doubled in thirty years, from 750‚Äì800 in 1967 to 1,908 in 1998/99. This isolated population of blackbuck probably survived unmolested throughout the centuries due to the locals' now declining belief that eating its meat causes leprosy. The predators of the blackbuck at Point Calimere are jackals, and sometimes village dogs. Competition for food is from domestic and feral cattle. Other notable animals include: spotted deer, jackal, bonnet monkey, wild boar, monitor lizard, short-nosed fruit bat, small Indian civet, star tortoise, Indian grey mongoose, black-naped hare, jungle cat and feral pony. ;Marine animals Bottlenose dolphin is frequently seen along the shore of the sanctuary in morning and evening hours during the winter. The shoreline beaches of the sanctuary are a regular nesting site of the endangered olive ridley turtle. In 2002 a pair of Bryde's whale were found washed ashore near the sanctuary. One 10 ton 35-foot whale was successfully towed back to sea. Flight of painted stork at PCWBS List of birds at PCWBS This was the first successful rescue of a beached whale in Asia. ;Waterbirds This site has recorded the second largest congregation of migratory waterbirds in India, with a peak population in excess of 100,000, representing 103 species. Bombay Natural History Society researchers have captured, studied, ringed and released over 200,000 birds during the course of several ornithological studies here in the past several years. In October these waterbirds arrive from Rann of Kutch, Eastern Siberia, Northern Russia, Central Asia and parts of Europe for their feeding season and start returning to those breeding places in January. These waterbirds include threatened species such as spot-billed pelican, Nordmann's greenshank, spoonbill sandpiper and black-necked stork. Near threatened species include black-headed ibis, Asian dowitcher, lesser flamingo, spoonbill, darter and painted stork. ;Landbirds Brahminy kites and slender billed gulls at PCWBS Over of the best tropical dry evergreen forest in India are in the sanctuary. They harbour a large variety of resident and migratory landbirds. The most common of the 35 resident species are white-browed bulbul, brahminy kite, small green-billed malkoha, crow pheasant, rose-ringed parakeet, grey partridge, blue-tailed bee-eater and common iora. Spotted and collared doves are common in the mangroves. Flora Mangrove forest at Muthupet This site is a mix of salt swamps, mangroves, backwaters, mudflats, grasslands and tropical dry evergreen forests. 364 of flowering plant species have been identified in the sanctuary of which 50% are herbs and the others are climbers, shrubs and trees. About 198 of these have medicinal properties. Manilkara hexandra, locally called Palai is the dominant dry evergreen species and an important food source for fruit eating birds. Middle canopy is dominated by the invasive Prosopis juliflora and the most abundant undergrowth is Memecylon umbellatum. Threats Salt Pans west of PCWBS Major threats to the natural biodiversity and ecological balance of the sanctuary are: loss of habitat for waterbirds, soil and water salinisation by adjacent salt pans, spread of the invasive Prosopis juliflora, cattle grazing and scarcity of fresh water. Sanctuary staff conduct programs to alleviate all these issues. Visitor information Tower at Ramar Padam Tower at sanctuary center Tower near Muniappan Lake The sanctuary is open all year from 6 am to 5 pm. The best weather at the sanctuary is during November and December when the area is cooled by the Northeast monsoon and the grasslands are the most luxuriant. The best time for bird watching is from October to January and the best time for animal viewing is from March to August. The sanctuary entrance and police checkpoint is located south of Vedaranyam, south of Nagapattinam and south of Chennai. A paved road leads from the checkpoint to the villages of Kodaikadu and Kodaikarai. Vehicles are prohibited in the core of the sanctuary. Forest Department guides are available, with prior request to the Wildlife Warden, to escort visitors for bird and wildlife watching in the core of the sanctuary. There are several watchtowers accessible to the public that provide panoramic views of the sanctuary. They are located at: * Ramar Padam, a popular pilgrimage destination. The watchtower here is near the road at the northwest corner of the sanctuary just inside the entrance at Ramam Padam. * in the center of the sanctuary that may be reached with the aid of a guide. * at the eastern end of the sanctuary that may be reached with the aid of a guide. * in the birding area is a rickety steel tower about west of the road near Muniappan Lake. * at the constables post on Kodaikarai beach at the end of the road near the southwest corner of the sanctuary is a tall damaged watchtower that requires a police escort to climb. It is not in the sanctuary, but provides a good view of it. The nearest railway station is Nagapattnam () and nearest airport is Tiruchirapalli (). Lodging and restaurants are available at Vedaranyam. Lodging near the sanctuary is available at the Forest Department Rest House named Flamingo House (Poonarai illam), in Kodaikarai, with prior approval of the Wildlife Warden, District Forest Office,District Collectorate Campus, Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu: 611003, Tel: 04365-253092, Email: wlwngp@gmail.com  See also  * Point Calimere * Kodi Kuzhagar temple * List of birds of South India References Category:East Deccan dry evergreen forests Category:Wildlife sanctuaries in Tamil Nadu Category:Ramsar sites in India Category:Mangroves ","title":"Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary"},{"id":"1252966","text":"Sofia Elizabeth Mantega, also known as Renascence and formerly known as Wind Dancer, is a fictional character, a former mutant appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics.

While under the care of her uncle, Sofia's mother is killed in a riot. Her only Venezuelan adult relative, an uncle, is unable to support her in addition to his own children, so she is sent to her father, who had been previously unaware of her existence. The head of a major supermarket chain located in the United States, Walter Barrett is a cold, asocial man with no interest in a daughter. As such, he extracts from her a promise that she would learn English before school started, she would get good grades, and she would not use her mutant power, in exchange for which all her material wants would be provided for without question. Over the next three weeks, she befriends her father's manservant Derek, learns English, and joins a local school, but despite her outgoing nature, she has difficulty fitting in and is unable to reconcile herself to her father's lack of affection for her. She ultimately acts out by skipping school and wrecking one of her father's stores with hurricane-force winds, making sure her actions are caught on a store security camera. Her father is incensed, less at the destruction of his store than by her exposing him as the father of a mutant, and considers leaving her in prison for 48 hours to punish her.

Prodigy rejects the offer to lead the New Mutants, so the position falls to Sofia. She becomes isolated and irritable when the group loses their first training exercise, which she blames on her failure to lead. Her command decisions weaken further when Wither is arrested for the accidental death of his father, and she briefly sides with the Hellions, Julian's squad, to break him free. After the New Mutants fight the Hellions over the incident, Prodigy talks her into letting Wither go, and she tries to convince him to lead the New Mutants. He insists that Sof√≠a's emotionalism has its advantage in a leadership role, but agrees to be co-leader, to better mesh their strengths.New X-Men: Academy X #6 (December 2004) Thereafter, Sofia's temper eases again until the school dance, where she catches Laurie manipulating Prodigy to make her ex-boyfriend Elixir jealous.New X-Men: Academy X #14 Alarmed by the rapid disintegration of the squad, she finds herself kissing Julian, and he pushes her to end the in-fighting since she is the one who sees the good in everyone - even him.

She feels directionless in her new \\"normal\\" life and has nightmares about losing her powers. During the dream, Sofia enjoyed the pleasures of winged flight. Around this time, Sofia begins to receive strange messages from a group calling itself the New Warriors. The group sends a messenger whom Sofia recognizes as Barry, a young man she knew (and flirted with) from the restaurant she works in. Barry explains that he is a depowered mutant, and is actually her old friend from the Xavier Institute, Beak, whom she did not recognize because of his altered appearance post-M-Day. Beak transports Sofia into the secret base of the New Warriors,New Warriors v.4 #1 but she rejects their efforts to talk her into joining the group.New Warriors v.4 #2 However, a battle between the New Warriors and a new Zodiac breaks out near the restaurant where Sofia works and she witnesses Cancer kill the New Warrior Longstrike.New Warriors v.4 #4 With the Warriors fighting a losing battle and a little boy caught in the crossfire, Sofia charges towards Cancer, providing enough distraction to give her friends the upper hand. While the superpowered individuals battle, Sofia tries to get the young boy to safety but is blasted from behind. At the hospital, doctors determine Sofia is suffering from burns, a concussion, and various other problems from the attack. During a comatose state, Sofia dreams she is meeting her mother in Heaven and once again bears angel-like wings. Sofia makes headlines for her heroic deeds during the battle.

She has also used her powers to create a \\"cutting\\" effect by refining the force of the wind.New Mutants vol. 2 #5 (November 2003) When at close range, she can also compress air into a person's ear to disrupt their middle ear's equilibrium thereby disturbing their balance.New Mutants vol. 2 #3 (September 2003) As Renascence, she wears a suit equipped with six metal cybernetic tentacles that can discharge surges of electricity from its claws. She is also equipped with a personal force field that emits a golden aura. Sofia has some athletic and martial arts skills due to her training as a New Mutant at Xavier's and the combat sessions with the New Warriors. Other versions =House of M= Wind Dancer is a S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee in the House of M reality. During the House of M crossover (which later led to Decimation), Wind Dancer was shown as a S.H.I.E.L.D trainee, in the Hellions Squad, under Dani Moonstar's supervision, and involved in a rather intimate relationship with Scion (Julian's counterpart). In this reality, she battled control against Wallflower's pheromones that manipulated the New Mutant Leadership Institute's students into fighting with the S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees to the death. After Wallflower was killed and her influence severed, the surviving young mutants teamed up to attack Emperor Sunfire, who headed Project: Genesis, a plan to mutate baseline humans. Sunfire ordered their death, but reality was reverted before anything further happened.

As Laurie had no control over her powers and unwillingly caused people to mirror her own emotions, this knowledge scared her, and she became even more withdrawn than before.New Mutants vol. 2 #11 (June 2004) After the Xavier Institute becomes public, Gail sends her there, and moves to Salem Center to stay near her, so that she could have one person whose reactions she could trust. Although she insists that Laurie live at the school, so that she could make friends, Laurie remains a loner and goes through several roommates in quick succession. Eventually Sofia Mantega is paired with Laurie and, with her power to blow pheromones away, Laurie no longer has to worry about accidentally manipulating her roommate.New Mutants vol. 2 #2 (August 2003) Under pressure from Sofia, she also begins developing acquaintances with David Alleyne and Kevin Ford. On a visit to meet Sofia's former butler, they are attacked by the Reavers, and Laurie is stabbed through the heart.New Mutants vol. 2 #5 (November 2003) She is saved by Josh Foley, who uses his power to heal her.New Mutants, vol. 2 #6 (December 2003) Laurie develops an immediate crush on Josh, but before she can pursue it, he falls head-over-heels for Rahne Sinclair.New Mutants vol. 2 #9 (February 2004) Laurie nonetheless remains smitten with Josh, and the sight of him in mortal danger gives her the emotional fortitude to take conscious control of her powers.New Mutants, vol. 2 #11 (June 2004) After the mansion is destroyed and rebuilt, she is placed on the official New Mutants squad with Josh, Sofia, David, Surge and Kevin and given the codename Wallflower.New X-Men: Academy X #2 (August 2004) When Rahne breaks up with Josh, saying that a relationship with him is inappropriate since she is on the faculty, he begins dating Laurie in order to make Rahne jealous.New X-Men: Academy X #3-6 Eventually Rahne, feeling it would be healthier for Josh to be with Laurie after she sees the two returning from a date, breaks off her relationship with Josh for good. Kevin spies on their conversation and uses the information to break Josh and Laurie up. Laurie is left embittered by the experience, going so far as to use her pheromones to manipulate Prodigy into kissing her at the dance in a successful attempt to make Josh jealous. Sofia realizes what is happening, and the event adds to the fast disintegration of the squad. thumb Thereafter, Sofia pushes all the New Mutants into a camp out for one night on the Xavier Institute grounds. While the initial attempts by Sofia at forcing a resolution come to disaster, a fist-fight between Josh and David leads Laurie to confess to Josh what had happened at the dance. Later she - along with the other New Mutants - overhear him pouring his heart out to Icarus, leading her to forgive him enough to be friends. After the events of House of M, where almost the entire mutant population lost their powers, Laurie was one of the few who retained the mutant gene. Panic spread throughout school in the aftermath of the Decimation and, assuming he'd lost his powers too, Kevin reaches out to Laurie, withering away her arm.New X-Men #20 (2006) Shortly after this trauma, Laurie is shot and killed by a sniper working for the Reverend William Stryker.New X-Men #25 (2006) It is later revealed that Stryker had her killed because a vision from the future foretold she would be the one to single-handedly defeat his army. A long time later, a maniacal scientist uses Laurie's exhumed genetic material (as well as the genetic material of the X-Men's numerous allies and foes) to create Bio-Sentinel weapons housed within cloned bodies.Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 #31-35 (2010) Powers and abilities Wallflower can control emotions through the use of emitted pheromones. Initially she could not control when she released them, and could only match the emotion she felt. Before her death, in her time at Xavier's, she learned to control her powers and could keep her pheromones in check, emit them on command, and could induce a variety of emotional and physical responses, including fear, anger, lust, calmness, happiness and sleep. It was debated by staff writers and X-Men within the comic that if she gained full control of her powers she could apply them to crowd control or putting entire armies to sleep. Other versions =House of M= When the Scarlet Witch changed reality so that mutants were the dominant species, Laurie was a student at the New Mutant Leadership Institute. As Sofia belonged to the Hellions S.H.I.E.L.D training squad, the girls did not have a close friendship, Sofia even stating that she hated Laurie for being a \\"daddy's girl.\\" Laurie was closer to her father and estranged with her human mother in this reality, as well as being close friends with Mercury, her roommate. Both she and her father were deep cover agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and when Quentin Quire read her mind and discovered the truth she used her pheromone powers to make him suicidal and had him kill himself with his own powers. The New Mutants and Hellions team up to find Surge's father, a wanted terrorist. When the human terrorists reveal the despicable nature of \\"Project Genesis\\" to the shocked New Mutants and Hellions, Laurie reveals her true nature and causes the groups to fight one another to the death, claiming that she does not care about the illegal human experimentation, only about finding and bringing in the human terrorists. Mercury, the only one immune to her powers, pleads with Laurie, as a friend, to stop. Laurie refuses, revealing that she always hated Cessily because she could not manipulate her with her pheromones. Given no other choice, Mercury stabs her through the chest, killing her and ending the fight.

The character is depicted as a mutant, one of the student body in the Xavier Institute, and a member of the former New Mutants squad therein. She maintained her powers post M-Day and was the leader of the New X-Men. Publication history Surge was created by Nunzio DeFilippis, Christina Weir, Keron Grant and first appeared in New Mutants, vol. 2 #8 (January 2004). Fictional character biography Noriko Ashida was born in Japan. She was close to her brother, Keitaro, but she ran away from home after her powers manifested when she was thirteen years old; she claimed that her father \\"doesn't believe in mutants.\\" How she came to the United States is unknown, but she ended up homeless on the streets of Salem Center, reduced to buying illegal drugs using stolen money. With no training or practice in the use of her powers, Noriko's body would automatically absorb all nearby electricity and, once fully charged, release it in a storm of electrical bolts. In addition, her acceleration ability would force her to speak so quickly that no one could understand her. Though she found no treatment for most of these problems, the drugs would sedate her body enough that she could control her outbursts of electrical power. Keeping herself regularly supplied proved impossible, however, and during a robbery Noriko accidentally hits the young owner of a coffee shop with an electric bolt. A group of young mutants find her and bring her back to the X-Mansion. There, Beast designs gauntlets that regulate her absorption of ambient electricity and discharge as required to prevent further mental overloads.New Mutants, vol. 2 #8-10 (January - May 2004) Nori becomes a student of the Xavier Institute and, when the school adopts a squad system, is assigned to the New Mutants squad led by Danielle Moonstar. She is forced to share a room with Dust; the two young women disagree upon the role of women and the Muslim traditions that Dust follows.New X-Men: Academy X #2 (August 2004) Though initially hostile to the mutants who took her off the street - David Alleyne, Josh Foley, Sofia Mantega, and Laurie Collins - she soon comes to accept them as her friends.New Mutants, vol. 2 #12 (June 2004)New X-Men: Academy X #1 (July 2004) David asks Emma Frost to remove a mental block in his mind inhibiting him from recalling all the information and skills he has acquired. David sees a possible future in which he becomes the world's foremost genius, marries Noriko, and leads to her death. Disturbed, David begins to avoid her. Annoyed at such treatment, Nori ultimately confronts David, which leads to the two becoming an active couple.New X-Men: Academy X #10-11 Noriko retains her powers after the events of House of M. With only 27 students retaining their powers, Emma Frost orders the depowered students and staff, including Nori's advisor Danielle Moonstar, to leave the Institute. As it departs, one bus of depowered students is bombed by anti-mutant zealot Reverend William Stryker, killing all on board. Though depowered, David is not killed, and he and Nori further their romantic relationship.New X-Men #22 Most of the remaining students are organized into a melee fight to determine who would become a member of Emma Frost's X-Men-in-training. Nori is chosen by Frost to be the team's leader. Soon afterwards, Nori receives new, lighter, and more effective gauntlets from Forge. Caught in an argument over the rescue of Cessily, Surge and Hellion are the only students that are not teleported to Limbo. Trance uses her powers to get a message to the two, informing them that the Institute students had been taken into Limbo by Belasco, and that Belasco killed David. Coordinating with O*N*E*, Surge and Hellion discover that Amanda Sefton has been expelled from Limbo and is in a coma in Germany. Surge becomes impulsive and angry at David's death, threatening the O*N*E* troopers when they attempt to block her from seeing Sefton, using her electrical powers to revive the sorceress despite the risks.New X-Men #40 At the behest of Lexington, Megaton's pilot, Surge and Hellion stop fighting demons and head for the castle. Surge leads the united Xavier Institute students against the demonic hordes, engaging the twisted sorcerer in single combat before Belasco is killed by Pixie and Darkchild. The Institute is returned to Earth, at Santo's insistence. After their return from Limbo, Surge finds out from X-23 the torture David went through in Limbo. In hopes of driving him away from the school and out of harm's way, Surge kisses Hellion in front of David and the other students.New X-Men (vol. 2) #42 After confronting her of the incident, she insists that she doesn't love him anymore and pleads that he should leave the Institute. This backfires, as David regains his memories of the knowledge he once had and copied up until he lost his power with the help of the Stepford Cuckoos. David decides to both stay at the Institute and end their relationship.New X-Men (vol. 2) #43 Following the dissolution of the X-Men, Surge runs to Colorado, seeking help from Dani Moonstar. Nori is overwhelmed by the pain she has endured as a New X-Man and doesn't know how to cope. Nori realizes that her fear of being hurt has affected her judgment and driven her actions over the past months.X-Men: Divided We Stand #2 She later officially joins the X-Men based out of San Francisco: she is seen working on one the street crime patrols.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 2 #1 (2012) Surge is later kidnapped along with Boom Boom and Hellion by the Leper Queen and her Sapien League. The Leper Queen injects her with a modified version of the Legacy Virus.X-Force (vol. 3) #13 X-Force rescues their friends after completing their mission. Elixir is able to cure Surge before she could destroy the UN.X-Force (vol. 3) #16-18 We next see Surge defending the Golden Gate bridge during the 'Second Coming' event in which Bastion assaults the X-Men, who is in search for the 'Mutant Messiah' Hope Summers. Once again Nori is devastated when yet another teammate is injured during the initial Nimrod attack, destroying the hands of Hellion. Plunged into the waters of San Francisco Bay by Bastions last ditch attack, Nori witnesses Hope Summers emerge as the Mutant Messiah.X-Force (vol. 3) #27-28 Powers and abilities Surge absorbs electricity at all times: from static in the air, electrical appliances, outlets, etc. (often causing lights to flicker, etc.). She can't control the absorption, and thus must wear specially designed gauntlets at all times to regulate it. She can discharge the energy through powerful lightning-like blasts or channel it into bursts of superhuman speed. If she takes in too much energy, it causes mental overloads which cause her to speak too fast, scatters her thinking, and worsens her control over the blasts. Her blue hair is not related to her mutation. According to Nori, it came in a bottle labeled \\"electric blue\\" (and, indeed, she debuted with black hair). Personality Very forthright and strong- minded, Nori has often clashed with her peers and superiors, from nearly getting into a brawl with Hellion after he insulted Prodigy's baseline status post-M-Day,New X-Men #21 and challenging Cyclops' assertion that the students are safe at the Institute (this taking place immediately after a series of devastating attacks by the Purifiers).New X-Men #29 Nori also considers herself a feminist, attacking Dust's choice of garb as a betrayal of women's rights when the two are roomed together. Regardless, Nori is a loyal figure, dedicated to her friends, and increasingly feeling the responsibilities placed upon her as leader of the New X-Men. Surge was particularly incensed with Hellion's decision to rescue Mercury from the Faculty without backup, and has taken it upon herself to mold the team into an effective unit capable of defending the rest of the students. She's seen as having trouble welcoming X-23 back to the team after the latter's involvement in X-Force, possibly due to how the latter seemingly doesn't have to take responsibility for what she did as part of that team, in comparison to her own mounting responsibilities.X-23 #1 Chris Yost has stated that, \\"Surge is the right candidate, because she wants it the least. And you‚Äôll see, it‚Äôs taking a big toll on her. Being a leader when you‚Äôre doing team sports and field day exercises is one thing, but leading when the stakes are life and death is another thing.\\" Other versions =House of M= Nori is a member of Hellions in the House of M reality which is a group of junior agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Her father is a human terrorist whom she was taken away from at a young age. She was taken off the squad and replaced with Magik due to her father's involvement in their latest mission. She then recruits help from some of the students from the New Mutant Leadership Institute and they travel to Japan where they come across Project Genesis.New X-Men Academy X #15-17 (2005) In other media =Television= * Surge appears in Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers, voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi. In this version, her hair color is naturally blue, as evidenced by her eyebrows being the same shade. While she was briefly romantically attracted to Thor's partner, Hikaru Akatsuki, she later chooses to go to the Xavier Institute with Wolverine, after being offered protection by Magneto. =Video games= * Surge appears in the video game X-Men: Destinyhttp://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2011/01/11/x-men-destiny- details/ voiced by Aileen Ong Casas.

He was known to the Portuguese Navy as Quan Apon Chay during the Battle of the Tiger's Mouth. History =Early life= The Cheng family of the Pirates on the China Sea genealogy Cheung Po () was born in 1783, he was a son of a Tanka fisherman who lived in Xinhui of Jiangmen. =Piratical career= On about 1798, He was abducted at age 15 by the pirate Cheng I () who pressed him into piracy. His natural talent helped him adapt to his unplanned new career and he rose through the rank swiftly. Cheung Po Tsai was later adopted by Cheng I and Ching I Sao (); \\"wife of Cheng I\\"; married 1801) as their step- son, making him Cheng's legal heir. Cheung Po Tsai's piracy mate and lieutenant was Cai Qian () and the two worked together. Cai Qian had strong connections to the Western weapon dealers as his wife Lu Shi (), best known by her nickname Cai Qian Ma (), was fluent in English and was an expert in Western weaponry.https://kknews.cc/zh-sg/history/ovplepm.html =Rise to command= After Cheng I died suddenly in Vietnam on 16 November 1807, his widow Ching Shih acted quickly to solidify the partnership with her step-son Cheung Po Tsai. Their first success came when they were able to secure the loyalty of Cheng's relatives, who were leaders in the fleet. They became lovers within weeks. As Ching Shih's second-in-command, Cheung Po Tsai was active along the Guangdong coastal area during the Qing Dynasty. Their followers were said to have reached 50,000+ and his fleet said to have possessed 600 ships. The tide began to turn in 1809. The authorities managed to discover that Cai Qian was docked in the coastal town of Wuzhen, Zhejiang province. The new naval leaders, Wang Delu and Qiu Lianggong, blockaded him into the port and attacked. Their cannons sank Cai Qian's ship and killed him. =Battle of the Tiger's Mouth= In September and November 1809, Cheung Po Tsao pirate fleet suffered a series of defeats inflicted by the Portuguese Navy at the Battle of the Tiger's Mouth and there was no way they would be able to hold out forever. =Battle of Chek Lap Kok= On 20 April 1810 at Furongsha in Guangdong, Cheung Po Tsai formally delivered his fleet and weapons, which now numbered about 280 ships, 2,000 guns and over 25,000 men. The Portuguese claimed naught, while the governor of Guangdong accepted his surrender. =As Qing Naval Officer= Cheung and Ching accepted an amnesty offered by the Qing Dynasty government, ending their career and allowed to keep the loot.Andrea J. Buchanan, Miriam Peskowitz - 2007 - 279 page Cheung Po Tsai renamed back to his former name and was capitulated to the Qing Dynasty government and became a captain in the Qing's Guangdong navy, receiving the rank of navy colonel. He was given a command of a total of 30 ships, allowed to retain 30 private fleets, and an appointment in Penghu. He would spend the rest of his life helping the government to fight other pirates.„Äà‰πô„Äâ„ÄäÈùñÊµ∑Ê∞õË®ò„ÄãÂéüÊñáÊ®ôÈªûÂèäÁÆãË®ª Cheung Po and Ching Shih were later married with Governor Bailing as witness.

In 1813, Ching Shih gave birth to his son Cheung Yu Lin, she would later had a daughter who was born at an unknown date. Death After Cheung Po died at sea in 1822 at age 39, his widow moved the family to Macau and there she opened a gambling house and a brothel and also into salt trade. The descendants from his son Cheung Yu Lin are currently based in Macao, China. Legacy Cheung Po Tsai Cave, Cheung Chau. Several places in Hong Kong are linked to Cheung Po Tsai: * Cheung Po Tsai Cave, on Cheung Chau island. It is a small natural cave, said to be the place where he stored his prizes. In addition, there are also Cheung Po Tsai Caves at Lamma Island, Tap Mun, Sai Wan, Chung Hom Kok, Chek Chau, Siu Kau Yi Chau and Longxue Island, Guangzhou. * Cheung Po Tsai built several temples dedicated to the goddess Tin Hau and seafaring activities on Ma Wan, Cheung Chau, and Stanley.

Project A's time period is a composite of several in Hong Kong's history. * The 1994 Hong Kong action film Once Upon a Time in China V has Cheung Po Tsai as one of the main villains opposing the protagonist Wong Fei-Hung. As the movie apocryphally takes place shortly after the Boxer Rebellion, however (over seventy years after Cheung Po Tsai had historically lived), Cheung is depicted in that movie as an extremely old man. * The movie Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End depicts a pirate named Sao Feng as a member of the Brethren Court.

Operation Stagecoach West Scotland operates in west central and southwest Scotland, in an area bounded by Greenock and Braehead to the north, Hamilton to the east, Carlisle to the south and the Isle of Arran to the west. Frequent express services also reach Glasgow from throughout Ayrshire & the X74 from Dumfries. Stagecoach West Scotland operates under five different brands: *Stagecoach Western is the prevalent brand and is used for the vast majority of bus operations throughout the West Scotland region. Stagecoach Western branded vehicles wear the Stagecoach corporate livery of red, blue, orange and white. It is the principal trading name of Western Buses Ltd. *Stagecoach A1 Service, was a trading name of Western Buses Ltd, it was used for the trunk service between Ardrossan and Kilmarnock that came with the purchase of the A1 Service business, though this trading name occasionally overlaps the Stagecoach Western brand in the area previously served by the independent A1 Service. Vehicles under this brand wore a simple blue and cream livery. (As of June 2010 vehicles now carry Stagecoach corporate livery.) *Stagecoach in Glasgow is used for services within Glasgow and those from Glasgow to Cumbernauld. Initially not carried on any vehicles while the Magic Bus brand was used for services in the city, it is now commonplace on Glasgow-based buses. In addition, vehicles operating on the former AA Buses services in the Irvine area previously wore the historical AA green and cream livery, though to date there has never been a Stagecoach AA Buses brand. Buses wearing this livery carried simplistic 'Stagecoach' branding. The company also provide vehicles for Scottish Citylink express work, mainly on the Glasgow to Edinburgh corridor, and also for Megabus, mainly running from Aberdeen to London. Stagecoach West Scotland had faced sustained competition from the FirstGroup between Ardrossan and Kilmarnock since Stagecoach launched its network of Glasgow city services in the heart of First's Glasgow operating territory in 1997, though First withdrew from Ayrshire in October 2005 leaving Stagecoach the sole dominant operator once again. While minor competition existed for several years from T & E Docherty around Irvine, Stagecoach has since purchased the routes and vehicles used by that operator. Minor competition exists from Shuttle Buses between Irvine and Girdle Toll (including local operation around Kilmarnock and Irvine) along with competition in the Irvine area from Bennetts of Kilwinning, JAS Transport around the Ardrossan, West Kilbride and Largs areas and also McGill's Bus Services between Largs and Greenock. The company has depots in Brodick(Isle of Arran), Ardrossan, Kilmarnock, Ayr, Cumnock, Glasgow, Stranraer, Dumfries. At both the 2005 and 2006 UK Bus Awards, Stagecoach West Scotland took the top award of 'UK Bus Operator of the Year', having narrowly missed out on the prize in 2004. It also received the 'Best Large Fleet Operator' award at the industry ceremony for both years .  History  A Stagecoach Western Volvo B10M in Ardrossan wearing the corporate livery. Stagecoach arrived in the west of Scotland when it purchased Western Scottish Omnibuses Ltd of Kilmarnock for ¬£6m in July 1994. Western Scottish was, at that time, owned by its management and employees, who had purchased the company from the state-owned Scottish Bus Group in October 1991 on the breakup and privatisation of that concern. Stagecoach wasted no time in expanding its operations in the west of Scotland, and in October 1994 purchased the small Arran Transport business based in Brodick, on the Isle Of Arran. In January 1995 Western took over the operations of A1 Service of Ardrossan, bringing with it some 80 vehicles and operations in the towns of Ardrossan, Saltcoats, Stevenston and Kilwinning, together with the very busy and frequent Ardrossan to Kilmarnock service. Though for a time the former A1 Service operations were under the separate legal entity of Stagecoach (A1 Service) Ltd, that company has since been absorbed by Western Buses. Clyde Coast Coaches of Ardrossan, a previous competitor to Western Scottish in services around Kilmarnock, sold its bus operations to Western in 1995, adding services from Saltcoats to Largs and Beith to the Western portfolio. The last 'big' purchase Stagecoach Western has made to date was that of AA Buses - the bus operations of Dodd's Of Troon, in summer 1997. At the same time the bus operations of Shuttle Buses of Kilwinning were also absorbed (note Shuttle Buses have since restarted local bus operation, though mainly restricted to tendered services). This would add local bus operation around Irvine, Stewarton and Troon, and would consolidate the Stagecoach Western operation, securing it as the dominant operator in north Ayrshire, a role Western Scottish never succeeded in filling. Stagecoach operated in Glasgow as Magic Bus in the late 1980s using old London AEC Routemaster buses, though it sold the operation to Kelvin Central Buses in the early 1990s. After a stillborn attempt in 1995 to purchase KCB, Stagecoach settled for a 20% stake in competitor Strathclyde Buses who purchased KCB), the present Stagecoach Glasgow operations were launched in 1997, after Strathclyde Buses sold to FirstGroup, and offered fast, direct and frequent services from Glasgow City Centre to Easterhouse, Castlemilk, Pollok, Darnley, East Kilbride and Cumbernauld. The Pollok and Darnley routes were express services which made good use of the new M77 motorway in the area and used new low floor vehicles. However, due to First Glasgow's new operations in Stagecoach's key Ayrshire and Fife markets Stagecoach decided to scale down operations in the area. It acquired Arriva Scotland West's 49% stake in Paisley company Dart Buses. Dart took over operation of the Pollok and Darnley services, which were closer to its base in Paisley and more in fitting with the rest of its west of Glasgow motorway express services. Stagecoach supplied vehicles to operate the routes, which continued under the Stagecoach Glasgow livery and brand, while several Dart vehicles were repainted into the Stagecoach corporate livery. It is unclear as to when Stagecoach acquired the stake in Dart Buses and as such it is likely that the company operated the Stagecoach services while Arriva retained their stake. Dart Buses ran into financial trouble early in the new millennium and without notice suddenly ceased operations overnight. First capiltatised on the collapse of Dart Buses and registered the defunct company's motorway services before either Arriva or Stagecoach could, and as such Stagecoach decided not to re-start operations. The East Kilbride services were soon withdrawn, some regarding the timetabling of it as optimistic, and the remaining operations were rebranded as the \\"no- frills\\" Magic Bus with rock bottom fares and older vehicles. The Castlemilk operation was taken over by FirstGroup in June 2005 who until January 2006 kept the old Stagecoach service 175 running alongside its own 75 service. Vehicles in the Magic Bus operation wear a deep blue livery with bright yellow lettering, complete with slogans \\"It's magic!\\" and \\"It goes roon the toon!\\" (sic), the latter imitating the Glasgow dialect. Though the Ballieston service was withdrawn during summer 2006, the Easterhouse service is still operated, though now by Stagecoach in Glasgow branded vehicles, the Magic Bus brand having been dropped in the city. In July 2004, Stagecoach announced the acquisition of the M8 Motorvator Glasgow to Edinburgh express service from Lanarkshire firm, Longs Coaches. This pitched Stagecoach in fierce and direct competition from Scottish Citylink, a company Stagecoach ironically operated vehicles for under a franchise agreement. Stagecoach continued to use the distinctive M8 Motorvator brand on this route, with vehicles wearing a red and off-white livery, and was operated by Stagecoach Glasgow Ltd. Some seats on the Motorvator service were available for purchase through the low-cost Stagecoach subsidiary Megabus. Both companies offered fast, frequent and affordable express services along the M8 motorway corridor between the two Scottish cities, a situation that continued until 13 September 2005. On that date, Stagecoach and Citylink parent company ComfortDelGro announced a joint venture in the provision of express coach services in Scotland. Under the terms of the agreement, Stagecoach would take a 35% stake in Citylink in return for certain rights to the Megabus brand in Scotland. This ended competition between the two operators and the withdrawal of the Motorvator brand. Stagecoach has resumed operating vehicles for Citylink under a franchise agreement, and many vehicles that operated as Motorvator now wear Citylink livery. However this sale is being investigated by the office of fair trading. During 2006, Stagecoach introduced several new express services, including the short-lived X33 from Ayr to Paisley later extended to Braehead Shopping Centre, of which part of the route from Ayr to Paisley was originally operated by Western until the 1970s, albeit using a slightly different route. The X33 service was the first time the company had strayed into the heartlands of 'Clydeside' Another innovative new service is the X16 connecting Ayr with Hamilton and East Kilbride via Kilmarnock, although as of 2020, the X16 has been cut in half to serve between Ayr and Kilmarnock due to low passenger usage.

He created James Bond's lethal Aston Martin DB5, Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder, the Jedi Knights' lightsabers and the endearing robots R2-D2 and C-3PO, as well as a host of other famous movie gadgets and special effects. Life and family John Stears was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex (now part of Greater London), on 25 August 1934, and grew up in nearby Ickenham. Stears studied at Harrow College of Art and Southall Technical School before working as a draughtsman with the Air Ministry. He served as a dispatch rider during his National Service, then joined a firm of architects where he was able to utilise his passion for model-making by constructing scale models of building projects for clients. For most of his life he lived at Welders House in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, where he reared cattle and his wife ran the Livny Borzoi Kennels, breeding Borzoi show dogs. In 1993, he sold the estate in Buckinghamshire to the singer Ozzy Osbourne and emigrated to California with his wife Brenda, whom he married in 1960, the couple had two children. Film career Stears' Academy Award-winning adaptations made James Bond's DB5 Stears added his inventions to the first eight James Bond thrillers, won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1965 for Thunderball, and shared another Academy Award in 1977 for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. He created some of the most famous scenes in the movies. He blew up the villain's Jamaican hideout at the end of Dr. No (1962), and for Goldfinger (1964), he created Agent 007's Aston Martin DB5, featuring bullet-proof windows, revolving license plates, forward-firing machine guns, a rear oil-slick dispenser and a passenger-side ejector seat. He also created an avalanche for On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) and built flying cars for the musical film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) and the Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun (1974). Stears grew disenchanted with the Bond franchise, and vowed never to do another one. He complained that the \\"team spirit\\" had gone. Stears expressed great regret that Kevin McClory could not get his rival Bond film, Warhead, into production, as Stears wanted to work on that film. In 1976, Stears received a telephone call from George Lucas, who had been a great admirer of the Bond films, who wanted to know if he was interested in creating mechanical and electrical effects for a film that he had written, Star Wars. Stears accepted the offer. Stears had something in common with Alec Guinness and John Williams; he had won an Academy Award before working on Star Wars.. episodenothing. For Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), Stears created the robots R2-D2 and C-3PO, Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder, the Jedi Knights' lightsabers, and the Death Star. Stears was also credited, along with John Dykstra, for the original film's climactic aerial dogfight. Other well known mechanical effects Stears orchestrated included the garbage compacter, making an X-wing fighter fly and the Jawa's sandcrawler.. Man who built R2D2. In 1978, producer Harry Saltzman hired Stears to direct the \\"shrunken man\\" epic film The Micronauts. The troubled project had been in pre-production for many years and saw many directors come and go; ultimately the film never made it into production. Awards John Stears with his two Academy Awards and Saturn Award John Stears is notably one of only a few people to ever win an Academy Award for a James Bond film and one of only eight to win an Academy Award for a Star Wars film. *1965 - Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for Thunderball *1977 - Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope *1978 - Saturn Award for Best Special Effects for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope *1982 - Saturn Award for Best Special Effects (nomination) for Outland Selected filmography *Call Me Bwana (1963) *From Russia with Love (1963) *Goldfinger (1964) *Court Martial (TV series) (1965) *Thunderball (1965) *You Only Live Twice (1967) *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) *On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) *Toomorrow (1970) *The Pied Piper (1972) *Sitting Target (1972) *Ghost in the Noonday Sun (1973) *O Lucky Man!

She is variously billed as a soprano, mezzo- soprano or contralto. A native of Sydney, she originally studied voice while on a scholarship at the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music. She won the National Eisteddfod in Canberra, as well as a number of other singing competitions, such as the ¬£1000 Shell Aria, 1960. By this stage she had become one of the country's leading contraltos, often appearing on radio and television and with the Sydney and Queensland orchestras. Minton left Australia in 1961 to pursue her studies in London. The same year, she won the Kathleen Ferrier Prize for the best contralto at the International Vocal Competition 's-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands. Her first major part in England was as Maggie Dempster in the premiere of Nicholas Maw's One Man Show. She sang the role of Clotilde on the 1965 Decca recording of Bellini's Norma. Shortly thereafter, she became a regular member of the company of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, appearing in such roles as Lola in Cavalleria rusticana. She created the role of Thea in Tippett's The Knot Garden (1970) and appeared at the Cologne Opera from 1969 (d√©but as Sesto in La clemenza di Tito). She has since appeared with most of the major English orchestras and in opera houses throughout Europe and the United States. She has also appeared at Bayreuth (Brang√§ne in Tristan und Isolde) and the Salzburg Festival 1978 (Octavian). In 1973, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Octavian in Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier. She sang the role of Countess Geschwitz in Lulu in Paris in 1979. She has also made many concert appearances, notably with Sir Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

It was completed c.1966 and is considered a \\"lost\\" novel by fans of James Bond because it was actually commissioned by Glidrose Productions, the official publishers of James Bond. It was rejected for publication, however, missing the opportunity to become the first continuation James Bond novel. The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003¬Ω, a novel written by the pseudonymous R. D. Mascott, was later published in 1967 featuring James Bond's nephew; Colonel Sun written by Kingsley Amis under the pseudonym Robert Markham was published in 1968 as the first adult continuation novel following Ian Fleming's The Man with the Golden Gun (1965). History Geoffrey Jenkins was given a job in the Foreign Department of Kemsley Newspapers, an organisation owned by the London Sunday Times, by Viscount Kemsley. There he worked with Ian Fleming, who was the Foreign Manager of the department, and the two men became friends. In a letter to John Pearson in 1965 when he was researching his biography on Ian Fleming, The Life of Ian Fleming, Jenkins revealed that in the late 1950s he had discussed the idea of a James Bond novel set in South Africa with Fleming, and even written a synopsis of it, which Fleming had very much liked. Fleming had said he would come to South Africa to research the book, but he died before this happened. Pearson was understandably excited by this revelation, and even more so when he found Jenkins' Bond synopsis in Fleming's papers. At the same time, Glidrose were considering the idea of asking other authors to continue writing James Bond novels, a notion that Fleming's wife, Ann, was against, but his brother, Peter Fleming, who at the time was Glidrose's director, favoured. In November 1965, Jenkins met with Harry Saltzman, co-producer of the James Bond films between 1962 and 1974, and Charles Tyrell from Glidrose to discuss the possibility of his making his South African synopsis into the first James Bond \\"continuation\\" novel. Negotiations were protracted, but Jenkins was formally granted permission to write the book on May 12, 1966; a contract was drawn up on August 24, 1966, which stated that Jenkins would be entitled to a percentage of profits in any film made from the novel, but not from any related merchandise that might come about. Not much is known of the plot for Per Fine Ounce. The reference work The Bond Files by Andy Lane and Paul Simpson indicates that it was based upon a story Jenkins claimed he and Fleming had worked on around 1957, and that the storyline was set in South Africa and dealt with diamond smugglers and a spy ring and bore some resemblance to Fleming's Bond novel Diamonds Are Forever as well as his non- Bond work, The Diamond Smugglers. However, in an interview with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang magazine published in 2005, Peter Janson-Smith, Fleming's former literary agent and former chairman of Glidrose, claimed that he believed the story may have been about gold. This makes more sense, as the title derives from the line \\"per fine Troy ounce\\" or a variation of. A fine ounce is a Troy ounce of not quite pure gold. Jenkins' synopsis found by John Pearson in Fleming's papers featured gold bicycle chains, baobab tree coffins and the magical Lake Fundudzi--presumably, Jenkins used some or all of these elements in the book itself. Four draft pages of the manuscript were discovered in 2005, in which we learn that the Double-O Section has been closed down and James Bond defies M on a matter of principle, resigning from MI6 to pursue his mission in South Africa alone. Despite such promising-sounding material, and the fact that Jenkins was a best-selling thriller writer in the Fleming mould, had been a friend and colleague of Fleming's and had apparently had his blessing and input for the project, Glidrose rejected Jenkins' submitted manuscript. Peter Janson-Smith later recalled that he thought it was badly written, although he admitted that Glidrose may have been \\"stricter in those days.\\" A copy of the manuscript is rumoured to exist in the archives of Ian Fleming Publications (renamed from Glidrose in 1998); however, Peter Janson-Smith has said that he doesn't believe Ian Fleming Publications still holds a copy and that the most likely scenario is that the manuscript was returned for legal reasons (so as to not be sued in the future for plagiarism if a book with a similar plot is used). Jenkins' contract with Glidrose gave him a licence to reuse the material in the novel in the event of its rejection, with the proviso that he could not use any of Fleming's characters. Jenkins may have done this: his 1973 novel A Cleft Of Stars, while not containing any rogue British secret agents, is set in almost precisely the same area of South Africa, involves diamonds and gold, and has the hero temporarily hiding in a baobab tree. In 2005, Titan Books published a reprint of a comic strip based upon Colonel Sun. The introduction states that in the mid-1970s Amis lobbied for Eon Productions (producers of the Bond film franchise) to produce a film based upon his book. Reportedly he was told that Saltzman had forbidden that any film be made based on Colonel Sun due to Glidrose refusing to publish Per Fine Ounce a decade earlier. In 2010, previously unreleased extracts from the \\"lost\\" Jenkins manuscript Per Fine Ounce were released exclusively on James Bond website MI6.

Etymology The name Dactylioceras comes from the Greek dactyl, meaning ‚Äúfinger‚Äù, and refers to the shell's branching ribs. Description Dactylioceras are generally small, averaging in diameter. They have a strong, ribbed shell. The ribs are slightly inclined forward, running over the outer edge, and either simple or forking at outer end. Though they eventually died out 180 mya, their style of ribbing was copied by numerous subsequent ammonite genera until the whole group became extinct 66 million years ago with the dinosaurs. Ecology Dactylioceras probably lived by scavenging on the sea floor. Mass mortality specimens of Dactylioceras are common, and perhaps suggest that these ammonites may often have died shortly after spawning. The dead shells were probably gently washed up into a shell bank on the margins of the Lower Jurassic seas. Flow tank experiments show that Dactylioceras was probably a slow swimmer. Distribution Dactylioceras has been collected from almost every continent, and was one of the most successful ammonite lineages ever. They are abundant throughout Europe, with exceptionally fine specimens found in England and Germany. Like many other ammonites, the genus Dactylioceras is extremely important in biostratigraphy, being a key index fossil for identifying their region of the Jurassic.

Many of Mitropoulos's early interviews and program notes gave 18 February. In his later interviews, however, the conductor said he was born on 1 March, and most American sources also show this birthdate. The reason for the different dates is that Greece was still using the Julian calendar in 1896, and did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1923, when Mitropulos was 27. By then, the calendars were 13 days apart, but in 1896 they were only 12 days apart. The date 18 February 1896 under the Julian calendar corresponded to 1 March 1896 in the Gregorian. The earlier sources used the original Julian calendar date, and the later sources used the equivalent Gregorian date. ‚Äì 2 November 1960) was a Greek conductor, pianist, and composer. He received international fame both as a major conductor and composer of the 20th century.  Life and career  Mitropoulos was born in Athens, the son of Yannis and Angelikƒì Mitropoulos. His father owned a leather goods shop in downtown Athens. He was musically precocious, demonstrating his abilities at an early age. From the ages of eleven to fourteen, when Mitropoulos was in secondary school, he would host and preside over informal musical gatherings at his house every Saturday afternoon. His earliest acknowledged composition ‚Äì a sonata for violin and piano, now lost ‚Äì dates from this period. He studied music at the Athens Conservatoire as well as in Brussels and Berlin, with Ferruccio Busoni among his teachers. From 1921 to 1925 he assisted Erich Kleiber at the Berlin State Opera and then took a number of posts in Greece. At a 1930 concert with the Berlin Philharmonic, finding that his soloist was sick he played the solo part of Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 and conducted the orchestra from the keyboard, becoming one of the first to do so. = United States = Mitropoulos made his U.S. debut in 1936 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and he later settled in the country, becoming a citizen in 1946. From 1937 to 1949 he served as principal conductor of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (forerunner of today's Minnesota Orchestra). In 1949 Mitropoulos began his association with the New York Philharmonic, the peak of his orchestral career. He was initially co-conductor with Leopold Stokowski and became the sole music director in 1951. Mitropoulos recorded extensively with the Philharmonic for Columbia Records and sought to reach new audiences in the city through appearances on television and by conducting a week of performances at the Roxy Theatre, a popular movie theatre. Mitropoulos expanded the Philharmonic's repertoire, commissioning works by new composers and championing the symphonies of Gustav Mahler. In 1958, he was succeeded as the Philharmonic's conductor by a prot√©g√©, Leonard Bernstein. In January 1960, he guest conducted the Philharmonic in a performance of Mahler's Fifth Symphony, which was recorded. = Work in opera = In addition to his orchestral career, Mitropoulos was an equally important force in the operatic repertoire. He conducted opera extensively in Italy, and from 1954 until his death in 1960 was the principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, although the Met never had an official 'principal conductor' title until the 1970s. His musically incisive and dramatically vivid performances of Puccini, Verdi, Richard Strauss and others remain models of the opera conductor's art. The Met's extensive archive of recorded broadcasts preserves many of these fine performances. Mitropoulos's series of recordings for Columbia Records with the New York Philharmonic included a rare complete performance of Alban Berg's Wozzeck. Many of these have been reissued by Sony Classics on CD, including most recently his stereo recordings of excerpts from Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet. He recorded with the Minneapolis Symphony for RCA Victor during the 78-rpm era. He was also represented on the Cetra Records label, most notably with an early recording of Richard Strauss's Elektra. Mitropoulos premiered many contemporary works. Examples include the American premieres of Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony (1954) and First Violin Concerto (1956) and the world premieres of Barber's Vanessa (1958), Ernst Krenek's Fourth Symphony (1947), and John J. Becker's Short Symphony (1950). =Personal life= He was noted for having an Eidetic memory (which enabled him to conduct without a score, even during rehearsals) and for his monk-like life style due to his deeply religious, Greek Orthodox beliefs. Mitropoulos never married. He was \\"quietly known to be homosexual\\" and \\"felt no need for a cosmetic marriage\\". Among his relationships reportedly was one with Leonard Bernstein. He died in Milan, Italy at the age of 64 of heart failure, while rehearsing Gustav Mahler's 3rd Symphony. One of his very last recorded performances was Verdi's La forza del destino with Giuseppe Di Stefano, Antonietta Stella and Ettore Bastianini at Vienna on 23 September 1960. A recording exists of the performance of Mahler's 3rd Symphony given by Mitropoulos with the Cologne Radio Symphony on 31 October 1960, just two days before his death.  Impact on the music profession  Mitropoulos was noted as a champion of modern music, such as that by the members of the Second Viennese School. He wrote a number of pieces for orchestra and solo works for piano, and also arranged some of Johann Sebastian Bach's organ works for orchestra. In addition he was very influential in encouraging Leonard Bernstein's interest in conducting performances of Mahler's symphonic works. He also premiered and recorded a piano concerto of Ernst Krenek as soloist (available on CD), and works by composers in the U.S. such as Roger Sessions, Elie Siegmeister and Peter Mennin. In 1952 he commissioned American composer Philip Bezanson to write a piano concerto, which he premiered the following year. His compositions include a piano sonata and the opera S≈ìur B√©atrice (1918).  References  *Arfanis, Stathis A. The Complete Discography of Dimitri Mitropoulos.

He came from a simple background: his father was a labourer in the gardens at Hampton Court and he began as a joiner by trade. Working as a carpenter at Burlington House, he fell from a scaffold and broke his leg. While he was recuperating, the young Lord Burlington noticed his talent with the pencil, and by 1720 Flitcroft was Burlington's draughtsman and general architectural assistant, surveying at Westminster School for Burlington's dormitory, and superintending at the site at Tottenham House. Working life in the inner circle that was driving the new Palladian architecture was an education for Flitcroft. Flitcroft redrew for publication the drawings for The Designs of Mr. Inigo Jones, published by William Kent in 1727, under Burlington's patronage and supervision. In May 1726 Burlington got his prot√©g√© an appointment at the Office of Works, where he worked his way up from Master Carpenter and Master Mason to Comptroller of the King's Works, a prestigious position at the top of the architectural field. Royal commissions came his way in the form of some private projects for junior members of the British Royal Family; namely the Duke of Cumberland. His work for the Duke at Windsor Great Park included creating the Virginia Water Lake. Flitcroft's hands were constantly occupied with private commissions and, like most professional architects (and unlike virtuoso earls), he did some speculative construction in new-building London streets, supplied stone, and contracted to erect the buildings he was designing. Panelling and a mantelpiece from an old panelled room designed by Flitcroft in the 1720s from Potternewton Hall near Leeds were installed in Sutton Park in Yorkshire after 1935. From 1746 to 1756, he was Surveyor of the Fabric of St Paul's Cathedral. Monument at St Mary's church, Teddington He is buried at St Mary with St Alban, Teddington, together with his son.

Life Ratzel's father was the head of the household staff of the Grand Duke of Baden. Friedrich attended high school in Karlsruhe for six years before being apprenticed at age 15 to apothecaries. In 1863, he went to Rapperswil on the Lake of Zurich, Switzerland, where he began to study the classics. After a further year as an apothecary at Moers near Krefeld in the Ruhr area (1865‚Äì1866), he spent a short time at the high school in Karlsruhe and became a student of zoology at the universities of Heidelberg, Jena and Berlin, finishing in 1868. He studied zoology in 1869, publishing Sein und Werden der organischen Welt on Darwin. After the completion of his schooling, Ratzel began a period of travels that saw him transform from zoologist/biologist to geographer. He began field work in the Mediterranean, writing letters of his experiences. These letters led to a job as a traveling reporter for the K√∂lnische Zeitung (\\"Cologne Journal\\"), which provided him the means for further travel. Ratzel embarked on several expeditions, the lengthiest and most important being his 1874-1875 trip to North America, Cuba, and Mexico. This trip was a turning point in Ratzel's career. He studied the influence of people of German origin in America, especially in the Midwest, as well as other ethnic groups in North America. He produced a written account of his travels in 1876, St√§dte-und Kulturbilder aus Nordamerika (Profile of Cities and Cultures in North America), which would help establish the field of cultural geography. According to Ratzel, cities are the best place to study people because life is \\"blended, compressed, and accelerated\\" in cities, and they bring out the \\"greatest, best, most typical aspects of people\\". Ratzel had traveled to cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Richmond, Charleston, New Orleans, and San Francisco. Upon his return in 1875, Ratzel became a lecturer in geography at the Technical High School in Munich. In 1876, he was promoted to assistant professor, then rose to full professor in 1880. While at Munich, Ratzel produced several books and established his career as an academic. In 1886, he accepted an appointment at Leipzig University. His lectures were widely attended, notably by the influential American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple. Ratzel produced the foundations of human geography in his two-volume Anthropogeographie in 1882 and 1891. This work was misinterpreted by many of his students, creating a number of environmental determinists. He published his work on political geography, Politische Geographie, in 1897. It was in this work that Ratzel introduced concepts that contributed to Lebensraum and Social Darwinism. His three volume work The History of MankindThe History of Mankind by Professor Friedrich Ratzel, MacMillan and Co., Ltd., published 1896 was published in English in 1896 and contained over 1100 excellent engravings and remarkable chromolithography. Ratzel continued his work at Leipzig until his sudden death on August 9, 1904 in Ammerland, Germany. Ratzel, a scholar of versatile academic interest, was a staunch German. During the outbreak of Franco- Prussian war in 1870, he joined the Prussian army and was wounded twice during the war. Writings Influenced by thinkers including Darwin and zoologist Ernst Heinrich Haeckel, he published several papers. Among them is the essay Lebensraum (1901) concerning biogeography, creating a foundation for the uniquely German variant of geopolitics: Geopolitik. Ratzel's writings coincided with the growth of German industrialism after the Franco-Prussian war and the subsequent search for markets that brought it into competition with Britain. His writings served as welcome justification for imperial expansion. Influenced by the American geostrategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power. Ratzel's idea of Raum (space) would grow out of his organic state conception. His early concept of lebensraum was not political or economic but spiritual and racial nationalist expansion. The Raum-motiv is a historically-driving force, pushing peoples with great Kultur to naturally expand. Space, for Ratzel, was a vague concept, theoretically unbounded. Raum was defined as where German peoples live, and other weaker states could serve to support German peoples economically, and German culture could fertilize other cultures. However, it ought to be noted that Ratzel's concept of raum was not overtly aggressive, but he theorized simply as the natural expansion of strong states into areas controlled by weaker states. The book for which Ratzel is acknowledged all over the world is Anthropogeographie. It was completed between 1872 and 1899. The main focus of this monumental work is on the effects of different physical features and locations on the style and life of the people.

In many countries, the term is used as an administrative title. In some armed forces, commissaries are officials charged with overseeing the purchase and delivery of supplies, and they have powers of administrative and financial oversight. Then, the \\"commissariat\\" is the organization associated with the corps of commissaries. By extension, the term \\"commissary\\" came to be used for the building where supplies were disbursed. The equivalent terms are commissaire in French, commissario in Italian, Kommissar in Standard German, Kommiss√§r in Swiss German and Luxembourgish, comisario in Spanish, commissaris in Dutch and Flemish, komisario in Finnish, komisarz in Polish and comiss√°rio in Portuguese. Many of these words may also mean commissioner, depending on the context. Etymology The word is recorded in English since 1362, for \\"one to whom special duty is entrusted by a higher power\\". This Anglo-French word derives from Medieval Latin commissarius, from Latin commissus (pp. of committere) \\"entrusted\\". Examples =Government and administration= Governmental or administrative structures (or bodies) headed by a commissary (or composed of several commissaries) are often referred to as commissary governments or commissary administrations. Such terms were often used during the colonial era, and it was also used to designate various provisional governments of administrations. Executive or administrative body composed of several commissaries is often called Council of Commissaries or Board of Commissaries. Deputy of a commissary is styled as vice-commissary or sub-commissary. In the Soviet Union, commissaries' powers of oversight were used for political purposes. These commissaries are often known as commissars in English. =Military= British army With the establishment of an English standing army following the Restoration of the Monarchy a Commissary General of Musters was appointed on 20 December 1660. This officer, with the assistance of four deputies, was responsible for mustering troops by regiment and checking their names against the muster roll. These musters took place six or seven times per year (and monthly from 1687). At a muster the total number of officers and men was checked against the roll, each soldier's arms and accoutrements were inspected and each officer's rank (and record of leave) was checked against their level of pay. Only after the Commissary General had certified the muster roll would the Paymaster General of the forces issue pay to the regiment. In 1798 the commanding officer of each regiment, together with its regimental Paymaster, took over responsibility for the musters and the Deputy Commissaries were dismissed. The Commissary General continued to oversee a central office of musters until 1817 when the post was abolished and its duties transferred to the Secretary at War. The appointment of a Commissary General of Provisions was first made by James II in 1685 to provide for his troops encamped on Hounslow Heath. As a permanent post the appointment had lapsed by 1694, but a century later it was revived for senior officer of the Commissariat (a department of HM Treasury responsible for the procurement and issue of various stores and victuals to the army and the provision of transport). The Commissariat officers were uniformed civilians, appointed by the Treasury but issued with letters of commission by the War Office; they were given rank as follows: * Commissary General (equivalent to a Brigadier General) * Deputy Commissary General (equivalent to a Lieutenant Colonel or Major) * Assistant Commissary General (equivalent to a Captain) * Deputy Assistant Commissary General (equivalent to a Lieutenant) * Commissary Clerk (equivalent to an Ensign). The department was overseen by a Commissary-in- Chief from 1809-1816, and by a Commissary General in Chief from 1858 to 1869. Between 1793 and 1859 Assistant Commissary, Commissary and (from 1810) Chief Commissary were (civilian) ranks in the Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance (the field force element of the Ordnance storekeeping system). After 1869 Commissary and associated titles were used as junior officer ranks by the Control Department (military successor to both the Commissariat and the Ordnance Field Train). A split in 1875 created the Commissariat and Transport Department and the Ordnance Store Department, which used (respectively) Commissary-General and Commissary-General of Ordnance for their senior officers (along with other Commissary ranks down the chain of command). After 1880 officers of the new Army Service Corps were given full military rank, but the Army Ordnance Department retained Commissary of Ordnance (and Deputy and Assistant Commissary of Ordnance) as its junior officer ranks throughout the First World War.Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II =Ecclesiastical= Anglican Communion The Canons of the Church of England, referring to the metropolitical jurisdiction of archbishops and to the ordinary jurisdiction of diocesan bishops, states that: \\"Such jurisdiction is exercised by the (arch)bishop himself, or by a Vicar-General, official, or other commissary to whom authority in that behalf shall have been formally committed by the (arch)bishop concerned.\\". In previous centuries Bishops sometimes appointed representatives, called commissaries, to perform functions in distant portions of their dioceses. In 1684 Henry Compton, the Bishop of London, resolved to use the commissary system to provide leadership for churches in the American colonies., reprinted in 2014 (James Blair was an early such commissary). Commissaries were appointed to some, but not all, of the thirteen colonies into the second half of the eighteenth century. Later, commissaries were sometimes appointed for other parts of the British Empire. In 2011 the Archbishop of Canterbury appointed commissaries to conduct a visitation upon the Diocese of Chichester with regard to safeguarding failures in the diocese over many years. According to their interim report: \\"Our appointment by the Archbishop of Canterbury - the first such appointment of Commissaries for over 100 years - is evidence of the deep concern held in the Church of England for this diocese and its failure properly to protect children in its care\\".

Career Arnold began playing in the early 1920s as a sideline, when he was working as a farmhand in Buffalo, New York, and as a steelworker in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1929 he moved to Chicago and ran a bootlegging business, an activity he continued until the end of Prohibition. In 1930 he moved south briefly and made his first recordings, \\"Rainy Night Blues\\" and \\"Paddlin' Madeline Blues\\", under the name Gitfiddle Jim, for the Victor label in Memphis. He soon moved back to Chicago, where he was forced to make a living as a musician after Prohibition ended in 1933. Kansas Joe McCoy heard him and introduced him to Mayo Williams, a producer for Decca Records. From his first recording for Decca, on September 10, 1934, until his last, on May 12, 1938, Arnold made 88 sides, seven of which have been lost. Arnold, Peetie Wheatstraw and Bumble Bee Slim were well- known musicians in Chicago blues circles at that time. Wheatstraw and Arnold, in particular, were also major influences on their contemporary, the Delta blues artist Robert Johnson. Johnson turned \\"Old Original Kokomo Blues\\" into \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" and \\"Milk Cow Blues\\" into \\"Milkcow's Calf Blues\\". Another Arnold song, \\"Sagefield Woman Blues\\", introduced the phrase \\"dust my broom\\", which Johnson used as a song title. Other notable songs include his 1934 recording of \\"Sissy Man Blues\\", with lyrics referring to bisexuality (\\"Lord, if you can't send me no woman, please send me some sissy man\\").Doyle, JD (2004). \\"Sissy Man Blues\\".

It was later recorded by other blues musicians of the era, including Josh White (as \\"Pinewood Tom\\"), George Noble and Connie McLean's Rhythm Boys. In 1938 Arnold left the music industry and began to work in a Chicago factory. Located by blues researchers in 1962, he showed no interest in returning to music to take advantage of the resurgence of interest in the blues among young white audiences. His song \\"Milk Cow Blues\\" was recorded by Elvis Presley. Arnold died of a heart attack in Chicago in 1968, aged 67, and was buried in Burr Oak Cemetery, in Alsip, Illinois.

Among the highlights of Carter's stage performances during his career were the classic \\"sawing a woman in half\\" illusion (an elaborate surgical-themed version with \\"nurses\\" in attendance), making a live elephant disappear and \\"cheating the gallows\\", where a shrouded Carter would vanish, just as he dropped at the end of a hangman's noose. He was also known for devising acts that were inspired by recent events that captured the public's imagination, such as the discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb in 1922 or John Dillinger's famous jailbreak in 1934. In 1894 he met his future wife, Corrine, whom he married and included in his show. A year later, his son, Lawrence, who would eventually take over the act after his death, was born. Around the beginning of the century, Carter decided to settle down in Chicago along with his wife and son, his first major break from touring. During this time he tried to get a series of different business ventures up and running, such as an entertainment agency called The National Theatrical Exchange and his trade magazine called The Chicago Footlights, with various levels of success. During this time, he also enrolled in Law School, which he graduated from in 1905. In 1907 he set off again on a world tour that took him and his family to Australia, New Zealand, India, China, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Italy and beyond for three years. He would continue to tour the world with only short respites in the United States until 1917, completing seven world tours in this time. Because of his elaborate live shows, he had to travel everywhere with a lot of equipment, which at one point reached the weight of 31 tons. According to some sources, it was this heavy equipment of his that lead to him being refused a place on the RMS Titanic during a return trip to the US in 1912. Looking for a break from his world touring magic show, Carter purchased the famous Martinka Magic Palace in 1917. Despite plans of opening Martinka shops all over the country, Carter soon discovered that he was losing money in the magic shop business and sold the Martinka two years later to a group of investors that included Harry Houdini. A famous anecdote states that he kept his lion, Monty, in the back room of the shop and when it would roar, the startled customers would run for the door. In 1921, he lost a fortune while filming The Lion‚Äôs Bride in South Africa, a movie starring himself, that he had also written, produced, directed. The film never made it to screen. In 1936, Charles Joseph Carter suffered a heart attack on his way to Bombay, India. He was sent to the hospital and his son Larry took over the show. He died on February 13, 1936, aged 61 following a second heart attack. He is buried in the Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York. Legacy Carter's home in San Francisco was rented by the Sumitomo Bank of California in the 1980s-90s and used as a residence for the Bank's President. Carter used to put on shows in the basement and people still discover occult references in the stained glass windows. The house is in the Seacliff District of San Francisco near the Pacific Ocean. It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as the \\"Houdini Mansion\\". It is now used as a foreign consulate. Following Charles Carter's death from a heart attack in 1936, his son Larry Carter took over as Carter the Great. A variety of vintage posters, advertising his shows, are on display at the House on the Rock in Wisconsin. It is commonly believed that the character 'Maxwell' from the video game 'Don't Starve' was inspired by Carter because of his connections to magic and his relation to the city of San Francisco. A highly fictionalized account of his life can be found in Carter Beats the Devil () by Glen David Gold. The rights to the novel were purchased in 2002 by Paramount, with Tom Cruise planning to star and produce, but the film has since been stuck in production hell. Warner Bros. currently hold the rights to a Carter Beats the Devil film.

At club level, he won a Bundesliga title and three DFB-Pokal titles with 1. FC K√∂ln. At international level, he represented West Germany. Schumacher won the 1980 European Championship and lost two World Cup finals, in 1982 and 1986. In the 1982 FIFA World Cup semi-final, he controversially collided with and seriously injured French defender Patrick Battiston. Schumacher was voted German Footballer of the Year in 1984 and 1986. Since April 2012, he has served as vice president at 1. FC K√∂ln. Club career Schumacher made his first-team debut with 1. FC K√∂ln at the age of 19. He played for the club from 1972 to 1987, including in 213 consecutive Bundesliga matches from 1977 to 1983. For most of those years, until well into the mid-1980s, he was widely considered one of the world's top goalkeepers, and he was the automatic first-choice goalkeeper for his country. He backstopped K√∂ln to the double in 1978, winning the Bundesliga title (ahead of Borussia M√∂nchengladbach on goal difference) and the DFB-Pokal (defeated Fortuna D√ºsseldorf). The year before he had led K√∂ln to a DFB-Pokal victory (against Hertha BSC in the final), the club's first major trophy win in nine years. He appeared in two other DFB-Pokal finals, in 1980 (lost to Fortuna D√ºsseldorf) and 1983 (defeated Fortuna K√∂ln). Schumacher was voted German Footballer of the Year twice, in 1984 and 1986, by the nation's football journalists. International career Schumacher played 76 international matches for West Germany between 1979 and 1986, including 15 World Cup qualifying matches and 14 World Cup matches. He won the 1980 European Championship (defeated Belgium 2‚Äì1 in the final) and lost two World Cup finals, in 1982 (to Italy, 3‚Äì1) and 1986 (to Argentina, 3‚Äì2). In the 1982 tournament, in the controversial semi-final against France, he saved two penalty kicks in the post-extra time shootout, which West Germany ultimately won. In the 1986 quarter-final against tournament hosts, Mexico, he saved two of the three shootout penalties he faced, enabling West Germany to advance. =Controversy at 1982 World Cup= Schumacher was involved in a collision with a French defender, substitute Patrick Battiston, in the semi-final of the 1982 World Cup. Battiston and Schumacher were both sprinting towards a long through ball pass from Michel Platini. Battiston managed to reach the ball first and flicked it up and to the side of the approaching Schumacher. Schumacher leapt into the air as the ball sailed past him, ultimately wide of the goal. Schumacher, still in the air, collided with Battiston. The resulting contact left Battiston unconscious, later slipping into a coma. Schumacher has always denied any foul intention regarding the incident, saying that he was simply going for the ball, as a goalkeeper is entitled to do. Others have alleged that he intentionally collided with Battiston. Battiston also lost two teeth and had three cracked ribs. He received oxygen on the pitch. Michel Platini later said that he thought Battiston had died, because \\"he had no pulse and looked pale\\". The Dutch referee Charles Corver did not award a penalty for the incident. Schumacher proceeded to take the goal kick and play resumed. West Germany would eventually go on to win the game on penalty kicks after the match was tied at 3‚Äì3. Schumacher caused more controversy after the game with his response to news that Battiston had lost two teeth: \\"If that's all that's wrong, tell him I'll pay for the crowns.\\" Schumacher did visit Battiston in the hospital, and though the Frenchman felt his apology at the time as insincere, Battiston admitted that he had forgiven him by the time the two countries faced each other four years later in yet another World Cup semifinal. That match ended in a 2‚Äì0 victory for West Germany. A French newspaper poll asked which was the least popular man in France, and Schumacher beat Adolf Hitler into second. When West Germany and France met again in World Cup 1986, Battiston said that the incident was \\"forgiven and forgotten\\". However, he said that he was wary of getting \\"close to Schumacher\\" and said that he would hold a distance of at least 40 meters from the West German goalkeeper. Schumacher would mostly refrain from commenting on the incident. Coaching career As coach of SC Fortuna K√∂ln he was sacked at half time by club chairman Jean L√∂ring when his club was 0‚Äì2 behind against Waldhof Mannheim in December 1999. Autobiography In 1987, Schumacher's autobiography Anpfiff (\\"kick-off\\") was published in various countries, including France, where there was interest in Schumacher's comments on the Battiston incident. Schumacher maintained that his actions did not constitute a foul and that he was only trying to get the ball. He said that he did not go over to check on Battiston's condition because several French players were standing around Battiston and making threatening gestures in his direction. The book also included accounts of alleged improprieties by German football players, including substance abuse. This resulted in Schumacher's exclusion from the German national team and his long-term Bundesliga club, 1. FC K√∂ln. Personal life He is married to Jasmin Schumacher and has a daughter (Perla-Marie). He has a son, Oliver, and daughter, Vanessa, from his previous marriage to Marlies Schumacher. Honours 1\\\\.

Van Scyoc. It deals with an imagined world, Nor'Dyren, where an alien human-like species has a more structured social system than is the case for human society. When humans come to Nor'Dyren, they discover that there are three specialized types of Nor'Dyrenese. This three-way division of labor does not seem to be working. Nobody on Nor'Dyren knows how to repair broken machines. Nobody ever creates anything new. Archeological investigation reveals that the world Nor'Dyren has been in decline for 200 years from its cultural and technological apex. Plot details Eventually, the humans who are visiting Nor'Dyren discover that until 200 years previously, there were four distinct groups of Nor'Dyrenese. The fourth group (Qattagon) had been specialized to perform all of the creative work of society and was very artistic. However, the Qattagon had gotten too wild and radical and had come into conflict with the Gonnegon. This conflict ended when the administrative Gonnegon engineered the Qattagon out of the social system. This was possible because the Qattagon were not capable of reproducing; Qattagon were the result of interbreeding among the other three groups. To engineer Qattagon out of the society, the administrators decreed that members of each of the other three groups could only mate with other members of their own group. Under this imposed rule, none of the artistic hybrid Qattagon were born anymore. The reason that the Qattagon had gotten out of control and become a problem for Nor'Dyren was because the balance between the four groups had been engineered to be appropriate for worlds that were part of a large interstellar empire. But in the distant past, that empire had collapsed, leaving the planet Nor'Dyren isolated and unable to absorb the full force of the creativity of its Qattagon. Implications for human society Assignment Nor'Dyren is a pleasant mystery novel set on an interesting alien world, but it also leads the reader to think about some issues that are important on Earth. =Genetic engineering of the human species= The most interesting technical issue raised by this book concerns genetic engineering. The Allegon, Berregon, Gonnegon and Qattagon appear to be the result of genetic engineering, four specialized variations of the original species, rationally designed so as to form a stable social system. On Earth, humans now have the technology for genetically modifying our own species. We are also starting to explore space and confronting the problem of how to deal with the changes that come with science and technology. Is any human-like species biologically suited for dealing with the challenges of science, technology and space exploration? Is it inevitable that in order to survive its \\"technological adolescence\\", any species must get involved with genetically modifying itself? =Homosexuality and creativity= A major social issue raised by this book is the relationship between creativity and human homosexuality. The possibility of a link between homosexuality and creativity has been a matter of debate for many years,. Some view the idea of a link between creativity and homosexuality as a mythCSWT Reports at www.eng.uci.edu while at the same time taking note of the impact that homosexuals have on society: Research into possible differences in the brain that might be linked to homosexuality continues at a slow pace and remains fairly primitive,. The hypothesis that homosexuality can be associated with certain behavioral traits such as creativity remains a topic for further research.

It is chemically composed of 20.90% aluminium, 21.76% silicon, 1.56% hydrogen and 55.78% oxygen. It has the same composition as kaolinite, nacrite, and halloysite, but with a different crystal structure (polymorph). Dickite sometimes contains impurities such as titanium, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium. Dickite occurs with other clays and requires x-ray diffraction for its positive identification. Dickite is an important alteration indicator in hydrothermal systems as well as occurring in soils and shales. Dickite's type location is in Pant-y-Gaseg, Amlwch, Isle of Anglesey, Wales, United Kingdom, where it was first described in 1888. Dickite appears in locations with similar qualities and is found in China, Jamaica, France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Italy, Belgium and Canada. History In 1888, Allan Brugh Dick (1833‚Äì1926), a Scottish metallurgical chemist, was on the island of Anglesey to conduct research on kaolin. He performed various experiments describing the clay mineral. It was not until 1931 that Clarence S. Ross and Paul F. Kerr looked closer at the mineral and concluded that it was different from the known minerals of kaolinite and nacrite. They named it after the first person to describe the mineral. Composition is the chemical formula of dickite. The calculated percent abundances are very close when compared to other kaolin minerals. Chemical composition of dickite: * 46.54% * 39.50% * 13.96% Dickite and other kaolin minerals are commonly developed by weathering of feldspars and muscovite. Through its evolution, dickite, a phyllosilicate mineral, maintains the aluminium and silicon elements influencing the formation of hexagonal sheets common to clay minerals. The problem of mistaken identity arises when comparing dickite to other kaolin minerals due to the fact that kaolinite, dickite, and nacrite all have the same formula but different molecular structures. The only way to determine the true identity of the mineral is through powder x-ray diffraction and optical means. Geologic occurrence Dickite was first discovered in Almwch, Island of Anglesey, Wales, UK. Dickite is scattered across Wales forming occurrences in vein assemblages and as a rock-forming mineral. This area and others where dickite can be found all share similar characteristics. Pockets in phylloid algal limestones, in interstices of biocalcarenites and sandstone are a suitable environment for dickite. Very low pressure and high temperatures are the ideal environment for the formation of dickite. The more perfected crystallization of dickite occurs in porous algal limestones in the form of a white powder. The more disordered dickites can be found in less porous rocks. Another occurrence spot, as indicated by Brindley and Porter of the American Mineralogists journal, is the Northerly dickite-bearing zone in Jamaica. The dickite in this zone ranges from indurate breccias containing cream to pinkish and purplish fragments composed largely of dickite with subordinate anatase set in a matrix of greenish dickite, to discrete veins and surface coatings of white, cream and translucent dickite. It appears that dickite in the northerly zone were formed by hot ascending waters from an uncertain origin. Dickite is found worldwide in locations such as Ouray, Colorado, US; San Juanito, Chihuahua, Mexico in a silicified zone among the rhyolite area; and in St. George, Utah, US, where the mineral is thought to be associated with volcanic rock. An extensive study was done on dickite pertaining to its location in Pennsylvanian limestones of southeastern Kansas, US. In the dickite deposits of southeast Kansas the distribution is dependent on the following: the stratigraphic alternation of limestones and shales, westward regional dip, thick deposits of highly porous algal limestones, and igneous intrusions. It was found that groundwaters substantially heated along with magmatic waters which made its way up-dip and through the intrusions in the conduit-like algal mounds which allowed the dickite to be deposited in this area and it might be conclusive to say that this trend follows elsewhere in other locations around the world. Physical properties Dickite takes on the appearance of a white, brown earthy color and is often found embedded in many other minerals such as quartz. Dickite has perfect cleavage in the (001) direction. Its color varies from blue, gray, white to colorless. It usually has a dull clay-like texture. Its hardness on the Mohs scale is 1.5-2, basically between talc and gypsum. This is attributed to its loose chemical bonds. It is held with hydrogen bonds, which are otherwise weak. It leaves a white streak and it has a pearly luster. It has a density of 2.6. Dickite is biaxial, its birefringence is between 0.0050-0.0090, its surface relief is low and it has no dispersion. The plane of the optical axis is normal to the plane of symmetry and inclined 160, rear to the normal to (0,0,1). The atomic structure of dickite, being very similar to that of kaolinite and other kaolin type minerals, has a very specific arrangement that differs slightly enough to set its physical appearance and other physical properties apart from that of its family members kaolinite and nacrite. In a comparison of the family of minerals through experiments examined by Ross and Kerr the similarities between them are clearly evident and can, depending on the samples, be indistinguishable by optical means. The hexagonal structure and the stacking of the atoms influence the physical properties in many ways including the color, hardness, cleavage, density, and luster. Another important factor in influencing physical properties of minerals is the presence of bonding between atoms. Within dickite there exists dominant O-H bonding, a type of strong ionic bonding. Structure Dickite has a monoclinic crystal system and its crystal class is domatic (m). This crystal system contains two non-equal axes (a and b) that are perpendicular to each other and a third axis (c) that is inclined with respect to the an axis. The a and c axes lie in a plane. Dickite involves an interlayer bonding with at least 3 identifiable bonds: an ionic type interaction due to net unbalanced charges on the layers, Van der Waals forces between layers and hydrogen bonds between oxygen atoms on the surface of one layer and hydroxyl groups on the opposing surface. A hydrogen bond, as the term is used here, involves a long range interaction between hydrogen of a hydroxyl group coordinated to a cation and an oxygen atom coordinated to another cation. The reaction is predominantly electrostatic; hence an ionic bonding model is appropriate. Its axial ratio is a=0.576, b=1, c=1.6135. The hexagonal network of Si-O tetrahedra along with the superimposed layer of Al-O, OH octahedra make up the kaolin layer found in dickite. Dickite is composed of regular sequences of one, two and six kaolin layers. Analysis of the dickite structure reveals the space group to be C4s-Cc. The a and c axis both lie on the glide plane of symmetry. Dickite's structure is made up of a shared layer of corner-sharing tetrahedra filled by a plane of oxygens and hydroxyls along with a sheet of edge-sharing octahedra with every third site left empty. An experiment was conducted using a pseudo-hexagonal crystal of dickite to determine the unit cell information and the layers that exist within dickite. It was found that there are six layers within the kaolin layer within dickite. This is evidenced in the following findings. There is an oxygen atom from the all oxygen layer that lies at the center. The atoms of the O layer, the Si layer and the O, (OH) layer are situated for the ideal kaolin layer. X-ray experiments were performed by C. J. Ksanda and Tom F. W. Barth and it was concluded that dickite is composed of tiny layers of cations and anions which are parallel to the a-b plane stacked on top of one another which they found to be exactly as Gruner had described. It was also concluded that the two dimensional arrangement of some of the atoms are not as Gruner described.

The character appeared in specials and monthly titles detailing the afterlife of Elisa Cameron and her search for the truth surrounding her (apparent) death. Ghost first appeared in Comics' Greatest World, week three, in 1993. After a popular special in 1994, a monthly title devoted to the character began publication in 1995. It ran for 36 issues, followed by a six-month break and a second series of 22 issues. The second series was a continuation of the first with a number of changes, including new details about Ghost's origin. The stories in both series were based in (and around) the city of Arcadia, in a self-contained fictional universe outlined in Dark Horse's Comics' Greatest World. Ghost continued appearing in her own titles (and others) into the 2000s, including several crossovers unrelated to Comics' Greatest World. Most notable among these were a two-issue crossover with Dark Horse's Hellboy (Ghost/Hellboy), and a four- issue crossover with DC Comics' Batgirl (Ghost/Batgirl: The Resurrection Machine).  Origin  Elisa Cameron contained within her nanomites that allowed her to become ghost-like. Later, she became an assassin until her memories were erased. With few memories, she believed she really was a ghost and decided to investigate her past as \\"The Ghost\\".

The artwork was done by a number of people, and the series maintained high visual standards. Arcadia was intended to be grim, yet Art Deco; this was particularly reflected in the artwork of the early issues. Below is a list of issues and their art teams; if a team (or individual) repeats, only last names will be used: *Special: Matt Haley (pencils), Tom Simmons (inks), Adam Hughes (cover) (1994) *1-3: Adam Hughes (pencils), Mark Farmer (inks) (April‚ÄìJune 1995) *4: Haley and Simmons (July 1995) *5: Terry Dodson and Lee Moder (pencils), Gary Martin and Ande Parks (inks) (August 1995) *6‚Äì7: Scott Benefiel (pencils), Jasen Rodriguez (inks) (September‚ÄìOctober 1995) *8: George Dove (pencils), Bernard Kolle (inks) (November 1995) *9: H.M.

The following is a list of who did which covers; as above, full names used above will not be repeated here unless new. *1‚Äì3, 5‚Äì7: Hughes *4: Haley and Simmons *8: Baker *9, 11, 17: Brian Apthorp and Martin *10, 12‚Äì14: Stan Manoukian and Vince Roucher *15: Benefiel and Rodriguez *16, 18: Braithwaite and Cam Smith *19: Jason Pearson *20-24: Cassady and Emberlin *25, 32: Imagemakers and David Stewart, with Yvonne Epstein modeling (photo cover) *26-27: Denis Beauvais *28-31: Chris Warner *33-36: Tony Harris The series largely adopted a two- and four-issue story-arc structure for its final year. Storylines *Special, X #8, #1‚Äì12: Reporter Elisa Cameron is dead. She gradually reconciles with her sister Margo, and moves in with her and their newly-sober parents. Her parents are later murdered by a shadowy psionic to dissuade her from a news story she was investigating. Elisa has a fondness for jade, which prevents her from \\"ghosting\\" (passing through objects). She can teleport (which she calls \\"jumping\\"), but must pass a hellish region to do so. Elisa faces a number of psionics led by Dr. October, a woman who wanted to eliminate Elisa for her beauty even in death. She also must deal with a demon (Cameron Nemo), who escapes from her \\"hell\\" (causing a great deal of destruction), before King Tiger helps her defeat him. Elisa learns that her jumps, her hell and Nemo are figments of her imagination. She slowly introduces herself to Peter, a man she sees visiting the graveyard. Elisa's alliance with Barb Wire (a bounty hunter from Steel Harbor) results in her receiving a warning that Archibald Scythe (a psionic from her past) is coming for her. Margo falls under Scythe's spell, while an all-female paranormal team (the Furies) joins with Elisa to defeat him. Margo, driven by rage, summons up strange \\"shade-like\\" tears which defeat Scythe (but cost her her life). *#13-25: Crux (the man responsible for the deaths of Elisa's parents) tries to remove Elisa, causing a panic in the underworld and seriously injuring Peter. Shortly afterwards Cameron Nemo escapes from hell and takes over Scythe's body, becoming a lurking presence in her afterlife. Aided by X, King Tiger and Focus (leader of the Furies), Elisa discovers a tape with evidence of her death. Tracing the tape to Crux (who is planning to invade a secret city beneath Arcadia and recover a key which will give him power), Elisa and her companions help the Goblins (living in the secret city) by defeating Crux. Just before his death, Crux admits that he caused everything‚Äîfrom her parents' murders to the psionic hunters and Elisa's death. Elisa then becomes Sentinel of Arcadia. *#26-36: Dr. October resurfaces, but is quickly defeated. Peter and Elisa slowly develop a relationship while Elisa, aided by the Goblins, tries to protect the city. She encounters Dr. Trouvaille, who experiments with the spirits of his victims; he calls her \\"the failed one\\", hinting that he knows secrets unrevealed by Crux. Margo, somehow alive and possessed by a being known as Silhouette, tries to destroy Arcadia but is saved by Elisa. =Volume two= Creators The series was re-launched in the fall of 1998 with a new creative staff. An attempt was made to make the artwork sleeker, sexier and more beautiful than the previous series. Like the first series, the second adapted a mini-series approach. The following is a list of the staff; when repeated, only the surname will be used: *1‚Äì6: Chris Warner (writer), Christian Zanier (pencils), Steve Moncuse (inks), Ryan Benjamin (covers) *7‚Äì10 (\\"Shifter\\"): Warner and Mike Kennedy (writers), Zanier (pencils), Moncuse (inks), Benjamin (covers) *11‚Äì15 (12‚Äì15, \\"Red Shadows\\"): Warner (writer), Benjamin (art) *16‚Äì17(\\"When the Devil Daydreams\\"): Kennedy (writer), Francisco Ruiz Valesco and Benjamin (art) *18‚Äì19: Kennedy (writer), Benjamin (art), Denis Beauvais (cover) *20: Kennedy (writer), Benjamin (art) *21: Kennedy (writer), Benjamin (art), Beauvais (cover) *22: Kennedy (writer), Benjamin and Lucas Marangnon (pencils), Moncuse and Mike Henry (inks), Benjamin (cover) Storylines *#1‚Äì6: Elisa learns from the mysterious Concordia Leveche that she is not really dead. Instead, her \\"death\\" is linked to Scythe and Trouvaille (who are conducting experiments in which souls are stripped from their bodies, \\"rendered\\" and replaced with beings from another dimension). Trouvaille captures Elisa, and shows her the tape. From it, she learns that she killed Crux. Trouvaille, aided by Scythe, tries ripping Elisa's soul from her body; however, during the procedure Cameron Nemo briefly appears. Elisa then vanishes. Silhouette is back in control of Margo's body while Margo's soul awaits rendering. Elisa escapes and fights Silhouette, who escapes (still controlling Margo's body). Elisa then kills Trouvaille. She has learned that Focus was in league with Trouvaille, and soon discovers the same is true of Peter. She suggests that he commit suicide, while Focus informs Elisa that she had been one of the Furies. Soon, she finds Cameron Scythe. Nemo (who reveals that as part of Elisa's subconscious he has always known her) is returned to Elisa's hell. Margo (now a being like Elisa) appears and shoots Scythe through the skull, killing him. *#7‚Äì15: Elisa, Concordia and Margo go to Hoyo Grande to ask King Tiger for help. Instead, they help a depressed Tiger regain his energy and battle the shape-shifting Szothstromael clan. Elisa has a revelatory encounter with the man from the vortex, who \\"reboots\\" her brain. This enables her to remember that her biological father (Dan Deerlane) was shot by her adoptive father before her eyes when she was very young; the pain deadened her to that of others, leading to her life as a Fury assassin. Silhouette returns, using Trouvaille's technology to transfer more beings into the bodies of Scythe's remaining followers. Sent as ghost-hunters, they attack Elisa and her friends. Failing that, Trouvaille (whose body is dead but whose essence exists within his armor) joins them to defeat Elisa and complete his experiments. They take Margo and Concordia, but Peter returns to aid Elisa in her battle. Margo's body is recovered, Silhouette is defeated, and Trouvaille and the hunters appear to be eliminated. Giving Peter the brush-off, Elisa leaves with her newly revived sister.  Special issues  Two special issues were published after Eric Luke's series ended, written by writers who did not contribute to the regular series: *Ghost Special 2 (Immortal Coil) (1998): Written by Martin Lodewyk, pencils by H. M. Baker, inks by Bernard Kolle, cover by Dave Stewart (featuring model Yvonne Epstein). Set some time after Silhouette appears, the Goblins have yet to return to Arcadia and a worried Elisa must rescue Barb Wire from a South American businessman (Mr. Borazzon) *Ghost Special 3 (Scary Monsters) (1998): \\"Mayfly\\" written by Tom Sneigoski, \\"Secrets\\" written by Lee Swank. Both sections have pencils by H. M. Baker and inks by Bernard Kolle; cover by Baker and Kolle. In \\"Mayfly\\", Elisa battles large insect-like creatures controlled by a woman who wants revenge for an accident during her youth. In \\"Secrets\\", Elisa reflects on the secrets of people in Arcadia. A man she calls \\"Bookworm\\", while seemingly innocuous in breaking into the library to read ancient books every evening, is really planning to raise a demon. = Resurrection Mary= Ghost was revived as part of Dark Horse's Project Black Sky with a new storyline entitled \\"Resurrection Mary\\", which launched the third series in Dark Horse Presents #13 cover-dated June 2012. In the three-part serialized story, Elisa's spirit is revived when two investigators from a Ghost Hunters-like TV series, armed with an experimental piece of paranormal technology, investigate a cemetery where a woman in white (called \\"Resurrection Mary\\") has been spotted. Eliza appears to have lost her memory; she and the paranormal investigators she befriends cover up her self-defence killing and resolve to solve the mystery of her identity. A notable change for this reboot is that the traditional setting of Arcadia was replaced by Chicago, Illinois. The serial concluded with DHP #15, after which Dark Horse published Ghost #0 in September 2012; this reprinted the three DHP chapters as a prelude to a new series, Ghost: In the Smoke and Din. =Volume Three (In the Smoke and Din)= Creators Dark Horse launched a third series, In the Smoke and Din, consisting of four issues published from September 2012. The writer was Kelly Sue DeConnick with art by Phil Noto (pencils). =Volume Four= Creators Kelly Sue DeConnick returned in 2013 to write a second series for Dark Horse, ending in 2015 with issue 12. This series was collected as Ghost Volume 1-4. The following is a list of the staff; when repeated, only the surname will be used: * 1 - 4, Kelly Sue DeConnick (writer), Chris Sebela (writer), Ryan Sook, Drew Johnson, Geraldo Borges (pencils), Richard Starkings (letters). * 5 - 8, Chris Sebela (writer), Jan Duursema (pencils), Dan Parsons (Inks), Richard Starkings (letters). * 9 - 12, Chris Sebela (writer), Harvey Tolibao (pencils), Richard Starkings (letters).

He was a professor of economics at New York University, Academic Director of the Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Professor Emeritus at Princeton University. He was a prolific author of more than eighty books and several hundred journal articles. Baumol wrote extensively about labor market and other economic factors that affect the economy. He also made significant contributions to the theory of entrepreneurship and the history of economic thought. He is among the most influential economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. Baumol was considered a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Economics for 2003, and Thomson Reuters cited him as a potential recipient in 2014, but he died without receiving the prize. Early life Baumol was born in the South Bronx. His parents, Solomon and Lillian, were both immigrants from Eastern Europe. Baumol studied at the City College of New York and was awarded his bachelor's degree in 1942. After college, he served in the U.S. Army in World War II and later worked for the Department of Agriculture as an economist. Education He was initially denied entry to the doctoral studies at the London School of Economics and was instead admitted to the Master's program. After witnessing his debating skills at Lord Lionel Robbins' seminars, he was within weeks switched to the doctoral program and also admitted to the faculty as an Assistant Lecturer. Teaching While a professor at Princeton University he supervised some graduate students who would eventually become very well-known economists, including Burton Malkiel, William G. Bowen, and Harold Tafler Shapiro. Research Precursors in mathematical economics, 1968 Among his better-known contributions are the theory of contestable markets, the Baumol- Tobin model of transactions demand for money, Baumol's cost disease, which discusses the rising costs associated with service industries, Baumol's sales revenue maximization model and Pigou taxes. His research on environmental economics recognized the fundamental role of non-convexities in causing market failures. with Page 73 (and for other contributions of Baumol pages 42, 68, and 155): Non-convexities also appear in Baumol's theory of contestable markets: Pages 179‚Äì181: page 88: William Baumol also contributed to the transformation of the field of finance, and published contributions to the areas of efficiency of capital markets, portfolio theory, and capital budgeting. =Entrepreneurship= The place of the disruptive innovations and innovative entrepreneurs in traditional economic theory (which describes many efficiency-based ratios assuming uniform outputs) presents theoretic quandaries. Baumol contributed greatly to this area of economic theory. The 2006 Annual Meetings of the American Economic Association held a special session in his name, and honoring his many years of work in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation, where 12 papers on entrepreneurship were presented. The Baumol Research Centre for Entrepreneurship Studies at Zhejiang Gongshang University is named after William Baumol. In 2003, Baumol received the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research \\"[f]or his persistent effort to give the entrepreneur a key role in mainstream economic theory, for his theoretical and empirical studies of the nature of entrepreneurship, and for his analysis of the importance of institutions and incentives for the allocation of entrepreneurship.\\" The British news magazine, The Economist published an article about William Baumol and his lifelong work to develop a place in economic theory for the entrepreneur (March 11, 2006, pp 68), much of which owes its genesis to Joseph Schumpeter. They note that traditional microeconomic theory normally holds a place for 'prices' and 'firms' but not for that (seemingly) important engine of innovation, the entrepreneur. Baumol is given credit for helping to remedy this shortcoming: \\"Thanks to Mr. Baumol's own painstaking efforts, economists now have a bit more room for entrepreneurs in their theories.\\" William Baumol's book, The Microtheory of Innovative Entrepreneurship is the first formal theoretical analysis of the role of innovative entrepreneurs. Textbooks Baumol wrote several textbooks in economics, including an introductory textbook with Alan Blinder titled Macroeconomics: Principles and Policy. His economics textbook on operations research was internationally well-received: > In the 1960s and 1970s, nearly every economics department offered a course > in operations research methods in economics, and the usual textbook used was > Economic Theory and Operations Analysis by W. J. Baumol. An entire > generation of economics students was familiar with this book .... Professional and philanthropic interests Baumol was a trustee of Economists for Peace and Security. Baumol was known for his interests in the economics of art, including the economics of the performing arts. Death Baumol died on May 4, 2017 at the age of 95.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/william-baumol-economist-who-found- logic-in-rising-health-care-prices-dies- at-95/2017/05/05/25439850-3108-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html Major publications * \\"Community Indifference\\", 1946, RES * \\"A Community Indifference Map: A construction\\", 1949, RES. * \\"A Formalization of Mr. Harrod's Model\\", 1949, EJ. * \\"The Analogy between Producer and Consumer Equilibrium Analysis\\", with Helen Makower, 1950, Economica. * Economic Dynamics, with R.

It is accommodated within Reading Town Hall, and contains galleries describing the history of Reading and its related industries, a gallery of artefacts discovered during the excavations of Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester Roman Town), a copy of the Bayeux Tapestry, finds relating to Reading Abbey and an art collection.Reading Museum, Culture24, UK.  History of the museum  Reading Town Hall was built in several phases between 1786 and 1897, although the principal facade was designed by Alfred Waterhouse in 1875. In 1879, the foundation stone was laid for a new wing containing a library and museum, and the museum duly opened in 1883. Three art galleries were added in further extension in 1897. In 1975, the civic offices moved out of the Town Hall to Reading Civic Centre. They were followed in 1985 by the Reading Central Library which left only the museum and the concert hall in use. After some debate, plans to demolish the Town Hall and replace it with a new cultural centre were abandoned, and in 1986 refurbishment of the building started. The museum was closed for renewal in 1989, reopening in stages from 1993 (the Reading: People & Place gallery) to 2000.  Principal galleries  =Story of Reading Gallery= This documents Reading's history, from its origins as a Saxon settlement in the 6th century up to today, with a mixture of oral history presentations, interactive displays and a mix of real objects from the period. There is an emphasis on Reading Abbey. =The Silchester Gallery= The gallery features many archeological finds from the excavations conducted at the nearby Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester Roman Town) together with explanatory models and other information on life in the Roman town. This includes the bronze Silchester eagle that was immortalised by Rosemary Sutcliff in her children‚Äôs book The Eagle of the Ninth, first published in 1954. The Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum was excavated in the 1860s, unearthing a diversity of finds including jewellery, fine glass and pottery, sculpture, mosaics, iron tools and coins. Many items found during the excavation are displayed in the gallery. Items of particular note include the Silchester eagle, the Silchester Horse and the damaged head of Seraphis. A model of the Roman town is also on display. =Atrium= This space provides seating around a Roman pavement mosaic from the Silchester site, where a 4th century Christian church is thought to have existed. On the wall are displays of two large mosaics from Silchester. The mosaics are juxtaposed with ceramics of Alan Caiger-Smith produced at his Aldermaston Pottery. =The Bayeux Gallery= The Bayeux Tapestry Gallery The Bayeux Tapestry Gallery Reading Museum‚Äôs Bayeux Tapestry Gallery exhibits an accurate replica of the Bayeux Tapestry, made by 35 women of the Leek Embroidery Society in 1885. The tapestry is the only known full size woven copy of the original tapestry in existence. The tapestry is 70 metres long and depicts the events of the Norman Conquest of England by William, Duke of Normandy in 1066. This includes the preamble to conflict, followed by the preparations for war and decisive Norman victory in the Battle of Hastings. Information boards around the exhibit offer a translation of the original Medieval Latin, while providing the visitor with a historical description of the conquest. The final section of the Tapestry, which included William‚Äôs coronation at Winchester cathedral, was lost before the copy was made. The events have a local significance to Reading, for King William‚Äôs youngest son Henry I founded Reading Abbey in 1121 and was later buried there. The exhibit is complemented by information on the history of Saxon migration and Viking raids in the local area.Britain's Bayeux Tapestry at the Reading Museum, Reading Museum Service, Reading Borough Council, UK. = The Green Space= The Green Space Gallery The Gallery explains the geology and natural history of the Reading area through a large display of specimens. Exploring the history of the Reading area from 400 million years ago to the present day, it explains what was in the area before people existed and how Reading's landscape and environment has developed and been influenced by human activity since the Stone Age.The Green Space Gallery - Museum of Reading website The Gallery also shows the animals and plants living in the Reading area today. Highlights in the display include a complete Iron Age dog skeleton discovered and excavated at Blewburton hillfort; and a royal red deer stag which was donated to the Museum by George V from the royal herd at Windsor Great Park. =Huntley & Palmers Gallery= The Huntley & Palmers Gallery Explains the history of the biscuit-making industry that was once one of the mainstays of the Reading economy, with special emphasis on the Huntley and Palmers company, Reading's world famous biscuit makers. The display charts how how Huntley & Palmers pioneered the mass production of biscuits and explains why Reading became known as the 'Biscuit Town'.The Huntley and Palmers Gallery - Museum of Reading website The display shows what factory life was like for Huntley & Palmers' thousands of employees explained through oral recordings, photographs and historic film, including the earliest surviving film of a British factory in action. Highlights of the display include about 300 decorative biscuit tins as well as advertising material and other artefacts; an African thumb piano crafted from a Huntley & Palmers biscuit tin; a biscuit supplied to Captain Scott's final Antarctic expedition, and an example of the rude ‚ÄòKate Greenaway‚Äô biscuit tin that continues to embarrass the company today. =The Windows Gallery= This Gallery is named The Windows Gallery as it is a 'window' on the Museum's wide collection of sculpture and decorative art, ranging from Romanesque stones from the 12th- century from Reading Abbey to modern pieces by Rodin and Epstein. Originally, this section of the Museum housed the Reading School of Art and as such was designed to be well-lit by natural daylight from the windows on either side. Highlights of the collection include: Romanesque capitals from Reading Abbey; sculpture by Rodin, Epstein and Gibbings, and Delftware plates and other ceramics.The Window Gallery - Museum of Reading website =The Sir John Madejski Art Gallery= This is a recreation of the museum's original Victorian era art gallery and houses changing exhibitions of artworks. It is named after John Madejski, the chairman of Reading F.C.. =The Exhibition Gallery= Designed to house changing exhibitions, both from the museum's collection and external sources. As an example, in late 2004, the gallery contained an exhibition on the history of the Reading Festival.  Access  The museum is free to visit. As of February 2020, it is open from 10:00 to 16:00 on Tuesday to Friday, 10.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays, and closed all day Monday and Sunday, with exceptions for holidays.  Charitable  Reading Foundation for Art was set up in 1974 with the ambition of building an art collection to enrich the lives of the local residents and enhance the cultural fabric of Reading and the surrounding areas. It now has a collection of over 150 works on permanent loan to Reading Museum and is a registered Charity.

Have Blue was designed by Lockheed's Skunk Works division, and tested at Groom Lake, Nevada. The Have Blue was the first fixed-wing aircraft whose external shape was defined by radar engineering rather than by aerospace engineering. The aircraft's faceted shape was designed to deflect electromagnetic waves in directions other than that of the originating radar emitter, greatly reducing its radar cross-section. To design the aircraft, the Skunk Works' design team leveraged the mathematics published by Soviet physicist and mathematician Petr Ufimtsev regarding the reflection of electromagnetic waves. A stealth engineer at Lockheed, Denys Overholser, had read the publication and realized that Ufimtsev had created the mathematical theory and tools to do finite analysis of radar reflection. The eventual design characteristically featured faceted surfaces to deflect radar waves away from a radar receiver. It had highly-swept wings and inward-canted vertical stabilizers, which led to its being nicknamed \\"the Hopeless diamond\\" - a pun on the \\"Hope diamond.\\" The first operational aircraft made its maiden flight on 1 December 1977. Two flyable vehicles were constructed. Both were lost due to mechanical problems. Nevertheless, Have Blue was deemed a success, paving the way for the first operational stealth aircraft, Senior Trend, or Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk. Background In the 1970s, it became increasingly apparent to U.S. planners that, in a military confrontation with Warsaw Pact forces, NATO aircraft would quickly suffer heavy losses. This came as a result of sophisticated Soviet defense networks, which used surveillance radars, radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM), and anti-aircraft artillery to seek and eliminate enemy aircraft. Consequently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started a study on low-observability aircraft, seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft. Five companies were initially invited, three of which bowed out early. The remaining two were later joined by Lockheed. Design and development = Origins = The Lockheed Have Blue was born out of a requirement to evade radar detection. During the Vietnam War, radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti- aircraft artillery (AAA) posed a significant threat to US aircraft. As such, strike aircraft during the war often required support aircraft to perform combat air patrols and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD).Crickmore 2003, p. 9. The 1973 Yom Kippur War again highlighted the vulnerability of aircraft to SAMs ‚Äì the Israeli Air Force lost 109 aircraft in 18 days. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed an integrated defense network, central to which were medium- to long-range surveillance radars. SAMs and AAAs would be set up around key locations to defend them from incoming enemy aircraft. If the loss ratio of Israel during the Yom Kippur War was experienced by NATO forces during a military confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, NATO aircraft numbers would be depleted within two weeks. In 1974, DARPA secretly requested answers from five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first was about the signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies had the capability to design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.Jenkins 1999, p. 15. = Design effort and early testing = Lockheed, having been absent from the fighter aircraft industry for 10 years, was not approached by DARPA in 1974. Ed Martin, Lockheed California Companies director of science and engineering, became aware of the research into stealth during his work at the Pentagon and Wright-Patterson AFB.Crickmore 2003, p. 10. Martin and Ben Rich, who at that time had recently become Skunk Works' president, briefed Clarence \\"Kelly\\" Johnson on the program. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gave Skunk Works permission to discuss with DARPA the stealth characteristics of the A-12, M-21 and D-21. On behalf of the company, Rich and Martin formally requested permission from DARPA to participate in the program, but the agency initially refused because there were insufficient funds; after much debate, Lockheed was allowed entry, albeit without a government contract. Kelly Johnson, Lockheed's designer, was an initial skeptic of the Have Blue design, incorrectly remarking: \\"Our old D-21 drone has a lower radar cross-section than that goddamn diamond\\".alt=Black-and-white portrait photograph of gray-haired man in suit posing to the right; a number of plaques are present on the wall behind. Preliminary designer Dick Scherrer requested possible shapes upon which he could base his low radar cross-section (RCS) design. He was introduced to Denys Overholser, who recommended an aircraft with flat surfaces. Overholser later recounted his discussion with Sherrer: \\"When Dick Scherrer asked me ... I said 'Well, it's simple, you just make it out of flat surfaces, and tilt those flat surfaces over, sweeping the edges away from the radar view angle, and that way you basically cause the energy to reflect away from the radar.'\\"Crickmore 2003, p. 11. Scherrer subsequently drew a preliminary low-RCS aircraft with faceted surfaces. At the same time, Overholser hired mathematician Bill Schroeder, with whom he had a prior working relationship ‚Äì in fact, it was Schroeder who trained Overholser on mathematics relating to stealth aircraft. Kenneth Watson was hired as the senior lead aircraft designer. During the next few weeks, the team created a computer program which could evaluate the RCS of possible designs. The RCS- prediction software was called \\"ECHO 1\\". As tests with the program proceeded, it became apparent that edge calculations by the program were incorrect due to diffraction. In 1964, Pyotr Ufimtsev, the chief scientist of the Moscow Institute for Radio Engineering, published a seminal paper titled Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction.Ufimtsev, P. Ya. \\"Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction.\\" Oai.dtic.mil. Retrieved 30 July 2011. The work was translated by the Air Force Systems Command's Foreign Technology Division; subsequently, Overholser incorporated elements of Ufimtsev's work to refine the software.Jenkins 1999, p. 16. ECHO 1 allowed the team to quickly decide which of the 20 possible designs were optimal, finally settling on the faceted delta-wing design.Crickmore 2003, p. 12. However, many within the division were skeptical of the shape, giving rise to the name \\"Hopeless Diamond\\"Sweetman 2005, p. 25. ‚Äì Kelly Johnson said to Rich, \\"Our old D-21 drone has a lower radar cross-section than that goddamn diamond\\". In May 1975, the Skunk Works produced an internal report titled, \\"Progress Report No. 2, High Stealth Conceptual Studies.\\" Within it was a concept study called \\"Little Harvey,\\" including Kelly Johnson's drawing of an aircraft with smoothly blended shapes. Johnson advocated for the use of blended shapes as the best way to achieve stealth, while Ben Rich advocated for faceted angles. Rich won the argument with Johnson, a rare occurrence.Slattery, Chad, \\"Secrets of the Skunk Works,\\" Air & Space, August 2014, p.41 The design effort produced a number of wooden models. A 24-inch long model, made of balsa wood, demonstrated placement of internal structure and access doors. An Air & Space article noted \\"The model shop found it nearly impossible to make all the flat surfaces come to a single point in one corner. Engineers later encountered the same difficulty fabricating the prototype on the factory floor.\\"Slattery, p.43 For early tests of the design, two ‚Öì-scale wooden mock-ups were constructed. One model, coated in metal foil, was used to verify ECHO 1's RCS calculations, while the other was earmarked for wind tunnel tests. Afterwards, a model was moved to the Grey Butte Range radar-testing facility in the Mojave Desert near Palmdale, which allowed more accurate tests of the aircraft's RCS. In the event, the aircraft's RCS level confirmed ECHO 1's predictions. This meant Ben Rich won a quarter from Johnson, who previously insisted that the D-21 had less RCS than Have Blue. = Experimental Survivable Testbed = In the summer of 1975, DARPA informally invited Lockheed, Northrop and McDonnell Douglas to develop an aircraft under the name \\"Experimental Survivable Testbed\\" (XST).Jenkins 1999, p. 17. McDonnell Douglas, having identified the thresholds at which aircraft were deemed undetectable, was unable to design and produce such an aircraft.Crickmore 2003, p. 13. Phase 1 of XST would see both Lockheed and Northrop build full-scale models to test their RCS, construct flyable vehicles, and wind-tunnel test their designs. Following Phase 1, a sole contractor would be selected to continue with the construction and flight testing of two demonstrators as part of Phase 2. Northrop's and Lockheed's designs were generally similar, though the former's submission featured more angular and flat surfaces. The company used \\"GENSCAT\\", software similar to ECHO 1, to calculate the RCS of its designs.Jenkins 1999, p. 18. On 1 November 1975, Lockheed and Northrop were each awarded $1.5-million contracts to proceed with Phase 1 of XST.Aronstein and Piccirillo 1997, p. 29. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full- scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF's Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched. In March 1976, a Lockheed model was transferred to the range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winnerAronstein and Piccirillo 1997, pp. 32‚Äì33. because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, the B-2 bomber.Aronstein and Piccirillo 1997, p. 33. = Construction and further tests = Underside view of Have Blue Skunk Works now had to design, construct and flight test two manned demonstrators as part of Phase 2, or Have Blue. To build the demonstrators, Ben Rich had to raise $10.4 million from the Lockheed management, which was secured by June. Phase 2 encompassed three main objectives, which were the validation of: reduced visibility in the radio wave, infrared, and visual spectrums and reduced acoustical observability; acceptable flying qualities; and the \\"modeling capabilities that accurately predict low observable characteristics of an aircraft in flight\\". Construction of both Have Blue demonstrators used leftover tools from the C-5 program. Final assembly of HB1001 was originally scheduled to be completed in August 1977, before being ground tested until mid-October. The secret roll-out was envisaged to occur on 23 October, after which the aircraft would be dismantled and transported to the test area.Crickmore 2003, p. 16. On 1 September, however, with HB1001 partially complete, Lockheed machinists went on a four-month strike. A group of managers took over the job of assembly, which was completed in six weeks, with ground tests beginning on 17 October.Crickmore 2003, p. 17. While superficially similar to the later F-117, the Have Blue prototypes were smaller aircraft, about one quarter the weight of the F-117, with a wing sweep of 72.5¬∞ and inward-canted vertical tails (inverse V-tail).Eden 2004, p. 243.Aronstein, Hirschberg and Piccirillo 1998, p. 261. Radar-absorbent material (RAM), developed in a Lockheed laboratory, was applied to the aircraft's flat surfaces ‚Äì for the windscreen, special coatings were applied to give them metallic characteristics.Donald 2003, p. 67.Eden 2004, p. 242. The aircraft's gross weight of 9,200‚Äì12,500 lb (4,173‚Äì5,669 kg) enabled the aircraft to use the landing gear from the Northrop F-5 fighter. The aircraft's powerplants were two General Electric J85-GE-4As from the T-2C Buckeye.Sweetman 2005, p 30. Because stealth took precedence above all else, the aircraft was inherently unstable. As a result, a quadruple redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system was integrated into the aircraft to give it normal flying characteristics. The flight control system was borrowed from the F-16.Aronstein, Hirschberg and Piccirillo 1998, p. 263. The overwing engine inlet was covered by a low-RCS grid; during takeoffs, when more air is needed, blow-in doors were constructed at the upper fuselage to admit additional airflow.Crickmore 2003, pp. 15‚Äì16. Throughout the one and a half months after the start of ground tests, HB1001, the first of two demonstrators, underwent tests in preparations for the first flight. Flight instrumentation was checked first, followed by a thorough shakedown of the aircraft. In early November, two semi-trailers were parked parallel to each other outside Building 82; a camouflage net was thrown over the top to cover the demonstrator during outdoor engine runs. During the engine tests, a local resident complained about the noise, but Have Blue retained its secrecy. HB1001 received a layer of iron-coat paint; during the weekend of 12‚Äì13 November, the aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by Alan Brown, Have Blues chief technical engineer. The scheme, consisting of three colors, each with three tones, was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing the design's characteristic faceting. The aircraft was disassembled, loaded onto a C-5, and on 16 November, the aircraft was flown from Burbank Airport (since renamed Bob Hope Airport) to Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. Upon touchdown, the aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to the first flight.Crickmore 2003, pp. 17‚Äì18. After four taxi tests, HB1001 was ready for test flights.Crickmore 2003, p. 19.  Operational history  = HB1001 = HB1001 made its first flight on 1 December 1977 at the hands of Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He would fly the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was previously approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17 January 1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two would be the only test pilots of Have Blue, alternating between the demonstrator and the chase plane.Crickmore 2003, p. 20. Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system. At the same time, they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft's behavior. Flight tests proceeded fairly smoothly until 4 May 1978, when HB1001 was making its 36th flight. The aircraft pitched up just as it made contact with the ground which forced the pilot, Bill Park, to abort the landing and make a second attempt. The impact had however been so hard that the landing gear had become jammed in a semi-retracted position. Efforts to lower the gear were unsuccessful and Bill Park was forced to climb again, and eject when his fuel ran out. The aircraft was destroyed on impact in the vicinity of the Groom Lake facility.Jenkins and Landis 2008, p. 232. Park survived, but suffered a concussion, forcing him to retire from further test flights.Crickmore 2003, p. 21. Dyson, who was in the chase plane, recounted: \\"Just before touchdown the airplane pitched up... It seemed it slammed down on the ground real hard... He [Park] raised the gear on the go around, and when he tried to extend it on approach, only one of the mains and the nose wheel came down. All this time, gas was being consumed... I suggested he climb up to 10,000 feet for ejection... He started climbing, but the engine started flaming out, from the lack of fuel, so he ejected.\\" = HB1002 = At the time of the crash, HB1002 was almost complete, with the lessons learned from the HB1001 incorporated into the aircraft, including the rebuilding of the aft fuselage. HB1002 was distinguished from the prototype in having a gray paint coat. It did not have the flight test instrumentation boom present on HB1001's nose. As the aircraft was used to test RCS returns, the unstealthy spin recovery chute was removed, and the aircraft was covered in radar-absorbent material. It first flew on 20 July 1978 with Dyson at the controls, who would be the only pilot to fly the aircraft.Crickmore 2003, p. 22. HB1002 was lost on 11 July 1979 during the aircraft's 52nd flight. A hydraulic leak caused an engine fire, resulting in the loss of hydraulic pressure, which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed.Jenkins and Landis 2008, p. 233. It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built up there, causing the hydraulic lines to fail.Crickmore 2003, p. 23. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis Air Force Base Complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.Donald 2003, p. 72. = Senior Trend = In October 1977, just prior to Phase 2 of the XST competition, Lockheed was tasked with exploring possible operational aircraft. Just a month later, on the day HB1001 was transported to Groom Lake, the Air Force awarded the company a contract under the code name Senior Trend. The Air Force wanted to exploit the revolutionary technologies developed during the Have Blue program.Crickmore 2003, p. 25. Tactical Air Command ordered five full-scale development and twenty production aircraft. Based on the Have Blue demonstrators, Senior Trend aircraft were different from their predecessors in several aspects. The wings exhibited less sweep to resolve a center-of-gravity problem discovered during tests. The front fuselage was shortened to give the pilot a better view, and the vertical stabilizers were canted outwards from the centerline. Additionally, provisions were made to include two weapons bays, each of which would accommodate a single laser-guided bomb, or the B61 tactical nuclear bomb. Beset by early construction problems, the first FSD aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in May 1981 inside a C-5. Further problems, this time with fuel leaks, delayed the first flight. Under the control of Harold Farley, the aircraft took off on 18 June for its maiden flight, nine months after the July 1980 first flight originally envisaged. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and operational capability was achieved in October 1983; the 59th and last F-117A was delivered in 1990.Goodall 1992, p. 29.

L. Carr, first published in 1980 and nominated for the Booker Prize. The book won the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1980. The story The plot concerns Tom Birkin, a World War I veteran employed to uncover a mural in a village church that was thought to exist under coats of whitewash. At the same time another veteran is employed to look for a grave beyond the churchyard walls. Though Birkin is an unbeliever there is prevalent religious symbolism throughout the book, mainly dealing with judgment. The novel explores themes of England's loss of spirituality after the war, and of happiness, melancholy, and nostalgia as Birkin recalls the summer uncovering the mural, when he healed from his wartime experiences and a broken marriage. In an essay for Open Letters Monthly, Ingrid Norton praised the novel's subtlety: > The happiness depicted in A Month in the Country is wise and wary, aware of > its temporality. When he arrives in Oxgodby, Birkin knows very well life is > not all ease and intimacy, long summer days with \\"winter always loitering > around the corner.\\" He has experienced emotional cruelty in his failed > marriage. As a soldier, he witnessed death: destruction and unending mud. > But the edges are brighter for it. Birkin's idyll in the country is brought > into relief by what Birkin has gone through in the past and the > disappointments that, it is implied, await him. Carr's great art is to make > it clear that joy is inseparable from the pain and oblivion which unmake it. Many of the incidents in the novel are based on real events in Carr's own life, and some of the characters are modelled on his own Methodist family. The book The jacket illustration shows Tintagel Parish Church in Cornwall whereas the story is set in Yorkshire. The grave outside the churchyard wall was suggested by Tintagel where a number of early graves were encountered at Trecarne Lands and excavated. The text finishes with the words, 'Stocken, Presteigne, 1978' Although the book is set in North Yorkshire, Carr wrote early drafts while staying in his caravan in the top orchard at Stocken Farm, just outside Presteigne in Powys, Wales. The novel is a set book as a part of some secondary school English courses. Dramatisation With a screenplay by Simon Gray, the novel was made into a 1987 film, directed by Pat O'Connor and starring Colin Firth, Kenneth Branagh, Natasha Richardson and Patrick Malahide. Shortly before his death, Dave Sheasby completed a radio adaptation of the book, which was first broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 Saturday Play in November 2010 and repeated in May 2012.A Month in the Country , BBC Radio 4.

This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is rejected by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is altered by an abortion, then more immature cells could be left behind, and that these immature cells could increase the risk of breast cancer over time. The abortion‚Äìbreast cancer hypothesis has been the subject of extensive scientific inquiry, and the scientific community has concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer and that breast cancer should not be a concern for women who are having a miscarriage or considering having an abortion. This consensus is supported by major medical bodies, including the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the German Cancer Research Center, and the Canadian Cancer Society. Some anti-abortion activists have continued to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion as a cause of breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias. The ongoing promotion of a link between abortion and breast cancer is seen by others as part of the anti-abortion \\"woman-centered\\" strategy against abortion. Anti-abortion groups maintain they are providing information necessary for legally required informed consent, a concern shared by some politically conservative politicians. The abortion‚Äìbreast cancer issue remains the subject of political controversy.  Views of medical organizations  Major medical organizations which have analyzed data on abortion and breast cancer have uniformly concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer. These organizations include the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the German Cancer Research Center, and the Canadian Cancer Society. * The World Health Organization concluded in 2012 that \\"sound epidemiological data show no increased risk of breast cancer for women following spontaneous or induced abortion\\", updating their earlier finding that \\"induced abortion does not increase breast cancer risk\\". * The American Cancer Society concluded: \\"At this time, the scientific evidence does not support the notion that abortion of any kind raises the risk of breast cancer or any other type of cancer.\\" * The U.S. National Cancer Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, found that \\"induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk\\", assigning this conclusion the strongest possible evidence rating. * The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that \\"early studies of the relationship between prior induced abortion and breast cancer risk were methodologically flawed. More rigorous recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk.\\" * The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reviewed the medical literature and concluded that \\"there is no established link between induced abortion or miscarriage and development of breast cancer.\\" The College recommended in its official clinical practice guidelines that \\"Women should be informed that induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.\\" * The German Cancer Research Center concluded in 2013 that abortion and miscarriage pose no risk of breast cancer. * The Canadian Cancer Society stated in 2013: \\"The body of scientific evidence does not support an association between abortion and increased breast cancer risk.\\" Proponents Joel Brind, a faculty member at Baruch College in the Department of Natural Sciences, is the primary advocate of an abortion-breast cancer (\\"ABC\\") link. Brind is strongly anti-abortion and began lobbying politicians with the claim that abortion caused breast cancer in the early 1990s. Brind found that his lobbying efforts were not taken seriously because he had not published his findings in the peer-reviewed medical literature. He therefore collaborated with two anti-abortion physicians and a statistician to publish a 1996 article in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, arguing that induced abortion was a risk factor for breast cancer. The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: \\"I have some doubts. I don't think the issue has been resolved. When we were talking about the conclusions, he [Brind] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper them a little bit, but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion.\\" Brind's paper was criticized in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute for ignoring the role of response bias and for a \\"blurring of association with causation.\\" The amount of attention the study received prompted a cautionary editorial by a JECH editor. With the appearance of larger studies contradicting Brind's finding, Brind failed to convince the scientific community that abortion caused breast cancer. In 2003, Brind was invited to the NCI workshop on abortion and breast cancer, where he was the only one to formally dissent from the workshop's finding that there is no link between the two. Brind blames the lack of support for his findings on a conspiracy, arguing that the NCI and other major medical organizations are engaged in a \\"cover-up\\" for the purpose of \\"protecting the abortion industry\\". Proposed mechanism Lobules are 3, ducts are 6. In early pregnancy, levels of estrogen, progesterone, and estradiol increase, leading to breast growth in preparation for lactation. Proponents speculate that if this process is interrupted by an abortion or miscarriage‚Äîbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimester‚Äîthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s. Breast tissue contains many lobes (segments) and these contain lobules which are groups of breast cells. There are four types of lobules: *Type 1 has 11 ductules (immature) *Type 2 has 47 ductules (immature) *Type 3 has 80 ductules (mature, fewer hormone receptors) *Type 4 are fully matured (cancer resistant) and contain breast milk During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules quickly become type 2 lobules because of changes in estrogen and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs in the last few months of pregnancy. According to the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies. Later on, Russo et al. found that placental human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induces the synthesis of inhibin by the mammary epithelium. Bernstein et al. independently observed a reduced breast cancer risk when women were injected with hCG for weight loss or infertility treatment. Contrary to the ABC hypothesis, Michaels et al. hypothesize since hCG plays a role in cellular differentiation and may activate apoptosis, as levels of hCG increase early on in human pregnancy, \\"an incomplete pregnancy of short duration might impart the benefits of a full- term pregnancy and thus reduce the risk of breast cancer.\\"  History  The first study involving statistics on abortion and breast cancer was a broad study in 1957 examining common cancers in Japan. The researchers were cautious about drawing any conclusions from their unreliable methodologies. During the 1960s several studies by Brian MacMahon et al. in Europe and Asia touched on a correlation between abortion and breast cancer. Their 1973 paper published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute inaccurately concluded that \\"where a relationship was observed, abortion was associated with increased, not decreased, risk.\\" Research relevant to the current ABC discussion focuses on more recent large cohort studies, a few meta-analyses, many case-control studies, and several early experiments with rats. = Rat models = Russo & Russo from the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia conducted a study in 1980 examining the proposed correlation between abortion and breast cancer. While analysing the effects of the carcinogen 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) on the DNA labeling index (DNA-LI) in terminal end buds (TEBs), terminal ducts (TDs) and alveolar buds (ABs) of Sprague-Dawley rats in various stages of reproductive development, they found that rats who had interrupted pregnancies had no noticeable increase in risk for cancer. However, they did find that pregnancy and lactation provided a protective measure against various forms of benign lesions, such as hyperplastic alveolar nodules and cysts. While results did suggest that rats who had interrupted pregnancies might be subject to \\"similar or even higher incidence of benign lesions\\" than virgin rats, there was no evidence to suggest that abortion would result in a higher incidence of carcinogenesis. A more thorough examination of the phenomenon was conducted in 1982, confirming the results. A later study in 1987 further explained their previous findings. After differentiation of the mammary gland resulting from a full-term pregnancy of the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and the cell cycle length increases, allowing more time for DNA repair. Despite the fact that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and pregnancy interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious. Epidemiological evidence The results of prospective cohort studies on the relationship between abortion and breast cancer have been consistently negative. Such studies are considered more reliable than retrospective studies and case-control studies. The positive association between abortion and breast cancer risk observed in case- control studies may be accounted for by recall bias. In 1996, Brind et al. published a meta-analysis of 23 studies which reported a positive association existed between induced abortion and breast cancer risk. The authors estimated the relative risk of breast cancer among women who had had an induced abortion to be 1.3, compared to women who had not had an abortion. It was criticized by other researchers for multiple reasons, including allegations that it failed to account for publication bias (positive studies tend to be more likely to be published). The meta-analysis was also criticized because the studies it included were almost all case-control studies, which are susceptible to recall bias, and for which it is difficult to select an appropriate control group. In 1997, Wingo et al. reviewed 32 studies on the abortion-breast cancer relationship and concluded that the results of studies on this subject were too inconsistent to allow for definitive conclusions, for either induced or spontaneous abortions. A 2004 analysis of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous abortion. The relative risk of breast cancer for women who had a spontaneous abortion in this analysis was 0.98, and that for induced abortion was 0.93. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies found insufficient evidence to support an association between induced or spontaneous abortion and an increased risk of breast cancer.  Politicization  By the late 1980s, national politicians recognized that a focus on reducing access to abortion was not a winning political strategy. Some anti-abortion activists grew more aggressive and violent in the face of political abandonment, culminating with the murder of Dr. David Gunn in 1993 and the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in 1994. With direct action discredited, anti-abortion organizations, including the National Right to Life Committee, came to the forefront of the movement. These focused on legal tactics, including lobbying against late-term abortions and access to mifepristone and demanding legislation based on the purported ABC link. More recently, anti-abortion organizations have turned to lobbying to increase obstacles to abortion, such as mandated counseling, waiting periods, and parental notification, and some feel that anti-abortion advocates treat ABC as simply another tactic in their campaign against abortion. There have been ongoing and incremental legal challenges to abortion in the United States by anti-abortion groups. In 2005, a Canadian anti-abortion organization put up billboards in Alberta with large pink ribbons and the statement: \\"Stop the Cover-Up,\\" in reference to the ABC hypothesis. The Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation was concerned by the misrepresentation of the state of scientific knowledge on the subject. The continued focus on the ABC hypothesis by anti-abortion groups has fostered a confrontational political environment. Anti-abortion advocates and scientists alike have responded with criticisms. The claims by anti-abortion advocates are sometimes referred to as pseudoscience. During the late 1990s, several members of the United States Congress became involved in the ABC issue. In a 1998 hearing on cancer research, U.S. Representative Tom Coburn accused the National Cancer Institute of misleading the public by selectively releasing data. In 1999, shortly after the House debated FDA approval of the abortion drug mifepristone, U.S. Representative Dave Weldon wrote a \\"Dear Colleague\\" letter, enclosing an article from John Kindley. In it, Weldon expressed concern that the majority of studies indicated a possible ABC link and that politicization was \\"preventing vital information from being given to women.\\" , abortion counseling materials in Alaska, Kansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas incorrectly assert a possible link between abortion and breast cancer, while Minnesota materials correctly report no link. Similar legislation requiring notification has also been introduced in 14 other states. An editor for the American Journal of Public Health expressed concern that these bills propose warnings that do not agree with established scientific findings. Bioethicist Jacob M. Appel argues that the mandatory disclosure statutes might be unconstitutional on \\"rational basis\\" grounds. Childbirth is significantly more dangerous than abortion, data that is not required in any disclosure law but which is necessary for a meaningful understanding of risks. According to Appel, \\"[i]f the roughly fifty million abortions that have occurred in the United States since Roe v. Wade had all ended in full-term deliveries, approximately five hundred additional women would have died during childbirth.\\" In May 2017, President Donald Trump appointed Charmaine Yoest, an anti-abortion activist and proponent of the abortion-breast cancer link, to the post of assistant secretary for public affairs in the Department of Health And Human Services.Trump taps anti-abortion leader Charmaine Yoest for HHS post. UPI (1 May 2017), retrieved 2 May 2017. = National Cancer Institute = The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has been a target of the anti-abortion movement for the conclusions presented on its website. A report from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform found that in November 2002 the Bush administration had altered the NCI website. The previous NCI analysis had concluded that, while some question regarding an association between abortion and breast cancer existed prior to the mid-1990s, a number of large and well- regarded studies had resolved the issue in the negative. The Bush administration removed this analysis and replaced it with the following: This alteration, which suggested that there was scientific uncertainty on the ABC issue, prompted an editorial in The New York Times describing it as an \\"egregious distortion\\" and a letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services from members of Congress. In response to the alteration the NCI convened a three-day consensus workshop entitled Early Reproductive Events and Breast Cancer on 24‚Äì26 February 2003. The workshop concluded that induced abortion does not increase a woman's risk of breast cancer, and that the evidence for this had been well established. Afterwards, the director of epidemiology research for the American Cancer Society stated, \\"[t]his issue has been resolved scientifically ‚Ä¶ This is essentially a political debate.\\" Brind was the only attendee at the workshop to file a dissenting opinion as a minority report criticizing the conclusions. He contends the workshop evidence and findings were overly controlled by its organizers and that the time allotted was too short for a thorough review of the literature. = North Dakota lawsuit = In January 2000, Amy Jo Kjolsrud (n√©e Mattson), an anti- abortion counselor, sued the Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo, North Dakota, alleging false advertising. The suit, Kjolsrud v. MKB Management Corporation, alleged that the clinic was misleading women by distributing a brochure quoting a National Cancer Institute fact sheet on the ABC hypothesis. The brochure stated: The case was originally scheduled for 11 September 2001, but was delayed as a result of the terrorist attacks. On 25 March 2002, the trial began. After four days of testimony, Judge Michael McGuire ruled in favor of the clinic. Linda Rosenthal, an attorney from the Center for Reproductive Rights characterized the decision thus: \\"[t]he judge rejected the abortion- breast cancer scare tactic. This ruling should put to rest the unethical, anti-choice scare tactic of using pseudo-science to harass abortion clinics and scare women.\\" John Kindley, one of the lawyers representing Kjolsrud stated: \\"I think most citizens, whether they are pro-choice or anti-abortion, believe in an individual's right to self-determination. They believe people shouldn't be misled and should be told about [procedural] risks, even if there is controversy over those risks.\\" Kindley also wrote a 1998 Wisconsin Law Review article outlining the viability of medical malpractice lawsuits based upon not informing patients considering abortion about the ABC hypothesis. The decision was appealed and on 23 September 2003 the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled that Kjolsrud did not have standing and affirmed the lower court ruling dismissing the action. The appeal noted that Kjolsrud \\"concedes she had not read the brochures before filing her action.\\" The appeal also noted that after the lawsuit was filed, the abortion clinic updated their brochure to the following: References External links * National Cancer Institute: Abortion, Miscarriage, and Breast Cancer Risk * Induced abortion does not increase breast cancer risk, a fact sheet from the World Health Organization * Is Abortion Linked to Breast Cancer? from the American Cancer Society * American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists: Finds No Link Between Abortion and Breast Cancer Risk The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists * Discover Magazine: The Scientist Who Hated Abortion by Barry Yeoman * Factors That Do Not Increase Risk from the Susan G.

AP Worldstream. (15 January 2004). Retrieved 5 July 2015.  Career  Scala was born as Odette Bedogni in Bracciano, Lazio, Italy. When she was a young girl, her family moved to Milan where she studied ballet at \\"La Scala\\" Ballet School for seven years.Delia Scala. Variety (20 January 2004). Retrieved 5 July 2015. She performed in numerous ballets until World War II, after which she began appearing in motion pictures using the stage name, Delia Scala. These include Difficult Years (Anni difficili, 1948), Side Street Story (Napoli milionaria, 1950), Rome 11:00 (Roma ore 11, 1952), Touchez pas au grisbi (1954), Gentlemen Are Born (Signori si nasce, 1960). In 1954 Delia made her theatre debut with Giove in doppiopetto (Double-breasted Jupiter). The show is considered the first \\"Commedia musicale\\", an italian musical genre created by playwrights Pietro Garinei and Sandro Giovannini with the collaboration of the musician and songwriter Gorni Kramer. Scala later starred in Buonanotte Bettina (Goodnight Bettina, 1956) with Walter Chiari, L'adorabile Giulio (The Adorable Giulio, 1957) with Carlo Dapporto, Un trapezio per Lisistrata (A Trapeze for Lisistrata, 1958) with Nino Manfredi and Paolo Panelli, Delia Scala Show (1960), Rinaldo in campo (Rinaldo into the Field, 1961) with Domenico Modugno, My Fair Lady (1964) with Gianrico Tedeschi and Mario Carotenuto, and Il giorno della tartaruga (The Day of the Turtle, 1965) with Renato Rascel. In 1956 Scala appeared in the TV show Lui e Lei (Him and Her, 1956) with Nino Taranto. In 1959‚Äì60 she co-hosted Canzonissima with Nino Manfredi and Paolo Panelli. After twelve consecutive years of performances in Italy and Europe, Scala began to experience fatigue. In 1965, at the height of her success (she had received offers from Broadway), she suddenly decided to drop out from live performances. In 1966 she married and temporarily retired to spend time with her family. In 1968 Scala made a comeback with Delia Scala Story, a show written by Garinei and Giovannini. This was followed in 1970 by the very successful Signore e signora (Mr. and Madame) with Lando Buzzanca. After a nine-year break, she starred in the show Che combinazione (What a Coincidence) alongside Don Lurio. From 1980 to 1983, Scala conceived and hosted the show Una rosa per la Vita (A Rose for Life) to raise funds to support cancer prevention and research at the Bussoladomani arena in Lido di Camaiore, together with Raimondo Vianello and Sandra Mondaini, . In 1982 Scala returned to television with the RAI fiction Casa Cecilia (Cecilia's Home), where she performed for three seasons. Her final TV role was in the sitcom Io e la mamma, (Mum and I) aired between 1996 and 1998 on Canale 5. Personal life Scala achieved great professional success, but her personal life was marred by misfortune and tragedy. In 1946, at the age 17, she married a Greek military officer who had come to Italy to join the partisan forces in the fight against the Nazi-fascists. They separated two years later, and she got the marriage voided in 1956. During the mid-1950s Scala was engaged with Formula One race car driver Eugenio Castellotti. He died in 1957 when his Ferrari crashed while attempting a speed record at the Modena race track. In 1967 she married Piero Giannotti.The marriage lasted until 1982 when Giannotti died of a heart attack while cycling along the beach in Viareggio. She married a third time in 1985 with industrialist Arturo Fremura. The marriage ended with her husband's death of liver cancer in 2001. In 1974 Delia Scala was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent a radical mastectomy. Although she appeared to have made a full recovery, in 2002 she was struck again with the same illness. Scala died in 2004 in Livorno, Tuscany. She rests in the Cimitero della Misericordia in Livorno. At the time of her death, Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi called her a \\"model of enthusiasm and rigorous professionalism\\" and said he rated her among \\"the most beloved and popular artists in the history of Italian entertainment\\".

Early years A sixth-grade dropout, Samples was a stock car racing driver and carpenter by trade who went on the radio at the age of 40 and told a story about catching the largest fish ever seen in his hometown. The story was a humorous tall tale, and the recording of this radio story became a best-selling novelty record, \\"You Shoulda Seen The One That Got Away\\". Hee Haw He was asked to become part of the 1969 cast of Hee Haw, and created a bumbling personality, often stumbling or slow-talking his way through delivery, messing up jokes, and forgetting lines. One sketch of the show he appeared in regularly was \\"The Culhanes of Cornfield County\\" in which Junior; Gordie Tapp; Grandpa Jones and Lulu Roman would sit on a sofa and engage in a comedic deadpan routine: for example on one episode each would talk about the new color TV set that had just been brought; but that they couldn't watch it‚Äîbecause they forgot they didn't have any electricity in the house! His five children also appeared in episodes during the early years of the show, playing the children in the \\"Schoolhouse\\" sketches, and as themselves in quickies. =BR-549= Samples's most famous bit was as a used car salesman, inviting callers to call an older five-digit phone number, BR-549 (in the show's later years, the number was changed to BR-1Z1Z). When Hee Haw episodes were later sold to the public through a TV ad, the initial 800-number was a takeoff of Samples's comedy bit.The real story of BR-549 In 1993 BR5-49 was also taken as a name by an American country music band as an homage to the skit.BR549 The Group Not many saw it on the show, but he used to have a motorcycle with training wheels. This was in the car lot sketch. Politics In 1974, Samples announced that he was \\"seriously considering\\" running for lieutenant governor of Georgia on a Republican Party ticket with then-Macon mayor Ronnie Thompson, who was seeking the party's gubernatorial nomination. The media at first presented Samples's announcement as a political story. However, Samples was pulling a practical joke for publicity purposes. Thompson remained in the race and was defeated in the general election by the Democrat George D. Busbee. Personal life and death Samples was married to Grace Carrie Bolton (April 27, 1927 ‚Äì July 9, 2015), and they had five children together. Grace occasionally used Bolden as her maiden name, and it was an official alias in legal documents. Junior, whose weight periodically neared four hundred pounds, was on Hee Haw for fourteen years, until he died of a heart attack at the age of 57 His funeral was officiated by close friend Rev. Douglas Collins.Junior SamplesObit Discography Throughout the years Samples recorded several comedy albums. Although he was known for his television appearances on Hee Haw, his recordings were often heard on radio. His first break came in 1966 with the recording of \\"The Whopper\\".Discography of Junior Samples He was nominated for two Comedian of the Year Awards from the Country Music Awards in 1969 and 1970, and made a number of other comedy albums.Samples Nominated for Comedy Award1969 Samples Nominated for Comedy Award1970 Comedy nomination * The World of Junior Samples (1967) * Bull Session at Bull's Gap (1968) * That's a Hee Haw (1970) * Junior Samples and Archie Campbell (1977) References External links Category:1926 births Category:1983 deaths Category:20th-century American comedians Category:People from Cumming, Georgia Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Republicans ","title":"Junior Samples"},{"id":"1253213","text":"Simon Spurrier is a British comics writer and novelist, who has previously worked as a cook, a bookseller, and an art director for the BBC.

The brand was used in Corby as \\"Corby's Magic Mini's\\" operated using Iveco minibuses along lettered routes around the town centre. The service commenced in 1990 under the then-separate United Counties Omnibus Company, with the purpose of revitalising the bus network in the town from the previous downfall of bus travel due to an influx of Hackney carriages. The service was operated by United Counties until the 29 November 1999, when it was incorporated into the Stagecoach group. The livery used on the vehicles was a recoloured version of the Stagecoach \\"Stripes\\" paintwork. The main bodywork was black, with the stripes being recoloured to gold. The services ran a 5-6 minute frequency, and were free on Saturdays. The brand was also used in Ayrshire for a time to compete against Ayrways in Ayr and T&E; Docherty in Irvine. The Ayr operation used minibuses and larger single-deck buses branded as Magic Mini, which were introduced in February 2004. The brand has since been dropped in Ayrshire when the competing operators withdrew their services. The Magic Mini brand was also engaged in a miniature bus war on the Black Isle to Inverness route in the Scottish Highlands with local operator Scotbus, with Stagecoach in Inverness adopting aggressive tactics such as scheduling buses five minutes before the rival operator and undercutting fares. Competition between the two operators was acrimonious, climaxing in an arson attack on Stagecoach's Inverness depot.

Developed in the context of the Cold War, it developed its name through the claim that it represented a third position between the capitalism of the Western Bloc and the communism of the Eastern Bloc. Between the 1920s and 1940s, various dissident groups presented themselves as part of a movement distinct from both capitalism and Marxist socialism. This idea was revived by various political groups following the Second World War. The rhetoric of the \\"Third Position\\" developed among Terza Posizione in Italy and Troisi√®me Voie in France; in the 1980s, it was taken up by the National Front in the United Kingdom. These groups emphasize opposition to both communism and capitalism. Advocates of Third Position politics typically present themselves as \\"beyond left and right\\" while syncretizing ideas from each end of the political spectrum, usually reactionary right-wing cultural views and radical left-wing economic views.  History  The term \\"Third Position\\" was coined in Europe and the main precursors of Third Position politics were National Bolshevism (a synthesis of far-right ultranationalism and far-left Bolshevism) and Strasserism (a radical, mass-action, worker-based, socialist form of Nazism, advocated by the \\"left-wing\\" of the Nazi Party by brothers Otto and Gregor Strasser, until it was crushed in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934). Neo-fascist, Neo-Nazi author Francis Parker Yockey had proposed an alliance between communists and fascists called Red-Brown Alliance (Red being the color of communism and Brown being the color of Nazism) which would have been anti-Semitic, anti-American, and anti-Zionist in nature. Yockey lent support to Third World liberation movements as well.  Germany  Querfront (\\"cross-front\\") was the cooperation between conservative revolutionaries in Germany with the far-left during the Weimar Republic of the 1920s. The term is also used today for mutual entryism or cooperation between left and right-wing groups. On the left, the Communists social fascism strategy focused against the Social Democrats, resulting in a stalemate and incidents of temporary cooperation with genuine fascist and ultranationalist forces. Ernst Niekisch and others tried to combine communist and anti-capitalist nationalist forces to overthrow the existing order of the Weimar Republic. He called this merger \\"National Bolshevism\\". The Chancellor, General Kurt von Schleicher, pursued a strategy of demerging the left (Strasserist) wing of the Nazi Party as a way of gaining Adolf Hitler's support for his government.Turner, Henry Ashby Hitler's Thirty Days to Power, New York: Addison-Wesley, 1996 pages 24-27. Schleicher's idea was to threaten the merger of the left-leaning Nazis and the trade unions as way of forcing Hitler to support his government, but his plan failed.Turner, Henry Ashby Hitler's Thirty Days to Power, New York: Addison-Wesley, 1996 pages 24-29.  France  During the 1930s and 1940s, a number of splinter groups from the radical left became associated with radical nationalism. Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (from the French Communist Party) and Marcel D√©at's National Popular Rally (from the French Section of the Workers' International). Third Position ideology gained some support in France, where in 1985 Jean-Gilles Malliarakis set up a \\"Third Way\\" political party, Troisi√®me Voie (TV). Considering its main enemies to be the United States, communism and Zionism, the group advocated radical paths to national revolution. Associated for a time with the Groupe Union D√©fense, TV was generally on poor terms with Front National until 1991, when Malliarakis decided to approach them. As a result, TV fell apart and a radical splinter group under Christian Bouchet, Nouvelle R√©sistance, adopted National Bolshevik and then Eurasianist views. https://www.france-politique.fr/annuaire-extreme- droite.htm#TV  Italy  In Italy, the Third Position was developed by Roberto Fiore, along with Gabriele Adinolfi and Peppe Dimitri, in the tradition of Italian neo-fascism. Third Position's ideology is characterized by a militarist formulation, a palingenetic ultranationalism looking favourably to national liberation movements, support for racial separatism and the adherence to a soldier lifestyle. In order to construct a cultural background for the ideology, Fiore looked to the ruralism of Julius Evola and sought to combine it with the desire for a cultural-spiritual revolution. He adopted some of the positions of the contemporary far-right, notably the ethnopluralism of Alain de Benoist and the Europe-wide appeal associated with such views as the Europe a Nation campaign of Oswald Mosley (amongst others). Fiore was one of the founders of the Terza Posizione movement in 1978. Third Position ideas are now represented in Italy by Forza Nuova, led by Fiore; and by the movement CasaPound, a network of far-right social centres.  United Kingdom  In the 1980s, the National Front, a British fascist party that had experienced the height of its success in the 1970s, was taken over by a Strasserist faction that referred to themselves as Third Positionist. The Strasserist-led National Front was also characterised by Baker as National Bolshevist in ideology. Reflecting the Nouvelle Droite's influence, the Strasserist Official NF promoted support for \\"a broad front of racialists of all colours\\" who were seeking an end to multi-racial society and capitalism, praising black nationalists like Louis Farrakhan and Marcus Garvey. Their publication, Nationalism Today, featured positive articles on the governments of Libya and Iran, presenting them as part of a global anti-capitalist and anti-Marxist third force in international politics; its members openly acknowledged the influence of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his Third International Theory. This may have had tactical as well as ideological motivations, with Libya and Iran viewed as potential sources of funding. This new rhetoric and ideology alienated much of the party's rank-and-file membership. It experienced internal problems, and in 1989 several of its senior members‚ÄîNick Griffin, Derek Holland, and Colin Todd‚Äîsplit from it to establish their International Third Position group. One of its leaders was Roberto Fiore, an ex-member of the Italian far-right movement Third Position.  United States  In the United States, Political Research Associates argues that Third Position politics has been promoted by some white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups such as the National Alliance, American Front, Traditionalist Worker Party, and White Aryan Resistance, as well as some black nationalist groups, such as the Nation of Islam, since the late 20th century. In 2010, the American Third Position Party (later renamed American Freedom Party) was founded in part to channel the right-wing populist resentment engendered by the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 and the policies of the Obama administration.

An Italian-born aristocrat who wrote about various political topics throughout his career, Manhattan is perhaps best remembered as the author of several works discussing the Vatican's role in world politics and global affairs. Manhattan attended both the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics. Life and career Born in Milan, Italy, on April 6, 1914, to American and Swiss/Dutch parents of Jewish extraction, Manhattan was originally known as \\"Teofilo Lucifero Gardini\\" in his early days in Italy. Before his exile, Manhattan was known to spend his summers at the home of the artist, Paolo Troubetzkoy, in Verbania. Manhattan, himself a painter, exhibited a number of his works at local Italian museums. The last of these exhibitions was at the Museo del Paesaggio, in Verbania, where two of his paintings remain to this day. Manhattan was exiled to England from Italy during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. During World War II, he operated a radio station called \\"Radio Freedom\\" broadcasting to nations occupied by the Axis Powers. Manhattan officially changed residence to the United Kingdom in 1945 for \\"political reasons,\\" but not until 1953 did Manhattan legally change his name, relinquishing the names \\"Teofilo Angelo Mario Gardini\\" and \\"Teophile Lucifer Gardini.\\" At the time, he lived in Wimbledon, London.

Life The eldest son of a distinguished Malink√© family, Ahmadou Kourouma was born in 1927 in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Raised by his uncle, he initially pursued studies in Bamako, Mali. From 1950 to 1954, when his country was still under French colonial control, he participated in French military campaigns in Indochina, after which he journeyed to France to study mathematics in Lyon. Kourouma returned to his native C√¥te d'Ivoire after it won its independence in 1960, yet he quickly found himself questioning the government of F√©lix Houphou√´t- Boigny. After brief imprisonment, Kourouma spent several years in exile, first in Algeria (1964‚Äì69), then in Cameroon (1974‚Äì84) and Togo (1984‚Äì94), before finally returning to live in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Determined to speak out against the betrayal of legitimate African aspirations at the dawn of independence, Kourouma was drawn into an experiment in fiction. His first novel, Les soleils des ind√©pendances (The Suns of Independence, 1970) contains a critical treatment of post-colonial governments in Africa. Twenty years later, his second book Monn√®, outrages et d√©fis, a history of a century of colonialism, was published. In 1998, he published En attendant le vote des b√™tes sauvages (translated as Waiting for the Wild Beasts to Vote), a satire of postcolonial Africa in the style of Voltaire in which a griot recounts the story of a tribal hunter's transformation into a dictator, inspired by president Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma of Togo. In 2000, he published Allah n'est pas oblig√© (translated as Allah is Not Obliged), a tale of an orphan who becomes a child soldier when traveling to visit his aunt in Liberia. At the outbreak of civil war in C√¥te d'Ivoire in 2002, Kourouma stood against the war as well as against the concept of Ivorian nationalism, calling it \\"an absurdity which has led us to chaos.\\" President Laurent Gbagbo accused him of supporting rebel groups from the north of the country. In France, each of Ahmadou Kourouma's novels has been greeted with great acclaim, sold exceptionally well, and been showered with prizes including the Prix Renaudot in the year 2000 and the Prix Goncourt des Lyc√©ens for Allah n'est pas oblig√©. In the English-speaking world, Kourouma has yet to make much of an impression: despite some positive reviews, his work remains largely unknown outside university classes in African fiction. Allah Is Not Obliged received its first English translation in 2006. At the time of his death, he was working on a sequel to Allah n'est pas oblig√©, entitled Quand on refuse on dit non (translated roughly as \\"When One Disagrees, One Says No\\"), in which the protagonist of the first novel, a child soldier, is demobilized and returns to his home in C√¥te d'Ivoire, where a new regional conflict has arisen.

In early 1180, Prince Mochihito, the Minamoto Clan's favored claimant to the Imperial Throne, was chased by Taira forces to the Mii-dera, a temple just outside Kyoto. Due to the interference of a Mii-dera monk with Taira sympathies, the Minamoto army arrived too late to help defend the temple. Minamoto no Yorimasa and Prince Mochihito, along with a force of about fifteen hundred men including the warrior monks of Mii-dera and the Watanabe clan, fled south towards Nara. They crossed the Uji River, just outside the By≈çd≈ç- in, and tore up the planks of the bridge behind them to prevent the Taira following them. Three warrior monks in particular are named in the Heike Monogatari: Gochi-in no Tajima, Tsutsui J≈çmy≈ç Meish≈´, and Ichirai H≈çshi. These three, along with the other monks of Mii-dera, fought with bow and arrow, a variety of swords and daggers, and naginata. As for the Taira troops, they were led by Ashikaga Tadatsuna, one of the few warriors of direct Minamoto descent who stayed loyal to his oath to the Taira family even when it was crumbling around him, until he and his father were murdered by one of their retainers, Kiry≈´ Rokur≈ç. A young hero of 18 years old, Tadatsuna is remembered as having the strength of one hundred men, a voice that echoed over 10 li (5 km), and teeth of 1 sun (3.03 cm) long. Describing it as such, Azuma Kagami further stated that \\"there will be no warrior in future ages like this Tadatsuna.\\" Led by their young general, the Taira force soon began to ford the river and caught up with the Minamoto. Tadatsuna was the first warrior on the frontline, and gallantly proclaimed his name and lineage before charging the enemies, as it was the traditional custom. Yorimasa tried to help the Imperial Prince get away, but was struck with an arrow in the right elbow. While his sons, Nakatsuna and Kanetsuna were dying to fend off the enemies eager for the old man's head, Yorimasa committed seppuku. \\"Yorimasa committed hara-kiri in a way that was to set the standard for generations to come.\\" As for Prince Mochihito, he was captured and killed shortly afterwards by the Taira warriors.

A reggae pioneer, he performed for six decades and helped establish some of the fundamentals of reggae music. Hibbert's 1968 song \\"Do the Reggay\\" is widely credited as the genesis of the genre name reggae. His band's album True Love won a Grammy Award in 2005.  Early life  Hibbert was born on 8 December 1942 in May Pen, Parish of Clarendon, Jamaica, the youngest of his siblings. Hibbert's parents were both strict Seventh-day Adventist preachers so he grew up singing gospel music in a church choir. Both parents died young and, by the age of 11, Hibbert was an orphan who went to live with his brother John in the Trenchtown neighborhood of Kingston. While working at a local barbershop, he met his future bandmates Raleigh Gordon and Jerry Matthias.  Career  = 1960s = Fredrick Nathaniel Hibbert, a multi-instrumentalist, formed Toots and the Maytals in 1961. He could play every instrument used in his bandAlbum sleeve of DJ Derek Presents‚Ä¶ Sweet Memory Sounds (2006). and would later cite Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, and James Brown as key influences. According to Hibbert, Maytals is a reference to the Rastafari term for \\"do the right thing\\". There are also statements attributing the source of the name to Hibbert's hometown of May Pen. The band was originally a trio with Gordon and Mathias, and later added Jackie Jackson and Paul Douglas. Much of Hibbert's early recorded output, such as \\"Hallelujah\\" (1963), reflects his Christian upbringing. He was also known to write about Rastafarian religious themes, and in an early Maytals song, \\"Six And Seven Books of Moses\\" (1963), he addressed the folk magic of obeah and its use of the occult literature of Biblical grimoires, such as the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses. The Maytals became one of the more popular vocal groups in Jamaica in the mid-1960s, recording with producers Coxsone Dodd, Prince Buster, Byron Lee, Ronnie Nasralla, and Leslie Kong. This success included winning Jamaica's National Popular Song Contest three times with songs Hibbert wrote: in 1966 with \\"Bam Bam\\", which won a national song competition, 1969 with \\"Sweet and Dandy\\" and 1972 with \\"Pomps & Pride\\". In 1966, Hibbert was sentenced to 18 months in prison for possession of marijuana.\\"Singing the jailhouse rock\\", Jamaica Observer, 25 November 2012. Retrieved 25 November 2012 This experience provided the inspiration for one of his best known songs, \\"54-46 That's My Number\\". Hibbert was one of the first artists to use the word \\"reggae\\" on a record, in 1968's \\"Do the Reggay\\". In his 2016 \\"The Rise of Reggae and the influence of Toots and the Maytals\\", Matthew Sherman wrote: > In the winter of 1968, the cool rocksteady beat gave way to a faster, > brighter, more danceable sound.

Music critic Lester Bangs described the album in Stereo Review as \\"perfection, the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released.\\" Chris Blackwell had a strong commitment to Toots and the Maytals, saying \\"I've known Toots longer than anybody ‚Äì much longer than Bob [Bob Marley]. Toots is one of the purest human beings I've met in my life, pure almost to a fault.\\" In 1970, the band first charted overseas with ‚ÄúMonkey Man‚Äù reaching No. 47 in Britain. Hibbert also appeared in the groundbreaking Jamaican film The Harder They Come, in which his band sings \\"Sweet and Dandy\\". The film's soundtrack included the Maytals' 1969 hit song \\"Pressure Drop\\". The Harder They Come features fellow musician and actor Jimmy Cliff in the leading role as Ivan, a character whose story resembles Hibbert's. On 1 October 1975, Toots and the Maytals were broadcast live on KMET-FM as they performed at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. This broadcast was re-mastered and released as an album entitled Sailin' On via Klondike Records. = Late 20th century = Toots and the Maytals with Dave Matthews when performing together in 1998 The band's 1980 performance at Hammersmith Palais in London was released as an album, Live, less than 24 hours after it was recorded, making it into the Guinness Book of World Records. The band released Knock Out! in 1981, after which the original Maytals trio broke. After a hiatus, Hibbert continued to tour as a solo artist. In 1988, he released a greatest hits album, Toots In Memphis, for which he earned his first Grammy nomination. Hibbert restarted his band in the mid-1990s without Gordon and Mathias. = 2000s = In 2004, Hibbert was featured in Willie Nelson's Outlaws and Angels. Hibbert carried on touring the world, and his band's True Love won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 2005. Nelson released a reggae album entitled Countryman (2005) which featured Hibbert on the song \\"I'm a Worried Man\\". Hibbert was also featured in the music video for the song, which was filmed in Jamaica. In 2006, Toots and the Maytals covered Radiohead's \\"Let Down\\" for the Easy Star All-Stars album Radiodread, a reggae version of the English rock band's OK Computer.. At the end of the year, Hibbert joined Gov't Mule for their New Year's Eve concert, documented in their Dub Side of the Mule release. In 2009, Hibbert collaborated with MCPR Music and Steel Pulse's Sidney Mills, who produced Jamaican percussionist Larry McDonald's album Drumquestra. His track is called \\"What about the Children?\\" The same year he also performed vocals with Iowa reggae band Public Property on their album Work to Do. Hibbert was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. Hibbert collaborated with the U.S. southern rock/blues group, JJ Grey & Mofro. He is featured in their song, \\"The Sweetest Thing\\", on their album, Georgia Warhorse. = 2010s = In 2011, Hibbert was featured in the documentary Reggae Got Soul: The Story of Toots and the Maytals which was airred on BBC.

In May 2013, Hibbert received a head injury after being hit by a thrown bottle during a performance at the River Rock Festival in Richmond, Virginia, U.S. forcing him to cancel several months of live shows.\\"'Time Will Tell' Says Toots\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 13 October 2013. Retrieved 13 October 2013 The bottle was thrown by William C Lewis. Lewis was facing a charge of malicious wounding, but he pleaded guilty to lesser charges. Despite Hibbert pleading in a letter to the judge, \\"He is a young man, and I have heard what happens to young men in jail. My own pain and suffering would be increased substantially knowing that this young man would face that prospect,\\" the judge gave Lewis a six-month sentence. After a three- year hiatus following the incident at the River Rock Festival, in 2016 Toots and the Maytals returned to the stage and began touring again. Hibbert's vocals appear in the Major Lazer and Bad Royale 2016 collaboration, \\"My Number\\", which samples his band's earlier song \\"54-46 That's My Number\\". On 25 July 2018, Hibbert performed on the U.S. television show The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon with Toots and the Maytals where they debuted an original song entitled \\"Marley\\" as well as performing their classic hit song \\"Funky Kingston\\" in a live performance.

By 1904, Darracq was producing more than ten percent of all automobiles in France and he sold a substantial part of his business to British investors. He became fascinated by the possibilities of a rotary valve engine, put it into production and though it became a disaster for Darracq & Cie persisted in installing it in Darracq products. He was obliged to retire in June 1912 aged 56 and after the Armistice his name was dropped from his Suresnes factory's mass-produced products. In 1906 he founded Societ√† Anonima Italiana Darracq (S.A.I.D.) in Milan, Italy, which became [Societ√†] Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili (A.L.F.A.) in 1910 and eventually Alfa Romeo. Sewing machines and cycles Born Pierre Alexandre Darracq in Bordeaux, France, of Basque parents, he trained as a draftsman at the Arsenal in Tarbes, in the Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es d√©partement. He later worked at the Hurtu factory manufacturing sewing machines, and Darracq designed a machine that won a gold medal at the 1889 Paris exhibition. He established the Gladiator Cycle Company in 1891. He sold his very successful company in 1896 for a substantial amount and for a short time went into the business of manufacturing electric cars as well as acquiring an interest in rotary engined Millet motorcycles. Automobiles He established Automobiles Darracq France in Suresnes, near Paris where he pioneered the making of the chassis from pressed steel and the use of production machinery in place of hand labor. Despite his establishing an automobile business, and having taken driving lessons in July 1896, Darracq did not like driving cars or even being driven in them. For him, it was just pursuing his interest in manufacturing and making money. By 1904, Darracq was producing more than ten percent of all automobiles in France. His company became involved with motor racing, winning a number of major races, including the 1905 and 1906 Vanderbilt Cup in the United States and twice setting a new land speed record in 1904 and 1905. Racing success raised the image of the Darracq marque so he was able to expand to England and form licensing partnerships. London In 1904 he sold his business to British investors who incorporated A Darracq and Co in which he held a substantial shareholding and was a director. He remained manager of the enterprise. The following year A Darracq and Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange but reformed for the purpose as A. Darracq and Company (1905) Limited. Thereafter financial control remained in London. Italy and Germany The company that became Alfa Romeo was founded by Darracq as Societ√† Anonima Italiana Darracq (S.A.I.D.) in 1906. It became A.L.F.A. (\\"[Societ√†] Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili\\", \\"Lombard Automobile Factory Company\\") on 24 June 1910, in Milan. Darracq raised substantial capital through share issues with Cavaliere Ugo Stella, managing director of S.A.I.D and subsequently A.L.F.A., with Adam Opel in Germany and in Vitoria in the Basque region of Spain.Museo Alfa Romeo, History Darracq rotary-valve engine After personally insisting the new 1911 model employ the Henriod rotary valve engine, Alexadre Darracq resigned. Later life and death In mid-1912, Darracq resigned, having earlier sold out to British investors, and pursued other interests including running the Casino at Deauville. After World War I, he retired to the French Riviera where he joined with Belgian investors that took over the troubled luxury Hotel Negresco in Nice. He died in 1931 at his home in Monte Carlo and was interred next to his wife Louise (1850‚Äì1920) in the family mausoleum in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

According to the Hartle‚ÄìHawking proposal, the Universe has no origin as we would understand it: the Universe was a singularity in both space and time, pre-Big Bang. However, Hawking does state \\"...the universe has not existed forever.

Technical explanation  The Hartle‚ÄìHawking state is the wave function of the Universe‚Äîa notion meant to figure out how the Universe started‚Äîthat is calculated from Feynman's path integral. More precisely, it is a hypothetical vector in the Hilbert space of a theory of quantum gravity that describes this wave function.

The precise form of the Hartle‚ÄìHawking state is the path integral over all D-dimensional geometries that have the required induced metric on their boundary. According to the theory, time, as it is currently observed, diverged from a three-state dimension after the Universe was in the age of the Planck time.John D.

Born Pierre Louis Del√¢ge to a family of modest means in Cognac. As an infant he lost the sight in one eye. At the age of 16 he went to study at Arts et M√©tiers ParisTech in Angers, graduating with an engineering degree in 1893. Delage then fulfilled his military obligation and was stationed in Algeria. Discharged in 1895, he found work with a railway company in southern France; in 1900 he moved to Paris. There he worked in the engineering and design department of a motor vehicle manufacturing concern until 1903 when he received an offer to join the fledgling Renault automobile company. Del√¢ge realized the enormous potential for the automobile as demand soon began to outstrip production. Filled with innovative ideas, in 1905 he raised enough money to open an assembly plant in a converted barn in Levallois at the outskirts of Paris. The Delage Automobile Company grew rapidly and their vehicles gained a reputation for stylish appearance and quality and as a dominant force in motor racing. The Great Depression of the 1930s took its toll and car sales plummeted. By 1935 his company was forced into liquidation, and the rights to the Delage name were auctioned to the Delahaye car company.

He helped to revive the now- ubiquitous Canon in D by Johann Pachelbel, through recording it with his Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra in 1960. (Jean-Fran√ßois Paillard made a rival, and also very popular, recording of the same piece at around the same time.) M√ºnchinger is also noted for restoring baroque traditions to the interpretation of Bach's oeuvre, his greatest musical love: moderate-sized forces, judicious ornamentation, and rhythmic sprightliness, though not on \\"period instruments\\". Born in Stuttgart, M√ºnchinger studied at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in his home city. At first, he guest-conducted often, supporting himself also with other duties as an organist and church choir director. In 1941, he became principal conductor of the Hanover Symphony, a post he held for the next two years. He held no other conducting position until the end of World War II. The year that the war ended, he founded the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra, which he built into an impressive touring ensemble; it made its Paris debut in 1949 and its American debut in San Francisco in 1953. Under his leadership the orchestra issued (for the Decca label) numerous recordings, mostly during the 1950s and 1960s, and mostly of Bach's output; these included the Brandenburg Concertos (three times), the orchestral suites, the St. Matthew Passion, the St. John Passion, the Musical Offering, and the Christmas Oratorio. Of his and the ensemble's non-Bach releases, probably the best - and certainly the most famous, other than the Pachelbel performance mentioned earlier - is that of Haydn's The Creation. In 1977, the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra became the first German ensemble to visit the People's Republic of China. M√ºnchinger retired in 1988, two years before his death. Stylistically M√ºnchinger's approach with his orchestra was rather similar to those of his somewhat younger contemporaries Raymond Leppard, Sir Neville Marriner, Claudio Scimone, and the above-mentioned Paillard, though displaying an extra element of tonal solidity (not to mention a fierce rigor during rehearsals as well as performances) which might be thought of as Teutonic. With the increased fashionability of 18th-century instruments, from the 1970s onwards, M√ºnchinger's interpretations fell dramatically from critical favor and were often dismissed as \\"pass√©\\", though he always showed himself to be a fine, tough, disciplined, and sensitive musician. There have been more profoundly imaginative German conductors than M√ºnchinger, but there have been very few who matched his consistently high standards. Further reading Holmes, John L. (1982).

It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the growth of the bacterial cell wall. Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins. It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin, but can be taken by mouth. Cefalexin can treat certain bacterial infections, including those of the middle ear, bone and joint, skin, and urinary tract. It may also be used for certain types of pneumonia, strep throat, and to prevent bacterial endocarditis. Cefalexin is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus, or Pseudomonas. Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections, such as the flu, common cold or acute bronchitis. Cefalexin can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin. However, it is not recommended in those with severe penicillin allergies. Common side effects include stomach upset and diarrhea. Allergic reactions or infections with Clostridium difficile, a cause of diarrhea, are also possible. Use during pregnancy or breast feeding does not appear to be harmful to the baby. It can be used in children and those over 65 years of age. Those with kidney problems may require a decrease in dose. Cefalexin was developed in 1967.> It was first marketed in 1969 and 1970 under the names Keflex and Ceporex, among others. Generic drug versions are available under other trade names and are inexpensive. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In 2017, it was the 102nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than seven million prescriptions. In Canada, it was the fifth most common antibiotic used in 2013. In Australia, it is one of the top 15 most prescribed medications. Medical uses A course of cefalexin capsules, commonly prescribed for infections Cefalexin can treat a number of bacterial infections including otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, bone and joint infections, pneumonia, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections. It may be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis. It can also be used for the prevention of recurrent urinary- tract infections. Cefalexin does not treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Cefalexin is a useful alternative to penicillins in patients with penicillin intolerance. For example, penicillin is the treatment of choice for respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus, but cefalexin may be used as an alternative in penicillin- intolerant patients. Caution must be exercised when administering cephalosporin antibiotics to penicillin-sensitive patients, because cross- sensitivity with beta-lactam antibiotics has been documented in up to 10% of patients with a documented penicillin allergy. =Pregnancy and breastfeeding= It is pregnancy category B in the United States and category A in Australia, meaning that no evidence of harm has been found after being taken by many pregnant women. Use during breast feeding is generally safe. Adverse effects The most common adverse effects of cefalexin, like other oral cephalosporins, are gastrointestinal (stomach area) disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions. Gastrointestinal disturbances include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, diarrhea being most common. Hypersensitivity reactions include skin rashes, urticaria, fever, and anaphylaxis. Pseudomembranous colitis and Clostridium difficile have been reported with use of cefalexin. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, trouble breathing, or red, blistered, swollen, or peeling skin. Overall, cefalexin allergy occurs in less than 0.1% of patients, but it is seen in 1% to 10% of patients with a penicillin allergy. Interactions Like other Œ≤-lactam antibiotics, renal excretion of cefalexin is delayed by probenecid. Alcohol consumption reduces the rate at which it is absorbed. Cefalexin also interacts with metformin, an antidiabetic drug, and this can lead to higher concentrations of metformin in the body. Histamine H2 receptor antagonists like cimetidine and ranitidine may reduce the efficacy of cefalexin by delaying its absorption and altering its antimicrobial pharmacodynamics. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic of the cephalosporin family. It is bactericidal and acts by inhibiting synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. As cefalexin closely resembles d-alanyl-d-alanine, an amino acid ending on the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, it is able to irreversibly bind to the active site of PBP, which is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. It is most active against gram-positive cocci, and has moderate activity against some gram-negative bacilli. However, some bacterial cells have the enzyme Œ≤-lactamase, which hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring, rendering the drug inactive. This contributes to antibacterial resistance towards cefalexin. =Pharmacokinetics= Like most other cephalosporins, cefalexin is not metabolized or otherwise inactivated in the body. The biological half-life of cefalexin is approximately 30 to 60 minutes. Society and culture It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The World Health Organization classifies cefalexin as highly important for human medicine. =Names= Cefalexin is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and Australian Approved Name (AAN), while cephalexin is the British Approved Name (BAN) and United States Adopted Name (USAN). Brand names for cefalexin include Keflex, Acfex, Cephalex, Ceporex, L-Xahl, Medoxine, Ospexin, and Torlasporin. =Cost= Cefalexin is relatively inexpensive. A seven-day course of cefalexin costs a consumer about in Canada in 2014. The wholesale cost of this amount is about . In the United States this amount costs a consumer about . In Australia, a course of treatment costs from to . In the United Kingdom the costs to the consumer is generally ¬£9. The wholesale price in the developing world is about .

It is part of a theory that attempts to combine mathematically the ideas of quantum mechanics and general relativity, a step towards a theory of quantum gravity. In this approach, time plays a role different from what it does in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, leading to the so-called 'problem of time'. More specifically, the equation describes the quantum version of the Hamiltonian constraint using metric variables. Its commutation relations with the diffeomorphism constraints generate the Bergman‚ÄìKomar \\"group\\" (which is the diffeomorphism group on-shell). Quantum gravity All defined and understood descriptions of string/M-theory deal with fixed asymptotic conditions on the background spacetime. At infinity, the \\"right\\" choice of the time coordinate \\"t\\" is determined (because the space-time is asymptotic to some fixed space-time) in every description, so there is a preferred definition of the Hamiltonian (with nonzero eigenvalues) to evolve states of the system forwards in time. This avoids all the need to dynamically generate a time dimension using the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation. Thus, the equation has not played a role in string theory thus far. There could exist a Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt-style manner to describe the bulk dynamics of quantum theory of gravity. Some experts believe that this equation still holds the potential for understanding quantum gravity; however, decades after the equation was published, completely different approaches, such as string theory, have brought physicists as clear results about quantum gravity.  Motivation and background  In canonical gravity, spacetime is foliated into spacelike submanifolds. The three-metric (i.e., metric on the hypersurface) is \\\\gamma_{ij} and given by :g_{\\\\mu u}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x^{\\\\mu}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x^{ u}=(-\\\\,N^2+\\\\beta_k\\\\beta^k)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}t^2+2\\\\beta_k\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x^k\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}t+\\\\gamma_{ij}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x^i\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x^j. In that equation the Latin indices run over the values 1, 2, 3 and the Greek indices run over the values 1, 2, 3, 4. The three-metric \\\\gamma_{ij} is the field, and we denote its conjugate momenta as \\\\pi^{kl}. The Hamiltonian is a constraint (characteristic of most relativistic systems) :\\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma}}G_{ijkl}\\\\pi^{ij}\\\\pi^{kl}-\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma}\\\\,{}^{(3)}\\\\\\\\!R=0 where \\\\gamma=\\\\det(\\\\gamma_{ij}) and G_{ijkl}=(\\\\gamma_{ik}\\\\gamma_{jl}+\\\\gamma_{il}\\\\gamma_{jk}-\\\\gamma_{ij}\\\\gamma_{kl}) is the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt metric. Quantization \\"puts hats\\" on the momenta and field variables; that is, the functions of numbers in the classical case become operators that modify the state function in the quantum case. Thus we obtain the operator :\\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{H}}=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma}}\\\\widehat{G}_{ijkl}\\\\widehat{\\\\pi}^{ij}\\\\widehat{\\\\pi}^{kl}-\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma}\\\\,{}^{(3)}\\\\\\\\!\\\\widehat{R}. Working in \\"position space\\", these operators are : \\\\hat{\\\\gamma}_{ij}(t,x^k) \\\\to \\\\gamma_{ij}(t,x^k) : \\\\hat{\\\\pi}^{ij}(t,x^k) \\\\to -i \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta \\\\gamma_{ij}(t,x^k)}. One can apply the operator to a general wave functional of the metric \\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{H}} \\\\Psi[\\\\gamma] =0 where: : \\\\Psi[\\\\gamma] = a + \\\\int \\\\psi(x) \\\\gamma(x) dx^3+ \\\\int\\\\int \\\\psi(x,y)\\\\gamma(x)\\\\gamma(y) dx^3 dy^3 +... which would give a set of constraints amongst the coefficients \\\\psi(x,y,...). This means the amplitudes for N gravitons at certain positions is related to the amplitudes for a different number of gravitons at different positions. Or, one could use the two-field formalism, treating \\\\omega(g) as an independent field so that the wave function is \\\\Psi[\\\\gamma,\\\\omega].  Derivation from path integral  The Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation can be derived from a path integral using the gravitational action in the Euclidean quantum gravity paradigm: :Z = \\\\int_{C}\\\\mathrm{e}^{-I[g_{\\\\mu u},\\\\phi]}\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{g}\\\\, \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi where one integrates over a class of Riemannian four-metrics and matter fields matching certain boundary conditions. Because the concept of a universal time coordinate seems unphysical, and at odds with the principles of general relativity, the action is evaluated around a 3-metric which we take as the boundary of the classes of four-metrics and on which a certain configuration of matter fields exists. This latter might for example be the current configuration of matter in our universe as we observe it today. Evaluating the action so that it only depends on the 3-metric and the matter fields is sufficient to remove the need for a time coordinate as it effectively fixes a point in the evolution of the universe. We obtain the Hamiltonian constraint from :\\\\frac{\\\\delta I_{EH}}{\\\\delta N}=0 where I_{EH} is the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action, and N is the lapse function, i.e. the Lagrange multiplier for the Hamiltonian constraint. The demand for this variation of our gravitational action to vanish corresponds, in fact, to the background independence in general relativity.https://javierrubioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/notes_wheeler- dewitt_talk.pdf This is purely classical so far. We can recover the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation from :\\\\frac{\\\\delta Z}{\\\\delta N}=0=\\\\int \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\delta I[g_{\\\\mu u},\\\\phi]}{\\\\delta N}\\\\right_{\\\\Sigma} \\\\exp\\\\left(-I[g_{\\\\mu u},\\\\phi]\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{g}\\\\, \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi where \\\\Sigma is the three-dimensional boundary. Observe that this expression vanishes, implying that the functional derivative also vanishes, giving us the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation. A similar statement may be made for the diffeomorphism constraint (take functional derivative with respect to the shift functions instead).  Mathematical formalism  The Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation is a functional differential equation. It is ill-defined in the general case, but very important in theoretical physics, especially in quantum gravity. It is a functional differential equation on the space of three dimensional spatial metrics. The Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation has the form of an operator acting on a wave functional; the functional reduces to a function in cosmology. Contrary to the general case, the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation is well defined in minisuperspaces like the configuration space of cosmological theories. An example of such a wave function is the Hartle‚ÄìHawking state. Bryce DeWitt first published this equation in 1967 under the name \\"Einstein‚ÄìSchr√∂dinger equation\\"; it was later renamed the \\"Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation\\". =Hamiltonian constraint= Simply speaking, the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation says where \\\\hat{H}(x) is the Hamiltonian constraint in quantized general relativity and \\\\psi\\\\rangle stands for the wave function of the universe. Unlike ordinary quantum field theory or quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a first class constraint on physical states. We also have an independent constraint for each point in space. Although the symbols \\\\hat{H} and \\\\psi\\\\rangle may appear familiar, their interpretation in the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation is substantially different from non-relativistic quantum mechanics. \\\\psi\\\\rangle is no longer a spatial wave function in the traditional sense of a complex-valued function that is defined on a 3-dimensional space-like surface and normalized to unity. Instead it is a functional of field configurations on all of spacetime. This wave function contains all of the information about the geometry and matter content of the universe. \\\\hat{H} is still an operator that acts on the Hilbert space of wave functions, but it is not the same Hilbert space as in the nonrelativistic case, and the Hamiltonian no longer determines evolution of the system, so the Schr√∂dinger equation \\\\hat{H} \\\\psi\\\\rangle = i \\\\hbar \\\\partial / \\\\partial t \\\\psi\\\\rangle no longer applies. This property is known as timelessness. The reemergence of time requires the tools of decoherence and clock operators (or the use of a scalar field). =Momentum constraint= We also need to augment the Hamiltonian constraint with momentum constraints :\\\\vec{\\\\mathcal{P}}(x) \\\\left \\\\psi \\\\right\\\\rangle = 0 associated with spatial diffeomorphism invariance. In minisuperspace approximations, we only have one Hamiltonian constraint (instead of infinitely many of them). In fact, the principle of general covariance in general relativity implies that global evolution per se does not exist; the time t is just a label we assign to one of the coordinate axes. Thus, what we think about as time evolution of any physical system is just a gauge transformation, similar to that of QED induced by U(1) local gauge transformation \\\\psi \\\\rightarrow e^{i\\\\theta(\\\\vec{r} )} \\\\psi where \\\\theta(\\\\vec{r}) plays the role of local time. The role of a Hamiltonian is simply to restrict the space of the \\"kinematic\\" states of the Universe to that of \\"physical\\" states - the ones that follow gauge orbits. For this reason we call it a \\"Hamiltonian constraint.\\" Upon quantization, physical states become wave functions that lie in the kernel of the Hamiltonian operator. In general, the Hamiltonian vanishes for a theory with general covariance or time-scaling invariance.

He studied engineering at Arts et M√©tiers ParisTech trade school in Angers, the same school later attended by Louis Del√¢ge, another automobile pioneer. For a time, Delahaye worked in Belgium at the Crail Engineering works, a company known for making steam engines for locomotives. He returned to Tours following the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. Delahaye married in 1873. In 1879, he took over the Brethon Foundry and Machine-works, a business specializing in manufacturing brick kilns and related equipment for the ceramics trade. Delahaye experimented with steam and internal combustion engines, eventually converting part of the company's production to manufacturing stationary petrol engines. In 1894, he displayed his first automobile at the first-ever Paris Motor Show. It was one of only two motorized entries. To publicize his product, Delahaye raced one of his cars in the 1896 Paris‚ÄìMarseille‚ÄìParis road race. Faced with health problems, Delahaye partnered with two industrialists from Paris, brothers-in-law Leon Desmarais and Georges Morane. By 1898, the new ownership relocated automobile production from Tours to the industrial building in the Gobelin district of Paris that Desmarais and Morane had inherited. In 1901, Delahaye's poor health forced him to step down as President. He sold his shares to his partners, and retired to the French Riviera where he died in 1905.

One such top secret operation he compromised was Operation Ivy Bells. Prior to his employment by the NSA, Pelton served in the United States Air Force. He was taught the Russian language by the Air Force and served for a time in the early 1960s in Peshawar, Pakistan as a voice intercept processing specialist. After that 15-month tour, he was transferred to National Security Agency, where he continued as a civilian employee upon discharge. Pelton filed for personal bankruptcy in 1979 and resigned from his $24,500-a-year job ($ today) with the NSA A Group. From 1980 to 1984 he held a different series of jobs, none within the intelligence community. In 1984, Pelton had faced financial difficulties as a result of increasing homeowners' taxes and a mounting series of necessary repairs on his private residence. Pelton contacted the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. on January 14, 1980 and arranged for a meeting at the embassy. The FBI had surveillance on the embassy and had tapped the phone. Therefore, it anticipated the arrival of the caller but was unable to observe him in time to determine his identity. He was debriefed by KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko and disclosed Operation Ivy Bells, an NSA and United States Navy program to surreptitiously wiretap undersea cables to monitor Soviet military communications and track Soviet submarines. On trips to Vienna in 1980 and 1983, Pelton stayed at the residence of the Soviet Ambassador to Austria and underwent debriefing sessions that sometimes lasted eight hours a day with KGB officer Anatoly Slavnov. Even though Pelton had left the NSA, he may have continued to be valuable to the Soviets as an intelligence consultant, helping them interpret data picked up from other sources. Pelton had no classified documents to offer but relied on his memory to provide information. He was paid about $37,000 by the Soviets. In 1985, Vitaly Yurchenko defected to the United States and, among other things, recalled that he had met with a former NSA analyst in 1980 and described him as red-haired. The FBI scoured through NSA personnel files until it had a pool of red-haired male analysts. They were thus able to identify Pelton's voice and began surveillance on him in October 1985, but despite bugging his car and his home, they were unable to turn up any incriminating evidence against Pelton. Therefore, the FBI decided to confront Pelton directly, playing the tape of his conversation with the Soviet embassy. Eventually Pelton revealed that he had provided answers to questions from the Soviets in return for $35,000. Pelton was tried and convicted of espionage in 1986 and sentenced to three concurrent life sentences and a $100 fine. Pelton was federal inmate number 22914-037, and was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood, a medium-security facility in Pennsylvania, but spent the last six months of his sentence in a halfway house. He was released on November 24, 2015.

It can be thought of as a hybrid of chemical etching and free abrasive polishing.Mahadevaiyer Krishnan, Jakub W. Nalaskowsk, and Lee M. Cook, \\"Chemical Mechanical Planarization: Slurry Chemistry, Materials, and Mechanisms\\" Chem. Rev., 2010, vol. 110, pp 178‚Äì204. Description Functional principle of CMP The process uses an abrasive and corrosive chemical slurry (commonly a colloid) in conjunction with a polishing pad and retaining ring, typically of a greater diameter than the wafer. The pad and wafer are pressed together by a dynamic polishing head and held in place by a plastic retaining ring. The dynamic polishing head is rotated with different axes of rotation (i.e., not concentric). This removes material and tends to even out any irregular topography, making the wafer flat or planar. This may be necessary to set up the wafer for the formation of additional circuit elements. For example, CMP can bring the entire surface within the depth of field of a photolithography system, or selectively remove material based on its position. Typical depth-of-field requirements are down to Angstrom levels for the latest 22 nm technology. Working principles =Physical action= Typical CMP tools, such as the ones seen on the right, consist of a rotating and extremely flat plate which is covered by a pad. The wafer that is being polished is mounted upside-down in a carrier/spindle on a backing film. The retaining ring (Figure 1) keeps the wafer in the correct horizontal position. During the process of loading and unloading the wafer onto the tool, the wafer is held by vacuum by the carrier to prevent unwanted particles from building up on the wafer surface. A slurry introduction mechanism deposits the slurry on the pad, represented by the slurry supply in Figure 1. Both the plate and the carrier are then rotated and the carrier is kept oscillating; this can be better seen in the top view of Figure 2. A downward pressure/down force is applied to the carrier, pushing it against the pad; typically the down force is an average force, but local pressure is needed for the removal mechanisms. Down force depends on the contact area which, in turn, is dependent on the structures of both the wafer and the pad. Typically the pads have a roughness of 50 Œºm; contact is made by asperities (which typically are the high points on the wafer) and, as a result, the contact area is only a fraction of the wafer area. In CMP, the mechanical properties of the wafer itself must be considered too. If the wafer has a slightly bowed structure, the pressure will be greater on the edges than it would on the center, which causes non-uniform polishing. In order to compensate for the wafer bow, pressure can be applied to the wafer's backside which, in turn, will equalize the centre-edge differences. The pads used in the CMP tool should be rigid in order to uniformly polish the wafer surface. However, these rigid pads must be kept in alignment with the wafer at all times. Therefore, real pads are often just stacks of soft and hard materials that conform to wafer topography to some extent. Generally, these pads are made from porous polymeric materials with a pore size between 30-50 Œºm, and because they are consumed in the process, they must be regularly reconditioned. In most cases the pads are very much proprietary, and are usually referred to by their trademark names rather than their chemical or other properties. =Chemical action= Chemical mechanical polishing or planarization is a process of smoothing surfaces with the combination of chemical and mechanical forces. It can be thought of as a hybrid of chemical etching and free abrasive polishing. Usage in semiconductor fabrication Before about 1990 CMP was viewed as too \\"dirty\\" to be included in high-precision fabrication processes, since abrasion tends to create particles and the abrasives themselves are not without impurities. Since that time, the integrated circuit industry has moved from aluminum to copper conductors. This required the development of an additive patterning process, which relies on the unique abilities of CMP to remove material in a planar and uniform fashion and to stop repeatably at the interface between copper and oxide insulating layers (see Copper interconnects for details). Adoption of this process has made CMP processing much more widespread. In addition to aluminum and copper, CMP processes have been developed for polishing tungsten, silicon dioxide, and (recently) carbon nanotubes.Awano,Y.: (2006), \\"Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Via Interconnect Technologies: Low temperature CVD growth and chemical mechanical planarization for vertically aligned CNTs\\". Proc. 2006 ICPT, 10 Limitations There are currently several limitations of CMP that appear during the polishing process requiring optimization of a new technology. In particular, an improvement in wafer metrology is required. In addition, it was discovered that the CMP process has several potential defects including stress cracking, delaminating at weak interfaces, and corrosive attacks from slurry chemicals. The oxide polishing process, which is the oldest and most used in today's industry, has one problem: a lack of end points requires blind polishing, making it hard to determine when the desired amount of material has been removed or the desired degree of planarization has been obtained. If the oxide layer has not been sufficiently thinned and/or the desired degree of planarity has not been achieved during this process, then (theoretically) the wafer can be repolished, but in a practical sense this is unattractive in production and is to be avoided if at all possible. If the oxide thickness is too thin or too non-uniform, then the wafer must be reworked, an even less attractive process and one that is likely to fail. Obviously, this method is time-consuming and costly since technicians have to be more attentive while performing this process. Application Shallow trench isolation (STI), a process used to fabricate semiconductor devices, is a technique used to enhance the isolation between devices and active areas. Moreover, STI has a higher degree of planarity making it essential in photolithographic applications, depth of focus budget by decreasing minimum line width. To planarize shallow trenches, a common method should be used such as the combination of resist etching-back (REB) and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). This process comes in a sequence pattern as follows. First, the isolation trench pattern is transferred to the silicon wafer. Oxide is deposited on the wafer in the shape of trenches. A photo mask, composed of silicon nitride, is patterned on the top of this sacrificial oxide. A second layer is added to the wafer to create a planar surface. After that, the silicon is thermally oxidized, so the oxide grows in regions where there is no Si3N4 and the growth is between 0.5 and 1.0 Œºm thick. Since the oxidizing species such as water or oxygen are unable to diffuse through the mask, the nitride prevents the oxidation. Next, the etching process is used to etch the wafer and leave a small amount of oxide in the active areas. In the end, CMP is used to polish the SiO2 overburden with an oxide on the active area.

History A modern sculpture of soldiers of Royal Staff Corps at Hythe, commemorating the construction of the canal =Origin and construction= The canal was conceived by Lieutenant- Colonel John Brown of the Royal Staff Corps of field engineers in 1804, during anti-invasion preparations, as a defensible barrier to ensure that a French force could not use the Romney Marsh as a bridgehead. It had previously been assumed that the marsh could be inundated in the event of an invasion, but Brown argued that this would take ten days to implement and would cause massive disruption in the event of a false alarm. At a meeting on 26 September 1804, the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, the Duke of York, both enthusiastically endorsed the scheme. John Rennie was appointed consultant engineer, and Pitt personally persuaded the local landowners to agree to the new canal. Construction was started at Seabrook, near Hythe in Kent on 30 October 1804. By May 1805 only six miles of the canal had been completed; William Pitt intervened and the contractors and Rennie were dismissed. The work was resumed by the Quartermaster-General‚Äôs department with Lt-Col. Brown in command. Civilian navvies dug the canal itself, while soldiers built the ramparts; up to 1,500 men were employed in the project. It was constructed in two sections: the longer section starts at Hythe and ends at Iden Lock in East Sussex; the second, smaller section, runs from the foot of Winchelsea Hill to Cliff End. The two sections are linked by the River Rother (Eastern) and River Brede. Artillery batteries were generally located every , where the canal was staggered to create a salient, allowing the guns to enfilade the next stretch of water. A military road was built on the inland side of the canal, and crossings consisted of moveable wooden bridges.Lowry, Bernard (2006), Discovering Fortifications: From the Tudors to the Cold War, Shire Publications Ltd, (p. 50) Any troops stationed or moving along the military road would have been protected by the earthen bank of the parapet, which was piled up with excavated soil. The canal was completed in April 1809 at a total cost of ¬£234,000; it was hoped that tolls for use of the waterway and road would help to defray the cost. In addition to these works, a number of Martello towers were built to protect the vulnerable sluices that controlled the water level in the canal, being towers numbers 22 to 27 and 30, three of which are still standing.Clements, Bill (2011), Martello Towers Worldwide, Pen & Sword Books Limited, =Peacetime use= Despite the fact that the canal never saw military action, it was used to try to control smuggling from Romney Marsh. Guard houses were constructed at each bridge along its length. This met with limited success because of corrupt guards. Although a barge service was established from Hythe to Rye, the canal was abandoned in 1877 and leased to the Lords of the Level of Romney Marsh. pillboxes built on the Napoleonic era rampart of the canal in 1940. =World War II= During the early stages of World War II, during preparations for a threatened German invasion, the canal was manned by 31st Independent Brigade Group, who fortified each salient with a concrete pillbox and barbed wire entanglements; numerous pillboxes survive today. In the German invasion plan, codenamed Operation Sea Lion, the paratroopers of the 7th Flieger-Division were tasked with a parachute landing to secure crossing points across the Royal Military Canal on the first day of the invasion. The canal today Rye A public path runs alongside the entire length of the canal, forming part of the longer Saxon Shore Way. Aside from being historically significant in its own right, the path passes by numerous WW II pillboxes and the unusual acoustic mirrors, the historic cinque port towns of Hythe, Winchelsea, and Rye, the 12th century St Rumwold's church, and Lympne and Camber castles. The canal is an important environmental site, and passes through several Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The Environment Agency is the navigation authority and uses the waterway to manage water levels on Romney Marsh and Walland Marsh. It is important for fish and other wildlife, including kingfishers, dragonflies, and marsh frogs.

His exclusive reports included combat coverage of the first town to fall to Sandinista rebels,David Helvarg. \\"On a mission with the Sandinistas.\\" ‚Äî Associated Press, June 19, 1979. the first delivery of U.S. gunships to El Salvador, the first visit to Contra camps in Honduras, and the last interview with Sister Ita Ford before her murder by the Salvadoran military.

After returning to California, he qualified as a private investigator, and resumed freelance writing. He wrote reports on underwater technology, articles about John Hoagland after conducting the photographer's last interview, and an interview with Jonas Salk. Helvarg became increasingly involved in television production, although he continued his freelance career. Throughout the late 1980s, his television topics were dominated by AIDS education, particularly for the Hispanic community. In the early 1990s, he began to research the conflict between the US free-market environmentalist group Wise Use and the green movement, which was eventually published as The War against the Greens in 1994. The Wise Use movement alleged that the US environmentalist group Sierra Club commissioned Helvarg to write the book as an anti-Wise Use tirade and that his sponsors also sponsored a road show to tie Wise Use to an alleged far-right terrorist network. The same article described him as \\"a private investigator\\" without mentioning his role as a journalist.Ron Arnold. 'Overcoming Ideology' in Philip D. Brick and R. McGreggor Cawley. A Wolf in the Garden: The Land Rights Movement and the New Environmental Debate (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield, 1996) A visit to Antarctica in 1999 became material for several articles and books, and a daily log was published in Slate, the online news magazine. His professional exposure to green activism and his ocean sports activities intersected in marine conservation, which became his focus. While researching his second book Blue Frontier‚ÄîSaving America's Living Seas (2001), Helvarg concluded that marine conservation needed its own focal point for activism in the United States, so he moved to Washington, D.C., and founded a lobbying organization: the Blue Frontier Campaign. He also became a member of the board of Reef Relief, a more specific marine conservation advocacy group, about which he had made a television documentary in 1994. Helvarg attracted nationwide US attention in early 2005 for a syndicated newspaper article debunking comments by conservative Christians (particularly James Dobson of the Focus on the Family) on the perceived homosexual tendencies of SpongeBob SquarePants, a cartoon character, by explaining the sexual biology of ocean life (Los Angeles Times January 26, 2005). In response to suggestions by Dobson and others that the We Are Family Foundation was exploiting popular animated characters, including SpongeBob, to promote the acceptance of homosexuality among young people, Helvarg used these incidents as a springboard to describe the \\"immorality\\" in the oceans. =Books= The Golden Shore - California's Love Affair with the Sea \\"The Golden Shore\\" (in imprint of St. Martin's) 2013. \\"Boy, I loved this book.

Saved by the Sea -- A Love Story with Fish \\"Saved by the Sea\\"(an imprint of St. Martin's) 2010. Ocean Explorer Sylvia Earle says, \\"This book has the power to change the way you think about the world, about yourself, and the future of humankind.\\" Helvarg writes what he knows about the changes in his life and our Ocean world over the last half century. \\"Rescue Warriors - The U.S. Coast Guard, America's Forgotten Heroes\\" (St. Martin's 2009) Robert Kennedy Jr. says, \\"David Helvarg's terrific new book takes you to the cutting edge of adventure as he rides along with the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard.

The War against the Greens Helvarg's book The War against the Greens (1994) describes organized opposition to the environmental movement in the United States. He investigated the Wise Use movement, which he characterizes as a network of anti- environmentalist groups. Wise Use aims to facilitate extensive use of natural resources and to privatize the National Park Service. The first edition explored the origins of the organization in 1988 and its covert support by the administration of U.S. President George H.W. Bush. Helvarg identified its funding and the multinational corporations and other powerful figures with which it was associated. He catalogued the use of violence that he believed to be organized by the movement against environmental activists, and the ineffective response of law-enforcement agencies. A revised edition published in 2004 extended this to cover the early years of President George W. Bush's administration. Wisconsin Stewardship Network News described it as a book that \\"provides a fascinating and frightening insight into the violent fringe of the anti-conservation Wise Use movement [‚Ä¶ and recommends it] in its entirety to readers who want a detailed examination of the origins, development and violent tendencies of Wise Use.\\" The opposing view was put by Jesse Walker who, reviewing the book for American Enterprise, wrote that it \\"offers environmentalists a conspiracy theory to account for the populist backlash against their movement\\". Helvarg had accused Wise Use of astroturfing; Walker described his book as \\"a weapon in a propaganda war\\". War against the Greens is widely cited by activists inside the environmental movement (for example Community Rights CounselCommunity Rights Counsel: The Takings Project and Land Tenure CenterLTC 157 ) and gave rise to numerous rebuttals from Wise Use and its supporters (including Ron Arnold). Blue Frontier‚ÄîDispatches from America's Ocean Wilderness Helvarg's second book, Blue Frontier‚Äî Dispatches from America's Ocean Wilderness (2001, revised 2006), was named on the Los Angeles Times \\"Best Books of 2001\\" republished in 2006. In it Helvarg explores the effects of human activity in general, and of commerce and policy in particular, on marine life. He postulates a trend towards destruction, and suggests that it is possible to reverse this. He then describes some of the people and groups that are working to preserve or enhance the marine environment. This book prompted Senator John Kerry to observe that \\"David Helvarg underscores the full measure of the challenges before us: If we hope to explore the Blue Frontier, we must travel cautiously, repairing the damage we have done, understanding before we exploit, and always preserving the natural systems that have created it.\\" It was also one of the catalysts for the establishment of the Blue Frontier Campaign and has become a definitive text for US marine conservation (characterized as 'the Seaweed rebellion'). The Ocean and Coastal Conservation Guide Helvarg is the editor of Blue Frontier Campaign's first major publication: The Ocean and Coastal Conservation Guide (2005), a directory for those interested in the protection and restoration of United States coastal lands and waters. Blue Frontier Campaign plans to publish a new edition of the guide every two years. This reference book lists over 2,000 organizations involved in the conservation of the oceans and coastal areas that border the United States. Each entry includes contact information and a brief description of that organization's activities. The directory is divided into four listings: a geographical listings of groups; relevant government agencies; academic marine programs; and marine and coastal parks, and protected areas. Feeling the Heat Helvarg contributed two chapters to Feeling the Heat‚ÄîReports from the Frontlines of Climate Change (2004): Chapter Eight 'Australia, Florida and Fiji: Reefs At Risk' and Chapter 10 'Antarctica: The Ice is Moving' are about threatened ecosystems. The book is a development of a suite of articles that appeared in the October/November 2000 edition of E/The Environmental Magazine. The publishers \\"aimed to move beyond the scientific debate [‚Ä¶] to document [‚Ä¶] the evidence for a changing climate\\". Each chapter is a first person account of places threatened by global warming. According to Helvarg, warming waters are killing the world's coral and threatening the extinction of Australia's Great Barrier Reef and the reefs around the Florida Keys, while the rising waters threaten to engulf the entire ocean nation of Fiji. In Antarctica he observed scientists measuring the krill population and concludes that the reduction that they found is a consequence of increased water temperatures. =Broadcasting= Helvarg has produced more than 40 television documentaries broadcast by PBS, The Discovery Channel, and others. His 1986 documentary Sex Inc. was the highest rating show broadcast on the San Francisco PBS station KQED. Other documentaries focused on the military, politics, health and environmental topics. He is a commentator for the National Public Radio station Public Radio International's program Marketplace. His first documentaries drew upon his experiences as a war correspondent in Northern Ireland and Central America. When he moved to San Francisco he was commissioned to produce programs about AIDS awareness for the Hispanic community and these led to other documentaries about Hispanic health. In 1989 Globe TV commissioned a program about Greenpeace to coincide with the launch of the new Rainbow Warrior vessel. This brought Helvarg into contact with green activists, with whose cause he found he sympathized. He would return to green themes in 1991 and 1992 but in the meantime he continued to make series about health, and topical news. From 1992 onwards his energies were focussed on environmental programming with some health commissions. As of 2005 he continues to plan a series of documentaries about ocean stewardship to support the work of the Blue Frontier Campaign. =Blue Frontier Campaign= In 2003 Helvarg founded the marine conservation activist organization Blue Frontier Campaign, of which he became the president. Originally entitled the \\"Ocean Awareness Project\\", the Campaign has established a nationwide network of grassroots lobbyists. It is campaigning for an American Oceans Act to protect what the members call \\"our public seas\\" and is working to improve local, state, federal and global policies on marine conservation. Helvarg writes articles and books on its behalf. He edited the 2005‚Äì2006 Ocean and Coastal Conservation Guide and (with Philippe Cousteau and 'Sherman's Lagoon' cartoonist Jim Toomey, the book, '50 Ways to Save the Ocean' and has organized several conferences: in Washington, D.C. in July 2004 and March 2009 and at the National Aquarium in Baltimore in April 2005 and San Francisco in 2005. These conferences brought together activists, academics, officials, and politicians in a series of seminars. The Campaign is based in Washington, D.C., and the San Francisco Bay Area where Helvarg lives. Awards Helvarg won his first national award in 1988 when he won an Emmy for community service in recognition of his work on AIDS Lifeline, a networked television AIDS awareness campaign. His subsequent awards include two National Association for Interpretation awards for Interpretive Communications (in 1989 and 1991), the Nike Earthwrite Award (1997), a National Health Information Award (1999) and a CINE Golden Eagle Award (1999). In 2005, Coastal Living magazine gave him their Leadership Award. In 2007 he won the Herman Melville Award.

The fish is found primarily in the Caspian Sea, the world's largest salt-water lake, which is bordered by Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. It can also be found in the Black Sea basin and occasionally in the Adriatic Sea. Beluga caviar is the most expensive type of caviar, with market prices, at the beginning of the millennium, ranging from . Harvesting The Beluga sturgeon is currently considered to be critically endangered, causing the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to ban in 2005 the importation of beluga caviar which originated in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea basin. In 2006, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) suspended all trade made with the traditional caviar-producing regions of the Caspian and Black Seas (Beluga, Ossetra and Sevruga), (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine) due to the producing countries' failure to apply international regulations and recommendations. Caviar from Iran is exempted from the ban. Iran is considered by CITES to practice effective conservation and policing of its fisheries. In January 2007, this ban was partly lifted, allowing the sale of 96 tons of caviar, 15 percent below the official 2005 level. CITES maintained the 2007 quotas for 2008, drawing criticism for doing little to protect the declining sturgeon population. The beluga sturgeon can take up to 20 years to reach maturity. The fish harvested for caviar are often nearly . The eggs themselves are the largest of the commonly used roes, and range in color from dark gray (almost black) to light gray, with the lighter colors coming from older fish, and being the most valued. The most expensive caviar is beluga-albino caviar often called \\"Almas\\". Almas is a golden caviar produced from the eggs of a very rare female albino sturgeon between 60 and 100 years old, which swims in the southern Caspian Sea near Iran where apparently less pollution exists.\\"Most expensive caviar\\", Guinness World Records. Very few of the albino variety are left in the wild since the lack of melanin is a genetic disorder that only affects a few members of the species. A kilogram (2 lb 3 oz) of this almost white \\"black gold\\" caviar is regularly sold for ¬£20,000 (USD 25,500). Any additions by producers diminish the value of the roe, and the caviar usually reaches the market without any additions or processing whatsoever. Legality In 2005, the United States made it illegal to import beluga caviar and beluga sturgeon into the country, because of the animal's endangered status. However, caviar from beluga hybrid species are still for sale in the country. Many other countries allow for the import and export of beluga sturgeon caviar, as the fish has started making a comeback in recent years. Widespread farming and conservation efforts have allowed wild populations in the Caspian to redevelop. Service As with most caviars, beluga is usually handled with a caviar spoon made of mother of pearl, bone, or other nonmetallic material, as metal utensils tend to impart an unwelcome metallic taste to the delicate roe. Beluga caviar is usually served by itself on toast, unlike other less expensive caviars that can be served in a variety of ways, including hollowed and cooked new potatoes, on a blini, or garnished with sour cream, cr√®me fra√Æche, chopped onions, or minced hard boiled egg whites. These items can, however, be served with beluga as palate cleansers.

Early life Boyce is the son of Noreen Boyce (n√©e Hollenbeck) and former McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Corporation, Director of Security, Charles Eugene Boyce. Along with his three brothers and five sisters, Boyce was reared in Southern California, in the affluent community of Rancho Palos Verdes, a suburb southwest of Los Angeles. In 1974, Boyce was hired at TRW, an aerospace firm in Redondo Beach, California. Due to his father's prestigious position at McDonnell Douglas, Boyce was able to obtain employment. Espionage Within months, Boyce was promoted to a highly sensitive position in TRW's \\"Black Vault\\" (classified communications center) with a top secret security clearance, where he worked with National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) transmissions.Pilger, John, A Secret Country, Vintage Books, London, 1992, , pp. 212-15, 230, 236, 252. Boyce claims that he began getting misrouted cables from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) discussing the agency's desire to depose the government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in Australia. Boyce claimed the CIA wanted Whitlam removed from office because he wanted to close U.S. military bases in Australia, including the vital Pine Gap secure communications facility, and withdraw Australian troops from Vietnam. For these reasons some claim that U.S. government pressure was a major factor in the dismissal of Whitlam as Prime Minister by the Governor General, Sir John Kerr, who according to Boyce, was referred to as \\"our man Kerr\\" by CIA officers. Through the cable traffic Boyce saw that the CIA was involving itself in such a manner, not just with Australia but with other democratic, industrialized allies. Boyce considered going to the press, but believed the media's earlier disclosure of CIA involvement in the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat had not changed anything for the better. Instead, he gathered a quantity of classified documents concerning secure U.S. communications ciphers and spy satellite development and had his friend Andrew Daulton Lee, a cocaine and heroin dealer since his high school days (hence his nickname, \\"The Snowman\\") deliver them to Soviet embassy officials in Mexico City, returning with large sums of cash for Boyce (nicknamed \\"The Falcon\\" because of his longtime interest in falconry) and himself. According to a book that Boyce and his wife co-authored, the information was not valuable to the Soviet Union. Exposure Boyce, then 23, was finally exposed after Lee was arrested by Mexican police in front of the Soviet embassy on 6 January 1977. His arrest was \\"almost by accident\\": Lee was arrested for littering. During his harsh interrogation, Lee, who had top secret microfilm in his possession when arrested, confessed to being a Soviet spy and implicated Boyce. Boyce was arrested on 16 January 1977, when the FBI found him hiding out at the shack he was renting near Riverside, California. He was convicted 14 May 1977, of espionage and sentenced to 40 years in prison, initially at Terminal Island and then the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego. On 10 July 1979, he was transferred to the federal penitentiary in Lompoc, California. Escape On 21 January 1980, Boyce escaped from Lompoc.US Marshals Service - Capture of Christopher Boyce While a fugitive, Boyce carried out 17 bank robberies in Idaho and Washington, hoping to pay for passage to the Soviet Union, and adopted the alias of \\"Anthony Edward Lester.\\"\\"He needed money, and he found banks an easy mark. He hit a dozen of them throughout the Pacific Northwest, hoping to pay for passage to the Soviet Union. He would have friends there, he thought. He would be safe. But these would be mere flights of fancy.\\" https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-mar-02-tm-boyce9-story.html According to Boyce, he studied aviation, not to flee to the Soviet Union as some suspected, but to rescue Daulton Lee from Lompoc. On 21 August 1981, Boyce was arrested while eating in his car outside \\"The Pit Stop,\\" a drive-in restaurant in Port Angeles, Washington, by U.S. Marshals. Authorities had received a tip about Boyce's whereabouts from his former bank robbery confederates. Return to prison In the spring of 1982, Boyce appeared before Judge Harold Ryan in U.S. District Court in Boise and was sentenced to three years for his escape and to 25 years for bank robbery, conspiracy, and breaking federal gun laws.

After this he received a bashing from fellow inmates which he believed was orchestrated by prison guards. After the attack, he was transferred to USP Marion, where he was held in isolation. In April 1985, Boyce gave testimony on how to prevent insider spy threats to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations as part of its Government Personnel Security Program.Christopher Boyce Testimony, NOIR for USAhttps://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP09T00993R000100100008-4.pdf In 1988, with support from senators, he was transferred, out of solitary confinement, to Minnesota Correctional Facility ‚Äì Oak Park Heights. He was transferred to ADX Florence in Colorado in 1998; in his opinion, this was punishment for a newspaper article that he had written. In 2000, he was transferred to FCI Sheridan in Oregon, northwest of Salem. Release and subsequent life Boyce was released from prison on parole on 16 September 2002 after serving a little over 25 years, accounting for his time spent outside from the escape.U.S. spy freed after 25 years in prison / Christopher Boyce sold secrets to Soviets. Chuck Squatriglia, San Francisco Chronicle, 15 March 2003.The Falcon and the Fallout, Richard A. Serrano, Los Angeles Times, 23 June 2007. Shortly thereafter he married Kathleen Mills, whom he had met when she was working as a paralegal spearheading efforts to obtain parole for Lee. After her success with Lee, she turned her attention to securing parole for Boyce as well, and the two developed a personal relationship. Boyce is also on good terms with his father and eight siblings, and his mother, until her death in 2017. In 2013, Boyce published a book titled American Sons: The Untold Story of the Falcon and the Snowman, which mainly discusses his time in prison and relationship with his wife, Kathleen, and writer Vince Font. At that time, he was living a relatively quiet life where he has resumed his participation in falconry as a frequent pastime. When interviewed at the time his book was released, Boyce expressed support for the actions of Edward Snowden in exposing information about the United States government's surveillance programs. In popular culture The story of their case was told in Robert Lindsey's best-selling 1979 book The Falcon and the Snowman. This book was turned into a film of the same title in 1985 by director John Schlesinger starring Timothy Hutton as Boyce and Sean Penn as Lee. Lindsey's initial book was followed by The Flight of the Falcon: The True Story of the Escape and Manhunt for America's Most Wanted Spy (1983), an account of Boyce's escape from prison and subsequent bank robbing spree.

It was developed in the 1960s and fielded in the 1970s, and has been upgraded several times with the latest electronics. It constituted a cornerstone of the air defence of the German Army (Bundeswehr) and a number of other NATO countries. In Germany, the Gepard was phased out in late 2010 and replaced by Wiesel 2 Ozelot Leichtes Flugabwehrsystem (LeFlaSys) with four FIM-92 Stinger or LFK NG missile launchers. A variant with the MANTIS gun system and LFK NG missiles, based on the GTK Boxer, was also considered. Description A Gepard firing at the German army's Hohwacht Bay training area (1987) The vehicle is based on the hull of the Leopard 1 tank with a large fully rotating turret carrying the armament‚Äîa pair of 35 mm Oerlikon KDA autocannons and the two radar dishes‚Äîa general search radar at the rear of the turret and the tracking radar, and a laser rangefinder, at the front between the guns. Each gun has a firing rate of 550 rounds/min. The guns are 90 calibres () long, with a muzzle velocity of (FAPDS‚ÄîFrangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot rounds), giving an effective range of 5,500 m. The KDA autocannon can take two different ammunition types; the usual loading is a mix of 320 AA and 20 AP rounds per gun. Combined rate of fire is 1,100 rounds/min. The electrically driven turret is powered by a 40 kW generator driven by a 4-cylinder, 3.8 litre Mercedes-Benz OM 314 multi-fuel engine. Since the eighties, Stinger teams have been accompanying the Gepard units to take advantage of their long-range scanning capacity. To combine this capacity in a single unit, a missile system upgrade that mounts the NATO ManPad Stinger surface-to-air missile (in twin packs) to the autocannons was developed. The system was tested by the German Bundeswehr but not bought due to budget restrictions and the fielding of the Ozelot Light Flak System (LeFlaSys). The Gepard was developed from 1963 onwards. In 1969, construction began of four A prototypes testing both 30 and 35 mm guns. On 25 June 1970, it was decided to use the 35 mm type. In 1971, twelve second phase B prototypes were ordered; the same year the Dutch army ordered a CA preseries of five vehicles based on a parallel development that had used a German 0-series Leopard 1 vehicle made available by the German government in March 1970 as the C-prototype. The Germans made a small preseries of both the B1and B2R. On 5 February 1973, the political decision was made to produce the type; in September 1973 the contract was signed with Krauss-Maffei for 432 B2 turrets and 420 hulls with a total value of DM1,200,000,000. Each vehicle would thus be about three times the price of a normal Leopard 1. The first was delivered in December 1976. Belgium ordered 55 vehicles, which were identical to the German version. The Dutch ordered 95 vehicles, split into three batches (CA1, CA2 and CA3), which were equipped with Philips radar systems.  Technology and systems  = Chassis and propulsion = The Gepard is based on a slightly modified chassis of the Leopard 1 main battle tank, including the complete drive unit with a 37.4-liter 10-cylinder multi-fuel engine (type: MB 838 CaM 500) with two mechanical superchargers built by MTU. The V-engine with a cylinder angle of 90 degrees has 610 kW at 2200 RPM (830 PS) and consumes, depending on the surface and driving style, around 150 liters per 100 kilometers. To ensure a steady supply of oil, even in difficult terrain and under extreme skew, the engine is provided with a dry sump forced lubrication. Even the gearbox (type: 4 HP-250) from ZF Friedrichshafen and the exhaust system with fresh air admixture to reduce the infrared signature were taken from the Leopard 1 MBT. The Gepard is also equipped with a Daimler-Benz (type: OM 314) 4-cylinder diesel auxiliary engine for the energy supply system. This engine is on the front left of the vehicle, located where the Leopard 1 has an ammunition magazine. The engine, which has a 3.8 liter capacity, is designed as a multi-fuel engine and produces 66 kW (90 PS). It consumes, depending on the operational status of the tank, between 10 and 20 liters per hour (l/h). The auxiliary engine is coupled with five generators to operate at different speeds: Two Metadyn machines in tandem with a flywheel (which is used to store energy during the acceleration and deceleration of the turret) for the power of the elevation and traverse drives, two 380-Hz three-phase generators with a capacity of 20 kVA for the ventilation, fire control and radar systems, and a 300-A 28-volt direct current generator for the electrical system. The fuel capacity is 985 liters, which ensures a combined operating time of approximately 48 hours. The chassis and the track were taken directly from the Leopard 1. It has torsion bar spring mounted roadwheels with seven roadwheel pairs per side. They are connected to the torsion bars on swing arms, whose deflection is limited by volute springs. Drive is through the drive sprockets located at the rear. The Rubber-mounted shocks were modified to achieve better stability during firing. The track is manufactured by the company Diehl, rubber track pads fitted, and is \\"live\\" track with rubber bushings between the track links and pins (type: D 640 A). Grouser/icecleats can replace the rubber pads on some track links to increase traction on slippery surfaces. The hull only had slight modifications, i.e. a modified roadwheel distance (8 cm increased distance between the third and fourth roadwheel) and the transfer of additional batteries in battery boxes at the rear. The batteries and the electrical system operate at 24 volts DC. Variants Closeup of the gun muzzle and the projectile velocity sensor There are two variants of Gepard in service; the Dutch has a different radar installation. *Search radar: S band, 15 km range *Tracking radar: Ku band, 15 km range *Laser rangefinder *Search radar: X band, 15 km range *Tracking radar: X/Ka band, 13 km range The Dutch version was officially called the PRTL (PantserRupsTegenLuchtdoelen translating to \\"ArmourTrackAgainstAirtargets\\"), pronounced as \\"pruttel\\" (meaning 'to sputter') by the soldiers. The Dutch series version was made public through a photograph of a vehicle from a C-Company, the first to be equipped with the new weapon. Traditionally all Dutch vehicles in a company have names beginning with the company designation letter and this vehicle happened to have the individual name Cheetah painted in bold type on its turret. Inevitably the international press assumed \\"Cheetah\\" was the Dutch name for their Gepard version and this mistake found its way into most armour publications on the subject. In 2000 the Dutch military authorities, tired of constantly having to explain all this and considering \\"pruttle\\" was hardly a martial name anyway, conformed themselves to common error and made \\"Cheetah\\" the official designation, when the system was upgraded.

He served eight different emperors in his long career, holding posts such as hy≈çgo no kami (head of the arsenal). He was also a warrior, leading the Minamoto armies at the beginning of the Genpei War. In the clashes between the Minamoto and Taira clans that had gone on for decades, Yorimasa had tried to stay out of politics, and avoided taking sides. He did participate in the Hogen Rebellion in 1156. For a time, he was even friends with Taira no Kiyomori. During the Heiji Rebellion of 1160, he leaned just enough in favor of the Taira that it allowed them to overthrow the Minamoto. However, by the time he officially retired from military service in Kiyomori's army in 1179, Yorimasa had changed his mind about opposing his own clan. He entered the Buddhist priesthood. In May 1180, he sent out an appeal to other Minamoto leaders, and to temples and monasteries that Kiyomori had offended. In the Genpei War, which began with the Battle of Uji in 1180, Yorimasa led Minamoto forces, along with warrior monks from Mii-dera, in defending By≈çd≈ç- in. Despite the monks' having torn up the planks of the bridge leading to the temple, the Taira managed to break through the defenses, and take the temple. Suffering defeat at Uji, he committed suicide at By≈çd≈ç-in. Minamoto no Yorimasa's ritual suicide by seppuku may be the earliest recorded instance of a samurai's suicide in the face of defeat, although Minamoto no Tametomo, who died in 1170, ten years before Yorimasa, may hold this distinction. According to legend, after his death a retainer took Yorimasa's head to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Taira. He then fastened it to a rock and threw it into the Uji River so it could not be found. Yorimasa's daughter was the poet Nij≈çin no Sanuki. Poetry In a famous episode in the Taiheiki: > Samidare ni sawabe no makomo mizu koete/izure ayame to hikizo wazurau The > fifth-month rains swamp the water-oats along the shore, making it hard to > tell irises from one another and pull just one \\"So, Yorimasa not only added to his reputation as an archer by shooting down a nue; he also proved himself a distinguished poet by winning with a single poem Lady Ayame, whom he had adored for years and months.\\" Yorimasa's death poem was: > umoregi no/hana saku koto mo/nakarishi ni/mi no naru hate zo/kanashikarikeru > Like a fossil tree From which we gather no flowers Sad has been my life > Fated no fruit to produce  See also  * Seiwa Genji References  External links  * Category:Minamoto clan Category:Seppuku Category:1106 births Category:1180 deaths Category:People of Heian-period Japan Category:Heian period Buddhist monks Category:Suicides by sharp instrument in Japan Category:12th-century Japanese poets Category:Deified Japanese people ","title":"Minamoto no Yorimasa"},{"id":"1253407","text":"Media Television was a Canadian television newsmagazine series, which aired weekly on Citytv from 1991 to 2004.

It was founded in Majorca, Spain, by a group of laymen in 1944, while they were refining a technique to train pilgrimage Christian leaders. Description Cursillo is the original three- day movement, and has since been licensed for use by several mainline Christian denominations, some of which have retained the trademarked \\"Cursillo\\" name, while others have modified its talks/methods and given it a different name. In the United States, Cursillo is a registered trademark of the National Cursillo Center in Jarrell, Texas. The Cursillo focuses on showing Christian laypeople how to become effective Christian leaders over the course of a three-day weekend. The weekend includes fifteen talks, called rollos, which are given by priests and by laypeople. The major emphasis of the weekend is to ask participants to take what they have learned back into the world, on what is known as the \\"fourth day.\\" The method stresses personal spiritual development, as accelerated by weekly group reunions after the initial weekend. History Cursillos first appeared in Spain in 1944. A layman named Eduardo Bonn√≠n and group of close collaborators started celebrating them on different places on Majorca at about one per year. When endorsed by the bishop in 1949, it picked up strength and began spreading to Spain and the rest of the world, to the point that it became an active renewal movement in the Church. In 1957, the movement had spread to North America, when the first American cursillo was held in Waco, Texas. In 1959, the Cursillo spread throughout Texas and to Phoenix, Arizona. In August of that year, the first national convention of spiritual directors was held, and Ultreya magazine began publication. In 1960, growth of the Cursillo quickened in the American Southwest, and weekends were held for the first time in the East in New York City and Lorain Ohio. Until 1961, all weekends were held in Spanish. That year the first English-speaking weekend was held in San Angelo, Texas. Also in 1961, first weekends were held in San Francisco, California; Gary, Indiana; Lansing, Michigan; Guaynabo, Puerto Rico; and Gallup, New Mexico. In 1962, the Cursillo Movement came to the Eastern United States. Weekends were held in Cincinnati, Brooklyn, Saginaw, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Newark, Baltimore, Grand Rapids, Kansas City and Boston. In the West, the first weekends were held in Monterey, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Pueblo and Yakima. The movement spread rapidly with the early centers carrying the Cursillo to nearby dioceses. By 1981, almost all of the 160 dioceses in the United States had introduced the Cursillo Movement. The Cursillo Movement in the United States was organized on a national basis in 1965. A National Secretariat was formed and the National Cursillo Office (currently in Jarrell, Texas) was established. It is joined to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops through an official liaison in the person of Bishop Emeritus Carlos A. Sevilla S.J. from the Diocese of Yakima, and through the Bishops' Secretariat for the Laity in Washington, D.C. The spiritual advisor for the movement in the United States is Rev. Alex Waraksa from the Diocese of Knoxville, Tennessee. In 1980, the Cursillo Movement established a worldwide international office, the OMCC (Organismo Mundial de Cursillos de Cristiandad). The international office is located in Portugal for the 2014‚Äì2017 term. Today, Cursillo is a worldwide movement with centers in nearly all South and Central American countries, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Great Britain, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Austria, Australia, New Zealand Aotearoa, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and in several African countries. The movement is recognized by the Holy See as member of the International Catholic Organizations of the Pontifical Council for the Laity in Rome. De Colores In the Cursillo movement, being \\"in colors\\" is to be in God's grace. For that reason, Cursillo participants (cursillistas) greet each other with the phrase \\"De Colores\\" (in Colors). A story from the early days of the movement in Spain tells of an occasion where a group of men were returning from a Cursillo weekend when their bus broke down. They began to sing De Colores, a traditional folk song. The use of the song in Cursillo took hold, and has held up as the movement has spread outside the Spanish-speaking world and to other denominations. The use of a multi-colored rooster as a symbol for the Cursillo movement is believed to have originated from one of the verses of that song. Use by other Christian denominations This retreat is also used by Episcopalian/Anglican Cursillo, Presbyterian Cursillo/Pilgrimage, Lutheran Via de Cristo, Mennonite Way of Christ, The United Methodist Church‚Äôs Walk to Emmaus [6], and various interdenominational communities as Tres D√≠as. Analogous retreats The Cursillo method is used by ACTS,. Encounter, Antioch, Search, Awakening (college students), Cum Christo, DeColores (adult ecumenical), the Great Banquet, Happening, The Journey (United Church of Christ), Kairos Prison Ministry, Kairos (for older teenagers), Emmaus in Connecticut (for high school age teens), Gennesaret (for those living with a serious illness), Koinonia, Lamplighter Ministries, Light of Love, LOGOS (Love Of God, Others, and Self) (Lutheran teen), Teens Encounter Christ (teen ecumenical), Residents Encounter Christ (REC) (a jail/prison ministry), Tres Dias, Unidos en Cristo, Via de Cristo (Lutheran Adult),.

A derivative retreat for Catholics is called \\"Christ Renews His Parish.\\" It is a 2-day retreat, normally Saturday and Sunday, and therefore does not qualify for the term \\"cursillo\\" meant to apply to a 3-day retreat. Another derivative movement called 'Emmaus' was developed from the Cursillo at a Catholic parish in Miami, Florida, and has made some inroads. Its 3-day format borrows significantly from the Cursillo manual, but is primarily focused on the parish and not on the 'environments' of the world. Emmaus also has no formal method of '4th day' continuity such as the Cursillo 'friendship groups' and 'service sheets' to keep members accountable in their practice of the method.

It is the federal Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the U.S. Air Force, consisting of commissioned officers and enlisted airmen. AFRC supports the Air Force mission to defend the United States through the control and exploitation of air by supporting Global Engagement. AFRC also plays an integral role in the day-to-day Air Force mission and is not strictly a force held in reserve for possible war or contingency operations. Air Force Reserve Command also supports the United States Space Force through the 310th Space Wing, pending the creation of a space reserve component.  Overview  The federal reserve component of the United States Air Force, AFRC has approximately 450 aircraft assigned for which it has sole control, as well as access to several hundred additional active duty USAF aircraft via AFRC \\"Associate\\" wings that are collocated with active duty Air Force wings, sharing access to those same active duty Air Force aircraft. The inventory, both AFRC-controlled and active duty Regular Air Force-controlled, includes the latest, most capable models of aircraft that are assigned to the U.S. Air Force. On any given day, 99 percent of AFRC's aircraft are mission-ready and able to deploy within 72 hours. In addition to flying units, AFRC has numerous ground organizations ranging from medical units to civil engineers, intelligence, and security forces, just to name a few. The purpose of the Air Force Reserve, as derived from Title 10 of the United States Code (Title 10 U.S.C.), is to: > \\"Provide combat-ready units and individuals for active duty whenever there > are not enough trained units and people in the Regular component of the Air > Force to perform any national security mission.\\" Unlike the Air National Guard, which alternates between a \\"state\\" status and a \\"federal\\" status via both Title 32 of the United States Code (Title 32 U.S.C.) and Title 10 U.S.C., the Air Force Reserve is strictly a \\"federal\\" reserve component under Title 10 U.S.C. and operates as an independent Major Command (MAJCOM), i.e., Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). In combination with the Air National Guard, the Air Force Reserve comprises half of what is known as the Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the United States Air Force. AFRC forces are under the administrative control (ADCON) of the Commander, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC/CC). When activated or mobilized (e.g., under 10 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12304a, or 12304b), combatant command authority (COCOM) transfers to the combatant commander to which the forces are assigned/attached and operational control (OPCON) transfers to the operational chain of command established by that commander. In addition, AFRC forces are also assigned to deployable Air Expeditionary Forces (AEFs) and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty Regular Air Force and part-time Air National Guard counterparts in their assigned deployment cycle window. The Air Force Reserve also contains other specialized capabilities not found in regular active duty Air Force units. For example, the Air Force Reserve conducts two unique mission sets for which it possesses the sole USAF capability: * Aerial Spray Missions ** At the request of local, state or federal agencies, the Air Force Reserve can conduct aerial spray missions employing insecticides or herbicides with specially-equipped C-130 aircraft. * Hurricane and Weather Reconnaissance ** The Air Force Reserve maintains the Air Force's sole aerial weather reconnaissance capability, to include hurricane and typhoon penetration by its own WC-130J aircraft, augmenting the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3D aircraft fleet. A third unique mission set in the Air Force Reserve, Aerial Firefighting, is conducted in tandem with the Air National Guard and also has no counterpart in the Regular Air Force. Certain units of the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard can conduct forest fire and wildfire suppression missions using specially equipped C-130 Hercules aircraft using the palletized Modular Airborne FireFighting System (MAFFS). Along with its Regular Air Force and Air National Guard partners, the Air Force Reserve also participates in national and international humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) missions as directed by higher authority. Like their Air National Guard counterparts, the Air Force Reserve also supports counter- narcotics (CN) operations by performing detection and interdiction efforts outside the United States in coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies.  Reserve categories  There are several categories of service for personnel in the Air Force Reserve. Most Air Force Reservists are part-time Traditional Reservists (TR) who serve in the Unit Program, in which they are required to report for duty with their parent Air Force Reserve Command unit, typically a wing, group or squadron, at least one weekend a month and an additional two weeks a year (e.g., 38 days). However, many Air Force Reservists, especially those in an active flying status, serve well in excess of this minimum duty requirement, often in excess of 120-man-days a year.Cantwell, Gerald (1987), Citizen Airmen, A History of the Air Force Reserve, 1946‚Äì1994. Washington, D.C.: Air Force History and Museums Program: GPO, 1997 A smaller but equally important category of TR is the Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). IMAs are part-time Air Force Reservists who are assigned to active duty Air Force units and organizations, combat support agencies, Unified Combatant Commands and the Joint Staff to do jobs that are essential in wartime or during contingency operations, but do not require full-time manning during times of peace. They report for duty a minimum of two days a month and twelve additional days a year, but like their Unit Program counterparts, many IMAs serve well in excess of the minimum military duty requirement, providing multiple weeks or months of active duty \\"man-days\\" in support of active duty USAF and joint commands. A smaller number of Reservists serve limited tours of extended active duty in an Active Duty Special Work (ADSW) status, usually at an Air Force headquarters staff level, in the joint combatant commands, or in other special assignments. Their job is to bring Air Force Reserve expertise to the planning and decision-making processes at senior levels within the Air Force, other services, and the Unified Combatant Commands. Like the Air National Guard, the Air Force Reserve Command also requires two categories of full-time personnel to perform functions that require full-time manning. These full-time positions are filled via the same two programs as employed by the Air National Guard: the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) program and the Air Reserve Technician (ART) program. Air Force Reservists who become members of the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) receive full active duty pay and benefits just like active duty members of any branch of the armed forces. The majority of AGRs are former TRs and they serve four- year controlled tours of special duty that can be renewed. Many AGRs serve with operational AFRC flying and non-flying wings and groups; at active and reserve numbered air forces; on the staffs of other USAF Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Field Operating Agencies (FOAs) and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs); on the Air Staff at Headquarters, U.S. Air Force (HAF); on the staffs of Unified Combatant Commands; on the Joint Staff and in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). AFRC Recruiting is another field that employs AGR personnel. AGRs also have the option with good performance to serve 20 or more years on active duty and receive a retirement after 20 or more years, just like active members of the Regular Air Force. Another category of Air Force Reservists serving full-time are those in the Air Reserve Technician Program (ART). ARTs are accessed from either the active duty Regular Air Force, the AGR program, Traditional Guardsmen (TG) in the Air National Guard, or TRs in the Air Force Reserve. ARTs carry a dual status, working for the Air Force as both full-time civil service employees and as uniformed military members in the same AFRC units where they work as Department of the Air Force Civilians (DAFC), performing the same job duties. Although \\"technically\\" civil servants part of the time, all ART officers must maintain a reserve commission on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) as a TR and all ART enlisted personnel must maintain a current reserve enlistment as a TR as a precondition for both hiring and continued career employment as an ART. In addition, all ART officers and ART enlisted personnel wear their uniforms and utilize their rank titles at all times when on duty, regardless if they are in a DAFC status or in a drilling or active duty military status. Most ART personnel are assigned to operational AFRC flying wings, groups and squadrons in various operational flying, aircraft maintenance and other support positions and functions, up to and including wing commander. Because ARTs are not eligible for DAFC retirement until reaching age 60, and because a condition of their employment as an ART is contingent upon their maintaining an active reserve military status until reaching age 60, ARTs are not subject to the same maximum years of service limitations by pay grade that impact non-ART personnel. As such, ART personnel are permitted to remain in uniform until age 60, typically past a point that would otherwise require their retirement from military service based on rank, pay grade and years of service. Traditional Reservists (TR) are categorized by several criteria in either the Ready Reserve, Standby Reserve, Inactive Ready Reserve or Retired Reserve: * Ready Reserve : Approximately 74,000 trained personnel who may be recalled to Active Duty to augment active forces in time of war, contingency operations, or other national emergency. This category also includes all full-time ART personnel. They are predominantly assigned to the Unit Program or as IMAs. * Standby Reserve : Includes Reservists whose civilian jobs are considered key to national defense or who have temporary disability or personal hardship. Most do not train, are not assigned to units and are typically not eligible for promotion/advancement. * Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) : Comprises members who no longer train with combat ready Reserve units, but are qualified in their fields and eligible to be recalled in the event of a national emergency. : There is a small group labeled as Participating IRR (PIRR) who receive points toward military retirement, but not drill pay or Annual Training with pay and are under what the Air Force Reserve (and Air National Guard) designates as Category E (CAT E) status. Some PIRR members continue to participate with existing Air Force organizations in a non-pay status or in Unified Combatant Commands where they may be eligible to perform Active Duty for Training (ADT), Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS), Active Duty Special Work (ADSW) ... also known as \\"mandays\\" ... or voluntary Mobilization to Active Duty (MOB) with full pay and allowances. CAT E Air Force Reservists also include some 1,000 USAF Academy Liaison Officers (ALOs), Civil Air Patrol Reserve Liaison Officers (RLOs), chaplains, and a few other positions that require military duty, but not a fixed schedule. These CAT E personnel can also earn active duty mandays with pay just like CAT A and B reservists, but on a more limited basis. * Retired Reserve : The Retired Reserve is made up of retired personnel who receive pay after retiring from Active Duty or a Reserve Component, or are Reservists awaiting retirement pay at age 60. Some exceptions are made for certain Reservists mobilized to Active Duty since 11 September 2001 who may receive retirement pay earlier on a sliding scale between ages 58 and 60. Eligibility for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Standard medical coverage for retirees and their families is delayed until the retiree reaches age 60.  Associate Program  A USAF Associate Unit is a unit where active duty, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard members combine forces and missions using \\"Total Force\\" concept integration. The Air Force Reserve Command Associate Program provides trained crews and maintenance personnel for active-duty owned aircraft. This unique program pairs a Reserve unit with an active-duty unit to share a single set of aircraft and rests on the idea that there are more operational requirements than there are manpower to fulfill them. The Associate Reserve program is based on providing manpower to complement the Total Force. Previously, an associate unit was one where the active duty (typically a wing level organization) owned the aircraft and the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard wing or group co-located with the active duty unit, providing only manpower. To take advantage of the synergies and aircraft, active duty units are now being stood up at what were previously Air Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard locations, where the Air Reserve Component organization technically \\"owns\\" the aircraft, but share them with an active duty squadron, group or wing that provides additional manning. This enables the Air Force to be more productive in meeting the global demands for primarily the Mobility Air Forces (MAF), the Air Force's cargo and aerial refueling aircraft, although the concept is now being extended to the Combat Air Forces (CAF), the Air Force's fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, rescue and special operations aircraft, as well. The result is a more cost-effective way to meet increasing mission requirements. * In an active associate unit, the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard owns the aircraft, while the active duty Regular Air Force embeds a squadron, group or wing that provides air crews, aircraft maintenance and support personnel who share the responsibility of flying and maintaining the AFRC or ANG aircraft. * In a traditional associate unit, Air Force Reservists fly and maintain aircraft owned by the active duty Regular Air Force. In many of these units, particularly in the MAF, the aircraft have been re-marked to include both Regular Air Force and Air Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard organizational and unit markings. * A corollary unit is an Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard squadron or group attached to an active duty squadron or group. Associate unit reservists are most heavily concentrated in the Air Mobility Command (AMC) and fly AMC's largest airlifters, the C-5 Galaxy, and the newest AMC global airlifter, the C-17 Globemaster III, with Air Force Reserve associate crews accounting for nearly 50 percent of the Air Force's total C-5 and C-17 air crew capability. AFRC also provides sole Formal Training Unit (FTU) functions in the C-5 for the Regular Air Force, the Air Force Reserve, and prior to the C-5's retirement from that component, the Air National Guard. AFRC also provides aerial refueling capability with aircrews operating AMC KC-10 Extenders in associate units and KC-135 Stratotankers in both associate and Air Reserve Component air mobility wings, air refueling wings and air refueling groups. Associate KC-10 units provide 50 percent of the KC-10 crews and contribute 50 percent to the maintenance force. Air Force Reservists also contribute about 13 percent of total KC-135 aerial refueling requirements. In another alignment with AMC, more than 9,100 Air Force Reservists train in the C-130 Hercules theater airlift mission in a variety of aircrew, aircraft maintenance and support skills as both stand alone AFRC units and in \\"Associate\\" arrangements with Regular Air Force and Air National Guard C-130 units. In wartime, AFRC provides 23 percent of Air Force's total C-130 theater airlift force, with nearly half of the Air Force Reserve's airlift units flying their own unit-assigned C-130 Hercules aircraft, several of which have now integrated Active Associate units from the Regular Air Force. The C-130's speed, range, load-carrying characteristics and capability to operate under difficult terrain conditions make it an invaluable and versatile aircraft, strong enough to deliver its cargo on unimproved landing strips. Other AMC- aligned AFRC missions involve aeromedical evacuation and special air support operations. Air Combat Command (ACC) F-22A Raptor air dominance fighters, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle multipurpose fighters, A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, MQ-1 Predator remotely-piloted aircraft are jointly operated by ACC active duty personnel and AFRC aircrews via Associate units. Several AFRC Air Operations Centers (AOCs) also operate as stand alone units or in associate augmentation to ACC, AMC, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and U.S. Air Forces Central (AFCENT) AOCs operating the AN/USQ-163 Falconer AOC weapons system. In associate programs with the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), AFRC support undergraduate pilot training by providing instructor pilots in the T-6 Texan II, T-38 Talon and T-1 Jayhawk. AFRC Space Operations associate units aligned with the United States Space Force also operate Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), Defense Support Program (DSP) and Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites as well as various cyber warfare systems.  Unit Program with AFRC-owned Aircraft  AFRC also operates numerous F-16 and A-10 aircraft in stand-alone AFRC fighter wings that are operationally aligned with the Air Combat Command (ACC). AFRC's HC-130 and HH-60 combat search and rescue (CSAR) aircraft are also assigned to stand-alone flying units that are operationally aligned with ACC. A single AFRC bomb wing is equipped with the B-52 and is operationally aligned with Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). AFRC also operates stand-alone C-5, C-17, C-130, C-40 and KC-135 units that are operated by the Air Mobility Command (AMC). The Air Force Reserve also operates the WC-130 Hurricane Hunter in the weather reconnaissance mission and provides the sole USAF capability for this mission set. In tandem with Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), AFRC previously operated the MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft until its retirement in 2013. AFRC's sole special operations wing currently operates the C-146A Wolfhound, C-145A Skytruck, and U-28U-28A, providing Formal Training Unit (FTU) functions for both the active duty Air Force and the Air Force Reserve on those aircraft. The 919 SOW also operates the MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) in the attack and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) roles.  Units  Nearly 70,000 reservists are assigned to specific Air Force Reserve units. These are the people who are obligated to report for duty for a minimum one weekend each month and two weeks of annual training a year, with most performing many additional days of military duty. Reserve aircrews, for example, average more than 120 military duty days a year, often flying in support of national objectives at home and around the world. Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs), the special group of reservists who work as Air Force civil service employees during the week in the same jobs they hold as reservists on drill weekends and active duty periods, provide a degree of continuity that serves to make the Air Force Reserve a relevant combat force. ARTs are the full-time backbone of the unit training program, providing day-to-day leadership, administrative and logistical support, and operational continuity for their units. More than 9,500 reservists, over 15 percent of the force, serve full-time as ARTs. Air Force Reserve Command consists of three Numbered Air Forces: Fourth Air Force (4 AF) March Air Reserve Base, California * 315th Airlift Wing (C-17A) : Associate unit with 437th Airlift Wing :

The Air Force Reserve (AFRES) was created as a separate operating agency (SOA) and replaced a major command ‚Äì Continental Air Command ‚Äì which inactivated in August 1968. Upon activation, AFRES assumed command of all personnel, equipment and aircraft previously assigned to ConAC. As the 1970s unfolded, the challenge then was to find the right mix of forces for mission effectiveness. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird adopted the Total Force concept in August 1970 with Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger declaring it policy in 1973. With the implementation of the Total Force Policy, the Air Force Reserve became a multi-mission force, flying the same modern aircraft as the active Air Force. Mobilization planning and operational evaluation were integrated with the corresponding active duty functions. With the same equipment and budget authority, the Air Force Reserve was held to the same readiness standards and inspections as regular Air Force units. Special operations, air refueling, weather reconnaissance, and, once again, fighter missions were added to the airlift, rescue, and mission support roles performed by the Air Force Reserve. The associate concept soon expanded to include the C-5 Galaxy. = Cold War era = Air Force Reserve participation in Air Force exercises and deployments perfected its mobility capabilities as demonstrated throughout the seventies. This was most notable during Operation Nickel Grass, the Israeli assistance airlift of 1973, with some 630 crew members volunteering for Middle East missions including flying into Ben Gurion Airport, Tel Aviv. Another 1,590 Reservists performed missions worldwide, freeing up additional active crews to support the airlift. The 1980s saw the modernization and expansion of the Air Force Reserve program. KC-10 Extenders joined the associate force in 1981, expanding its air refueling capability. Fighter units obtained the more modern A-10 Thunderbolt II ground support aircraft and F-4 Phantom IIs, and in 1984, the Air Force Reserve received its first F-16A Fighting Falcon. Operationally, the Air Force Reserve participated in Operation Urgent Fury, the return of American students from Grenada in 1983, performed air refuelings of F-111 bombers during the El Dorado Canyon raid on Libyan-sponsored terrorists in 1986, and acted as a full partner in Operation Just Cause which ousted Panama's General Manuel Noriega in 1989‚Äì1990. Air Force Reservists also supported humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, including resupply and evacuation missions in the aftermath of 1989's Hurricane Hugo. The Reserve's continual volunteering allayed the concerns of those who believed the Air Force Reserve would not be available when really needed. = Middle East and Yugoslav operations = Air Force Reserve airlift and tanker crews were flying within days of Saddam Hussein's Invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. When ground operations commenced as part of Operation Desert Storm, Air Force Reserve A-10s from the NAS New Orleans-based 926th Tactical Fighter Group (926 TFG) operated close to the front lines along with Air Force Reserve special operations and rescue forces. A Reservist scored the first-ever A-10 air-to- air kill. When Operations Desert Shield/Storm ended, the air Force Reserve counted 23,500 Reservists mobilized with another 15,000 serving in a volunteer capacity. The Air Force Reserve had become indistinguishable from the active force in capability; there was no difference between an Air Force Reserve pilot and an active duty pilot, or a boom operator, or loadmaster. In the aftermath of Desert Storm, Air Force Reservists continued to serve and were heavily involved in both Operation Northern Watch and Operation Southern Watch during the 1990s, enforcing the United Nations-mandated no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq as well as in humanitarian relief missions during Operation Provide Comfort to assist uprooted Iraqi Kurds. For over six years, Air Force Reserve C-130s performed these Provide Comfort missions on a rotational basis while F-16s and combat rescue HH-60 Pave Hawks deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, for the no-fly operations. In 1993, when tensions mounted in Bosnia, Air Force Reserve tanker and fighter units participated in enforcing the Operation Deny Flight no-fly zone while airlift units ensured logistical resupply. Following Operation DESERT STORM in 1991, the Air Force increasingly relied on its Air Reserve Component, both AFRC and ANG, for a \\"steady state\\" of daily assistance, whether it was flying airlift channel; providing fighter, tanker and theater airlift support of \\"no fly\\" zone enforcement operations in Southwest Asia; aerial fire fighting; aerial spray; hurricane hunter missions; military air/sea rescue support of NASA Space Shuttle operations; or providing highly skilled medical and aeromedical personnel. As a result, Congress sought to clarify the organizational placement of the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) in the larger active duty Air Force organizational structure. Accordingly, in February 1997, the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) officially became the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), the Air Force's ninth major command. Between March and September 1999, Air Force Reservists volunteered and were also mobilized for Operation Allied Force operations over Serbia and Kosovo. The involuntary recall marked the ninth time the Air Force had requested a mobilization of Air Force Reserve units and personnel since 1950. In summary, Reservists provided 150,000 mandays of support that spanned the spectrum of Air Force missions. The Air Force Reserve once again proved itself as an adaptable and capable force, ready to perform the full range of Air Force operations on an integrated and daily basis in sync with the new Air Expeditionary Task Force (AEF) concepts. = Global War on Terrorism = When terrorists attacked the United States on 11 September 2001, Air Force Reservists responded in full measure. Air Force Reserve F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters flew Combat air patrols (CAPs) protecting America's cities while AFRC KC-135 Stratotankers and E-3 Sentry AWACs aircraft supported with air refuelings and security. In October 2001, the United States initiated the Global War on Terrorism as military forces entered Afghanistan to combat the Taliban in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Air Force Reserve special operations MC-130 Combat Talon aircraft became the first fixed-wing aircraft to penetrate Afghan airspace while Air Force Reserve F-16 crews, already deployed in theater for Operation Southern Watch, performed the first combat missions. Air Force Reservists made significant contributions by flying close air support, combat delivery, rescue, strategic airlift, and air refueling missions supporting operations in Afghanistan. They also provided B-52 Stratofortress, special operations, aeromedical, security forces, and civil engineering support. Air Force Reserve A-10s, HH-60s and C-130 Hercules continue to perform rotational tours in Afghanistan, and Air Force Reservists have been instrumental in building the Afghan National Army Air Corps. When Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the war against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq began in March 2003, Air Force Reserve combat-ready A-10, B-52, and F-16 aircrews flew numerous strike operations during the first hours of engagement and performed special operations and rescue missions. Air Reserve rescue personnel were among the first into Tallil Air Base as Reserve A-10s provided close air support. Part of the lead tanker force, Reserve tankers offloaded more than 21 million pounds of fuel to more than 1,000 aircraft. In late March 2003, fifteen C-17 Globemaster III Reserve associate crews supported the C-17 airdrop, which opened up the Northern Front in Iraq. Additionally, Reservists supported Air Force Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) missions and space-based operations in Southwest Asia, providing essential data to battlefield commanders. During the combat phase (19 March-1 May) of OIF, Air Force Reserve aircraft and crews flew nearly 162,000 hours and deployed 70 unit-equipped aircraft in theater while aeromedical personnel provided 45 percent of the Air Force's aeromedical crews that performed 3,108 patient movements. The Air Force Reserve continues to expand its associate construct across the mission spectrum. Specific examples are the Air Force Reserve 477th Fighter Group associating at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, flying the F-22 Raptor jointly with the PACAF 3d Wing and the active duty associating with the C-40 Clipper-equipped 932d Airlift Wing with the 375th Air Mobility Wing at Scott AFB, Illinois, and the 433d Airlift Wing C-5 Galaxy at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. On the horizon, associate units will include future weapon systems such as the F-35 Lightning II and the Next-Generation Bomber in the 2020s. = Lineage = * The War Department established an Army Air Forces Air Reserve Program as part of the United States Army Air Forces, July 1946.

Transmitter Berlin-Britz was a broadcasting facility for medium wave, shortwave and FM on the site of a former tree nursery in Berlin-Britz. It was established in 1946 and until 1993 it was the most important transmitter of RIAS. It was used by Deutschlandradio until 4 September 2013. The Berlin-Britz transmitter initially used a wire supported between two tall wooden poles. This aerial was replaced in 1947 by a guyed insulated steel framework mast. This mast was replaced in turn in 1948 by two guyed insulated steel framework masts, each with a height of and which still exist today. These masts were extended in subsequent years so that today they are and tall and carry FM radio broadcasting antennas. Since 1949 the Berlin- Britz transmitter has also been a shortwave transmission facility. A dipole aerial aligned in east-west direction was installed. A second shortwave broadcasting aerial in the form of a dipole with whole length was built in 1983. A cross dipole aerial for the medium wave frequency 990 kHz was built in 1978 to provide better coverage to the former East Germany for RIAS‚Äô first channel. This aerial for circular polarization radiated vertically in the ionosphere and permitted good reception of RIAS 1 in the entire former East Germany.

Musical works as composer and performer  In 2004, Ibarra recorded Folkloriko, a cycle of 11 pieces dedicated to a day in the life of a Filipino migrant worker. The work was premiered at the Freer Gallery of Art of the Smithsonian Institution in conjunction with the first Filipino photography exhibit by Ricardo Alvarado. Recorded on Tzadik Records and performed by Jennifer Choi (violin), Craig Taborn (piano), Wadada Leo Smith (trumpet) and Ibarra (drums and percussion). In 2006 Ibarra released, Dialects by Electric Kulintang on Plastic Records, a duo collaboration with Roberto Juan Rodriguez with compositions featuring electronics, kulintang gongs, percussion, drums and field recordings. In 2007, American Composers Orchestra commissioned Pintados Dream/The Painted‚Äôs Dream, a drum concerto with Ibarra soloing, a chamber orchestra and visual art by Makoto Fujimura which world premiered at Carnegie Zankel Hall in October of that year. In February 2007 she composed for a commission by Ars Nova Workshop in Philadelphia, Kit: Music for Four Pianists, eight-hand piano, in an evening work of Ibarra‚Äôs percussion music. Also in 2007, her solo CD, Drum Sketches, was commissioned by The Brecht Forum and American Composers Forum on Innova Recordings. These solo pieces are performed and recorded by Ibarra on drum kit, sarunay and kulintang (Philippine xylophone and eight rowed gongs), also including field recordings. They are sonic sketches of Ibarra‚Äôs sound that include both traditional and avant-garde musical idioms. In August 2008, MoMa Summergarden and Jazz at Lincoln Center commissioned Ibarra for a premiere of Summer Fantasy and Folklore at the MoMa Summergarden. Ibarra premiered the suite inspired by summers in Houston, New York and Manila with the debut of her quartet featuring Jennifer Choi (violin), Kathleen Supove (piano), Bridget Kibbey (harp) and Susie Ibarra (drumset and percussion). Also in 2008, Ibarra composed and recorded the music for video installation art, Madre Selva: Homage to Ana Mendieta, created by Visual Artist and Guggenheim Fellow, Juan Sanchez for his exhibition at Lehigh University's Zoellner Arts Center, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The art work is a tribute to the late Cuban American sculptor, installation and performance artist, Ana Mendieta. In 2010 Music Theatre Group produced two residencies of Saturnalia, a new music theatre work, composed by Ibarra, written by Yusef Komunyakaa, directed by Daniel Fish and music directed by John diPinto. The new music work features 10 actor/singers, the Young Peoples Chorus of NYC, and a chamber ensemble. Saturnalia is a bicultural musical theatre work sung in English and Thai. The story is set in Thailand and portrays the illusion of Paradise that masks a psychological warfare in the minds of US soldiers, and business men and women enslaved in sex trafficking.

Bahuchara was born in the Charan (Gadhvi) society. Devi Bahuchara was the daughter of Bapaldaan Detha. is considered patroness of the hijra community. Her primary temple is located in Becharaji town in Mehsana district of Gujarat, India.  Depiction and symbols  Bahuchara was born in the Charan (Gadhvi) society. Devi Bahuchara was the daughter of Bapaldaan Detha. Bahuchara Mata is shown as a woman who carries a sword on her bottom left, a text of scriptures on her top left, the abhay hasta mudra (\\"showering of blessings\\") on her bottom right, and a trident on her top right. She is seated on a rooster, which symbolises innocence. One of the theory says that she is one of the goddesses in Sri Chakra. The real symbol of her vehicle is kurkut which means the serpent which has two mouths. Bahucharaji is seated on the low end and the other end goes to Sahasrara, which means that Bahucharaji is the goddess starting the awakening of kundalini which eventually leads the liberation or moksha.  Emergence of Bala Bahuchara Maa  According to ancient tradition, a (asura) named Dandhasur who was the predecessor of Dhumrlochan, another asura who was defeated and killed by goddess Jagadambe, Dandhasur wanted to take the revenge of the death of his ancestor, so he performed austerities in praise of the god (Shiva). Lord Shiva was praised by Dhandasur's practice and granted the boon of Vardan, so he asked that the goddess who killed his ancestor, Dhumralochan, should come in front of him. Lord Shiva promised him that goddess who killed Dhumralochan will come in front of him in form of a small girl. After getting the Vardan, Dandhasur won all the battles on earth as well as Pataal and Mrutyulok. Then he went for battle on heaven (devaloka); hence all the devas went to lord Indra and goddess Parambaa for protection against Dandhasur. After listening to their prayers, the goddess Parambaa promised them that in accordance with the Vardan of Lord Shiva, she would take the form of a small girl and defeat the devil Dandhasur. She promised them that she would transform into a small girl, that her place of emergence will be the place where a part of the goddess Sati's hand was dropped on the earth, and she would be named Bala Bahuchara. Parambaa fulfilled her promise and emerged as Bala Bahuchara. Dandhasur saw this small girl sitting under a tree called Varakhdi. Dandhasur came closer to the girl and asked who she was. The girl replied that she came here from the devaloka, as all the devas from the devaloka had lost the battle and moved to other place so she was left alone; hence she was sitting under the tree. Dandhasur was impressed by the courage of the small girl and asked her to go with him as he would treat her like his daughter, to which she agreed. Upon reaching a place called Chuvad, Dandhasur felt thirsty, but there was no water all around. Bala Devi hit her trishul on the ground near a tree of Varakhdi, and fountains of water came out of the ground. Dandhasur, after drinking water, was pleased and asked Bala Bahucharato marry him when she grew up. This made godesss Bala Bahuchara angry and she transformed in her ugra swaroop, telling his that she is the one whom he wanted to see and she was the only one who killed his ancestor Dhmralochan. Now the time had come for him to be punished for his evil and dreadful deeds. She killed him with her trishul. She also killed many other devils who were causing trouble for many innocent people and devas and fulfilled her promise, thus making them fearless. She came to Shankalpur, where she again transformed herself from ugra swaroop to a small girl. Bala Bahuchara is worshiped as goddess Bahuchara Maa. Temple Bahuchara Mata Temple complex in Mehsana district Bahucharaji Temple is located in Bahucharaji town in Mehsana district of Gujarat, India. It is 82 km from Ahmedabad and 35 km west of Mahesana. The original shrine was built by a king called Sankhal Raj in 1152 and the first surviving mention of the shrine was found in an inscription dating 1280 . According to the inscription no changes were made in the temple architecture until the eighteenth century. There are three shrines of the Goddess within the temple complex. The oldest part of the shrine complex termed 'Adyasthan' (the original site) is a small temple enclosing a sprawling, small-leafed varakhadi tree, believed to be the site where the goddess first appeared. Adjoining this is another small temple, the madhya sthan (second or intermediate place), which houses an incised plaque representing the goddess and has a locked silver door at its entrance. This part of the temple is believed to have been built by a Maratha named Fadnavis (or an official with that title) in the eighteenth century. In 1779 , Manajirao Gaekwad, the younger brother of the Maratha ruler of Baroda, built a third structure close to the original shrine after the goddess cured him of a tumour. The third is the main temple today and contains the Bala Yantra of quartz crystal representing the Goddess. Saint Kapildev and Kalari king Tejpal have also contributed to the construction and renovation of the temple. The temple complex is beautifully decorated with stone carvings and wall paintings. Though less well known outside of Gujarat and Rajasthan, the temple is considered a minor Shakti Peetha and every year about 1.5 million pilgrims visit this temple.

The society was founded in 1988 under the leadership of 12 priests who were formerly members of the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), another traditionalist organization, but were unwilling to remain part of it following the √âc√¥ne consecrations, which resulted in its bishops being excommunicated by the Holy See. Headquartered in Switzerland, the society maintains two international seminaries: the International Seminary of St. Peter in Wigratzbad-Opfenbach, Bavaria, and Our Lady of Guadalupe Seminary in Denton, Nebraska, United States. The society is officially recognized by the Holy See and its priests celebrate the Tridentine Mass in locations in 124 worldwide dioceses. Canonical status According to canon law, the FSSP is a \\"Clerical Society of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right\\". It is not, therefore, an Institute of Consecrated Life and members take no religious vows, but are instead bound by the same general laws of celibacy and obedience as diocesan clergy and, in addition, swear an oath as members of the society. The fraternity's pontifical-right status means that it has been established by the Pope and is answerable only to him in terms of its operation (through the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith; prior to January 17, 2019, through the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei), rather than to local bishops. A local bishop still governs the fraternity's work within his respective diocese. In this sense its organization and administrative reporting status are similar to those of religious orders of pontifical right (for example, the Jesuits or Dominicans). Mission and charism Members of the fraternity celebrating Solemn Mass The FSSP consists of priests and seminarians who intend to pursue the goal of Christian perfection according to a specific charism, which is to offer the Mass and other sacraments according to the Roman Rite as it existed before the liturgical reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council. Thus, the fraternity uses the Roman Missal, the Roman Breviary, the Pontifical (Pontificale Romanum), and the Roman Ritual in use in 1962, the last editions before the revisions that followed the Council. The 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum has authorized use of the 1962 Roman Missal by all Latin Rite priests as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite without limit when celebrating Mass \\"without a congregation\\". Its use for Mass with a congregation is allowed with the permission of the priest in charge of a church for stable groups attached to this earlier form of the Roman Rite, provided that the priest using it is \\"qualified to do so and not juridically impeded\\" (as for instance by suspension).Summorum Pontificum, art. 5 Following from its charism, the fraternity's mission is twofold: to sanctify each priest through the exercise of his priestly function, and to deploy these priests to parishes. As such, they are to celebrate the sacraments, catechise, preach retreats, organize pilgrimages, and generally provide a full sacramental and cultural life for lay Catholics who are likewise drawn to the rituals of the 1962 missal. In order to help complete its mission, the fraternity has built its own seminaries with the goal of forming men to serve the fraternity. Founding The FSSP was established on July 18, 1988, at the Abbey of Hauterive, Switzerland, by twelve priests and twenty seminarians, led by Josef Bisig, all of whom had formerly belonged to Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre's Society of Saint Pius X; they were unwilling to follow that movement into what the Congregation for Bishops and Pope John Paul II declared to be a schismatic act and grounds for excommunication latae sententiae due to the consecration of four bishops without a papal mandate. Josef Bisig became the fraternity's first superior general. Organization Palm Sunday procession at an FSSP apostolate in Perpignan, France , the fraternity included 482 members: 320 priests, 17 deacons, and 145 non-deacon seminarians in 142 dioceses spread among Australia, Austria, Benin, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, Poland, Switzerland, and the United States. The fraternity's membership represents 35 nationalities, and the average age of its members is 38. , the lay Confraternity of Saint Peter had 6,996 members enrolled, who spiritually support the fraternity's charism. =Superiors General= The FSSP's current superior general is Andrzej Komorowski. * Josef Bisig (1988‚Äì2000) * Arnaud Devillers (2000‚Äì2006) * John Berg (2006‚Äì2018) * Andrzej Komorowski (2018‚Äìpresent) =Districts and regions= The fraternity is divided into three districts and one region: * German-speaking District, Superior: Bernhard Gerstle * French District, Superior: Beno√Æt Paul-Joseph * North American District, Superior: Michael Stinson * Southern Cross Region, Superior: Michael McCaffrey =Educational institutions= The fraternity has two seminaries: * The International Seminary of St. Peter in Wigratzbad-Opfenbach, in the German state of Bavaria (Diocese of Augsburg), was established in 1988.

Its current rector is Pater Josef Bisig. Ezekiel House, a house of formation for first-year seminarians, exists in the city of Sydney, Australia. The Director of Ezechiel House is Duncan Wong. In 2015, the fraternity established in Guadalajara, Mexico, Casa Cristo Rey, an apostolate which it plans to develop into a house of formation for first-year seminarians for native Spanish-speaking postulants. Presently, Casa Cristo Rey serves as a priestly discernment program for young men from Spain and Latin America. In 2016 Casa Cristo Rey opened the Junipero Serra Spanish Institute, a program offering 6 or 8 weeks of Spanish immersion for priests and seminarians. Until 2012, the fraternity also operated an American boarding school: St. Gregory's Academy in Elmhurst, Pennsylvania.

It was originally published in 1965, two years after her death by suicide. The poems in the 1965 edition of Ariel, with their free flowing images and characteristically menacing psychic landscapes, marked a dramatic turn from Plath's earlier Colossus poems. In the 1965 edition of Ariel, Ted Hughes changed Plath's chosen selection and arrangement by dropping twelve poems, adding twelve composed a few months later and shifting the poems' ordering, in addition to including an introduction by the poet Robert Lowell. Having Lowell write the introduction to the book was appropriate, since, in a BBC interview, Plath cited Lowell's book Life Studies as having had a profound influence over the poetry she was writing in this last phase of her writing career. In the same interview, Plath also cited the poet Anne Sexton as an important influence on her writing during this time since Sexton was also exploring some of the same dark, taboo, personal subject matter that Plath was exploring in her writing. In 2004, a new edition of Ariel was published which for the first time restored the selection and arrangement of the poems as Plath had left them; the 2004 edition also features a foreword by Plath and Hughes' daughter Frieda Hughes.

It was founded in 1972 and continues to serve clients in Seattle, King County and beyond. It is considered a significant part of civil rights history in the Pacific Northwest. History Roberto Maestas, 2008 In the early 1960s thousands of Latinos in Seattle, nearly all of whom were seeking employment, found themselves lacking a traditional community center: a barrio, with a Latin American-style plaza. In early 1972, the ESL Program at South Seattle Community College suddenly found themselves without a physical home. Inspired by the 1970 occupation by Native Americans of the decommissioned Fort Lawton in Seattle's Magnolia neighborhood, which resulted in the founding of the Daybreak Star Cultural Center, members of the ESL program occupied an empty school building originally built in 1904 in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood that had been closed due to declining student enrollment.http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Neighborhoods/HistoricPreservation/HistoricResourcesSurvey/context- beacon-hill.pdf On October 11, 1972 the group established itself as El Centro de la Raza. Leaders of the building takeover quickly won a pledge from Seattle Public Schools superintendent Forbes Bottomly that no effort would be made to evict them by force. The school district even arranged to open a back door for fire safety. The school had a sprinkler system, but its water long had been cut off.Johansen, Bruce. \\"Beacon Hill Confrontation: Chicanos were Following Slogan ‚ÄôPower to the People‚Äô\\", Seattle Times, October 22, 1972, N.p. After three months of occupying the building and numerous rallies, petitions and letters, the Seattle City Council agreed to hear their case. At one point, pressing for an audience, supporters of the occupation had laid siege to the City Council's chambers. The people who occupied the building joked that they were simply implementing advice from Washington governor Dan Evans, \\"advocating use of empty schools for community needs, such as child care\\". The City Council finally approved the lease, but mayor Wes Uhlman vetoed the action. Supporters then occupied the mayor's office and were arrested. An accord was finally reached with a five-year lease signed January 20, 1973 at $1 rent annually.Johansen, Bruce E. and Roberto Maestas. El Pueblo: The Gallegos Family's American Journey.

In 2007, El Centro celebrated its 35th anniversary with a gathering of nearly 1,000 people at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle.  Social activism  During the early 1980s, when the Reagan Administration was supporting the Nicaraguan Contras, El Centro played a major role in convincing the Seattle City Council to adopt Managua as a sister city, despite strong initial opposition from Seattle City Council. El Centro's bond with Nicaragua was forged before the Sandinistas took power in 1979. The relationship between El Centro and Managua began following the 1972 Nicaragua Earthquake and El Centro was able to coordinate relief efforts in the Seattle area. The organization continued to practice direct action. When the Washington Natural Gas Company cut off El Centro's heat the teachers and children of the child-development center sat in the office of the CEO of Washington Natural Gas until the gas was restored.Johansen and Maestas, op. cit., p. 133.

This sketch was featured in Episode 19 of the Monty Python's Flying Circus TV series, first broadcast on 3 November 1970. A somewhat different version of the sketch (leading into The Lumberjack Song) was also featured on the Monty Python Live at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane album.Among other changes, the live version at Drury Lane gave a shorter name to the Very Silly candidate in Harpenden and changed some of the first syllables of Tarquin's surname, making it Fin-tim-lim-bim-(brief pause)lim- bim-bim-bim-bim. Sensible Candidate James Walker became Jeannette Walker, and Silly Candidate Jethro Q. Walrustitty was referred to as Jethro Q. Bunn Whackett Buzzard Stubble and Boot Walrustitty (\\"Bun, Whacket, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot\\" was an early name considered for what became \\"Monty Python.\\"). Elsie Zzzzzzzzzzzz was also referred to as Mrs rather than Mr. A longer edit of the Drury Lane version also appeared on the promotional flexidisc Monty Python's Tiny Black Round Thing. The sketch also provides the basis for an item in Monty Python's Big Red Book in the form of a mock pamphlet for the Silly Party, which alongside characters from the original sketch, also names both Paul Fox and Ian MacNaughton as Silly Party candidates. Throughout the sketch, the linkman (John Cleese) and other commentators appear in a fixed sequence, either giving variations on their original statement or simply repeating it, as results are coming in from various constituencies. The election is mainly contested by two major parties, the Sensible Party and the Silly Party, though third-party candidates (a candidate for the Slightly Silly Party and a Very Silly Independent candidate) make their appearance.

He founded the British pirate stations Wonderful Radio London, Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio during the 1960s. He also attempted to create free ports on the islands of Tortuga, Haiti and Dominica during the 1970s. Brief biography =Early life= After graduating from Abilene High School in 1943, Pierson attended the University of Texas at Austin. He served as a gunnery instructor in the US Army Air Forces prior to the end of World War II. After the War, he continued his education at Baptist-affiliated Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene while he also worked as an automobile salesman. =Business interests= In 1948, he married the former Francis Annette Grubbs and, at the age of 21, acquired his first car dealership, a Dodge-Plymouth agency in Comanche. After opening his second dealership in 1953 for Oldsmobile-Cadillac in Eastland, he went on to establish a number of other automobile dealerships in Texas selling such makes as Volkswagen, Hillman, Renault, Triumph, Jaguar, Porsche, and BMW. Don Pierson's other business ventures included a department store, a bowling facility, cable television, restaurants, oil investments, home banking, a slot car raceway, and farming and ranching operations. In 1963, he established U.S. Telephonics, the world's first computer telemarketing company and together, with a number of Abilene business leaders, he founded the Abilene National Bank (now Bank One - Abilene) in 1964 and served as the chairman of the board of the bank. =Mayor of Eastland= Although he was a soft-spoken individual, Pierson was also an untiring booster of his adopted hometown of Eastland. In 1957, he reopened the long-closed grass-strip Eastland airport which he renamed \\"Eastland International Airport.\\" Later, in the 1970s, he became the first person to land a jet aircraft in Eastland. He attracted world headlines when, as mayor of Eastland in 1964, he convinced his fellow council members to pass a purported ordinance banning all smoking in Eastland, with a mandatory three-year jail penalty for violators. It was intended as a humorous response to the Surgeon General's Commission on Smoking, whose recently-issued report on the dangers of smoking had been accompanied by an official photo showing the commissioners' ashtrays overflowing with cigarette butts. The Eastland anti-smoking ordinance proved prophetic, although, at the time, it generated a deluge of hate mail from the outraged citizens of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Soon after, Eastland again found itself in the headlines when, as president of the local Rotary Club, and at the height of the Cold War, Pierson managed to convince the Deputy Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Vladimir Alkimov, to appear as the featured speaker at the club's weekly meeting. =Pirate radio= In 1964, his interests took him to the UK, after reading The Dallas Morning News. The newspaper carried a report of the start- up of Radio Caroline and Radio Atlanta from ships at that time anchored off the coastline of Southeast England. In a 1984 interview, Pierson said he was captivated by the fact that these two offshore stations were the first and only all-day commercial radio broadcasters serving the UK. Pierson compared this with the number of stations then serving the population of his native Northwest Texas and realized that a UK radio operation could generate a lot of money. He caught the next available \\"red eye\\" flight to London from Dallas Love Field. On arriving, he chartered a small plane and flew over the two existing radio ships in the North Sea. After taking some photographs, he returned to Texas determined to create a station bigger and better than either of them. The end result was Radio London, which started transmitting on 16 December 1964 from the MV Galaxy, a former World War II United States Navy US Minesweeper. Radio London stopped transmitting 14 August 1967, when the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act came into effect in the United Kingdom. This law made it a criminal offence for any person to supply music, commentary, advertising, fuel, food, water or any other assistance (except for life-saving purposes) to any ship, offshore structure or aircraft used for broadcasting without a licence. Between 3 May 1966 and 13 November 1966, Pierson ran radio stations Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio from the MV Olga Patricia (later renamed MV Laissez Faire), a World War II vessel built in the USA as a supply ship. The two stations shared a studio and transmitter. In the years that followed Don Pierson attempted to launch three more offshore radio station ventures. The first was off the coast of New York using the ship that had been the former home of Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio but under the call sign of Wonderful Radio London. He then engaged in plans to use a new ship as the home of Wonderful Radio London which would broadcast from off the coast of California. Don Pierson re-entered the world of broadcasting during 1981 when he founded radio station KVMX-FM close to his home in Eastland, Texas. One of the local programs added to the station was the Wonderful Radio London Top 40 Show which by 1983 had evolved into a new company called Wonderful Radio London International with the intention of restarting the offshore station of the 1960s from a new ship off anchored once again off the coast of England. Although this plan failed to develop, a small syndicated programming network was formed using that name over XERF, KXOL in Fort Worth, Texas and KVMX. =Haitian Freeport= In 1967, during the time that Don Pierson was attempting to lease the ship which had been the former homes of Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio, he received a response from the Ambassador for Haiti in Washington, DC. Don Pierson's original plan was to lease or sell the ship to the government of Haiti for it to establish two powerful 50 kW commercial radio stations aimed at American tourists visiting the old buccaneer stronghold of Tortuga island, which is located some 10 miles off the north coast of the main Haitian island of Hispaniola which is also shared by the Dominican Republic. This offer became a plan to develop the island itself as a freeport and he was asked to assist the government of Haiti to encourage business investment in that poverty-stricken land. After years of research and negotiation, Don Pierson's idea of a privately financed, privately managed free enterprise zone became a reality in 1971 when Haitian dictator Fran√ßois Duvalier (known as \\"Papa Doc\\") and the Haitian government entered into a 99-year contract with Don Pierson's company called Dupont Caribbean Inc. This contract provided for the establishment of Freeport Tortuga. Within 18 months Don Pierson succeeded in building the island's first airport, a loading dock for seagoing vessels, a rudimentary water and sewer system, an electricity generating facility, and six miles of paved road. Of equal importance. the project created jobs for some 400 previously unemployed Haitians and resulted in the establishment of a small school to teach various job skills. During this period he also became Honorary Consul of the Republic of Haiti to Texas from 1969 through 1974. Tragically, the free port project came to abrupt end in 1974 when, after it was announced that Gulf Oil Corporation was contemplating investing more than $300 million to build a resort on the island, the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier (known as \\"Baby Doc\\"), summarily expropriated the project, resulting in its collapse. A similar venture on the island of Dominica which was attempted in the wake of the failed project in Haiti, also met with disaster following governmental turmoil in Dominica. Pierson family In his personal and private life Don Pierson was a longtime member of the First Presbyterian Church of Eastland. He was preceded in death by his parents, Ryce and Hazel Pierson, and his brother Ryce Pierson Jr. and survived by his wife Annette; his sisters, his son Grey, daughter Marilyn, and two grandchildren.

Naples?), was a Portuguese Jewish philosopher, physician and poet. His work Dialogues of Love was one of the most important philosophical works of his time. Biography The Abravanel (or Abrabanel) family was extraordinarily prominent among Jewish families in the Middle Ages, active in public service in the court of Castile. Judah (or Leon, as he is known in Spanish) was the son of Isaac ben Judah Abravanel, (meaning Isaac ‚Äúson of Judah‚Äù Abravenel) who, according to Soria was ‚Äúthe last great commentator of the Bible of Medieval Jewry‚Äù (12). Don Isaac was a statesman, financier, and a defender of the Jewish faith, who was also born in Lisbon in 1437 and spent most of his life in Portugal, eventually becoming a financial advisor to King Afonso V. However, in 1481 King Afonso V died and Don Isaac was suspected of conspiring to enthrone the Duke of Braganza, whom he had befriended earlier, over the son of Afonso, Jo√£o II. Consequently, he had to flee without his family from Portugal to Seville, then Castile, finally settling in Toledo. Don Isaac eventually took refuge from his financial and political dealings in his other love‚Äîliterature‚Äîwhile living with his family, with whom he was later reunited in Toledo. Spain had recently seen the marriage of Isabel de Castilla and Fernando de Arag√≥n, the Catholic Monarchs. Under their rule began the centralization of power in Spain, then fragmented by individual governance of its many regions. The monarchs desired to conquer the kingdom of Granada, which at that time was Muslim. Don Isaac Abravanel saw this as an opportunity and became a financier at the court. His son, Judah, joined him in service to the Catholic Monarchs in 1484 as personal doctor to the royal family. The year 1492 brought a turbulent change to the Abravanel family and to all Jews in Spain, as Isabella and Ferdinand ordered the forced conversion or expulsion of all Jews in Spain. Don Isaac, in a desperate plea, threw himself at the feet of the Catholic Monarchs and begged them to revoke their decree, but to no avail. He made plans to move his family to Naples, Italy. To no avail he bribed King Ferdinand and even threatened Queen Isabella that the Jews were the eternal people and therefore could not be destroyed. A plot was hatched to kidnap Judah's son as an attempt to persuade the Abravanel family to convert to Christianity and, ultimately, to remain in the service of the Catholic Monarchs. In an attempt to circumvent the plot, Judah sent his son to Portugal with a nurse, but by order of the king, the son was seized and baptized. This occurrence was a devastating insult to Judah and to his family, and was a source of bitterness throughout Judah's life and the topic of his writings years later. The Abravanel family chose exile over conversion, although it was not an easy choice, considering that there were not many places in Europe that Jews were welcomed and that living in exile required money, and the Jews were not allowed to take much with them. Originally intent on traveling to the Ottoman Empire, Don Isaac and his family settled in Naples. There, he became a financial advisor to the King of Naples, Ferrante, and his son Alfonso. The Abravanel family enjoyed a position of prestige in the court of Naples until 1494 when Charles VIII, king of France, invaded Naples. The Neapolitan royal family then fled to Sicily, accompanied by Don Isaac. Judah, meanwhile, moved to Genoa, where he studied in an Italian humanist milieu and probably wrote the first two of his Dialoghi. There is evidence that he moved from Genoa to Barletta in 1501, where he became a servant of King Frederick of Naples, leaving in 1503 for Venice, where he rejoined his father Dom Isaac. Other sources say that he left Genoa for Naples in 1501 and remained there until 1506. While in Naples, Judah (apparently overlooking the injuries of the past) became the doctor of the Spanish viceroy, Don Gonsalvo of Cordoba, ‚ÄúThe Great Captain.‚Äù By 1506, the Neapolitan government was defeated, and Spain gained control of southern Italy. Judah left Naples for Venice, where he dedicated himself again to the study of philosophy until 1507. After this time, little is known about Judah's life. His most famous work, Dialoghi d'amore, appears to have been written around 1501-02. In 1535, when his friend Mariano Lenzi discovered the manuscript and had it published in Rome, records indicate he had already died. There are claims that Judah converted to Christianity at the end of his life; however, upon further investigation, these claims appear unfounded. One source states that allusions made to Saint John the Evangelist in the work indicate his Christian beliefs; however, the tendency of Jewish scholars to cite examples from both New Testament and the Classics was common during this time. However, the Venetian press that printed the second and third editions of his Dialoghi in 1541 and 1545 claimed on the first pages of the work that the author had converted to Christianity: ‚ÄúDialoghi di Amore composti per Leone Medico, di Natione Hebreo, et di poi fatto Christiano‚Äù (Dialogues of Love, composed by Doctor Leon, of Hebrew heritage, and who later became Christian). This statement does not appear in the first edition, nor in later editions. Therefore, this ‚Äúeditorial note‚Äù was most likely included to promote the work and to persuade those who harbored hostilities against Jews at that time to purchase the book. Further evidence that Judah remained true to his Jewish faith can be found in Dialoghi, where Judah directly addresses his heritage and religion, stating that the book was written ‚Äúaccording to Hebrew truth‚Äù and addresses ‚Äúall of us who believe in the holy law of Moses.‚Äù Influences Through his travels, Judah was well-acquainted with many Italian humanists and with the Neapolitan Court. Some say he may have met Giovanni Pico della Mirandola while in Florence and composed for him a discourse on the ‚ÄúHarmony of the Skies.‚Äù If so, he also probably associated with Elia de Medigo, teacher of Pico della Mirandola, Yohanan Alemanno (a Jewish writer influenced by the Medici court and mysticism and author of Song of songs), Giovanni Pontano, Mario Equicola and monk Egidio da Viterbo. Leon was surrounded by humanists interested in the topic of Love. The Chancellor of Florence, Marsilio Ficino commented on Plato‚Äôs Symposium (1474‚Äì75), while Girolamo Benivieni composed his Canzone d‚Äôamore (1486), which Pico della Mirandola analyzed soon after. Equicola‚Äôs Libro della natura d‚Äôamore (1495), Pietro Bembo‚Äôs Asolani and Francesco Cattani da Diacceto‚Äôs De amore were published while Judah was writing. Abravanel‚Äôs Dialoghi is regarded as the finest of these works. Men√©ndez Pelayo describes it as the most monumental work of Platonic philosophy since Plotinus's Enneads. n Similar to other humanist works, Dialoghi is strongly influenced by Plato and Aristotle. Men√©ndez Pelayo states that Abravanel employs Platonic ideals in his work, but filtered through his heritage. That is, his Neo-platonism derived from the Hispanic Jewish community, especially the works of Solomon ibn Gabirol and Maimonides. A disciple of these renowned Jewish scholars, Abravanel was also influenced by the Hellenic spirit of the Renaissance. Platonic notions of reaching towards a nearly impossible ideal of beauty, wisdom, and perfection encompass the whole of the work. Dialoghi d'amore Dialogi De Amore Dialoghi d'amore (1595) The Dialoghi was an exceedingly popular book that enjoyed at least five editions in twenty years. First published in Italian, it was translated into French by Tyard, as well as into Hebrew and into Latin by Sarasin. The Inca Garcilaso de la Vega made one of its three translations into Spanish. Abravanel‚Äôs Dialoghi is notably one of the first original philosophical compositions to be published in the vernacular (as opposed to Latin). However, there is some controversy about the language in which it was originally written. According to Roth, although Abravenel had ample time to embrace and employ Italian, ‚Äúthe Dialogue read a little stiffly, [therefore] there is good reason to doubt whether [it] represents the original text‚Äù (xii). Also, the Hebrew text that remains was probably a translation, and while Spanish scholars also want to claim he wrote it in the language of the country from which he was exiled, it is possible that he wrote it in Judeo- Spanish, the language of many Spanish Jews and a mixture of Hebrew and Castilian. In the British Library, there is a manuscript (Or. Gaster 10688) of a Spanish translation written with Hebrew characters. This was once thought to have been the author's original, or a copy of it; this is no longer accepted, and the text corresponds very closely to the 1568 Spanish translation.James Nelson Novoa, \\"Consideraciones acerca de una versi√≥n aljamiada de los Di√°logos de amor de Le√≥n Hebreo\\", Sefarad, volume 65, no. 1, 2005, pp. 103-126; http://sefarad.revistas.csic.es/index.php/sefarad/article/viewFile/493/591 This translation was likely produced in order reclaim Abravanel's Jewish identity and to encourage Spanish-speaking diaspora communities and as an appeal to the Spanish king to remember and reconsider the situation of the Sephardic exiles.Bacich, Damian. \\"Negotiating Renaissance Harmony: The First Spanish Translation of Leone Ebreo's Dialoghi d'amore\\". 'Comitatus: A Journal of Medieval & Renaissance Studies ; 2005, Vol. 36, p114 In his Dialoghi d'amore, Judah (Leon) Abravanel seeks to define love in philosophical terms. He structures his three dialogues as a conversation between two abstract and mostly undeveloped ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù: Philo, representing love or appetite, and Sophia, representing science or wisdom, in other words, Philo+Sophia (philosophy). The first dialogue, titled, ‚ÄúPhilo and Sophia on Love and Desire‚Äù is a contemplation on the distinctions between love and desire, or the types of love and the true nature of love. In Sophia's opinion, love and desire are exclusive; however, Philo argues that love and desire mix in things we find pleasurable, and that desire assumes knowledge of its object and, thus, its existence. Philo defines desire as that which seeks to become united with its object and love as that which, in union with its object, is enjoyed. When love and desire intersect, there are three different qualities of objects: useful, pleasant and good. Useful objects are not loved and desired together. Useful objects are those that are possessed. Meanwhile, love and desire of pleasant objects grows and perishes at the same time; pleasant objects exist because of privation. Good objects, on the other hand, exist when love and desire have no limit. Sophia then asks Philo to distinguish love of God from love of friends. He posits that God is the fountainhead, reason and end of good in the world. However, as humans, we lack the knowledge to love God completely. Happiness is the next topic of discussion, and the two determine that it exists not by gaining or enjoying a possession but rather in wisdom, when virtue is assumed. Wisdom is not omniscience, however, which is noted to be almost unreachable and can be found only in knowing God or communing with the Active Intellect. From there, Sophia asks Philo to clarify knowledge and love of God. Wisdom is born out of the love of God, he explains, and is the source of human happiness. Sophia then asks Philo to give a definition of the love that he feels for her, according to their discussion. He attempts to win her affection by stating that union increases love because of the physical aspect of human love, while injury does not. He adds that love is born of Reason (though it is not subject to it directly, or at least not to its ‚Äúordinary‚Äù form; rather, ‚Äúheroic Reason‚Äù motivates it to seek the beloved as its object). At this point, Philo tells her that the hour is drawing late and she must rest while ‚Äúmy mind keeps it usual anguished watch.‚Äù However, she is not satisfied to end the discussion yet. The second dialogue, titled, ‚ÄúPhilo and Sophia on the Universality of Love‚Äù postulates that love is the dominant principle of all life and describes how love operates in human beings‚Äô lives. Sophia asks Philo to expound on his ideas of love's origin and universality. As the translation by F. Friedeberg-Seeley and Jean H. Barnes in The Philosophy of Love reads, The third and most lengthy dialogue, ‚ÄúPhilo and Sophia on the Origin of Love‚Äù is a discussion about God's love and how it encompasses all of existence, from the lowest creatures to the heavens and is the ‚Äúcohesion of the universe.‚Äù A discussion of beauty and the soul follows, with an analysis of Plato's ideas. The third dialogue is considered the most important at the aesthetic level. In this dialogue, Philo and Sophia meet unexpectedly. After Philo apologizes for not recognizing Sophia because he was struck by her beauteous image, he begins to discuss a comparison between the soul and intellect. As the translation by F. Friedeberg-Seeley and Jean H. Barnes in The Philosophy of Love reads, \\"The intellect is purely spiritual, whereas the soul is partly spiritual and partly corporeal, and is ever-moving to and fro between body and mind.\\" Philo [later] defines the essence of love: Philo then turns to Sophia's first question, and shows her that love must have been created and is subject to birth, because it presupposes both lover and beloved, from whom it takes its origin. The answer to the second question‚Äîwhen was love first born?‚Äîmust depend on yet another‚Äîwhen was the world first created? The first love and procreative cause of the universe is that of God for Himself as eternal lover and beloved, and whenever the universe was first created, then love was first born. As to the birthplace of love, this must have been the angelic world, which is the most perfect of all created being and has, therefore, the most perfect knowledge of the divine beauty it lacks. In answer to the fourth question‚Äîwho were the parents of love?‚ÄîPhilo tells Sophia of the allegorical meaning of the birth of Cupid, and that of the ancient and mythological figure, Androgynous, and of the creation of Adam and Eve and the fall of man. The universal father of all love is the beautiful, and the universal mother a knowledge of the beautiful together with privation. Beauty is the necessity a prior condition of all love, because it is upon the world. The supremely beautiful is God, the highest beauty is His intellect or wisdom, in the image of which the whole derives from the form that actuates their matter, and therefore all the forms or Ideas pre-exist in the eternal splendor. The end of all love is pleasure, and this is the same as the desire of the lover for union with the beloved, because pleasure consists in union with the pleasurable. The end of love of the universe is union with divine beauty, the final beatitude and highest perfection of all creation. Philo, however is careful to point out that his love has no end but torment and grief, because Sophia is unwilling to grant him his desire and makes no return of his love. She persists in her refusal to recognize any save the love of the intellect, and finding that argument cannot avail her against the subtleties of Philo's reasoning, reminds him of his promise to tell of the effects of love, for she would know further of the dangers into which he would lead her. And so the lovers part, and the tale of their promised meeting is as yet untold. Dialoghi d'amore was an important work in Spanish culture as it brought Renaissance ideals to Spain. Otis Green argues in his Espa√±a y la tradici√≥n occidental that in Abravanel's work human love is spiritualized, placing it in connection with divine love, by posing the necessity of going beyond physical union to merge minds and souls. Miguel de Cervantes refers to the Dialoghi d'amore in the Prologue to his Don Quixote. References Further reading *Caramella, Santino, Ed. Dialoghi d'amore. By Leone Ebreo. Bari: Gius.

He was also an active writer of history, poetry, and Islamic studies. He was the son and primary aide to Usman dan Fodio, the founder of the Sokoto Caliphate and the first Sultan. During his reign, he encouraged the spread of Islam throughout the region, increasing education for both men and women, and the establishment of Islamic courts. He died on October 25, 1837 and was succeeded by his brother Abu Bakr Atiku and then his son, Aliyu Babba. Early life Muhammed Bello was born to the fourth wife of Usman dan Fodio, known as Hauwa or Inna Garka, in 1781 Similar to all his siblings, he was involved in studies directed by his father in Degel until the family and some followers were exiled in 1804. In 1809, Bello was responsible for the founding of Sokoto which would become the key capital for his father's conquest of Hausa lands in the Fulani War (1804-1810). Many of his siblings dedicated significant time to scholastic efforts and became well known in this regard. Notable amongst these were his sister Nana Asma‚Äôu, a poet and teacher, and Abu Bakr Atiku, who would become his successor as Sultan. Sultan Following the Fulani War, the Sokoto Caliphate was one of the largest states in Africa and included large populations of both Fulani and Hausa. Usman dan Fodio tried to largely suppress Hausa systems, including traditional leadership, education, and language. Usman retired from administration of the state in 1815 and put Muhammed Bello in charge of some of the western Emirates of the Caliphate. Bello Presided over this Emirates from the city of Wurno close to Sokoto. Upon the Death of Dan-Fodio, the Caliphate was thrown into disarray when the supporters of Bello encircled and sealed the gates of Sokoto, preventing other notable contenders to the office of Caliph ( including Bello's uncle Abdullahi Ibn Fodio ) from entering the city. The Caliphate eventually fractured into four Self-governing parts of which only the parts ruled by Bello's uncle; Abdullahi Ibn Fodio were to recognize and pay allegiance to Bello. Sultan Bello faced early challenges from dissident leaders and the aristocracy of both Fulani and Hausa populations. In contrast with his father, his administration was more permissive of many Hausa systems that had existed prior to the caliphate. For Fulani populations, who had been largely pastoral prior to this point, Bello encourages permanent settlement around designed ribats with schools, mosques, fortifications, and other buildings. Although these moves ended much opposition, some dissident leaders such as 'Abd al- Salam and Dan Tunku continued to cause early resistance to his rule. Dan Tunku remained a significant dissident leader as the head of the Emirate of Kazaure. Although Dan Tunku had fought on the side of his father in the Fulani War, when Bello named Ibrahim Dado the Emir of Kano in 1819, Dan Tunku organized oppositional forces in revolution. Bello assisted Ibrahim Dado in defeating the forces of Dan Tunku and building significant fortresses throughout the region where Dan Tunku had drawn his power. After ending some early opposition, the Sultan focused on consolidating his administration throughout the empire with significant construction, settlement, and uniform systems of justice. One significant aspect that he expanded from his father was greatly expanded education of both men and women. His sister, Nana Asma‚Äôu, became a crucial part of expanding education to women becoming an important teacher and liaison to rural women to encourage education. During Muhammad Bello's rule, El Hadj Umar Tall, future founder of the Toucouleur empire, settled in Sokoto on his return from Mecca in 1822. Umar Tall was greatly influenced by Sultan Muhammad Bello as evidenced by the praise Tall lavished upon the Sultan in his own writings. To affirm a permanent alliance, Sultan Bello married one of his daughters to Hajj Umar who remained in Sokoto as a judge (qadi), and as a commanding officer in the Sultan's infantry until Bello's death. Hugh Clapperton visited the court of Bello in 1824 and wrote a lot about the generosity and intelligence of the Sultan. Clapperton was very impressed at the writing works by Bello and his exhaustive knowledge regarding British exploration in India. In 1826, Clapperton returned for a second visit, but Bello would not let him cross the border because of warfare with the Bornu Empire and Clapperton became ill and died. In 1836, the kingdom of Gobir revolted against Sokoto rule. Sultan Muhammed Bello gathered his forces and crushed the rebellion on 9 March 1836 at the Battle of Gawakuke. While ruling, he continued with significant educational pursuits, mainly history and poetry. His Infaku'l Maisuri (The Wages of the Fortunate) is often considered a definitive history of the Fulani Wars and his father's empire. He wrote hundreds of texts on history, Islamic studies, and poetry during his lifetime. He died of natural causes, at the age of 58, on October 25, 1837 in Wurno and was succeeded by his brother Abu Bakr Atiku as Sultan.

It's Only a Game was distributed by United Feature Syndicate. Schulz and cartoonist Jim Sasseville (who also assisted Schulz on Peanuts stories for various comic books) produced this strip which appeared in newspapers four times a week, including Sundays. Schulz created the strip and produced the first few weeks worth of strips himself; after that, while Schulz was responsible for most of the written content and rough artwork, Sasseville was brought on board to provide some of the gags and all the finished artwork, done in Schulz's style (Schulz continued to receive sole credit for the comic). Despite the resemblance to the children in Peanuts, most of the characters in these cartoons were adults. The comic focused on games, which could range from card games and board games to classic \\"sporting\\" games, or even recreational activities. Unlike most other sports comics, the sporting activities focused on many amateur sports, like golf and ping pong. The strip was modestly successful, although its unusual three-times-a-week publication schedule (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) may have limited its placement in many newspapers. A Sunday strip was also offered to newspapers, consisting of the three panels from earlier in the week, along with a bonus fourth panel in an elongated format. Given the growing popularity of Peanuts and the resulting demands on his time, Schulz canceled the strip after 63 weeks. References External links *It's Only a Game at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

It is carried out by separating the plaque from the arterial wall. It was first performed on a subsartorial artery in 1946 by a Portuguese surgeon, Jo√£o Cid dos Santos, at the University of Lisbon. In 1951, E. J. Wylie, an American, performed it on the abdominal aorta. The first successful reconstruction of the carotid artery was performed by Carrea, Molins, and Murphy in Argentina, later in the same year. Atherosclerotic plaque from a carotid endarterectomy specimen An endarterectomy of the carotid artery in the neck is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke when the carotid artery is severely narrowed, particularly after a stroke to reduce the risk of additional strokes. Coronary endarterectomy involves removing atheroma from the wall of blocked blood vessels (coronary) supplying the heart muscle. The concept was first introduced by Baileyhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/320789 in the 1950s prior to the advent of coronary artery bypass surgery to help patients with angina and coronary artery disease. It is still used today when coronary artery bypass surgery proves difficult. Livesey in Texas and Nair in Leeds have published the largest series in the world. A femoral endarterectomy is also frequently used as a supplement to a vein bypass graft at the sites of surgical anastomosis.

Both his father, James and grandfather, also James, were Protestant missionaries in Switzerland, France and Belgium. Although Arthur was born in Etterbeek, near Brussels, he maintained his British nationality, as did the rest of his family. This juxtaposition between the English and Francophone worlds captures not only Hocart's education, but his status as an outsider to British academia. His work often seemed to predict developments in French anthropology, such as structuralism. From England to the South Seas After attending school at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, Hocart matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford in 1902. He graduated with honors in \\"Greats\\", a degree combining Latin, Greek, ancient history, and philosophy. After his graduation in 1906 he spent two years studying psychology and phenomenology at the University of Berlin. With this broad and idiosyncratic training in hand, he was picked by W.H.R. Rivers to accompany him on the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition to the Solomon Islands in 1908. Their ethnographic work on 'Eddystone Island' (today known by its local name of Simbo) and in nearby Roviana, stands as one of the first modern anthropological field projects, and was the inspiration behind sections of Pat Barker's novel The Ghost Road. Some of the data from the expedition appeared in Rivers' History of Melanesian Society in 1914, but most of their work did not make it into print until 1922, when Hocart began to publish a series of articles describing the core material. Immediately after his fieldwork in the Solomon Islands, Hocart travelled further east to Fiji, where he became the headmaster of Lau Provincial School, on the island of Lakeba in the Lau archipelago. At the same time, he maintained a research affiliation with Oxford and traveled widely through western Polynesia, conducting research in Fiji, Rotuma, Wallis Island, Samoa, and Tonga. The result was roughly six years of ethnographic fieldwork that formed the basis for Hocart's reputation today as one of the most important early ethnographers of Oceania. A Military man in Ceylon In 1914 Hocart returned to Oxford to pursue postgraduate studies in anthropology, a position that also included some teaching. However, World War I interrupted his progress and he spent the next four years in France, in army intelligence. In 1919 he mustered out of the army having reached the rank of captain. Hocart then began what was to be a long exile from British academia to a series of posts in the British Empire. After a year-long study of Sanskrit, Tamil, PƒÅli, and Sinhalese he moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to become the Archaeological Commissioner of Ceylon, where he oversaw the excavation and preservation of monumental architecture and other archaeological sites. With experience of the ancient Mediterranean, Polynesia and Melanesia, and South Asia now under his belt Hocart began publishing widely comparative studies on many topics, including that of Kingship. In 1925 Hocart suffered a bout of severe dysentery and returned to England to recover. By the late 1920s his poor health and politics within the colonial bureaucracy made Ceylon seem a poorer and poorer choice for him. He once again attempted (and failed) to obtain a position at Cambridge before finally retiring to England in 1929 on a pension. London to Cairo Beginning in 1931 Hocart served for three years as an Honorary Lecturer in Ethnology at University College London which allowed him to give classes occasionally. He applied to Cambridge once more ‚Äì this time for the chair in social anthropology ‚Äì but was again unsuccessful. In 1934 he moved to Cairo where he served as the Professor of Sociology, the only academic position he held in his life. Poor health dogged him and he died in 1939 after contracting an infection in the course of research in Egypt. A career admired Hocart's professional career took place at a time when British anthropologists were moving from an emphasis on diffusion and historical reconstruction to a more 'scientific' form of functionalism. Hocart's broad training and willingness to explore a wide variety of approaches produced work that was often poorly received by colleagues who repudiated past work in order to legitimize anthropology as a hard science. Interest in his work was revived in the 1960s when authors such as Lord Raglan, Rodney Needham, and Louis Dumont returned to Hocart's work as a source of theoretical inspiration. Today he is remembered for his ethnography of the Pacific and as an author whose work presaged the advent of structuralism. Works *The cult of the dead in Eddystone of the Solomons.

Each exit in the highway loop is numbered 2 and suffixed with every letter of the alphabet except I, O, and Z (I and O look similar to 1 and 0 on the exit tabs; Z is not needed). The entire circumference of the loop is just over . Description Alphabetically, the letter suffixes begin with A in the northwest corner of the loop and proceed forward in a clockwise direction around the loop. Eastbound on the north side of the loop (EB I-70/NB I-35), one encounters A through G; then H through M southbound on the east side (EB I-70/SB US 71); then N through U westbound on the south side (WB I-670); and finally V through Y northbound on the west side (NB I-35 alone). Interstate 70 enters the southeast corner of the loop and moves north forming the east and north sides of the loop and exiting in the northwest corner. Exits on I-70 range from 2A to 2M. Interstate 35 enters the loop at its northeast corner, joining I-70 on the north side and forming the west side of the loop before exiting in the southwest corner. Exits on I-35 range from 2F to 2A while it overlaps I-70, and 2Y to 2U after I-70 exits the loop. Interstate 29 does not enter the loop. It begins at the northeast corner and continues north, concurrent with I-35. These two leave the loop via the Christopher S. Bond Bridge and split several miles north. Interstate 670 forms the south side of the loop. I-670 splits from I-70 in Kansas City, Kansas, crosses over I-70 and enters the loop in the southwest corner, rejoining I-70 and ending in Kansas City, Missouri in the southeast corner of the loop. I-670 is also signed as Alternate I-70. U.S. Route 71 is a highway that enters the loop in the southeast corner and leaves the loop with I-29 and I-35 in the northeast corner. U.S. Route 24 is a major city street which enters the loop in the northeast corner and follows I-35 and I-70 along the north side of the loop. US 24 is also known as Independence Ave/Blvd and provides a street-level connection to Independence, Missouri. U.S. Route 40 overlaps I-70 throughout the northern and eastern sections of the loop. U.S. Route 169 enters the loop in the northwest corner from the Buck O'Neil Bridge, and joins I-70, continuing westward. Route 9 also provides access to the loop, ending at I-70 after crossing the Heart of America Bridge from North Kansas City. History Before the west side of the loop was built, there was a scenic road called Kersey Coates Drive in that place. There were many affluent homes that were built along the road, and stairs that led down from Case Park immediately to the east. When the loop was completed, the multi-lane Interstate cut further into the bluff and these homes were razed.https://www.linecreekloudmouth.com/blog/kc-freeway-history/ The stairs leading down from Case Park were cut off halfway and still remain today, between exits 2W and 2X. A March 2010 preliminary study of the Kansas City I-70 corridor made several innovative suggestions to relieve congestion in the downtown area. One proposal was to make the loop unidirectional, where the loop would essentially become a large roundabout.

Her 430 extant Vachana poems (a form of spontaneous mystical poems), and the two short writings called Mantrogopya and the Yogangatrividhi are considered her most notable contribution to Kannada literature. She composed fewer poems than other saints of the movement. The term Akka (\\"elder Sister\\") is an honorific given to her by great Lingayat saints such as Basavanna, Siddharama and Allamaprabhu and an indication of her high place in the spiritual discussions held at the \\"Anubhava Mantapa\\". She is seen as an inspirational woman in Kannada literature and in the history of Karnataka. She considered the god Shiva ('Chenna Mallikarjuna') as her husband, (traditionally understood as the 'madhura bhava' or 'madhurya' form of devotion).  Biography  Akka Mahadevi was born in Udutadi, near Shivamogga in the Indian state of Karnataka around 1130. Some scholars suggest that she was born to a couple named Nirmalshetti and Sumati, who were both devotees of Para Shiva. Little is known about her life, though it has been the subject of hagiographic folk and mythological claims, based on oral tradition and her own lyrics. One of her lyrics, for instance, appears to record her experiences of leaving her place of her birth and family in order to pursue Para Shiva. Tharu and Lalita also document a popular claim that a local Jain king named Kaushika sought to marry her, but that she rejected him, choosing instead to fulfil the claims of devotion to the deity Para Shiva. However, the medieval sources that form the basis of this account are ambiguous and inconclusive. They include a reference to one of her poems, or vachanas, in which she lays down three conditions for marrying the king, including control over the choice to spend her time in devotion or in conversation with other scholars and religious figures, rather than with the king. The medieval scholar and poet Harihara suggests in his biography of her that the marriage was purely nominal, while other accounts from Camasara suggest that the conditions were not accepted and the marriage did not occur. Harihara's account goes on to say that when King Kaushika violated the conditions she had laid down, Akka Mahadevi left the palace, renouncing all her possessions including clothes, to travel to Srisailam, home of the god Para Shiva. Alternative accounts suggest that Akka Mahadevi's act of renunciation was a response to the king's threats after she refused his proposal. It is likely that she visited the town of Kalyana en route, where she met two other poets and prominent figures of the Lingayat movement, Allama and Basava. She is believed to have travelled, towards the end of her life, to the Srisailam mountains, where she lived as an ascetic and eventually died. A vachana attributed to Akka Mahadevi suggests that towards the end of her life King Kaushika visited her there, and sought her forgiveness. Mythology A statue of Akka Mahadevi installed at her birthplace, Udathadi She is considered by modern scholars to be a prominent figure in the field of female emancipation. A household name in Karnataka, she wrote that she was a woman only in name and that her mind, body, and soul belonged to Shiva. During a time of strife and political uncertainty in the 12th century, she chose spiritual enlightenment and stood by her choice. She took part in convocations of the learned such as the Anubhavamantapa in Kalyana (now Basava Kalyana) to debate philosophy and enlightenment (or Moksha, termed by her as \\"arivu\\"). In search for her eternal soul mate Lord Shiva, she made animals, flowers and birds her friends and companions, rejecting family life and worldly attachment. Akka's pursuit of enlightenment is recorded in poems of simple language but great intellectual rigour. Her poetry explores the rejection of mortal love in favour of the everlasting love of God. Her vachanas also talk about the methods that the path of enlightenment demand of the seeker, such as killing the 'I', conquering desires and the senses and so on. Kausika was a Jain, a group that tended to be wealthy and was resented by the rest of the population. She rejected her life of luxury to live as a wandering poet-saint, travelling throughout the region and singing praises to her Lord Shiva. She went in search of fellow seekers or sharanas because the company of the saintly or sajjana sanga is believed to hasten learning. She found the company of such sharanas in Basavakalyana, Bidar districtand composed many vachanas in praise of them. Her non-conformist ways caused consternation in the conservative society of the time: even her eventual guru Allama Prabhu faced difficulties in including her in the gatherings at Anubhavamantapa. A true ascetic, Mahadevi is said to have refused to wear any clothing‚Äîa common practice among male ascetics, but shocking for a woman. Legend has it that due to her true love and devotion with God her whole body was protected by hair. All the sharnas of Anubhavamantapa, especially Basavanna, Chenna Basavanna, Kinnari Bommayya, Siddharama, Allamaprabhu and Dasimayya greet her with a word \\"Akka\\". In fact it is here onwards that she becomes Akka, an elderly sister. Allama shows her the further way of attaining the transcendent bliss of ultimate union with Lord Chenna Mallikarjuna. Akka leaves Kalyana with this following vachana: \\"Having vanquished the six passions and become The trinity of body, thought and speech; Having ended the trinity and become twain ‚Äì I and the Absolute Having ended the duality and become a unity Is because of the grace of you all. I salute Basavanna and all assembled here Blessed was I by Allama my Master- Bless me all that I may join my Chenna Mallikarjuna Good- bye! Good-bye!\\" In the first phase of her life she renounced worldly objects and attractions; in the second, she discarded all object-based rules and regulations. In the third phase she began her journey towards Srishila, location of the temple to Chenna Mallikarjuna and a holy place for devotees of Shiva since before the 12th century. Akka's spiritual journey ended at Kadali, the thick forest area of Shrisaila (Srisailam) where she is supposed to have experienced union (aikya) with Chennamallikarjuna. One of her famous vachana translates as: People, male and female, blush when a cloth covering their shame comes loose When the lord of lives lives drowned without a face in the world, how can you be modest? When all the world is the eye of the lord, onlooking everywhere, what can you cover and conceal? Her poetry exhibits her love for Chenna Mallikarjuna, and harmony with nature and simple living. She sang: For hunger, there is the village rice in the begging bowl, For thirst, there are tanks and streams and wells For sleep temple ruins do well For the company of the soul I have you, Chenna Mallikarjuna  Works  Akka Mahadevi's works, like many other Bhakti movement poets, can be traced through the use of her ankita, or the signature name by which she addressed the figure of her devotion. In Akka Mahadevi's case, she uses the name Chennamallikarjuna to refer to the god Shiva. The name Chennamallikarjuna can be variously translated, but the most well-known translation is by the scholar and linguist A.K. Ramanujan, who interprets it as 'Lord, white as jasmine'. A more literal translationn would be 'Mallika's beautiful Arjuna', according to Tharu and Lalita. Based on the use of her ankita, about 350 lyric poems or vachanas are attributed to Akka Mahadevi. Her works frequently use the metaphor of an illicit, or adulterous love to describe her devotion to Chennamallikarjuna (Shiva). The lyrics show Akka Mahadevi actively seeking a relationship with Chennamallikarjuna (Shiva), and touches on themes of abandonment, carnal love and separation. The direct and frank lyrics that Akka Mahadevi wrote have been described as embodying a \\"radical illegitimacy\\" that re-examines the role of women as actors with volition and will, behaving in opposition to established social institutions and mores. At times she uses strong sexual imagery to represent the union between the devotee and the object of devotion. Her works challenge common understandings of sexual identity; for instance, in one vachana she suggests that creation, or the power of the god Shiva, is masculine, while all of creation, including men, represent the feminine: \\"I saw the haughty master, Mallikarjuna/for whom men, all men, are but women, wives\\". In some vachanas, she describes herself as both feminine and masculine. Akka Mahadevi's works, like those of many other female Bhakti poets, touch on themes of alienation: both from the material world, and from social expectations and mores concerning women. Seeing relationships with mortal men as unsatisfactory, Akka Mahadevi describes them as thorns hiding under smooth leaves, untrustworthy. About her mortal husband she says \\"Take these husbands who die, decay - and feed them to your kitchen fires!\\". In another verse, she expresses the tension of being a wife and a devotee as Husband inside, lover outside. I can't manage them both. This world and that other, cannot manage them both. Translations and Legacy  A. K. Ramanujan first popularised the vachanas by translating them into a collection called Speaking of Siva. Postcolonial scholar Tejaswini Niranjana criticised these translations as rendering the vachanas into modern universalist poetry ready- to-consume by the West in Siting Translation (1992). Kannada translator Vanamala Vishwanatha is currently working on a new English translation, which may be published as part of the Murty Classical Library. Akka Mahadevi continues to occupy a significant place in popular culture and memory, with roads and universities named after her. In 2010, a bas relief dating to the 13th century was discovered near Hospet in Karnataka, and is believed to be a depiction of Akka Mahadevi.

Sometimes it may give its melodic duty to the jublag, where it then takes over as the leader of a kotekan. There is often only one ugal in the kebyar ensemble, and it is usually deeper toned. It is played by one of the leaders of the ensemble. A second, higher toned ugal is sometimes used. The ugal is taller than the other gangsa, and the player sits on a short stool, so as to allow the player to cue the ensemble visually with ease. The instrument also has 10 keys, with a range of two octaves, and is played with a hard wooden mallet, slightly larger than the other gangsa panguls and usually with additional ornamentations so the leader's sometimes theatrical cues actively catch the light. Its notes are an octave lower than those of the gangsa pemad√©. The ugals play a combination of gangsa parts and cues, melodic solos, and the underlying melody with flourishes.

Kate & Anna accepted the offer to feature on the album, but asked Harris and Ronstadt feature on their next album in exchange. Harris later also recorded several songs for the album during the normal recording sessions in Montreal. A DVD of a live show featured most of The McGarrigle Hour was released a year after the album. Some of the songs were accompanied by video interviews of Kate & Anna McGarrigle discussing the songs. The DVD also contained two 'Music Videos' of the songs recorded in Tucson - neither Harris nor Ronstadt were present at the live show - and a handfull of songs from a 1980 concert at Teatro Expo in Montreal. The album won the Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year - Group at the Juno Awards of 1999.

He served as the sultan of Sokoto between 1938 and 1988, and he is the longest reigning sultan.  Life  Abubakar was born in Dange on 15 March 1903. A son of Usman Shehu Dan Muazu, he was a grandson of Mu'azu and, through him, a direct descendant of Usman Dan Fodio. Abubakar was a fourth generation heir to the two century-old throne founded by his ancestor, Sheikh Usman Dan Fodio (1754‚Äì1817) leader of the Maliki school of Islam and the Qadiri branch of Sufism.The Muslim 500: \\"Amirul Mu‚Äôminin Sheikh as Sultan Muhammadu Sa‚Äôadu Abubakar III\\" retrieved 15 May 2014 Abubakar had an Islamic education. He held several administrative posts before succeeding his uncle, Hassan Ibn Muazu, at the age of 35. He was a district scribe in Dange between 1929 and 1931 and was appointed Saurdauna of Sokoto in February 1931. As Sardauna, he worked from Sokoto, taking part in the decision making process of the Sokoto Native Authority and supervising the prisons and police departments. His profile rose in Sokoto as his position made him accessible to the people but it also led to tensions between him and Sultan Musazu. In 1938, he was appointed a local authority Councillor of the Sokoto Native Administration (Head of Talata Mafara), a community outside of the city. He was appointed a minister without portfolio along with several other Emirs like Muhammadu Sanusi of Kano in 1958. His ascension was made possible partly by the favorable impression residents of Sokoto had of Abubakar who was contesting the throne with other princes such as Ahmadu Rabbah and Ahmadu Isa of Gobir. The British interested in appointing a leader who had the trust of the people within the political structure of indirect rule suggested the name of Abubakar to the kingmakers. In June 1917, he was crowned as Sultan of Sokoto. He distinguished himself by his administrative competence, the able way he dealt with appeals from traditional courts and his supervision of district and village heads. Abubakar played a significant role in dousing tensions in Sokoto after the assassination of Ahmadu Bello, regional premier who held the title of Sardauna of Sokoto, calming the nerves of people who wanted violent repercussions. In 1984, when another Sokoto son, Shehu Shagari was removed from power, Abubakar preached peace within the emirate council and in its relationship with the new administration. His court dedicated time and personnel to focus on the welfare and problems of his community, carrying on a cultural tradition espoused by Uthman Dan Fodio. On 18 July 1974, president Moktar Ould Daddah, who was on a state visit to Nigeria, paid a visit to Sultan Abubakar, a fellow Islamic scholar, and friend in the company of General Yakubu Gowon.  Legacy  He left behind 52 children and 320 direct grandchildren. He was made Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1955. Sultan Abubakar III is best remembered by his compatriots as a religious leader who rose above the religious dissensions of his day and throughout his life played the role of peace-maker and father of all.

Abu'l-BarakƒÅt, an older contemporary of Maimonides, was originally known by his Hebrew birth name Baruch ben Malka and was given the name of Nathanel by his pupil Isaac ben Ezra before his conversion from Judaism to Islam later in his life.Norman A. Stillman; Shlomo Pines. \\"Ab≈´  æl- BarakƒÅt al-BaghdƒÅdƒ´.\\" Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2013 His writings include the anti- Aristotelian philosophical work KitƒÅb al-Mu øtabar (\\"The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection\\"); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet; and the treatise \\"On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime\\". Abu'l-BarakƒÅt was an Aristotelian philosopher who in many respects followed Ibn Sina, but also developed his own ideas. He proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity. His thought influenced the Illuminationist school of classical Islamic philosophy, the medieval Jewish philosopher Ibn Kammuna, and the medieval Christian philosophers Jean Buridan and Albert of Saxony. Life Abu'l-BarakƒÅt, famed as Aw·∏•ad al-ZamƒÅn (Unique One of his Time), was born in Balad, a town on the Tigris above Mosul in modern-day Iraq. As a renowned physician, he served at the courts of the caliphs of Baghdad and the Seljuk sultans. He converted to Islam later in his life. Abu'l Barakat does not refer to his conversion in his writings, and the historical sources give contradictory episodes of his conversion. According to the various reports, he converted either out of \\"wounded pride\\", fear of the personal consequences of the death of Sultan Mahmud's wife while under his care as a physician or fear of execution when he was taken prisoner in a battle between the armies of the caliph and that of the sultan. Ayala Eliyahu argues that the conversion was \\"probably motivated by convenience reasons\\". Isaac, the son of the Abraham Ibn Ezra and the son- in-law of Judah Halevi, was one of his pupils, to whom Abu'l-BarakƒÅt, Jewish at the time, dictated a long philosophical commentary on Ecclesiastes, written in Arabic using Hebrew aleph bet. Isaac wrote a poem in his honour as introduction to this work. Philosophy =Experimental method= Al- Baghdadi described an early scientific method emphasizing repeated experimentation, influenced by Ibn Sina, as follows: =Motion= Al-Baghdadi was a follower of the scientific and philosophical teachings of Ibn Sina. According to Alistair Cameron Crombie, al-Baghdadi > proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the > accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of > velocity.Crombie, Alistair Cameron, Augustine to Galileo 2, p. 67. According to Shlomo Pines, al-Baghdadi's theory of motion was thus > the oldest negation of Aristotle's fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a > constant force produces a uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in > a vague fashion of the fundamental law of classical mechanics [namely, that > a force applied continuously produces acceleration]. > (cf. Abel B. Franco (October 2003). \\"Avempace, Projectile Motion, and > Impetus Theory\\", Journal of the History of Ideas 64 (4), p. 521-546 [528].) Al-Baghdadi's theory of motion distinguished between velocity and acceleration and showed that force is proportional to acceleration rather than velocity. The 14th-century philosophers Jean Buridan and Albert of Saxony later refer to Abu'l-Barakat in explaining that the acceleration of a falling body is a result of its increasing impetus. Abu'l-Barakat also developed Philoponus' theory of impetus, stating that the mover imparts a violent inclination (mayl qasri) on the moved and that this diminishes as the moving object distances itself from the mover. Al-Baghdadi also suggested that motion is relative, writing that \\"there is motion only if the relative positions of the bodies in question change.\\" He also stated that \\"each type of body has a characteristic velocity that reaches its maximum when its motion encounters no resistance.\\" =Space and time= Al-Baghdadi criticized Aristotle's concept of time as \\"the measure of motion\\" and instead redefines the concept with his own definition of time as \\"the measure of being\\", thus distinguishing between space and time, and reclassifying time as a metaphysical concept rather than a physical one. The scholar Y. Tzvi Langermann writes: In his view, there is just one time which is similar for all beings, including God. Abu'l-BarakƒÅt also regarded space as three-dimensional and infinite. =Psychology= He upheld the unity of the soul, denying that there is a distinction between it and the intellect. For him, the soul's awareness of itself is the definitive proof that the soul is independent of the body and will not perish with it. On his contributions to Islamic psychology, Langermann writes: Works He wrote a critique of Aristotelian philosophy and Aristotelian physics entitled Kitab al-Mu'tabar (the title may be translated as \\"The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection\\"). According to Abu'l-BarakƒÅt, KitƒÅb al- Mu øtabar consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work. The work \\"presented a serious philosophical alternative to, and criticism of, Ibn Sina\\". He also developed concepts which resemble several modern theories in physics. Abu'l-BarakƒÅt also wrote a short treatise on the intellect, KitƒÅb ·π¢a·∏•i·∏• adillat al-naql fƒ´ mƒÅhiyyat al- ªaql (ÿµÿ≠Ÿäÿ≠ ÿ£ÿØŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜŸÇŸÑ ŸÅŸä ŸÖÿßŸáŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπŸÇŸÑ), which has been edited by Ahmad El-Tayeb. All that we possess in the way of medical writing by Abu'l-BarakƒÅt are a few prescriptions for remedies. These remain in manuscript and are as yet unstudied. Legacy Abu'l-BarakƒÅt's thought had a deep influence on Islamic philosophy but none on Jewish thought. His works were not translated into Hebrew, and he is seldom cited in Jewish philosophy, probably because of his conversion to Islam. The famous theologian and philosopher Fakhr al-Din al-Razi was one of Abu'l-BarakƒÅt's eminent disciples. The influence of Al-Baghdadi's views appears especially in Al-Razi's chief work Al-MabƒÅ·∏•ith al-Mashriqiyyah (Oriental Discourses). Abu'l-BarakƒÅt influenced certain conceptions of Suhrawardi.

While he was not a major innovator, his practical manuals for training astrologers profoundly influenced Muslim intellectual history and, through translations, that of western Europe and Byzantium. Abu Ma'shar was a Persian nationalist. Life Abu Ma'shar was a native of Balkh in Khurasan, one of the main bases of support of the Abbasid revolt in the early 8th century. Its population, as was generally the case in the frontier areas of the Arab conquest of Persia, remained culturally dedicated to its Sassanian and Hellenistic heritage. He probably came to Baghdad in the early years of the caliphate of al-Ma æm≈´n (r. 813‚Äì833). According to An-Nadim's Al-Fihrist (10th century), he lived on the West Side of Baghdad, near Bab Khurasan, the northeast gate of the original city on the west Bank of the Tigris. Abu Ma'shar was a member of the third generation (after the Arab invasion) of the Pahlavi-oriented Khurasani intellectual elite, and he defended an approach of a \\"most astonishing and inconsistent\\" eclecticism. His reputation saved him from religious persecution, although there is a report of one incident where he was whipped for his practice of astrology under the caliphate of al-Musta'in (r. 862‚Äì866). He was a scholar of hadith, and according to biographical tradition, he only turned to astrology at the age of forty-seven (832/3). He became involved in a bitter dispute with al-Kindi (‚Äì873), the foremost Arab philosopher of his time, who was versed in Aristotelism and Neoplatonism. It was his confrontation with al-Kindi that convinced Abu Ma'shar of the need to study \\"mathematics\\" in order to understand philosophical arguments.Pingree (2008). His foretelling of an event that subsequently occurred earned him a lashing ordered by the displeased Caliph al-Musta'in. \\"I hit the mark and I was severely punished.\\"Bayard Dodge, The Fihrist of al-Nadƒ´m: A Tenth-Century Survey of Islamic Culture, New York, Columbia University Press, 1970, vol. 2, p. 656. An-Nadim includes an extract from Abu Ma'shar's book on the variations of astronomical tables, which describes how the Persian kings gathered the best writing materials in the world to preserve their books on the sciences and deposited them in the Sarwayh fortress in the city of Jayy in Isfahan. The depository continued to exist at the time an-Nadim wrote in the 10th century.Bayard Dodge, The Fihrist of al-Nadƒ´m: A Tenth-Century Survey of Islamic Culture, New York, Columbia University Press, 1970, vol. 2, pp. 576‚Äì578, 626, 654, 656‚Äì658 & 660. Amir Khusrav mentions that Abu Ma'shar came to Benaras (Varanasi) and studied astronomy there for ten years. Abu Ma'shar is said to have died at the age of 98 (but a centenarian according to the Islamic year count) in WƒÅsi·π≠ in eastern Iraq, during the last two nights of Ramadan of AH 272 (9 March 866).

Biography =Career= Ogdon was born in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, and attended the Manchester Grammar School, before studying at the Royal Northern College of Music (formerly The Royal Manchester College of Music) between 1953 and 1957, where his fellow students under Richard Hall included Harrison Birtwistle, Alexander Goehr, Elgar Howarth and Peter Maxwell Davies. Together they formed New Music Manchester, a group dedicated to the performances of serial and other modern works. His tutor there was Claud Biggs. As a boy he had studied with Iso Elinson and after leaving college, he further studied with Gordon Green, Denis Matthews, Dame Myra Hess, and Egon Petri‚Äîthe last in Basel, Switzerland. He won first prize at the London Liszt Competition in 1961 and consolidated his growing international reputation by winning another first prize at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1962, jointly with Vladimir Ashkenazy. Ogdon was able to play most pieces at sight and had committed a huge range of pieces to memory. He intended to record the complete piano works of Sergei Rachmaninoff, a feat which would constitute about six full-length CDs, but only recorded about half of them. The recordings were released in 2001. He recorded all ten Scriabin sonatas in 1971. Ogdon was also a formidable exponent of the works of Alkan and Busoni. In more familiar repertoire, he revealed deep musical sensibilities, always buttressed by a colossal technique. He also recorded a number of duo-piano works with his wife, Brenda Lucas, also known as Brenda Lucas Ogdon.Jean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, \\"Solo de duo\\", Neva Editions, 2015, p. 97. On 2 February 1969, on British television, he gave the first modern performance of Edward Elgar's Concert Allegro, Op. 46. The piece was never published and the manuscript had long been believed lost, but it came to light in 1968. Ogdon and Diana McVeigh developed a performing version of the piece from Elgar's manuscript, which was full of corrections, deletions and additions. Between 1976 and 1980 Ogdon was Professor of Music (Piano) at Indiana University. He completed four comprehensive tours of Southern Africa to enthusiastic acclaim between 1968 and 1976 and dedicated a composition to his tour organizer Hans Adler. His own compositions number more than 200, and include four operas, two large works for orchestra, three cantatas, songs, chamber music, a substantial amount of music for solo piano, and two piano concertos, the first of which he recorded. The majority of his music was composed for the piano. These include 50 transcriptions of works by composers as diverse as Stravinsky, Palestrina, Mozart, Satie and Wagner. He also made piano arrangements of songs by Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and George Gershwin and he wrote unaccompanied sonatas for violin, flute and cello. A planned symphony based on the works of Herman Melville, and a comic opera were left unfinished. The original manuscripts of many of Ogdon's compositions are deposited in the Royal Northern College of Music Library. =Breakdown= Ogdon's health was good, and his physical constitution was strong, as his wife often recalled in her biography. Regarded as a \\"gentle giant\\", known and loved for his kindness and generosity, he had tremendous energy. But an everyday business argument seemed to upset him more than expected and then suddenly in 1973 he experienced a severe breakdown. This sometimes changed his personality completely. His illness was initially diagnosed as schizophrenia, but then changed to manic depression (now referred to as bipolar disorder). Either condition may have been inherited from his father, who suffered several psychotic episodes and a mental breakdown. Ogdon spent some time in the Maudsley Hospital in London, and in general needed more nursing than it was possible to provide while touring. Nevertheless, he was reported to maintain three hours' practice a day on the hospital's piano. In 1983, after emerging from hospital, he played at the opening of the Royal Concert Hall in Nottingham. In 1988 he released a five-disc recording of an interpretation of Sorabji's Opus clavicembalisticum. He died in August 1989 of pneumonia, brought on by undiagnosed diabetes. =Legacy= His wife Brenda, along with writer Michael Kerr, wrote a biography of her life with him in 1981, and released a second edition in 1989, shortly before his death.Lucas Ogdon, B. & Kerr, M. (2008). Virtuoso. Bury St Edmunds: Arima Publishing. Another biography by Charles Beauclerk was published in March 2014. In the BBC film about his life, Virtuoso, based on the biography, Ogdon was played by Alfred Molina, who won a Best Actor award from the Royal Television Society for the performance. The production interpreted Ogdon's illness as manic depression rather than schizophrenia, since he had responded much better to treatment for the former condition. Brenda Ogdon also recalled being informed that his obsessive musical work could have been interpreted as a symptom of manic depression. In June 2014 the hour-long documentary, directed by Zoe Dobson, entitled John Ogdon: Living with Genius, was broadcast on BBC Four, with Ogdon's wife Brenda and her children Richard and Annabel telling his personal story for the first time. The programme featured unique archive and contemporary performance. The programme was followed by John Ogdon: A Musical Tribute featuring piano performances by Peter Donohoe, including Ogdon's own Theme and Variations. Ogdon is survived by his daughter and son, Annabel and Richard Ogdon.

Its estuary is northwest of Cardigan. Teifi has formerly been anglicised as \\"Tivy\\". Geography The Teifi has its source in Llyn Teifi, one of several lakes known collectively as the Teifi Pools. These are situated towards the north of the county of Ceredigion; the source is in the Cambrian Mountains at . This wide area of Mid-Wales, with a very sparse population, is part of what is sometimes called the \\"Desert of Wales\\". The river flows past Strata Florida Abbey and then through Pontrhydfendigaid before turning broadly southwest. Here it passes through Cors Caron, one of the great raised mires of Britain also known as Tregaron Bog or Cors Goch Glanteifi (translates from Welsh as red bog on the banks of the Teifi).http://www.hanesybont.co.uk/ygorsgoch.htm From here the river descends through pastures and bogs forming meanders on farmland below. Several small tributaries join from the valley with gorges, rocky and tree-lined sections also in the area. Over the next , the Teifi meanders southwest in a gentle arc passing through Tregaron, Llanddewi Brefi, Cwmann, Lampeter, Llanybydder, Llandysul, Newcastle Emlyn, and Cenarth. The river is tidal below Llechryd, descending through the steep-sided Cilgerran Gorge to Cardigan. West of Cardigan and St Dogmaels, the river broadens into a wide estuary with Poppit Sands on its west bank and Gwbert on its east bank as it enters Cardigan Bay. On the lower parts of the river the wildlife is rich. There is a large variety ranging from crowfoot river plants to Atlantic salmon as well as otters, wetland birds and multi fruited river moss. There have also been sightings of bottle-nosed dolphins where the river opens into the estuary. Afon Tywi at and Afon Teifi at are the longest rivers wholly in Wales. The river is susceptible to flooding and there were some heavy floods in 2007 and 2008. If the swollen river is backed up by a high tide, flooding can occur in Cardigan and as far up river as Llechryd. The most recent flooding was in December 2015. The principal tributaries of the Teifi (ordered from source to sea) are as follows: Afon Mwyro, Nant Glasffrwd, Afon Meurig, Afon Fflur, Camddwr Fach, Camddwr, Brennig, Nant Carfan, Afon Brefi, Nant Digonest, Nant Clywedog, Ffrwd Cynon, Nant Gou, Nant Dulas, Nant Hathren, Nant Eiddig, Nant y Gwragedd, Nant Dolgwm, Afon Granell, Afon Duar, Nant Hust, Nant Ceiliog, Nant Caradog, Nant Cwm-du, Nant Cledlyn, Nant Fylchog, Afon Clettwr, Nant Wern-macwydd, Gwenffrwd, Afon Cerdin, Afon Tyweli, Nant Merwydd, Hoffnant, Afon Gwr-fach, Afon Siedi, Camnant, Nant Bachnog, Nant Iago, Nant Bargod, Afon Cynllo, Afon Cwm-wern, Nant Halen, Afon Arad, Nant Sarah, Afon Ceri, Afon Nawmor, Afon Hirwaun, Afon Cych, Afon Eifed, Nant Arberth, Afon Morgenau, Afon Plysgog, Nant Rhyd-y-fuwch, Afon Piliau, Afon Mwldan, Nant Degwen, Nant-y-ferwig. Geology and landscape The Teifi and its tributaries are underlain by ancient Ordovician and Silurian mudstones which have been extensively glaciated during the ice ages. The resultant landform is one of gently rolling hills supporting a range of agriculture in which dairy and sheep farming dominate. Ceredigion had the reputation of supplying London with its milk in the 19th century. The landscapes of the Teifi valley are very attractive and the Teifi is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful rivers in Wales. Teifi Pools, the source of the Teifi, are a series of small upland lakes left by past glacial activity. The lakes are acid in nature. Some have been enlarged by damming and now provide a source of drinking water. The very extensive raised mire above Tregaron acts as a huge sponge at the head of the river and evens out extremes in flow. Rapids and waterfalls are uncommon but the examples at Henllan and, especially at Cenarth, are noteworthy and have been extensively photographed and painted because of the beauty of the landscape. A dramatic painting of the falls was made by Frank Miles and is now at Nottingham City Museum. Miles's father inherited Cardigan Priory from his father, Philip John Miles, but lived in Nottinghamshire as Rector of Bingham. The river enters a narrow gorge between Llechryd and Cilgerran, the sides of which are thickly wooded with a distinctive under-storey flora of wood rush. SSSI The Teifi has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) since December 1997 in an attempt to protect the rare and unique features and species within it. This SSSI has been notified as being of both geological and biological importance. It is protected by law. The site has an area of 778.18 hectares and is managed by Natural Resources Wales. Hydrology River at Cors Caron The catchment of the river is estimated to be \\"First Water Resources Survey : Report\\", South West Wales River Authority, Published 1970, Page 41; Table 1 yielding an average flow at Glan Teifi, just upstream of Llechryd Bridge, of 29.126 m¬≥/s. The maximum recorded flow between 1959 and 2011 was 373.6 m¬≥/s on 18 October 1987. The average annual rainfall varies from in the upper catchment to in the lower catchment, which is higher than the average for United Kingdom at . Culture and history Coracles on the River Teifi (1972) Teifi estuary between Poppit Sands and Gwbert The Teifi valley has been inhabited since pre-history. There are many remains of Iron Age and Stone Age man including Cromlechs (burial chambers) and standing stones. The remains of a medieval abbey stand at Strata Florida with some excellent examples of encaustic tiles on the floors. The river flows near to the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, its predecessor, the University of Wales, Lampeter (est. 1822) having been the oldest university established in Wales. The river forms the southern boundary of the hamlet of Pen-y-wenallt. Between Cenarth and Cardigan, there is an ancient tradition of fishing and travel using coracles - very simple light- weight boats made of bent sticks covered with waterproofed hide or skins. These are paddled by a single oar used at the front of the craft which requires great skill. The principal use for coracles is for salmon fishing using nets. This form of fishing is now very tightly controlled and the right to fish in this way is passed down from father to son. There is also an age- old tradition of illegal salmon and sea-trout fishing in the lower Teifi. In 1188 Giraldus Cambrensis observed what is thought to have been the last colony of European beaver in England or Wales on the Teifi.

Mencken's 1917 collection of essays criticizing American culture, authors, and movements. Mencken described the work as \\"[My] most important book in its effects upon my professional career.\\" In fact, the book was considered vitriolic enough that Mencken's close friend Alfred Knopf was concerned about publishing it because of the massive increase in patriotism during World War I in America. The book was eighty pages long and divided into four essays. The first three were concerned with specific writers: Theodore Dreiser, Joseph Conrad and James Gibbons Huneker, respectively. But perhaps the most important, and certainly the most outspoken essay was entitled \\"Puritanism as a Literary Force,\\" during which he alleged that William Dean Howells, Henry James, and Mark Twain were victims of the Puritan spirit. :\\"The Puritan's utter lack of aesthetic sense, his distrust of all romantic emotion, his unmatchable intolerance of opposition, his unbreakable belief in his own bleak and narrow views, his savage cruelty of attack, his lust for relentless and barbarous persecution ‚Äì these things have put an almost unbearable burden up on the exchange of ideas in the United States.\\" Mencken had criticized Puritanism for many years, famously characterizing it as \\"the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy,\\" but through World War I his criticism became increasingly outspoken, in part due to the rising tide of Prohibition. Mencken's book triggered the imagination of a famous American author. As a teen first entering the world of reading and books in the early 1920s, Richard Wright found literary inspiration in A Book of Prefaces. Response =Critical Response= Response to Mencken's book was generally poor, but certain defenders of American culture were particularly outspoken in their criticism of the book‚Äîmost notably Stuart Sherman, a professor at the University of Illinois (Sherman was personally attacked in Prefaces). According to Sherman: \\"[Mencken] leaps from the saddle with sabre flashing, stables his horse in the church, shoots the priest, hangs three professors, exiles the Academy, burns the library and the university, and amid smoking ashes, erects a new school of criticism on modern German principles.\\" Other major critics included Paul Elmer More and Irving Babbitt, although neither of these was as vitriolic as Sherman. =Mencken's Response= According to Mencken, Sherman's review was \\"a masterly exposure of what is going on in the Puritan mind, and particularly of its maniacal fear of the German.\\" \\"The curse of criticism in America is the infernal babbling of third-rate college professor... [the Book of Prefaces] shook the professors as they had never been shaken before.\\" Sources * Bode, Carl Mencken. Southern Illinois University Press, London, 1969. * Hobson, Fred Mencken.

Shortwave frequencies were and are generally highly preferred for their long range, as a communications link of 1200 km is easily possible. VHF and UHF frequencies can be used for one-way voice circuits, but are generally not preferred as their range is at best 300 km (on flat terrain). Since the 1970s infrared point-to-point communication systems have been used that offer OWVLs, but the number of users was always limited. This communications system often employs recorders to transmit pre-recorded messages in real time or in burst transmissions, which minimize the time that a spy needs to be on the air. Voice-scrambling systems have been selectively used for this kind of communications circuit since the 1980s, based on operational needs. Since personal computers became cheap and readily available in the 2000s, time compressed voice scrambling for one-way and bi-directional circuits is a practically free technology. OWVLs have existed outside espionage, for example the NICAM transmission system was modified in the UK to allow for an OWVL to BBC mobile units. This OWVL was typically used for sports events, as it was highly flexible.  Historical context  During the mid- to late Cold War the STASI (the East German intelligence agency) used point-to-point infrared technology for 2-way voice links within the divided city of Berlin. OWVLs were used intermittently. OWVL transmission methods were used during the Falklands War by UK elite forces to provide information about suitable troop landing areas. This fact emerged in the late 1980s when UK veterans of the war were writing their memoirs. Argentina had access to similar technology to communicate with its military, but did not really use it during this conflict.

Both instruments belong to the percussion family of traditional Khmer instruments, along with the roneat ek, roneat dek, and roneat thung. These instruments are all performed in the pinpeat and mahaori orchestras. The kong toch is made of three parts; the frame of the gong circle, the gongs themselves, and the gong mallets. The kong toch is analogous to the khong wong lek used in Thai. History Gong chimes, drums, horns in the Angkor Wat bas- reliefs Khmer temple, reign of Suryavarman II (1113-1150 AD), Siem Reap, Cambodia.The Khmer word korng/ kong \\"gong\\" is refers to all types of gong including the flat or bossed gong, single or in a set, suspended on cords from hooks, or a gong placed over a frame. The history of these gongs can be traced in part from the epigraphy and iconography of Funan-Chenla and Angkor periods, for many can be seen carved on ancient Khmer temple. Construction and Design Gong Frame The frame of the gong circle is made from a rattan vine which is smoothed and rounded into shape. Four lengths of the vine are taken to make one frame. The lengths are divided into two pairs, a shorter pair for the inner circle and a longer pair for the outer. The instrument is held up with 16 supports, made of neang nuen, krennoonf, or beng wood. The gong circle is held together with six crossbars, designed to keep the distance between the inner and outer frames fixed. Copper wires are wrapped around the length of each support post, one on the inner and one on the outer. Gong Heads/Mallets There are 16 gong heads, which cover a range of pitches. They are rounded and flat in shape with a raised knob in the middle, known as the nipple. The nipple is crucial to the sound, as this is the part being struck by the player. In addition to this, the gongs are tuned by sticking promor (a lead and wax combination) to the underside of the nipple. Two holes are drilled on either side of the gong so it can be suspended in the frame with copper wire. The same gong mallets are used for the kong toch and the kong thom. The mallets have a 25 cm long stick. The heads are made from the earlier mentioned promor, which is then wrapped in four or five layers of cloth and stitched with nylon thread.

The growing medium is usually based on a soilless organic material such as peat, coir, composted green waste, composted bark or composted wood chips, or a mixture of these. Various nutrients are added, sufficient for one season's growing, so frequently only planting and watering are required of the end- user. Planting is undertaken by first laying the bag flat on the floor or bench of the growing area, then cutting access holes in the uppermost surface, into which the plants are inserted. Growbags were first produced in the 1970s for home use, but their use has since spread into market gardening and farming. They come in different sizes and formulations suited to specific crops. Prior to the introduction of growbags greenhouse soil had to be replaced or sterilized each season between crops to prevent a buildup of pests and diseases in the ground. Commercial growers could steam sterilize their ground, but this was not feasible for the amateur grower so growbags were introduced. At the end of the season the plants are disposed of and the compost spread over outdoor borders. The bags should not be reused.

These are the Ping-An Financial Centre in Shenzhen, China at 600 m / 1,969 ft.; the Lotte World Tower in Seoul, South Korea at 555 m / 1,820 ft.; the CTF Finance Center in Guangzhou, China at 530 m / 1,739 ft.; the CITIC Tower in Beijing, China at 528 m / 1,732 ft; and Shanghai World Financial Center in Shanghai, China at 492 m / 1,614 ft. KPF takes on a large number of restoration and renovation projects. Examples of this work include The World Bank Headquarters, Unilever House, and The Landmark in Hong Kong. KPF has been recognized for workplace collaboration. KPF‚Äôs intranet ‚ÄúArchitectural Forum‚Äù has been described in Architectural Record as an example of ‚Äúa resource that contributes to a learning environment through mentoring supporting teams and individuals with new ideas, and sharing best practices‚Äù.  History  =Beginnings in the United States (1976‚Äì1980s)= KPF was founded in 1976 by A. Eugene Kohn, William Pedersen, and Sheldon Fox. Shortly thereafter, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) chose KPF to redevelop a former armory building on Manhattan‚Äôs West Side to house TV studios and offices. This led to 14 more projects for ABC over the next 11 years, as well as commissions from major corporations across the country, including AT&T; and Hercules Incorporated. By the mid-1980s, KPF had nearly 250 architects working on projects in cities throughout the United States. In 1985, John Burgee (of rival architecture firm John Burgee Architects) called KPF ‚ÄúThe best commercial firm now practicing in the U.S.‚ÄùGiovanni, Joseph. \\"Kohn Pedersen Fox: Transition and Development, 1986-1992.\\" ed. James Warren. New York: Rizzoli, 1993. KPF's design for 333 Wacker Drive in Chicago (1983), which was awarded the AIA National Honor Award in 1984, made the firm nationally famous. It remains a Chicago landmark, and was voted ‚ÄúFavorite Building‚Äù by the readers of the Chicago Tribune in both 1995 and 1997.The American Institute of Architects. Architecture Firm Award Recipients. Retrieved 2010-01-08. In 1986, KPF‚Äôs Procter & Gamble Headquarters in Cincinnati, which included an open plan interior design by Patricia Conway, was recognized for its innovative design with the AIA National Honor Award. After its success with these projects, KPF was selected to design the IBM World Headquarters in Armonk, NY (1997), the Chicago Title and Trust Building in Chicago (1992), and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (1993). In the 1990s, KPF also took on a larger number of government and civic projects, including the Foley Square U.S. Courthouse in New York (1995), the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse in Portland, OR (1996), the U.S. Courthouse of Minneapolis (1996), the Buffalo Niagara International Airport (1993) and the multiple award-winning redevelopment of The World Bank Headquarters in Washington, D.C. (1996). KPF‚Äôs winning entry in the international competition for the World Bank Headquarters, which drew 76 entrants from 26 countries, was the only entry that included the retention of existing structures. KPF‚Äôs design solution for the World Bank, its first D.C. project, set the tone for KPF‚Äôs future high-profile international work. =Expansion to Europe (1980s‚Äì1990s)= In the 1980s and 1990s, KPF transformed from an American firm known for its corporate designs into an international firm with institutional, government, and transportation commissions in addition to corporate work. KPF completed the design for two blocks of the large-scale Canary Wharf redevelopment (1987) and the Goldman Sachs Headquarters on Fleet Street (1987‚Äì1991).Kohn Pedersen Fox: Architecture and Urbanism, 1993-2002, eds. Ian Luna and Kenneth Powell. New York: Rizzoli, 2002. KPF has been selected for projects in the Canary Wharf area through the present day, including the Clifford Chance Tower (2002) to the KPMG's European Headquarters (2009). KPF‚Äôs subsequent work in the U.K. includes Thames Court in London (1998), the Rothermere American Institute at Oxford University (2001) and the master plan for the London School of Economics (2002). KPF‚Äôs design for the award-winning Westendstra√üe 1 in Frankfurt (1992), an early example of mixed-use design, further increased the firm's international prominence and solidified the firm's reputation as a progressive global practice. KPF was chosen for subsequent projects throughout Europe, including Provinciehuis in The Hague (1998), Danube House in River City, Prague (2003), the expansion and renovation of the World Trade Center in Amsterdam (2004) and the Endesa Headquarters in Madrid (2003). =Work in Asia and internationally (1990s‚Äì2009)= KPF's introduction to the Asian market began with the Japan Railways Central Towers project in Nagoya (1999). Within 10 years, KPF had projects in Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. Completed KPF projects in Asia include Plaza 66 on Shanghai‚Äôs Nanjing Xi Lu (2001), Roppongi Hills in Tokyo (2003), the Rodin Pavilion in Seoul (2003), the Merrill Lynch Japan Head Office in Tokyo (2004) and the Shanghai World Financial Center (2008), which was named the ‚ÄúBest Tall Building Overall‚Äù by the Council on Tall Buildings and the Urban Habitat in 2008. KPF worked with renowned structural engineers, Leslie E. Robertson Associates, to maximize the tower‚Äôs floor plate and material efficiency by perfecting its tapered form. In addition to this work in Asia, KPF has completed projects in: the Middle East, including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority Headquarters (2007) and the Marina Towers (2008); South America including Ventura Corporate Towers in Rio de Janeiro (2008) and Infinity Tower in S√£o Paulo (2012); Australia, including Chifley Tower in Sydney (1992); and has also worked on several projects in Africa. = Expanded National and Global Presence (2010 ‚Äì Present) = Four decades after its founding, KPF has refined particular expertise in the area of office design, supertall structures, and large-scale, urban, mixed use developments. In November 2018, the firm announced the opening of new offices in San Francisco, Berlin, and Singapore to support current projects, new commissions, and imminent endeavors in those regions. The firm‚Äôs high-profile projects include One Vanderbilt, a new supertall office tower in Midtown Manhattan located next to Grand Central Terminal and providing direct access to the station; and the master plan for Hudson Yards, the largest private real estate development in U.S. history, which mixes residences with offices, hotels and retail, and street life. KPF also designed buildings 10 Hudson Yards, 20 Hudson Yards, 30 Hudson Yards, and 55 Hudson Yards, which together offer office, retail, and hospitality space within the development. Also in New York, KPF is leading the redevelopment of New York City Housing Authority‚Äôs (NYCHA) Red Hook Houses, which suffered severe flooding and wind damage during Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The largest public housing development in Brooklyn, Red Hook Houses accommodates over 6,000 people across 28 buildings. Outside of the United States, KPF has been contributing to the regeneration and conservation of the Covent Garden Estate in the roles of both master planner and architect for a collection of buildings. Also in London, the firm designed 52 Lime Street, known as The Scalpel, which joins a number of tall towers in the city‚Äôs financial area.  Initiatives  = KPFui = KPF Urban Interface, abbreviated KPFui, is an interdisciplinary urban data analytics research initiative within KPF. Founded in 2012 by designer and educator Luc Wilson, KPFui experiments with enriching KPF's signature design process with objective, measurable data sourced from within the complex urban contexts that the firm works. Their unique computational tools enable designers and developers to assess building performance metrics early in a project's conception, analyzing such parameters as daylight, views, and wind, among others. Research is heavily focused on experimenting with data visualization, displaying such metrics \\"to be accessible and understandable,\\" and consequently \\"fostering a dialogue that is thorough and inclusive\\" amongst architects, developers, and the public alike. KPFui implements its analytical studies across all scales, from KPF's design of the supertall tower to the expansive urban masterplan, located in cities around the globe. The KPFui team works out of the firm's New York office, at which KPF is headquartered. Since its initial founding, KPFui has applied its custom data-analytics tools to over 250 of the firm's projects, having become an integral part of the firm's design methodology.

The samphor (; also romanized as sampho) is a small, 2-headed barrel drum indigenous to Cambodia, approximately .35 meter wide by .5 meter long. It has two heads, with one drumhead being larger than the other and is played with both hands. Depending on the ability of the musician, the samphor can make as many as 8 different pitches. The player of the sampho leads the pinpeat (a classical ensemble of wind and percussion instruments), setting the tempo and beat. It is also played at freestyle boxing evens, accompanying the sralai. The samphor is analogous to the taphon used in Thailand. The samphor is made by hollowing out a single block of wood into a barrel shape. Both ends are covered with calfskin, tightened by strips of leather or rattan. One head of the drum is larger than the other to allow differing tones. Traditionally, the maker \\"tunes\\" each head by applying a circle of paste made of rice and ashes (from a palm); however a new resin paste is available today. The pitch to which the skin head is tuned becomes lower with a thicker layer of ash. The drummer makes use of four distinct strokes: an open and closed stroke for each head.

The tower was built between 1961 and 1964, and is not open to the public. Owner and operator of the site is Deutsche Funkturm (DFMG), a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. The Fernmeldeturm Berlin is tall, and its steel-reinforced concrete shaft extends to a height of . Between in elevation, the tower houses six floors for technical equipment. This currently consists of transmitters for DVB-T digital television, analog FM radio, and newer DAB and DMB digital radio. From 1964 to the early nineties, the tower was used to implement two over-the-horizon radio links to the rest of West Germany. The city of Berlin was geographically isolated, so unusual means were necessary to bridge the distance. One such link used bundled arrays of directional antennas mounted near the top to establish a near-line-of sight connection at 250 MHz and 400 MHz to the tower at Gartow. The other used tropospheric scatter at 2 GHz to establish a non-line-of-sight link to Torfhaus.Der deutsche Fernsehturm, Rudolf Pospischil, 2009, pages 40-47 To that end the tower was equipped with two parabolic dish antennas, each in diameter, which were mounted on the lower portion of the tower. They were removed in 1996. Because of these aerials, the Fernmeldeturm Berlin had to be designed to withstand triple the wind loading of the comparably sized TV tower in Stuttgart. The concrete shaft is thus in diameter at the bottom, with a wall thickness of . At the mark, the shaft is nigh in diameter. Directly adjacent to the Fernmeldeturm Berlin is a free standing steel framework tower. Formerly it supported two diameter parabolic aerials for an over-the-horizon radio link, also to Torfhaus. These have since been removed. It is now predominantly used for cellular network aerials. Since 2001, the Fernmeldeturm Berlin is also used for transmissions in the medium-wave range on 1485 kHz in DRM mode. Since the tower was not designed to accommodate this frequency range, a long wire aerial was installed for this purpose.

She was executed for war crimes. Life Born to a lower middle-class German family in F√∂rsterei Dusterlake, Brandenburg, Germany, Binz attended school until she was 15. She volunteered for kitchen work at Ravensbr√ºck in August 1939, and was given a position of Aufseherin (female overseer) the following month.Women and Nazis: Perpetrators of Genocide and Other Crimes During Hitler's Regime, 1933-1945, Wendy Adele-Marie Sarti, Academia Press, Palo Alto Ca, 2011. Camp work Binz served as an Aufseherin under Oberaufseherin Emma Zimmer, Johanna Langefeld, Maria Mandl, and Anna Klein. Though she worked under higher-ranking guards, Binz was known as \\"the true star of the camp\\", and the \\"chief guard was completely overshadowed by her deputy.\\" She worked in various parts of the camp, including the kitchen and laundry. Later, she is said to have supervised the bunker where women prisoners were tortured and killed. She began as deputy director of her penal block in September 1940, and became director of the cell block in the summer of 1942. Binz was unofficially promoted to Stellvertretende Oberaufseherin (Deputy Chief Wardress) in July 1943; the promotion was made official in February 1944. Her abuse was later described as \\"unyielding\\". She was known to \\"watch for the weakest or most fearful women, whom she would then shower with lashes or blows.\\" As a member of the command staff between 1943 and 1945, she directed training and assigned duties to over 100 female guards at one time. Binz reportedly trained some of the cruelest female guards in the system, including Ruth Closius. At Ravensbr√ºck, the young Binz is said to have beaten, slapped, kicked, shot, whipped, stomped and abused women continuously. Witnesses testified that when she appeared at the Appellplatz, \\"silence fell.\\" She reportedly carried a whip in hand, along with a leashed German Shepherd, and at a moment's notice would kick a woman to death or select her to be killed. She reportedly had a boyfriend in the camp, an SS officer, Edmund Br√§uning. The couple reportedly went on romantic walks around the camp to watch women being flogged, after which they would stroll away laughing. They lived together in a house outside the camp walls until late 1944, when Br√§uning was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp. Capture and execution Binz fled Ravensbr√ºck during the death march, was captured on 3 May 1945 by the British in Hamburg, and incarcerated in the Recklinghausen camp (formerly a Buchenwald subcamp). She was tried with SS personnel by a British court at the Ravensbr√ºck War Crimes Trials. She was convicted of perpetrating war crimes, sentenced to death, and subsequently hanged (by long-drop method) on the gallows at by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint on 2 May 1947.

He has served as the General Manager and Senior Vice President of the Yankees since 1998. During Cashman's tenure as general manager, the Yankees have won six American League pennants and four World Series championships. Cashman began working with the Yankees organization in 1986 as an intern while still in college. He was named assistant general manager in 1992, helping to run the team while owner George Steinbrenner was suspended from baseball. He succeeded Bob Watson as the team's general manager in 1998. Early life Cashman was born in Rockville Centre, New York, and raised in Washingtonville, New York. He was raised in an Irish Catholic family, as the middle of five children born to Nancy and John Cashman. He became a baseball fan at a young age, attending a summer camp hosted by Bucky Dent before starting high school. He grew up as a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers.http://articles.sun- sentinel.com/2003-10-21/sports/0310210154_1_john-cashman-brian-cashman-mary- pratt While visiting his grandmother in Florida, he served as a batboy for the Dodgers during spring training in 1982, with the help of former Dodger Ralph Branca, a family friend. The Cashman family moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where his father managed Castleton Farm, raising standardbreds for harness racing. Cashman described moving out of Washingtonville before starting high school as \\"the best thing to happen to [him], to get out of there.\\" Cashman attended Lexington Catholic High School before moving to the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, graduating in 1985. Cashman played baseball and junior varsity basketball at both schools, and added football in his senior year. Brian was classmates with Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and two years after Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh. The Catholic University of America offered Cashman the opportunity to play college baseball for the Catholic Cardinals, competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III, guaranteeing him playing time as a freshman. He was a four-year starter at second base and the team's leadoff hitter. He set a school record for most hits in a season, which has since been broken. He earned a bachelor's degree with a major in history in 1989. New York Yankees (1986‚Äìpresent) George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees, met John Cashman when he managed Pompano Park in Pompano Beach, Florida, and the two became friends. Through another family friend, John helped Brian obtain a position with the Yankees organization as an intern in 1986. He worked in the minor league scouting department in the day, and worked security at night. After Cashman graduated from Catholic, the Yankees offered him a position as a baseball operations assistant, which he accepted. Steinbrenner was banned from baseball in July 1990 for hiring a gambler to investigate Dave Winfield. Gene Michael, then the Yankees' General Manager, took over daily operations of the Yankees, and Cashman played a role in assisting him. He was promoted to assistant farm director that year, and to major league administrator in 1991. Michael named Cashman an Assistant General Manager in 1992. He remained in the role after Bob Watson succeeded Michael as general manager in 1995. The Yankees won the 1996 World Series. =General Manager (1998‚Äìpresent)= \\"Dynastic\\" years and success (1998‚Äì2005) upright In February 1998, Watson resigned from the Yankees, and Cashman was named Senior Vice-President and General Manager. He agreed to a one-year contract for $300,000, and became the second-youngest general manager in MLB history. The Yankees won 114 games during the 1998 season, and won the 1998 World Series. In 1999, Cashman traded fan favorite David Wells to the Toronto Blue Jays to acquire Roger Clemens. The next year, he acquired David Justice, who won the American League Championship Series (ALCS) Most Valuable Player Award for his play in the 2000 ALCS. The Yankees won the 2000 World Series, making Cashman the first General Manager to win World Series titles in his first three years. In 2004, Cashman arranged the trade of Alfonso Soriano for Alex Rodriguez. Despite the team's success, Cashman considered leaving the Yankees in 2005 due to conflicts with Steinbrenner and organizational disputes between team officials in New York City and Tampa, Florida. The Washington Nationals were rumored to be interested in hiring Cashman, which would have brought him back to the city where he attended school. Instead, Cashman agreed to a new contract with the Yankees following the conclusion of the 2005 season which gave him more authority in personnel decisions and paid him an average of $1.3 million more over the following three years. Another championship (2006‚Äì2009) With the increased authority, Cashman created a department of professional scouting, and tabbed Billy Eppler as its director. Later, Eppler would move on to become the General Manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. On September 30, 2008, Cashman signed a three-year contract to stay with the Yankees through the 2011 season. Following the 2008 season, when the Yankees failed to make the playoffs, Cashman signed CC Sabathia, A. J. Burnett, and Mark Teixeira to long-term free agent contracts and traded for Nick Swisher. These four players played a significant role in the 2009 Yankees season, culminating with a victory in the 2009 World Series. Post-Championship years and struggles (2010‚Äì2016) The Yankees went on to make the playoffs again following the 2010 season, but lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 American League Championship Series. Following the 2010 season, Cashman held a hard line with Derek Jeter during contract negotiations, reportedly telling Jeter that he would prefer to have Troy Tulowitzki as the Yankees' starting shortstop, though a deal was eventually made for three years and $45 million. Yankees ownership agreed to sign Rafael Soriano in January 2011 without Cashman's approval. Cashman stated at Soriano's introductory press conference that he disagreed with the deal. The Yankees re-signed Cashman to a three-year contract in November 2011. During 2013, Alex Rodriguez composed a tweet, saying that he had been cleared to play by his doctors after his hip surgery. Cashman was not pleased about the tweet, claiming that the doctors did not give such authority to clear Rodriguez to play after seeking a second opinion with them, causing his faith and relationship with Rodriguez to be alienated. Cashman also wanted to trade Robinson Can√≥ during the 2013 season, reasoning that they would be unable to re-sign him in the next offseason. Ownership prevented Cashman from exploring a trade. After the 2013 season, the Yankees signed Masahiro Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann, and Carlos Beltr√°n to contracts that totaled $438 million. However, the Yankees missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. On October 10, 2014, the Yankees signed Cashman to another three-year deal through the 2017 season. That offseason, Cashman prioritized restructuring the Yankees roster with younger players. He replaced the retired Jeter with Didi Gregorius and also acquired Nathan Eovaldi, both of whom improved during the season. In the 2016 season, he traded Carlos Beltr√°n to the Texas Rangers, Andrew Miller to the Cleveland Indians, and Aroldis Chapman to the eventual World Series Champion Chicago Cubs to bolster the Yankees farm system. \\"Baby Bombers\\" Era (2017‚Äìpresent) In 2017, the Yankees made the postseason with rookie outfielder Aaron Judge and second-year catcher Gary Sanchez. The Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins in the 2017 American League Wild Card Game, and then went on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the 2017 American League Division Series. Making their first appearance in the American League Championship Series since 2012, the Yankees lost to the Houston Astros in seven games, far outpacing the expectations of many analysts. Following the season, Cashman recommended to the owner Hal Steinbrenner that a managerial change was needed. Baseball America named Cashman their Executive of the Year after the season.https://www.baseballamerica.com/majors/2017-mlb-executive-of- the-year-yankees-gm-brian-cashman/ On December 9, Cashman traded second baseman Starlin Castro and two prospects for Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton.http://www.nj.com/yankees/index.ssf/2017/12/yankees_trade_for_giancarlo_stanton_what_we_know_s.html On December 11, 2017, Cashman signed a 5-year, $25 million contract with the Yankees to keep him as General Manager through 2022.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2017/12/08/yankees-gm-brian- cashman-five-year-extension/934728001/ If Cashman completes his new deal, he will become the longest-tenured General Manager in Yankees history. The 2018 season saw Cashman and the Yankees win 100 games. Despite a lopsided victory in the AL Wildcard game over the A's, New York would fall to their rivals: Boston Red Sox in the Division Series. On April 7, 2019, Cashman won his 2,000th game as the Yankees general manager. In the 2019 season, the Yankees won 103 games despite having over 30 players on the injured list during the season, with the players accounting over $81 million dollars unable to play at one point of time.https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrymbloom/2019/04/23/the-new- york-yankees-are-competing-with-81-9-million-worth-of-players-on-the-injured- list/#7fab78c76ae3https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/a-look-at-the-yankees- injury-timetables Honors Cashman was named to Crain's New York Business 40 under 40 list for 1999. The Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America selected Cashman as their MLB Executive of the Year for 2009. In 2010, Cashman was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. Cashman was selected as Baseball Executive of the Year in 2017. Cashman was also involved in the developing of the video game MLB Front Office Manager. Personal life Cashman lives in Darien, Connecticut. He and his wife, Mary, had two children, Grace and Theodore. Mary filed for divorce in February 2012; they had been reportedly separated for a year. The day prior, prosecutors charged a woman with stalking Cashman in an attempt to extort money regarding an extramarital affair. Cashman is a Kentucky Wildcats and New Jersey Devils fan. Cashman has referred to himself as an \\"adrenaline junkie\\". In December 2010, Cashman rappelled from a building in Stamford, Connecticut, as part of an annual Stamford Christmas celebration. He jumped from an airplane with members of the United States Army Parachute Team to raise awareness for the Wounded Warrior Project, and broke his right fibula and dislocated his right ankle in the process. In November 2014, Cashman slept on a New York City sidewalk to raise awareness on behalf of homeless youth.

It is native to the grasslands of southern and eastern Africa, ranging from South Africa to Sudan. One species is endemic to Madagascar.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Description They can be evergreen or deciduous perennials that grow from basal underground corms. The alternate leaves are cauline and ensiform (sword shaped). The blades are parallel-veined. The margin is entire. The corms form in vertical chains with the youngest at the top and oldest and largest buried most deeply in the soil. The roots of the lowermost corm in a chain are contractile roots and drag the corm deeper into the ground where conditions allow. The chains of corms are fragile and easily separated, a quality that has enabled some species to become invasive and difficult to control in the garden. They have colourful inflorescences of 4 to 20 vivid red and orange subopposite flowers on a divaricately (horizontally) branched stem. The terminal inflorescence can have the form of a cyme or a raceme. These flower from early summer well into fall. The flowers are sessile on a flexuose arched spike. The fertile flowers are hermaphroditic. All stamens have an equal length. The style branches are apically forked. They are pollinated by insects, birds (hummingbirds) or by the wind. The dehiscent capsules are shorter than they are wide. The alternative name montbretia is still widely used. The genus name is derived from the Greek words krokos, meaning \\"saffron\\", and osme, meaning \\"odor\\" ‚Äì from the dried leaves emitting a strong smell like that of saffron (a spice derived from Crocus ‚Äì another genus belonging to the Iridaceae) ‚Äì when immersed in hot water.

L. Mencken's 1918 book on women and the relationship between the sexes. Some laud the book as progressive while others brand it as reactionary. While Mencken did not champion women's rights, he described women as wiser in many novel and observable ways, while demeaning average men. According to Mencken's biographer, Fred Hobson: :\\"Depending on the position of the reader, he was either a great defender of women's rights or, as a critic labelled him in 1916, 'the greatest misogynist since Schopenhauer', 'the country's high-priest of woman-haters.'\\" History The original title for Defense was A Book for Men Only, but other working titles included The Eternal Feminine as well as The Infernal Feminine. The book was originally published by Philip Goodman in 1918, but Mencken released a new edition in 1922 in an attempt to bring the book to a wider audience. This second edition, published by Alfred Knopf, was both much longer and milder. Content =General= In general, biographers describe Defense as \\"ironic\\": it was not so much a defense of women as a critique of the relationship between the sexes. Topics covered by the book included \\"Woman's Equipment,\\" \\"Compulsory Marriage,\\" \\"The Emancipated Housewife,\\" and \\"Women as Martyrs.\\" Women were gaining rights, according to Mencken‚Äîthe ability to partake in adultery without lasting public disgrace, the ability to divorce men, and even some escape from the notion of virginity as sacred, which remained as \\"one of the hollow conventions of Christianity.\\" Women nonetheless remained restrained by social conventions in many capacities. =Suffrage= Mencken's love of women was driven in part by the sympathy he had for female literary characters (especially those brought to life by his friend Theodore Dreiser), as well as his almost fanatical love of his mother. Mencken supported women's rights, even if he had no affection for the suffragist. Although he originally intended to be ironic when he proclaimed that women were the superior gender, many of the qualities he assigned to them were qualities he deeply admired ‚Äì realism and skepticism among them, but also manipulative skill and a detached view of humankind. =\\"Demeaning\\"= Mencken praised women, though he believed they should remain in the background of industry and politics. In personal letters especially, Mencken would write that women should appreciate men and do their best to support them. Although Mencken did not intend to demean women, his description of his \\"ideal scene\\" with a woman in the 1922 edition was not conventionally progressive: Mencken often espoused views of politics, religion, and metaphysics that stressed their grotesqueness and absurdity; in this context, escape from the supposed fraud of such somber subjects was welcome to him. Critical reviews The book was reviewed very well: according to Carl Bode, there were four times as many favorable reviews as unfavorable. The first edition of the book sold fewer than 900 copies, a disappointing showing. The second edition sold much better, during the more progressive Roaring Twenties.

A goalkeeper, he played for Leeds United and Birmingham City and also won 37 caps for Wales. Sprake became known during his career as a goalkeeper who was brilliant, but occasionally prone to some unlucky, appalling mistakes. He was known as an overall, good goalkeeper. He was especially known for his ability to come out to catch crossed balls floating into the box and his shot stopping. At Leeds, Sprake played 504 times, keeping more than 200 clean sheets. He spent more than a decade as the number 1 keeper at Leeds during a period when they were a dominant side in the English domestic game. Club career Sprake represented Swansea Schoolboys and was noticed by Leeds United soon after he left school and was playing for a local works team. Sprake joined Leeds as an apprentice, and made a last-minute debut in 1962 when the regular goalkeeper went down with a stomach complaint on the day of a game at Southampton. Over the next two seasons Sprake became a regular as Leeds won the Second Division in 1964, and then challenged for the Football League championship title and FA Cup double the following year. Sprake only missed one game in both competitions that season, but Leeds ended with nothing, missing out on the League title on goal average to Manchester United and losing the FA Cup final to Liverpool. At Leeds, he was also known to be sick before each match but managed to play regularly and keep the starting goalkeeper position. The first of Sprake's two notorious errors came in 1967 when Leeds played Liverpool in a League game at Anfield. Sprake was holding the ball and was set to throw it to the Leeds left back Terry Cooper, only to curtail his throw when he spotted Liverpool winger Ian Callaghan running towards the area he planned to throw the ball. Unfortunately for Sprake, the ball slipped out of his hands behind him and ended up in the net. At half-time, the Liverpool tannoy-announcer played \\"Careless Hands\\", a record by Des O'Connor, apparently in reference to Sprake's mistake, and during the second half Liverpool supporters on the Kop sang the song repeatedly to Sprake. During his time at Leeds, fans of rival clubs gave Sprake the nickname \\"Careless Hands\\" as a result. In the same season Sprake kept a clean sheet as Leeds beat Arsenal in the League Cup final, and he performed heroics behind an overworked defence as Leeds won the Fairs Cup, the club's first European honour. In 1969, Sprake was again a regular as Leeds won the League championship. In 1970, Sprake and Leeds chased a treble of the League, the FA Cup and the European Cup, but ended up with nothing. The League title went to Everton who won by nine points, and Leeds went out of the European Cup in the semi-finals to Celtic. The FA Cup Final provided the stage for the second of Sprake's most memorable errors. In the 1970 FA Cup Final, Leeds were playing Chelsea and took an early lead through Jack Charlton. Chelsea chased an equaliser, but when attacking midfield player Peter Houseman hit a left foot shot shortly before the break, it seemed tame and directionless enough for Sprake to save it safely. Sprake dived full length to save it but it squirmed through his grasp and rolled into the net. At the time, the Wembley surface was in poor condition, with the stadium having hosted the Horse of the Year Show days earlier and having much of the grass turned into hard turf lumps as a result, as well as the presence of a vast covering of sand. In the second half, Mick Jones put Leeds ahead with just six minutes to go, but Chelsea again equalized. Sprake suffered a knee injury and was replaced by David Harvey in the replay, which Chelsea won 2‚Äì1. Sprake was still the first-choice keeper for Leeds in the following two seasons, but was replaced by Harvey at the tail of both, including the 1972 FA Cup Final. Sprake watched from the sidelines as Leeds defeated Arsenal 1‚Äì0 in 1972 with a goal from Allan Clarke and a superb performance by Harvey at the other end. In the same year, due to his need of first-team football, Sprake publicly criticised Revie for his treatment of him and so his relationship with his manager, teammates, and the Leeds supporters soured. He only played once in the 1972‚Äì73 season, missed two more Cup finals, and eventually left for Birmingham City for ¬£100,000 (breaking the world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper in the process) to play first-team football and regain his place in the Welsh team. International career Sprake was the youngest-ever goalkeeper to appear for Wales when he made his international debut as an 18-year-old against Scotland on 20 November 1963. Sprake won 37 caps for Wales between 1963 and 1974.. After football A back injury brought Sprake's career to an end at the age of 30, the injury resulting from a near fatal blood clot in his back which forced him to undergo spinal fusion surgery. His severe back problems have been largely blamed on regular injections of cortisone he was given during his early career at Leeds. After retiring, Sprake underwent seven operations on his back. He subsequently kept his profile low, returning to his native Wales. He was paid ¬£7,500 by the Daily Mirror to make allegations against former Leeds manager Don Revie and club captain regarding match-fixing, but refused to repeat the allegations under oath in court. Wolverhampton Wanderers' Derek Dougan asserted that he heard no mention of the bribes. Following his retirement, Sprake worked as a salesman for a short period before becoming a borough council training officer in Solihull, a job which he remained in for over 14 years. His biography, Careless Hands: The Forgotten Truth of Gary Sprake by Tim Johnson and Stuart Sprake (his nephew), was published in 2006. In November 2009 Sprake was given an award by the Football Association of Wales for his contribution to Welsh football during the 1960s and 1970s. Sprake died at the age of 71 on 18 October 2016.

Summary British and Irish bands that did well in the charts included Stereophonics, the Chemical Brothers, and Westlife; the latter topped the charts for a record 10th time, matching Madonna. They also were the act to obtain 10 chart toppers the most quickly, with only 35 months between this and their first. The fastest-selling debut single in UK chart history was released by the Winner of the TV talent show, Pop Idol; Will Young had been voted as the winner by over 4 million people in the final, after winning six out of the nine weeks, with Gareth Gates, the eventual runner-up, winning three times. \\"Anything is Possible/Evergreen\\", topped the charts for 3 weeks and sold over 1.1 million copies in its first week of sale; altogether it sold over 1.7 million copies, becoming the 11th biggest-selling single in the UK and also the second fastest-selling single in the UK, with only Elton John's \\"Candle in the Wind\\" ahead of it. Young reached the top again with his second single \\"Light My Fire\\". Runner-up Gareth Gates scored a No. 1 with his debut single, \\"Unchained Melody\\", spending one week more at the top than Will Young, thought the single itself sold less than Will Young's; nonetheless it became the 77th million- selling single in the UK and the last one until 2004. Overall, it is the 37th biggest selling single in the UK. Gates also had a second No.1 single, \\"Anyone Of Us (Stupid Mistake)\\", which topped the charts for 3 weeks, bettering Will Young by one week once again. Darius Danesh, third in Pop Idol, also made No 1 with \\"Colourblind\\". After both having two chart toppers, Young and Gates joined forces and revived an old Beatles classic, \\"The Long and Winding Road\\". UK girl group Sugababes (who were now under their second line-up of original members Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena and former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, who replaced Siobh√°n Donaghy after her departure the previous year) scored their first UK number one with \\"Freak like Me\\". Ronan Keating also returned to the top of the singles chart with a cover of \\"If Tomorrow Never Comes\\". Liberty X, consisting of the five losers who just failed to make Hear'Say in the talent show Popstars, reached No. 1 with Just a Little, eventually becoming more successful than Hear'Say, who disbanded in October. S Club Juniors, an 8-piece pre-teen spin off from S Club 7 (who saw the departure of band member Paul Cattermole earlier that year) reached No 2 with their debut single One Step Closer. The Sugababes hit the top for a second time with their sixth single, \\"Round Round\\". Like their first No. 1 single, it only spent a week at the summit. The song was taken from the soundtrack to the hit film, \\"The Guru\\". Specialising in Pop/R'N'B with garage influences, all- male act, Blazin' Squad entered at the top of the charts with their massively hyped debut single, \\"Crossroads\\". Their success slowly decline throughout their career. Coldplay released their second album, a follow-up to Parachutes; A Rush of Blood to the Head included several hit singles and they became one of the few early 2000s era British acts to achieve fame and popularity in the US. Having topped the singles charts three times, Atomic Kitten also scored a No. 1 album with their 3rd release, Feels So Good. The album spawned two top 3 hits as well as their 3rd chart topper. Twelve months after he hit the top with his debut single, Daniel Bedingfield returned to the top with a slow ballad, \\"If You're Not The One\\". It became his 2nd UK No. 1, and his debut album, Gotta Get Thru This, produced five Top 10 singles and six Top 40 hits. Boy band Blue reached the top of the UK charts for the third time, collaborating with Elton John to revive an old hit of his, \\"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\\". A notable charity single that reached the top 20 was \\"Nothing Sacred ‚Äì A Song for Kirsty\\" by Russell Watson. The campaign raised money for the Francis House Children's Hospital, and was inspired by Kirsty Howard, an eight-year old with a rare heart condition. The song peaked at number 17 and sales contributed to the ¬£5million target for the Kirsty Appeal achieved in 2006. Popstars: The Rivals became the new phenomenon in the world of talent shows, producing two new acts, boy band One True Voice and girl group Girls Aloud. They both released their singles in Christmas week and the girls beat the boys to the top spot, claiming the Christmas number one with \\"Sound of the Underground\\". Robbie Williams took the Christmas number one album spot yet again with his fifth No. 1 album, Escapology.

It is located approximately south of Leesburg on U.S. Route 15, in an unincorporated area of Loudoun County, Virginia. Its entrance is north of Gilberts Corner, the intersection of 15 with U.S. Route 50. It is a National Historic Landmark, but privately owned and not open to the public. History Rear view, 1915 The main mansion of the property was constructed in 1822 for Monroe, who subsequently split time between this estate and another home at Monroe Hill on the grounds of the University of Virginia after his term as President. Oak Hill was Monroe's only residence for three years, from 1827 to 1830, and it was one of his residences during 22 years. The mansion was built in 1820, during Monroe's presidency. Before that, Monroe's residence at the estate was the clapboard building known in recent years as the Monroe Cottage. The architecture is distinctive for \\"its unusual pentastyle portico\\". It is suggested that Thomas Jefferson, his close friend, may well have drawn plans for Oak Hill; the construction was supervised by James Hoban, designer and builder of the White House. Aside from the main house, other structures remaining from Monroe's time include the cottage, a smokehouse, springhouse, blacksmith's shop, a square barn, the stone Stallion Barn, and possibly the Brick House. The estate is a designated U.S. National Historic Landmark. Purchase Monroe and his uncle Joseph Jones jointly purchased 4,400 acres (18 km¬≤) of land in Loudoun County in 1794. When Jones died without direct heirs in 1805, Monroe gained sole possession of the property. However, Monroe continued to live primarily at Highland, his residence in Albemarle County-- until 1826, when he was forced to sell that property to pay debts he had incurred while serving as President. Attempted sale Monroe had put Oak Hill on the market in 1809, and placed an advertisement in The Washingtonian on December 23 of that year: :LOUDOUN LAND :FOR SALE :For sale on Thursday, the 21st of December next on the premises, the tract of LAND on which the late Judge Jones resided in Loudoun County with about 25 slaves, and the stock of Horses, Cattle, and Hogs, on the estate. The tract contains nearly 2000 acres [8 km¬≤], and possesses many advantages which entitle it to the attention of those who may wish to reside, in that highly improved part of our country. Two merchant mills are in the neighbourhood, one on the adjoining estate, and the other within two miles [3 km]. It is 10 miles [16 km] from Leesburg, 35 [56 km] from Alexandria and 40 [64 km] from Georgetown. The new, Turn-pike from Alexandria crosses a corner of the land, and terminates at the nearest merchant mill. The whole tract is remarkably well watered, Little river passing through the middle of it, and many small streams on each side emptying into that river. About 50 or 60 acres [200,000 or 240,000 m¬≤] are already well set with timothy, and at least 300 acres (1.2 km¬≤) are capable of being made excellent meadow. It will be divided into tracts of different dimensions to suit the convenience of purchasers. A credit of one, two and three years will be allowed. Bonds with approved security, and a trust on the land will be required. The negroes are supposed to be very valuable, some of them being good house servants, and the others, principally, young men and women. For them the same terms of credit will be allowed, and that of a year for every other article. :N.B. The above lands, being yet unsold, notice is given that they will be disposed of, by private sale, upon terms which will be made known on application to Israel Lacy Esq. of Goshen, Col. Armstead T. Mason, near Leesburg, Maj. Charles Fenton Mercer of Leesburg, or to the subscriber, near Milton in Albemarle county. :JAMES MONROE. :December, 23d 1809. He also attempted to sell the land in 1825, but failed to receive an acceptable bid both times. Retirement In 1822, Monroe began construction on the main house, a two-story brick mansion in the Federal style. He hired James Hoban, the designer of the White House, to serve as architect. Monroe's longtime friend and political mentor Thomas Jefferson offered many design suggestions. Monroe and his wife, Elizabeth Kortright Monroe, retired to Oak Hill after he finished his second term as President in 1825. In August 1825, the Marquis de Lafayette and President John Quincy Adams were guests of the Monroes there. Elizabeth Monroe died at Oak Hill on September 23, 1830. After her death, Monroe moved to New York City to live with his youngest daughter and remained there until his own death on July 4, 1831. After Monroe's death, the property passed out of the Monroe family. John W. Fairfax, later a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate States Army, bought Oak Hill in 1852. His wife remained there while Fairfax was away fighting in the American Civil War; it was visited by General George G. Meade of the Union Army on the invitation of Mrs. Fairfax about a week prior to the Battle of Gettysburg. The property passed out of the hands of John Fairfax after the war, but was later repurchased by his eldest son, Henry, a civil engineer and state senator. The estate remained in the Fairfax family until after Henry Fairfax's death in 1916. The mansion was enlarged by the addition of two wings in 1922 while owned by Frank C. Littleton and his wife, but the central facade looks much as it did during Monroe's lifetime. The property remains in private hands today and is not open to the public. It became the residence of Tom and Gayle DeLashmutt and their family following the death of the previous owner, Eugene Reed Prendergast, Mr. DeLashmutt's mother, in 1993. Two U.S. Navy ships have been named USS Oak Hill after the estate.

It is composed of 411 amino acids, weighing about 88.5kDa. It functions as an anticoagulant, inhibiting coagulation factors IX (IXa) and X (Xa), thus keeping the blood of the bitten victim from clotting while the bat is drinking. Draculin is a reversible, slow tight binding, noncompetitive inhibitor of FXa. It does not act on thrombin, trypsin or chymotrypsin and does not express fibrinolytic activity. The protein increases the lag phase as well as the height of the peak of thrombin generation when in plasma, leading to prolonged bleeding. Daily salivation of vampire bats yields a saliva that progressively decreases in anticoagulant activity. However, there is no significant change in overall protein content during this time. After a 4-day period of rest, anticoagulant activity of the saliva is restored. In addition, purified native draculin, obtained from high- and low- activity saliva, shows significant differences in composition of the carbohydrate moiety, and glycosylation pattern. Furthermore, controlled chemical deglycosylation of native draculin progressively leads to complete loss of the biological activity, despite the conditions leaving the polypeptide backbone intact. Medicine As vampire bats bite their victims, their saliva releases an enzyme called desmoteplase, or DSPA, into the bloodstream, which causes blood to flow more readily. Scientists believe that the same enzyme that gives bats more blood for their bite may be used as medicine for stroke victims by breaking down blood clots . Draculin is currently being explored in medicine. The anticoagulant may be useful as a treatment for strokes and heart attacks. It may also be used as a blood thinner for the prevention of heart attacks. The protein has shown promise when treating ischemic strokes, which account for the majority of strokes. It is effective for up to 9 hours. However, since the activity depends heavily on the proper glycosylation of the polypeptide backbone, more research is needed before draculin can become a practical, widely available drug.

From Emil Hildebrand, Sveriges historia intill tjugonde seklet (1910). Gunnar Wennerberg (2 October 1817, in Lidk√∂ping ‚Äì 24 August 1901, in L√§ck√∂) was a Swedish poet, composer and politician. Biography Wennerberg was the son of the vicar of the town of Lidk√∂ping in V√§sterg√∂tland, went to gymnasium in the cathedral town of Skara, and matriculated as a student at Uppsala University in 1837, where he studied natural sciences, Classical philology, Philosophy and Aesthetics. He received his filosofie magister degree in 1845 and became a docent of Aesthetics in 1846. Carl Johan Eldh in Minnehaha Park Wennerberg was remarkable in several ways, handsome in face and tall in figure, with a finely trained singing voice, and brilliant in wit and conversation. From the outset of his career he was accepted in the inner circle of men of light and leading for which the university was at that time famous. In 1843 he became a member of the musical club who called themselves The Juvenals, and for their meetings were written the trios and duets, music and words, which Wennerberg began to publish in 1846. In the following year appeared the earliest numbers of Gluntarne (or \\"The Boys\\"), thirty duets for baritone and bass, which continued to be issued from 1847 to 1850. The success of these remarkable productions, masterpieces in two arts, was overwhelming: they presented an epitome of all that was most unusual and most attractive in the curious university life of Sweden. Plaque on Wennerberg's statue In the second volume of his collected works Wennerberg gave, long afterwards, a very interesting account of the inception and history of these celebrated duets. His great personal popularity, as the representative Swedish student, did not prevent him, however, from pursuing his studies, and he became an authority on Spinoza. In 1850 he first travelled through Sweden, singing and reciting in public, and his tour was a long popular triumph. In 1860 he published his collected trios, as De tre (\\"The Three\\"). In 1865, at the particular wish of the king, Charles XV, Wennerberg entered official life in the department of elementary education. Wennerberg succeeded Christian Eric Fahlcrantz in 1866 as one of the eighteen of the Swedish Academy, and in 1870 became Minister for education (ecklesiastikminister) in the government of Axel Gustaf Adlercreutz, upon the fall of which in 1875 he retired for a time into private life. He was, however, made governor (landsh√∂vding) of Kronoberg County, and shortly afterward was elected to represent it in the Riksdag. His active parliamentary life continued until he was nearly eighty years of age. In 1881 and 1885 he issued his collected works, mainly in verse. He was yet again appointed Minister of Education, for a second and final time in 1888, and served in office to 1891. After his resignation as a cabinet minister, he was then elected to the upper house of the Riksdag in 1893. Wennerberg preserved his superb appearance in advanced old age, and he died, after a very short illness, on 24 August 1901, at L√§ck√∂ Castle, where he was visiting his brother-in-law, Count Axel Rudensch√∂ld. His wife, the Countess Hedvig Cronstedt, whom he married in 1852, died in 1900. Wennerberg was a most remarkable type of the lyrical, ardent Swedish aristocrat, full of the joy of life and the beauty of it. In the long roll of his eighty-four years there was scarcely a crumpled rose-leaf. His poems, to which their musical accompaniment is almost essential, have not ceased, in half a century, to be universally pleasing to Swedish ears; outside Sweden it would be difficult to make their peculiarly local charm intelligible. Relatives Wennerberg's niece Sara Wennerberg-Reuter (1875-1959) was also a well-known musician; she was an organist and composer. His younger brother, Gunnar Brynolf Wennerberg was an artist.

He specialised in modern art works and contemporary sculpture. Etrog's works explore his first-hand experience of the Second World War; the renewal of sculptural traditions in modern art, such as the use of bronze as a medium; and the opposition between the mechanical and the organic. One of Canada's leading artists in the 1960s, Etrog contributed to the country's growing interest in sculpture.  Life  Born in Ia≈üi, Romania, in 1933, Etrog's formal art training began in 1945. In 1950, his family immigrated to Israel, where beginning in 1953 he studied at the Institute of Painting and Sculpture in Tel Aviv. His first solo exhibition in Tel Aviv in 1958 earned him a scholarship at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York City. In 1959, a meeting with Toronto art collector Samuel Zacks led to Etrog's first Canadian solo exhibition, at Gallery Moos in Toronto. Leaving New York for Toronto in 1963, Etrog became a Canadian citizen. After moving to Florence in 1965, he began casting his sculptures at the Michelucci Foundry, in Pistoia, and would continue to do so for the rest of his career. During this time, Etrog frequently visited his family in Israel. On one of his trips he met his future wife, Lika Behar, a fashion designer, who moved to Florence to live with him. However, a car accident that left Etrog badly injured led him and Behar to leave Florence in 1967 and move to Toronto, where they married.  Career  Since the late 1950s, Etrog's work has been exhibited extensively in solo and group exhibitions across Canada and internationally. Etrog's work is represented in major capitals and cities all over the world. He received several important commissions, including those for Expo 67, Montreal; SunLife Centre, Toronto; Windsor Sculpture Garden, Windsor, Ontario; Los Angeles County Museum; and Olympic Park in Seoul, South Korea. His commission for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, entitled Powersoul, is his largest work. In 1966, works by Etrog, along with those of Alex Colville and Yves Gaucher, represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. In 1968 Etrog was commissioned to design the Canadian Film Award that was originally named the \\"Etrog\\" and later renamed the \\"Genie\\". Etrog is also known for his writings and published plays, poetry and non-fiction. Of his many collaborations, the most acclaimed are his book illustrations for Eug√®ne Ionesco and Samuel Beckett in the late 1960s. Etrog and Marshall McLuhan collaborated on the publication Spiral, drawn from Etrog's film of the same title which was broadcast on CBC television in 1975. Numerous reviews, articles, monographs and catalogue texts have been written about Etrog, including Pierre Restany‚Äôs comprehensive textbook published by Prestel 2001. A major exhibition of Etrog's paintings and drawings of the 1960s was exhibited in March 2008 at Buschlen Mowatt Gallery, Vancouver. The Art Gallery of Ontario presented a major retrospective of Etrog's work in 2013, which coincided with his eightieth birthday.  Death and legacy  Sorel Etrog died on February 26, 2014, aged 80. Since his death, Sorel Etrog's legacy and collection are officially managed by The Estate of Sorel Etrog.

Life and work MacCullagh was born in Landahaussy, near Plumbridge, County Tyrone, Ireland, but the family moved to Curly Hill, Strabane when James was about 10. He was a fellow of Trinity College Dublin and a contemporary there of William Rowan Hamilton. In 1835 he was appointed Erasmus Smith's Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin and in 1843 became Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy.Erasmus Smith's professors of Mathematics Mathematics at TCD 1592‚Äì1992 Although he worked mostly on optics, he is also remembered for his work on geometry; his most significant work in optics was published in the mid-to-late 1830s; his most significant work on geometry On surfaces of the second order was published in 1843. He was awarded the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy in 1838. In Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, Charles Babbage wrote that MacCullagh was \\"an excellent friend of mine\\" and discussed the benefits and drawbacks of the analytical engine with him. MacCullagh's most important paper on optics, entitled \\"An essay towards a dynamical theory of crystalline reflection and refraction\\" was presented to the Royal Irish Academy in December 1839. The paper begins by defining what was then a new concept, the curl of a vector field. (The term 'curl' was first used by James Clerk Maxwell in 1870.) MacCullagh first showed that the curl is a covariant vector in the sense that its components are transformed in the appropriate manner under coordinate rotation. Taking his cue from George Green, he set out to develop a potential function for a dynamical theory for the transmission of light. MacCullagh found that a conventional potential function proportional to the squared norm of the displacement field was incompatible with known properties of light waves. In order to support only transverse waves, he found that the potential function must be proportional to the squared norm of the curl of the displacement field. It was accepted that his radical choice ruled out any hope for a mechanical model for the ethereal medium. Nevertheless, the field equations stemming from this purely gyrostatic medium were shown to be in accord with all known laws, including those of Snell and Augustin-Jean Fresnel. At several points, MacCullagh addresses the physical nature of an ethereal medium having such properties. Not surprisingly, he argues against a mechanical interpretation of the luminiferous aether because he readily admits that no known physical medium could have such a potential function resisting only rotation of its elements. \\"Concerning the peculiar constitution of the ether, we know nothing and shall suppose nothing, except what is involved in the foregoing assumptions [rectilinear vibrations in a medium of constant density]... Having arrived at the value of [the potential function], we may now take it for the starting point of our theory, and dismiss the assumptions by which we were conducted to it.\\" Despite the success of the theory, physicists and mathematicians were not receptive to the idea of reducing physics to a set of abstract field equations divorced from a mechanical model. The notion of the ether as a compressible fluid or similar physical entity was too deeply ingrained in nineteenth century physical thinking, even for decades after the publication of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory in 1864. MacCullagh's ideas were largely abandoned and forgotten until 1880, when George Francis FitzGerald re-discovered and re-interpreted his findings in the light of Maxwell's work. William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin succeeded in developing a physically realizable model of MacCullagh's rotationally elastic but translationally insensitive ether, consisting of gyrostats mounted on a framework of telescoping rods, described in his paper \\"On a Gyrostatic Adynamic Constitution for Ether\\" (1890). MacCullagh died in 1847 in Dublin at his own hand, perhaps depressed by what he saw as the decline of his mathematical powers. In May 2009, an Ulster History Circle plaque was unveiled at his family tomb at St Patrick's Church in Upper Badoney. The plaque was part of events organised by the Glenelly Historical Society to mark his life.

It is lower-set, with shorter legs, and is more muscular with heavier bone density than the related American Rat Terrier. Much diversity exists in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed, and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. The Rat Terrier's background is said to stem from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working-class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting, and utility dog, little to no planned breeding was used other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. The Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit Dog, and Wry-legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.Moore, Daniel History of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier These early ratting terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle crossbred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell. and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers, they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners at all times.

One such early cross was with the Beagle, and this cross possibly reinforced the bench leg, since the Bench-legged Beagle was a common hunting companion.Hunter Trader Trapper 1922 Vol 44 page 79 Separating the long-legged phenotype from the short-legged phenotype in most cases did not occur, litters born from parents of either or both phenotypes commonly displayed a variety of leg and body length, yet all were still considered and labeled merely as Rat Terriers. In the middle 1990s, efforts to segregate the types began in earnest, but mixing of the two types in some cases still exists today. Theodore Roosevelt's family, with terrier When the types were separated by the Rat Terrier Club of America, the short-legged variety was named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, although he never owned Rat Terriers nor was he instrumental in developing the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier. The dog most attributed to being one of the foundations for the Rat Terriers was a black- and-tan, mixed-breed, feist-type dog owned by the Roosevelts. In one of his letters to his children, President Roosevelt writes, \\"There is a very cunning little dog named Skip, belonging to John Goff's pack, who has completely adopted me. I think I shall take him home to Archie. He likes to ride on Dr. Lambert's horse, or mine, and though he is not as big as Jack, takes eager part in the fight with every bear and bobcat.\\"Bishop, Joseph Bucklin, ed. Theodore Roosevelt's Letters to His Children. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1919. Letters from 1898-1911 Often confused with Skip the black and tan feist, the Roosevelts also had a dog named Scamp. Scamp is the only dog mentioned in Roosevelt's letters as ever hunting rats while in the White House, \\"Scamp is really an extraordinary ratter and kills a great many rats in the White House, in the cellars and on the lower floor and among the machinery. He is really a very nice little dog.\\" Unfortunately, no pictures of Scamp nor descriptions other than one which describes him as a Fox Terrier have been found.Sports Illustrated November 02, 1981 E.M Swift, \\"The Mutt With A Touch Of Class\\" Another terrier which often is confused with the Rat Terrier was Roosevelt's dog named Jack. In Mr. Roosevelt's letter dated July 27, 1902, to Mrs. Roswell Field, he writes, \\"It is a real pleasure to send you a photograph of my boy Kermit, with Jack, the Manchester Terrier, who is absolutely a member of the family.\\" Jack was a Manchester Terrier, not a Rat Terrier. The first standard for the breed was developed by the now-defunct Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Club of America in 1996. Currently, several registration organizations are active, all of which have their own standards, but the most commonly accepted are the United Kennel Club and the United Kennel Club International, although the UKCI still only recognizes them as a variation of the Rat Terrier. In 1999, both \\"Rat Terrier\\" and ‚ÄúTeddy Roosevelt Terrier\\" were accepted as a separate breeds by the United Kennel Club. Currently, the UKC accepts single Teddy Roosevelt Terrier registration applications for dogs from 10 different registries, where they are simply designated as Rat Terriers. . Appearance Adult male, showing proper proportions. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a low-set, muscular, active, small- to medium-sized hunting terrier. The preferred ratio of length of body (prosternum to point of buttocks) to height (withers to ground) is between 10:7 and 10:8. The head is broad, slightly domed, wedge-shaped, and proportionate to the size of the body. Ears are V-shaped, set at the outside edges of the skull, and may be erect or button. A docked tail is preferred, but a natural bob tail or a natural tail carried in an upward curve is also acceptable. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier occurs in solid white, other solid colors with markings, and white with a variety of colored patches. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier should be evaluated as a working terrier, and exaggerations, or faults, should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog's ability to work. Honorable scars resulting from field work are not to be penalized. Adult male Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Disqualification: A longer-legged, square-bodied dog, whose proportions vary significantly from the desired ratio, lacks breed type, and must be disqualified. Common characteristics Like the Rat Terrier, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier of today is bred for versatility, including hunting instincts, soundness of health, great temperament, and good looks. Teddy Roosevelt Terriers have higher than average prey drive and will chase squirrels, rats, stray cats, and any other animals they consider prey. They also dig and follow mole trails, leaving an array of trenches and holes behind. They make excellent watch dogs, and can be very protective and territorial. They share a love for their families and become very attached, craving human interaction and affection. Always by their owners' sides, they become constant shadows, following their masters around throughout the daily routine. These dogs are very smart and loyal, which makes them easy to train. They are energetic and playful, and their antics can make one laugh daily. However, when it is time to settle down, they are just as content to be in a lap. They can adapt to almost any lifestyle, whether shown in conformation rings, working in agility trials, or just a great companion for home or farm. Their size makes them suitable for apartment living, as well. Today, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is gaining a solid following and becoming a popular household companion.(Source AKC) Health problems Less common problems may include allergies, bite problems (malocclusions), hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and subluxating patella, as these are problems that appear in the related Rat Terrier. Ectopia lentis, a congenital condition, also affects this breed. Although not currently well-documented in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, it is seen in small numbers and populations according to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, but is still seen in higher numbers in the Rat Terrier and other terrier breeds.Sargan DR, J Hered (2007) 98(5): 534-538 Mapping the Mutation Causing Lens Luxation in Several Terrier BreedsOrthopedic Foundation for Animals Public Database References Further reading * Bishop, Joseph Bucklin, ed.

Life He was the son of Louis I, Count of Nevers, and Joan, Countess of Rethel, and grandson of Robert III of Flanders. He succeeded his father as count of Nevers and his grandfather as count of Flanders in 1322. In 1320 Louis married Margaret, second daughter of King Philip V of France and Joan II, Countess of Burgundy, who would later inherit her mother's counties of Burgundy and Artois in 1361. This marriage alliance made him break with the anti-French policy of his grandfather Robert III and great-grandfather Guy I. Count of Flanders Louis' pro-French policies and excessive taxations levied by Louis caused an uprising in 1323. Beginning as a series of scattered rural riots, the peasant insurrection escalated into a full-scale rebellion that dominated public affairs in Flanders for nearly five years until 1328. The rebels, led by Nicolaas Zannekin, captured the towns of Nieuwpoort, Veurne, Ieper and Kortrijk. In Kortrijk, Zannekin was able to capture Louis himself. On 30 November 1325 in the church of St. Basil, Louis swore amnesty to the rebels, investigation of John of Namur's actions as regent, and approval of all actions take by regent Robert of Cassel. The following day, Louis was released and fled to Paris. On 26 April 1326, the King of France, Charles IV, intervened and the Peace of Arques was sealed. This treaty presented the King of France as the aggrieved party, leaving Louis as a bystander. The treaty, not supported by rebel districts in Flanders, did not last long, and soon hostilities erupted again. Philip VI of France to come to Louis' aid, and Zannekin and his adherents were decisively defeated by the French royal army in the Battle of Cassel. Control of Flanders was returned to Louis, with the warning from Philip that if Louis needed rescued again that Flanders would be incorporated into the kingdom of France. When the Hundred Years War started, Louis remained steadfast in his French policy, even with the county being economically dependent on England. His actions resulted in a boycott of the wool trade imposed by King Edward III of England, which in turn sparked a new insurrection in 1337 under Jacob van Artevelde. In 1339 the count had to flee his lands, never being able to return. Louis was killed at the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346.

Mathiez emphasized class conflict. He argued that 1789 pitted the bourgeoisie against the aristocracy and then the Revolution pitted the bourgeoisie against the sans-culottes, who were a proletariat-in-the-making. Mathiez greatly influenced Georges Lefebvre and Albert Soboul in forming what came to be known as the orthodox Marxist interpretation of the Revolution.Paul R Hansen, Contesting the French Revolution (2009) pp 4, 127-8, 172 Mathiez admired Maximilien Robespierre, praised the Reign of Terror and did not extend complete sympathy to the struggle of the proletariat.Friguglietti, (1974)  Career  Mathiez came from a peasant family in Eastern France, being born in La Bruy√®re, Haute-Sa√¥ne. He showed high intelligence as a young student, with a strong interest in history. He entered the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1894, by which time he had already displayed a strong anti-clerical bias. After graduation, he passed the aggregation in history and after doing his military service entered the teaching profession. He taught at a variety of local lyc√®es until he completed his doctorate which he wrote under the direction of Fran√ßois Victor Alphonse Aulard, then the leading historian of the Revolution, who admired Georges Danton. Mathiez was greatly influenced by Jean Jaur√®s, who propounded a more radical economic and social interpretation. At first a good friend of Aulard, he broke with his mentor in 1907, founding his own society, the Soci√©t√© des √©tudes robespierristes, with its journal, the Annales r√©volutionnaires. He also moved up from the lyc√©e to the university level, teaching at Besan√ßon and Dijon. Earlier a pacifist, Mathiez developed into a nationalistic Jacobin after the World War I erupted in 1914. He used his scholarship on the Revolution to demonstrate that just as Revolutionary France had defeated the allied coalition in the 1790s, so too the Third Republic would triumph over Imperial Germany. Wth its serious economic and social stresses such as shortages of food and rationing, the war prompted him to study similar conditions during the Revolution. The eventual result was one of his most original works, La Vie ch√®re et le movement social sous la Terreur (1927). In his masterwork La R√©volution fran√ßaise (3 vol. 1922‚Äì1924), Mathiez boldly made Maximilien Robespierre the hero.Friguglietti, (1974) √âmile Durkheim's work in the sociology of religion influenced his interpretation of the 1790s. Mathiez saw the French Revolution as the critical first stage in a proletarian advance that would gather strength in the revolutions of 1848, the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Russian revolts of 1905 and reached its highest point during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia which created a dictatorship in the name of the proletariat. Mathiez rejected the common view of Robespierre as demagogic, dictatorial and fanatical. Mathiez argued he was an eloquent spokesman for the poor and oppressed, an enemy of royalist intrigues, a vigilant adversary of dishonest and corrupt politicians, a guardian of the French Republic, an intrepid leader of the French Revolutionary government and a prophet of a socially responsible state.Albert Mathiez, \\"Robespierre: l'histoire et la l√©gende,\\" Annales historiques de la R√©volution fran√ßaise (1977) 49#1 pp 3-31. Mathiez held the highly prestigious Sorbonne chair in French Revolutionary Studies and was the founder of the Societe des Etudes Robespierristes which led to the creation in 1908 of the highly regarded journal Annales r√©volutionnaries that became Annales historiques de la R√©volution fran√ßaise in 1924. Mathiez was active in the French Communist Party from 1920 to 1922. By 1930, he was attacked by Stalinist historians, who condemned Mathiez and his Jacobinism as adversaries of the proletarian revolution. He was a vigorous polemicist. In his own defense after 1930, he mounted a sharp critique of Stalinism.Friguglietti, (1974)  Notes   Further reading  * Friguglietti, James.

The plaque near the altar at St.Luke's Church remembering the work of Ivan Corea, the longest serving vicar of the church and his wife Ouida Corea. Born in Chilaw, Ceylon, he was the son of James Alfred Ernest Corea and Letitia Grace Alice Seneviratne. His uncles were the famed freedom fighters of Sri Lanka, Charles Edgar Corea and Victor Corea who founded the Chilaw Association and the Ceylon National Congress. Ivan Corea was a direct descendant of King Dominicus Corea, also known as Edirille Rala. He was crowned King of Kotte and Sitawaka by Vimala Dharma Suriya, King of Kandy, in 1596. The great Mahatma Gandhi met Ivan Corea's father when he was hosted by the Corea Family in Chilaw, on his first and only visit to Ceylon in 1927. The young Corea was educated at Royal College Colombo. He joined the clergy of the Anglican Church of Ceylon in 1926, an early posting was at St.Phillip's Church in Kurana, Katunayake. Having spent several years in the priesthood, Corea was appointed Chaplain to the Bishop of Colombo. He was also made a Canon of the Cathedral Church of Christ in his sacerdotal silver jubilee. In the 1960s, Corea was appointed Rural Dean of Colombo, of the Church of Ceylon. St. Luke's Church Borella He was Vicar of St. Luke's Church Borella for over 25 years (1929‚Äì1954). Corea and his wife Ouida Corea played a key role in re-building St. Luke's Church in Borella. The edifice was designed by Corea, including the designs on each pillar, the octagonal tower of the sanctuary, the doors and windows, and all decorative motifs within the church. The foundation stone for the extension was laid on 17 October 1938 by the Commissary of the Bishop of Colombo, F. L. Beven. Archdeacon Beven wrote of the architecture of St. Luke's Church, Borella: 'It is an example how an unattractive old Church, which needs re- building, can be re-built in stages, with functional structure for all liturgical needs, in Sinhalese style, and provide attractive exterior and interior in a Church.' F.Lorenz Beven,(Archdeacon), A History of the Diocese of Colombo, (Colombo Diocese, 1946) The Church celebrated its Diamond Jubilee during Corea's time. The Bishop of Colombo, Bishop Horsley, consecrated the church on the day of its diamond jubilee on 30 June 1941. This was a time of great revival and several missionary activities took place at St. Luke's Church, Borella. The church attracted a huge congregation, one of the largest in Colombo, hence the need for the extension. The Easter Sunday Raid St. Luke's Church was packed on Easter Sunday morning (5 April) 1942 when Admiral Chuichi Nagumo and the Japanese Imperial Navy attacked the city of Colombo, Ceylon, during World War II. Among the congregation attending the Easter Sunday service were British and Ceylonese military personnel. The zero fighters and bombers were led by Captain Mitsuo Fuchida, who also led the attack on Pearl Harbor. The attack commenced around 7.30 a.m.; Corea was preaching at the time, when according to the parishioners of St. Luke's, the RAF Hawker Hurricanes swooped over the church to engage the Japanese Zero fighters in dogfights above the skies of Borella.Vernon Corea's Ceylon - reference to Japanese raid over St. Luke's Church Borella Service to the community Sri Lankan Church historian, Kumudu Amarasingham, writing in Lanka Library notes:The church launched several missionary activities and social service projects in the Wanathamulla area and with the Rodiya community in Narahenpita. Women and girls were taught needlework at the sewing classes. There was a night school at which the boys were taught English.A few years later girls were given nursing classes by the St. John‚Äôs Ambulance Brigade which helped them to find employment as nurses and aides in the hospitals. The Bible teachers were very active and Dr. Abraham Perera and his wife built a residence for them. There were Missions of Revival and Healing.The Healing Mission of Bishop Dr. Pakenam Walsh made headline news in September 1942. There was an annual week of witness prior to St. Luke‚Äôs Festival on 18 October. A special service for those in the medical profession was held at St. Luke‚Äôs which was very well attended by those in the healthcare service. There was also a daily morning service at 5.30 a.m. which was attended by medical personnel before reporting for duty. While at St. Luke's Church, Corea and his wife ministered to the poorest of the poor, the Rodiya Community, over a period of 18 years. He even housed members of the Rodi Community on Church property in Castle Street, Colombo. Ivan Corea and his wife Ouida Corea, reached out to the poorest sections of society in Sri Lanka - including the Rodiya Community. He housed the Rodi on church property in Borella, Colombo. St. Paul's Church, Milagiriya. St. Paul's Church in Milagiriya Following the death of his wife, Ouida, Corea left St. Luke's Church in 1954 and was appointed Vicar of St. Paul's Church in Milagiriya, one of the oldest churches in Ceylon. The church was first built by the Portuguese in the 15th Century as a Roman Catholic church. The British built a new church in 1848 and called it St. Paul's. He built the Lucien Jansz Memorial at St. Paul's Church Milagiriya as well as re-building St.Peter's Church in Pamankada. Diocese of Colombo The Bishop of Colombo appointed a Historical Select Committee in 1941 to compile a history of the diocese, to mark the celebration of the centennial of the foundation of the diocese. Corea was co-opted to the Committee by the Bishop and served as Secretary.F.Lorenz Beven on 'The Historical Select Committee,' A History of the Diocese of Colombo, (Colombo Diocese 1946), Corea is also mentioned in this historic church volume as 'one of four men who not only distinguished themselves in Theology, but also had the privilege of assisting their teacher in later years as Lecturers in the Divinity School. H.V.Ivan S.Corea has been honoured by the Bishop by being called to the office and dignity of an Examining Chaplain to the Lord Bishop of Colombo.'F.Lorenz Beven, 'Church Institutions,' page 306 A History of the Diocese of Colombo, (Colombo Diocese, 1946) Corea also served on the Diocesan Council of the Centenary Year in 1945. He was a contributor to the 'Church Times' newspaper in the United Kingdom. Corea died in Madampe in 1968. He will always be remembered as a priest who championed the rights of the poor in Sri Lanka. Among those who paid their respects at his funeral in Maha Nuge Gardens, Colombo were the Governor-General of Ceylon William Gopallawa, the Prime Minister of Ceylon Dudley Senanayake and the Finance Minister Junius Richard Jayewardene. The funeral service was led by Harold De Soyza, the first ever Sri Lankan Anglican Bishop of Colombo. The Ceylon Daily News of 1968 noted: \\"The Rt. Reverend Harold De Soysa, Bishop of Colombo paid tribute to the late Canon Corea referring to his ministry of loving service and made particular reference to his work on the history of the Diocese of Colombo.\\" At the time of his death, Corea was editing a revised version of A History of the Church of Ceylon. 'piyaneni' song Corea was immortalised in a song in the 1970s when the Sri Lankan superstar Clarence Wijewardena composed 'Piyaneni' (Father) in memory of this much loved priest, who worked tirelessly for the poor. 'Piyaneni' was sung by Wijewardena's music partner, superstar Annesley Malewana and recorded at Auggie Ranaweera's studio in Bambalapitiya, in Colombo. Another famed Sri Lankan musician, Helen Lucas was on the electric organ and the backing was provided by the Super Golden Chimes. 'Piyaneni' went on to become a huge hit in South Asia.

The next order for the type was from the Southern Pacific; these differed in being cab forward locomotives, so that the crew could have better visibility and breathing in the SP's long tunnels and snow sheds. They were very successful, and SP continued to order cab-forward locomotives, building an eventual fleet of 256 of numerous classes; later cab- forwards were 4-8-8-2s. The 2-8-8-2 proved itself to be a capable hauler on mountain grades, enabling the replacement of several smaller locomotives and hauling longer trains than before. Most of them were not fast; they hauled at drag freight speeds, up to . However, the Norfolk & Western Y6 class were designed to run up to . The locomotives were adopted by a broad spectrum of mountain railroads, including the Norfolk & Western, Southern, Virginian, Great Northern, Clinchfield, Denver & Rio Grande, Reading, Western Maryland, Missouri Pacific, Frisco, and the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway. On many railroads, the locomotives of the type were the most powerful on the roster. When built, the 2-8-8-2s of the Western Pacific Railroad were among the most powerful steam locomotives in the world and formed the basis for the later 2-8-8-4 \\"Yellowstone\\" type engines used by the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range. The very last compound Mallet locomotives to operate on major railroads in the United States were the 2-8-8-2 Y6b class of the Norfolk and Western Railway. After their final modifications in the 1950s, they were said to be capable of 170,000 lbs tractive effort in simple-expansion mode, although some have questioned this claim (the original design tractive effort was 152,206 lbs SIMPLE and 126,838 lbs COMPOUND). The last were retired in May 1960. As of 2008, there are two surviving 2-8-8-2 locomotives, both former Norfolk & Western. N&W; 2050 is from the railroad's Y3a class; Alco's Richmond works built it in 1923 and it is displayed at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois.

A prominent example of such an explanation is the color of gold: due to relativistic effects, it is not silvery like most other metals.Relativistic Effects in Chemistry: More Common Than You Thought January 2012Annual Review of Physical Chemistry 63(1):45-64 DOI: 10.1146/annurev-physchem-032511-143755 The term relativistic effects was developed in light of the history of quantum mechanics. Initially quantum mechanics was developed without considering the theory of relativity. Relativistic effects are those discrepancies between values calculated by models that consider and that do not consider relativity. Relativistic effects are important for the heavier elements with high atomic numbers. In the most common layout of the periodic table, these elements are shown in the lower area. Examples are the lanthanides and actinides. Relativistic effects in chemistry can be considered to be perturbations, or small corrections, to the non-relativistic theory of chemistry, which is developed from the solutions of the Schr√∂dinger equation. These corrections affect the electrons differently depending on the electron speed relative to the speed of light. Relativistic effects are more prominent in heavy elements because only in these elements do electrons attain sufficient speeds for the elements to have properties that differ from what non-relativistic chemistry predicts. History Beginning in 1935, Bertha Swirles described a relativistic treatment of a many-electron system, in spite of Paul Dirac's 1929 assertion that the only imperfections remaining in quantum mechanics \\"give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass and velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei.\\" Theoretical chemists by and large agreed with Dirac's sentiment until the 1970s, when relativistic effects were observed in heavy elements. The Schr√∂dinger equation had been developed without considering relativity in Schr√∂dinger's 1926 paper.Erwin Schr√∂dinger, Annalen der Physik, (Leipzig) (1926), Main paper Relativistic corrections were made to the Schr√∂dinger equation (see Klein‚ÄìGordon equation) to explain the fine structure of atomic spectra, but this development and others did not immediately trickle into the chemical community. Since atomic spectral lines were largely in the realm of physics and not in that of chemistry, most chemists were unfamiliar with relativistic quantum mechanics, and their attention was on lighter elements typical for the organic chemistry focus of the time. Dirac's opinion on the role relativistic quantum mechanics would play for chemical systems is wrong for two reasons. First, electrons in s and p atomic orbitals travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Second, relativistic effects cause indirect consequences that are especially evident for d and f atomic orbitals. Qualitative treatment Relativistic Œ≥ as a function of velocity. For a small velocity, the E_{\\\\rm rel} (ordinate) is equal to E_0=m c^2 but as v_{\\\\rm e}\\\\to c the E_{\\\\rm rel} goes to infinity. One of the most important and familiar results of relativity is that the relativistic mass of the electron increases by :m_{\\\\rm rel}=\\\\frac{m_{\\\\rm e}}{\\\\sqrt{1-(v_{\\\\rm e}/c)^2}} where \\\\displaystyle m_e, v_e, c are the electron rest mass, velocity of the electron, and speed of light respectively. The figure at the right illustrates the relativistic effects on the mass of an electron as a function of its velocity. This has an immediate implication on the Bohr radius (\\\\displaystyle a_0) which is given by :a_0=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m_{\\\\rm e} c \\\\alpha} where \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck's constant and Œ± is the fine-structure constant (a relativistic correction for the Bohr model). Arnold Sommerfeld calculated that, for a 1s orbital electron of a hydrogen atom with an orbiting radius of 0.0529 nm, Œ± ‚âà 1/137. That is to say, the fine-structure constant shows the electron traveling at nearly 1/137 the speed of light. One can extend this to a larger element with an atomic number Z by using the expression v ‚âà Zc/137 for a 1s electron, where v is its radial velocity. For gold with Z = 79, v ‚âà 0.58 c, so the 1s electron will be going 58% of the speed of light. Plugging this in for v/c in the equation for the relativistic mass one finds that mrel = 1.22me, and in turn putting this in for the Bohr radius above one finds that the radius shrinks by 22%. If one substitutes the relativistic mass into the equation for the Bohr radius it can be written :a_{\\\\rm rel}=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\sqrt{1-(v_{\\\\rm e}/c)^2}}{m_{\\\\rm e} c \\\\alpha} Ratio of relativistic and nonrelativistic Bohr radii, as a function of electron velocity It follows that :\\\\frac{a_{\\\\rm rel}}{a_0} =\\\\sqrt{1-(v_{\\\\rm e}/c)^2} At right, the above ratio of the relativistic and nonrelativistic Bohr radii has been plotted as a function of the electron velocity. Notice how the relativistic model shows the radius decreasing with increasing velocity. When the Bohr treatment is extended to hydrogenic atoms, the Bohr radius becomes :r=\\\\frac{n^2}{Z}a_0=\\\\frac{n^2\\\\hbar^2 4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0}{m_{\\\\rm e}Ze^2} where n is the principal quantum number and Z is an integer for the atomic number. In the Bohr model, the angular momentum is given as mv_{\\\\rm e}r=n\\\\hbar. Substituting into the equation above and solving for v_{\\\\rm e} gives :r = \\\\frac{n^2 a_0}{Z} = \\\\frac{n \\\\hbar}{m v_{\\\\rm e}} :v_{\\\\rm e} = \\\\frac{Z}{n^2 a_0} \\\\frac{n \\\\hbar}{m} :\\\\frac{v_{\\\\rm e}}{c} = \\\\frac{Z \\\\alpha}{n} = \\\\frac{Z e^2}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\hbar c n} From this point atomic units can be used to simplify the expression into :v_{\\\\rm e}=\\\\frac{Z}{n} Substituting this into the expression for the Bohr ratio mentioned above gives :\\\\frac{a_{\\\\rm rel}}{a_0}=\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z}{nc}\\\\right)^2} At this point one can see that a low value of n and a high value of Z results in \\\\frac{a_{\\\\rm rel}}{a_0} < 1. This fits with intuition: electrons with lower principal quantum numbers will have a higher probability density of being nearer to the nucleus. A nucleus with a large charge will cause an electron to have a high velocity. A higher electron velocity means an increased electron relativistic mass, and as a result the electrons will be near the nucleus more of the time and thereby contract the radius for small principal quantum numbers. Periodic table deviations The periodic table was constructed by scientists who noticed periodic trends in known elements of the time. Indeed, the patterns found in it is what gives the periodic table its power. Many of the chemical and physical differences between the 6th period (Cs-Rn) and the 5th period (Rb-Xe) arise from the larger relativistic effects for the former. These relativistic effects are particularly large for gold and its neighbors, platinum and mercury. An important quantum relativistic effect is the Van der Waals force. =Mercury= Mercury (Hg) is a liquid down to ‚àí39¬∞C (see Melting Point (m.p.)). Bonding forces are weaker for Hg‚ÄìHg bonds than for its immediate neighbors such as cadmium (m.p. 321¬∞C) and gold (m.p. 1064¬∞C). The lanthanide contraction is a partial explanation; however, it does not entirely account for this anomaly. In the gas phase mercury is alone in metals in that it is quite typically found in a monomeric form as Hg(g). Hg22+(g) also forms and it is a stable species due to the relativistic shortening of the bond. Hg2(g) does not form because the 6s2 orbital is contracted by relativistic effects and may therefore only weakly contribute to any bonding; in fact Hg‚ÄìHg bonding must be mostly the result of van der Waals forces, which explains why the bonding for Hg‚ÄìHg is weak enough to allow for Hg to be a liquid at room temperature. Au2(g) and Hg(g) are analogous, at the least in having the same nature of difference, to H2(g) and He(g). It is for the relativistic contraction of the 6s2 orbital that gaseous mercury can be called a pseudo noble gas. = Color of gold and caesium = Spectral reflectance curves for aluminum (Al), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) metal mirrors Alkali metal coloration: rubidium (silvery) versus caesium (golden) The reflectivity of aluminum (Al), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) is shown in the graph to the right. The human eye sees electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength near 600 nm as yellow. Gold appears yellow because it absorbs blue light more than it absorbs other visible wavelengths of light; the reflected light reaching the eye is therefore lacking in blue compared to the incident light. Since yellow is complementary to blue, this makes a piece of gold under white light appear yellow to human eyes. The electronic transition from the 5d orbital to the 6s orbital is responsible for this absorption. An analogous transition occurs in silver, but the relativistic effects are smaller than in gold. While silver's 4d orbital experiences some relativistic expansion and the 5s orbital some contraction, the 4d-5s distance in silver is much greater than the 5d-6s distance in gold. The relativistic effects increase the 5d orbital's distance from the atom's nucleus and decrease the 6s orbital's distance. Caesium, the heaviest of the alkali metals which can be collected in quantities sufficient for viewing, has a golden hue, whereas the other alkali metals are silver- white. However, relativistic effects are not very significant at Z = 55 for caesium (not far from Z = 47 for silver). The golden colour of caesium comes from the decreasing frequency of light required to excite electrons of the alkali metals as the group is descended. For lithium through rubidium this frequency is in the ultraviolet, but for caesium it enters the blue‚Äìviolet end of the spectrum; in other words, the plasmonic frequency of the alkali metals becomes lower from lithium to caesium. Thus caesium transmits and partially absorbs violet light preferentially while other colours (having lower frequency) are reflected; hence it appears yellowish. =Lead‚Äìacid battery= Without relativity, lead would be expected to behave much like tin, so tin- acid batteries should work just as well as the lead-acid batteries commonly used in cars. However, calculations show that about 10 V of the 12 V produced by a six-cell lead-acid battery arises purely from relativistic effects, explaining why tin-acid batteries do not work. =Inert pair effect= In Tl(I) (thallium), Pb(II) (lead), and Bi(III) (bismuth) complexes a 6s2 electron pair exists. The inert pair effect is the tendency of this pair of electrons to resist oxidation due to a relativistic contraction of the 6s orbital. =Other effects= Additional phenomena commonly caused by relativistic effects are the following: *Metallophilic interactions *The stability of the gold anion, Au‚àí, in compounds such as CsAu *The crystal structure of lead, which is face-centered cubic instead of diamond-like *The striking similarity between zirconium and hafnium *The stability of the uranyl cation, as well as other high oxidation states in the early actinides (Pa-Am) *The small atomic radii of franciumhttps://www.compoundchem.com/2019/11/06/iypt087-francium/ and radium *About 10% of the lanthanide contraction is attributed to the relativistic mass of high velocity electrons and the smaller Bohr radius that results *In the case of gold, significantly more than 10% of its contraction is due to relativistically heavy electrons, and gold (element 79) is almost twice as dense as lead (element 82) *Tendency of lower transition metals to form anions, example is platinum, which aside from oxidation states of (I), (II), (III) and (IV), also forms Pt-, and Pt2-.

He is best known as a member of the bluegrass ensemble the Kentucky Colonels and the rock band the Byrds, as well as for being a pioneer of the musical genre of country rock during the late 1960s. White also worked extensively as a session musician, appearing on recordings by the Everly Brothers, Joe Cocker, Ricky Nelson, Pat Boone, the Monkees, Randy Newman, Gene Clark, Linda Ronstadt, Arlo Guthrie, and Jackson Browne among others. Together with frequent collaborator Gene Parsons, he invented the B-Bender, a guitar accessory that enables a player to mechanically bend the B-string up a whole tone and emulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar. White was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Association Hall of Fame in 2016. Early years Clarence Joseph LeBlanc was born on June 7, 1944 in Lewiston, Maine. The LeBlanc family, who later changed their surname to White, were of French-Canadian ancestry and hailed from New Brunswick, Canada. Clarence's father, Eric LeBlanc, Sr., played guitar, banjo, fiddle, and harmonica, ensuring that his offspring grew up surrounded by music. A child prodigy, Clarence began playing guitar at the age of six. At such a young age he was barely able to hold the instrument and as a result, he briefly switched to ukulele, awaiting a time when his young hands would be big enough to confidently grapple with the guitar. In 1954, when Clarence was ten, the White family relocated to Burbank, California and soon after, Clarence joined his brothers Roland and Eric Jr. (who played mandolin and banjo respectively) in a trio called Three Little Country Boys. Although they initially started out playing contemporary country music, the group soon switched to a purely bluegrass repertoire, as a result of Roland's burgeoning interest in the genre. In 1957, banjoist Billy Ray Latham and Dobro player LeRoy Mack were added to the line-up, with the band renaming themselves the Country Boys soon after. In 1961, the Country Boys also added Roger Bush on double bass, as a replacement for Eric White, Jr. That same year, Clarence and other members of the Country Boys appeared on two episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. Between 1959 and 1962, the group released three singles on the Sundown, Republic and Briar International record labels. The Kentucky Colonels Following the recording sessions for the Country Boys' debut album, the band changed its name to the Kentucky Colonels in September 1962, at the suggestion of country guitarist and friend Joe Maphis. The band's album was released by Briar International under the title The New Sound of Bluegrass America in early 1963. Around this time, Clarence's flatpicking guitar style was becoming a much more prominent part of the group's music. After attending a performance by Doc Watson at the Ash Grove folk club in Los Angeles, where he also met the guitarist, Clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitar's role in bluegrass music. At that time, the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass, with only a few performers, such as Doc Watson, exploring its potential for soloing. White soon began to integrate elements of Watson's playing style, including the use of open strings and syncopation, into his own flatpicking guitar technique. His breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrument was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrass. The Kentucky Colonels became well known on the bluegrass circuit during this period and made many live appearances throughout California and the United States. Between bookings with the Colonels, White also made a guest appearance on Eric Weissberg and Marshall Brickman's New Dimensions in Banjo & Bluegrass album, which would be re-released in 1973 as the soundtrack album to the film Deliverance (with Weissberg and Steve Mandell's version of \\"Dueling Banjos\\" added to the album's track listing). Throughout 1964, the Colonels continued to make live appearances at various clubs, concert halls and festivals, as well as recruiting fiddle player Bobby Sloan into their ranks. The Colonels' second album, Appalachian Swing!, was a commercial success and saw White's flatpicking permanently expand the language of bluegrass guitar. Music critic Thom Owens has remarked that White's playing on the album, \\"helped pioneer a new style in bluegrass; namely, he redefined the acoustic guitar as a solo instrument.\\" Shortly after the recording of the Appalachian Swing! album, Roland and Clarence undertook some session work backing dobroist Tut Taylor on a Dobro-themed album that was released by World Pacific in late 1964 as Dobro Country. Although the brothers were employed as session musicians, the album was credited to Tut Taylor, Roland and Clarence White upon release. Although they were a successful recording act, it was becoming increasingly difficult for the Colonels to make a living, due to the waning popularity of the American folk music revival due to the British Invasion and homegrown folk rock acts, such as the Byrds and Bob Dylan. As a result, the Colonels switched to electric instrumentation and hired a drummer. In spite of these changes, the Kentucky Colonels dissolved as a band following a show on October 31, 1965. Clarence, Roland and Eric Jr. formed a new line-up of the Colonels in 1966, with several other musicians, but this second version of the group was short-lived and by early 1967 they had broken up. Session work (1966‚Äì1968) During 1964, White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards rock 'n' roll as an avenue for artistic expression. Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like Doc Watson, Don Reno and Joe Maphis, he also idolized the playing of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, rock 'n' roller Chuck Berry, and studio musician James Burton. White even anticipated the viability of a folk/rock hybrid when, in the summer of 1964, he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" with electric instruments. However, despite White's enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment's validity and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson's proteges, the Byrds. By the time the original line-up of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965, White had become a respected and well- known guitarist. Abandoning bluegrass temporarily, he switched from his Martin D-28 acoustic guitar to an electric Fender Telecaster, with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burton. Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique, switch from open chording to fretting the whole guitar neck with his left hand, and practice using the tone and volume controls. However, he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and, between 1965 and 1968, he undertook session work for artists including Ricky Nelson, the Monkees, and the Gosdin Brothers. As 1965 turned into 1966, White met Gene Parsons and Gib Guilbeau at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and shortly after, he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs, as well as doing regular session work on their records, which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Gene. 1966 also saw White begin playing with a country group called Trio, which featured drummer Bart Haney and former Kentucky Colonel, Roger Bush, on bass. In autumn of that year, as a result of his friendship with Gilbeau, Parsons and the Gosdin Brothers, White was asked to provide lead guitar to ex-Byrd Gene Clark's debut solo album, Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers. White briefly joined Clark's touring band shortly thereafter. During the Clark album sessions, White reconnected with mandolin player and bassist Chris Hillman, who he had known during the early 1960s as a member of the bluegrass combo the Hillmen. Hillman was currently a member of the Byrds and, in December 1966, he invited White to contribute countrified lead guitar playing to his songs \\"Time Between\\" and \\"The Girl with No Name\\", which both appeared on the Byrds' Younger Than Yesterday album. The country-oriented nature of the songs was something of a stylistic departure for the group and can be seen as an early indicator of the experimentation with country music that would color the Byrds' subsequent work. White also contributed guitar to the band's follow-up album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, and to their seminal 1968 country rock release, Sweetheart of the Rodeo. Nashville West By mid-1967, White had begun performing at night in the band the Reasons (a.k.a. Nashville West), which included bass player Wayne Moore, along with Parsons and Guilbeau (as banjoist-turned-drummer and lead singer respectively). The band mostly worked at the Nashville West club in El Monte, California, frequently borrowing the club's name as their own. Critic Erik Hage has said that, in the years since their formation, the band have become legendary as one of the first to play a seamless blend of country and rock, although L.A. group the International Submarine Band, which featured country rock pioneer Gram Parsons (no relation to Gene), were also exploring a similar sound concurrently. A live recording of Nashville West would eventually be released in 1979, which music historian Richie Unterberger later described as being \\"of considerable historical interest for anyone interested in the roots of country-rock\\". Unterberger also remarked that the recording illustrated Nashville West as having \\"more electric rock influences than most country acts were using at the time.\\" In addition to being a member of Nashville West, White was also a member of another country bar band that regularly played at the Nashville West club called the Roustabouts. In July 1967, White signed with Gary Paxton's Bakersfield International record label and released a pair of solo singles: \\"Tango for a Sad Mood\\" b/w \\"Tuff and Stringy\\" and \\"Grandma Funderbunks Music Box\\" b/w \\"Riff Raff\\". He also reportedly recorded a solo album for the label, although it has never been released. The StringBender A schematic of the first Parsons/White StringBender (a.k.a. the B-Bender) During 1967, while they were both members of Nashville West, White and Parsons invented a device that enabled Clarence to simulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar on his 1954 Fender Telecaster. The need for such a device was driven by White's desire to bend his guitar's B-string up a full tone, while keeping his left hand on the strings and fretboard. In order to achieve this feat, White felt that he needed a third hand. The guitarist turned to his friend Parsons, who was an amateur machinist, and asked him to design and build an apparatus to pull or drop the B-string. The device, which was known as the Parsons/White StringBender (also known as the B-Bender), was a spring-lever mechanism built into the inside of White's guitar, which linked to the guitar's strap button and the B-string. When it was activated, by pulling down on the guitar neck, it pulled on the B-string and caused the guitar to simulate the \\"crying\\" sound of a pedal steel. White would go on to use the device extensively as a member of the Byrds and, as a result, the distinctive sound of the StringBender would become a defining characteristic of that band's music during White's tenure with the group. The Byrds Following the abrupt departure from the Byrds of singer and guitarist Gram Parsons in July 1968, White was invited to join the group as a full-time member, remaining until the band was finally dissolved by lead guitarist Roger McGuinn in February 1973. This extended tenure with the band makes White the second longest-serving member of the Byrds after McGuinn. White was brought into the group at bass player Chris Hillman's suggestion, as someone who could handle the band's older rock material and their newer country-flavored repertoire. Once he was a member of the Byrds, White began to express dissatisfaction with the band's current drummer, Kevin Kelley. Before long, he had persuaded McGuinn and Hillman to replace Kelley with his friend from the recently dissolved Nashville West, Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram). Hillman quit the Byrds within a month of White joining, in order to form the Flying Burrito Brothers with Gram Parsons. At around this same time, White and Gene Parsons undertook some informal rehearsing and recording with Hillman and Gram Parsons, as part of a prototype version of the Burrito Brothers. However, the pair declined an invitation to join the new country rock group and instead opted to stay with McGuinn's new-look Byrds. The White- era version of the Byrds, featuring McGuinn, White and Parsons, along with bassists John York (September 1968‚ÄìSeptember 1969) and Skip Battin (September 1969‚ÄìFebruary 1973), released five albums and toured relentlessly between 1969 and 1972. Journalist Steve Leggett has noted that, although the original line- up of the Byrds gets the most attention and praise, the latter-day version, featuring McGuinn and White's dual lead guitar work, was regarded by critics and audiences as much more accomplished in concert than any previous configuration of the band had been. Similarly, authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz have commented that although the White-era Byrds failed to achieve the commercial success of the original line-up, the group were a formidable live act and a consistently in-demand attraction on the touring circuit. The authors also cited the Byrds' archival release Live at the Fillmore ‚Äì February 1969 as a good example of the White-era band's musical potency. Rolling Stone journalist David Fricke has commented on White's contribution to the band, by noting, \\"with his powerful, impeccable tone and melodic ingenuity, White did much to rebuild the creative reputation of the Byrds and define the road- hearty sound of the group at the turn of the '70s.\\" The first Byrds' album to feature White as a full member was Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, which was released in early 1969. The album included a re-recording of the Gene Parsons and White- penned instrumental \\"Nashville West\\", as well as a rendition of the traditional song \\"Old Blue\\", which was the first Byrds' recording to utilize the StringBender. The Ballad of Easy Rider album followed in November 1969, on which White could be heard leading the band through a rendition of the traditional song \\"Oil in My Lamp\\", representing the guitarist's first lead vocal performance as a Byrd. 1970 saw the Byrds release the double album (Untitled), which consisted of one LP of live concert recordings and another of new studio recordings. Upon release, the album was a critical and commercial success on both sides of the Atlantic, peaking at number 40 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and reaching number 11 on the UK Albums Chart. Two of the album's studio recordings featured White singing lead vocals: a cover version of the Lowell George composition \\"Truck Stop Girl\\" and a rendition of Leadbelly's \\"Take a Whiff on Me\\" (the latter also featured White playing mandolin). In addition, excerpts from an instrumental jam, recorded during the (Untitled) album sessions and logged in the Columbia Records' files under the title of \\"Fifteen Minute Jam\\", were later released as \\"White's Lightning\\" and \\"White's Lightning Pt.2\\" on The Byrds box set and the remastered double CD version of (Untitled) respectively. Clarence White (third from left) on tour with the Byrds in the Netherlands, June 1970. The 1971 Byrdmaniax album saw White singing lead vocals on \\"My Destiny\\", written by Helen Carter, and \\"Jamaica Say You Will\\", penned by the then little-known songwriter Jackson Browne. In addition, White received a co-writing credit for the album's bluegrass instrumental \\"Green Apple Quick Step\\". This song also featured White's father, Eric White, Sr., on harmonica. Farther Along, released in November 1971, would prove to be the final album by the White-era Byrds. It featured White singing the Gospel hymn and title track \\"Farther Along\\" and a cover of the Larry Murray composition \\"Bugler\\". This latter song features White playing mandolin and has been described by Byrds expert Tim Connors as, \\"the best song on the album, and by far the best vocal ever recorded by Clarence White during his time with the Byrds.\\" Following the release of Farther Along, the band continued to tour throughout 1972, but no new Byrds album appeared. In late 1972, the original five-piece line-up of the Byrds reunited and, as a result, McGuinn decided to disband the existing version of the band. Parsons had been fired in July 1972 and Battin was dismissed by McGuinn in early 1973. The last concert by the White-era version of the Byrds (which at this point featured former Byrd Chris Hillman on bass and Joe Lala on drums) was given on February 24, 1973 at The Capitol Theatre, Passaic, New Jersey, with White and McGuinn jokingly firing each other from the band afterwards. Despite being on tour or in the recording studio with the Byrds for the majority of the time between 1969 and 1972, White continued to undertake selected session work for other recording artists. During this period he played on Joe Cocker's 1969 album Joe Cocker!, Randy Newman's 1970 album 12 Songs, and the Everly Brothers' Stories We Could Tell from 1972. In early 1971, White also contributed guitar to Paul Siebel's Jack-Knife Gypsy album and the title track of the L.A. Getaway album by Joel Scott-Hill, John Barbata and Chris Ethridge. Other albums that White contributed his guitar playing to while he was a member of the Byrds include Linda Ronstadt's Hand Sown ... Home Grown (1969), Rita Coolidge's Rita Coolidge (1971), Marc Benno's Minnows (1971), Jackson Browne's Jackson Browne (1972), Gene Clark's Roadmaster (1973), and a trio of Arlo Guthrie albums: Running Down the Road (1969), Washington County (1970) and Hobo's Lullaby (1972). Post-Byrds In mid-February 1973, just prior to the break up of the White-era version of the Byrds, White joined with guitarist Peter Rowan, mandolinist David Grisman, fiddler Richard Greene, and banjoist Bill Keith to form the bluegrass supergroup Muleskinner. The musicians initially assembled as a one-off pickup band to back bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe for a television program, but ended up performing on their own when Monroe's tour bus broke down on the way to the television studios. A recording of this broadcast, which was once thought lost, was released as an album in 1992, under the title Muleskinner Live. A VHS video cassette of the broadcast was also released in 1992 and later re- issued on DVD. As a result of the success of their appearance on the television broadcast, the band was offered a one album recording contract with Warner Bros. Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at the Record Plant in Los Angeles between March 27 and April 14, 1973, with Richard Greene and Joe Boyd producing. The music the band recorded for the Muleskinner album (a.k.a. A Potpourri of Bluegrass Jam) was in the vein of country rock, traditional bluegrass and progressive bluegrass (or \\"newgrass\\"). It was also one of the first bluegrass albums to feature a full drum kit. The album was released in the latter half of 1973 and is nowadays regarded by critics as a milestone in the development of progressive bluegrass, with ex-band members Greene, Keith, Grisman, and Rowan all going on to become important figures in the development of that genre. In addition to his work with Muleskinner, White also undertook a number of sessions between late 1972 and early 1973 for his friend Gene Parsons' debut solo album Kindling. White's distinctive guitar and mandolin playing can be heard on the tracks \\"Do Not Disturb\\", \\"On the Spot\\", \\"Sonic Bummer\\", \\"I Must Be a Tree\\", \\"Banjo Dog\\", \\"Back Again\\", and \\"Drunkard's Dream\\" (the latter of which also features White contributing harmony vocals). Following completion of the Muleskinner album in April 1973, White reunited with his brothers Roland and Eric Jr. for a tour as the White Brothers (a.k.a. The New Kentucky Colonels). After playing a handful of shows in California, the White Brothers departed for Europe in May 1973. Returning to the U.S., White's final bout of touring took place with the New Kentucky Colonels in June 1973, as part of a four-date country rock package tour with Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Country Gazette, Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Gene Parsons, Byron Berline, and Chris Ethridge among others. Although Gram and Clarence had been acquainted with one another since the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo sessions, the pair would develop a fast friendship during the mini-tour, after, what was by all accounts, a very acrimonious re-acquaintance. Following the end of the package tour, White entered the recording studio with producer Jim Dickson on June 28 and 29, 1973 to begin work on a solo album. He recorded a total of six songs, four of which would belatedly be released on the archival album Silver Meteor: A Progressive Country Anthology in 1980. Death White died on July 15, 1973, after being struck by a drunk driver. The accident occurred shortly after 2 a.m., while he and his brother Roland were loading equipment into their car in Palmdale, California, following a White Brothers concert. Especially shaken by his death was Gram Parsons, who would lead a singalong of \\"Farther Along\\" at the funeral service and conceive his final song before his own death, \\"In My Hour of Darkness\\", as a partial tribute to White. Clarence White was survived by his brothers Roland and Eric and sisters JoAnne and Rosemarie, and his one daughter, Michelle. Musical influence Clarence White helped popularize the acoustic guitar as a lead instrument in bluegrass music, building on the work of guitarists such as Doc Watson. Prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like Watson and White, the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument, save for a few exceptions (such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist Don Reno). Many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite White as a primary influence, including Dan Crary, Norman Blake, and Tony Rice. Rice owns and plays White's highly modified 1935 Martin D-28. David Grier and Russ Barenberg are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by White's guitar work. White's bluegrass playing with the Kentucky Colonels was also a considerable influence on Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, who traveled with the band during 1964. On the electric side of the guitar spectrum, White was similarly influential. Together with fellow Byrds bandmember Gene Parsons, White invented the B-Bender device. This device raises the B-string (second string) of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar. It is activated by pushing down on the neck, and produces a \\"pedal steel\\" type sound. Arlen Roth, heavily influenced by this style, did not at the time know that White and Parsons had invented a B-bender, so instead developed his own unique all-finger bending version of this technique. This was heavily documented in his ground-breaking book, \\"Nashville Guitar\\", all of his recordings, as well as his book \\"Masters of the Telecaster\\". Subsequently, his Telecaster sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing. Marty Stuart, another guitarist influenced by White's playing, now owns and regularly plays White's 1954 Fender Telecaster with the prototype B-Bender. Gill, Chris: \\"Steel And Wood, Heart And Soul - The Marty Stuart Guitar Collection,\\" reprinted from Guitar Player Magazine, August 1994. Music archivist and writer Alec Palao has called White \\"one of a handful of true greats amongst the instrumentalists of 20th century popular music\\", before adding that \\"the waves created by the guitarist's idiosyncratic style are still forming ripples within bluegrass, country and rock 'n' roll.\\" In 2003, White was ranked No. 41 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2010, guitar manufacturer Gibson ranked White at No. 42 on their Top 50 Guitarists of All Time list.

It was a staunch supporter of the House of Romanov and opposed any retreat from the autocracy of the reigning monarch.Norman Cohn, Warrant for Genocide, pp. 61, 73, 89, 120‚Äì2, 134, 139, 251. The name apparently arose from the Medieval concept of \\"black\\", or common (non-noble) people, organized into militias. The Black Hundreds were also noted for extremism and incitement to pogroms, nationalistic Russocentric doctrines, and different xenophobic beliefs, including anti-Ukrainian sentimentUkraine and Russia in Their Historical Encounter, by Peter J. Potichnyj, University of Alberta, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, 1992 (pp. 576, 582, 665). and anti- semitism.A People Apart: The Jews in Europe, 1789‚Äì1939, by David Vital, Oxford University Press, 1999 (pp. 140, 141). The ideology of Chernosotentsy is based on a slogan formulated by Count Uvarov \\"Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality\\". Pre-formation \\"Svjashchjennaja druzhina\\" (–°–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ωa—è –¥—Ä—É–∂–∏–Ωa, or The Holy Brigade) and \\"Russkoye sobraniye\\" (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–µ —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ, or Russian Assembly) in St. Petersburg are considered to be predecessors of the Black Hundreds. Starting in 1900, the two organizations united representatives of conservative intellectuals, government officials, Russian Orthodox clergy and landowners. A number of black-hundredist organizations formed during and after the Russian Revolution of 1905, such as: * \\"Soyuz russkogo naroda\\" (–°–æ—é–∑ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞, or Union of the Russian People) in St. Petersburg, * \\"Soyuz russkikh lyudey\\" (–°–æ—é–∑ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π, or Union of the Russians) in Moscow, * \\"Russkaya monarkhicheskaya partiya\\" (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –º–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—Ö–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—è, or Russian Monarchist Party) in Moscow and elsewhere, * \\"Obshchestvo aktivnoy bor'by s revolyutsiyey\\" (–û–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–π –±–æ—Ä—å–±—ã —Å —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–µ–π, or Society of Active Struggle Against Revolution) in Moscow, * \\"Belyy dvuglavyy oryol\\" (–ë–µ–ª—ã–π –¥–≤—É–≥–ª–∞–≤—ã–π –æ—Ä—ë–ª, or White Two-headed Eagle) in Odessa, Ukraine, and others. Predecessors Members of the Black Hundreds organizations came from different social strata‚Äîsuch as landowners, clergymen, the high and petty bourgeoisie, merchants, artisans, workers and the so-called \\"declassed elements\\". The Postojannij Sowjet Ob'jedinjonnych dworjanskjich obschjestw Rossii (United Gentry Council) guided the activities of the black-hundredists; the tsarist regime provided moral and financial support to the movement. The Black Hundreds were founded on a devotion to Tsar, church and motherland, expressed previously by the motto of Tsar Nicholas I: \\"Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality\\" (Pravoslawije, Samodjerschawije i Narodnostj). Despite certain program differences, all of the black-hundredist organizations had one goal in common, namely their struggle against the revolutionary movement. The black-hundredists conducted oral propaganda: in churches by holding special services, and during meetings, lectures and demonstrations. Such propaganda provoked antisemitic sentiments and monarchic \\"exaltation\\" and caused numerous pogroms and terrorist acts against revolutionaries and certain public figures, performed by the Black Hundreds' paramilitary groups, sometimes known as \\"Yellow Shirts\\". Compare: Popularity and power The Black Hundred movement published newspapers, such as Znamja (The Banner) or Russkoje znamja (Russian Banner), Potschajewskij Listok (The Pochayev Page), Semschina, Kolokol (Bell), Grosa (Thunderstorm), Vetschje and others. Many rightist newspapers, such as Moskowskije wedomosti (Moscow News), Graschdanin (Citizen) and Kievljanin (Kievan), published their materials as well. Among the prominent leaders of the Black Hundred movement were Alexander Dubrovin, Vladimir Purishkevich, Nikolai Markov, A. I. Trishatny, Pavel Krushevan, Pavel Bulatsel, Ivan Vostorgov, M. K. Shakhovskoy, Saint John of Kronstadt, Hieromonk Iliodor, Bishop Hermogen, and others. Incitement to violence Anti-\\"Black Hundred\\" satire. A certificate: \\"The bearer of this document is neither a student nor a member of the intelligentsia, and is thus not fit for beating\\" issued by the \\"Chief Directorate of Black Hundred\\" When two Duma delegates, Grigori Borisovich Iollos (Poltava province) and Mikhail Herzenstein (b. 1859, d. 1906 in Terijoki), both from the Constitutional Democratic Party, were assassinated by members of the Black Hundreds, their press organ Russkoe Znamya declared openly that \\"Real Russians assassinated Herzenstein and Iollos with knowledge of officials\\", and expressed regret that \\"only two Jews perished in the crusade against revolutionaries.\\" The black hundred were known to have used violence and torture on anyone they believed was a threat to the Tsar. Black Hundred and the Ukrainian question The Black Hundreds classified Ukrainians as Russians,Jacob Langer. (2007) Corruption and the Counterrevolution: The Rise and Fall of the Black Hundred History Dissertation, Duke University. pg.19 and attracted the support of many \\"Moscowphiles\\" who considered themselves Russian and rejected Ukrainian nationalism and identity.Encyclopedia of Ukraine. Black Hundreds University of Toronto, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies. The Black Hundred movement actively campaigned against what it considered to be Ukrainian separatism, as well as against promoting Ukrainian culture and language in general, and against the works of Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko, in particular.–£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å. ‚Äî –ú., 1912. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 5 ‚Äî –°. 82. In Odessa, the Black Hundreds shut down the local branch of the Ukrainian Prosvita society, an organization that was dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language and Ukrainian cultural awareness. All-Russian congresses The black-hundredists organized four all-Russian congresses with the purpose of uniting their forces. In October 1906, they elected the so-called glavnaya uprava (a kind of board of directors) of the new all-Russian black-hundredist organization \\"Ob‚Äôyedinyonniy russkiy narod\\" (–û–±—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥, or Russian People United). After 1907, however, this organization disintegrated, and the whole Black Hundreds movement became weaker as the membership rate steadily declined. During the February Revolution of 1917, the remaining black- hundredist organizations were officially abolished. After emigrating abroad, many black-hundredists became the main right-wing critics of the White movement. They blamed the movement for not only failing to stress monarchism as its key ideological foundation, but also supposedly being run under the influence of liberals and Freemasons. Boris Brasol (1885‚Äì1963), a former member of the Black Hundreds, was among those who later emigrated to the United States. There he befriended industrialist Henry Ford, who gave Brasol a job on The Dearborn Independent newspaper. Brasol also helped in the production of The International Jew.How Russia Shaped the Modern World by Steven G. Marks. Princeton University Press, 2003 (pp. 172‚Äì4) In popular culture * In Jack London's 1908 novel The Iron Heel, which predicts the rise of a hypothetical nationalist government in the US, the anti-labor hired thugs who are loyal to the regime use the name of the Black Hundreds. * In Bernard Malamud's 1966 novel The Fixer, which portrays Yakov Bok as a Jewish man who survived the pogrom and moved to Kiev, Yakov changes his last name to sound more Russian and soon becomes hired by a member of the Black Hundred. * In Edward Rutherfurd's 1991 novel Russka, a young Bobrov (one of the fictional families portrayed in the novel) is beaten in the street by a gang of young Black Hundreds for being Jewish-looking and being the son of a social democrat. * In Roots: The Next Generations, a Jewish friend of the series' black protagonists jokes that the Ku Klux Klansmen who burn down his shop are mere pikers next to the \\"Czar's Black One Hundred\\". * In Anatoli Rybakov‚Äôs 1988 novel Children of the Arbat, in part II, chapter 13, set in Moscow in the mid 1930s, the Sharoks' old neighborhood Okhotny Row is described as having many storekeepers who had been Black Hundreds.

He was born at Allanche in Cantal. He was educated for a profession in law and practised as avocat. During the troubled period which culminated in the taking of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, he became prominent in public affairs. He was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror and was only released by the counter- revolution of the 9th Thermidor. During the first consulate he was called to the tribunate but was excluded in 1802. In 1815 he was elected deputy for Cantal and finally left the Chamber on its dissolution in 1823. Ganilh is best known as the most vigorous defender of the mercantile school in opposition to the views of Adam Smith and the English economists.See biographical note in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31 (International Publishers: New York, 1989) p. 603. The mercantilists were believers in nations keeping a positive balance of trade at all times in order to prosper, economically. However, they also valued the maximization of the national domestic resources of that nation and a total ban on the export of gold and silver. In pursuit of the positive balance of trade they recommended expansion of the colonial system, exclusivity of trade with the colonies and forbidding trade carried in foreign ships. Britain attempted to follow the mercantilists' suggestions and found themselves involved in frequent trade wars like the four Anglo-Dutch Navigation Wars. On the scale of the individual sale, the mercantilists believed that profit arose only during the sale of commodities by the seller over-charging the buyer. Thus, Ganilh says that \\"exchange or trade alone gives value to things.\\" From the second (1821) edition of Ganilh's, Des systems d' economie politique quoted in the \\"Theories of Surplus Value\\" by Karl Marx contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31, p. 98. In his mercantile outlook, Ganilh rejected the general labor theory of Adam Smith and David Ricardo in which commodities have value from the beginning. Commodities obtain value only through the labor that is used to prepare the commodity for market.Karl Marx, \\"Theories of Surplus Value\\" contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31, p. 99. His works on political economy are clear and concise.

Supporters of the system refer to long established democracies the United Kingdom and Canada operating with this bicameralism with an appointed upper chamber and an elected lower chamber. Opponents of this system point out that unlike the bicameral systems in the UK and Canada, the Bahraini system gives the unelected upper house equal or more legislative power than the elected lower house, allowing the King to control all legislation. Opponents also point out that the current system was imposed unilaterally by the King, violating the 1973 Constitution and a 2001 signed agreement with the Bahraini opposition.

The film stars Christina Ricci and Jesse Eisenberg as two estranged siblings attacked by a werewolf loose in Los Angeles. Originally planned for 2003, the film is a notable example of development hell, taking over two more years to be made than originally planned, during which producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein kept asking for reshoots and changes to the plot, re-edited the movie to give a PG-13 rating rather than the original intended R-rating, and fired legendary makeup artist Rick Baker to replace the werewolves he had created with computer-generated ones. The film was a box-office failure and was panned by critics; Craven himself was very displeased with the final result. Plot On a seaside pier in Los Angeles, friends Jenny Tate and Becky Morton decide to get their fortune told by Zela. Zela foretells that they will suffer a horrible fate, but they don't believe her and walk away disgusted. That night, 16-year-old high-schooler Jimmy Myers is picked up on Mulholland Drive by his 24-year-old sister Ellie, who has just returned from visiting her boyfriend, Jake Taylor. Jimmy had a run-in with some bullies and his crush, Brooke. Driving home, Jimmy and Ellie collide with an animal and another car. They attempt to rescue the other driver, Becky Morton, but an unseen creature slashes the siblings before it drags Becky off and rips her in half. When interviewed by police, despite Jimmy's belief that it was a wolf or dog-type animal, the official report credits it to a bear or cougar. The next day at work, Ellie finds herself attracted to the scent of a coworkers blood. But she dismisses it. At a party, Jenny interrupts a conversation between Ellie and Jake. Annoyed that Jenny is flirting with Jake, Ellie leaves the party early. Soon after this Jenny heads down to the parking garage where she is chased and killed by a werewolf. Zela's predictions for both Jenny and Becky have come to pass. Jimmy does research about wolves in California and starts to believe that the creature was a werewolf, sharing his thoughts with a disbelieving Ellie. To ease Jimmy's concerns she touches a silver picture frame without getting burned. Jimmy is becoming much stronger and more aggressive, as shown when a bully named Bo coerces him to join the wrestling team. He easily defeats three wrestlers, including Bo, and calls Bo out for constantly making gay jokes towards him, saying that Bo himself is repressing his own homosexuality. Ellie starts to believe the werewolf hypothesis when she meets Zela, who warns about the effect the coming full moon will have. Jimmy proves they have been cursed when he holds a silver cake server and gets burned, discovering that the picture frame Ellie touched earlier was only stainless steel. Their dog, Zipper, bites Jimmy, tastes his blood, becomes a lycanthropoid monster, and goes on a rampage. Realizing what's happening, Jimmy goes to warn Ellie with Bo, who showed up at their house to confess that he is gay and has feelings for Jimmy; Bo is flatly rejected by Jimmy who believes the attraction to be his werewolf pheromones, but Bo still helps Jimmy. Ellie has deduced that Jake is a werewolf. He confirms it, but claims it wasn't he who attacked her and Jimmy. When a fourth werewolf attacks them, Bo and Jimmy try to help, but Bo is knocked out. The new werewolf turns back into Joanie, who was cursed after a one-night stand with Jake. She now wants revenge by killing all of the other girls Jake dates. When Jake refuses to let Joanie hurt Ellie, she knocks him out, then turns into werewolf form and starts attacking. Ellie and Jimmy fight her, and when the police arrive, the two draw her out by insulting her. The police open fire, apparently killing her in werewolf form, but she rises again as her head and heart are still connected. A policeman shoots her in the head, finally killing her. Bo is okay, but Jake has disappeared. Jimmy and Ellie return to a wrecked home. As Jimmy works to restore the power, Jake arrives. He reveals that since Joanie's curse was caused by him, the only way to cure it is to kill the werewolf who started the curse-line and wants to kill Jimmy (due to his alpha male instinct) and have Ellie live forever by his side. She and Jake fight, but her werewolf form emerges sporadically while he has complete control over his, dominating the fight. Werewolf Jimmy joins in, climbing across the ceiling and biting Jake, allowing Ellie to stab and badly injure Jake with the silver cake server. Ellie decapitates Jake with a shovel and breaks the curse on the two siblings (and Zipper). They watch as Jake's body bursts into flames. Bo, Brooke, and Zipper arrive at the house. Bo and Jimmy are now friends; Jimmy kisses Brooke and walks her home along with Bo. Ellie is stuck with the clean- up of the messy house.

Dimension co-founder Bob Weinstein announced in October 2002 that Cursed would \\"reinvent the werewolf genre,\\" and Wes Craven would direct, with the movie being released around August 2003. Christina Ricci, Skeet Ulrich, and Jesse Eisenberg were cast as the three leads. The original plotline had three strangers brought together by a car accident in the Hollywood Hills and the subsequent attack of a werewolf. The three characters were named Ellie Hudson, Vince Winston, and Jimmy Myers. With a budget of $38 million, Cursed commenced shooting in March 2003 in Los Angeles. The set used for the high school is Torrance High School, the same used for Sunnydale High on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and West Beverly High on Beverly Hills, 90210 and its spin-off 90210. Filming also occurred at Verdugo Hills High School. Special effects were shot in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. However, the film soon suffered numerous production and script issues and was postponed for over a year. While production was stalled, several cast members had to be replaced due to scheduling conflicts with other films. When the movie was rewritten and reshot, many cast members had been cut entirely, including Skeet Ulrich, Mandy Moore, Omar Epps, Illeana Douglas, Heather Langenkamp, Scott Foley, Robert Forster, and Corey Feldman. Some of them had even filmed scenes which were scrapped by director Wes Craven. In the film, Ellie works among the crew of The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, with Kilborn making a cameo appearance and Scott Baio, as himself, being booked to appear on the show. But by the time the film was released in February 2005, Kilborn had left the show and had been replaced with Craig Ferguson. Only about 90% of the original version was filmed, leaving the original ending unfilmed. Although, while filming the original version, producer Bob Weinstein told Wes Craven he was happy with the film, he later changed his opinion and ordered for the movie to be reshot with a new plot. After massive reshoots which included filming a new ending, Weinstein told Craven he didn't like the new ending, leading to another ending where Jake attacks Ellie and Jimmy in their home, despite some incoherence with the rest of the film. Rick Baker did the werewolf effects for the original version of the film, but once Bob Weinstein and Miramax ordered reshoots, all the scenes with Baker's effects were deleted and replaced by KNB. In the fall of 2004, Dimension cut the film to a PG-13 rating instead of the planned R rating. Speaking to the New York Post, Wes Craven commented, \\"The contract called for us to make an R-rated film. We did. It was a very difficult process. Then it was basically taken away from us and cut to PG-13 and ruined. It was two years of very difficult work and almost 100 days of shooting of various versions. Then at the very end, it was chopped up and the studio thought they could make more with a PG-13 movie, and trashed it ... I thought it was completely disrespectful, and it hurt them too, and it was like they shot themselves in the foot with a shotgun.\\" Jenny's death scene in the elevator was originally much gorier, her dead body shown with her belly ripped apart, but not even the R-rated DVD version included this scene. A picture of her mutilated body was, however, shown in a Fangoria article published before the film's release covering the infamously troubled production. In 2008, Wes Craven was quoted saying; \\"... the Cursed experience was so screwed up. I mean, that went on for two-and-a- half years of my life for a film that wasn't anything close to what it should have been. And another film that I was about to shoot having the plug pulled ‚Äì Pulse ‚Äì so it was like, I did learn from the Cursed experience not to do something for money. They said, 'We know you want to do another film, we'll pay you double.' And we were 10 days from shooting, and I said fine. But I ended up working two-and-a-half years for double my fee, but I could have done two-and-a-half movies, and done movies that were out there making money. In general, I think it's not worth it and part of the reason my phone hasn't rung is that that story is pretty well known.\\" In 2014, costar Judy Greer spoke of the film in an interview: \\"I don't know why that movie got so fucked up. I don't understand it. I thought the script was fine. Honest to god, I didn't get the big deal. I don't know who kept making them fuck with it. Then we shot the movie for, like, seven years. I think they said we had four movies worth of footage. It was so fun, but so weird. I don't get it. I couldn't figure it out.\\" In 2018, Christina Ricci also spoke briefly about the film in an interview: \\"It was one of those studio movies that just got horribly screwed up.\\"https://www.avclub.com/christina-ricci-on-sleeping-over-at-cher-s-and-the- impo-1826995324 In 2019, Jesse Eisenberg also give his thoughts about the troubled production and the movie: \\"The first movie was more interesting and provocative. I don‚Äôt know why it wasn‚Äôt working. Now that we know the behind- the-scenes of the Weinstein company, it makes sense as to why it was so chaotic.\\" About the troubled production he said: \\"They filmed 90% of the bigger budget version‚Ä¶the first movie was this very splashy thing. The second version was definitely cutting corners in a lot of different ways. And the plot? I thought it was so stupid. I thought the plot was so clich√©. They made us brother and sister? The things that they kept [from the original film] were little snippets. Like a car rolling down a hill. They kept that shot.‚Äù Eisenberg also talks about the reshoots: \\"The crazy part is that after we filmed the whole second version of the film, we had to go back for a third re- shoot which lasted about 20 days. That‚Äôs like the length of an independent movie. And then we had to go back a fourth time for like 10 days and they made shirts that said Cursed 4: Back for More.‚Äùhttps://bloody- disgusting.com/interviews/3589191/jesse-eisenberg-recalls-cursed/  Marketing  The taglines include \\"What doesn't kill you can make you stronger\\", \\"Have you ever felt like you're not human anymore?\\" and \\"The Evolution of the Specie.\\" Several film posters were released, some for abroad, such as the Swedish poster with the tagline \\"Vem kan du lita p√• vif fullm√•ne?\\" (\\"Whom can you trust during the full Moon?\\"); the unrated version's poster has a red color palette, rather than the standard American. A second American poster gives the title as Wes Craven's Cursed with the tagline \\"Living comes at a price.\\"  Soundtrack  Release In the United States, the film was originally to be released as an R-rated film with graphic violent scenes. However, the studio wished to have a more marketable PG-13 rating, and the film was edited and released as a PG-13 film. In Canada, the uncut version of the film was released theatrically and received a 14A in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario, a 14 in the Maritimes (after appeal) and a 13+ in Quebec. In British Columbia, the film was given an 18A and, after an unsuccessful appeal,Reconsideration Document for Cursed - British Columbia Film Classification Office the edited US version was submitted, 14A-rated, and released in British Columbia. =Home media= When released on DVD in the US on June 21, 2005, two versions were available: the original theatrical version (rated PG-13; 97 min.), and also an unrated version (99 min.) which contains the footage cut to obtain a PG-13 rating and runs approximately 2 minutes longer than the original release. The film received its Blu-ray release on September 11, 2012, in a double feature with another Wes Craven film, They. In Canada, Alliance Atlantis released the unrated (marketed as 'Uncensored') version only on DVD (as opposed to Dimension Home Video in the US) and the DVD cover was changed to match the original theatrical poster. Reception =Critical reception= The film was largely panned by critics, audiences, and Craven alike. It currently has a 17% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 96 reviews, with an average score of 3.47/10. The site consensus reads: \\"A predictable plot and cheesy special effects make Cursed a less-than- scary experience.\\" Metacritic reports a score of 31/100 based on 21 critics, indicating \\"Generally unfavorable reviews\\". The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"Cursed is a third-rate effort, with a weak script, cheap-looking effects and no genuine frights.\\" Film Threat stated, \\"Not that it doesn't make movie history. Until this past Friday, the worst werewolf film ever made was, hairy hands down, Mike Nichols' Wolf. Cursed now assumes that dubious distinction and someone is going to have to try very hard to wrestle it away.\\" Rafe Telsch of Cinema Blend, granting the movie 2 out of 5 stars, felt that \\"Cursed isn't a bad film, and actually takes a unique approach to modern day genre movies by styling itself as an older one... The film is a fun little romp in the werewolf world, although Cursed never really sets any rules for the creatures themselves, leaving itself open to keep cute faces like Ricci's uncovered by makeup, but leaving the audience unsatisfied that there aren't really many werewolves in this werewolf movie.\\" =Box office= Cursed opened theatrically on February 25, 2005, grossing $19,297,522 at the North American box office and $10,324,200 internationally for a total worldwide gross of $29,621,722 against a $38 million budget, making the film a box office bomb.

He had a string of hit singles in the mid-1950s. He died of an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 25. Life and career Alexander was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of a preacher, and grew up near LeMoyne-Owen College. He dropped out of high school to join the U.S. Navy. Alexander was reportedly AWOL for much of his duty. After he was discharged, he joined Adolph Duncan's Band as a pianist. Alexander played around Beale Street in Memphis. The network of local musicians became known as the Beale Streeters, which included B. B. King, Bobby Bland, Junior Parker, Earl Forrest, Roscoe Gordon. Initially, they weren't an official band, but at times there was a leader and they played on each other's records. In 1951, Ike Turner, who was a talent scout and producer for Modern Records, arranged for Alexander and other Beale Streeters to record for Modern in 1951. Alexander played piano on some of B.B. King's records for RPM Records and backed King during broadcasts at WDIA. When King departed for Los Angeles and the vocalist Bobby Bland left the group, Alexander took over vocal duties and he also took over King's radio show on WDIA. David James Mattis, program director at WDIA and founder of Duke Records, claimed he renamed Alexander Johnny Ace. \\"Johnny\\" for Johnny Ray and \\"Ace\\" for the Four Aces. However, Alexander's his younger brother, St. Clair Alexander, claimed that Alexander came up with the name Ace when Mattis changed his first name from John to Johnny. Ace signed to Duke in 1952, and released his first recording, \\"My Song\\", an urbane \\"heart ballad\\", which topped the R&B; chart for nine weeks beginning in September. He began heavy touring, often with Willie Mae \\"Big Mama\\" Thornton. In the next two years, he had eight hits in a row, including \\"Cross My Heart\\", \\"Please Forgive Me\\", \\"The Clock\\", \\"Yes, Baby\\", \\"Saving My Love for You\\" and \\"Never Let Me Go\\". After Ace had success as a solo artists, the Biharis brothers at Modern released the single \\"Mid Night Hours Journey\\" on their subsidiary label Flair Records in September 1953. The flip side was \\"Trouble and Me\\" by Earl Forrest. In November 1954, Ace ranked No. 16 on The Billboard 1954 Disk Jockey Poll for R&B; Favorite Artists. In December 1954, Ace was named the Most Programmed Artist of 1954, according to the results of a national poll of disc jockeys conducted by the U.S. trade weekly Cash Box.Warner, Jay (2006). On This Day in Black Music History. Hal Leonard. . Ace's recordings sold very well for those times. Early in 1955, Duke Records announced that three of his 1954 recordings, along with Thornton's \\"Hound Dog\\", had sold more than 1,750,000 copies.  Personal life  Ace met Lois Jean Palmer, a freshman at Booker T. Washington High School, in 1949. His parents did not know they were dating until she became pregnant. Ace and Palmer were married in Earle, Arkansas on July 17, 1950. She was sixteen and he was twenty-one. Their son, Glenn Alexander, was born later that year. Ace moved Palmer into his parents' home in Memphis. He was barred from the home for playing blues music, so he mostly took residence at the Mitchell Hotel, owned by Sunbeam Mitchell, in Memphis. Ace had another child with his wife, a daughter named Janet Alexander, but the couple were rarely together due to his womanizing lifestyle, and by 1953 he had abandoned his family. Death After touring for a year, Ace had been performing at the City Auditorium in Houston, Texas, on Christmas Day 1954. During a break between sets, he was playing with a .32-caliber revolver. Members of his band said he did this often, sometimes shooting at roadside signs from their car. It was widely reported that Ace killed himself playing Russian roulette. However, Big Mama Thornton's bass player, Curtis Tillman, who witnessed the event, said, \\"I will tell you exactly what happened! Johnny Ace had been drinking and he had this little pistol he was waving around the table and someone said ‚ÄòBe careful with that thing‚Ä¶‚Äô and he said ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs okay! Gun‚Äôs not loaded‚Ä¶ see?‚Äô and pointed it at himself with a smile on his face and ‚ÄòBang!‚Äô ‚Äî sad, sad thing. Big Mama ran out of the dressing room yelling ‚ÄòJohnny Ace just killed himself!'\\" Thornton said in a written statement (included in the book The Late Great Johnny Ace) that Ace had been playing with the gun but not playing Russian roulette. According to Thornton, Ace pointed the gun at his girlfriend and another woman who were sitting nearby but did not fire. He then pointed the gun toward himself, bragging that he knew which chamber was loaded. The gun went off, shooting him in the side of the head. According to his biographer Nick Tosches, Ace shot himself with a .32 pistol, not a .22, and it happened little more than an hour after he had bought a new 1955 Oldsmobile. Ace's funeral was held on January 2, 1955, at Clayborn Temple AME church in Memphis. It was attended by an estimated 5,000 people.Salem, James M. (2001).

His remains were buried at New Park Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. \\"Pledging My Love\\" was a posthumous R&B; number 1 hit for 10 weeks beginning February 12, 1955. As Billboard bluntly put it, Ace's death \\"created one of the biggest demands for a record that has occurred since the death of Hank Williams just over two years ago.\\" Thus Johnny Ace became the first act to reach the Billboard pop charts only after death.Casey Kasem, \\"American Top 40\\", 2 August 1986 His single recordings were compiled and released as The Johnny Ace Memorial Album. Legacy Rock-and-roll historian Harry Hepcat noted that \\"Johnny Ace was a crooner who sounded like Johnny Mathis with soul. ....Soon after the death of Johnny Ace, Varetta Dillard recorded \\"Johnny Has Gone\\" for Savoy Records in early 1955. She incorporated many of Ace's song titles in the lyrics. This was the first of the many teen tragedy records that were to follow in the later 50s and early 1960s.\\" In addition to Varetta Dillard's \\"Johnny Has Gone\\", at least four other tribute records to Johnny Ace were released in 1955: Frankie Ervin's \\"Johnny Ace's Last Letter\\"; The Rovers' \\"Salute To Johnny Ace\\"; Linda Hayes' \\"Why, Johnny, Why?\\"; and The Five Wings‚Äô \\"Johnny's Still Singing\\".https://www.allmusic.com/album/aces-wild-mw0002390084 Bob Dylan and Joan Baez performed \\"Never Let Me Go\\" on tour with the Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975. The same song would also be covered by Luther Vandross in 1993, as the title track to his eighth studio album. Elvis Presley recorded \\"Pledging My Love\\" in his last studio session, in 1976. The song appeared on the album Moody Blue in 1977. Paul Simon wrote and performed the song \\"The Late Great Johnny Ace\\" (1983), in which a boy, upon hearing of the death of Ace, orders a photograph of the deceased singer: \\"It came all the way from Texas / With a sad and simple face / And they signed it on the bottom / From the Late Great Johnny Ace.\\" The song develops a touching counterpoint with the death of two other Johnnies ‚Äì John Lennon and John F. Kennedy. Simon also performed \\"Pledging My Love\\" on his tour of Europe and North America in 2000. David Allan Coe covered \\"Pledging My Love\\", introducing the song with his own recollections of hearing the news of Ace's death. Ace is mentioned in \\"House Band in Hell\\", by Root Boy Slim, and in the song \\"Johnny Ace\\", by Dash Rip Rock. \\"Pledging My Love\\" was used in the 1973 film Mean Streets, directed by Martin Scorsese; the 1983 film Christine, directed by John Carpenter; the 1985 film Back to the Future, directed by Robert Zemeckis; and the 1992 film Bad Lieutenant, directed by Abel Ferrara. The Teen Queens' song \\"Eddie My Love\\", originally entitled \\"Johnny My Love\\", was written in memory of Ace. The Swiss singer Polo Hofer and the Schmetterband wrote the song \\"Johnny Ace\\" in 1985; it was released on the album Giggerig. Will Oldham noted Ace's death in the lyrics of his song \\"Let the Wires Ring\\", on his 2000 albbum Guarapero/Lost Blues 2. Dave Alvin's 2011 album, Eleven Eleven, contains the song \\"Johnny Ace Is Dead\\", about Ace's death. The Squirrel Nut Zippers' Christmas album, Christmas Caravan (1998), contains the song \\"A Johnny Ace Christmas\\", a love song about Ace killing himself on Christmas.

He was born in Vitry-le-Fran√ßois and received his musical training at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he won first prize in music history, and the Salzburg Mozarteum. He also earned a degree in mathematics at the Sorbonne. In 1953, he founded the Jean-Marie Leclair Instrumental Ensemble, which later became the Jean-Fran√ßois Paillard Chamber Orchestra in 1959. The ensemble has made recordings of much of the Baroque repertoire for Erato Records and has toured throughout Europe and the United States. It has also recorded with many leading French instrumentalists, including Maurice Andr√©, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Pierre Pierlot, Lily Laskine, Jacques Lancelot, Michel Arrignon. A 1968 recording by the orchestra of the \\"Canon and Gigue for 3 violins and basso continuo\\" by Johann Pachelbel, familiarly known as Pachelbel's Canon, nearly single-handedly brought the piece from obscurity to great renown. The recording was done in a more Romantic style, at a significantly slower tempo than it had been played at before, and contained obligato parts, written by Paillard, that are now closely associated with the piece. It was released on an Erato Records album, and was also included on a widely distributed album by mail-order label Musical Heritage Society album in 1968. The recording began to get significant attention in the United States, particularly in San Francisco, during the early 1970s. By the late 1970s various renditions of it were topping classical music charts in the U.S., including Paillard's own.Billboard Year-end Double Issue, December 24, 1977 The Paillard Chamber Orchestra's recording was also prominently featured in the soundtrack of the 1980 film Ordinary People.

The volume enclosed between the sides of the rotor and the rotor casing provide compression and expansion in a fashion similar to the more familiar Wankel engine, but the hinging at the edges allows the volume ratio to increase. Unlike vane pumps, in which vane extension is generally important and against which the pressure acts to generate the rotation, the Quasiturbine contour seals have a minimal extension and the rotation does not result from pressure against these seals. Patents for the Quasiturbine (in the most general AC concept with carriages) US Patent Quasiturbine AC (With Carriages) Dec. 1996US Patent Quasiturbine SC (Without Carriage) Feb. 2003 are held by the family of Gilles Saint-Hilaire of Qu√©bec. As well as an internal combustion engine, the Quasiturbine has been proposed as a possible pump design, and a possible Stirling engine.Quasiturbine Stirling engine Stirling engine idea on the Quasiturbine website. It has been demonstrated as a pneumatic engine using stored compressed air, and as a steam engine.Quasiturbine Low RPM High Torque Pressure Driven Turbine for Top Efficiency Power Modulation. Peers reviewed paper - Published in The Proceeding of Turbo Expo 2007 of the IGTI (International Gas Turbine Institute) and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers). Abstract and info There are at least four proposed designs: * Two-port with carriages, suitable for use as an internal combustion engine. * Four-port without carriages, suitable for use as a pneumatic engine or hydraulic engine, steam engine or pump. * Two-port without carriages, a conceptual design which is hoped to combine some of the advantages of the existing two- and four-port prototypes. * Another conceptual design using a fixed charge of gas, with no ports and without carriages, as a Stirling engine. (But not yet referring Malone engine in spite of similar function to Stirling engine) Two-port with carriages The earliest Quasiturbine design used a three-wheeled carriage (French chariot, hence avec chariots or AC for with carriages) to support each vertex of the rotor. The wheels of these four carriages, making twelve wheels in total, ran around the periphery of the engine chamber. A prototype of an internal combustion engine to this design was constructed, and enthusiastically reviewed in European Automotive Design magazine September, 1999. The prototype was turned by an external engine for 40 hours. However, ignition with fuel was never achieved. If it was attempted no results were ever released, and development work on this design was suspended. =Photo- detonation= The two-port design with carriages was proposed to make possible a new and superior mode of combustion, termed photo-detonation by the Quasiturbine inventors. This resembles detonation, as used in the Bourke engine, akin to knocking and pinging undesirable in common internal combustion engines. , no research has been published supporting this claim. A related idea that flame transfer would be possible through special ports is similarly unsupported. Four-port without carriages Quasiturbine QT-SC configured as a steam engine The second Quasiturbine design is greatly simplified to eliminate the carriages (French sans chariots or SC). At the same time, the ports were duplicated on the opposite side of the housing, thus converting the operation from four strokes per cycle to two and doubling the number of cycles per rotor revolution. This mechanism has been demonstrated running as a pneumatic engine using stored compressed air, and also as a steam engine. This is also the design proposed for use as a pump, and particularly as a supercharger. This design uses redesigned blades, longer than those for a similar sized housing of the first type owing to the absence of the carriages, and lacking the distinctive crown contour. Only the basic rotor geometry is common with the earlier design. A pneumatic engine of this design was demonstrated powering a go-kart in November 2004, and another powering a small car in September 2005, both vehicles using stored compressed air to power the engine. a pneumatic chain saw driven by an air hose from a conventional external compressor is under development. With a suitably redesigned housing to allow for thermal expansion, the same rotor design has been demonstrated as a steam engine. Another potential variation of this design uses the two sets of ports independently, one as an engine and the other as a pump, thus potentially integrating the functions of a pump and its driving motor in one shaftless unit. One restriction of this usage is that the two fluids must be similar; It would not be possible for example to drive an integrated air pump with hydraulic fluid, as the rotor design is significantly different. no prototype of this variation has been demonstrated. Two-port without carriages This third design combines aspects of the first two. this design is conceptual only. It has not been built, but is used for purposes of illustration. If built it would not support photo-detonation. Many other designs are possible within the patented Quasiturbine model, with or without carriages and with differing numbers of ports. , which design will be used for further work on the internal combustion version has not been announced.  History  Prof. J. Ignacio Mart√≠nez-Artajo (1907-1984) from Universidad Pontificia Comillas (Madrid, Spain) made sketches of an adaptative rotary compressor in the mid seventies, which led to the construction of a railway model missing of proper rotor dynamic solutions. Lately, research was conducted by Dr. Gilles Saint-Hilaire, a thermonuclear physicist, and members of his immediate family. The original objective was to make a turbo-shaft turbine engine where the compressor portion and the power portion would be in the same plane. In order to achieve this they had to disconnect the blades from the main shaft, chain them around in such a way that a single rotor acts as a compressor for a quarter turn and as an engine for the following quarter of a turn. The general concept of the Quasiturbine engine was first patented in 1996. Small pneumatic and steam units are available from the patent holders for sale or hire for research, academic training and industrial demonstration, as is a book (largely in French) describing the concepts and development of the design. Demonstrations have been undertaken on an Air Gokart in 2004, on ‚ÄúAPUQ Air Car‚Äù in 2005, on the University of Connecticut ‚ÄúBrash Steam Car‚Äù in 2010, and other products (Chainsaw and generator). The patent holders have announced that they intend to make similar internal combustion prototypes available for demonstration.

Known as Raley Field from 2000 to 2019, the facility was built on the site of old warehouses and rail yards in West Sacramento, California, across the Sacramento River from the California State Capitol. It is directly adjacent to downtown Sacramento. History The $46.5 million stadium was built in eight-and-a-half months, but extended periods of bad weather forced the River Cats on a season-opening one month-long road trip, as completion was delayed 45 days. The completion time however was estimated to be about two years. The home opener was played on May 15, 2000. The stadium is one of the few professional sports facilities in the nation built without a public sector contribution. Although constructed using bonds financed by the River City Stadium Financing Authority, bond payments are paid from ticket, concession, advertising, and other revenues, not taxes. Because the $46.5 million project cost was too large for the host city to finance, Christopher Cabaldon, in his first term as Mayor of West Sacramento, recruited Sacramento County and Yolo County to join his city in a joint-powers agency which became the stadium financing authority. Because of the success of the stadium, its private revenue sources have been more than sufficient to repay the construction bonds and build a bond reserve. The stadium has 10,624 permanent seats and grass berms in both right and left field for a total capacity of 14,014. Its original capacity was 14,611 and was decreased to 14,414 in 2005 with the addition of a party deck. It further decreased in 2010 with the opening of the Diamond Club behind home plate. The stadium has 2,798 club seats and 750 seats in 36 suites. The naming rights for the facility were sold to Raley's, a regional chain of supermarkets which is also based in West Sacramento, for $15 million over 20 years. The stadium was not designed with expansion in mind; therefore, if a major league ballclub ever moved to Sacramento there would be significant work required. The ballpark hosted the 2005 Triple-A All-Star Game in which the Pacific Coast League All-Stars defeated the International League All-Stars, 11‚Äì5. There was discussion of the Sacramento Mountain Lions, an American football team in the United Football League, using the field during the 2012 season. A final agreement to this effect was announced on August 6, 2012. The UFL, including the Mountain Lions, abruptly shut down operations in the middle of the 2012 season. On July 18, 2013, Raley Field hosted a soccer match, a friendly featuring Mexican side Dorados de Sinaloa and Premier League side Norwich City F.C. The game finished 3-0 to Norwich, with goals from Luciano Becchio, Anthony Pilkington and Josh Murphy. The match's attendance was 14,014. As part of the Golden State Hockey Rush, Raley Field hosted a minor league hockey game between the Stockton Heat and the Bakersfield Condors of the American Hockey League on December 18, 2015. The ballpark was renamed Sutter Health Park before the 2020 season as part of a naming rights agreement with Sacramento- based Sutter Health.

Acharius spent the remainder of his life in Vadstena, where he died of a stroke while in his household garden examining a Spanish collection of lichens on 14 August 1819, at the age of 61.  Work in lichenology  leftAcharius belonged to the younger generations of Swedish botanists who continued what Linnaeus had left undone; classifying all living organisms. Acharius began the taxonomic classification of Lichenes and during his lifetime he classified over 3300 species of lichen separated into 40 different genera.Anderberg, Arne. ‚ÄúErik Acharius, the Father of Lichenology.‚Äù Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet - Startsida, Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, 7 Nov. 2014, www.nrm.se/en/forskningochsamlingar/botanik/botaniskhistoria/erikacharius.310.html. At the time of Linnaeus's death all lichens were grouped into a single genus, thus Acharius was the first to expand lichen classification into the multi- divisional group of organisms it is known to be today.Fr√∂d√©n, Patrik. ‚ÄúLichenology in Lund ‚Äì an Historical Overview  The Lichenologist.‚Äù Cambridge Core, Cambridge University Press, 6 Aug. 2009, www.cambridge.org/core/journals/lichenologist/article/lichenology-in-lund-an- historical-overview/12AD4A9CCFD0292CC73E7C3A17B8964D. His first publication was Lichenographiae Suecia prodromus, published in 1798, which detailed all known lichen species found in Sweden. This was the first published work to detail lichens using binomial nomenclature and expand their classification beyond a single genus. While composing Lichenographiae Suecia prodromus, Acharuis began communicating with Olof Swartz, another Linnaean disciple, and from 1780 to 1815 they sent nearly 350 letters to each other. Swartz is believed by many historians to have heavily influenced the development of Acharuis's classification system.‚ÄúErik Acharius, Olof Swartz and the Evolution of Generic Concepts in Lichenology  Archives of Natural History.‚Äù International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing, www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/anh.1981.017. Additionally, Swartz introduced Acharuis to many other Swedish naturalists as also several important international figures such as James Edward Smith, the head of the Linnean Society. This exposure aided Acharuis in spreading his new findings on lichens to an international audience. After publishing his first work, he sent a copy to James Edward Smith who, in response, inducted Acharuis as a foreign member of the Linnean Society.‚ÄúAcharius' Lichenographi√¶ Sueci√¶ Prodromus.‚Äù Uppsala University Library, Uppsala University, Sweden, www.ub.uu.se/finding- your-way-in-the-collections/selections-of-special-items-and- collections/acharius/.

Legacy  Acharuis's international reputation influence many new lichenologist from all over Europe. In 1804 Friedrich Weber (1781-1823) and Daniel Matthias Heinrich Mohr (1780-1808), two German naturalists, published Naturhistorische Reise durch einen Theil Schwedens which heavily featured his work on lichens and also included four illustrations by Acharuis.Weber, Fried, and Dan Matth. Heinr. Mohr. Naturhistorische Reise Durch Einen Theil Schwedens. 1804. Furthermore, William Borrer who pioneered lichenology in Britain (and is often called the father of British lichenology) was heavily influence by Acharius's specimens and publications received by the Linnean society in London.

The first well at Jebel Fahud was completed at 12,235 feet in May 1957. Unfortunately, it was a dry hole except for a very small quantity of gas and oil. Three of the PDO partners decided to withdraw from the Omani concession, leaving Shell (85%) and Partex (15%) to take it over and resume exploration. Only a few hundred yards from the original test well site, a second test well was sunk at Fahud and, in 1964, found oil in commercial quantities. Today, Fahud is the central base of PDO's operations in the interior of Oman; the company's main offices are in Mina Al Fahal in Muscat.

Banyamulenge is a term historically referring to mountains concentrated on the High Plateau of South Kivu, in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to the Burundi-Congo-Rwanda border. In the late 1990s, Ren√© Lemarchand stated that the main ethnic groups claimed the Banyamulenge numbered around 50,000 to 70,000.Lemarchand, 10 G√©rard Prunier quotes around 60,000‚Äì80,000, a figure of about 3‚Äì4 percent of the total provincial population.Lemarchand states the figure of 400,000 given by Joseph Mutambo [Les Banyamulenges, (Limete: L'imprimerie M√©diaspaul de Kinshasa, 1997), 26 ] is \\"grossly exaggerated\\". Lemarchand, 10 Lemarchand notes that the group represents \\"a rather unique case of ethnogenesis\\". The Banyamulenge of South Kivu are culturally and socially distinct from the Tutsi of North Kivu. Most Banyamulenge speak Kinyamulenge which is a mixture of kinyarwanda and kirundi. The ambiguous political and social position of the Banyamulenge has been a point of contention in the province. The Banyamulenge played a key role in tensions during the run-up to the First Congo War in 1996‚Äì7 and Second Congo War of 1998‚Äì2003. The war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo caused more than 6 million lives, with casualties continuing in North Kivu and South Kivu.  Origins and early political status  Compared to the history of the Rwandophones in North Kivu, composed of Hutu and Tutsi, the history of Banyamulenge is relatively straightforward. The Banyarwanda/banyamulenge may have migrated from the Rwanda area in the seventeenth century.Historian Alexis Kagame claims that soldiers under Mwami Kigeli II of Rwanda (1648‚Äì1672) settled across the Ruzizi River, but Prunier asserts that \\"Kagame has a tendency to exaggerate the power of the old Rwanda kingdom.\\" Prunier, 51 & 381 But the first significant recorded influx of Banyarwanda into South Kivu is dated to the 1880s.Prunier, 51Lemarchand notes that the pre-colonial arrival of the Tutsi in the Kivus is generally agreed to among historians, but is \\"vehemently contested, however, by many Congolese intellectuals.\\" Lemarchand, 10. Two reasons are given for their migration: the migrants were composed of Tutsi trying to avoid the increasingly high taxes imposed by Mwami Rwabugiri of the Kingdom of Rwanda. Secondly, the group was fleeing the violent war of succession that erupted in 1895 after the death of Rwabugiri.Mamdani, 250 This group was mostly Tutsi and their Hutu abagaragu (clients), who had been icyihuture (turned Tutsi), which negated interethnic tension. They settled above the Ruzizi Plain on the Itombwe Plateau. The plateau, which reached an altitude of 3000 meters, could not support large-scale agriculture, but allowed cattle grazing. Banyarwanda migrants continued to arrive, particularly as labour migrants during the colonial period. The Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga recruited more than 7000 workers from 1925 to 1929. From the 1930s, Congolese Banyarwanda immigrants continued coming in search of work, with a major influx of Tutsi refugees in 1959‚Äì1960 following the \\"Social Revolution\\" led by Hutu Gr√©goire Kayibanda. While the early migrants lived primarily as pastoralists in the high plains, colonial labour migrants moved to urban areas. Refugees were placed in refugee camps.Mamdani, 247‚Äì248 In 1924, the pastoralists received permission from colonial authorities to occupy a high plateau further south. The groups received further immigrants during the anti- Tutsi persecutions in 1959, 1964 and 1973.Prunier, 51‚Äì52 Many Banyamulenge initially joined the Simba Rebellion of 1964‚Äì5, but switched sides when rebels, fleeing Jean Schramme's mercenaries and government troops, came onto the plateau and began killing the Banyarwanda's cattle for food. The Tutsi rose up, accepting weapons from the pro-Mobutu forces and assisting in the defeat of the remaining rebels. Because many of the rebels killed were from the neighbouring Bembe people, this incident created a lasting source of intra-group tension. The government rewarded the Banyamulenge efforts on its behalf by appointing individuals to high positions in the capital Bukavu, while their children were increasingly sent to missionary schools. Starting at this time, Lemarchand asserts, \\"From a rural, isolated, backward community, the Banyamulenge would soon become increasingly aware of themselves as a political force.\\" After the war, the group took advantage of a favourable political environment to expand their territory. Some moved south towards Moba port and Kalemi, while others moved onto the Ruzizi plain, where a few became chiefs among the Barundi through gifts of cattle. Still others went to work in the Bukavu, the provincial capital, or Uvira, a town experiencing a gold rush economic boom. These urban dwellers could make a fair living selling meat and milk from their herds to the gold diggers, though the group lacked the political connections to Kinshasa and the large educated class which was possessed by the North Kivu Banyarwanda.Prunier, 52 The pastoralists were located within three territoires: Mwenga, inhabited by the Lega people; Fizi of the Bembe people; and Uvira, inhabited by the Vira people, Bafuliro and Barundi.Mamdani, 248 The term \\"Banyamulenge\\" translates literally as \\"people of Mulenge\\", a groupement on the Itombwe plateau.Mamdani, 248‚Äì249 They chose the name \\"Banyamulenge\\" in the early 1970s to avoid being called \\"Banyarwanda\\" and seen as foreigners. Ethnic tensions against the Tutsi rose following the end of the colonial period, as well as during the 1972 mass killing of Hutu in Burundi. In response the Tutsi appear to have attempted to distance themselves from their ethnicity as Rwandans and lay claim to a territorial identity as residents of Mulenge. As they moved, they continued this practice. Some Tutsi Banyarwanda in South Kivu call themselves the Banya-tulambo and Banya- minembwe, after the places they were located.  Political tensions (1971‚Äì1992)  After 1971, such practices were considered increasingly more controversial. The 1971 Citizenship Decree by President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to the Banyarwanda who had arrived as refugees from 1959 to 1963. However, some leaders, such as Chief of Staff Barth√©l√©my Bisengimana, were concerned that this change was an alarming sign of the growing influence of the Banyarwanda in the administration.Mamdani, 252 In 1976, the word \\"Banyamulenge\\" first came into wide usage after Gisaro Muhazo, a South Kivutian minister of parliament, began an initiative to reclassify the Banyamulenge of Mwenga, Fizi, and Uvira into a single administrative entity. Muhazo's attempt failed, but the term he introduced remained. Over decades, it became used as a catchall label for the Kivutian Tutsi. In reaction to the apparently growing influence of the Banyamulenge, the majority ethnicities, particularly the Nande and Hunde of North Kivu, focused on dominating the 1977 legislative elections. Once accomplished, they passed the 1981 Citizenship Bill, stating that only people who could prove descent from someone resident in Congo in 1885 would qualify for citizenship. From the perspective of the \\"indigenous\\" ethnicities, such as the Bafuliro, the name \\"Banyamulenge\\" was a claim to indigeneity in Mulenge, but the Bafuliro themselves claimed \\"ownership\\" of this area. However, the bill proved difficult to implement by the time of the 1985 provincial assembly elections, so the \\"indigenous\\" Kivutian majority came up with an ad hoc measure: Banyarwanda were allowed vote in elections, but not to run for political office. This appeared to aggravate the situation, as those Banyarwanda who qualified as citizens under the 1981 law still found their political rights curtailed. Some Banyarwanda, particularly Tutsi, smashed ballot boxes in protest.Mamdani, 243‚Äì245 Others formed Umoja, an organisation of all Congolese Banyarwanda. However, the increasingly tensions within the Banyarwanda led to the division of the organisation into two Tutsi and Hutu groups in 1988. The 1991 Sovereign National Conference (CNS) was a sign of the increasing coherence of the anti- Mobutu forces and came as the Congolese Banyarwanda were in a state of heightened tension. Following the beginning of the Rwandan Civil War in 1990, many young Tutsi men in Kivu decided to cross the border to join the Tutsi- dominated rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in its fight against the Hutu- dominated Rwandan government. In response, the Mobutu government implemented Mission d'Identification de Za√Ørois au Kivu to identify non-Zairean Banyarwanda, using the end of the Berlin Conference as the division point. Many Banyarwanda whose families had come as colonial labourers were classified as aliens, resulting in yet more youth joining the RPF. The overall effect of the CNS was to strengthen the tendency of \\"indigenous\\" Congolese to differentiate between Tutsi from Hutu, and lump together all Tutsi Banyarwanda as \\"Banyamulenge\\". It also underlined the fragility of their political position to the Banyamulenge. Within the Banyarwanda in the Kivus, the Hutu began defining themselves as \\"indigenous\\" in comparison to the Tutsis, who were increasingly seen as owing their allegiance to the foreign groups.Mamdani, 245‚Äì247  Conflict (1993‚Äì1998)  In 1993, the issue of land and indigenous claims in the Kivus erupted into bloody conflict. Hutu, and some Tutsi, landlords began buying the lands of poor Hutu and Bahunde of the Wanyanga chiefdom in Masisi, North Kivu. After being displaced, one thousand people went to Walikale, demanding the right to elect their own ethnic leaders. The Banyanga, insisting that only \\"indigenous people\\" could claim this customary right, began fighting with the Hutu. The one thousand returned to Masisi, where the Hutu landlords, and Banyarwanda in general, supported the claim of Banyarwanda to \\"indigenous\\" rights. The government sent in the Division Sp√©ciale Pr√©sidentielle (DSP) and Guard Civile to restore order. Ill- supplied, the security forces were forced to live off the local population: the DSP off the rich Hutu and the Guard Civile off the Bahunde and ordinary Hutu. The DSP appeared to be protecting the rights of the \\"non-indigenous\\" (primarily Hutu) against the \\"indigenous\\" (primarily Bahunde), sparking outrage and increasing the scope of the conflict. One estimate is that between 10,000 and 20,000 people were killed; another 200,000 people were forced to flee their homes.Mamdani, pp. 252‚Äì253 In late 1993, about 50,000 Burundian refugees from the Burundi Civil War began streaming into primarily South Kivu. They were followed the next year by almost one million mostly Hutu refugees from the Rwandan genocide, creating the Great Lakes refugee crisis. The Hutu government responsible for the genocide came with the refugees; they turned the camps into armed bases from which they could launch attacks against the newly victorious RPF government in Rwanda. The influx of refugees dramatically changed the situation of the Banyamulenge. The Congolese Tutsi in North Kivu were threatened by the new armed Hutu camps, while the newly established Tutsi government in Rwanda gave them a safe place to go. Their peril was underlined by a commission led by Mambweni Vangu, who declared that all Banyarwanda were refugees and must return to Rwanda. In April 1995, Anzuluni Mbembe, the co- speaker of the Parliament of Congo, signed a resolution stating that all Banyamulenge were recent refugees (regardless of how long they had lived in the Congo) and providing a list of Banyamulenge who would be expelled from the country. Between March and May 1996, the remaining Tutsi in Masisi and Rutshuru were identified and expelled into refugee camps in Gisenyi. The Bahunde, forced out by the Hutu, also took refuge there.Mamdani, 253‚Äì255 The situation in South Kivu took longer to develop. Once the 1994 refugees arrived, local authorities began appropriating Banyamulenge-owned property in the valley with the support of Mbembe. Threatened by both the armed Hutus to the north and a Congolese army appropriating property and land, the Banyamulenge of South Kivu sought cross-border training and supply of arms from the RPF. As threats proliferated, each Native Authority formed its own militia. Finally, in November 1996, the RPF-backed Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), which the Banyamulenge militias joined, crossed the border and dismantled the camps, before continuing on to Kinshasa and overthrowing Mobutu.Mamdani, 255‚Äì259 The ranks of the AFDL were composed in large part by Banyamulenge, who filled most of the administrative positions in South Kivu after the fall of Bukavu.Lemarchand, 10‚Äì11 As documented in the DRC Mapping Exercise Report by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the success of the invasion led to revenge killings by the Tutsi Banyarwanda against their opponents. Perhaps six thousand Hutu were purged in the week following the AFDL capture of the town. It was worse in South Kivu, as Banyamulenge settled local scores and RPF soldiers appeared to conflate the g√©nocidaires with the Hutu with the \\"indigenous\\" Congolese. One intellectual in Bukavu who was otherwise sympathetic to the Banyamulenge claim to citizenship stated: > The Banyamulenge conquered their rights by arms but the rift between them > and the local population has grown. The attitude of the Tutsi > soldiers‚Äîduring and after the war has made them more detested by the > population due to the killings, torture. For example, they will go into the > village, raid all the cattle, tell the population‚Äîsince when have you > learned to keep cattle; we are cattle; we know cattle. In Bukavu, they went > into and stole from houses. Not so much in Goma. The result is the > population is increasingly getting concerned over the question of the Tutsi > presence.Mamdani, 259‚Äì260  Second Congo War (1998‚Äì2003)  Mixed group of Banyamulenge and Bafuliru repairing a road between Lemera and Mulenge, South Kivu, ca. 2003 The situation became more polarised with the beginning of the Second Congo War in 1998. Those who had carried out the massacres of Hutu became part of the ruling military forces in the Kivus. Meanwhile, the Congolese government of Laurent Kabila urged the \\"indigenous\\" population to fight not only the invading RPA ( Rwandan Patriotic Army ), but also the Congolese Tutsi civilians, the mostly affected being Banyamulenge. Matching actions to words, Kabila armed \\"indigenous\\" militias Mai-Mai and Congolese Hutu militias, as well as the G√©nocidaires (those who carried out mass killings during and after the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, in which close to a million Rwandans, primarily Tutsis, were murdered by their Hutu neighbors.) in response to the RPF's supplying arms to the Banyamulenge.Mamdani, 260‚Äì261 The two Mai-Mai groups most active against the Banyamulenge were the Babembe and Balega militias. The various Banyamulenge militias and the Rwandan government forces became separate because of disagreements over motives of the uprising after the creation of RCD-Goma. In early 2002, extensive fighting took place on the high plateau of South Kivu after Commandant Patrick Masunzu, then a Tutsi officer in the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma) rebel movement, gathered Banyamulenge support in an uprising against the RCD-Goma leadership.Responses to Information Requests (RIRs): \\"Current treatment of the Banyamulenge people in the Democratic Republic of Congo\\" , Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, UN High Commission on Refugees, June 2003 By 2000, the Banyamulenge were hemmed into the high plateau by Congolese Mai-Mai, the Burundian Forces for the Defense of Democracy, and the Rwandan Hutu Arm√©e de Lib√©ration du Rwanda (ALiR). They were unable to carry out basic economic activities without the security provided through the RCD-Goma. Numerous families fled to the relative safety of the Burundian capital of Bujumbura. Nevertheless, Banyamulenge made up much of the RCD military wing, the Arm√©e Nationale Congolaise (ANC), and controlled the towns of Fizi, Uvira, and Minembwe, which was recently declared a \\"commune\\" among many others in 2018. In August 2004, 166 Banyamulenge refugees were massacred at a refugee camp in Gatumba, Burundi by a force composed mostly of National Liberation Front rebels.See , Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper, September 2004 Vice-President Azarias Ruberwa, a Munyamulenge, suspended his participation in the transitional government for one week in protest, before being persuaded to return to Kinshasa by South African pressure.  M-23 War and present (2012‚Äì2019)  The majority of Banyamulenge were opposed to the M-23 Rebel Movement. This was largely due to the fact that this rebel movement was supported by Rwanda. Despite the fact that the majority of Banyamulenge was opposed to Rwanda's support of the rebellious M-23 led by Banyamasisi, there is a large number of Banyamulenge residing in Rwanda as refugees or Rwandan citizens and benefiting from the Tutsi-led government protection in Rwanda. Some of them occupy government posts and others can be found in lucrative private sectors while others seek residence as refugees and benefit from the US government resettlement program to relocate to the United States where a florishing Banyamulenge diaspora currently live. In (DRC), the Banyamulenge have been part of the elite community in politics and the military while benefiting from Kabila‚Äôs inner circle. This has led to increased tensions with local communities all over the country where proponents argue they receive government preferential treatment they do not deserve. This view is largely held by other tribes in South Kivu who have always maintained that they are more Rwandan (Tutsi) than they are Congolese. It remains a question of interest as to how they will be treated by the newly elected government under the leadership of president F√©lix Tshisekedi, as they have, in one way or the other, been fairly treated and protected under the leadership of Joseph Kabila. Congolese identify themselves based on their territories. For example, Bembe or Lega tribe identify themselves based on the following territories including Itombwe, Lulenge, Ngandja, Tanganyika and M'tambala. In each territories the occupant of the land are well-known regardless of its inhabitancy. Though some part of Sud Kivu is inhabited, the dwellers of the land knows well their territories and which land belonging to which tribe. In recent years, tensions over the identity of the Banyamulenge and their claims to a newly established district/\\"commune\\" (Minembwe) have created a new cycle of regional political and military disagreements which have led to new ethnic clashes, with a number of foreign armed groups sowing seeds of division for their military and political gains. In late 2019, due to rising ethnic tensions in South Kivu, several high-ranking national political and military leaders journeyed to Minembwe as an attempt to appease ethnic tensions in the region. In the diaspora, more especially in North America and European Union, a movement protesting against violence towards Banyamulenge was created using social media and international broadcasting channels reported on several demonstrations in the United States and Canada. Despite all this violence, Banyamulenge have resorted to peaceful strategies to resolve these problems. On January 6, the Banyamulenge community endorsed a judicial inquiry/mission to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for crimes committed in Minembwe.

Biography Edward G. Acheson House in Monongahela Historical marker for the birthplace of Edward Acheson in Washington, Pennsylvania Acheson (1856‚Äì1931) was raised in the coal fields of southwestern Pennsylvania. Acheson attended the Bellefonte Academy for three years, 1870‚Äì72; this being the totality of his formal education. Bellefonte Academy: Notable Alumni He left school at the age of 16 to help support his family after his father died, and worked as a surveying assistant for the Pittsburgh Southern Railroad. He devoted his evenings to scientific pursuits‚Äîprimarily electrical experiments. In 1880 he had the temerity to attempt to sell a battery of his own invention to Thomas Edison and wound up being hired. Edison put him to work on September 12, 1880 at his Menlo Park, New Jersey laboratory under John Kruesi. Acheson experimented on making a conducting carbon that Edison could use in his electric light bulbs. In 1881 he was sent to the International Exposition of Electricity in Paris, as part of the team led by Charles Batchelor, and he remained in Europe in 1882 to install demonstrations of the Edison system of electrical lighting in Antwerp City Hall in Belgium and in La Scala in Milan,Anna Guagnini, \\"A Bold Leap into Electric Light: The Creation of the Societ√† Italiana Edison, 1880‚Äì1886\\", History of Technology, 32: special issue Italian Technology from the Renaissance to the Twentieth Century, edited by Anna Guagnini and Luca Mol√† (2014), p. 160. among other public places. In 1884, Acheson left Edison and became supervisor at a plant competing to manufacture electric lamps. He began working on the development of methods to produce artificial diamond in an electric furnace. After heating a mixture of clay and coke in an iron bowl with a carbon arc light he found shiny, hexagonal crystals (silicon carbide) attached to the carbon electrode. He called it carborundum. In 1891 Acheson built an electricity plant in Port Huron at the suggestion of Edison and used the electricity to experiment with carborundum. On February 28, 1893, he received a patent on this highly effective abrasive although a 1900 decision gave \\"priority broadly\\" to the Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company \\"for reducing ores and other substances by the incandescent method\\". Acheson received 70 patents relating to abrasives, graphite products, reduction of oxides, and refractories. He was awarded the first Acheson Award, named in his honour, by the Electrochemical Society in 1931. He died on July 6, 1931, in New York City. =Recognition= In 1953, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker outside his home, noting the historic importance of his achievements. In 1997, Acheson was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.National Inventors Hall of Fame His house, the Edward G. Acheson House in Monongahela, Pennsylvania is a National Historic Landmark. As one of The Electrochemical Society's most prestigious members, the organization presents an award in his name every two years to distinguish contributions to the advancement of any of the objects, purposes, or activities of the Society.

She proved, in 1929, that the benzene ring is flat by using X-ray diffraction methods to elucidate the structure of hexamethylbenzene. She was the first to use Fourier spectral methods while solving the structure of hexachlorobenzene in 1931. During her career she attained several firsts for female scientists, including being one of the first two women elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1945 (along with Marjory Stephenson), first woman tenured professor at University College London, first woman president of the International Union of Crystallography, and first woman president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Or see alternative source. An overview of the scope and content of the collection of Lonsdale's papers that are kept at University College London. This article first appeared in The Irish Times, 13 December 2001. Early life and education She was born Kathleen Yardley at Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland, the tenth child of Harry Yardley, the town postmaster, and Jessie Cameron. Her family moved to Seven Kings, Essex, England, when she was five years old. She studied at Woodford County High School for Girls, then transferred to Ilford County High School for Boys to study mathematics and science, because the girls' school did not offer these subjects. She earned her Bachelor of Science degree from Bedford College for Women in 1922, graduating in physics with an MSc from University College London in 1924. Career and research In 1924 she joined the crystallography research team headed by William Henry Bragg at the Royal Institution. From 1929 to 1934, she started a family and largely stayed at home while continuing her work calculating structure factors. In 1934, Lonsdale returned to work with Bragg at the Royal Institution as a researcher. She was awarded a DSc from University College London in 1936 while at the Royal Institution. In addition to discovering the structure of benzene and hexachlorobenzene, Lonsdale worked on the synthesis of diamonds. She was a pioneer in the use of X-rays to study crystals. Lonsdale was one of the first two women elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1945 (the other was the biochemist Marjory Stephenson). In 1949 Lonsdale was appointed professor of chemistry and head of the Department of Crystallography at University College London. She was the first tenured woman professor at that college, a position she held until 1968 when she was named Professor Emeritus. =Selected publications= *Simplified Structure Factor and Electron Density Formulae for the 230 Space Groups of Mathematical Crystallography, G.

Personal life After beginning her research career, in 1927 Yardley married Thomas Jackson Lonsdale. They had three children ‚Äì Jane, Nancy, and Stephen. Stephen became a medical doctor and worked for several years in Nyasaland (now Malawi). =Pacifism= Though she had been brought up in the Baptist denomination as a child, Kathleen Lonsdale became a Quaker in 1935, simultaneously with her husband. Already committed pacifists, both were attracted to Quakerism for this reason. She was a Sponsor of the Peace Pledge Union. Pamphlet written by Kathleen Lonsdale on Prison Reform in 1943 She served a month in Holloway prison during the Second World War because she refused to register for civil defence duties, or to pay a fine for refusing to register. During this time she experienced a range of issues which would eventually result in Lonsdale becoming a prison reform activist and she joined the Howard League for Penal Reform. > \\"What I was not prepared for was the general insanity of an administrative > system in which lip service is paid to the idea of segregation and the ideal > of reform, when in practice the opportunities for contamination and > infection are innumerable, and those responsible for re-education > practically nil\\" In 1953, at the annual meeting of the British Quakers, she delivered the keynote Swarthmore Lecture, under the title Removing the Causes of War.

He warned President Johnson in 1966 that a tax increase was needed to finance the escalation of the war in Vietnam and the increased social welfare spending that Johnson was undertaking. Johnson did not ask for a tax increase, and economists, including Paul Samuelson, believed this was the cause of the inflation of the 1970s. Ackley was the author of the popular graduate-level textbook Macroeconomic Theory, which was translated into several languages and remained the standard advanced text during the 1960s and early 1970s.

The name for this alludes to the old Hollywood practice of \\"the star system\\". As an example, Shunsaku Ban (a.k.a. Shunsuke Ban), the detective in Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis might also turn up again as Astro Boy's teacher in Astro Boy. Tezuka joked about how much they were paid and based them on famous western actors in his time. (Note that because numerous kanji have the same pronunciations in Japanese, characters' names are usually phonetically identical but written with different kanji from story to story.) A partial list of characters =Osamu Tezuka himself= Osamu Tezuka himself makes frequent appearances, usually just as an in-joke, in nearly all of his works. He can be recognized by his round spotted nose and round glasses and sometimes wears a beret. In the collected Astro Boy volumes, he often introduces stories, and dispense trivia. He is a major character in the manga Vampire. Tezuka went so far as to play the role himself in the 1968 TV adaptation of the series. He also makes frequent appearances in the Black Jack anime, in which, as a doctor, he is a former classmate of Black Jack's. =Others= * Acetylene, Lamp: Also known as Drake (or Torch in the second series). A tall, middle-aged man with a thin nose, large forehead, wide frowny eyes and often a small mustache with big glasses. He has a \\"notch\\" on the back of his head. A running gag throughout Tezuka's work show that a lit candle will stand upright if placed in the notch. Tezuka based the character on a classmate. He appeared regularly in Astro Boy and in Tezuka's Adolf, Black Jack (manga) and in Phoenix. He was the president's secretary in Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis in which the candle appears on his head when he is shot. The candle is a plot point in the game Astro Boy: Omega Factor. He also appeared in Bagi, the Monster of Mighty Nature, and cameos in Jungle Emperor Leo. * Afill * Amazing Three, The * Ambassador Magma: A giant humanoid who can transform into a rocketship. With this series, Tezuka pioneered the \\"transformers\\" concept. * Atlas * Atom (Astro Boy): A principal \\"actor\\". He is shown in the famous manga and assorted versions of the anime as a child robot, usually wearing shorts (which are actually part of his body), with identified by his trademark, two pointy \\"cowlicks\\" on the front and back of his head. In the manga, his good nature and incorruptible heart, combined with an array of powers, put him on a quest to protect robots and humans from villainous conquerors and alien invaders. He made other appearances in other manga including Black Jack's, in which he plays a major role in at least one story (Volume 22 of the English manga release by Dark Horse of Astro Boy) and in the anime Undersea Super Train: Marine Express, in which he is called \\"Adam\\". Astro resembles the wooden boy Pinocchio. * Ban, Shunsaku or Shunsuke Ban: A bald, portly, middle- aged man with alarge moustache. He is an often comical and grumpy yet good- natured. 42 years old, as mentioned in one of the manga. His facial hair earns him the nickname Higeoyaji (\\"moustache old man\\"). In the 1960s English version of the animated Astro Boy, his name was private detective Victor Pompous, then Percival Pompous. Perhaps because his character was appearing in another animated series based on Tezuka's manga at the time, in the 1980s English animated Astro Boy changed his name to Albert Duncan, aka Daddy Walrus. His typical role is that of a detective in other Tezuka materials, with sometimes a nephew/assistant named Ken'ichi (Ken or Kennedy in English versions of the Astro Boy TV series). The 1980s color remake (as well as the original manga) had him appear as Astro Boy's teacher, then as a detective. In the 2003 Astro Boy redeux, he is called Wally Kisaragi, and in the English-language manga, his \\"Higeoyaji\\" nickname is translated as \\"Mustachio\\". He is featured as either a regular character or a guest star in any of a number of Tezuka works. Shunsaku Ban is often cast as some sort of adventurer, usually an amateur or professional private investigator. His trademark characteristic is to confront danger with a comical wild-eyed panic, then after a moment recapture his composure and vigorously attack the threat. * Big X * Biwamaru: A tall, thin bald man; he is completely blind and his eyes are white. His left eye is larger than his right. In Dororo, he is a travelling monk who crosses paths with Hyakkimaru from time to time. In Black Jack, he is a wandering acupuncturist and a rival to Black Jack. He also appears as the Buddhist Priest Tenran in Duke Goblin. * Black Garon * Black Jack- Black Jack, a cold- natured, eerie, yet kindhearted and ingenious surgeon is one of Tezuka's dearest creations, despite the fact that in the present day he receives very little credit compared to his rival Astro Boy. Black Jack is, according to Tezuka, his alter ego. Black Jack refuses to get a medical licence, due to the corruption within medicine practices, and may run into the legal forces while doing operations. (In the 2006 TV anime Black Jack finally gets his license). Despite his outlaw status, he is considered a miracle worker with his incomparable surgical technique and power of diagnostic analysis. His operations are generally over 10 million yen, but he more frequently helps the unfortunate for free or a token payment. He is sometimes accompanied by his short-tempered adopted daughter/assistant, Pinoko and can be recognized by a large cape, loose trench coat, and blue, black or red string tie (depending on the media) with black and white hair, dark eyes, and a graft of dark skin across the upper left of his face. Having learned wit playing with darts as a boy, is a skilled marksman as well as well-trained in martial arts. A statue of Black Jack stands in the Osamu Tezuka Museum beneath a skylight. * Bukk, Buku * Butamo, Makeru * Chikara, Aritake * Chiyoko, Wato * Deadcross, Lord * Don Dracula * Duke Red: A tall man with a large, hooked nose and spiky hair on the back of his head. He first appeared in Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis, a name he took back in the game Astro Boy: Omega Factor. He also played the title role in Osamu Tezuka's rendition of Cyrano de Bergerac and Prince Siddartha's doctor in Buddha. He made a few appearances in the Astro Boy manga (such as a mad scientist or a murdered priest) and other Tezuka productions, sometimes under the name Akai (\\"Red\\" in Japanese). He appeared in the 2003 Astro Boy TV series, in which he started a war against robots after thinking his robot servant hurt his daughter. * Fooler, Doctor * Frankenstein * Ham Egg: Also known as Cachatore, Hammond Eggs, Hamegg, or Simon Sakely (in Leo) he is a villain with a round head, a thin moustache, a wide grin, curly hair and sometimes a top hat. Primarily known for being a cruel circus manager in Astro Boy. He also was a hotel manager and an organ smuggler in Phoenix. He made other appearances in Astro Boy (such as a gangster or a murderous surgeon). In Kimba the White Lion, he portrays the hunter who kills Kimba/Leo's father and holds him captive during his infancy. * Hanamaru, Doctor * Heck, Ben * Higedaruma * Holmes, Rock: A young \\"bad boy\\" with shiny dark hair, sometimes wearing sunglasses. He mostly plays villains, after having played juvenile heroes. He was first in Rock Home, as a child detective. He appeared with Astro Boy several times. He was in Phoenix. He also starred in animated Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis as Duke Red's brutal son. In the Astro Boy: Omega Factor video game he is initially the real identity of the villain Deadcross, but falls in love with - and is reformed by - Princess Sapphire, and remains with her in the distant past to help her try to avert the demise of the continent of Mu. * Hyakkimaru * Hyoutan-Tsugi, also known as Gourdski, is a gag character, a small pig-faced patchworked gourd creature that puffs out smoke. Tezuka sometimes even making a character's face looking like it. It appears in almost all of his works, even in the 2009 CGI animated movie where he appears on a billboard. Some fans call it the real star of Tezuka's series. * Kao, Sekken * Kin, Sankaku: Translated as Golden triangle is the leader of the fictitious Chinese criminal organization based on the Triads. He has an ovoid head, fat lips, sunglasses, and one long hair. In an Astro Boy compilation, Tezuka explains that Kin was based on the local watchmaker's son from his childhood. * Kutter * Leo: A courageous, vegetarian white lion with black tips on his ears. Often known as \\"Kimba\\" in English-language translations, after he was given that name in Kimba the White Lion, the English dub of his 1960s anime series. In both his manga and anime series, he is known as Jungle Emperor Leo and acts as an ambassador toward the human world for animals. In Astro Boy: Omega Factor an android boy known as Pook disguises himself as Leo to steal jewels. * Maria * Marukubi, Boon * Mason * Melmo: Most frequently seen as various characters in the Black Jack manga of the 1970s. Melmo appears either as a 9-year-old or a 19-year-old. Although in her own series both versions of Melmo are the same person, she has sometimes appeared as a mother and a daughter. * Mitchy: A young, beautiful woman who portrayed the tragic android of the same name in Metropolis, she appeared as 'Tima' in the 2001 film adaptation of the manga. She was also recognized among fans as Astro's android mother in the original 1950s-1960s run of the Astro Boy manga. * Tima: A young and beautiful woman who died tragically, and was remade with human organs into android, she seem to be the daughter of Duke Red. Tima appears in the 2001 film version of Metropolis. * Monsieur Ampere * Norse, Necktall * Notaarin: Also known as Notarlin, an older, portly character with a round head, sometimes depicted with a moustache and a single hair on the back of his head. He apppears as the Superintendent of Police in Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis, also as the Atomic Energy Chairman in the manga version of Nextworld. * Ochanomizu, Professor: Mentor of Mighty Atom; often seen in Black Jack in positions of authority (councilman, company president, etcetera). * Omotanium: Not a character per se, but a fictional \\"substance\\" √† la kryptonite. It has different properties and performs different functions from story to story, such as destroying the brain system of a robot. * Phoenix, The * Pinoko * Pippy * Police Inspector Geta * Police Inspector Tawashi * Prime Rose: A girl with bushy red hair. She originally appeared as a black-clad warrior in black in Prime Rose, comic series in Weekly Sh≈çnen Champion, which was made into an animated movie in 1983. In Astro Boy: Omega Factor, she is Lamp's daughter. * Rainbow Parakeet: A tall young man with bobbed dark hair, red-tinted sunglasses, a white coat and ascot, and dark pants and gloves. He stars as the title character in his own manga as a thief (√† la Lupin III), and as the English cyborg private detective Sherlock Homespun (sometimes written Sherlock Holmespan) in the 1980 Astro Boy anime and Game Boy Advance game Astro Boy: Omega Factor. In the 2003 Astro Boy series he appears as a terrorist named Kato, who has no concrete goal, but regards his terrorism as art. * Riiko * Rommel * Saboten, Sam: A young man who replaced Rock in a series known as Saboten-Kun, mimicking the Hollywood practice of replacing actors during a series of films. * Sapphire: A young woman with slightly curly dark hair, who first starred in Princess Knight. She was the queen of the Mu civilization in the animated movie Marine Express (and in the Omega Factor game). * Saruta: A stocky man with a huge roundish nose. He appeared as all the Saruta descendants (including Gao) in the Phoenix saga and made some appearances in Buddha. In anime Black Jack TV, he appears like Jontaro Honma, the man who reconstructed the body of Black Jack after his accident when he was a kid. He looks somewhat similar to Professor Ochanomizu because he typically has a large, bulbous nose, but he is not the same character. * Sasaki, Kojiro * Saturn: A massive, brutal man with a big chin and a pointy moustache, he appeared as the King of Evil in Magic House and he fought Astro Boy as the robot called Satan. * Sharaku, Hosuke: A baby-faced young boy with a large head, often sporting a bandage.

He was used in the PlayStation 2 game Astro Boy in a side-quest. He was Assaji the apprentice monk in Buddha, still with his bandage. He appeared in the Black Jack anime, also with his bandage. Sharaku's third eye is hidden by the bandage and it suppresses both his power and evil nature. * Shikishima, Kenichi: Also called 'Ken' or 'Kennedy'. Is the nephew/assistant of Ban, Shunsaku and seems to have a crush on Tima. * Shumari * Skunk, Kusai: A pale, blonde smirking man with a short brown nose, sleepy eyes, and sometimes a gray complexion (which is made clear in the 1980 Astro Boy anime.)

They were sons of architect William Adam.  Life and career  Adam was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife in 1732 as the third son of the architect William Adam. In 1755 Adam worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Adam, along with his brother Robert started his business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the Grand Tour, leaving in May 1760 and arriving back in London in October 1763. Adam succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768‚Äì1772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739‚Äì1808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771‚Äì5 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. Adam emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. In 1793 he was part of a group of architects that John Soane was asked to supply plans to for the House of Lords. However, he died at his home in London's Albemarle Street in 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam (in 1773‚Äì1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

She was an expert on the dragonfly and an explorer. She was called \\"Madame Dragonfly\\" for her extensive work. She was passionately fond of dragonflies and her dominant area of interest was natural history. She travelled extensively and published The Dragonflies of the British Isles in 1937. She worked as a research associate at the Natural History Museum, London. Longfield was the expert on the dragonflies at the museum, researching particularly African species.  Early life  Cynthia Evelyn Longfield was born on 16 August, on Pont Street, Belgravia, London. She was the youngest daughter of Montifort and Alice Longfield, of Castle Mary, Cloyne, County Cork. She had two sisters. Alice Longfield grew up near Oxford, and was the daughter of a scientist. Alice died in 1945. The family home at Castle Mary was burned down in 1920 by rebels, and Park House was rebuilt on the grounds.  Career  She joined the Army Service Corps during WWI, later moving to an aircraft factory on Fullham Road. She visited South America between December 1921 and March 1922. She travelled to the Andes and Lake Titicaca. In 1923 she travelled to Egypt, where she caught a scorpion at the tomb of Ramases IX. In the same year answered an advertisement to join Evelyn Cheesman of London Zoo on a research trip to the Pacific, specifically the Galapagos Islands. They sailed aboard the St George, which left Dartmouth on 9 April 1924. She collected coleoptera and lepidoptera as an assistant to an entomologist, Cyril Collenette. The pair used machetes to hack through the undergrowth of the Amazon jungle to collect specimens for the Natural History Museum of London. She joined the Entomological Society of London in 1925, and later the same year joined the Royal Geographical Society. She was the first woman member of the Entomological Society. In 1926 she joined the London Natural History Society. She was elected president of the society for 1932 and 1933. On 28 March 1938 she joined the Auxiliary Fire Service, and ensured that a turntable ladder was used upon the bombing of the department in April 1941, during WWII. Cyril Collenette stated that her actions in relation to this likely saved the Museum from destruction. Longfield was a voluntary cataloguer at the Natural History Museum and was put in charge of work on dragonflies. She joined a six- month expedition to Matto Grosso, Brazil in 1927, and returned with samples of 38 of species of dragonfly. Three of these species were previously unidentified. The species Corphaeschna longfieldae is named in her honour. By 1937, Longfield had become an international authority on the subject of dragonflies and published a book entitled The Dragonflies of the British Isles. The book quickly sold out, and earned her the name \\"Madame Dragonfly\\". She was appointed an honorary associated of the Natural History Museum in 1948. In 1979 she donated dragonfly and damselfly specimens to the Royal Irish Academy, as well as her written records and more than 500 natural history books. In 1983 she was elected the first Honorary Member of the British Dragonfly Society. An exhibition entitled The Longfield exhibition was opened in the Royal Irish Academy on Dawson Street in 2006.  Death  Before her retirement from the Natural History Museum, Longfield purchased an apartment in Kensington, London, where she resided until her eventual retirement at age 60. In 1957, she returned to Castle Mary, the family estate, in Cloyne, County Cork where she lived until her death. She died aged 96 on 27 June 1991 and was buried in St. Coleman's Church of Ireland Cathedral, close to her home in Cloyne. Works *1914. Royal Army Service Corps, driver (1914‚Äì1916) *1916.

Peerce was an accomplished performer on the operatic and Broadway concert stages, in solo recitals, and as a recording artist. He is the father of film director Larry Peerce.AllMovie.com: Larry Peerce Family life Jan Peerce was born Jacob Pincus Perelmuth to a Jewish family. His parents, Louis and Henya Perelmuth, came from the village of Horodetz, formerly in Poland, now Belarus.Biographical sketch narrated by Jan's friend Isaac Stern Their first child, a daughter, died in an epidemic. In 1903 they emigrated to America along with their second child, a boy named Mottel. A year later, on June 3, 1904, their third child, Jacob Pincus, was born in a cold water flat in the Lower East Side, Manhattan, New York. He was nicknamed \\"Pinky\\" by his neighborhood friends. When he was three years old, his older brother Mottel was killed in an accident as he hitched a ride on an ice wagon. Jan remained on the Lower East Side until his 1930 marriage to Alice Kalmanovitz (1907-1994), a childhood friend. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School and Columbia University. At his mother's urging he took violin lessons, and gave public performances, including dance band work as Jack \\"Pinky\\" Pearl. Sometimes he also sang and it was soon discovered he was an exceptional lyric tenor. Peerce was the brother-in-law of fellow American tenor Richard Tucker. He died at his home in New Rochelle, New York on December 15, 1984 at the age of 80.The Daily New Rochelle Peerce is interred at Mount Eden Cemetery in Valhalla, Westchester County. Career Peerce studied singing in New York City with Giuseppe Boghetti. In 1932 he was hired as a tenor soloist with the Radio City Music Hall company by the impresario Roxy, who renamed him John Pierce. They soon compromised on the spelling Jan Peerce, which the singer felt better reflected his ethnicity. Thanks to radio broadcasts and stage programs, Peerce soon had a nationwide following. The legendary maestro Arturo Toscanini heard him singing Wagner on the radio and was able to contact Peerce through a mutual friend to see if he would like to audition for him. Toscanini found him to be the tenor he had sought to sing operatic and choral works with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. The recordings made during, or following, the NBC broadcasts are among the outstanding musical legacies of the mid-20th century. Toscanini was reportedly pleased with Peerce's professionalism, as well as his musical talents and his unusually native-sounding Italian; many have said that Peerce was Toscanini's \\"favorite tenor\\" during the Maestro's 17 years at NBC. Peerce recalled that Toscanini never lost his temper the way he famously did with other musicians even though Peerce believed he had the right to, on a few occasions. Peerce first sang with Toscanini on February 6, 1938, in Carnegie Hall in a broadcast performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony; the soloists also included soprano Vina Bovy, mezzo-soprano Kerstin Thorborg, and bass Ezio Pinza.Toscanini Online Peerce at an RCA Victor recording session, c. 1950 Peerce joined the roster of principal tenors at the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company (PLSOC) in 1938. He made his professional opera debut with the company on December 10 of that year as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's Rigoletto with Robert Weede in the title role and Fritz Mahler conducting. He also sang Alfredo in La traviata with Annunciata Garrotto as Violetta and Weede as Germont during the company's 1938-1939 season. Peerce sang in several more performance with the PLSOC through 1941, singing Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly with Elda Ercole as Cio-Cio-San, and reprising the roles of the Duke and Alfredo a number of times. In November 1939 Peerce performed his first solo recital in New York City. He made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera on November 29, 1941, singing Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata. He sang also the parts of Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca, Rodolfo in La boh√®me, and in Gounod's Faust. He was hailed by critics as the \\"All-American successor to the 'greats' of opera's almost extinct 'Golden Age'.\\" In 1943 he appeared in the OWI film, Hymn of the Nations, with Toscanini, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and the Westminster Choir in a performance of Verdi's then seldom-heard choral work. Filmed in NBC Studio 8-H, the performance has been issued on video-cassette and DVD. The headstone of Jan PeerceDuring the 1950s Peerce performed regularly as a featured soloist before audiences of over 14,000 guests under the conductor Alfredo Antonini at the Lewisohn Stadium in New York City. These Italian Night open-air concerts featured the New York Philharmonic and the Lewisohn Stadium Orchestra along with such operatic luminaries as Richard Tucker, Robert Merrill, and Eileen Farrell.The New York Times, August 8, 1949, pg. 11The New York Times, July 24, 1950, pg.26The New York Times, July 11, 1952, pg. 13The New York Times, July 18, 1952, pg. 10The New York Times, July 20, 1953, pg. 14The New York Times, July 10, 1954, pg. 6The New York Times, June 12, 1955, pg.

This tour featured June Preston, a former child film star, who at the age of 24, debuted as Mim√¨ in La boh√®me opposite Peerce as Rodolfo. In 1956 Peerce made a sensation in Moscow as a musical \\"cultural exchange\\" ambassador, being the first American to sing with the famed Bolshoi Opera. He remained on the roster of the Metropolitan until 1966, appearing again in 1966-1967. He also taught a master class. In 1971 he made his Broadway debut as Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof. The footstone of Jan PeerceHe continued to make occasional appearances until his retirement in 1982, remaining in fine voice. His last concert was on May 2, 1982, as the guest artist with the Beth Abraham Youth Chorale in Dayton, Ohio. Recordings Peerce's first recordings were made in 1931-1932, as a vocalist with New York area dance bands, using the names \\"Jack Pearl\\" and \\"Pinky Pearl.\\" Several of these were with the Jack Berger Orchestra, with whom he was appearing at the Hotel Astor. They include popular hits of the day such as \\"Snuggled on Your Shoulder\\" and \\"Dancing on the Ceiling,\\" and were issued on numerous smaller labels including Crown, Perfect, Banner and Melotone.Pinta, Emil R., \\"Early Dance-Band Vocals by Tenor Jan Peerce,\\" ARSC Journal, Vol. 43, No. 2 (Fall 2012), 225-234. Peerce recorded almost exclusively for RCA Victor as a \\"Red Seal\\" artist from the late 1930s to the early 1960s. Among his first RCA Victor recordings were as a featured soloist in Nathaniel Shilkret's 1939 tribute album to Victor Herbert. The year before that Peerce had been the tenor soloist in Toscanini's broadcast concert of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which was rejected for commercial release by RCA Victor; it wasn't until 1952 that Toscanini approved a studio recording of that symphony for release. Peerce as the Duke in Rigoletto Peerce sang in Toscanini's 1944 performance/broadcast of Beethoven's Fidelio with Rose Bampton, followed by the complete performances of Verdi's La traviata, Puccini's La boh√®me (both with Licia Albanese), and Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (with Herva Nelli), all eventually released on LP and CD. Peerce did not sing in Toscanini's broadcasts of Verdi's Otello, Aida, or Falstaff; he was offered the tenor parts in the latter two but declined, believing his voice was not right for those roles. He also sang in the Madison Square Garden concert in 1944, which featured the final act of Rigoletto with Leonard Warren, Zinka Milanov, and Toscanini conducting the combined New York Philharmonic and NBC Symphony Orchestra; this performance was recorded and also released on LP and CD. In 1952, he participated in Toscanini's only studio recording of the Beethoven Ninth Symphony, which the Maestro finally approved for release by RCA Victor. Among the operas Peerce recorded commercially for RCA Victor were Verdi's Rigoletto in 1950 with Leonard Warren singing the title role, Erna Berger, and Nan Merriman, Bizet's Carmen in 1951 with Ris√´ Stevens singing the title role, Licia Albanese, and Robert Merrill, and also Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor in 1957 with Roberta Peters, Philip Maero, and Giorgio Tozzi and Ariadne auf Naxos, with Leonie Rysanek, Sena Jurinac, Roberta Peters, and Walter Berry, conducted also by Erich Leinsdorf. Several opera excerpt albums with Peerce were released by RCA Victor as well including Samson et Dalila with Ris√´ Stevens and Madama Butterfly with Licia Albanese. Many broadcasts of performances from the Metropolitan opera and other houses with Peerce have been released on LP and CD as well. Peerce later recorded several operas and oratorios for Vanguard Records, a good majority of them Handelian. For Westminster Records in 1961 Peerce again recorded Fidelio opposite Sena Jurinac and for Columbia Records he sang the title role in a 1963 recording of selections from Sigmund Romberg's The Student Prince, opposite Roberta Peters, and also featuring Giorgio Tozzi. Peerce's final religious, pop, and recital albums from the late 1960s through 1980 were released on Vanguard. Peerce's best-selling record was his 1945 RCA Victor recording of \\"Bluebird of Happiness\\" (music by Sandor Harmati, lyrics by Edward Heyman and Harry Parr- Davies). It became his \\"signature tune\\" and he recorded it at least three times for RCA Victor. As of the late 1970s, it remained among the all-time best selling recordings by opera and concert singers. Bluebird was second in sales only to Enrico Caruso's 1918 recording of George M. Cohan's \\"Over There\\". Peerce titled his 1976 autobiography The Bluebird of Happiness: The Memoirs of Jan Peerce. = Recordings of complete operas = *Beethoven, Fidelio, Toscanini/Steber/Bampton/Peerce/Janssen/Belarsky, 1944, NBC Studio 8H, New York, Dec 10 and 17, RCA *Beethoven, Fidelio, Knappertsbusch/Stader/Jurinac/Peerce/Neidlinger/Ernster, 1961, Westminster *Bizet, Carmen, Reiner/Albanese-L/Stevens/Peerce/Merrill, 1951, RCA *Donizetti, Lucia di Lammermoor, Leinsdorf/Peters-R/Peerce/Maero/Tozzi, 1957, RCA *Gounod, Faust, Monteux/los √Ångeles/Miller-Mi/Peerce/Merrill/Siepi, 1955, live in New York, Melodram *Mozart, Don Giovanni, B√∂hm/Steber/della Casa/Peters-R/Peerce/Corena/Siepi, 1957, live in New York, Andromeda *Puccini, La Boh√®me, Toscanini/Albanese-L/McKnight/Peerce/Valentino, 1946, NBC Studio 8H, New York, Feb 3 and 10, RCA *Puccini, Madama Butterfly, Ormandy/Steber/Carr√©/Peerce/Bonelli, 1948, live in Los Angeles, VAI *Romberg, The Student Prince, Allers/Peters-R/Peerce, 1963, Columbia Masterworks *Strauss, Ariadne auf Naxos, Leinsdorf/Rysanek/Peters-R/Jurinac/Peerce, 1958, Decca *Verdi, Un ballo in maschera, Walter/Milanov/Greer/Thorborg/Peerce/Warren, 1944, live in New York, Jan 15, Myto *Verdi, Un ballo in maschera, Toscanini/Nelli/Haskins/Turner/Peerce/Merrill, 1954, Carnegie Hall, Jan 17 and 24 and June 3, RCA *Verdi, Un ballo in maschera, Mitropoulos/Milanov/Peters-R/Anderson-M/Peerce/Merrill, 1955, live in New York, Sony *Verdi, Rigoletto, Cellini/Berger/Peerce/Warren, 1950, RCA *Verdi, La traviata, Toscanini/Albanese-L/Peerce/Merrill, 1946, NBC Studio 8H, New York, Dec 1 and 8, RCA Film appearances Peerce made a few film appearances, most notably in 1947's Something in the Wind, in which he plays Tony the jailer.

Career overview He graduated from Harvard University in 1870 and studied at Harvard Law School in 1870 and 1871. Adams believed that commercial civilizations rise and fall in predictable cycles. First, masses of people draw together in large population centers and engage in commercial activities. As their desire for wealth grows, they discard spiritual and creative values. Their greed leads to distrust and dishonesty, and eventually the society crumbles. In The Law of Civilization and Decay (1895),Ludovici, Anthony (1944). \\"The Law of Civilization and Decay,\\" The New English Weekly 25, pp. 177‚Äì178. Adams noted that as new population centers emerged in the west, centers of world trade shifted from Constantinople to Venice to Amsterdam to London. He predicted in America's Economic Supremacy (1900) that New York would become the center of world trade. Adams was a great-grandson of John Adams, a grandson of John Quincy Adams, the youngest son of U.S. diplomat Charles Francis Adams, and brother to Charles Francis Adams Jr. and Henry Adams, philosopher, historian, and novelist, whose theories of history were influenced by his work. His maternal grandfather was Peter Chardon Brooks, the wealthiest man in Boston at the time of his death. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1918.

It has a length of approximately 960 kilometres and a catchment area of 367,201 km2 with Botswana, Namibia and South Africa sharing roughly about a third of the basin each. Course Its source is between Groot Marico and Lichtenburg and the river generally flows first to the west, and then to the southwest from its source. In its middle course the Molopo River forms a significant section of the border between Botswana and South Africa. River flow is intermittent and when it flows, its water flows very slowly owing to a gradient of only 0.76 m/km. Floods are rare because the vast sandveld areas of the Kalahari Desert on the Namibian side of its basin absorb all water from the seasonal rains. In case of exceptionally heavy and continuous precipitation the flow discharges into the Orange River, which it meets downstream of Augrabies Falls National Park at .Key rivers of South Africa It is believed that this last occurred more than 100 years ago. Tributary The main tributary of the Molopo is the Nossob, whose confluence is some 50 km south of Twee Rivieren, at 890m above sea level.

Adams was then assistant professor of Latin and history at Michigan from 1863 to 1867, and full professor of history from 1867 to 1885. Having studied in Germany, France, and Italy in 1867 and 1868, he followed the German method of instruction, and in 1869 and 1870 established an historical seminary which proved of great value in promoting the study of history and political science. In 1881 he was made non-resident professor of history at Cornell, and in 1885 succeeded White as president of Cornell. He was forced to resign at Cornell due to conflicts with the faculty over honorary degrees and control of faculty appointments.

He was Professor of Natural Philosophy in Maynooth College in County Kildare from 1834, and is best known for his work on the induction coil. Early life and education He attended school at an academy in Dundalk. His local parish priest, Father Andrew Levins, then took him in hand as an altar boy and Mass server, and saw him start the priesthood at Navan seminary. He entered Maynooth College in 1816. In his third year at Maynooth, Callan studied natural and experimental philosophy under Dr. Cornelius Denvir. He introduced the experimental method into his teaching, and had an interest in electricity and magnetism. Callan was ordained a priest in 1823 and went to Rome to study at Sapienza University, obtaining a doctorate in divinity in 1826. While in Rome he became acquainted with the work of the pioneers in electricity such as Luigi Galvani (1737‚Äì1798) who was a pioneer in bioelectricity and Alessandro Volta (1745‚Äì1827) who is known especially for the development of the electric battery. In 1826, Callan returned to Maynooth as the new Professor of Natural Philosophy (now called physics), where he also began working with electricity in his basement laboratory at the college. Reville, William. Nicholas Callan: Priest Scientist at Maynooth. The Irish Times, 21 February 2002. Induction coil Callan's Induction Coil at the National Science Museum, Maynooth Influenced by William Sturgeon and Michael Faraday, Callan began work on the idea of the induction coil in 1834. He invented the first induction coil in 1836.Callan, N.J. (December 1836) \\"On a new Galvanic battery,\\" Philosophical Magazine, series 3, vol. 9, pages 472‚Äì478; see especially page 477.Callan, N.J. (April 1837) \\"A description of an electromagnetic repeater, or of a machine by which the connection between the voltaic battery and the helix of an electromagnet may be broken and renewed several thousand times in the space of one minute,\\" Sturgeon's Annals of Electricity, vol. 1, pages 229‚Äì230 and Fig. 52 on page 522.Stanley A. Czarnik (March 1992) \\"The classic induction coil,\\" Popular Electronics, pages (?). Available on-line at: . An induction coil produces an intermittent high-voltage alternating current from a low- voltage direct current supply. It has a primary coil consisting of a few turns of thick wire wound around an iron core and subjected to a low voltage (usually from a battery). Wound on top of this is a secondary coil made up of many turns of thin wire. An iron armature and make-and-break mechanism repeatedly interrupts the current to the primary coil, producing a high- voltage, rapidly alternating current in the secondary circuit. Callan invented the induction coil because he needed to generate a higher level of electricity than currently available. He took a bar of soft iron, about long, and wrapped it around with two lengths of copper wire, each about long. Callan connected the beginning of the first coil to the beginning of the second. Finally, he connected a battery, much smaller than the enormous contrivance just described, to the beginning and end of winding one. He found that when the battery contact was broken, a shock could be felt between the first terminal of the first coil and the second terminal of the second coil. Further experimentation showed how the coil device could bring the shock from a small battery up the strength level of a big battery. So, Callan tried making a bigger coil. With a battery of only 14 seven-inch (178 mm) plates, the device produced power enough for an electric shock \\"so strong that a person who took it felt the effects of it for several days.\\" Callan thought of his creation as a kind of electromagnet; but what he actually made was a primitive induction transformer. Callan's induction coil also used an interrupter that consisted of a rocking wire that repeatedly dipped into a small cup of mercury (similar to the interrupters used by Charles Page). Because of the action of the interrupter, which could make and break the current going into the coil, he called his device the \\"repeater.\\" Actually, this device was the world's first transformer. Callan had induced a high voltage in the second wire, starting with a low voltage in the adjacent first wire. And the faster he interrupted the current, the bigger the spark. In 1837 he produced his giant induction machine: using a mechanism from a clock to interrupt the current 20 times a second, it generated sparks, an estimated 60,000 volts and the largest artificial bolt of electricity then seen. The 'Maynooth Battery' and other inventions Callan experimented with designing batteries after he found the models available to him at the time to be insufficient for research in electromagnetism. The Year-book of Facts in Science and Art, published in 1849,The Year-book of Facts in Science and Art (p.156), 1849, John Timbs has an article titled \\"The Maynooth Battery\\" which begins \\"We noticed this new and cheap Voltaic Battery in the Year-book of Facts, 1848, p. 14,5. The inventor, the Rev. D. Callan, Professor of Natural Philosophy in Maynooth College, has communicated to the Philosophical Magazine, No. 219, some additional experiments, comparing the power of a cast-iron (or Maynooth) battery with that of a Grove's of equal size.\\" Some previous batteries had used rare metals such as platinum or unresponsive materials like carbon and zinc. Callan found that he could use inexpensive cast-iron instead of platinum or carbon. For his Maynooth battery he used iron casting for the outer casing and placed a zinc plate in a porous pot (a pot that had an inside and outside chamber for holding two different types of acid) in the centre. Using a single fluid cell he disposed of the porous pot and two different fluids. He was able to build a battery with just a single solution. While experimenting with batteries, Callan also built the world's largest battery at that time. To construct this battery, he joined together 577 individual batteries (\\"cells\\"), which used over 30 gallons of acid.Nicholas Callan (July 1848) \\"On the construction and power of a new form of Galvanic battery,\\" Philosophical Magazine, series 3, vol. 33, no. 219, pages 49‚Äì53. Since instruments for measuring current or voltages had not yet been invented, Callan measured the strength of a battery by measuring how much weight his electromagnet could lift when powered by the battery. Using his giant battery, Callan's electromagnet lifted 2 tons.M.T. Casey (December 1985) \\"Nicholas Callan ‚Äì priest, professor and scientist,\\" IEE Proceedings, vol. 132, pt. A, no. 8, pages 491‚Äì497; see especially page 492. Available on-line at: http://eprints.nuim.ie/1767/1/CaseyCallan.pdf . The Maynooth battery went into commercial production in London. Callan also discovered an early form of galvanisation to protect iron from rusting when he was experimenting on battery design, and he patented the idea.Callan, Nicholas, \\"A means of protecting iron of every kind against the action of the weather and of various corroding substances so that iron thus protected will answer for roofing, cisterns, baths, gutters, pipes, window-frames, telegraph- wires for marine and various other purposes,\\" British patent no. 2340 (filed: 12 October 1853; issued: 25 November 1853).

Early life and education Frank Dawson Adams was born into a prosperous, middle-class family in Montreal, Quebec. Adams attended the High School of Montreal (a private school founded in 1843 and closely associated with McGill University after 1852).Cartwright, G.F., 2006. The High School of Montreal. As a pupil there, Adams received a classical education, and his knowledge of Latin was valuable later in life in his historical studies. At the age of sixteen he entered the Applied Science Program at McGill University, where he studied geology with John William Dawson (Principal of McGill since 1852) and Bernard Harrington (who had set up the Applied Science program). In unpublished notes McGill archives he described Harrington as \\"the professor who influenced me chiefly.\\" He graduated with first class honors in Applied Science in 1878, then spent a year at the Yale Scientific School, where he studied German, French, and mineralogy. It was there that he met George Wessel Hawes (1848-1882) a pioneer American petrologist, who had worked with Harry Rosenbusch in Germany. He also met a fellow-student, Andrew Cowper Lawson, and in 1888 they published a joint paper on their investigation of the mineral scapolite. Returning to Montreal, he was appointed Assistant Chemist at the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), and the following year (when the GSC moved to Ottawa), Assistant Chemist and Petrographer.Zaslow, M., 1975. Reading the Rocks: The Story of the Geological Survey of Canada 1842-1872. Toronto, Macmillan. He received a leave of absence to spend at least part of two years in Heidelberg, studying with Harry Rosenbusch, who by that time was the acknowledged master of microscopic petrography of igneous rocks.Young, D.A., 2003. Mind Over Magma: The Story of Igneous Petrology. Princeton University Press, p.154-165 Rosenbusch attracted students from many different countries. While Adams was in Heidelberg he met G.H. Williams and J.S. Diller, both of whom later became leading American petrologists, as well as Victor Goldschmidt and (Carl) Alfred Osann (1859‚Äì1923), who became famous geochemists in Europe.Mahler, J.P. and H.W. Pfefferkorn, 1988. The influence of the University of Heidelberg on the development of geology in North America between 1860 and 1913. Earth Sciences History, 7:33-43. In 1883, Adams published the first work in Canada that made full use of the petrographic microscope, as well as a paper indicating that he had already begun the field work north of Montreal, that later became the basis of his doctorate at Heidelberg. He received a master's degree from McGill in 1884, and his Ph.D. from Heidelberg University in 1892. His doctoral studies on the Morin anorthosite showed that these rocks were not metamorphosed sediments, as thought previously, but were igneous rocks that had been intruded into Grenville sediments and later metamorphosed in the Grenville orogeny. Career In 1889 Adams was appointed Lecturer in Geology at McGill University. He was appointed Logan Professor of Geology after the retirement of John William Dawson in 1892 and held this position until his own retirement in 1924. Though he was working full-time at McGill, he continued to spend summers in the field, financed by the GSC. In 1891 he began working on the Grenville of eastern Ontario, and by the following year had started to work on the Haliburton, Ontario area. His work there, carried out after 1896 with Alfred Barlow of the GSC, was published as a GSC Memoir in 1908, and became a classic of Canadian geology. The rocks, which included unusual alkaline rocks, were not merely mapped, but studied in detail using petrographic and chemical methods, and firm conclusions were drawn about their petrogenesis, all of which was unusual for a GSC Memoir at that time. At the same time, Adams was also studying the peculiar petrological characteristics of a group of alkaline intrusions of much later geological age (now known to be Early Cretaceous), called by him the \\"Monteregian Hills.\\" This work would be continued by his students, notably Joseph Austin Bancroft (1882-1957), who succeeded Adams as Logan Professor at McGill. Inspired by his observations on the flow of metamorphosed limestones in the Grenville, Adams began a series of pioneer experimental studies of the physical properties of rocks at high pressures and temperatures, carried out in collaboration with John Thomas Nicholson, Professor of Engineering at McGill.Easkins, P.R., 1972. Frank Dawson Adams -- Founder of modern structural geology. Proceedings of the Geological Association of Canada, 24: 13-16. This was well before comparable work was carried out in Germany or the United States. Though the experimental apparatus was primitive compared with that later developed at Harvard University and the Geophysical Laboratory in Washington, D.C., Adams' work was highly regarded by the newly founded Carnegie Institution for Science, which supported him financially, and attempted to persuade him to move to the Institution.Geschwind, C.-H., 1995.

He received many honors during his career, first becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1896, a Fellow of the Royal Society (of Great Britain) in 1907, a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1917, and awarded the Flavelle Medal, which is given for outstanding contributions to biological science, in 1937. The Frank Dawson Adams Building at McGill University is named in his honor. A plaque in his honor was erected on the Redpath Museum on the McGill campus in 1950. He retired from McGill in 1924, and began to travel widely, collecting books on the history of geology, as well as rocks and minerals for McGill. He published several papers on the geology of Ceylon and also on the history of geology, culminating in his book Birth and Development of the Geological Sciences (1938). It became a classic and was reprinted by Dover Publications in 1954. He left his rare book collection (1581 monographs) to McGill university.

History Vought F-8H Crusader II of VF-201 at Naval Air Station Dallas in October 1975 The United States Naval Reserve fighter squadron VF-201 was established at NAS Dallas on 25 July 1970, succeeding VF-124D1. It first flew the Vought F-8H Crusader, and in 1976 it transitioned to the McDonnell Douglas F-4N Phantom II. In 1984, the squadron transitioned to the F-4S Phantom II, the most advanced Phantom to enter service with the United States Navy. Soon the U.S. Navy moved to the policy that reserve units would have the same equipment as front line units, VF-201 transitioned to the Grumman F-14A Tomcat in early 1987 and was the last Navy squadron to fly the F-4. It took six months to complete the transition and soon VF-201 was carrier qualified on board the aircraft carrier . Even some of the F-14As received came directly from the production line at Grumman, and the unit received the final F-14A ever built. Within years the squadron was capable of dropping unguided bombs, cluster munitions TALD decoys, air laid mines, practice bombs, marker flares and various laser-guided bombs as the F-14 was reconfigured as a strike fighter. In 1993 they won the Battle ‚ÄúE‚Äù award and in 1994 the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Safety ‚ÄúS‚Äù award. The strike capability of the F-14 has been proven in exercises such as the deployment the squadron made to NAS Fallon in 1995 as part of training for the reserve air wing CVWR-20. A VF-201 F-4N in 1976. An F-14A of VF-201, 1987. Hornets of VFA-201 over New Orleans in May 2006. Later the unit would also be able to conduct TARPS reconnaissance missions, which were originally carried out by VF-202. But as some front line F-14 squadrons saw disestablishment during the 1990s, so did the two reserve fighter squadrons and VF-202 was disestablished. Due to budgetary cutbacks in active fleet aggressor squadrons, VF-201 also began flying as aggressors when needed. In 1996 VF-201, along with the rest of RCVW-20, deployed on the , during this deployment VF-201 had the opportunity to fire live weapons. The unit fired 7 AIM-9 Sidewinders, 6 AIM-7 Sparrows and 1 AIM-54 Phoenix, two additional Phoenix missiles were planned to be fired but due to technical difficulties this was aborted. VF-201 also dropped 17,000 lb of bombs. In July 1996 VF-201 deployed to NAS Key West in Florida to provide dissimilar air training for VFA-106 Gladiators, the U.S. East Coast F/A-18 training squadron. In August and September the same year, VF-201 deployed to NAS Oceana and got to fire two Phoenix missiles as well as participating in the SFARP (Strike Fighter Air Readiness Program) course. In November 1996 VF-201 deployed to NAS Fallon where they provided Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) for Carrier Air Wing Two. After this deployment to NAS Fallon, VF-201 moved to NAS Fort Worth. In 1997 the Hunters deployed for three days with six aircraft to Elmendorf AFB, Alaska for Exercise \\"Arctic Express 1-97\\". Originally this deployment had been scheduled for an active F-14 squadron, but they were unable to attend and so VF-201 filled the slot. Less than two weeks later. In late January, VF-201 took part in a scheduled deployment to NAS Fallon and the squadron dropped 195,000 lb of ordnance and shoot 3500 rounds of 20 mm cannon ammo. In March, VF-201 deployed to NAS Key West for a two-week detachment providing training to new F-14 crews from VF-101. In January 1999 the Hunters transitioned to the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornet because the F-14 Tomcat was out of production and the Navy senior leadership wanted the F-14As in the Naval Air Reserve reassigned back to active duty F-14 squadrons. VF-201 was re-designated VFA-201 to signify its new multi-mission capability as a strike fighter squadron. Some of their deployments included: Carrier detachments: USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, USS John F. Kennedy, USS Kitty Hawk, and the USS John C. Stennis. Tours of Duty locations: Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, Sigonella Airbase, Sicily, Key West NAS, FL., Fallon, NV., Oceana, VA., Point Magu, CA., and Eglin AFB, FL. = 2003 combat deployment = VFA-201 was the seventh tactical Navy reserve squadron mobilized since the Korean War (three East Coast based and three West Coast based USNR squadrons were activated during the Vietnam war on 28 January 1968), and were one of three reserve squadrons to deploy for combat operations (the other two were HCS-4 and HCS-5). After completing the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP) from their home base in Fort Worth and the Carrier Air Wing Eight coordinated strike detachment in Fallon, Nevada, they deployed on board from 6 January to 29 May 2003, where they received numerous awards for their performance over Iraq during the first phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In fact, the squadron delivered over 220,000 pounds of ordnance on Iraq targets. Additionally, VFA-201 had an unprecedented 84.6 target acquisition rate during Iraqi Freedom and won the Carrier Air Wing Eight landing grade competition for their entire workup and combat deployment. Eighteen of the nineteen pilots deployed were graduates of TOPGUN. = Decommissioning = VFA-201 was officially deactivated on 30 June 2007, and all hardware assets transferred to their Reserve sister squadron, VFA-204, or other active duty Navy and Marine Corps units.

He was a freelance author who helped to popularize the latest scholarship about American history and his three-volume history of New England is well regarded by scholars.Clyde N. Wilson, Twentieth-Century American Historians (Gale: 1983, Dictionary of Literary Biography, volume 17) pp 3-8 He coined the phrase \\"American Dream\\" in his 1931 book The Epic of America. Early life Adams was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a wealthy family, the son of Elizabeth Harper (n√©e Truslow) and William Newton Adams Jr. His father had been born in Caracas, Venezuela. His paternal grandfather William Newton Adams Sr. was American of English descent with roots in Virginia and his paternal grandmother Carmen Michelena de Salias, a Venezuelan of Spanish descent back to Gipuzkoa in the eighteenth century and a family from Seville. The earliest paternal ancestor was Francis Adams from England, an indentured servant who settled the Province of Maryland in 1638. Adams took his bachelor's degree from the New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn) in 1898, and a MA degree from Yale University in 1900. He entered investment banking, rising to partner in a New York Stock Exchange member firm. In 1912, he considered his savings ample enough to switch to a career as a writer. In 1917, he served with Colonel House on President Wilson's commission, \\"The Inquiry\\", to prepare data for the Paris Peace Conference. By 1918, he was a captain in the Military Intelligence Division of the General Staff of the U.S. Army. By late 1918, he was selected for the U.S. delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. His main task consisted in the provision of maps and the selection of plans and atlases that should be acquired by the War College, the American Geographical Society, and the Library of Congress. Writer Adams gained national attention with his trilogy on the history of New England (1921‚Äì26), winning the Pulitzer Prize for the first volume. Scholars welcomed his social history of the colonial era, Provincial Society, 1690‚Äì1763 (1927). He wrote popular books and magazine articles in a steady stream. His Epic of America was an international bestseller, and was included in Life Magazine's list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924‚Äì1944.Canby, Henry Seidel. '\\"The 100 Outstanding Books of 1924‚Äì1944\\". Life, 14 August 1944. Chosen in collaboration with the magazine's editors. He was also the editor of a scholarly multi-volume Dictionary of American History.James Truslow Adams, ed., and Roy V. Coleman, managing ed., Dictionary of American History, 5 vols. (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1940); 2nd, revised edition in 6 vols. (1942). Adams was the editor, with Roy V. Coleman as managing editor, of The Atlas of American History (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1943), and The Album of American History, 4 vols. (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1944).Clyde N. Wilson, Twentieth-Century American Historians (Gale: 1983, Dictionary of Literary Biography, volume 17) pp. 3‚Äì8 =American Dream= Adams coined the term \\"American Dream\\" in his 1931 book The Epic of America. His American Dream is \\"that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.\\" However, Adams felt the American Dream was in peril during the 1920s and 30s. He complained that \\"money making and material improvements . . . mere extensions of the material basis of existence\\", had gained ascendancy, becoming \\"goods in themselves . . . [mimicking] the aspects of moral virtues.\\" The original American Dream had always been about \\"quality and spiritual values\\": \\"The American dream that has lured tens of millions of all nations to our shores in the past century has not been a dream of merely material plenty, although that has doubtless counted heavily. It has been much more than that.\\" He warned that \\"in our struggle to 'make a living'\\" we were neglecting \\"to live\\". The Epic of America was his attempt save a \\"priceless heritage\\", and sustain the distinctly American understanding of progress in humane and moral terms. The true American Dream was of \\"a genuine individual search and striving for the abiding values of life\\", and for the \\"common man to rise to full stature\\" in the free realms of \\"communal spiritual and intellectual life.\\" James Truslow Adams, The Epic of America (1931; repr., New York: Blue Ribbon Books, 1941), 405, 406, 412, 415 (italics in original). For a discussion of Adams as the originator of the term American Dream, see James Cullen, The American Dream: A Short History of an Idea That Shaped a Nation (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 7, 191. See also Benjamin Hunnicutt, Free Time: The Forgotten American Dream, (Philadelphia, Temple Press, 2013). =Two educations= A quote from one of Adams' essays \\"There are obviously two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live\\" is widely misattributed to John Adams. The quote is part of an essay by Adams entitled \\"To 'Be' or to 'Do': A Note on American Education\\" which appeared in the June, 1929 issue of Forum. The essay is very critical of American education, both in school and at the university level, and explores the role of American culture and class-consciousness in forming that system of education. In a more complete version of that quote, Adams says: > There are obviously two educations. One should teach us how to make a living > and the other how to live. Surely these should never be confused in the mind > of any man who has the slightest inkling of what culture is. For most of us > it is essential that we should make a living ... In the complications of > modern life and with our increased accumulation of knowledge, it doubtless > helps greatly to compress some years of experience into far fewer years by > studying for a particular trade or profession in an institution; but that > fact should not blind us to another‚Äînamely, that in so doing we are learning > a trade or a profession, but are not getting a liberal education as human > beings. Death Adams lived in Southport, Connecticut, where he died of a heart attack. Honors After 1930, Adams was active in the American Academy of Arts and Letters serving as both chancellor and treasurer of that organization. He was also a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the Massachusetts Historical Society, American Antiquarian Society, American Historical Association, and the American Philosophical Society. Among British societies, he was honored as a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

Their first album, First Utterance, brought them a cult following, which persists. They reunited in 2009, and have played several festivals and released a new album. History Comus was formed in 1969 by fellow art students Roger Wootton and Glenn Goring, who developed their musical style performing in folk clubs in and around Bromley in Kent. The band was named after Comus (a masque by John Milton), and also after the name of the Greek god Comus. The band grew from an early folk duo to a six-piece ensemble; in that later form, David Bowie came to appreciate them. They appeared regularly at his Arts Lab project in Beckenham, Kent. He also invited them to be his support act in a 1969 concert at London's Purcell Rooms.Sleeve notes from the 1995 remastered version of First Utterance (BGO CD275) Their first album, First Utterance, with cover art by Wootton and Goring, appeared in 1971. The music is largely acoustic art rock (also described as acoustic metal and acid folk) that blends elements of Eastern percussion, early folk and animal-like vocals. The lyrics involve violence, murder, mental disorder and the mystical. Tiny Mix Tapes rated First Utterance five stars out of five. After the album, woodwind player Rob Young was replaced by Lindsay Cooper, and the new lineup developed material for a never-released second album. No recording by this lineup would see the light of day for another 40 years. The group disbanded for a time, but Wootton, Andy Hellaby and Bobbie Watson reformed the band with new members for their second album, To Keep from Crying, in 1974. A complete box set was released in 2005; this features both studio albums, their only single, \\"Diana\\", and a previously unreleased track called \\"All the Colours of Darkness\\". The liner notes feature an exclusive interview with some members of the band. They reformed for the Mellotronen Festival in Sweden in March 2008. They have continued to perform occasional gigs, including some new material. On 13 June 2009, Comus performed for the first time in the UK in 37 years, at the Equinox Festival at Conway Hall. A reunion album, Out Of The Coma, was released in June 2012. It contains three new tracks: \\"Out of The Coma\\", \\"The Sacrifice\\" (both Wootton) and \\"The Return\\" (Goring), plus a 1972 live recording of material from their abandoned followup to First Utterance, \\"The Malgaard Suite\\". Sputnik Music rated Out Of The Coma 3.5 out of 5. Louder Sound rated it four stars out of five. The members were active outside Comus. Wootton also appears on some recordings by Slapp Happy. Cooper went on to join Henry Cow. Reed player Jon Seagroatt is also a member of free-improvising trio Red Square. Colin Pearson went on to produce hits for other artists, including \\"Forever Young\\" for Alphaville. Seagroatt and singer Bobbie Watson married in 2003. Influence In 1998, Opeth singer and songwriter Mikael √Ökerfeldt used part of a sentence from \\"Drip Drip\\" for the title of the album My Arms, Your Hearse. The full line was \\"As I carry you to your grave, my arms your hearse\\". Another nod to Comus was given on the 2005 Opeth album Ghost Reveries. The second track, \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\", was derived from a line in the song \\"Diana\\" which reads, \\"And she knows by the sound of the baying, by the baying of the hounds\\". English experimental band Current 93 covered the song \\"Diana\\" from First Utterance on their studio album Horsey. Musically, this version differs considerably from the original, with David Tibet singing the lyrics in an agonized fashion and constructing most of the song from a loop based around a vertiginous violin arrangement from the original.

Biography =Early life= Gregor Piatigorsky was born in Ekaterinoslav (now Dnipro in Ukraine) into a Jewish family. As a child, he was taught violin and piano by his father. After seeing and hearing the cello, he was determined to become a cellist and was given his first cello when he was seven. He won a scholarship to the Moscow Conservatory, studying with Alfred von Glehn, Anatoliy Brandukov, and a certain Gubariov. At the same time he was earning money for his family by playing in local caf√©s. He was 13 when the Russian Revolution took place. Shortly afterwards he started playing in the Lenin Quartet. At 15, he was hired as the principal cellist for the Bolshoi Theater. The Soviet authorities, specifically Anatoly Lunacharsky, would not allow him to travel abroad to further his studies, so he smuggled himself and his cello into Poland on a cattle train with a group of artists. One of the women was a heavy-set soprano who, when the border guards started shooting at them, grabbed Piatigorsky and his cello. The cello did not survive intact, but it was the only casualty. Now 18, he studied briefly in Berlin and Leipzig, with Hugo Becker and Julius Klengel, playing in a trio in a Russian caf√© to earn money for food. Among the patrons of the caf√© were Emanuel Feuermann and Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler. Furtw√§ngler heard him and hired him as the principal cellist of the Berlin Philharmonic. =United States= In 1929, he first visited the United States, playing with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski and the New York Philharmonic under Willem Mengelberg. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, in January 1937 he married Jacqueline de Rothschild, daughter of √âdouard Alphonse James de Rothschild of the wealthy Rothschild banking family of France. That fall, after returning to France, they had their first child, Jephta. Following the Nazi occupation in World War II, the family fled the country back to the States and settled in Elizabethtown in the Adirondack Mountains, New York. Their son, Joram, was born in Elizabethtown in 1940. From 1941 to 1949, he was head of the cello department at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and he also taught at Tanglewood, Boston University, and the University of Southern California, where he remained until his death. The USC established the Piatigorsky Chair of Violoncello in 1974 to honor Piatigorsky. Piatigorsky participated in a chamber group with Arthur Rubinstein (piano), William Primrose (viola) and Jascha Heifetz (violin). Referred to in some circles as the \\"Million Dollar Trio\\", Rubinstein, Heifetz, and Piatigorsky made several recordings for RCA Victor.cello.org biography He played chamber music privately with Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, Leonard Pennario, and Nathan Milstein.Thiollet, Jean-Pierre (2012), Piano ma non solo, Anagramme Ed., p. 147. Piatigorsky also performed at Carnegie Hall with Horowitz and Milstein in the 1930s.Plaskin, Glenn (1983). Biography of Vladimir Horowitz Quill In 1965 his popular autobiography Cellist was published. Gregor Piatigorsky died of lung cancer at his home in Los Angeles, California, in 1976. He was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Instrument He owned two Stradivarius cellos, the \\"Batta\\" and the \\"Baudiot\\". From 1939 to 1951 Piatigorsky also owned the famous modern Italian Montagnana cello (by Jago Peternella) known as the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\". Appraisal It has been reported that the great violin pedagogue Ivan Galamian once described Piatigorsky as the greatest string player of all time. He was an extraordinarily dramatic player. His orientation as a performer was to convey the maximum expression embodied in a piece. He brought a great authenticity to his understanding of this expression. He was able to communicate this authenticity because he had had extensive personal and professional contact with many of the great composers of the day. Many of those composers wrote pieces for him, including Sergei Prokofiev (Cello Concerto), Paul Hindemith (Cello Concerto), Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco (Cello Concerto), William Walton (Cello Concerto), Vernon Duke (Cello Concerto), and Igor Stravinsky (Piatigorsky and Stravinsky collaborated on the arrangement of Stravinsky's \\"Suite Italienne\\", which was extracted from Pulcinella, for cello and piano; Stravinsky demonstrated an extraordinary method of calculating fifty-fifty royaltiesPrieto 2006, p.251). At a rehearsal of Richard Strauss's Don Quixote, which Piatigorsky performed with the composer conducting, after the dramatic slow variation in D minor, Strauss announced to the orchestra, \\"Now I've heard my Don Quixote as I imagined him.\\" Piatigorsky had a magnificent sound characterized by a distinctive fast and intense vibrato and he was able to execute with consummate articulation all manner of extremely difficult bowings, including a downbow staccato of which other string players could not help but be in awe. He often attributed his penchant for drama to his student days when he accepted an engagement playing during the intermissions in recitals by the great Russian basso, Feodor Chaliapin. Chaliapin, when portraying his dramatic roles, such as the title role in Boris Godunov, would not only sing, but declaim, almost shouting. On encountering him one day, the young Piatigorsky told him, \\"You talk too much and don't sing enough.\\" Chaliapin responded, \\"You sing too much and don't talk enough.\\" Piatigorsky thought about this and from that point on, tried to incorporate the kind of drama and expression he heard in Chaliapin's singing into his own artistic expression. Works Piatigorsky was also a composer. His Variations on a Paganini Theme (based on Caprice No. 24) was composed in 1946 for cello and orchestra and was orchestrated by his longtime accompanist Ralph Berkowitz; it was later transcribed for cello and piano.

Long active in a variety of visual formats, he is known for his work in book cover art, portrait painting, poster, advertising and album art. He is most widely known for his book cover art for the paperback editions of Agatha Christie. Family background and influence Adams was born into a family of town and urban planners. His grandfather, Thomas Adams (1871‚Äì1940), was an influential urban planner, who served as an advisor to Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt and went on to found the Civic Improvement League in 1915 and the Town Planning Institution of Canada in 1919. Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to suggest that Thomas Adams was one of the principal founders of urban planning as a discipline. His two sons went on to make their mark in American and English town and urban planning. The younger son, Frederick Johnstone Adams, was a member of the faculty of MIT from 1932 to 1964, who helped to establish the Department of Urban Studies and Planning, serving as its first Head of Department from 1944-1957. Tom Adams's father, James W. Renwick Adams OBE (1898‚Äì1969), worked as a planner for the English county council of Kent. From this background, the strong sense of visual composition in Tom Adams's work becomes more understandable. Moreover, Adams's visual work is drawn to the challenge of integrating seemingly disparate elements into an integral whole. Early life and career Adams served for two years in the navy (1944‚Äì1946). He then trained at the Chelsea School of Art and Goldsmith's College, where he received a National Diploma of Painting in 1949. Between 1953 and 1960 Adams provided illustrations for the youth-oriented UK publications Eagle, Girl and Swift. In 1958, he founded Adams Design Associates with Anna and Andy Garnett, where he produced large murals in the then-new medium of laminated plastic for various firms such as The Royal Bank of Scotland, Chartered Bank, Aspro Nicholas and Airscrew Jicwood. In 1965, Adams joined his father, the late James W.R. Adams OBE, eminent town planner and landscape architect, who was planning and design consultant to the Poster Advertising Planning Committee, for whom he helped produce a book: Posters Look to the Future. Creative activities In the 1960s and 1970s he became involved with several distinguished poets, including Edward Lucie-Smith, Ted Hughes, C. Day Lewis, Brian Patten, George MacBeth and Adrian Henri as well as artists Sandra Blow, John Piper, Josef Herman, and Mark Boyle and among others, producing poetry prints published by his own gallery, the Fulham Gallery, London. Adams also designed posters for Mark Boyle's light shows (The Sensual Laboratory), the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Soft Machine. His connection with the modern world of rock music continued when he met Lou Reed, an admirer of his Christie and Raymond Chandler covers. Adams designed the cover for his first UK solo album. During this period, Adams met Virgil Pomfret and joined his artists' agency. Apart from a few gaps when pursuing other activities (like running art galleries), Adams remained with Pomfret for many years. With Pomfret's representation, Adams began a career as a book cover illustrator, most notably for the early John Fowles's novels The Collector, The Magus and The French Lieutenant's Woman and the now famous paperback covers for Agatha Christie (Collins UK and Simon & Schuster USA). A book on these cover paintings, Tom Adams‚Äô Agatha Christie Cover Story with commentary by Julian Symons and Introduction by John Fowles was published in 1981 by Dragons World. He also designed several covers for Raymond Chandler. Adams also provided the illustrations for the hardback editions of John Fowles' The Collector, The Magus and The French Lieutenant's Woman. He also created the covers for Patrick White's The Vivisector, David Storey's Saville. Ghost Story by Peter Straub and Kingsley Amis' Colonel Sun. Around this time, having completed a private commission to paint a portrait of Benjamin Britten in 1971, the Aldeburgh Festival committee commissioned him to produce a limited edition print with William Plomer and Mary Potter as part of the fundraising for the restoration of the Snape Maltings. His occasional portrait commissions have included HRH Prince of Wales, Benjamin Britten (twice), Federico Fellini for the Playboy organization, Bud Flanagan, Richard Dimbleby, and President Tubman of Liberia. In 1997, he was commissioned to paint a posthumous portrait of Enid Blyton, whose centenary occurred that year, by the family and estate, in the style of the Britten portrait. This was later auctioned at Sotheby's in aid of the Children's Charity, The Royal Variety Club of Great Britain. Tom Adams has worked in films from time to time, mostly science fiction, including 2001: A Space Odyssey and Flash Gordon with Nic Roeg and Mike Hodges. In music, he has done covers for Lou Reed's self-titled album and Iron Maiden's compilation Edward the Great.Tom Adams Gallery The Agatha Christie paperback covers Agatha Christie was no newcomer to the paperback format. Indeed, she was part of Allen Lane‚Äôs famous ten-book launch of Penguin Books. The success of Penguin Books in the UK and PocketBooks in the US‚Äîniche paperback publishers‚Äîin the years following WWII, inspired traditional publishers to produce paperbacks. By the early 60s, Collins decided it wanted to do something more artistically distinct with Christie‚Äôs paperback covers. Impressed with Adams‚Äôs cover for John Fowles‚Äô The Collector, Collins engaged Adams. He was commissioned to do a trial cover of A Murder Is Announced, which was published with his cover in 1962. Everyone involved was pleased with the outcome. As a result, Adams ended up doing covers for many of Christie's paperbacks, often more than once. The covers he primarily did not create art for were the pre-1926 books which Fontana did not have the publishing rights to. PocketBooks in the US very much wanted more realistic covers. For this reason, most of Adams's covers for the US editions feature a single dramatic or portentous scene from the novel than spans the front and rear covers. The two exceptions are \\"Nemesis\\" and \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\". Fontana in the UK was much more open to Adams's creative input. Thus, the UK covers were often akin to a stylized tableau or surrealist collage. Adams ended up doing the covers for Agatha Christie paperbacks for twenty-eight years (1962-1980), thus becoming connected with her intimately in the minds of many readers. Technique and style Adams's book cover artwork, while usually instantly recognizable, runs to quite distinct modes. Some covers are still-life tableaux; some are depictions of a scene in the novel; some are surrealist collations of items and images. Organizing the vast majority of them, however, is Adams's unique exploration of a form that was vital for much of twentieth- century art: the collage. Adams's unique take on this was to bring the collage back into the realm of the painterly. Seen in this light, even Adams's covers that seem like still lifes are, in actuality, juxtapositions of elements and objects that normally are not in such proximity. It is this uncanny proximity‚Äîdespite (or, rather, precisely because of) the near photo-realistic accuracy‚Äîthat creates the unsettling effect. This element also goes to explain one of the most distinctive features of Adams's art: the combination of a sought-after realistic accuracy with an unsettling, surrealist, if not alienating, effect. As Janet Morgan, Agatha Christie's first biographer, put it, Adams's drawings are \\"alarmingly realistic.\\" Dr. Who Adams' design for the Fontana Books edition of the Agatha Christie mystery Death in the Clouds, featuring a giant wasp, inspired the monster in the Doctor Who adventure The Unicorn and the Wasp, broadcast in 2008. A copy of the book, featuring Adams' cover, appeared in the episode. Awards and publications Adams won various awards for illustration, notably the American Society of Illustrators, The American Art Directors Association, and The Design and Art Directors Association, UK. His work is in numerous private collections and he has exhibited in London, Toronto, Tokyo, Dublin, Sydney, Marbella, and more recently in Exeter and Torquay, the setting for many of Agatha Christie‚Äôs mysteries. He designed, printed and published his own limited editions Two monographs have been published on his work: Tom Adams' Agatha Christie Cover Story (published as Agatha Christie: The Art of Her Crimes in the United States), Paper Tiger, 1981 and Tom Adams Uncovered, HarperCollins, 2015.

It is the last of the novels of Shaw's middle period before he began to concentrate, in his last works such as Evening In Byzantium, Nightwork, Bread Upon The Waters, and Acceptable Losses, on the inevitability of impending death. The title is taken from the nursery rhyme \\"Tinker, Tailor\\". The novel was adapted into a 1976 miniseries. Background The novel is a sprawling work, with over 600 pages, and covers many of the themes Shaw returns to again and again in all of his fiction ‚Äì Americans living as expatriates in Europe, the McCarthy era, children trying to break away from the kind of life lived by their parents, social and political issues of capitalism, the pain of relationships. On the very first page Shaw subtly telegraphs the sad ending of the story, in the same way that the first scene of a film will often quote the last scene. Originally published as a short story in Playboy Magazine, it became an international bestseller when published as a novel. The bulk of the novel concerns the three children of German Americans Mary Pease and Axel Jordache ‚Äì the eldest, Gretchen, the middle child, Rudolph, and the youngest, Thomas. It chronicles their experiences from the end of World War II until the late 1960s. Plot summary In the early parts of the novel Shaw goes to great lengths to make the point about \\"Jordache blood\\" ‚Äì violent, bitter, resentful. One of the ways he does this is by meticulously describing the hate-filled marriage of the parents, Mary and Axel. The novel is told in the third person omniscient point of view but never wholly objectively, often through the lens of the consciousness of one of the five family members. When told through the POV of either Mary or Axel the view of humanity, and of the Jordache family, is relentlessly bleak and pessimistic. The tripwire that sets all of the ensuing plot action in motion occurs when Gretchen Jordache begins an affair with the president of the company she works for, Teddy Boylan, a man much older than herself. Eventually her brothers Rudolph and Thomas also become involved with Boylan, in different ways, and it is his influence upon all three that first springs each of them into the world beyond the small upstate New York town where their parents scrape by with their bakery. Boylan constitutes their first true encounters with an adult beyond their parents. Many people, mainly because of their familiarity with the miniseries rather than the actual source material, thought of the story as a very simplistic juxtaposition of the virtuous, goody two shoes brother (Rudolph) with the black sheep, ne'er-do- well younger sibling (Thomas, whom Shaw seeks to differentiate psychologically by means of a physical symbol ‚Äì he is the only blond haired member of the family), but the novel is much more complex than this in its demonstrative understructure. For example, Rudolph is constantly developing positive relationships only with people who can help him - his father, Mr. Calderwood, Johnny Heath, Boylan. In stark contrast to this both Gretchen and Thomas consistently entangle themselves with the kinds of people that modern self- help literature calls \\"drain people\\" or \\"toxic people\\". A couple of examples: Thomas' only friend in the world, Claude, gives him up immediately to the authorities the second his own well being is threatened, and when Axel Jordache learns of Tom's actions his only impulse is to get rid of him, to send him away to live with family in Ohio. Contrast this with Rudolph's friend, Johnny Heath, who becomes his lifelong friend, attorney, and business partner, and also with what Axel Jordache does when confronted by Rudolph's French teacher over a behavior miscue ‚Äì he slaps the teacher in the face. We cannot imagine him defending either Gretchen or Thomas in this manner. Boylan serves as the macguffin that drives the plot for all three of the Jordache siblings. For Gretchen he is an introduction to the world of men and relationships. He awakens in her the realization that she is the kind of woman who reduces men to cowering wimps but who cannot, perhaps somewhat paradoxically, put together a sound, completely fulfilling relationship. Her marriage to Willie Abbott collapses under the weight of his alcoholism and her marriage to Colin Burke ends in tragedy when Burke dies in a car accident. Similarly none of her numerous affairs bear any genuine emotional fruit. It is because of Boylan that Thomas embarks on a savage act of vandalism (with his friend Claude, who eventually turns him in). When caught, the men of the town present Axel Jordache with a choice ‚Äì send Thomas away or let him and the family face the consequences with the law. Jordache sends him away to live with his brother in Ohio, thus beginning a pattern that is repeated over and over and over in the novel: Thomas settles somewhere for a while, does OK for a time, then gets into trouble and has to flee. Finally Boylan offers to pay for Rudolph to go to college. Although on one level Rudolph despises Boylan as a petty vindictive rich pervert of an old man, he sees another side of him as well - the financially independent man of the world who wants for nothing. Shaw uses Rudolph's even, balanced judgment of Boylan as a counterpoint to the wholly negative, wholly one-sided opinion of him both Gretchen and Thomas, in their own separate ways, cling to. Adaptations A 1976 miniseries adaptation of the novel premiered on ABC and starred Peter Strauss as Rudy, Susan Blakely as Julie and Nick Nolte as Tom.http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=richmanpoo In 1982 an adaptation of Shaw's novel was realised by Lithuanian Film Studios of the Soviet TV.\\"–ë–æ–≥–∞—á, –±–µ–¥–Ω—è–∫ ...\\" In 2011, a Turkish drama was also an adaptation of Rich Man, Poor Man with a different twist: Kuzey Guney 2011-2013 mini series, starring Kivanc Tatlitug, Bugra Gulsoy and Oyku Karayel; Merve Bolugur (Turkish/Istanbul).

Adams was educated at Harrison College, from which he won a Barbados Scholarship to Magdalen College of the University of Oxford. =Prime Minister= He served as the second Prime Minister of Barbados between 1976 and 1985. His party, the Barbados Labour Party (BLP), had capitalized on the population's desire for a change from Errol Barrow's Democratic Labour Party, which had governed the island since independence in 1966. Adams moved the country back towards the liberalism the BLP had been founded on, a trend in keeping with the popularity of liberal economist Friedrich Hayek in Margaret Thatcher's Britain and Ronald Reagan's United States in the early 1980s. Adams also maintained close relations with the US, and he was the leading proponent in the grouping of Eastern Caribbean states that asked Reagan to intervene in overthrowing the Cuban-backed communist regime of Bernard Coard who had toppled Maurice Bishop, who was later murdered, in Grenada. Barbados was used as a staging point for some of the U.S. forces, and a nominal contingent of the Barbados Defence Force accompanied in the invasion force's wake, not least to allow (as Barrow claimed) Reagan to gild the statistics. The Barbadian population was of two minds about Adams' move, generally conceding that Bishop's murder had moved Grenada too far, but being uneasy with Reagan's US heavy-handedness. Nevertheless, Adams' BLP was tipped to win the upcoming elections at the time. Adams died of a heart attack at Ilaro Court, the Prime Minister's official residence, on March 11, 1985. He was the first sitting Prime Minister of Barbados to die in office. He was buried in Bridgetown, Barbados, at the churchyard of the Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels on Saint Michael's Row. Queen Elizabeth II was among global leaders who sent condolence as was addressed to Sir High Springer, the then Governor-General of Barbados, which read: > ‚Ä≥I was very shocked to hear of the sudden death of the prime minister, and > Prince Philip and I send our deepest sympathy to the government and people > of Barbados. The distinguished service given by Tom Adams to Barbados and to > the Commonwealth (of Britain and its former colonies) during nine years as > prime minister will always be remembered.‚Ä≥Barbados Prime Minister Dies Of > Heart Attack, By Tony Cozier, March 12, 1985, The Associated Press of the > U.S.A. Adams' deputy Prime Minister, Bernard St. John, succeeded him but the Barbadian electorate turned back to the other political party, voting in Errol Barrow, and his Democratic Labour Party in the subsequent election in 1986. Barrow also died in office in 1987 shortly after his election victory.  Legacy  The ten-story building in Bridgetown which houses the Central Bank of Barbados is today known as the Tom Adams Financial Centre in his honour. He is also one of the namesakes of the island's ABC Highway.

Karl Ivan Westman (August 5, 1889 ‚Äì April 24, 1970) was a Swedish diplomat who served as Sweden's Ambassador to Switzerland in Bern between 1928 and 1838 and at the League of Nations, in connection with the Continuation War Sweden's ambassador to Helsinki March 1941 ‚Äì October 1942, and after World War II Sweden's ambassador to Paris 1947‚Äì1956. Westman had, as the highly intelligent man he was, done a fast career in Sweden's foreign ministry. His analyses of the host countries, and the power play at the League of Nations, were considered outstanding‚Äîa judgement that holds also in retrospect. The mission at the League of Nations was considered central to Sweden's foreign policy during the interbellum; and when appointed to Helsinki, that was at a moment when it was considered the most crucial of Sweden's embassies. For a diplomat, he was however also extraordinarily outspoken, often with a significant amount of sarcasm and unveiled criticism. Karl Ivan Westman was the brother of Karl Gustaf Westman, Sweden's Justice Minister during World War II. Finland and Operation Barbarossa In his youth, Westman had been involved in the Nationalist Activism movement, which provided him both with relevant contacts and a good understanding for contemporary thinking in independent Finland. But he was also critical of its political development, from the bloody aftermath of the Civil War and forth, and particularly suspicious against the fennoman school of thoughts that dominated outside of the Finland-Swedish circles, and what he perceived as their strong anti-Nordic undercurrent. His outspoken opposition against the host country's increasing cooperation with Nazi Germany, in the run up to and during the Continuation War, led to an unfortunate failure of his mission to Helsinki. His reports to Stockholm were factually correct, but he was unsuited to reestablish a Finnish feeling of trust for the Swedes after the trauma of the Winter War, and what in Finland was widely perceived as Sweden's betrayal; and in Helsinki the suspicion grew that his reports were in fact unfavorable. Most crucially, he never came on speaking terms with Finland's foreign minister Rolf Witting, despite their shared mother tongue. This contributed to the abortion of close intelligence cooperation between the two countries, and resulted among other things in a total failure for the Swedish attempts to improve the relations with the Third Reich be means of some kind of cooperation in Operation Barbarossa‚Äîexecuted as \\"support for Finland's heroic struggle against Bolshevism\\"‚Äîat the same time intending to ease Finland's emotional dependency on Germany. Westman argued, not without some merit, that his views truly represented those of the Swedish government and civil service in general, and specifically the views of the cabinet. The realpolitik policies of Foreign Minister G√ºnther were not as popular in the left-leaning majority of the Cabinet now, when a clash between Nazism and Communism was on the agenda, as it had been during the zenith of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. What he said in Helsinki, he was convinced, was totally in accordance with the views of influential Social Democrats as √ñsten Und√©n and Ernst Wigforss, and also with the generally neutralist Liberals and Agrarians. After Finland's re- conquest of Vyborg, that had been a Swedish‚ÄìFinnish key castle 1293‚Äì1721, a general display of flags was proclaimed for August 30. In an unprecedented move, Sweden's embassy did not fly the flags, and soon Finland's Foreign Minister requested his removal. It would however last yet a year, and require the request of President Ryti, until Westman was recalled to Stockholm and replaced by a less controversial diplomat. Westman felt the recall from Helsinki to be a humiliating reprimand, for which some kind of compensation was to be expected.

He worked in both the Near East and Mesoamerica. A long time professor of the University of Chicago, he was best known for his research in Iraq. Early life and education Born in Chicago, Illinois, he received his doctorate from the University of Chicago (1957), where he was also employed as a member of the faculty. He was Director of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago (1962‚Äì68, 1981‚Äì83). He served as the Provost of the University of Chicago (1982‚Äì84). He was an Adjunct Professor at the University of California, San Diego, at the time of his death. Secretary of the Smithsonian Adams and Nancy Reagan at the presentation of a portrait head of Grace Kelly at the National Portrait Gallery in October 1986, alongside Kelly's widower, Prince Rainier III of Monaco, and her children, Albert, Caroline and St√©phanie Adams served as the ninth secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. from 1984 to 1994. He was installed as Smithsonian Secretary on September 17, 1984, becoming the head of an Institution with thirteen museums, a National Zoo, and scientific and cultural research facilities in nine states and the Republic of Panama. As the successor to S. Dillon Ripley, Adams sought to prepare the Institution for the 21st century, focus on scholarship, increase public programs, and emphasize a broader representation and involvement of diverse ethnic and cultural communities in the Smithsonian and its programs. Adams oversaw construction of the Quadrangle, a building project that brought together two museums and many disparate offices into a single structure, but he also sounded the alarm to the US Congress about the state of the Institution's aging infrastructure and began the systematic renovation of existing facilities. These \\"bricks and mortar\\" projects included renovation of the Freer Gallery of Art, the construction of the Mathias Laboratory at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, and the Earl S. Tupper Research and Conference Center at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. During Adams' tenure, the Smithsonian acquired the National Museum of the American Indian, and the National Postal Museum was established to showcase the National Philatelic Collection. The National Science Resources Center was created to improve the teaching of pre-college science and mathematics, and the International Center was established to explore ancient and evolving cultures and to serve as the Smithsonian's headquarters for Latin American scholarship, exhibitions, and programs. Adams formed the Smithsonian Cultural Education Committee to promote diversity across all aspects of Smithsonian operations. He also encouraged digitization projects, such as the National Air and Space Museum's videodisc technology for storage and retrieval of documents, photos, and other information. The \\"culture wars\\" arrived at the Smithsonian in 1991, with criticisms of The West as America, an exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. In 1994, Science in American Life, at the National Museum of American History, provoked outcries from the scientific community for its critical look at American science. And the first script for the Enola Gay exhibit in the National Air and Space Museum was completed shortly before Adams' departure. Later life Secretary Adams and his wife Adams retired from the Smithsonian after ten years of service in 1994 and returned to academia as an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego. He received a Distinguished Service Award from the Society for American Archaeology in 1996 and continued his fieldwork and research in the archaeology and anthropology of the Middle East. Scholarly research Robert McCormick Adams has had a wide-ranging career spanning many fields. Geographically, his interests have involved extensive fieldwork in the Middle East, but have also included Mexico. With a broadly interdisciplinary approach, he has studied the course of development of urban civilizations over many millennia, and he has also dealt with the history of technology. Partly as an outgrowth of decades of experience in Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia, he has until recently been involved in studies of multiethnic violence under the joint sponsorship of the US National Academy of Sciences and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Over the course of his career Adams has emphasized the importance of social interaction and cultural ecology in the evolution of civilizations. His research has explored how cultural ecology can help explain the rise of civilizations and how cultures affect each other. Adams has proposed, based on his excavations in Mesopotamia, that there was no single condition behind the complex societies of ancient cities and states; they were a product of numerous interrelated conditions, especially social organization and craft specialization. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957. Adams received the Gold Medal Award for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement in 2002 from the Archaeological Institute of America.

The species was once found throughout the Auckland Islands but is now restricted to the islands that lack introduced predators: Adams Island, Enderby Island, Disappointment Island and a few smaller islands. An old report of \\"the same flightless duck\\" on North East Island, The Snares group most likely refers to a straggler. The Auckland teal is smaller and rarer than the brown teal of the main islands of New Zealand, a species with which it was once considered conspecific. The plumage is all over brown with a hint of green on the neck and a conspicuous white eyering. The female is slightly darker than the male. The wings are very small and the species has, like the related Campbell teal, lost the power of flight. The Auckland teal is mostly crepuscular to nocturnal, preferring to hide from predators (New Zealand falcons and skuas) during the day. The species inhabits a variety of habitats with the islands, including tussock fields, megaherb shrubland and coastal waters. It is carnivorous for the most part, feeding on marine invertebrates, insects, amphipods and other small Invertebrates. Auckland teal are territorial and seldom form flocks.

Biography =Early years= Whitman Blount Mayo, Jr. was born in New York City and grew up in Harlem and later Queens. At the age of 17, he moved with his family to Southern California and from there entered the United States Army, serving from 1951 to 1953 during the Korean War. Upon release, he studied at Chaffey College, Los Angeles City College, and UCLA. During this time, he began acting in small parts, while waiting tables and working in the vineyards and as a probation officer, as well as a variety of other small jobs. He also spent seven years as a counselor to delinquent boys. =Career= In the early 1970s, while working for the New Lafayette Theatre, Norman Lear offered Mayo a role as Grady Wilson on Sanford and Son. The character's name was based on Demond Wilson, the actor who played Lamont Sanford and whose real first name is Grady. During a period where Redd Foxx did not appear on the show due to a contract dispute, Grady moved into the Sanford house and effectively starred in the show for six episodes. Mayo later starred in Grady, an unsuccessful spin-off in which his character moved in with his daughter and her husband in Beverly Hills. After its cancellation in 1976, Mayo's Grady character returned to Sanford and Son. Mayo reprised the role in the unsuccessful 1977 NBC-TV spinoff series Sanford Arms with actor Theodore Wilson, and for two episodes of Sanford, another spinoff of Sanford and Son, this time with Redd Foxx and actor Dennis Burkley, in 1981. Also in the late 1970s, Mayo appeared on the Los Angeles children's television program That's Cat, offering sage advice in a sweet manner to the main character Alice. In 1990, he appeared in an episode of In the Heat of the Night titled \\"Hello in There\\". In 1991, he appeared in an episode of Full House titled \\"The Volunteer\\". He played a senior named Eddie Johnson with Alzheimer's. In 1996, Late Night with Conan O'Brien spent several weeks trying to have Mayo appear on the show. Conan even went as far to set up the \\"Grady Hotline\\", a 1‚Äì800 number where viewers could call in with any Grady \\"sightings\\". The show also aired a mock episode of Unsolved Mysteries. On February 8, 1996, Mayo appeared on Late Night to much fanfare. In 1997, he guest-starred in the Nickelodeon sitcom Kenan and Kel, playing Kenan and Kyra's rude, impatient Uncle Raymond. Mayo also played a role in The Cape as Sweets, the owner of Moonshot Bar and Grill. Mayo made several film appearances, including The Main Event with Barbra Streisand, D.C. Cab, Boyz n the Hood, and Waterproof with Burt Reynolds. Mayo also appeared as Reverend Banyon on the BET TV Movie Boycott in 2001 and in an episode of Martin. He hosted Liars and Legends on Turner South. He also made appearances in Sesame Street. Mayo taught drama at Clark Atlanta University. He opened a travel agency in Inglewood, California. =Death= Mayo died of a heart attack on May 22, 2001 at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital. He had resided in Atlanta's Collier Heights community since 1994 with Gail Mayo, his third wife. His son Rahn Mayo became a member of the Georgia House of Representatives in 2009.

His American debut was in November 1952, with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Eugene Ormandy, and his American recital debut took place in 1956, at New York's Carnegie Hall. As a Lieder singer, he was a gifted interpreter of Schubert, including his song-cycles Die sch√∂ne M√ºllerin and Die Winterreise and the collection of songs Schwanengesang, as well as of Robert Schumann, Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler. He also appeared frequently as a soloist in Bach's Passions and Brahms' A German Requiem. Biography Hermann Prey was born in Berlin and grew up in Germany. He was scheduled to be drafted when World War II ended. He studied voice at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin and won the prize of the Frankfurt contest of the Hessischer Rundfunk in 1952. He began to sing in song recitals and made his operatic debut the next year with the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden in Bad Salzschlirf (Moruccio in Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland). He joined Hamburg State Opera's resident company, where he sang until 1960. During his last years in Hamburg, he also made frequent guest appearances elsewhere, including the Salzburg Festival. He sang frequently at the Metropolitan Opera between 1960 and 1970 (and as late as the early 1990s), and made his Bayreuth debut in 1965 as Wolfram (Tannh√§user), returning there 1966‚Äì67, 1981‚Äì84 and 1986. Although he often sang Verdi early in his career, he later concentrated more on Mozart and Richard Strauss. Prey was well known for playing Figaro (Mozart and Rossini), but he played other Mozart roles at least equally often, particularly Papageno and Guglielmo. He also played, and recorded, the Count in The Marriage of Figaro, and occasionally performed as Don Giovanni.http://www.operone.de/opern/dongiovanni.html ; also see Wikipedia's Don Giovanni Discography He is regarded by some as the best Eisenstein (from Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss II) ever. He was at home with comic opera Italian-style, displaying scenic intelligence, liveliness and hilarity. His virtuoso agility and great comic acting made him an obvious choice for numerous productions of Mozart's and Rossini's operas in the 1970s. In 1972 he performed as Figaro in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's television film of Rossini's Il Barbiere di Siviglia with Teresa Berganza as Rosina, Luigi Alva as Almaviva and conductor Claudio Abbado. He appeared alongside Fritz Wunderlich and Hans Hotter in the live televised version of Il Barbiere di Siviglia in its German translation, Der Barbier von Sevilla. He also portrayed Figaro in 1976 in Ponnelle's film of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro. Prey also sang operetta and performed on German television, becoming extremely popular with television audiences. He shared media-celebrity with Fritz Wunderlich until the latter's untimely death, often playing Papageno to Wunderlich's Tamino. Prey possessed a clear, polished tone‚Äîdarker and deeper-sounding than his slightly older contemporary Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, but equally refined and equally capable of soaring into the tenor range without the smallest suggestion of vocal effort. He recorded a multi-volume set for Phillips, tracing the history of the Lied from the Minnes√§nger to the twentieth century. In addition, he released numerous recordings of opera and song. Unlike Fischer-Dieskau, Prey wisely limited his Wagner to the soft, high-baritone roles Wolfram and Beckmesser. He can be seen on video in the latter role, opposite Bernd Weikl. Starting in 1982, he taught at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hamburg, and he wrote an autobiography which was translated as First Night Fever: The Memoirs of Hermann Prey (). In 1988, he directed a production of The Marriage of Figaro in Salzburg. His son Florian is also a baritone. He died in Krailling, Bavaria. Pianists who accompanied Hermann Prey in recitals and/or recordings of Lied repertoire include Karl Engel, Gerald Moore, Wolfgang Sawallisch, Leonard Hokanson, Friedrich Gulda, J√∂rg Demus, Walter Klien and Michael Endres. In one of his last recordings of September 1997 at Herbstliche Musiktage Bad Urach he was accompanied by Florian Uhlig.
