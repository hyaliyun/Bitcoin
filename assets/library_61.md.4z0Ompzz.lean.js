Immersed in the social upheaval of the 1960s, he is best known for his iconic photographs of the counterculture, collected in his 1979 book Aquarian Odyssey: A Photographic Trip into the Sixties. Early life Don Snyder was raised on Coney Island, which left an imprint on his art and creativity. He acquired a camera at an early age and spent his teenage years photographing families clustered on rock jetties or cavorting among the crowded lawn chairs, beach blankets, sun umbrellas, and sand castles. The gaudy race-track horses of Steeplechase and the red billowing cloud of the Parachute Jump also captured his photographic imagination, as did the multiple freak shows and sideshow facades on which he was paid to paint mermaids and monsters. Still underage, Snyder began working in a narrow, cramped darkroom behind one of Coney Island‚Äôs ‚Äú5 for a dollar‚Äù photo stalls, where he learned to rapidly process and print photos while customers waited impatiently in the alley for their prints. From 1948 to 1962, he combed the beach and shot more than 24,000 black and white photos with out- of-date World War II military film that he bought from a Coney Island hawker for pennies on the dollar. These photos comprised his first photographic opus, which he called Coney Island Inferno. Ralph Ginzburg‚Äôs art magazine, Eros,Ginzberg, R. (Ed.) Eros (Vol. 1, No. 2, 1962). Cover photograph plus inside covers by Don Snyder featured Coney Island Inferno images in its second issue. Photographs from the Inferno series were exhibited at the Municipal Art Society of New York in 1987.Don Snyder and Nancy Rudolph, photographers, Coney Island Comeback, Municipal Art Society, June 4 - July 8, 1987. An exhibition co-sponsored by the New York City Parks Department and Parks Council; curated by Gerard Malanga. Snyder attended Syracuse University where he met and was influenced by the radical ideas of artist Aldo Tambellini, who was then a graduate student teaching in the art department. His creative alliance with Tambellini continued after Snyder left Syracuse to study painting and photography at Cooper Union and enroll in Alexey Brodovitch‚Äôs Design Laboratory at The New School. When Tambellini moved to Manhattan, Snyder joined his emerging Group Center, an artists‚Äô collective intent on challenging the hegemony of the art establishment Photography In the late 1950s, Snyder began working for the fashion and advertising photographer Alan Arbus, developing and printing commercial photographs in Arbus‚Äôs darkroom. There he met and formed a friendship with Diane Arbus. Although she had already quit working at the studio, she often stopped by with photos she had just made on the streets of New York, and Snyder developed the film and made prints for her in his spare time. They traded photographs, and he continued to make occasional prints for her after he left Alan Arbus‚Äôs employ.The Diane Arbus prints in Snyder‚Äôs archive, including some very early examples of her work, were catalogued by Lame Duck Books in 2014. They remained friends until her death in 1971. During this early period, Snyder worked as a high-fashion photographer, and multiple examples of his creative fashion photography were published in his first book, Don Snyder‚Äôs World of Photography, which illustrated his innovations in lighting and special effects. He sold photographs as record jacketsExamples of Snyder‚Äôs album covers. and book covers and they appeared in periodicals such as The Village Voice, the East Village Other, The New York Times, McCalls, Rolling Stone, Print Magazine, and Modern Photography, among others. He began receiving assignments from the prestigious hardcover quarterly Horizon and was sent to San Francisco in 1967 to photograph the emerging scene in Haight-Ashbury. A portfolio of Snyder‚Äôs portraits of flower children during the Summer of Love appeared in Horizon in 1968. Other Horizon portfolios followed, such as his portraits of prominent parapsychologists, including Montague Ullman and members of the Maimonides Dream telepathy Laboratory. When documenting the social turmoil of the 1960s and 1970s, Snyder made portraits of many countercultural figures‚Äì‚Äìamong them Abbie Hoffman, Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Lenore Kandel, Bobby Beausoleil, Allen Ginsberg, Yayoi Kusama, Arthur Kleps, Angus Maclise, Gerard Malanga, The Grateful Dead, and Janis Joplin. He captured the underground art scenes flourishing on both the East and West Coasts, and documented life in well- known countercultural communities. As one reviewer put it, \\"Look back on this era and you recall Woodstock, San Francisco‚Äôs Haight Ashbury, rock festivals, flower children, and the communes. In 1964, Snyder began an odyssey from coast to coast, capturing the mood in spectacular color. With camera in hand, he is just as much an artist as the man with the brush.\\" City life, with its club scenes and radical avant-garde art also drew Snyder‚Äôs attention. Using only available light, he made a series of photographs of The Living Theatre‚Äôs ‚ÄúParadise Now,‚Äù and Angus MacLise‚Äôs opera ‚ÄúOrfeo.‚ÄùAngus MacLise‚Äôs opera Orfeo was adapted by Sylvie Degiez for Hybrid Nights (No. 2) at The Kitchen on February 24, 1995. He spent many all-night stints in Ira Cohen‚Äôs Mylar Chamber, photographing countercultural figures such as William Burroughs and Jack Smith and teaching Cohen the art of photography. Photographs from these sessions appear in Aquarian Odyssey, which The New York Times called: ‚Äúa penetrating trip into the turbulent sixties in psychedelic color. This fascinating book is a basic primer for the street photographer interested in documenting life around him, and on what can be accomplished with a minimum of equipment and a maximum of imagination. It is a masterful treatise on shooting color in available light, revealing street candids, and a side-trip to fantasy land.‚Äù Multimedia Meanwhile, Snyder was experimenting with multimedia art forms. In the early 1960s, he made a series of sepia, black and white, and brilliantly colored x in. slide-glass paintings with aniline dyes that were projected on a screen or on various three-dimensional surfaces. Jonas Mekas wrote about them in The Village Voice: ‚ÄúIt is Don Snyder who is the Master of Slide Art. His slide photography merges completely with the medium of cinema, a kinesthetic experience of color and motion that should be judged not by the design of a single slide (frame) but by the patterns of visual impulses.‚Äù Snyder created elaborate multimedia shows in which his hand-painted slides were combined with dancers and experimental films. Howard Junker wrote in The Nation: ‚ÄúSnyder‚Äôs film plus slide show ‚ÄòEpiphany‚Äô beamed optically complex imagery onto translucent net screens dispersed by a moving wall of 3D projected and real white cubes in which black vinyl-clad dancers moved to disperse and fragment the 'magical' imagery. Many levels, very beautiful . . . the best of the festival.‚Äù In a multimedia collaboration with Angus MacLise, Snyder projected his slides on slowly spinning translucent disks of various sizes that were hung from the rafters of St. Peter‚Äôs Episcopal Church.As with St. Marks Church in-the-Bowerie, St. Peter‚Äôs Episcopal Church on West 20th Street made its premises available for artists‚Äô performances to further cultural awareness in the community. He created Spectro-Mach I for the expanded cinema festival at The Film-Makers' Cooperative,Don Snyder, Spectro- Mach I, Dec. 7 & 12, 1965, New Cinema Festival 1, Film-Maker‚Äôs Cinematheque. and staged multimedia shows at other public venues such as The Millennium Film WorkshopDon Snyder, Experimental Films, Millenium Film Workshop (May 3, 1970) and The Electric Circus. Snyder‚Äôs slides projected onto nudes were printed on an array of perforated stamps and included in issue No. 9 of the multimedia magazine, Aspen. His slide images formed the solar centers of Angus MacLise‚Äôs New World Solar Calendar (Fluxus Codex page 398). He was commissioned by Jean Houston and Bob Masters to create an altered-states multimedia chamber at their Foundation for Mind Research.The Foundation for Mind Research was established in New York City by Jean Houston and Bob Masters in 1967. It was later moved to Pomona, NY. The high-end fabric designer Jack Lenor Larsen reproduced a series of Snyder‚Äôs slides on innovative new fabrics, and Larsen presented the fabric line to fellow designers and members of the fashion industry in a multimedia light show created by Snyder. Slides chosen for the fabrics were projected on white-clad modern dancers as they undulated down the runway in the novel textures. Filmmaking In 1966, Snyder spearheaded a professional company of 5 artists called The Adventures of Multimedia. The group soon garnered media spreads in newspapers and prominent magazines, and it was featured in primetime TV shows on WNBC and WNET. The group received a commission from Paraphernalia to make a film promoting its trendy new clothing line. Directed by Snyder, the film featured high-fashion models in mini-skirts skiing down Vermont slopes at night in a phantasmagorical display of Snyder‚Äôs slides, special effects, and fireworks. The Grove Press Film Collection described the film as ‚Äúa Joycean delirium of colors and sounds. . . . This film produces an eerie and strikingly contemporary glimpse of Pop culture; a virtuoso blending of videos with audio.‚ÄùThe Grove Press Film Division Catalog, 1967. The film was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in 1967.PARA 1000, a film made for Paraphernalia by The Adventures of Multimedia was exhibited at MoMA during a special screening of avant-garde industrial films in 1967. During the 1960s and 1970s, Snyder made experimental films and collaborated with artists such as Shirley Clarke, who edited his kinescope video CHROMA, and Yayoi Kusama, filming her artistic orgies and other erotic ‚Äúhappenings.‚Äù He shot The Living Theatre; and collected hours of documentary footage at Timothy Leary‚Äôs Castalia Foundation in Millbrook. He was commissioned to make a feature-length film of experimental erotica for Maurice Girodias, which he shot in the Berkshires. His last known film was a documentary of Jack Smith starring in his original play, ‚ÄúSong for Rent.‚Äù The film was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in 2011 and is in the museum‚Äôs permanent collection.Song for Rent was shown during the Jack Smith film series in: To Save and Project: The Ninth MoMA International Festival of Film Preservation, 2011. Sculpture Sculpture was a medium Snyder also liked to work in. His works of sculpture were first exhibited at the LENA sculpture shows at St. Mark‚Äôs Church in-the-Bowery. His huge triplicate panels of the Apollo 11 moon landing were shown in the Queens Museum exhibition, Television‚Äôs Impact on Contemporary Art.The Queens Museum, Television‚Äôs Impact on Contemporary Art (September 13 - October 26, 1986), catalog p. 19 The Magic Circle Exhibition at the Bronx Museum of Art included Snyder‚Äôs polarized light boxBronx Museum of the Arts, Magic Circle Exhibition (February 9 - April 26, 1977). Timothy Leary and the Castalia Foundation In 1965, Snyder met and formed a close association with Timothy Leary, producing multimedia shows for Leary that reflected his psychedelic philosophy and ideas. During 1965-67, Snyder spent considerable time at the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York, filming and preparing multimedia audiovisuals they called ‚ÄúThe Psychedelic Moment‚Äù for Leary‚Äôs drug free weekend seminars and Fillmore East shows. Many intimate portraits of Leary and his family members were included in Aquarian Odyssey. Snyder‚Äôs iconic photograph depicting Leary as Christ ‚Äúsitting‚Äù on the water with his arms raised in crucifixion position was shot in Millbrook and appeared on the front page of The Village Voice in 1974. Teaching Snyder taught at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) from 1974-1980, passing along his innovative photographic expertise in courses such as: Lensless Photography, Photo-Rayograms, Secrets of Light, Multimedia Photography and Filmmaking, Experiments with Light, Special Effects Photography, Painting with Light, Light Graphics, Darkroom Graphics, After the Darkroom, and Introduction to the Spectrum of Light and Photography. Automobile accident and death Snyder‚Äôs professional career was cut short in the summer of 1980 when he was in a catastrophic automobile accident and suffered a major brain concussion and shattered hip. His head had to be cut from the roof of the car with the Jaws of Life. As a consequence of the accident, he was obliged to turn down photographic assignments and book offers, and forced to give up teaching. His recovery was slow and his injuries plagued him for the rest of his life. Although he pursued his creative endeavors, he became more reclusive and seldom left his studio in Chelsea. Snyder‚Äôs health gradually deteriorated and he died of a massive heart attack in his studio on August 29, 2010.

She is best known as a photographer whose work challenged stereotypical assumptions of Puerto Ricans in the United States. She was also an early member and instructor of En Foco, a non-profit organization that nurtures contemporary fine art and documentary photographers of diverse cultures.  Biography  Rivera was of Puerto Rican descent and was born in 1938 in The Bronx, New York. She attended the New School for Social Research and Apeiron Workshops in Millerton, New York. She was an activist, photographer and teacher. Her main focus was on photography and she was most active during the 1970s and 1980s. Her work was solely based on her neighborhood of the Bronx. She went on to be a part of the board of advisors for En Foco. Rivera became a curator and also ran a photography gallery.  Artworks  Rouge et Noir (Red and Black), 1977-1978, includes five colored photographs which depict bloody tampons inside a toilet bowl. Bowl Study, 1977-1978, is composed of four black and white photographs of her own feces. Both series depict different body fluids and a toilet bowl. Rivera's main focus in these series is on the female body. She photographed herself to reveal an intimate part of her body that is typically perceived as taboo by society and finds inappropriate to discuss publicly. She revisited this concept in the 1970s with self-portrait, a photograph that captures her crouching naked over a toilet bowl. In this particular piece, she is not focusing on the toilet, but on her naked body. Rivera's is most well known for her Nuyorican Portraits, 1978, a collection of black and white photographs of Puerto Ricans in her neighborhood. She asked individuals walking by her home if they were Puerto Ricans if they were, she invited them into her home and took their photo against a black backdrop. She used these photos to deconstruct the stereotypical image of Puerto Ricans and to highlight diversity, embrace their subjects' individuality and remove stigmatisation among the Puerto Rican community. Six pieces from this series were presented at the Yanke Stadium on December 14, 1989, in an exhibition titled Revelations: A Latino Portfolio. Subsequently, 36 of the fifty photographs were destroyed in studio fire. Woman and Child, 1979, is a black and white photograph of a woman and toddler sitting together in a bus or train. It was shown in the journal Heresies, in an issue that focused on the extent to which artwork by women artists challenges society's view of the female sex. Heresies concentrated on creating a dialogue between Rivera's work and the audience and aimed to build a new perception of female artists. Blizzard, 1980, is a gelatin silver print that depicts a person standing in a blizzard. Although the image is blurry, their smile is visible.

It is sometimes called Bloublommetjie or pers poublom in Afrikaans. Flowering occurs between May and October. It grows in Namibia and South Africa.  Description  Felicia namaquana is a glandular-hairy, robust, often strongly branching annual plant of up to high. The central branch is upright, but lateral branches start off outwards at base, bending upwards. The branches are thickly set with leaves, particularly near the base. The leaves are alternately arranged along the branches except for the basal pair, narrowly to broadly inverted lance-shaped, up to about long and 2‚Äì10 mm (0.08‚Äì0.4 in) wide, with a blunt tip, an entire margin, with one central vein, and a roughly and glandular hairy surface. The firm and large flower heads sit individually on top of an almost leafless, hairy stalk of up to long. The involucre is about across, and consisting of two strict rows of equally long bracts. Those in the outer row are about 1 mm (0.04 in) wide, lance-shaped, roughly and glandular hairy with a fringe of hairs near the tip. Those in the inner row narrowly obovate, 1 mm wide, with a broad papery margin and eventually hairless. Many female ray florets with a light blue, rarely yellow, strap, are long and 2 mm (0.1 in) wide, with a hairy tube. Many bisexual, softly hairy disc florets with a yellow corolla of about long. In the center of each corolla are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. At the tip of both style branches is a narrowly triangular appendage. Around the base of the corolla are many white pappus bristles with teeth, that are easily discarded. The dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are large, 3 mm (0.12 in) long and 1 mm (0.6 in) wide, inverted egg-shaped, yellowish brown to brown, with a strong marginal ridge, with thick, -1 mm (0.02‚Äì0.04 in) with short, robust hairs. Felicia namaquana is a diploid having five sets of homologue chromosomes (2n=10).  Taxonomy  Many scientific names have been given to this species because it is very variable. In 1865 William Henry Harvey, described both Aster namaquanus and Aster elongatus var. candollei. Karl August Otto Hoffmann described Felicia schenckii in 1898, J. Mattfeld added Felicia prageri in 1921, and Edwin Percy Phillips distinguished Susanna dinteri in 1950, all of them honoring the collector of the specimens described. In 1960, Hermann Merxm√ºller reassigned Harvey's species and made the new combination Felicia namaquana. In 1973 J√ºrke Grau considered all of these name synonymous. The species is considered to be part of the section Neodetris.  Distribution  The pers poublom occurs in the wild from Namibia, through Bushmanland and Namaqualand, via Hantam to Worcester and extends eastwards into the Great Karoo. It grows on sandy or gravelly plains.  Conservation  The continued survival of Felicia namaquana is considered to be of least concern because the population is stable.

She had a previous career as a journalist and writer, particularly on military affairs. Career Chitral in summer Chitral map =Writing= After a degree in English at Clare College, Cambridge, in the late 1970s Schofield began working as a journalist, and wrote her first book, a lively biography of the French gangster Jacques Mesrine. This was followed by \\"a coolheaded, slickly written account\\" of the life of Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones. From rock biography she went on to military affairs, publishing two books on the Soviet Army. With the support of the President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf, Schofield spent five years embedded with the Pakistan Armed Forces, interviewing all ranks for Inside the Pakistan Army (2011) One of her informants was Special Forces commander Ameer Faisal Alavi, assassinated in 2008. During these years, she reported for the Sunday Times. =Langlands College= Although she had experience as a state school governor in Britain, she had never taught for a living before taking on the challenge of leading Langlands School and College, in North-west Pakistan. The school, despite its remote location (in Chitral in the Hindu Kush mountains), had developed a reputation for academic excellence, sending its students on to national and international universities. The man it was named for - and its head for almost all of its existence - was Major Geoffrey Langlands, a legend in Pakistani education, having taught many of the country's elite. He was in his 90s, and Schofield was brought in to help recruit his successor, but instead was offered the job herself. He described her as \\"extraordinary\\", not least because she was unafraid of the security situation, which had frightened away several candidates. Aaj News interviewed her shortly after her appointment: :Miss Schofield has forsaken her home near London‚Äôs fashionable Sloane Square for a mountain fastness. So why, at the age of 59, has she abandoned an enviable lifestyle in Britain to come here? ‚ÄúBecause it would be nice to make a difference,‚Äù she says, speaking for the first time about her new job. ‚ÄúIt is good in middle age to be able to do something useful. The College and its associated primary schools educate a thousand pupils. If we can turn them around it will improve a thousand young lives. The job is daunting but worth doing.‚Äù And the Taliban? ‚ÄúChitral is safer than Chelsea [a prosperous area of central London]. [...] The risk is very slight.‚Äù In the years following the Major's stroke, his ability to manage the school had declined, and Schofield had some hard decisions to take at the beginning of her tenure; she described the school as being \\"in a parlous state\\". She sacked seven members of staff (including the vice-principal) for \\"conduct unbecoming\\", which led to plotting against her; while she was out of the country, her work visa was denied, leaving her unable to return. Her enforced absence coincided with the October 2015 Hindu Kush earthquake and exceptionally bad flooding in the region, which complicated matters as she tried to run the school from her kitchen table in London. The Board of Governors respected her efforts to turn the school around, and following lobbying by her staff, after eight months Schofield was allowed to return. She has improved discipline and finances. Her innovations at the school, where all lessons are in English, include appointing a learning support coordinator for pupils with dyslexia and dyspraxia, and \\"working to strengthen contacts with leading schools and educationists from across the world\\". In the 2019 New Year Honours, she was awarded an OBE for \\"services to education and the community in northern Pakistan\\". Works * Mesrine - The Life and Death of a Supercrook.

He has also directed the films In the Kingdom of the Blind, the Man with One Eye Is King, Choker and Stiletto, and co-wrote the screenplay to Deadfall. Life and career Vallelonga was born in 1959, the son of Tony and Dolores Vallelonga.

While continuing his acting career, he continued to write and direct various independent films, such as A Brilliant Disguise, The Corporate Ladder, Choker, Stiletto, and Yellow Rock. Vallelonga achieved prominence with Green Book, which he co-wrote and produced. Based on the friendship of his father and Don Shirley, Green Book was critically praised and received dozens of award nominations, although the film was not without controversy, as Shirley's family accused Vallelonga of falsifying information in the movie. In Variety, Vallelonga disputed the allegations: \\"There's a lot of information [the Shirley family] doesn't have, and they were hurt that I didn't speak to them.

Early life Troy was born on December 21, 1916 in Rockland, Massachusetts. He worked his way through school and graduated from Boston College in 1939. During World War II he served as a combat officer in the United States Navy. After the war he moved to Washington D.C., where he attended Georgetown Law School and was an officer with the United States Capitol Police. After graduation he moved to Boston, where he operated a private law practice and was a legal counsel for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Troy was an unsuccessful candidate for Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth 1948, Boston City Council in 1950, and the Boston School Committee in 1951. From 1959 to 1961 he served as First Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth under Joseph D. Ward. In 1960 he served as chairman of Ward's unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Massachusetts. Judicial career On December 27, 1962, Troy was appointed presiding Judge of the Dorchester District Court by Governor John Volpe four minutes before the outgoing Governor's deadline for nominations. Volpe's appointment of his previous Democratic opponent's campaign manager was seen as a move to appease the Democratic members of the Massachusetts Governor's Council, specifically Patrick J. McDonough. =Complaints from The People First= In 1971, The People First, a Dorchester community group, began a drive to remove Troy from the bench. On February 4, 1972, Judge United States District Court ruled that Troy's practice of ordering female welfare recipients to swear out non-support complaints against their husbands or fathers of their children was \\"coercive and intimidating\\" and denied the men due process under the 14th Amendment by putting them on trial. That same year, a three judge panel found that Troy showed discrimination against persons involved in non-support and illegitimacy cases, held defendants in jail without bail in cases that \\"did not warrant this result\\", issued bails in a number of cases that were \\"clearly excessive\\", gave \\"frequently excessive\\" suspended sentences, failed to advise defendants of their right to counsel, failed to notify defendants of their right to obtain an immediate review of their bail order, and that his court did not have a \\"reliable, consistent\\" record keeping system that contained \\"irregular entries...made long after the fact and for some self-serving purpose\\". The panel recommended that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court appoint a special administrator to take over management of the Dorchester District Court, but did not recommend any discipline against Troy. =Real estate dealings= In April 1973, The Boston Globe published their report of a month long investigation into Troy's business dealings. They found that he had sat in judgement on a case involving men he had a business relationship with, assigned business associates to represent indigent defendants instead of public defenders, decided cases where one side was represented by a lawyer he had a business relationship with, and had profited from a real estate transaction by dubiously claiming non-profit status. They also found that he was director of a New Hampshire firm led by George Kattar, a businessman who had links to Raymond L. S. Patriarca, head of the Patriarca crime family. In 1968, Troy purchased a 23-acre parcel of land in Dorchester. He planned to construct a marina and resort hotel on the waterfront property. Soon thereafter the Massachusetts General Court approved $178,000 for a sewer extension to the property, however public outcry led to the appropriation being canceled. His building permit required that he build an enclosure and use \\"earth and rock free of wood or organic material\\" to fill the tidewaters, but instead he used construction debris which contained wood. He also failed to pay the fee to fill in the tidewaters. On May 1, 1970, Troy was found to have illegally filled 20 acres of wetlands with timber debris and his permit was revoked. On August 12, 1974 was ordered to remove the landfill. On June 30, 1975, Troy was found in contempt of court for failing to remove the fill. In 1980, Troy was found by the Massachusetts Attorney General's office to not have enough money to comply with the court order and was deemed \\"judgment- proof\\". In 1982, Troy agreed to give part of the land to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In exchange, Troy's $44,000 fine was forgiven. The rest of the site was donated to the Commonwealth in 1985. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection removed the toxic waste from the fill and the Metropolitan District Commission developed the land into a park. The park was opened to the public in 1988 as Victory Road Park. =Removal= On November 2, 1972, the Boston Bar Association filed charges against Troy based on complaints from The People First. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court appointed attorneys James D. St. Clair and Raymond Young to investigate the complaints against Troy. On July 26, 1973 the Court found that Troy had lied under oath while answering questions in a lawsuit brought by an insurance company following his wife's death, pressured an attorney into making a political contribution to Francis X. Bellotti, \\"willfully directed the filling of Tenean Creek in an illegal manner\\" and subsequently lied during his testimony in a suit brought against him for the filling, had a court officer work on his marina project during court hours, and obtained free legal services from attorneys who practiced in his court. The Court ordered that Troy be disbarred and enjoined from sitting as a judge. The Massachusetts General Court approved a petition calling for Troy's removal and on November 8, 1973, the Massachusetts Governor's Council voted 7 to 1 to remove Troy from the bench, with the ninth member, Patrick J. McDonough, abstaining due to his friendship with Troy. On November 1, 1974 his disbarment was upheld by the US Court of Appeals. Personal life Troy's first wife, College, died on July 22, 1965 at the age of 47. On February 22, 1966 he married Mary Lynn Hays. They had one daughter. In 1969 Troy and his family moved from South Boston to a 12-acre estate in Marshfield, Massachusetts. In 1980, Troy was reported to still be living on his estate in Marshfield, which had a swimming pool, tennis court, sheep, and a pony. He held no regular job but assisted his wife, who worked as a real estate agent. He took many trips to Ireland and wanted to move there, but his wife objected. Troy died on August 25, 2011 in Marshfield.

Early life Offley was baptized on 14 November 1682, the second son of John Offley of Madeley, Staffordshire and his wife Anne Crewe, daughter of John Crewe of Crewe Hall, Cheshire. In 1698, he succeeded his mother to Wychnor, and in 1711 to some of the estates of his great-uncle Sir John Crewe of Utkinton. He married Margaret Lawrence, daughter of Sir Thomas Lawrence of Chelsea, Middlesex on 2 May 1710. Career Offley's family held a significant electoral interest in Cheshire. At the 1705 general election Offley's elder brother John Crewe Offley decided to stand for Cheshire allowing Offley to stand at Newcastle-under-Lyme on the family interest Although defeated at the polls, he was seated on petition on 27 February 1706, together with his Whig partner, John Lawton, after proving bribery and other illegal practices byt their Tory opponents. Before he took his seat he was listed on 18 February 1706 as a supporter of the Court over the ‚Äòplace clauses‚Äô of the regency bill. At the 1708 general election at Newcastle-under-Lyme the previous contest was repeated. Offley and his partner Lawton were defeated in the poll, and then seated on petition on 1 February 1709. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatines and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. The Cheshire Whigs looked to him to present their address criticizing the doctor's conduct in July 1710. Probably in consequence, given the public support for Sacheverell, he decided not take part at the Newcastle election in 1710 He was appointed a Gentleman of the privy chamber in July 1714, shortly before Queen Anne's death, and retained the post for the rest of his life. Offley stood as a Whig again for Newcastle- under-Lyme at the 1715 general election, and was returned on petition for the third time on 2 June 1715. He voted for the septennial bill in 1716. He also voted against the government on the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts in 1719, but for them on the Peerage Bill. At the 1722 general election, he was returned instead as MP for Bewdley by Henry Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury. He was returned there again at the 1727 general election. He voted with the Administration until the 1734 general election, when he was defeated. Death and legacy Offley died on 28 June 1739 leaving two sons. His son John inherited Wychnor and sold it in 1765 to John Levett.

Early life Olivia was born at the country estate of her grandfather along the East River in New York City (near what is now 31st Street) on January 11, 1847. She was the second daughter ten children born to Caroline (n√©e Phelps) Stokes (1812‚Äì1881) and her father James Boulter Stokes (1804‚Äì1881), a partner in the mercantile business of Phelps, Dodge & Co. Among her siblings was banker Anson Phelps Stokes, real estate developer William Earl Dodge Stokes, and fellow philanthropist Caroline Phelps Stokes. She grew up at her parents house on the East River until they moved with her family to 37 Madison Avenue. The family was raised Presbyterian, but Olivia joined the Episcopal Church later in her life. Her maternal grandfather was Anson Greene Phelps, was a New York merchant and the namesake of Ansonia, Connecticut, who was descended from an old Massachusetts family. Through her mother, she was a descendant of three colonial governors, Thomas Dudley of Massachusetts, John Haynes and George Wyllys of Connecticut. Among her large, and prominent, family members were uncle U.S. Representative William E. Dodge, and cousins, Edward Stiles Stokes and Grace Hoadley Dodge. Philanthropy Olivia's parents died within months of each other in 1881, leaving an estate worth several million dollars to their seven children. However, the will was contested by her sister Dora, and, therefore, the money was not distributed until 1888. Olivia retained the family home at 37 Madison Avenue lived there with her younger sister, Caroline, until the building was redeveloped in 1902. Together, with her sister Caroline, Olivia worked together on many charitable projects such as the St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University, Woodbridge Hall at Yale (part of the Hewitt Quadrangle), and the Haynes Memorial Gates at Hartford First Church Cemetery. Several of the buildings they funded were designed by their nephew, Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, who was a partner in the architectural firm of Howells & Stokes. At the Tuskegee Institute, founded by Booker T. Washington, they funded bathhouses, a chapel, the Dorothy Hall training building, and entrance gates, working with architect Robert Robinson Taylor. The institute provided vocational training and many of the buildings were constructed by the students. Other works supported by the sisters for African American students were at Hampton Institute in Virginia (today Hampton University), the Calhoun School in Alabama, and Berea College in Kentucky. After her sister's death in 1909, Olivia continued their charitable works and acted as a trustee of the Phelps Stokes Fund that focused on providing housing and education for African Americans, Native Americans and needy and deserving white students. In 1915, Olivia had two model tenements built in New York City. She also wrote several books, including Pine and Cedar: Bible Verses (1885), Forward in the Better Life (1915), Saturday Night Thoughts in Lent (1922), and Letters and Memories of Susan and Anna Bartlett Warner (1925). =Society life= In 1892, Stokes was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. In 1914, Olivia bought a mansion in The Berkshires called Underledge located in Lenox, Massachusetts. Personal life Olivia, like her sister Caroline, never married.

After the Northern Expedition's official end in 1928, many defeated warlord troops had been integrated into the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). One regiment that had previously served under warlord Zhang Zongchang had remained loyal to its old commander, however, and rebelled on his orders. Though the mutineers captured the Yonghe Temple and threw Beijing into chaos, their revolt was quickly suppressed.  Background  NRA soldiers in Beijing in 1931 Following a long period of internal chaos and civil war known as the Warlord Era, China was forcibly reunified in the Kuomintang-led Northern Expedition (1926‚Äì1928). A new Nationalist government was established in Nanjing, and the warlord armies that had been defeated during the expedition were either disbanded or absorbed into the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). This reunification was only superficially successful, however, as much of the country remained under the control of warlords who had joined the NRA during the Northern Expedition instead of resisting. Beijing and its surroundings were among the areas that were not truly controlled by the Nationalist government; instead, they were ruled by Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan. Furthermore, the warlords that had been actually been ousted by the NRA continued to plot their return to power. One of these was Zhang Zongchang who launched a rebellion in his old fief of Shandong in January 1929. Though he primarily wanted to regain his former territories, Zhang also attempted to rally other warlords to launch a wider anti-Kuomintang in northern China. In this he was probably supported by Japan which provide him with ample funds to raise armies and bribe NRA troops to defect. In February 1929, Zhang claimed that a coalition of warlords, including himself, Chu Yupu, Yan Xishan, Wu Peifu, Bai Chongxi, Qi Xieyuan, and a number Manchurian military commanders were preparing for a massive campaign against the Nationalist government. No actual alliance was formed, however, and the \\"whole affair died down again, as suddenly as it had started\\". On the other side, many ordinary soldiers who had formerly been employed by Zhang found his offers highly attractive. Many members of Zhang's Shandong Army had been demobilized after the Northern Expedition and fallen into poverty. Others had been able to join the NRA, but were not paid well, and thus ready to defect to their old commander in return for financial rewards. One dissatisfied NRA regiment whose troops were of \\"northern origin\\" and had formerly been part of the Shandong Army, was stationed at the Yonghe Temple in Beijing. At some point, Zhang reportedly contacted this unit, and ordered them to prepare a revolt, which they did. It was later believed that this was part of his plot to regain power in northern China.  Revolt  The Yonghe Temple (photo from 1860) which the mutineers used as base during the revolt The revolt was launched on 2 March 1929, when 20 armed men in plain-clothes captured and disarmed the Shanxi Army guards of the Yonghe Temple. The men then fired in the air. This was the sign for the Zhang-loyal regiment to mutiny. The rebel soldiers quickly manned the temple's walls, barricaded themselves, and then also took control of the nearby city fortifications. From this cover they started to shoot at the civilians on the streets, causing great panic among the locals. Business and traffic in western Beijing were brought to a standstill. The government authorities reacted quickly upon being informed of the revolt, and sent loyal troops to quell the uprising. These loyalists surrounded and isolated the mutineers at the Yonghe Temple, and forced them to surrender after a short fight. Though the number of casualties among the civilians and loyalists remained unclear, two mutineers were killed and 35 wounded. The NRA cordoned the area around the temple, and managed to capture all surviving rebels. Having disarmed it, the mutinous regiment was imprisoned at the former Winter Palace.  Aftermath  The revolt received international attention, with newspapers in Australia, the Straits Settlements, and United States reporting on it, and commending the local authorities for having acted so quick and decisive in quelling the uprising. The Chinese government declared martial law in Beijing after the revolt, and took \\"precautions\\" to keep control of the other ex-Shandong Army troops in the NRA. Zhang Zongchang's rebellion in Shandong continued until May 1929, but was defeated by loyalist NRA forces. Thereafter, Zhang's career was finished as military leader and political strongman. After a few years in exile, he returned to Shandong in 1932 and was promptly murdered.

Description  Each entourage was divided into lots of seven animals, each in the care of a man who controlled them through shouts and whistles. Each animal carried about 120 kilograms and went as far as 3,000 kilometers. In addition to its important role in the economy, the tropeiro had important cultural importance as a vehicle for ideas and news between villages and communities that were distant from each other, at a time when there were no roads in Brazil. Along the routes they traveled, they helped to sprout several of today's cities in Brazil. The cities of Taubat√©, Sorocaba, Santana de Parna√≠ba and S√£o Vicente in S√£o Paulo, Viam√£o and Cruz Alta in Rio Grande do Sul and Castro in Paran√° are some of the pioneer cities that stood out for the activity of their tropeiros.  Trading  Tropeiro Paulista e Pedinch√£o de Esmolas, by Henrique Manzo Before the railways, and long before the trucks, the merchandise trade was done by tropeiros in the regions where there were no alternatives of maritime navigation or Waterway for its distribution. The interior regions, far from the coast, depended for a long time on this means of transport by mules. From the end of the seventeenth century, Minas Gerais, for example, demanded the formation of groups of merchants in the interior trade. Initially called men of the way, traffickers or passers-by, the tropeiros became fundamental in the trade of slaves, food and tools of the miners. Far from being specialized merchants, the tropeiros bought and sold of everything a little: slaves, tools, clothes, etc. The existence of the tropeirismo was closely related to the coming and going by the roads and roads, with emphasis to the Estrada Real ‚Äî route by which the gold miners arrived at the port of Rio de Janeiro and followed to Portugal. The constant movement of the troops not only made commerce possible but also became a key element in the economic reproduction of Tropeirismo. The tropeiros transported a wide variety of goods such as brown sugar, aguardiente, vinegar, wine, olive oil, cod, dried fish, cheese, butter, biscuit, raisins, flour, ginger, soap, dried fruit, chorizo, salami, kitchenware, marmalade, coconut, dried meat, cotton, salt, window glass, etc.Cavalcante, Messias Soares.

Products included cast ironware, steam engines and agricultural machines. He was a member of Copenhagen City Council from 1868 to 1885 and president of Industriforeningen from 1871 to 1876. Early life Heegaard was born in Copenhagen, the son of Mathias Anker Heegaard (1776‚Äì1837) and Henrikke Baggine Heegaard n√©e Hornemann (1780‚Äì1849). His father was the owner of a hardware store and in 1828 also established a small iron foundry in N√∏rrebro. Aftyer his confirmation, Heegaard became an apprentice in his father's hardware store. He also attended Det von Westenske Institut in N√∏rregade. Career Heegaard's iron foundry at Bl√•g√•rds Plads in 1890 Heegaard and his elder brother Christian August Heegaard (1810‚Äì79) continued their father's business after his death in 1837.

It gradually developed into one of the largest of its kind in the country, In 1857, he acquired Frederick's Works in Frederiksv√¶rk inn auction for 188,000 Danish rigsdaler from the government. He installed a steam engine and constructed a harbor at the site. That same year he also acquired a ceramic manufactory in Bl√•g√•rdsgade in Copenhagen which specialized in salt-glazed pipes. The site was then converted into an iron foundry. The company constructed a new head office and storage facilities at Havnegade 37 in 1870. A wide selection of its products, from enameled pots and other kitchenware to machines, was featured on the 1972 Nordic Exhibition.

Her work is distinguished by \\"a precise, hard-edge quality encompassing geometric lines and smooth surfaces in pieces that often defy categorization as abstract or figurative.\\"  Early life and education  Pimentel was born in 1943. Her father died when she was 12 years old. She began painting around the age of 20. In 1964, she began studying art at the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro as a student of Ivan Serpa, one of the pioneers of constructivism in Brazil during the 1950s. Serpa founded and led Grupo Frente alongside Lygia Clark, Helio Oiticica, and Franz Weissman. He was known for his rigorous geometric abstractions. Under his influence, Pimentel developed her plain constructivist spatial organization as well as her consistent use of precise and straight lines in her artworks. Her smooth brushwork was inspired by the neofiguration period. During the 1960s, she experimented with different styles, such as pop art in the United States and England, nouveau r√©alisme in France, and neofiguration and new objectivity in Brazil.  Selected artworks  = Sem T√≠tulo (Untitled), from the series Envolvimento (1968) = Medium: Vinyl paint on canvas Dimensions: 115.2 X 88.9 CM Wanda Pimentel primarily uses four colors in this painting: red, green, white, and yellow. There are two fragmented female legs as well as everyday objects. These include two chairs, a hair dryer, and an open purse which includes the following: a hair comb, lipstick, several bobby pins, a toothbrush, nail polish, and hair spray. They all appear to be in an indoor setting. There is a dual relationship represented in this painting: \\"it might seem that a young woman is simply making use of the world of objects, but at the same time the female body is objectified.\\" = Abstrato Verde (Green Abstract), from the series Envolvimento (1969)= Medium: Acrylic on canvas Dimensions: 116 X 89 CM In this painting, Wanda Pimentel uses two primary colors: green and red. There is a fragmented bare foot on a table in this painting as well as another table with kettles on it. The female appears to be in the kitchen, a place traditionally dominated by women. The way the female's foot is positioned suggests that she is merely watching as chaos ensues in the kitchen. The title of the artwork may be intended as subtle irony since Pimentel was never concerned with distinguishing figuration from abstractionism. = Sem T√≠tulo, 1970 = Medium: Vinyl on wood Dimensions: 30 X 144 X 77 CM Continuing the theme of fragmentation, Wanda Pimentel uses wood pieces to represent fragments of urban life. This is one of Pimentel's experiments with using three- dimensional art to extend the range of geometric lines and indefinite spaces. This piece goes up three steps and is colored gray and black. Art critic Frederico Morais wrote in 1979: > Wanda started running through the spaces of the house ‚Äì bedrooms, bathroom, > kitchen, living room ‚Äî portraying in them objects that, soon, were seen as > if from inside, radiographed or dissected: drawers, archives, falling > plaster on the wall. And as if anticipating her contact with the outer > world, she began to portray objects that also were means of communication: > telephone, television, photographic cameras. And between timid and > frightened, she one day opened the door to the street. Before, in a formal > level, she had already moved from canvas to reliefs, cutting out of the very > support the shape of the portrayed objects, thus arriving at the > construction of \\"objects\\": door with doormats, staircases, corners of rooms > and pieces of sidewalks, in which she introduces different kinds of > manholes.  Selected series  = Envolvimentos (1968‚Äì1984) = The Envolvimentos (Involvement) series, which includes 27 paintings, remains the most iconic series of Pimentel's work. It is primarily made up of pieces created during 1968 and 1969, but the work continued until 1984. This series was seen as the \\"clashing of two irreconcilable references: lines and abstract, geometric shapes as well as the desire to represent the contemporary and everyday world in transformation as it is experienced and perceived.\\" Wanda Pimentel questioned an \\"impersonal and mechanized world, in an epoch when mass media communications and the aesthetics of spectacle, embodied by television, had already declared victory over the silence of intimacy.\\" In the 1960s, art all around the world was used in mass media and consumer culture as well as in the women's rights movement. In 1968, Artur da Costa e Silva's military junta introduced the Institutional Act #5 (AI-5), which abolished the national legislature and prohibited every sort of political protest. In this context, Pimentel's Envolvimentos can be viewed as a subtle, yet critical, strike against the system. Wanda Pimentel used \\"rich colors and surgical precision\\" in her Envolvimento paintings which include fragmented female bodies in domestic environments. The body parts are mixed with the interiors geometric shapes and lines. Her paintings do not have shading. She used everyday objects, furniture, and utensils like shoes, teapots, umbrellas, etc. to surround the fragmented body parts of women. She does this as a critical response to the mores of consumer society and of the sexual repression and misogyny of Brazil's military dictatorship. To avoid censorship from the AI-5, Pimentel used partly nude body parts and regular household objects to conceal the political messages the art represents. = Geometria/Flor (2015) = The Geometria/Flor series was created as a celebration of all the work Pimentel has done since the 1960s. Although this series is completely new, some paintings contain elements such as geometric forms and stairs that echo previous works. Pimentel focuses on her own personal memories, in some of which she is searching for memories of her father. She uses the color gold extensively in this series as a reference to Baroque art and as a reminder to celebrate life. She uses flowers in this series as well as shades of white and red. The series also includes four works that Pimentel created in 1965 as a student of Ivan Serpa, which had never been shown previously. These drawings were made with a ballpoint pen and sheets of paper. While creating this series Pimentel came across a poem by Fernando Pesseoa called \\"O √öltimo Sortil√©gio\\" (\\"The Last Spell\\") that she included in her exhibition instead of a traditional critical text. Pimentel commented \\"The poem has a lot to do with these works. I wanted something sensitive, so I chose this poetry. Portuguese from Portugal is very dense, very beautiful when written. And my father was very fond of Fernando Pessoa\\".

At most times, these food materials are at a point of rotting. According to Salazar Simpson, her consistent use of this material was due to food being the most familiar because of her 7 years of marriage. Salazar Simpson shares her choosing in this material because it forces the viewer to smell and smelling fixates most into memory. Salazar Simpson describes her work as viscous, which was realized after having seen her daughters throwing eggs into the ground, searching for chicks.

Broadway was reaching its peak, classic theatre was working to be recognized, and the cinema business was growing as well. Within this decade, there were many changes within the social, economic, and legal environment in the United States, and these changes were often reflected into the art forms of the time period. In the 1920s, theatre utilized jazz, vaudeville, straight plays, musicals, and movies. Jazz A defining aspect of the performing arts within the 1920s was the development of jazz. Jazz was integrated into nearly every aspect of 1920s life: it was undefinable‚Äîit was music, it was a behavior, it was a style, it was scandalous, it was new, it was radical, it was an identity‚Äîultimately, it was everything. And it was credited with being the ‚Äúfirst distinctively American art form to disseminate US culture, style, and modernity across the globe. The ability that jazz had to spread across the globe also applied to spreading within American lives and art forms. During prohibition, ‚Äújazz cabarets and nightclubs would often stage elaborate floor shows that patrons could watch and participate in‚Äù and would even hire performers like comedians and actors in order to bring an ‚Äúadaption of Vaudeville comedy to the nightclub‚Äù. Performances were often used in clubs and speakeasies in order to hide the fact that people were flocking in for illegal alcohol, which led to the ‚Äúupgrade of entertainment into a small Vaudeville show‚Äù. Speakeasies, due to their highly theatrical and liberal atmosphere allowed for theatre to permeate every day behavior.  Theatrical practices  Other common theatrical practices, particularly in the early 1920s were musical revues, which had musical scenes and dramatic sketches and Vaudeville. But in the '20s, theatre is categorized into two main divisions: first, the ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù theatre, or classical theatre, were those who wanted America's theatre to be taken seriously. The other was the creation/propagation of the American musical comedy, or commercial theatre. Although musicals and Broadway had been created before, the 1920s were where this form of theatre reached its peak.  Vaudeville  Vaudeville Theater, Buffalo, NY Vaudeville in the 1920s was one of the largest forms of entertainment and was a rival to legitimate theatre. Vaudeville is a genre of theatre that encompassed a variety of entertainments and each act was unrelated to one another. Performers in Vaudeville specialized in one skill and repeated these skills at performances. Vaudeville was known for being more condensed in attempts to reaching out to the American middle class. Because of its theaters, affordable housing, receptive audience, and recreational activities, Los Angeles became a favorite city for vaudeville performers. This shift of theatre towards the West began the start of ‚Äúvaudeville only‚Äù theatres. Vaudeville became a large part of every community in the early twentieth century America. However, as the popularity of film grew, Vaudeville soon fell out of favor. Former Vaudeville stars, such as Charlie Chaplin and Burt Williams, followed the film route and became popular stars.  Legitimate and non-commercial theatre  The Legitimate Theatre category comprised mostly classic plays (i.e. Greek tragedies, Shakespeareans, etc...) and straight plays, usually in the style of realism. The ultimate goal was to get America's theatre practice seen as worthwhile and comparable to European theatre practices, and to be recognized as a viable center of dramatic art. The various institutions propagating the legitimization of American theatre included the Theatre Guild, The Civic Repertory Theatre, and various ‚Äúlittle theatres.\\" Of the many playwrights of this era, Eugene O‚ÄôNeill was both one of the biggest proponents for ‚Äúbringing American theatre to maturity‚Äù and was thus one of the most prolific and well known playwright of the time. In these early decades of the twentieth century, it was playwrights like O‚ÄôNeill that wanted to progress America's theatre into tackling real issues, like depersonalize (The Hairy Ape), drug abuse, alcoholism, family, unstable lifestyles, interracial marriage, the power of the mind, materialism, and sex equality. O‚ÄôNeill had grown up surrounded by what he saw as frivolous and charming theatre, but he wanted to delve into the meatier issues of life. Influenced by foreign playwrights like Strindberg and Ibsen, he wrote plays that he felt captured the essence of America in those days. In order to achieve these goals and write meaningful theatre pieces, he utilized expressionist and realist genres, and even adapted Greek tragedies to fit his needs. Some of his best known pieces are: The Iceman Cometh, Beyond the Horizon, Anna Christie, and his autobiographical masterpiece, Long Day‚Äôs Journey Into Night. = Processional = For the most part, legitimate theatre denounced improvisation and theatre that was only meant to bring amusement. O‚ÄôNeill is also credited with the first American-born tragedy. This play, entitled, Beyond the Horizon, was produced with one of the legitimate theatre companies of the time, known as ‚Äúlittle theatres,‚Äù‚Äîthe Provincetown Players. The plays that the Provincetown Players and other little theatres produced utilized realism and promulgated more complex characters that gave the American an opportunity to see a relatable figure on stage, rather than the stereotypical stock character they had traditionally seen. However, there were certain experimental plays, like Processional: A Jazz Symphony of American Life in Four Acts, by John Howard Lawson, that were appreciated by non commercial organizations like the Theatre Guild. Processional ‚Äúused jazz as a metaphor‚Äù and ‚Äúturned jazz into drama,‚Äù and through this piece, Lawson had tried to create theatre that, through jazz music, rhythm, color, and other elements, embodied the soul of America in that time. This piece starts with a coal striker going to jail and killing a guard in order to escape. He (the striker, named dynamite Jim) then tries to find refuge at his mother's house, until he finds out that she sold herself into prostitution when he was arrested in order to pay for his way out. Enraged, he assaults and impregnates an immature girl (Sadie Cohen) who wants to escape her own life and the oppression of the times. The coal mine owners promise a reward to the workers who come back, but really they just want to kill the leaders of the strike, the Ku Klux Klan blinds Jim, but he ends up with Sadie, who has now matured and ‚Äúfound faith in protecting her illegitimate child.\\" Processional mixes Vaudeville and jazz, and depends on Vaudeville ‚Äútype‚Äù characters to showcase the diversity and ‚Äúrange of humanity in America.\\" These stereotype characters represent ‚Äúthe oppressive power of authority,‚Äù ‚Äúthe impotence of complete idealism,‚Äù and ‚Äúsatirizing the confused rebellion of the younger generation.\\" It was these symbols, even though the play was not necessarily the best written or best performed, that got the Theatre Guild's approval. Lawson's Processional used Vaudeville and jazz styles to convey greater meanings about humanity, which was the meaning noncommercial theatre was striving for. The acceptance of Processional by the Guild though did not mean that jazz and noncommercial theatre were often put together‚Äîsince jazz was so free, radical, and new, many legitimate theatre proponents saw jazz as a threat to American theatre ever being taken seriously, but since jazz was so pervasive, jazz pieces were occasionally seen as transition music between scenes, even in realist and noncommercial plays.The primary goal of the legitimate theatre was ‚Äúto consecrate a literary theatre in America.\\"  Musical comedy and commercial theatre  = Broadway = Broadway, 1922 The twenties were a time of extreme growth for the musical and Broadway industry. Musical Comedies/musicals were considered ‚ÄúAll American‚Äù and were the biggest money makers in the industry. Musicals were considered ‚Äúcommercial theatre‚Äù for a reason‚Äîwith all the flashy lights, costumes, songs, and often scandalous stage behavior, many musicals were considered trivial and superficial, simply for entertainment and money making purposes. Despite this criticism, especially from the legitimate theatre world, this form of theatre reached its peak in the 1920s, during ‚Äúthe jazz age.‚Äù Jazz music and jazz culture were highly influential in the proliferation of musical comedies. ‚ÄúThe most popular theatrical entertainments of the period, vaudeville and musical comedy, quickly accommodated themselves to and literally cashed in on the new musical craze by using jazz as scoring or underscoring for songs, dances, and scenes.\\" Many musical comedies were of low-quality, and were more on the ‚Äúpurely commercial music‚Äù spectrum, but when composers/writers like Irving Berlin, Richard Rogers, Jerome Kern, and George Gershwin started making shows, that stereotype changed.  George Gershwin  George Gershwin (and his brother Ira who did mostly lyrics) were particularly influential. Born a Jewish- American, Gershwin became the most well known composer from the United States. Not only did he write musicals, but he wrote for Tin Pan Alley dabbled in concertos, radio jazz, and all sorts of compositions, even starting the genre of what we now know as ‚ÄúJewish jazz.\\" Gershwin did not use jazz just to make a profit, as other composers may or may not have done, he wrote jazz music for the stage and other arenas because jazz was ‚Äúthe soul of America,‚Äù and he did it well. Some of Gershwin's most well known/most accomplished shows include: Lady, Be Good and Tiptoes. Tiptoes in particular was Gershwin's third show to reach Broadway, running for 194 performances and then running successfully in London, and winning the praise of the ‚ÄúGershwins‚Äô best score.\\" In many ways, Tiptoes typifies the basis of musical comedies in the twenties as it highlights lovers, a glamorous setting, mistaken identities, New Yorkers, and ‚Äúsnappy songs,‚Äù but it also went further than that‚Äîit held images and messages of the struggles taking place in America. =Tiptoes= Tiptoes revolves around two couples in wealthy Florida. One of these couples is a pair of wealthy socialites, but the other is composed of a millionaire (Steve) and a Vaudeville performer pretending to be a rich aristocrat. The Vaudeville troupe had decided that they were going to find a millionaire for ‚ÄúTip Toes Kaye‚Äù (one of their members), and she and Steve fell in love at first sight. However, she suffers from amnesia after getting hit by a car, and then truly believes that she is the aristocrat she was previously pretending to be. Steve finds out and worries that she is a gold digger, so he pretends to have suddenly lost his fortune, but Tip Toes proves that she loves him, and there's a happily ever after. This piece, while highly typical of musical comedies in spectacle, also showcases the struggle of class systems in America. Steve and Tip Toes are from vastly different class and cultural boundaries, yet they engage in a successful romance. With this piece, the Gershwin's created something that was ‚Äúless typical -- and far more revealing of the struggles taking place in US theatre -- is the cross-class romance that is homologous to a series of binary oppositions, dramatic, characterological, musical, and lyric.\\" Tiptoes highlights and uses class differences in order to point out the disconnect, as well as using it to entertain. Productions like this led to Gershwin's quality being seen as partially Carnegie and legitimate level while also mixing with Vaudeville-esque and cabaret qualities. Show Boat, 1928 Another influential musical from this age was Show Boat. Written by Kern and Hammerstein, Show Boat started a new chapter in musicals. It got rid of the typical musical chorus line, showcased an interracial couple, touched on race issues, and other social issues. Most musical plot lines and stories were insubstantial and materialistic before shows like TipToes and Show Boat (and Oklahoma! In the 1940s) came around. These well written shows made many musicals fall into a category of their own‚Äînot quite legit, but not pure entertainment anymore either. However, there was still a high demand in the 20s for light and fun entertainment when it came to Broadway.  Cinema  In addition to live performance, Hollywood movies were also a key aspect of the 1920s theatrical experience. Although the first movie came out in the late 1800s, they, like Broadway, reached a peak in the 1920s. With over 20 studios by the end of the 1920s, the movie making industry released an average of 800 films a year during this decade, compared to today's average of 500. = Silent film = Newspaper ad for the American film The Valley of Silent Men (1922) Up until around 1927, all movies were silent. The actors were skilled in pantomime, gestures, and facial expressions, but no recorded talking or lines were included in the movies. The only words that signaled actions or lines to the viewer's were written on title cards. Title cards would pop up when important plot developments needed to be cleared up, or specific lines were supposed to be included. However, despite the lack of spoken word, there was often music and sound effects added after the fact. In order to add music into the movie experience, pianists, organists, or even orchestras would accompany the film. Because of this, American silent films were often able to be shown universally and the same story would be communicated to most audiences, despite their language. Another key feature of silent films was the speed‚Äîon average, the film reels were sped up quite a bit‚Äîusually by about four times the usual speed. This was done sometimes for no real reason, but sometimes in order to make time for a matinee as well as an evening show. = Silent film stars = Beauty was highly appreciated in this era of film, and the stars of the industry reflected that. Hollywood stars were seen as glamorous, however, despite the floating ideals of whiteness in America, many Hispanic men and women shared in this iconic era of beauty. In fact, the contribution of Hispanic Americans to the movie industry was highly important. For example, when Roman Novarro starred in MGM's production of Ben Hur: Tale of the Christ in 1925, the company was saved from bankruptcy due to his popularity and skill. Then, as the Silent Era was ending, actresses like Lupe Velez was popular and profitable enough that her career did not end with the era. Instead, her career continued with the talkies. However, even though they were successful in the film industry, most Hispanic actors were relegated to three main stereotypes on screen (although some were able to take on ‚Äúwhite‚Äù roles): the greaser, the Latin Lover, or the dark seductress (for women). Hollywood loved on-screen couple-ships as well‚Äîthey were marketable and romantic. One such couple, Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, starred together in 12 films and were dubbed ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Sweethearts.‚Äù = Talkies = The Jazz Singer (1927) The first film including synchronized sound and audible lines was The Jazz Singer in 1927. Many of the talking films in the twenties revolved around Broadway in plot and theme. For example, The Jazz Singer was about a boy who followed his dream of performing rather than working in church with his father. Many movies were less explicitly connected to Broadway and instead just had themes that visibly reminded the viewer of New York, and other such cues. In the very end of the decade, movie musicals were popular, especially in 1929, since they took special advantage of the addition of sound‚Äîsinging. Some prominent examples of movie musicals from this time were Broadway, Gold Diggers of Broadway, and, The Hollywood Revue of 1929. Most of the big film companies took advantage of the income increasing movie musicals until 1930, when they were deemed to expensive and impractical to continue mass-producing. = Issues with sound = When sound was first introduced, there were a number of complications. First of all, most of the famous actors from the Silent Era, who were primarily pantomimes, had untrained voices and were incapable of expressing the necessary emotions with the addition of words. This voice struggle led to the end of many previously successful acting careers. Some had voices that were not compatible with the microphones, some had voices that were too high, too husky, or too soft, and some simply could not act convincingly. Because of this, many companies began to hire a higher number of ‚Äútheatre‚Äù actors, who were familiar with using their voices. Along with actors, film studios began to hire playwrights to write scripts, as the new addition of lines was a struggle for some filmmakers. In fact, many of the first talking films were just filmed adaptations of previously existing stage plays. Additionally, movie studios had to spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on new sound equipment or soundproofing certain rooms. This new equipment, though innovative, was also difficult to work with at times. The mics were large and sensitive to movement, so they were typically placed strategically within props and set pieces that the actor would be next to during certain lines of dialogue, which was often difficult to work with. Moving the cameras also proved to be fairly noisy and got picked up on the recordings. To remedy this, many studios started practicing the ‚Äúfrozen camera‚Äù technique, where cameras were placed in a soundproof room and recorded through the glass, with a wide shot so it would not have to pan or move. This led to an effect similar to that of a stage play, just on a screen. = Main companies = Within the film industry, there were several main companies. Five of which were considered the ‚ÄúBig Five‚Äù and three were the ‚ÄúLittle Three.‚Äù Many of these companies exist still today. The Big Five consisted of Warner Brothers, Famous Players-Lasky Corporation ( became Paramount Studios, 1927), Radio-Keith-Orpheum Pictures, Marcus Loew of Loew's, Inc. (eventually Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), and Fox Film Corporation. The Little Three consisted of Universal Pictures, United Artists, and Columbia Pictures.

The design is sometimes confused with the 1983 Hunter 31 and the 2006 Hunter 31-2, which was also marketed as the Hunter 31. Production The design was built by Hunter Marine in the United States, starting in 2015 and remained in production through 2019. Design The Marlow-Hunter 31 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. The hull and deck and made from a vinyl ester resin with continuous reinforcement fibers, reinforced with Nida honeycomb cores and Kevlar in the forward hull for collision protection. It has a fractional sloop B&R; rig, a mainsheet traveler mounted on a stainless steel arch, a nearly plumb stem, a reverse transom with a fold-down swimming platform and folding ladder, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a laterally-tilting wheel and a fixed fin keel or shoal draft keel. With standard fin keel it displaces and carries of ballast, while the shoal draft model displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and with the optional shoal draft keel. The steering wheel can be set in port, center or starboard positions by use of a foot locking lever, as desired by the helmsman. This provides the advantages of a dual-wheel configuration, but occupies less cockpit space. The wheel also folds when not in use. The boat is fitted with a Yanmar 3YM20 diesel engine of , with a engine optional. A sail drive is also optional. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The holding tank has a capacity of . Factory standard equipment includes a teak interior, Corian countertops,microwave oven, refrigerator, freezer, two-burner propane stove and oven, fully enclosed head with separate shower, LED lighting, knotmeter, depth sounder. Headroom below decks is . A roller furling jib and mast-furling mainsail are optional. Operational history Writing for Sailing magazine in March 2015, famed yacht designer Robert Perry, was not impressed with the styling, describing this genre of boat \\"as looking like 'the box the boat came in.'\\" He describes the compromises, \\"It's not a bad trend if interior volume is what you are after. The new Marlow-Hunter 31 has an interior that would have been impressive even on a 40-footer 30 years ago. For a lot of buyers, interior comfort trumps performance. But in the hands of a skilled designer, performance can still be attained. Maybe not race boat performance, but respectable cruising boat performance is possible.\\" He concluded with faint praise for the design, \\"I think this would be a great boat to introduce a young family to the joys of sailing and cruising.\\" Sven Donaldson, writing in Pacific Yacht Magazine in May 2015, concluded, \\"For a sailboat that fits in a 32-foot slip, it‚Äôs hard to envision a more spacious, liveable package than the new MH-31. It‚Äôs not for everyone, of course. There will be some who prefer a stronger bias toward the sailing side of the equation. On the other hand, it‚Äôs certainly no slouch under sail.\\" Great Lakes Boating magazine published a review in the summer of 2015, saying, \\"The Marlow-Hunter 31 uses a well-proven hull design to rival most 34-foot models. The 30-foot foot waterline outclasses most boats, and when combined with her Henderson/Marlow chined hull, it offers off-shore stability and performance that few can match. At low angles of heel and as the wind freshens, the Marlow/Henderson hull provides superior stability and performance.\\" In a review in Canadian Yachting in May 2016, Simon Hill, praised the interior accommodations. Of the sailing qualities, he wrote, \\"When some breeze appeared it was easy to deploy the furling sails, and we were quickly able to get the boat moving at nearly three knots in wind that was topping out at about four knots, tacking upwind without difficulty despite the light conditions. The true test of a slippery hull form is how well it accelerates, and the MH 31 proved quick to build speed in even the slightest pull, and equally quick to respond to the helm.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Allmand 31 *Beneteau 31 *Catalina 310 *Corvette 31 *Douglas 31 *Herreshoff 31 *Hunter 31 *Hunter 310 *Hunter 320 *Niagara 31 *Roue 20 *Tanzer 31 References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:2010s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Hunter Marine ","title":"Marlow-Hunter 31"},{"id":"59603573","text":"Rigoletto or The King Amuses Himself (German: Der K√∂nig am√ºsiert sich) is a 1918 Austrian silent historical film directed by Jacob Fleck, Luise Fleck and starring Wilhelm Klitsch, Hermann Benke and Liane Haid.

He has founded several companies including pHish Doctor (pH sensors for home aquariums), Ocean Optics Inc. (OOI) (miniature spectrometers), and SpectrEcology (engineering and support services for optical sensing applications). Morris is credited with developing the first miniature spectrometer. The miniature spectrometers introduced by Morris' Ocean Optics have wide applications in the food industry, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, aquaculture, the environment, medicine, dentistry, and forensics. They have been used on the Mir Space Station, the Space Shuttle, and the Mars Rover Curiosity. They have been used to discover new information about the structure and properties of the Hope Diamond and other blue diamonds. Education Morris has a B.Sc. in Chemical and Cell Biology from Rutgers University and an M.Sc. in Marine Science from the University of South Florida. Career Morris gained experience as a sales representative for Fisher Scientific. He also served as the associate director of technology transfer for the Southern Technology Applications Center for technology entrepreneurs, sponsored by NASA. His first entrepreneurial venture, in 1986, was pHish Doctor. He borrowed $10,000 to create the company, which sold pH sensors for home aquariums. That project was successful enough to help him start his next company. Morris worked with Robert Byrne, Luis Garcia-Rubio, and Roy Walters from the University of Central Florida, on the development of a fiber-optic pH sensor for use in seawater. In 1989, they co-founded Ocean Optics, Inc. with the help of a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. A miniature spectrometer that they had developed as part of the fiber-optic project became the company's core product. They introduced the first miniature fiber-optic spectrometer, the S1000, in 1992. It was capable of measuring wavelengths in the visible range. The company focused its mission around being agile, understanding customers' desires and creating applications to meet customer demand, \\"enabling any measurement involving absorbance, transmission, reflection, or emission of light.\\" The company was bought by Halma in 2004. After the sale of Ocean Optics Morris went on to found SpectrEcology, which specializes in engineering and support services for applications that use optical sensing. Applications =NASA projects= Ocean Optics' miniature spectrometers have been used on the Mir Space Station, the Space Shuttle, and the Mars Rover Curiosity. In 2009, an Ocean Optics QE65000 Spectrometer named \\"ALICE\\" was modified by Aurora Design & Technology for use in NASA's Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission. ALICE measured ultraviolet light resulting from the impact of the Centaur upper rocket stage on the floor of the crater Cabeus. This confirmed that water ice is present on the moon. The Rocky 7 Rover prototype used an Ocean Optics point spectrometer which was sensitive in the range of 350-800 nm. Three Ocean Optics HR2000 spectrometers were customized as part of the ChemCam unit of the NASA Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, which was launched November 26, 2011. The spectrometers were configured to measure different wavelengths of light, in the ranges of 240-336 nm, 380-470 nm, and 470-850 nm. The Laser Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) used a laser to fire a series of very short pulses at a nearby target. The initial shots cleared away any dust, while the later ones heated the rock to create a flash of ionized gas or plasm. The resulting light was measured by the spectrometers and the spectra were analyzed to determine the composition of Martian rock and soil. Since landing, the ChemCam has identified hundreds of thousands of samples, including calcium, gypsum and bassanite. The incorporation of an instrument for Raman spectroscopy is being planned by NASA's Mars 2020 Rover Science Definition Team. =Blue diamonds= Ocean Optics' portable spectrometers have been also been used to examine the phosphorescence spectrum of the Hope Diamond, the Blue Heart Diamond and other natural type IIb blue diamonds. The Smithsonian, the United States Naval Research Laboratory, Ocean Optics Co. and Pennsylvania State University collaborated on a study to examine hundreds of blue diamonds. Researchers examined the spectral and temporal properties of the diamonds using a USB2000-FL spectrometer for UV/Vis light studies and an IR512 spectrometer for Raman spectroscopy. The Hope Diamond, in the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, shows a distinctive red phosphorescent glow when exposed to ultraviolet light. Visible to the human eye, it had never been explained. The researchers discovered that all blue diamonds show red and green peaks in their phosphorescence spectrum, due to the presence of nitrogen and boron in the stones. The intensity and rate of decay of the spectrum varies from diamond to diamond. This technique may enable individual blue diamonds to be \\"fingerprinted\\" for identification purposes. =Other applications= Ocean Optics' miniature spectrometers are used in hospitals, in airport security and in university and high school chemistry labs. They have applications in the food industry, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, aquaculture, the environment, medicine, dentistry, and forensics. Their small size means that they can be incorporated into scientific instruments that are used outside laboratories, in industrial production settings, on agricultural fields, for environmental monitoring, and for point of care medical use.

The design and layout of interconnects on an IC is vital to its proper function, performance, power efficiency, reliability, and fabrication yield. The material interconnects are made from depends on many factors. Chemical and mechanical compatibility with the semiconductor substrate, and the dielectric in between the levels of interconnect is necessary, otherwise barrier layers are needed. Suitability for fabrication is also required; some chemistries and processes prevent integration of materials and unit processes into a larger technology (recipe) for IC fabrication. In fabrication, interconnects are formed during the back-end-of-line after the fabrication of the transistors on the substrate. Interconnects are classified as local or global interconnects depending on the signal propagation distance it is able to support. The width and thickness of the interconnect, as well as the material from which it is made, are some of the significant factors that determine the distance a signal may propagate. Local interconnects connect circuit elements that are very close together, such as transistors separated by ten or so other contiguously laid out transistors. Global interconnects can transmit further, such as over large-area sub-circuits. Consequently, local interconnects may be formed from materials with relatively high electrical resistivity such as polycrystalline silicon (sometimes silicided to extend its range) or tungsten. To extend the distance an interconnect may reach, various circuits such as buffers or restorers may be inserted at various points along a long interconnect. Interconnect properties The geometric properties of an interconnect are width, thickness, spacing (the distance between an interconnect and another on the same level), pitch (the sum of the width and spacing), and aspect ratio, or AR, (the thickness divided by width). The width, spacing, AR, and ultimately, pitch, are constrained in their minimum and maximum values by design rules that ensure the interconnect (and thus the IC) can be fabricated by the selected technology with a reasonable yield. Width is constrained to ensure minimum width interconnects do not suffer breaks, and maximum width interconnects can be planarized by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Spacing is constrained to ensure adjacent interconnects can be fabricated without any conductive material bridging. Thickness is determined solely by the technology, and the aspect ratio, by the chosen width and set thickness. In technologies that support multiple levels of interconnects, each group of contiguous levels, or each level, has its own set of design rules. Before the introduction of CMP for planarizing IC layers, interconnects had design rules that specified larger minimum widths and spaces than the lower level to ensure that the underlying layer's rough topology did not cause breaks in the interconnect formed on top. The introduction of CMP has made finer geometries possible. The AR is an important factor. In technologies that form interconnect structures with conventional processes, the AR is limited to ensure that the etch creating the interconnect, and the dielectric deposition that fills the voids in between interconnects with dielectric, can be done successful. In those that form interconnect structures with damascene processes, the AR must permit successful etch of the trenches, deposition of the barrier metal (if needed) and interconnect material. Interconnect layout are further restrained by design rules that apply to collections of interconnects. For a given area, technologies that rely on CMP have density rules to ensure the whole IC has an acceptable variation in interconnect density. This is because the rate at which CMP removes material depends on the material's properties, and great variations in interconnect density can result in large areas of dielectric which can dish, resulting in poor planarity. To maintain acceptable density, dummy interconnects (or dummy wires) are inserted into regions with spare interconnect density. Historically, interconnects were routed in straight lines, and could change direction by using sections aligned 45¬∞ away from the direction of travel. As IC structure geometries became smaller, to obtain acceptable yields, restrictions were imposed on interconnect direction. Initially, only global interconnects were subject to restrictions; were made to run in straight lines aligned eastwest or northsouth. To allow easy routing, alternate levels of interconnect ran in the same alignment, so that changes in direction were achieved by connecting to a lower or upper level of interconnect though a via. Local interconnects, especially the lowest level (usually polysilicon) could assume a more arbitrary combination of routing options to attain the a higher packing density. Materials In silicon ICs, the most commonly used semiconductor in ICs, the first interconnects were made of aluminum. By the 1970s, substrate compatibility and reliability concerns (mostly concerning electromigration forced the use of aluminum-based alloys containing silicon, copper, or both. By the late 1990s, the high resistivity of aluminum, coupled with the narrow widths of the interconnect structures forced by continuous feature size downscaling, resulted in prohibitively high resistance in interconnect structures. This forced aluminum's replacement by copper interconnects. In gallium arsenide (GaAs) ICs, which have been mainly used in application domains (e.g. monolithic microwave ICs) different to those of silicon, the predominant material used for interconnects is gold. Performance enhancements To reduce the delay penalty caused by parasitic capacitance, the dielectric material used to insulate adjacent interconnects, and interconnects on different levels (the inter-level dielectric [ILD]), should have a dielectric constant that is as close to 1 as possible. A class of such materials, Low-Œ∫ dielectrics, were introduced during the late 1990s and early 2000s for this purpose. As of January 2019, the most advanced materials reduce the dielectric constant to very low levels through highly porous structures, or through the creation of substantial air or vacuum pockets (air gap dielectric). These materials often have low mechanical strength, and are restricted to the lowest level or levels of interconnect as a result. The high density of interconnects at the lower levels, along with the minimal spacing, helps support the upper layers. Intel introduced air gap dielectric in its 14nm technology in 2014. Multi-level interconnects IC with complex circuits require multiple levels of interconnect to form circuits that have minimal area. As of 2018, the most complex ICs may have over 15 layers of interconnect. Each level of interconnect is separated from each other by a layer of dielectric. To make vertical connects between interconnects on different levels, vias are used. The top-most layers of a chip have the thickest and widest and most widely separated metal layers, which make the wires on those layers have the least resistance and smallest RC time constant, so they are used for power and clock distribution networks. The bottom-most metal layers of the chip, closest to the transistors, have thin, narrow, tightly-packed wires, used only for local interconnect. Adding layers can potentially improve performance, but adding layers also reduces yield and increases manufacturing cost. ICs with a single metal layer typically use the polysilicon layer to \\"jump across\\" when one signal needs to cross another signal. The process used to form DRAM capacitors creates a rough and hilly surface, which makes it difficult to add metal interconnect layers and still maintain good yield. In 1998, state-of-the-art DRAM processes had four metal layers, while state-of-the-art logic processes had seven metal layers. 1998\\\\. In 2002, five or six layers of metal interconnect was common. In 2009, 1Gbit DRAM typically had three layers of metal interconnect; tungsten for the first layer and aluminum for the upper layers.

He backed the latter against his own tribesmen during a coup attempt in 689. He was a key figure in securing the Umayyad hold over Iraq during the governorship of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, helping the latter defeat the Kharijites in 696/97 and the rebellion of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath in 700/01. Life Sufyan ibn al-Abrad belonged to the Banu Kalb tribe,Al- Tabari, ed. Hawting 1989, p. 52. which played a key role in the preservation of the Umayyad Caliphate during the leadership crisis in the wake of Caliph Muawiya II‚Äôs death and the Second Muslim Civil War. Sufyan was nicknamed al- Asamm (\\"the deaf\\" or \\"the undeterrable\\"). During the leadership crisis in Damascus, the governor of the province, al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, refused to read a letter during the Friday prayer from the Kalbi chieftain and staunch Umayyad loyalist, Ibn Bahdal, that proclaimed the legitimacy of the Umayyads and the disparagement of their Mecca-based rival for the caliphate, Abdallah ibn al-Zubayr. In reaction to his refusal, Sufyan was one of a number of Umayyad loyalists in attendance who repeated after the other the contents of the letter. They were subsequently jailed by al-Dahhak. However, a group of Kalbi tribesmen soon after went to the prison and secured Sufyan‚Äôs release. Marwan I acceded with the critical help of the Banu Kalb, and was succeeded by his son Abd al-Malik in 685. In 689, Sufyan and his Kalbi kinsman Hassan ibn Malik ibn Bahdal backed Abd al-Malik against the Umayyad prince Amr ibn Said al-Ashdaq when the latter rebelled and seized the capital Damascus during Abd al-Malik‚Äôs absence.Al-Tabari, ed. Fishbein 1990, pp. 155‚Äì157. Sufyan fought against Humayd ibn Hurayth ibn Bahdal, another senior Kalbi, and his brother Zuhayr ibn al-Abrad. The leading Kalbi warriors on either side duelled with each other during the standoff outside the caliph‚Äôs palace, where al-Ashdaq had barricaded himself. They were ultimately compelled by their womenfolk and children not to shed each other‚Äôs blood for the sake of the Umayyads. Al- Ashdaq ultimately surrendered and was executed by Abd al-Malik. During the reign of Abd al-Malik, the caliph dispatched Sufyan at the head of a regiment of Syrian troops to reinforce the governor of Iraq, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf.Kennedy 2001, p. 33.Rihan 2014, p. 109. The latter, with his Iraqi troops, had been unable to repel a Kharijite assault on Kufa led by Shabib ibn Yazid al-Shaybani and requested Syrian troops. Sufyan‚Äôs men defeated the rebels, pursued Shabib and ultimately killed the Kharijite leader in a battle at Ahwaz in 696/97.Bosworth 1968, p. 47.Rihan 2014, p. 110. Sufyan was later sent to pursue the Kharijites deep into Tabaristan, where his forces,Kennedy 2001, p. 34. together with a Kufan army led by Ishaq ibn Muhammad ibn al- Ash'ath, killed their leader Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a.Bosworth 1968, p. 52. In 700/01, Sufyan led the small Syrian contingent that held out with al-Hajjaj in Basra during the mass revolt of the Iraqi tribal nobility led by Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath. After a month of repulsing Iraqi attacks, Sufyan led his men in a charge against the rebels and forced them to withdraw to Kufa. Later, when al-Hajjaj received significant reinforcements from Abd al- Malik, Sufyan commanded the Syrian cavalry that stamped out the revolt. Assessment Historian Antoine Borrut describes Sufyan as \\"an astute general with outstanding military skills, who was celebrated for his bravery\\"Kennedy 2014, p. 7 and historian Hugh N. Kennedy calls him a veteran commander \\"who did so much to secure Iraq for the Umayyads\\".Kennedy 2001, p. 99. He was among the forerunners of the professional commanders who emerged under the Abbasid Caliphate.

The band comprises vocalist and guitarist Grant Mullen, bassist and vocalist Gianni Aiello, and drummer Henry LaVallee. After releasing their lo-fi EP R.I.P. in 2016, they were signed by New West Records. The band released their debut studio album SLUFF on March 30, 2018, to positive critical reviews. Naked Giants toured through 2018 and 2019 with indie rock band Car Seat Headrest. They released their second studio album The Shadow on 21 August 2020. History =2014‚Äì2017: Formation and R.I.P.= Grant Mullen and Henry LaVallee met in pre-school. In their teenage years they took up practicing music together and discovered they had musical chemistry. At 17 or 18, the duo decided to pursue music together and create the band. Naked Giants had their first practice in August, 2014. Gianni was part of a synthpop band called Laser Fox at the time, playing bass for the group. LaVallee and Mullen discovered Aiello at a live performance at the Crocodile cafe in Seattle. According to Aiello, \\"they thought I looked really cool, and they liked my moves, and they said I could play the bass really well.\\" He was then invited to perform with them in Mercer Island, and joined the group. They released their first single Easy Eating in 2016, followed by three more prior to the release of the R.I.P. EP, distributed via Miscreant Records. The EP was well- received by Andi Villegas of North West Music Scene. After winning a battle of the bands contest, Naked Giants became a member of New West Records and started work on their debut studio album. =2017‚Äì2020: SLUFF, touring, and Green Fuzz= In 2017, Naked Giants collaborated with fellow New Records signee Ron Gallo on his 7\\" single Sorry Not Everybody Is You/The Age of Information. Their debut album, SLUFF was produced by Steve Fisk, who had previously worked with Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Car Seat Headrest. On the direction for SLUFF, Mullen said \\"it's a smorgasbord of shit. Loud rock music, that's what it is.\\" Aiello spoke of the project, \\"it's that kind of thing where you make something and you don't really know what it is, but you understand it later.\\" Despite interpretations that SLUFF stands for South Lake Union Fuck Faces, Naked Giants state that is only one view. \\"Sluff\\" can also be \\"either slang for the black gunk that comes off your shoes when it snows in the winter, ... or what a snake does when it sheds its skin\\" according to different members. The album was released on March 30, 2018, and included twelve tracks. The first single released off of the album was \\"TV\\", which was accompanied by a music video directed by Sean Downey and released on the New West Records YouTube channel. Their second single was \\"Everybody Thinks They Know (But No One Really Knows)\\", and the third single was the titular track \\"SLUFF\\". The album dabbles with blues on the song \\"Slow Dance II\\", and in themes of duality and gender identity on the closer track \\"Shredded Again.\\" Naked Giants went on tour with Car Seat Headrest performing both their own songs and Car Seat Headrest's in a seven-man set. Their performance in Olympia, Washington was well-received and Billboard named their performance with Car Seat Headrest in Brooklyn one of their favorite live performances of the year. Grant Mullen said in July, 2018, that they may have 16 months of touring and promotion left still to do before a new album is released. On 25 January 2019, the group released the Green Fuzz E.P., including the songs Green Fuzz, That's Who's Really Pointing At Me, and an acoustic version of Everybody Thinks They Know (But No One Really Knows). According to Henry LaVallee, \\"The Green Fuzz EP concept was to give a few of our longer songs a platform to exist that would be something excellent to own as a 10\\". On 17 July, 2019, Naked Giants released a music video for the song Green Fuzz with a plot revolving around three students attempting to solve the mystery of several missing students and a Green Fuzz monster. In 2018, Naked Giants stated that they are already working on demos and takes for a new album. In the interview for ANCHR Magazine, Aiello stated that they had already completed 9 demos for a sophomore album. Aiello said that the second studio album would try to refine what was done well on SLUFF and that the album was about \\"realizing ... where you are in the world and how you fit into [the] balance of oppression and privilege and how to navigate that and navigate your own anxiety of these things you internalize.\\" =2020-Present: The Shadow, second album= On 11 June 2020, Naked Giants released their lead single from their second studio album The Shadow produced by Chris Funk, with a socially distanced music video due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The song was described by the band as representing the \\"dance-the-stress-away attitude we‚Äôve had since the band was formed\\" and that the song's lyrics are meant to represent the \\"big unanswered questions in our lives, like the mechanisms of privilege and oppression or the capitalist oxymoron of individualism and assimilation, and we‚Äôre pairing it all with a danceable backbeat to tell people it‚Äôs ok to get up off the couch and do something about it.\\" They also describe The Shadow as \\"a much more honest album than SLUFF\\" about the \\"part of yourself that‚Äôs hard to confront and understand\\" and \\"facing that darkness and having the strength to bring it into the light.\\" Aiello said that many of the songs on The Shadow had been brewing for a long time, and that they \\"leaned into our ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s influences for this record. We took a lot of inspiration from bands like Devo, The Cure, U2, Talking Heads, My Bloody Valentine, and The Fall, as well as our usual sources like Neil Young, Black Sabbath, and all that classic stuff.\\" Aiello also said that Chris Funk was an important part of the creative process, suggesting taking away Henry's cymbals on some songs. Their second album, The Shadow released on August 21st, 2020. Critics noted the album's more diverse sound including more stylistic influences from Mudhoney, and post-punk influences a la Joy Division on songs like Turns Blue, The Ripper, and Unpeeled. Other influences noted by critics were The Ramones and The Talking Heads. The album has been received positively. Maeri Ferguson of No Depression notes that Turns Blue \\"is a standout, unexpectedly knocking the wind out of you with its silken vocals and air of solitude that feels fitting for a time of unprecedented loneliness and isolation,\\" and that the trio \\"use their harmonies strategically, sometimes mono and hypnotic to work you into a trance, other times primal and deeply felt, like a long-awaited release of tension.\\" Jeremy Lukens of Glide Magazine wrote that The Shadow was more melodic than SLUFF and, whilst having a \\"slightly overproduced pop sheen detracting from the band‚Äôs primal nature,\\" that The Shadow \\"deftly blends Naked Giants‚Äô influences of early-2000s garage rock with 1990s alternative. Lukens also found the eponymous song The Shadow to be the highlight of the album.

It is viewed by historians as an ideological successor to the earlier Alfredism and veneration for Anglo-Saxon institutions in the 17th and 18th centuries. Racialized Anglo-Saxonism contained both competing and intersecting doctrines, such as Victorian-era Old Northernism and the Teutonic germ theory which it relied upon in appropriating Germanic (particularly Norse) cultural and racial origins for the Anglo-Saxon \\"race\\". Predominantly a product of certain Anglo-American societies, and organisations of the era: In 2017, Mary Dockray-Miller, an American scholar of Anglo-Saxon England, stated that there was an increasing interest in the study of 19th- century Anglo-Saxonism. Anglo-Saxonism is regarded as a predecessor ideology to the later Nordicism of the 20th century, which was generally less anti- Celtic and broadly sought to racially reconcile Celtic identity with Germanic under the label of Nordic. Background In terminology, Anglo-Saxonism is by far the most commonly used phrase to describe the historical ideology of rooting a Germanic racial identity, whether Anglo-Saxon, Norse or Teutonic, into the concept of the English, Scottish or British nation, and subsequently founded-nations such as the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In both historical and contemporary literature however, Anglo-Saxonism has many derivations, such as the commonly used phrase Teutonism or Anglo- Teutonism, which can be used as form of catch-all to describe American or British Teutonism and further extractions such as English or Scottish Teutonism. It is also occasionally encompassed by the longer phrase Anglo- Saxon Teutonism, or shorter labels Anglism or Saxonism, along with the most frequently used term of Anglo-Saxonism itself. American medievalist Allen Frantzen credits historian L. Perry Curtis's use of Anglo-Saxonism as a term for \\"an unquestioned belief in Anglo-Saxon 'genius'\\" during this period of history. Curtis has pointed toward a radical change from 16th- and 17th- century adulation of Anglo-Saxon institutions towards something more racial and imperialist. Historian Barbara Yorke, who specializes in the subject, has similarly argued that the earlier self-governance oriented Anglo-Saxonism of Thomas Jefferson's era had by the mid-19th century developed into \\"a belief in racial superiority\\". According to Australian scholar Helen Young, the ideology of 19th-century Anglo-Saxonism was \\"profoundly racist\\" and influenced authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and his fictional works into the 20th century. Similarly, Marxist writer Peter Fryer has claimed that \\"Anglo-Saxonism was a form of racism that originally arose to justify the British conquest and occupation of Ireland\\". Some scholars believe the Anglo-Saxonism championed by historians and politicians of the Victorian era influenced and helped to spawn the Greater Britain Movement of the mid-20th-century. In 2019, the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists decided to change its name due to the potential confusion of their organization's name with racist Anglo-Saxonism. At the passing of the 19th-century Anglo-Saxonism era, progressive intellectual Randolph Bourne's essay Trans-National America reacted positively to integration (\\"We have needed the new peoples\\"), and while mocking the \\"indistinguishable dough of Anglo-Saxonism\\" in the context of very early 20th- century migration to the United States, Bourne manages to express an anxiety at the American melting pot theory. Origins =Early references= In 1647, English MP John Hare, who served during the Long Parliament, issued a pamphlet declaring England as a \\"member of the Teutonick nation, and descended out of Germany\\". In the context of the English Civil War, this anti-Norman and pro-Germanic paradigm has been identified as perhaps the earliest iteration of \\"English Teutonism\\" by Professor Nick Groom, who has suggested the 1714 Hanoverian succession, where the German House of Hanover ascended the throne of Great Britain, is the culmination of this Anglo-Saxonist ideology. =Teutonic germ theory= Racialized Anglo-Saxonism was largely founded on \\"Teutonic germ theory\\". Many historians and political scientists in Britain and the United States supported it in the 19th-century. The theory supposed that American and British democracy and institutions had their roots in Teutonic peoples, and that Germanic tribes had spread this \\"germ\\" within their race from ancient Germany to England and on to North America. Advocacy in Britain included the likes of John Mitchell Kemble, William Stubbs, and Edward Augustus Freeman. Within the U.S., future president Woodrow Wilson, along with Albert Bushnell Hart and Herbert Baxter Adams were applying historical and social science in advocacy for Anglo-Saxonism through the theory. In the 1890s, under the influence of Frederick Jackson Turner, Wilson abandoned the Teutonic germ theory in favor of a frontier model for the sources of American democracy.Lloyd Ambrosius, \\"Democracy, Peace, and World Order\\" in Ancestry and racial identity =Germanic and Teutonic= Anglo-Saxonism of the era sought to emphasize Britain's cultural and racial ties with Germany, frequently referring to Teutonic peoples as a source of strength and similarity. Contemporary historian Robert Boyce notes that many 19th-century British politicians promoted these Germanic links, such as Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer who said that it was \\"in the free forests of Germany that the infant genius of our liberty was nursed\\", and Thomas Arnold who claimed that \\"Our English race is the German race; for though our Norman fathers had learned to speak a stranger‚Äôs language, yet in blood, as we know, they were the Saxon‚Äôs brethren both alike belonging to the Teutonic or German stock\\". =Norman and Celtic= Anglo-Saxonists in the 19th-century often sought to downplay, or outright denigrate, the significance of both Norman and Celtic racial and cultural influence in Britain. Less frequently however, some form of solidarity was expressed by some Anglo-Saxonists, who conveyed that Anglo-Saxonism was simply \\"the best-known term to denote that mix of Celtic, Saxon, Norse and Norman blood which now flows in the united stream in the veins of the Anglo-Saxon peoples\\". Although a staunch Anglo-Saxonist, Thomas Carlyle had even disparagingly described the United States as a kind of \\"formless\\" Saxon tribal order, and claimed that Normans had given Anglo-Saxons and their descendants a greater sense of order for national structure, and that this was particularly evident in England. =Northern European= Edward Augustus Freeman, a leading Anglo-Saxonist of the era, promoted a larger northern European identity, favorably comparing civilizational roots from \\"German forest\\" or \\"Scandinavian rock\\" with the cultural legacy of ancient Greece and Rome. American scholar Mary Dockray-Miller expands on this concept to suggest that pre-World War I Anglo-Saxonism ideology helped establish the \\"primacy of northern European ancestry in United States culture at large\\". =Lowland Scottish= During the 19th-century century in particular, Scottish people living in Lowland Scotland, near the Anglo-Scottish border, \\"increasingly identified themselves with the Teutonic world destiny of Anglo- Saxonism\\", and sought to separate their identity from that of Highland Scots, or the \\"inhabitants of Romantic Scotland\\". With some considering themselves \\"Anglo-Saxon Lowlanders\\", public opinion of Lowland Scots turned on Gaels within the context of the Highland Famine, with suggestions of deportations to British colonies for Highlanders of the \\"'inferior Celtic race\\". Amongst others, Goldwin Smith, a devout Anglo-Saxonist, believed the Anglo-Saxon \\"race\\" included Lowland Scots and should not be exclusively defined by English ancestry within the context of the United Kingdom's greater empire. Thomas Carlyle, himself a Scot, was one of the earliest notable people to express a \\"belief in Anglo-Saxon racial superiority\\". Historian Richard J. Finlay has suggested that the Scots National League, which campaigned for Scotland to separate from the United Kingdom, was a response or opposition to the history of \\"Anglo-Saxon teutonism\\" embedded in some Scottish culture. Mythology and religions Nineteenth-century Anglo-Saxonism was largely aligned with Protestantism, generally perceiving Catholics as outsiders, and was orientated as an ideology in opposition to other \\"races\\", such as the \\"Celts\\" of Ireland and \\"Latins\\" of Spain. Charles Kingsley was particularly focused on there being a \\"strong Norse element in Teutonism and Anglo-Saxonism\\". He blended Protestantism of the day with the Old Norse religion, saying that the Church of England was \\"wonderfully and mysteriously fitted for the souls of a free Norse-Saxon race\\". He believed the ancestors of Anglo-Saxons, Norse people and Germanic peoples had physically fought beside the god Odin, and that the British monarchy of his time was genetically descended from him. Political aims =Expansion= Embedded in 19th-century Anglo-Saxonism was a growing sense that the \\"Anglo Saxon\\" race must expand into surrounding territories. This particularly expressed itself in American politics and culture in the form of Manifest Destiny. =Shared citizenship= A persistent \\"Anglo- Saxonist\\" idea, Albert Venn Dicey believed in the creation of a shared citizenship between Britons and Americans, and the concept of cooperation, even federation, of those from the \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" race.

Her work centered on themes of the body, love, sex, death, movement, and the female gaze. Despite this focus on women, she has resisted being labeled as a feminist. She began as a painter, and but her later and better known work centers on performance and film, though she has also written several books. She cites Salvador Dal√≠ and Luis Bu√±uel as influences to her experimental film work, as well as the Bauhaus artists of Germany. During her time as an experimental filmmaker in Argentina, she frequented the Di Tella Institute and the Goethe Institute, a place where many of her works premiered. Recently, her work has been honored through several retrospectives at international film festivals, though it was relatively unknown outside of exclusive circles when it first premiered.  Biography  = Childhood = Hirsch was born Narcisa Heuser in Berlin, Germany, in 1928, to Heinrich Heuser and a German-Argentinean mother. Her father was an Expressionist painter, who left her mother and her when Hirsch was five. Heuser was an Expressionist painter, and Hirsch would explore this medium first when she began making art. She grew up in Tyrol, but was sent to a school in Vienna at the age of 8 with no prior education. At 9 she and her mother visited Argentina, which turned into a much longer stay than intended when World War II broke out. They officially emigrated in 1937. = Adulthood = In 1950, Hirsch married Paul Hirsch, a German Jew from Frankfurt, adopted his surname, and raised three children with him. She joined an avante garde group consisting of Claudio Caldini, Juan Jos√© Mugni, Juan Villola, Horacio Valleregio and Marie Louise Alemann, where Hirsch's focus was on bringing art to the people through performance. She and Alemann were co-leaders of the group. Her group often was at arms with similar groups in Buenos Aires, often inciting arguments with other groups that morphed into Happenings. Her work as an artist began in the organization of these happenings, the most notable being Manzanas and La Marabunta. Because her group of experimental filmmakers was accepted by neither the politically active filmmaking groups or the commercial groups, it mostly escaped notice during the bloody uprisings in the late seventies in Argentina. The group was highly resourceful and experimental, shooting and projecting wherever and whenever they could, once projecting their films on the back of a white rabbit. Because of the highly experimental nature of their work, traditional gallery spaces shied away from the group, all except the Goethe Institute, who gave them a formal place to screen their work. Though she was well educated, she did not receive any formal training in film.  Work  Hirsch began her work as an artist in painting and drawing, though she did do some work in wood carving and prints. She later shifted to performance art, and transitioned to experimental film after working on editing footage from one of her performance pieces. During the 70's, during Argentina's brutal dictatorship, she also took to the streets, posting political graffiti. = Performance = La Marabunta was performed in 1967 by both her and the other members of the group she was a part of. Consisting of a giant female skeleton covered in fruit and stuffed with live pigeons, Hirsch became interested in the idea of filmmaking when she sought out filmmaker Raymundo Gleyzer to record the act of passerby's removing the fruit, metaphorically and physically devouring the female body, specifically a pineapple which she placed at the sex of the skeleton. It was performed at the El Coliseo Theater. = Film = Hirsch became interested in film after filming the creative process of La Marabunta, and its respective performances. After becoming interested in film, Hirsch traveled to New York and began to explore New American Cinema, and attending classes at the MOMA. In her time in New York, she also explored the Anthology Film Archives. She worked in 16mm and on Super 8 film because their inexpensive prices allowed her to make non-commercial film. She fell into a group of filmmakers that included Marie Louise Alemann, Claudio Caldini, Horacio Vallereggio, Juan Villola, and Juan Jos√© Mugni. They rarely screened their works in traditional venues, with the exception of the Goethe Institute, which allowed them the creative freedom they desired. This group often earned the name \\"Groupo Goethe\\" because of the patronage of the Goethe Institute. In 1976, Hirsch won a contest from UNCIPAR with her film Comeout, which consists of two shots of a record player. In the first, through manipulation of the lens and the lighting, the record player is slowly revealed, and the second features an over head stagnant shot of the record. It was scored to the Steve Reich song of the same name, and included a voice saying \\"come out and show them\\" over and over with increasing confusion. Meant to produce a sense of disorientation in the viewers, it was negatively perceived by critics, who had yet to appreciate experimental film. Regardless, she took first prize at the contest. In that same year, she met her mentor Werner Nekes while studying at the Goethe Institutes of Buenos Aires. At this time, she also began using mostly Super 8 camera. Another of her works, Taller was similarly minimalist. It featured a single shot of a wall of her studio, while she verbally describes what the viewer sees. Then, she goes on to describe the other unseen parts of her studio, creating a personal work similar to many of her earlier works. Though there is only one shot, the viewer can tell the camera is moving because of fluctuations in light and shadow. Throughout the film's 11-minute run time, Hirsch continuously narrates, revealing deeper truths and personal stories behind the objects depicted on the screen. Hirsch has an extended body of work beyond these pieces, including Diarios Patag√≥nicos (1972‚Äì73), Taller (1975), Testamento y Vida Interior (1977), Homecoming (1978), Ama-zona (1983), A-Dios (1989), Rumi (1999), Aleph (2005), and El Mito de Narciso (2011). She has directed several dozen more films, and began to receive critical recognition for her work from several international film festivals in the 2010s. She has been screened all over the world, including in Los Angeles at The Hammer Museum. Her work is also part of the traveling exhibit started at The Hammer called \\"Radical Women: Latin American Art 1960 - 1985\\". = Publications = When Super 8 film became obsolete, Hirsch turned to writing, publishing several books in Argentina. These books are La Pasi√≥n Segun San Juan, El Silencio, El Olvido del Ser, LA Filosof√≠a es una Pasion In√∫til, and Aigokeros.

It is located at a distance of circa 60 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 4665 is about 75,000 light years across. NGC 4665 lies 2 and 3/4 degrees east-south east of Delta Virginis and 50 arcminutes southwest of 35 Virginis. It can be viewed through a telescope at a 23 magnification, forming a pair with an 11th magnitude star 1.5 arcminutes southwest. It is part of the Herschel 400 Catalogue. It was discovered by William Herschel on February 23, 1784, however, he noted a location 10 arcminutes off the galaxy, where there is no object. It was observed by William Herschel again on April 30, 1786, noting the correct coordinates, and he misidentified it as another nebula. The fact that they are the same object was noted by John Louis Emil Dreyer in 1912 in the corrections of the New General Catalogue. It was also recorded independently on April 9, 1828 by John Herschel. NGC 4665 has a luminous, slightly elliptical bulge and a prominent bar with high surface brightness. The isophotes appear boxy at the end of the bar. The total bar length is estimated to be near 3 kpc. The bar is slightly twisted, turning near 12 degrees along its axis. Two diffuse, faint arms emerge from each side of the bar and form a pseudoring. The surface brightness of the arms is higher near the bar. The southern arm appears a bit stronger.

He was then sent to the seminary in Wernersville, Pennsylvania and then Spring Hill College in Alabama in 1942. He began teaching chemistry, philosophy, logic, and German at Loyola College in Maryland at the age of 24. In 1951, he was ordained a priest at the Facultes St. Albert de Louvain in Belgium. Following his ordination, he was made a professor of theology at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He became the Dean of Georgetown College at Georgetown University in 1957, and remained in the position until 1964. Sellinger was expected to become the next President of Georgetown University, but had a falling-out with the Jesuit hierarchy, and was sent to Loyola.  Loyola College  Sellinger was appointed president of Loyola College in Maryland in 1964. He oversaw significant changes in the school as a result of the turmoil of the 1960s as well as the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. Among these was the conversion of the college from all-male to co-educational (despite his initial opposition), which occurred after the absorption of Mount Saint Agnes College in 1971. Over the course of his almost 30-year presidency, the school transitioned from a small commuter school to a regional college. He acquired the school's first dormitory in 1967, Hammerman House, and established the School of Business and Management as its own institution in 1983. A successful fundraiser, he created the school's endowment, which totaled $42 million at the time of his death. Likewise, the school's operating budget increased from $1.4 million in 1964 to $65 million in 1993; the number of professors increased from 100 to 400 in the same time. The campus also grew from to . He died on April 19, 1993, of pancreatic cancer in the President's House on Loyola College's campus, and his funeral was held in the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen. He is interred at the Jesuit Novitiate of St. Isaac Jogues in Wernersville. His presidency was the longest of any among the Jesuit universities in the United States.  Legacy  Sellinger Lounge in the Leavey Center at Georgetown is named in his honor. Governor William Donald Schaefer announced in 1993 that the state of Maryland's program for distributing money to private colleges would be named after him. This fund was challenged before the United States Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds, and Sellinger partook in the program's defense along with other private colleges; the constitutionality of the fund was upheld in 1976, in the case of Romer v. Board of Public Works. In 1984, Loyola College's business school was renamed the Rev. Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management in honor of him, after an anonymous donor pledged $1 million to the school contingent upon its renaming.

Invented by and named for Alexander Dounce , a Dounce homogenizer or \\"Douncer\\", is a cylindrical glass tube, closed at one end, with two glass pestles of carefully specified outer diameters, intended for the gentle homogenization of eukaryotic cells (e.g. mammalian cells). Dounce homogenizers are still commonly used today to isolate cellular organelles. The two Dounce homogenizer pestles (known as the \\"loose\\" or \\"A\\" and \\"tight\\" or \\"B\\" pestles), have a carefully specified outer diameter, relative to the inner diameter of the cylinder. The \\"A\\" (loose) pestle has a clearance from the cylinder wall of (~0.0025 - 0.0055 in.) while the \\"B\\" (tight) pestle has a clearance of (~0.0005 - 0.0025 in.).http://www.kimble- chase.com/literature/TissueGrinders.pdf This allows for tissue and cells to be lysed by shear stress with minimal (if any) degree of heating, thereby leaving extracted organelles or heat-sensitive enzyme complexes largely intact. Typically, a soft tissue (e.g. mammalian liver) is cut or broken into smaller pieces and placed into the glass cylinder, alongside a suitable volume of an appropriate lysis buffer. Homogenization is performed by a defined number of \\"passes\\" of the pestles, first with the loose pestle, then with the tight pestle, up and down the cylinder. Five to ten passes are typical. Dounce homogenizers are typically produced from borosilicate glass, but are still fragile, and should be used with care. Especially hard or tough tissues should be pre-homogenized before use in a dounce homogenizer. Eukaryotic cells with tough cell walls, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cannot be directly lysed with a dounce homogenizer, unless the cell wall is first broken down (e.g. with lyticase, or zymolyase in the case of S. cerevisiae).

The university is home to the University of Georgia Campus Arboretum.  Main campus  University of Georgia Chapel Historic North Campus Situated on a main campus, in 2012 the university had a workforce of more than 9,800, an annual budget of about $1.49 billion (only 29% provided by the state of Georgia), and a physical plant valued at some $600 million, making it one of the largest employers in Georgia and a major contributor to the state's economic and cultural vitality. Transit at the University of Georgia is maintained by UGA Campus Transit. Athens has been named one of the top ten places in America to live and is home to many popular music artists including the American rock bands R.E.M. and Widespread Panic. UGA has been ranked number one among \\"campus scenes that rock!\\" by Rolling Stone magazine. Every summer since 1996 the city has hosted AthFest, a non-profit music and arts festival in the downtown area. While university students can enjoy the college town of Athens, they are less than an hour away by automobile from Atlanta, Georgia, a designated global city and the cultural and economic center of the Atlanta metropolitan area, being in the top ten of the largest metropolitan areas in the nation. In the recent years, neighboring metro areas such as Gainesville, Georgia and metro Atlanta have experienced considerable growth. Although there have been many additions, changes, and augmentations, the University of Georgia's campus maintains its historic character. The historical practice has been to divide the main campus into two sections, North Campus and South Campus. Since 1995, new facilities serving the arts, academics, fitness and student housing have been built on what has come to be known as \\"East Campus.\\" This area includes new apartment-like dorms called East Campus Village. Adjacent is the newest and fourth dining hall on campus called the Village Summit at Joe Frank Harris Commons. Also on East campus is the Performing and Visual Arts Complex, the Ramsey Center for Physical Activity and the relocated Lamar Dodd School of Art. \\"West Campus\\" refers to the area adjacent to the main campus where many of UGA's largest residence halls are located; most freshmen live in one of the high-rise dorms on West Campus. Tradition maintains that UGA's oldest permanent building, Old College, is modeled on Yale University's Connecticut Hall.

Known as \\"The Arch\\" (but often erroneously pluralized to \\"The Arches\\"), the structure was patterned after the Seal of the State of Georgia, and has faced historic downtown Athens ever since it was erected in the 1850s. Although the Seal's three pillars represent the state's three branches of government, the pillars of The Arch are usually taken to represent the Georgia Constitution's three principles of wisdom, justice, and moderation, which are engraved over the pillars of the Seal. There is a superstition about walking through The Arch. It is said that if you walk under The Arch as an undergraduate student, you will not graduate from the University of Georgia on time. Another legend claims that should you walk through The Arch as a freshman, you will become sterile.Gibbs, C. (2010). God and Football: Faith and Fanaticism in the SEC. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

The Chicago-based district includes all or parts of East Side, Hyde Park, Kenwood, South Chicago, South Shore, and Woodlawn. Peters took office on January 6, 2019 to succeed Kwame Raoul.  Early life and career  Peters was born in Chicago, Illinois on April 26, 1985. His biological mother suffered from a substance abuse disorder, and he was raised by his adopted parents who worked as a social worker and a civil rights lawyer. He was born deaf and with a speech impediment, and regained full hearing ability at age 8 and full speech capability at age 12. He attended Kansas State University from 2004 to 2009. His initial engagement in electoral politics was during Toni Preckwinkle's successful campaign for Cook County Board President in 2010. He later worked for Groupon, before returning to politics as an organizer for the non-profit Chicago Votes. Prior to his appointment, Peters was the political director for Reclaim Chicago and the People's Lobby. The People's Lobby endorsed and mobilized on behalf of candidates including Kim Foxx in the 2016 Cook County State's Attorney election and Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. He also previously worked for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, and served as the political director for Daniel Biss' unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Illinois in 2018. He is a dues-paying member of both the People's Lobby and United Working Families.  Illinois State Senator (2019‚Äìpresent)  Peters was appointed to the Illinois State to represent the 13th district in January 2019, to replace outgoing Senator Kwame Raoul upon the latter's election as Attorney General of Illinois. Under Cook County's appointment process, the Democratic Party committeepeople in the area of the district received weighted votes in choosing Raoul's replacement; in this case, the largest weighted votes were held by alderman Leslie Hairston and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Upon his appointment, Peters signaled his commitment to continuing Raoul's emphasis on issues of bail reform and marijuana legalization. During the 2019-20 term, Peters was the chief co-sponsor of 13 bills that were signed into law, including legislation on banning private civil detention centers, ending \\"pay to stay\\" practices in correctional facilities, and expanding access to SNAP benefits, preventative HIV treatment, and apprenticeships for youth. He has cited improving the Department of Children and Family Services as a top legislative priority, and three of his co-sponsored bills focused on this agency, requiring expansion of post-adoption support services, collection of feedback from youth transitioning out of foster care, and provision of preventative care to reduce homelessness, incarceration, and unemployment. He served as the inaugural chair of the Senate's Special Committee on Public Safety. He is running for election to a full term in 2020, and faced a primary challenge from Ken Thomas. Both candidates agreed on most issues, but Thomas charged that Peters was appointed through a \\"backroom deal.\\" Peters was endorsed by a number of progressive organizations including United Working Families, Equality Illinois, and Reclaim Chicago, and most of his campaign contributions came from labor unions. Peters won the Democratic Party primary for the seat on March 17, 2020 with 52% of the vote.

The materials allowed by the ASME B&PV; Code have been historically limited to metallic materials only. Due to the success of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in other industries, nuclear power plants in the U.S. have expressed interest in using HDPE piping in ASME B&PV; Code applications. In 2008, the first U.S. nuclear power plant was approved by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (U.S. NRC) to install HDPE in an ASME B&PV; Code safety-related system. Since then, the rules for using HDPE have been integrated into the 2015 Edition and 2017 Edition of the ASME B&PV; Code. The NRC approval of the 2015 and 2017 Editions are still pending as of March 2019.

Code Case N-755 and the 2015 Edition of ASME B&PV; Code, Section III, Appendix XXVI are limited to butt fusion (i.e. hot plate welding) only. Electrofusion is included in the 2017 Edition of the ASME B&PV; Code, Section III, Appendix XXVI. Both N-755 and Appendix XXVI limit the use of HDPE to Class 3 piping systems.  Required examination and testing  All welds made with either hot plate welding or electrofusion welding are required to be visually inspected and have a hydrostatic pressure test. All joints in pipe 4 inches and large must have 100% volumetric non-destructive examination (NDE) performed. The volumetric NDE may be either ultrasonic examination or microwave examination.  Benefits  The steel piping used in service water systems at nuclear power plants are often subjected to various forms of degradation including general corrosion, microbiological induced corrosion, tuberculation, and galvanic corrosion. HDPE is typically impervious to these forms of degradation. Additionally, nuclear power plants typically have robust seismic requirements and HDPE is very flexible which increases its ability to survive an earthquake.  Challenges  The use of HDPE in nuclear power plants requires extensive qualification and testing efforts to demonstrate that the material is safe under all design basis conditions. The U.S. NRC has raised concerns in the past with the use of HDPE related to butt fusion joint integrity, the ability to detect flaws in joints, and the potential for slow crack growth. This has prevented the NRC from generically approving the use of HDPE. Nuclear Power plants can still request approval from the U.S. NRC on a case-by-case basis (i.e., relief request).  Current status of U.S. NRC approval  The NRC has reviewed the 2015 and 2017 Editions of the ASME B&PV; Code and is proposing acceptance and incorporation into 10CFR50.55a with the following five conditions related to the use of HDPE: # Butt fusion - Standardized Fusion Procedure Specifications cannot be used. A new Fusion Procedure Specification is required to be qualified for any change in the essential variables. Additionally, the following essential variables must be added to the ten current essential variables: #* Diameter #* Cross-sectional area (currently a nonessential variable) #* Ambient temperature #* Fusion machine carriage model # Butt fusion - Procedure qualification requires both bend testing and high-speed tensile impact testing. Section IX, QF-202.2.1 currently only requires sustained pressure testing and high-speed tensile impact testing. # Electrofusion - Standardized Fusion Procedure Specifications cannot be used. A new Fusion Procedure Specification is required to be qualified for any change in the essential variables. Additionally, the following essential variables must be added to the twelve current essential variables: #* Fitting polyethylene material #* Pipe wall thickness (currently a nonessential variable) #* Power supply (currently a nonessential variable) #* Processor (currently a nonessential variable) # Electrofusion - Procedure qualification requires both crush testing and bend testing. Section IX, Table QF-202.2.2 currently only requires either crush testing or bend testing depending on the pipe size and other conditions. This is in addition to sustained pressure testing, and quick burst pressure testing and others. # Electrofusion - Saddle fittings cannot be used. All fittings must be 360 degree (i.e., seamless).

Central Auckland was laid out by him. Felton Mathew Avenue was named after him, and is a difficult incline amongst the cycling community in Auckland. Early life Mathew was born at Goswell Street in London in 1801. Nothing is known about his upbringing or education. In 1829, he became engaged to his cousin Sarah Mathew, the sister of George Felton Mathew; George was a close friend to the poet John Keats. The cousins would marry in Sydney on 21 January 1832. They had no children but Sarah gave birth to several still-born. From soon after their wedding, they lived at Windsor on the Hawkesbury River. Career in Australasia In 1829, Felton Mathew arrived in New South Wales aboard Morley to take up appointment as Assistant-Surveyor of Roads and Bridges. In 1836, he was appointed by the Colonial Office in London as Town Surveyor at Sydney. Soon afterwards he turned down the position of Chief Surveyor at Port Phillip as he perceived the position less secure as it was a local position. This choice proved unfortunate for Mathew as in 1839, the Colonial Office decided that the Australian states should govern its own affairs and discontinued all appointments that it had made. It was at this point that Captain William Hobson arrived in Sydney and he offered Mathew the post of acting Surveyor-General of New Zealand. There are conflicting reports whether Mathew was given guarantees that this position be confirmed as permanent by the Colonial Office. In January 1840, the Mathews came to the Bay of Islands with Governor Hobson on . Mathew was on Herald with Hobson in the WaitematƒÅ Harbour looking for a site for the future Auckland when Hobson had the stroke which almost incapacitated him. Mathew made another exploratory trip, examining the WaitematƒÅ Harbour, and was with the first party of officials to settle in Auckland in September 1840. He travelled down to Wellington and back with Hobson's party in 1841. Later life and death The Mathews visited England in 1845 to clarify the status of his appointment. They returned in March 1847 and faced difficulties with Governor George Grey. They sold their house and possessions and in September 1847 left for England. He fell ill on the journey and died in Lima, Peru, where he had on account of his health had to leave the ship. His wife carried on to England and lived for the next decade in Sussex before she returned to New Zealand to sell their land holdings. Historian James Rutherford described Mathew as \\"industrious and conscientious\\" but that there is nothing to suggest that he \\"possessed any exceptional abilities as Surveyor\\". Mathew was widely mocked for his layout of the town of Auckland but Rutherford contends that this is mostly unjustified. Rutherford states that a valid criticism of Mathew is that he paid more attention to level building land than to deep water for shipping.

Professor Hasofer held the position of the Chair of Statistics within the Mathematics Department in the University of New South Wales in Sydney from 1969 to 1991. He subsequently held a position at the LaTrobe University in Melbourne. He authored a number of publications in the field of applied mathematics and civil engineering, including his formulation of the Hasofer-Lind Reliability Index.

In 1960 he earned a Bachelor of Science from the University of Tasmania, and in 1964, Hasofer earned his PhD in Mathematical Statistics from the University of Tasmania which was the first PhD degree earned in the university's Department of Mathematics. At the time, Hasofer was a Lecturer in the Department. Hasofer went on to become Professor of Statistics at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). He was chair of statistics within the Mathematics Department for much of his career. Hasofer received the status of emeritus professor at UNSW. Hasofer died in 2010. = Activities = Hasofer's work in mathematics included the formulation of the advanced statistical method known as the Hasofer-Lind Reliability Index which is recognized as an important step towards the development of contemporary methods to effectively and accurately estimate structural safety.Dudzik, A., and U.

Hasofer supported Dr Lee Spetner's stance on Neo-Darwinism which questioned the plausibility of the evolutionary theory of the appearance of beneficial mutations. Spetner's calculations of the probability of beneficial mutations led him to conclude that is unreasonable to assume that beneficial mutations can be produced even in a generous allocation of geological time.Hasofer, A.

While teaching at the Australian National University in Canberra, Hasofer researched notions of probability and random mechanisms discussed in Talmudic literature. According to Hasofer, the attitude of Ancient Israel toward chance mechanism was diametrically opposed to that of neighboring nations. Dice had been used for gambling as well as for divination in Greek and Roman temples, while Jews were forbidden and sanctioned for use of dice. Lots were used by Jews to settle disputes, as a fair method to allocate duties among contenders, among other uses.Hasofer, Abraham M. \\"Studies in the history of probability and statistics. XVI.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Evan-Thomas, to the north. Situated on the eastern boundary of Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, the peak is visible from Highway 40 and the Kananaskis Lakes area. Like so many of the mountains in Kananaskis Country, Mount Packenham received its name from the persons and ships involved in the 1916 Battle of Jutland, the only major sea battle of the First World War.Battle of Jutland Alberta Historic Places History The mountain was named in honor of Rear Admiral Sir William C. Pakenham (1861-1933), commander of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron during the Battle of Jutland in World War I. The mountain's name was made official in 1922 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada based on a misspelling of Pakenham's name made by the Interprovincial Boundary Commission. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1954 by N. Gish, Malcolm Dickson, P. Rainier, and S.G. Pearson. It has been suggested that this group was actually on Mount Evan-Thomas, which may make the first ascent be in 1972 by J. Pomeroy, M. Simpson and D. Forrest and G. Boles.Mount Packenham SummitPost Geology Mount Packenham is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Mount Packenham was created during the Lewis Overthrust. The steeply tilted strata are virtually the same in each peak of the Opal Range, with softer layers sandwiched between harder layers. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Packenham is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. In terms of favorable weather, June through September are the best months to climb Mount Packenham. Precipitation runoff from the west side of the mountain drains into the Kananaskis River, the east side drains into tributaries of the Elbow River, and then both of these merge into the Bow River, and finally into the Saskatchewan River.

The vocabulary was largely Swedish, and the grammar was simplified (little to no morphology). From the limited data that's been preserved, it's not obvious to what extent Borgarm√•let was a stable pidgin, as opposed to an ad hoc trade jargon. However, Yury Kuzmenko believes there is enough evidence to conclude that Borgarm√•let was a typical pidgin with a stable grammar.Jurij Kusmenko, 2017. Borgarm√•let: A S√°mi-Swedish pidgin from the beginning of the 18th century. NOWELE: North-Western European Language Evolution, 70:1. There was apparently some grammatical influence from the local Sami languages, such as conveying Sami grammatical aspectual distinctions by means of different Swedish words (that is, with lexical aspect). Specifically, the data preserves several Borgarm√•let verbs for 'to give', which seem to differ in the type of action. For example, 'you give me my skins and I'll give you your alcohol' uses two different verbs for 'give', stick and s√§tt, despite Borgarm√•let being a simplified language. Stick (from Swedish sticka 'to prick') apparently indicated a momentary action, s√§tt (from Swedish s√§tta 'to set') an inchoative action (the onset of giving), and kast (from Swedish kasta 'to throw') a subitive action (to give suddenly). In addition, sl√§pp (from Swedish sl√§ppa 'to release') appears to have been causative (to let give). These corresponded to grammatical distinctions required by Sami languages, but not by Swedish.Yury Kuzmenko, 2015.

It served as the high school for black students from 1919 until 1970 when the schools were integrated. From 1954 to 1966 the school educated black students from surrounding counties which closed their schools in 1954 to avoid having blacks and white attend the same schools. History In 1919, the Appomattox Training School for colored children was begun in the First Baptist Church of Appomattox, with funds partially provided by the Rosenwald foundation. As the enrollment grew, the moved to 27 acre site, with a building and three teachers who taught elementary through high school. In 1930, a new building was added. In 1934 the school was renamed George Washington Carver High School. In 1951, there was a significant expansion, with the addition of a gym, a cafeteria, and a dozen new classrooms. In 1952 the school was renamed Carver-Price High School after educator Mrs. Mozella Price, who taught there from 1919 until 1963. In 1954, the federal courts mandated that schools be integrated. Prince Edward County refused to cooperate, instead closing the public schools in an act known as massive resistance. The schools remained closed until 1964, and the number of students at Carver-Price swelled to over 50 per classroom, and many students from surrounding areas roomed in the home of Mozella Price in order to attend. Some students came from as far as 140 miles away. In 1964 an 11 room building was added. In February 1970, the schools were finally integrated, and Carver-Price was repurposed for grades 5-9, and was known as Appomattox Intermediate School. The school was abandoned in 2002, until 2008, the original four buildings have housed the Carver-Price Legacy Museum, funded by the Carver-Price Alumni Association.

Nerenberg was also the film's executive producer. The film proposes that willful ignorance (as opposed to what is commonly meant by stupidity, low mental capacity) has increasingly become a strategy for success in the realms of politics and entertainment, that is, the \\"stupid\\" things that seemingly smart people do every day. The film questions \\"why stupidity is such a slippery concept to grasp and why so few people are talking about it.\\" The film features songs by The Arrogant Worms and original music by The Morons. Synopsis The film traces the public fascination with perceived stupidity, from I.Q. tests in the early 1900s, to present-day silliness in the form of Jackass and boy bands. Nerenberg compares George W. Bush to Adam Sandler, arguing that the perception that Bush is unintelligent is as mistaken as identifying Sandler with the roles he plays in his films: both are in some sense playing to expectations from their respective audiences: \\"society prefers people who hide their acumen.\\" To back up his various theories, Nerenberg employs quotes from Noam Chomsky, American Psychological Association president Dr. Robert J. Sternberg (who wrote Why Smart People Can Be So Stupid), pundit Bill Maher, \\"who blames it all on youth culture\\", and former CNN and 20/20 producer Danny Schecter. Others who appear in the film include: John Cleese, Coolio, Drew Curtis, Salma Hayek, David Lawrence, Michael Moore, Geoff Pevere, Adam Sandler, Joel Schumacher, Paul Spence, Steve-O, and Josey Vogels. Production =Inspiration= In a podcast interview, Albert Nerenberg told Steve Paulson he was watching a \\"boring\\" documentary about intelligence when it occurred to him that stupidity would make a much more interesting film. He also said that the media has been dumbing itself down for a long time, and that he was tired of doing it himself. In his commentary for the director's cut Stupidity DVD, Nerenberg says the work itself began as an investigation of the popularity of the Jackass franchise. Nerenberg has been quoted as saying that he made Stupidity because no one had ever made a documentary about the subject before and that \\"obviously it's an important issue... while society ostensibly pretends to educate its citizens it appears to make them stupid.\\" =Filming= Reportedly \\"made for little money\\" (Nerenberg's Elevator Films website says it had a \\"modest TV hour budget\\"), much of the footage featuring off-the-cuff commentary by celebrities was obtained \\"by taking advantage of\\" attendees of the Toronto International Film Festival. Commentary on the DVD indicates that the film was shot using a 1.33:1 ratio, subsequently matted for the feature film to 1.85:1, affecting compositions in some areas. Release Stupidity was screened in theatres during the 10th annual Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto, at the Bloor Cinema on 1 May 2003 and on 3 May at the Royal Ontario Museum. Its American theatrical premiere took place in San Francisco on 1 March 2004, preceding a \\"limited run\\". The film had its UK premiere at the OxDox Film Festival at Oxford University on 25 and 26 October 2004, accompanied by panel discussions and debates. The goal of the symposium was to raise interest in a larger international conference in 2005. =Home media= A 77-minute director's cut DVD was released on 16 November 2004, with extended interviews of Jay Teitel, Jim Welles, Bill Maher, Giancarlo Livraghi, Noam Chomsky, Joel Schumacher, and Avital Ronewell, as well as a half-hour interview with director Nerenberg by Christina Pochmursky, commentary by Nerenberg, and an I.Q. test \\"to see just how stupid you are.\\" =Streaming= It has been available to stream from SnagFilms since 10 November 2009. Reception =Commercial performance= Stupidity was the biggest sellout (two sold-out shows) at the Hot Docs festival, a \\"runaway hit\\". According to data from the Motion Picture Theatres Association of Canada, the film was the highest grossing documentary film in the country in 2003, with C$29,472 in box office receipts, more than twice the takings of either of its next three competitors, √Ä hauteur d'homme, Sexe de rue, and La grande travers√©e, and about three times as much as the next six. =Critical response= On review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary currently has a score of 67% based on six reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. Lynne Fernie said the film \\"starts out as an entertaining romp through mass culture\\", quickly becoming \\"ominous\\", calling it hilarious, smart and \\"very scary\\". David Silverberg calls the film \\"intelligent\\", \\"thoughtful and entertaining\\", and appreciated its quick-cut editing and \\"visual playfulness\\", concluding that the film \\"attracted attention because it provoked discussion on how we view the reality we take for granted.\\" James Keast says Stupidity accomplishes its goals quite handily: \\"it's a delightfully engrossing film to watch, because for whatever reason we like it when other people do stupid things\\", referencing the Darwin Awards, and, \\"because, for such a moronic topic, it applies some serious intellectual rigour to the subject.\\" Jonathan Curiel calls the film \\"clever, hilarious and -- in its own stylish way -- ironic.\\" Curiel believes that the film is \\"balanced\\", despite Nerenberg's \\"obvious liberal views\\", citing his interview of former Bush speechwriter David Frum. Marc Savlov, assigning the film 3 stars out of 5, calls it an \\"amusing and horrifying documentary\\", which, were it stripped of Nerenberg's \\"hyperwit,\\" might have been \\"too depressing to watch.\\" Wendy Banks describes the film's \\"rapid-fire editing\\" and spoofy, Entertainment Tonight like aesthetic as \\"more a riff than an argument\\", and suggests \\"it raises more questions than it answers\\", but remains \\"an intriguing subject, both funny and scary, and Nerenberg attacks it full on with humour and moments of insight.\\" Christopher Null grants the film 3.5/6, saying the film is a frequently fascinating \\"but sometimes wandering work that provides some insight into the nature of dumbness\\", but ultimately Nerenberg pads out an already short movie with man- on-the-street interviews \\"that are really nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to make the average joe look, well, stupid.\\" Liam Lacey gives the documentary no stars, calling Stupidity \\"only a moderately stupid film\\", intentionally, but annoyingly, flippant, as well as \\"overproduced with gimmicky fast editing and speeded-up action\\", with needlessly unpleasant imagery, and abounding with wild, \\"and not very smart, generalizations\\"; Nerenberg fails to distinguish between \\"stupid and foolish\\". Reviewing the film for Variety, Dennis Harvey calls it \\"thinly amusing\\" but was otherwise not impressed: \\"A more deadpan, mock-solemn approach might have lent this concept a veneer of genuine wit\\", and Nerenberg's \\"jokey pastiche\\" is in \\"exactly the short-attention-span mode he decries in modern media.\\" Reviewing the film for Maclean's, Brian D. Johnson accuses the film of doing exactly what it decries: > Stupidity unfolds as a blitz of titillating images‚Äîcrazy stunts, streakers, > grossout gags, monster trucks, Dubya gaffes‚Äîintercut with soundbites by > everyone from Rick Mercer to Noam Chomsky. Less documentary than > \\"amusementary,\\" the film is the best evidence for its own message‚Äîthat > dumbing down is a smart strategy. In a culture where reality is faked, and > intelligence is the ultimate taboo, Stupidity fits right in. Lewis Black hosted the World Stupidity Awards in 2004 and 2005. =Accolade= *Best Documentary, Atlantic City Film Festival Marketing and related works The Documentary Organization of Canada, which founded the Hot Docs festival, hosted an event to celebrate the premiere of Stupidity at the Schmooze dance club on 1 May 2003. =World Stupidity Awards= Nerenberg founded the World Stupidity Awards, which took place on 6 June 2003, and were accompanied by a screening of Stupidity. Notable nominees included Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf, George W. Bush, Elsie Wayne and Mel Lastman. Comparing them to the Darwin Awards, which celebrate those who have purportedly killed themselves through acts of stupidity, Nerenberg said: \\"we believe the living stupid are far more influential and demand recognition\\". Starting in 2004, the awards were bestowed in Montr√©al, sponsored by the Just for Laughs festival, and hosted by Lewis Black. The media event introduced the category of Stupidest Statement of the Year and four others added to the original six for a total of eleven categories that year. Black returned to host the show in 2005, when the category of Stupidest Awards Show of the Year was added, and the show itself was declared the winner. The awards were presented again in 2006 and, for the last time, in 2007.

History While an older church was likely attached to an Augustinian convent, a new church was under construction in 1556, when the town was sacked by the Imperial troops under the Duke of Alba. Reconstruction proceeded until 1575, likely under the guidance and designs of Giovanni Antonio Dosi (called Dosio), who worked under Torquato Conti to rebuild the walls of Anagni. A subsequent reconstruction took place in the 18th-century. With the suppression of the monastic order in 1873, the church became a barrack for the Carabinieri. Presently, due to structural instability, the church is closed. The main altarpiece was a Madonna and Child with St Augustine attributed to the school of Carlo Maratta. On the side altars were canvases from the 19th century. A chapel dedicated to those fallen in the first world war was covered with photos of the soldiers.Comune of Anagni, entry on church.

History The National Basketball Association contracted after the 1949‚Äì1950 season, losing six teams: The Anderson Packers, Sheboygan Red Skins and Waterloo Hawks, all former NBL teams, jumped to the NPBL, while the Chicago Stags, Denver Nuggets and St. Louis Bombers folded. The league went from 17 teams to 11 before the 1950‚Äì1951 season started. Midway through the 1950‚Äì1951 season, the Washington Capitols folded as well, bringing the number of teams in the league down to ten. The National Professional Basketball League was formed around the former NBA/NBL teams, with teams added in new larger markets. The charter teams were the Sheboygan Redskins (former NBA/NBL), the Anderson Packers (former NBA/NBL), the Louisville Alumnites, and the Grand Rapids Hornets, in the East Division; and in the West Division, the Denver Refiners/Evansville Agogans, the Saint Paul Lights, the Kansas City Hi-Spots, and the Waterloo Hawks (former NBA/NBL). The St. Paul Lights of the National Professional Basketball League ended the 1950‚Äì51 season with a record of 4 wins and 19 losses, finishing third in the NPBL's West Division, behind the leading Waterloo Hawks (at 32-24, .667). Howie Schultz coached the team. The St. Paul franchise folded before the season ended, a fate shared by the Louisville Alumnites, Kansas City Hi-Spots and Grand Rapids Hornets, playing their last game on December 19, 1950, a 76-70 win over the Waterloo Hawks. After the Lights folded, professional basketball did not return to St. Paul. However, the Minnesota Timberwolves are a current NBA franchise in Minneapolis. The NPBL folded after the 1950‚Äì1951 Season. =The arena= The Hi-Spots played at the St. Paul Auditorium, known today as Roy Wilkins Auditorium. Today, the arena in use as part of the RiverCentre complex, down the corridor from the Xcel Energy Center, home of the National Hockey League's Minnesota Wild. Roy Wilkins Auditorium is located at 175 W. Kellogg Boulevard, St. Paul, Minnesota.

The hairs on a gilder's tip are usually made of either blue squirrel hair or the hair of a badger (sometimes other hairs are also used, such as that of a camel) arranged in a single or double row along a flat ferrule made of wood or cardboard. In order to transfer the gold leaf, the hairs are first given a very light coating of adhesive by brushing them against a surface such as the back of the user's hand which has been coated with a thin layer of petroleum jelly (a common misconception is that static electricity causes the gold foil to attach to the brush, but this is not so) and then laying the edge of the brush along the edge of the piece of metal foil. The jelly will cause the metal to adhere very gently to the hairs and allow the piece to be floated from the paper surface on which had previously been stored. Because the leaf is so thin, this must be done in a room with extremely still air, and the user of the tip usually does not breathe until the leaf is in place. Once the leaf has settled, it is often burnished with polished piece of agate to achieve a high degree of brilliance. Gilder's tips are necessary because touching the metal leaf with the finger tips would immediately cause the leaf to lose its coherent flattened shape and crumble irretrievably into metallic dust which then cannot be used for any purpose.

Nubri is largely undocumented and undescribed, with the exception of a lexicon. Nubri is perhaps most closely related to neighbouring Tsum language and the Kyirong variety of Tibetan spoken just across the border in Tibet. It has also been claimed to be closely related to Gyalsumdo. Like these languages it is tonal and shares many Tibetic grammatical features, but is uniquely different in many ways.

This period of Chinese history is noteworthy for the introduction of gunpowder weapons and as a transitional phase from the aristocratic imperial system to the Confucian bureaucracy which characterized the Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Five Dynasties Later Liang in 907 AD Later Tang in 926 AD Later Jin in 939 AD Later Han in 949 AD Later Zhou in 951 AD Song dynasty's conquest of China =Later Liang (907‚Äì923)= The Later Liang dynasty was founded by Zhu Wen. Zhu Wen was originally a rebel during the Huang Chao rebellion but later surrendered to the Tang dynasty and served under the military commander Li Keyong. In 904, Zhu Wen kidnapped Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, took him to Luoyang, and killed him. Three years later he also disposed of Emperor Ai of Tang, ending the Tang dynasty, and proclaimed his own dynasty of Liang. Zhu Wen undertook several military campaigns and failed in all of them. Despite lowering taxes to win support of the common folk, he is remembered in history as a brutal and ruthless tyrant. Zhu Wen was killed by his own son in 912, who was in turn killed by his brother a year later. The last ruler of Later Liang, Zhu Youzhen, ruled until 923 when Li Keyong's son Li Cunxu conquered the Liang capital Kaifeng. =Jin/Later Tang (883‚Äì936)= The Later Tang was originally Jin under Li Keyong, a Tang military commander of Shatuo descent. When Li Keyong died in 908, his son Li Cunxu picked up where his father left off, conquering Yan in 913 and eventually also Later Liang in 923, at which point he proclaimed the new Tang dynasty. The state of Qi submitted to Later Tang in 923. In 925, Later Tang conquered Former Shu. Li Cunxu was killed in the next year during a rebellion by one of his officers, and his adopted son Li Siyuan succeeded him. In 936, Li Cunxu's son-in-law, Shi Jingtang, rebelled with the aid of the Khitans and overthrew Later Tang, forming his own Later Jin dynasty. =Later Jin (937‚Äì947)= In return for their aid in toppling the Later Tang dynasty, Shi Jingtang turned over Sixteen Prefectures to the Khitans. After Shi Jingtang died in 942, Jing Yanguang took over government affairs for the young emperor Shi Chonggui. Jing Yanguang offended the Khitans, who invaded Later Jin in 945. The Jin General Fu Yanqing went out to meet them. The Khitans set fire to the land with blowing towards the Jin in order to force them into combat, but the Jin under Fu Yanqing had already advanced on the Khitan position and pinned them with infantry. A contingent of Shatuo cavalry attacked the Khitans in the flank and routed them. In 947 the Khitans invaded again and sacked Kaifeng, ending the dynasty. However the Khitan army met heavy opposition from the locals, forcing them to forage for food. Seeing that the conditions did not favor outright conquest, the Khitans retreated north, proclaiming their own Liao dynasty. The power vacuum left in their wake was filled by Liu Zhiyuan, who proclaimed himself Emperor of Han. =Later Han (947‚Äì951)= The Later Han dynasty was founded by Liu Zhiyuan in 947. He died the following year and his son Liu Chengyou was overthrown by Guo Wei in 951. =Later Zhou (951‚Äì960)= Guo Wei founded Later Zhou in 951. Guo Wei spent his short lived reign implementing reforms to lessen the burdens of the common folk. He also launched campaigns against Northern Han twice, in 952 and 954, but was thwarted both times by the Liao dynasty. He died in 954. His successor and adopted son, Chai Rong, launched a campaign against Buddhism. In 955, Later Zhou invaded Southern Tang and forced it to cede 14 prefectures as well as forced the aggressive Later Shu in the west to back off. Chai Rong attempted to invade the Liao dynasty in 959, but fell ill and died on campaign. His son Guo Zongxun was usurped by Zhao Kuangyin (Emperor Taizu of Song) in 960, thus ending the Five Dynasties. Ten Kingdoms =Former Shu (907‚Äì925)= Wang Jian was a regional inspector of Bizhou. In 891 he occupied Chengdu. By 902, he had conquered region of Hanzhong. In 907, Wang declared himself emperor of Shu (Former Shu) and began expanding the territory of his dominion in the north. Wang Jian's son and successor, Wang Yan (r. 918‚Äì925), squandered his father's achievements and spent enormous resources on building palaces while the heir apparent, Wang Yuanying, was killed in a fight. In 925, Wang Yan was captured by Later Tang and killed. His territory was left in the care of jiedushi Meng Zhixiang, who went on to found Later Shu. =Later Shu (934‚Äì965)= The former territory of Former Shu was overseen by jiedushi Meng Zhixiang, who asserted his independence in 932 by killing the jiedushi of Dongchuan, Dong Zhang, thereby conquering all of Sichuan. He declared himself emperor in 934 and died immediately afterwards. When the Khitans destroyed the Later Jin in 946, Later Shu occupied three prefectures to the north. Meng Zhixiang's successor, Meng Chang, also expanded to the northwest but lost all his gains to Later Zhou in 955. In 965, Meng Chang surrendered to the Song dynasty. =Yang Wu (907‚Äì937)= Yang Xingmi, born in 852, was a man of common origin. As a regional inspector of Luzhou, Yang displayed military talent during several campaigns against various warlords such as Gao Pian, Qin Yan, Bi Shiduo, and Sun Ru. In 892, Yang was promoted to jiedushi of Huainan. He engaged in several campaigns with Later Liang in the north and Wuyue in the southeast, expanding his territory considerably. He is also one of the first people recorded to have (possibly) used gunpowder in warfare. In 902, Yang became Pring of Wu, and died three years later. His son and successor, Yang Wo, was controlled by the generals Zhang Hao and Xu Wen, who murdered him in 908. Xu Wen then killed Zhang Hao and became de facto ruler, enthroning Yang Longyan in 919. Xu Wen's foster son, Xu Zhigao, deposed Yang Longyan's successor, Yang Pu, in 937 and founded the state of Southern Tang (937‚Äì976), originally Great Qi. =Southern Tang (937‚Äì976)= When Xu Zhigao deposed Yang Pu in 937, he originally declared his state that of the Great Qi. A year later he renamed it Tang (Southern Tang). Xu also renamed himself to Li Bian. Li Bian's rule was characterized by peaceful diplomacy, favoring trade rather than war. Li instituted the Taixue and carried out state examinations to select competent officials. His son, Li Jing (r. 943‚Äì960), invaded Min in 945 and annexed its western territories while Wuyue took the northern parts, and Liu Congxiao was appointed jiedushi of the remaining territory. In 951, Southern Tang invaded Ma Chu and annexed the majority of its territory, with remnants surviving under the Wuping Jiedushi. In 955, Later Zhou invaded Southern Tang and forced it to cede 14 prefectures. Li Jing's son, Li Yu (r. 961‚Äì975), was uninterested in politics and spent his time writing poetry, practicing calligraphy, and playing musical instruments. In 976, the Song dynasty annexed Southern Tang. =Wuyue (907‚Äì978)= In 893, Qian Liu became jiedushi of Haijun. As jiedushi, Qian Liu defeated Dong Chang, the surveillance commissioner of Yu√®zh≈çu, who planned on declaring himself emperor. For his victory, Qian was awarded the posts of jiedushi of Zhenhai and Donghai as well. In 907, Qian Liu proclaimed himself Prince of Wuyue and moved his capital to Hangzhou. Wuyue was a militarily weak state that thrived on producing silk, paper, and porcelain. They accepted the suzerainty of Later Liang and its successors. In 940, Wuyue invaded Min but was defeated. In 946, Wuyue succeeded in invading Min and conquered its capital of Fuzhou. In 978, the last ruler of Wuyue, Qian Chu, surrendered to the Song dynasty. =Min (909‚Äì945)= Min was founded by the rebels Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi, who conquered Quanzhou in 886 and Fuzhou in 893. In 909, Wang Shenzhi became Prince of Min. Situated in a political and economic backwater, the rulers of Min tried to attract scholars to build an effective administration, but fell into familial bickering and ended up being destroyed by the Southern Tang in 945. The jiedushi of Qingyuan (Quanzhou) however continued to rule independently until the area was conquered by the Song dynasty in 978. =Southern Han (917‚Äì971)= Southern Han was founded by the brothers Liu Yin and Liu Yan. Liu Yin's father, Liu Qian, was the regional inspector of Fengzhou. When he died, Liu Yin succeeded his post, and was made jiedushi of Qinghai in 905. When the Tang dynasty collapsed in 907, the Liu brothers took in refugees from the north and used them to establish an independent realm. Liu Yin died in 911 and his brother succeeded him. Liu Yan proclaimed the Great Yue in 917, but then changed the name to Han a year later. Southern Han invaded Annan in 930 and removed the Kh√∫c clan from power. The Southern Han general Liang Kezhen raided Champa's capital, Indrapura, but the Southern Han themselves were defeated by D∆∞∆°ng ƒê√¨nh Ngh·ªá a year later. In 937, Ki·ªÅu C√¥ng Ti·ªÖn killed D∆∞∆°ng ƒê√¨nh Ngh·ªá and called Southern Han into a war against rebels to the south, however ƒê√¨nh Ngh·ªá's son-in-law Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn murdered C√¥ng Ti·ªÖn and defeated the Southern Han fleet at the Battle of B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng in 938. In 948, Southern Han invaded Ma Chu, taking 10 prefectures. During the reign of Liu Chang (958‚Äì971), the court was dominated by eunuchs, and the state fell into decline. The Southern Han army kept a permanent corps of war elephants. When the Song dynasty invaded in 970, their crossbowmen readily routed the Southern Han elephants. This was the last time elephants were used in Chinese warfare. In 971, Liu Chang surrendered to the Song dynasty. The state of Southern Han was characterized by a civilian government that organized state examinations to recruit officials, but it also taxed its common folks harshly to build palace complexes such as the Zhaoyang Hall with its golden roof. =Jingnan (924‚Äì963)= Gao Jixing was a servant under the army of Zhu Wen. When he was made jiedushi of Jingnan, he began plotting to claim his independence. When Later Liang was destroyed by Later Tang in 923, Gao was made Prince of Nanping, where he increased his territory by a modest amount. The state of Jingnan was small and weak, paying obeisance to stronger states north and south. Gao Jixing's successor, Gao Conghui, was known as \\"Gao the Unreliable\\" for sending tribute missions to various realms both north and south. Jingnan was conquered by the Song dynasty in 963. =Ma Chu (926‚Äì951)= Ma Chu was founded by an officer by the name of Ma Yin who served under the generals Sun Ru and Liu Jianfeng. When Liu Jianfeng died in 896, the Tang court made Ma Yin the jiedushi of Hunan. After the collapse of the Tang in 907, Ma Yin was made Prince of Chu, a vassal of the northern dynasties. Under the reign of Ma Yin, Chu remained at peace with neighboring powers and traded tea. Ma Chu was conquered by the Southern Tang in 951. =Northern Han (948‚Äì979)= Northern Han was founded by Liu Chong, a Shatuo T√ºrk, the jiedushi of Hedong Circuit and Taiyuan. In 951, Guo Wei rebelled and defeated Emperor Yin of Later Han. He then killed Liu Chong's son, Liu Yun, and proclaimed the Later Zhou, leaving Liu Chong as emperor of Northern Han. Northern Han forged an alliance with the Khitan Liao dynasty and participated in an invasion of Later Zhou, but was defeated and besieged by Zhou forces at Taiyuan for more than a month. In 979, the Song dynasty annexed Northern Han. Other states Liu Shouguang's Yan was conquered by Later Tang in 913. Li Maozhen's Qi submitted to Later Tang in 923. Gunpowder weapons Earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the Wujing Zongyao of 1044 AD. =Origins= Gunpowder was discovered in China sometime during the first millennium AD. The very earliest possible reference to gunpowder appeared in 142 AD during the Eastern Han dynasty when the alchemist Wei Boyang wrote about a substance with the properties of gunpowder. He described a mixture of three powders that would \\"fly and dance\\" violently in his Cantong qi, otherwise known as the Book of the Kinship of Three, a Taoist text on the subject of alchemy. Although it is impossible to know if he was actually referring to gunpowder, no other explosive known to scientists is composed of three powders. While it was almost certainly not their intention to create a weapon of war, Taoist alchemists continued to play a major role in gunpowder development due to their experiments with sulfur and saltpeter involved in searching for eternal life and ways to transmute one material into another. Historian Peter Lorge notes that despite the early association of gunpowder with Taoism, this may be a quirk of historiography and a result of the better preservation of texts associated with Taoism, rather than being a subject limited to only Taoists. The Taoist quest for the elixir of life attracted many powerful patrons, one of whom was Emperor Wu of Han. One of the resulting alchemical experiments involved heating 10% sulfur and 75% saltpeter to transform them. The next reference to gunpowder occurred in the year 300 during the Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420). A Taoist philosopher by the name of Ge Hong wrote down the ingredients of gunpowder in his surviving works, collectively known as the Baopuzi (\\"The Master Who Embraces Simplicity\\"). The \\"Inner Chapters\\" on Taoism contains records of his experiments with heated saltpeter, pine resin, and charcoal among other carbon materials, resulting in explosion, which most historians acknowledge as an early form of gunpowder. In 492, Taoist alchemists noted that saltpeter, one of the most important ingredients in gunpowder, burns with a purple flame, allowing for practical efforts at purifying the substance. The first confirmed reference to what can be considered gunpowder in China occurred during the Tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue (Â§™‰∏äËÅñÁ•ñÈáë‰∏πÁßòË®£) in 808, and then about 50 years later in a Taoist text known as the Zhenyuan miaodao yaol√ºe (ÁúüÂÖÉÂ¶ôÈÅìË¶ÅÁï•). The first formula was a combination of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb. The Taoist text warned against an assortment of dangerous formulas, one of which corresponds with gunpowder: \\"Some have heated together sulfur, realgar (arsenic disulphide), and saltpeter with honey; smoke [and flames] result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house burned down.\\" Alchemists called this discovery fire medicine (\\"huoyao\\" ÁÅ´Ëó•), and the term has continued to refer to gunpowder in China into the present day, a reminder of its heritage as a side result in the search for longevity increasing drugs. =Fire arrow= An arrow strapped with gunpowder ready to be shot from a bow. From the Huolongjing At this point the formula contained too little saltpeter (about 50%) to be explosive, but the mixture was highly flammable, and contemporary weapons reflected this in their deployment as mainly shock and incendiary weapons. One of the first, if not the first of these weapons was the fire arrow. The first possible reference to the use of fire arrows was by the Yang Wu in 904 during the siege of Yuzhang. An officer under Yang Xingmi by the name of Zheng Fan (ÈÑ≠Áí†) ordered his troops to \\"shoot off a machine to let fire and burn the Longsha Gate,\\" after which he and his troops dashed over the fire into the city and captured it, and he was promoted to Prime Minister Inspectorate for his efforts and the burns his body endured.Â§©‰ΩëÂàùÔºåÁéãËåÇÁ´†ÂæÅÂÆâ‰ªÅ‰πâ‰∫éÊ∂¶Â∑ûÔºåÊ¥éÂüéÈô∑Ôºå‰∏≠ÂçÅ‰ΩôÂàõÔºå‰ª•ÂäüËøÅÂ∑¶ÂÖàÈîãÈÉΩÂ∞â„ÄÇ‰ªéÊîªË±´Á´†ÔºåÔºàÈÉëÔºâÁí†‰ª•ÊâÄÈÉ®ÂèëÊú∫„ÄåÈ£ûÁÅ´„ÄçÔºåÁÉßÈæôÊ≤ôÈó®ÔºåÁéáÂ£ÆÂ£´Á™ÅÁÅ´ÂÖàÁôªÂÖ•ÂüéÔºåÁÑ¶ÁÅºË¢´‰ΩìÔºå‰ª•ÂäüÊéàÊ£ÄÊ†°Âè∏Âæí„ÄÇ(Rough Translation: During the beginning of Tianyou Era (904‚Äì907), Zheng Fan followed Wang Maozhang under a campaign of Runzhou, which was guarded by rebel An Renyi, he was severely injured by the time it was captured, as the result he was promoted as the Junior General of Left Vanguard. At the campaign of Yuchang, he ordered his troops to propel the \\"flying fire\\" on the besieged city, after the city-gate of Longsha was burnt, he led his troops dashed over the fire and entered the city, his body was scorched, as the result he was promoted as the Prime Minister of Inspectorate.) Records of Nine Kingdoms ch. 2 A later account of this event in the Hu Qian Jing (Tiger Seal Manual) written from 977 to 1004 corroborated with the report and explained that \\"by let fire (È£õÁÅ´) is meant things like firebombs and fire arrows.\\" Arrows carrying gunpowder were possibly the most applicable form of gunpowder weaponry at the time. Early gunpowder may have only produced an effective flame when exposed to oxygen, thus the rush of air around the arrow in flight would have provided a suitable catalyst for the reaction. The first fire arrows were arrows strapped with gunpowder incendiaries, but in 969 two Song generals, Yue Yifang and Feng Jisheng (È¶ÆÁπºÂçá), invented a variant fire arrow which utilized gunpowder tubes as propellants. Afterwards fire arrows started transitioning to rocket propelled weapons rather than being fired from a bow. These fire arrows were shown to the emperor in 970 when the head of a weapons manufacturing bureau sent Feng Jisheng to demonstrate the gunpowder arrow design, for which he was heavily rewarded. In 975, the state of Wuyue sent to the Song dynasty a unit of soldiers skilled in the handling of fire arrows. In the same year, the Song dynasty used fire arrows and incendiary bombs to destroy the fleet of Southern Tang. =Flamethrower= Chinese flamethrower from the Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044 AD, Song Dynasty. The text reads from top to bottom: ignition chamber, horizontal tank, piston rod, and fierce-fire oil tank cabinet installed form. According to Joseph Needham, the Chinese flamethrower which appeared during this era also used gunpowder as an igniter and was the first appearance of the slow match. The Chinese flamethrower, also known as \\"the Fierce-fire Oil Cabinet\\" (Chinese: ÁåõÁÅ´Ê≤πÊ´É mƒõng hu«í y√≥u gu√¨), used a double-piston pump to shoot naphtha. It was first recorded to have been used in China in 919. Wu Renchen's Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms states that in 917 AD, the king of Wuyue sent fierce fire oil to the Khitans as a gift. The envoy explained that it could be used to attack cities and the Khitan ruler was delighted. The History of Liao gives an extended version of the account: According to Lin Yu's Wu-Yue Beishi (Âê≥Ë∂äÂÇôÂè≤, \\"The History of Wu and Yue\\"), the next appearance of fierce fire oil occurred in 919 AD when the two fleets of Wuyue and Wu met in battle. In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River), the Wuyue fleet under Qian Chuanguan brought with them more than 500 dragon-like battleships and used \\"fire oil\\" to burn the enemy fleet. It was a great victory and they destroyed more than 400 enemy ships as well as capturing more than 7,000 men. Lin Yu goes on to explain appearance of the new weapon and the device used to deploy it: Flamethrowers were also recorded to have been used in 976 AD when Song naval forces confronted the Southern Tang fleet on the Changjiang. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction. =Fire lance= First illustration of Fire Lance and a Grenade, 10th Century, Dunhuang. Appears to be a detail from an illustration of Sakyamuni's temptation by Mara, with the demons at upper right threatening with the fire lance and other weapons while those at lower right tempt with pleasures. The fire lance was first depicted in a silk banner painting dating to the mid-10th century. Although most Chinese scholars reject the appearance of the fire lance prior to the Jin-Song wars, a Song text from 1000 and the Wujing Zongyao do make brief mentions of the fire lance. The fire lance, as implied by the name, is essentially a long spear or pole affixed with a tube of gunpowder, and as it saw more usage, the tube's length became longer and pellets were added to the composition. The earliest confirmed employment of the fire lance in warfare was by Song dynasty forces against the Jin in 1132 during the siege of De'an (modern Anlu, Hubei Province). References Bibliography * .

By studying the professions, income levels, ages, sexes and religions of trustees, Beck found that most of them were wealthy Protestant male businessmen, bankers or lawyers over 60. Beck argued that the trustees lacked an understanding of the working class or the under-privileged, and he added that they had no experience with teaching or academic research or administration. In a review for The Elementary School Journal, Thomas H. Hamilton of the University of Chicago agreed with Beck that the trustees' social status might be a problem, but he did not believe that appointing trustees with teaching or research experience would necessarily lead to better decisions. He added that the topic was under-researched and that the book was \\"a competent volume.\\" Reviewing it for the American Sociological Review, Scott Nearing concluded, \\"His study substantiates and documents the oft-repeated observation that the same men who run the banks and factories and operate the railroads of the United States also control and direct the institutions of higher education.\\" Personal life and death Beck married Dorothy Fahs, the daughter of Unitarian activist Sophia Lyon Fahs.

The story is set in the fictitious town of Riversend in New South Wales during a period of intense drought, and revolves around a small-town priest who kills five of his parishioners before being shot himself, and a journalist's investigation into his motivations. The novel is a crime thriller told in third person present tense. It has been optioned for television.  Plot  Charismatic priest Byron Swift is a hero in Riversend, an isolated town plagued by an intense drought. He leads various community groups and is generally regarded as a dedicated pillar of the community. One Sunday morning, he calmly and without apparent provocation shoots five members of his parish on the steps of the local church. Minutes later, he is shot and killed by a local police officer. One year on, Martin Scarsden - a troubled journalist - has been dispatched to Riversend to write an anniversary piece on how the crime has impacted the town. As he interviews locals, he learns that the accepted version of events - as reported by his own newspaper - may not be as accurate as initially believed.  Reception  The book has met with generally positive reviews - the Sydney Morning Herald described it as a work of \\"remarkable breadth and depth\\". with other publications calling it stunning and a brilliant debut . The book's detailed setting (aided by research for Hammer's previous non- fiction book, The River) is emblematic of the isolation and drought experienced in many rural Australian communities; one publication described it as \\"full of Australianness\\". Hammer was awarded the 2019 John Creasey (New Blood) Dagger by the UK Crime Writers' Association for the book.

Floating drydocks then rise up under the ship raising the ship out of the water. The ship is now blocked on the deck of the floating dry dock for repair. Most floating drydocks had no engine and are towed by tugboats to locations. Floating dry docks come in a different sizes to accommodate varying ship sizes. The large floating drydocks come in sections and can be assembled together to increase the size and lift power. Ballast pontoons tanks are flooded with water to submerge or pumped dry to raise the ship.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia, Floating Dry DocksBuilding the Navy's Bases in World War II, History of the Bureau of Yards and Docks and the Civil Engineer Corps 1940-1946 Chapter IX, Floating Drydocks World War 2 When World War 2 started the US Navy had only three steel auxiliary floating dry docks: To reduce travel time for repair work, over 150 auxiliary floating dry docks of different sizes were built during World War 2, between 1942 and 1945. These new floating dry docks built had a 400 to 100,000 ton lift capacity. Without these forward repair bases, ships would have to return to the states for repair. Between 1 October 1944 and 17 October 1945 7,000 ships were repaired in auxiliary floating dry docks. After World War 2 some of the auxiliary floating dry docks were sold for private use and a few were scrapped. Timber floating dry docks were built also for World War 2. These Timber floating dry docks had a lift capacity from 400 to 20,000 tons. These were not towed across the open ocean and were not given a US Navy class. Role Ships in continuous use during war need repair both from wear and from war damage such as naval mines, kamikaze attacks, dive bombs and torpedoes. Rudders and propellers are best serviced on dry docks. Without remote on location dry docks, months could be lost in a ship returning to a home port for repair. Most auxiliary floating drydock had provisions for the repair crew, such bunk beds, meals, and laundry. Most had power stations, ballast pumps, repair shops, machine shops, and mess halls to be self-sustaining. Some of the auxiliary floating drydocks also had provisions for the ship under repair, but when possible, the crew of the damaged ship remained on their ship while repair was being made. Many had cranes able to lift tons of material and parts for removing damage parts and install new parts.USS ABSD-1 [1943-1946] Armament Most auxiliary floating drydocks only have anti-aircraft guns for defense, as space would not allow for large guns. Typical armament were 40 mm and 20 mm machine guns. Japanese pilots sometime mistook empty auxiliary floating drydocks for a type of aircraft carrier.\\"Sea Going Navy Yard Follows The Fleet\\", November 1945, Popular Science Large Auxiliary Floating Dry Docks (AFDB) USS AFDB-3 with rail traveling 15-ton crane Auxiliary Floating Docks, Big, came in sections that are 3,850 tons and are 93 feet long each. Each Section had a 165 feet beam, a 75 feet molded depth and had 10,000 tons lifting capacity each. They are also known as Advance Base Sectional Docks (ABSD). Sections could be put together to lift larger ships. AFDB were needed to repair battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and large auxiliary ships. AFDB-1 Artisan had 10 sections (A to J) for a total lift of 100,000 tons and was 1,000 feet long with all 10 sections installed. AFDB-1 to 7 were built between 1943 and 1945 and then towed to remote navy bases. An AFDB would have a crew of 600 to 1000 men, have a fresh-water distilling plant and be self- sustaining. They had a rail traveling 15-ton capacity crane with an 85-foot radius and two or more support barges. To pump out the water in the tanks there were two 24-inch discharge pumps on each section, each pump rated 15,000 gpm. For power there were two 350-kw diesel AC generators on each section, producing 440 volts 3-phase 60-cycle power. Had steam plants to run the pumps. Each section could store 65,000 gal. of fuel oil, this was to supply the ships under repair.

It measures the optical aberrations of an optical wavefront. This wavefront sensor uses a pyramidal prism with a large apex angle to split the beam into multiple parts at the geometric focus of a lens. A four-faceted prism, with its tip centered at the peak of the point spread function, will generate four identical pupil images in the absence of optical aberrations. In the presence of optical aberrations, the intensity distribution among the pupils will change. The local wavefront gradients can be obtained by recording the distribution of intensity in the pupil images. The wavefront aberrations can be evaluated from the estimated wavefront gradients. It has potential applications in astronomy and ophthalmology.  Modulation  The prism is often modulated (mechanically moved in a circle/square) for averaging purposes and to make sure that the ray spends an equal fraction of the total time on every face of the pyramidal prism. This makes the wavefront sensor slightly inconvenient to use due to the need for mechanically moving parts ‚Äì either the prism or the beam is modulated. Using a light diffusing plate, mechanically moving parts can be eliminated. Alternatively, it has been shown that the need for mechanically moving parts can be overcome in a digital pyramid wavefront sensor with the spatial light modulator.

The song was released as a single by Sony Masterworks on January 9, 2019. Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell co-wrote it, while the latter handled production. Musically an electronic track with lullaby-influenced instrumentation, the lyrics of the song were heavily inspired by the critically acclaimed 2018 film Roma. Eilish's lyrics address misery, while she uses impressions of singing underwater. \\"When I Was Older\\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with one of them likening the lyrical content. The song reached number 11 on the US Billboard Alternative Digital Song Sales chart. It was performed live during Eilish's When We All Fall Asleep Tour and Where Do We Go? World Tour in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Background and release On January 8, 2019, Eilish announced the release date of \\"When I Was Older\\". She stated that the song's title was inspired from a piece of dialogue spoken by the character Pepe: \\"When I was older I used to be a sailor, but I drowned in a storm.\\" Eilish revealed the 2018 movie Roma, which was directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n and described as \\"domestic worker‚Äôs journey set against domestic and political turmoil in 1970s Mexico\\", as a major inspiration behind the song. \\"When I Was Older was released for digital download and streaming through record label Sony Masterworks on January 9, 2019 in various countries.Citations regarding the digital release of \\"When I Was Older\\" in various countries:  Although, \\"When I Was Older\\" was not in the movie. It was chosen by Cuar√≥n to appear on the album Music Inspired by the Film Roma on February 8, 2019. The song was later included on the Japanese edition of Eilish's debut studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? in December 2019. \\"When I Was Older\\" was written by the singer and her brother Finneas O'Connell, and he also produced it. Mastering and mixing was handled by studio personnel, John Greenham and Rob Kinelski, respectively. Composition and lyrical interpretation \\"When I Was Older\\" is moderately slow at 72-76 beats per minute (BPM). The song is played in the key of B minor, while Eilish's vocals span a range of E3 to A4. It has been described as a lullaby-influenced uptempo-electronic track in press reviews. Derrick Rossignol of Uproxx said the song starts with \\"eerie\\" instrumentation consisting of \\"some bass and simple percussion\\". Patrick Hosken of MTV has compared \\"the gloomy, blippy\\" track to Lil Uzi Vert's \\"XO TOUR Llif3\\" (2017) and Radiohead's \\"Pyramid Song\\" (2001). According to Eilish in a statement, \\"We wanted to write from within the narrative of the movie and the scenes that struck us the most from it. Having access to the sounds used in the film proved to be invaluable to help us convey this.‚Äù Wandera Hussein of The Fader said of Eilish's auto-tuned vocals coming in that it has a \\"drenched murmur over a sparse, tingly melody\\", giving the impression she‚Äôs singing underwater, while sounds of the ocean are overplayed in the chorus, sounding like she is wanting to be there: ‚ÄúWhen I was older/I was a sailor on an open sea/But now I'm underwater/And my skin is paler than it should ever be.\\" Lines like \\"Memories burn like a forest fire/Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud/In the flood\\" are accompanied by the sounds of trees burning in the woods outside of a house. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone noted that Eilish added sounds of \\"student protest shouts and Borras barking\\" and turned them into \\"rhythmic percussive elements to help drive the song\\". Reception and promotion \\"When I Was Older\\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Idolator's Mike Nied said the song was a \\"standout\\" and \\"shaping up to be a rather menacing anthem\\". Rolling Stone Angie Martoccio and Billboard Angelica Acevedo called it \\"haunting\\". Rossignol stated that the song is \\"pretty neat\\". Tom Breihan of Stereogum stated that it is hard to see how \\"When I Was Older\\" has anything to do with Roma, although wrote its \\"themes of alienation might have some resonance\\" and called the track a \\"weirdly pretty song\\". Chris William of Variety praised the track for the lyrics, calling them \\"impressive\\" and also noted its \\"preternatural spookiness\\". Pitchfork editor Philip Sherburne described it as \\"gorgeous\\" and one of the soundtrack's best songs, noting that while its sound \\"couldn't be further from Mexico City of the 1970s\\", its thematic closeness to the film made it \\"a fitting contemporary extrapolation\\". \\"When I Was Older\\" experienced limited success on record charts. It peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Alternative Digital Song Sales chart, number 7 on the New Zealand Hot Singles Chart, number 3 on the Sweden Heatseeker chart, and number 9 on the Dutch Tip Single charts.

This orchid occurs from Papuasia to northern Queensland.  Description  Thrixspermum platystachys is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb that forms untidy, pendulous clumps with many thin wiry roots and flattened stems long. It has between five and ten stiff, leathery leaves long and wide in two ranks. The flowers are fragrant, star-shaped, cream-coloured, long and wide arranged on a flattened, wiry flowering stem long. The sepals are long and about wide, the petals shorter and narrower. The labellum is orange and white, about long and wide with three lobes. The side lobes are about erect, about long and wide and the middle lobe is short and fleshy with a spur about long. Flowering occurs sporadically. Taxonomy and naming The starry hairseed was first formally described in 1886 by Frederick Bailey who gave it the name Sarcochilus platystachys and published the description in a supplement to A Synopsis of the Queensland Flora from a specimen collected by Thomas Bancroft near the Johnstone River. In 1911, Rudolf Schlechter changed the name to Thrixspermum platystachys. The specific epithet (platystachys) is derived from the ancient Greek words () meaning \\"broad\\" or \\"flat and () meaning \\"ear of grain\\".Backer, C.A. (1936).

After burning 2% of the lignite remains as slag and 18% as fly ash, and a new landfill site was planned for both of these in 2019. =Opposition= In January 2019 locals complained that the plant had been restarted causing visible ash pollution in the snow, and local MP Sefer Aycan said in parliament he was concerned that the plant would add to the industrial pollution of the Aksu and Ceyhan rivers. In March 2019 Greenpeace projected the message \\"These chimneys are spitting poison\\" onto the plant, to publicise their earlier report claiming that, together with neighbouring Af≈üin-Elbistan B, the plants were responsible for 17,000 premature deaths. The area is a sulfur dioxide air pollution hotspot. According to energy analyst Haluk Direskeneli, writing in 2019, flue-gas desulfurization is not installed and electrostatic precipitation is inadequate, and \\"it is futile to repair this power plant\\". = Shutdown and reopening = The plant was shut down in January 2020 as it did not meet the flue gas emission limits which came into force that month. √áelikler planned to have filters installed by June 2020. The plant reopened but complaints of air pollution continue and in late 2020 it was said by opposition MP Ali √ñztun√ß to be still operating without filters. Af≈üin-Elbistan B Af≈üin-Elbistan B power station is a 1440MW lignite-fired power station in Af≈üin in Kahramanmara≈ü Province in Turkey state owned by E√úA≈û. The plant burns lignite from the nearby Kƒ±≈ülak√∂y coal mine. Built between 2004 and 2005 Af≈üin-Elbistan B is the largest single installed capacity coal-fired power station in Turkey and is estimated to emit almost 8 Mt CO2 per year, over 1% of Turkey's greenhouse gas emissions. Opponents said in September 2020 that ash retention filters are disabled on the pretext that they are expensive to clean. An environmental impact report for proposed ash and slag storage is being written in 2020. Af≈üin-Elbistan C Af≈üin-Elbistan C is an 1800 MW lignite-fired power station approved to be built for the state-owned generating company. According to the Af≈üin-Elbistan C environmental impact assessment (EIA), it would emit more than 61 million tonnes of CO2 annually.√áƒ±nar (2020), p. 319 For comparison, the total annual greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey are about 500 million tonnes; thus the power station would add over 10% if operated at the targeted capacity factor.Somewhat over a million tonnes of CO2 is emitted for every TWh of electricity generated in Turkey by coal-fired power stations. According to page xix of the February 2020 (final) version of the Af≈üin- Elbistan C environmental impact assessment (EIA) it is aimed to generate just over 12.5 TWh (gross) per year, so why the CO2 emissions are predicted to be so high is unclear. According to the calculation on page 319 of the EIA, 61,636,279.98 tCO2/year would be emitted; this has been rounded above. Public Opinion According to a 2020 survey from nearby Kahramanmara≈ü S√ºt√ß√ºimam University most locals say they have chronic illness, and almost all believe that environmental protection measures taken by power plant managers are insufficient.

Taxonomy Metaxyonycha was first named by Louis Alexandre Auguste Chevrolat in 1836, with the spelling \\"Metazyonycha\\", in Dejean's Catalogue of Coleoptera. According to Bousquet et al. in 2013, Metaxyonycha is an incorrect subsequent spelling of Metazyonycha. However, because the subsequent spelling is in prevailing usage and is attributed to the original spelling's publication, \\"Metaxyonycha\\" is considered the correct spelling. In some publications for the Neotropical realm, Metaxyonycha is also known as \\"Colaspis\\". This was because the Czech entomologist Jan Bechyn√© had synonymised Metaxyonycha with Colaspis, after incorrectly assuming the two had the same type species, while splitting the species of Colaspis in the Junk- Schenkling catalog into a separate genus known as \\"Maecolaspis\\".

Orchids in this genus are epiphytic plants with leafy stems, crowded, leathery leaves arranged in two ranks and a large number of relatively small, short-lived flowers that often open in successive clusters. The sepals and petals are free from and more or less similar to each other, except that the petals are often smaller. The labellum is rigidly fixed to the column and is more or less sac-shaped. There are about 17 species distributed from Assam to the Western Pacific Ocean. Most species grow in rainforests, often on emergent trees such as hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii). Description Orchids in the genus Trachoma are evergreen, epiphytic, monopodial herbs with long branching roots mostly adhering to the trees on which they grow. The stems are relatively short, thick and leafy. The leaves are leathery, crowded and arranged in two ranks with their bases sheathing the stem. A large number of relatively small resupinate flowers are arranged on a short, sometimes club-shaped flowering stem. The flowers are usually short-lived, sometimes only lasting for a few hours. The sepals are free from and more or less similar to each other. The petals are free from each other and usually narrower than the sepals. The labellum is stiffly attached to the column with a short, sac-like spur and three lobes. The side lobes large and erect, the middle lobe often fleshy. Taxonomy and naming The genus Trachoma was first formally described in 1972 by Leslie Andrew Garay in Botanical Museum leaflets, Harvard University. The name Trachoma is an Ancient Greek words meaning \\"roughness\\", referring to \\"the short inflorescence which is quite rough because of the remnants of densely packed bracts.\\" Within the family Orchidaceae, the genus is classified in the subfamily Epidendroideae, tribe Vandeae, and subtribe Aeridinae. It is closely related to Tuberolabium.

With training and a post-graduate qualification in tropical medicine, she responded to an appeal for doctors by the Serbian government in 1915 and treated Serbian casualties, most of whom were victims of typhus. Ross's life and work is commemorated by a plaque in her home town of Tain and her death anniversary is commemorated by ceremonies in Serbia, on 14 February. Early life and family Elizabeth Ross was born in Hampstead, London, to Scottish parents. Her father, Donald Alexander MacBean Ross (18491893), manager of the London branch of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, was originally from Inverness, while her mother, Elizabeth Wilson Ross (n√©e Ness) was from Tain.England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NVGW-LS4: 11 February 2018, Donald Alexander MacBean Ross in entry for Elizabeth Ness Ross) When her father died, they moved to her mother's family in Tain, where she attended Tain Royal Academy. She went on to study medicine at Queen Margaret College, Glasgow, in 1896. This was some two years after Marion Gilchrist, the first woman to qualify in medicine from a university in Scotland, had graduated. Elizabeth Ross graduated with an MB ChB in 1901. Lucy, one of Ross's sisters, also graduated in medicine and became a doctor in York. James Ness MacBean Ross, her brother, became a naval doctor and was awarded the Military Cross and bar and the Croix de Guerre during the First World War.  Early career  Elizabeth Ross in Bakhtiari costume c. 1909 After graduation Ross worked in Tain and then as a medical officer on the Scottish island of Colonsay. She then spent eighteen months in practice in East Ham in London. She accepted a post in Isfahan province as assistant to an Armenian physician in the city of Isfahan before setting up in practice on her own. Returning on leave to the UK she passed the examination to gain the Diploma in Tropical Medicine. On return to Persia she met Samsam al-Saltane (1846‚Äì1930), prime minister of Persia and at his suggestion began to work with Bakhtiari people of south west Persia. Adopting their customs and their dress, she became integrated to such an extent that she was made an honorary chief of the Bakhtiari. She wrote a book describing her experience among them, A Lady Doctor in Bakhtiari Land, which was published posthumously with her brother James as editor. In this she provided \\"first-hand information as to the life, the point of view, and the changing conditions among these virile, if unstable, tribesmen.\\" In 1913 she successfully applied for a job as a ship's surgeon on the SS Nigaristan to work her way home. She subsequently became ship's surgeon on the Glasgow Line SS Glenlogan, a post which took her to India and Japan before she returned to Isfahan in 1914.  Serbia  On the outbreak of the First World War she read of the need for doctors in Serbia. The first phase of the Austro-Hungarian campaign against Serbia had resulted in the Serbian army suffering heavy casualties and a typhus epidemic among the military and the civilian populations. The epidemic reached its height in March 1915 when it was estimated that around 150,000 people were affected, of whom some 30,000 died. Elizabeth Ross arrived in January 1915 and volunteered to work in Kragujevac, the city worst affected by the epidemic, accounting for almost 10 percent of all cases in Serbia. The large military hospital where she worked was overcrowded with typhus victims. The conditions under which Ross worked were described by Louise Fraser, a nurse who visited her from the nearby Scottish Women's Hospital, who wrote that she had seen \\"some of the worst slum dwellings in Britain, but never anything to approach these wards in filth and squalor.\\" At that time the louse-borne transmission of the disease was not fully understood, but the need for cleanliness, disinfection and isolation of victims was. These proved impossible to achieve in the military hospital at that time and the mortality rate from typhus in Kragujevac was particularly high, estimated by Colonel William Hunter of the British Military Sanitary Mission to Serbia at 40‚Äì50%. Death and legacy Serbian postage stamp of 2015 depicting Elizabeth Ross Ross died from typhus on her 37th birthday, 14 February 1915, three weeks after arriving in Kragujevac. She is buried in the cemetery in Kragujevac, the inscription on her gravestone including, in Serbian, the text: \\"In memory of Dr. E. Ross and two nurses who died in 1915 in our town while attending to our ill and wounded soldiers. Grateful soldiers from the Saloniki front. Renewed 1977.\\" There is a plaque in her memory in St Duthac's Church, Tain. which includes the words \\"This tablet has been erected and hospital beds endowed in Serbia by public subscription in remembrance of the noble life and sacrifice of one whose home was for many years in Tain.\\" In 2015 Ross was one of six British women to feature on a commemorative set of postage stamps issued by Serbia Post. The local Red Cross youth branch in Kragujevac is named the Dr Elizabeth Ross Society. At the annual commemoration ceremony they wear t-shirts bearing Ross's graduation photograph. Elizabeth Ross Street in Kragujevac is named after her. On 14 February, her birth and death date, memorial ceremonies are held each year in Kragujevac and at other locations in Serbia to commemorate her work for the people of Serbia.

He has superhuman strength and endurance and is able to generate extremely high temperatures which can produce bursts of flame or be used as a flaming sword. A fight with Batman leaves Lucien in a coma for 28 years. When Lucien awakens in 1983, his body has atrophied. Lucien, who craves vengeance, learns that Batman is believed to be dead. Lucien uses his mind to possess his Earth- One counterpart, who is a well-respected member of his community, and makes him to adopt the Brimstone identity in an attempt to kill the Earth-One Batman. After this fails, the mind of the Earth-Two Lucien is forced back into its own body. As a side-effect of his mental projection across the dimensional barrier, Lucien is completely paralyzed. =The New 52= A version of Brimstone exists in The New 52 universe, mentioned as being an enemy of Goldrush. He was defeated by Goldrush when he attempted to incinerate Dallas, Goldrush's base of operations. =Joseph Chamberlain= Joseph Chamberlian first appeared in The Curse of Brimstone #1 (June 2018) and was created by Justin Jordan and Philip Tan. Chamberlain was born in a dying coal town and made a deal with the devil to become Brimstone. He has a demonic transformation that gives him the power to project and manipulate Hellfire, among other superhuman qualities. Joseph Chamberlain was born to a coal miner named Darren Chamberlain and had a sister named Annie. He lived in York Hills, a small but semi-prosperous town in the middle of nowhere. Joe's father was injured in a tunnel collapse, permanently damaging his leg. Eventually, the coal mines of York Hills dried up and the town soon lost its economic use. Many people left the town for new experiences and the schools shut down, however Joe could not move due to his father's disability and his lack of job experience. If someone wanted a job they needed to leave town, which required a car, which required a job to obtain. Fortunately, Joe was able to buy a car. This car soon broke down and he was picked up by a good Samaritan. The Samaritan introduced himself as \\"the Salesman\\" and told Joe that he had been sent to York Hills by a group known as the Home Office. The Salesman told Joe that he could put York Hills on the map and that he wanted Joe to be one of his agents in charge of renovating the dead town. Joe eagerly agreed and he shook the Salesman's hand in agreement. When he touched the Salesman's hand, Joe quickly began undergoing a dramatic transformation into a creature of Hellfire known as Brimstone. The Salesman then revealed that he was a powerful entropic entity who planned to put York Hills on the map by killing all of its inhabitants, an act that Brimstone would carry out. A short time later, Joe woke up in his bed to find Annie watching over him. Annie explained that she had found Joe naked on the mountain side and had brought him home. All of a sudden, the houses in the town had lit on fire, but were soon put out by an ongoing blizzard. After telling Annie what had happened on the mountain side, the pair decided to investigate whether the Salesman had ever appeared before. Eventually they found a subreddit listing small towns like York Hills that were destroyed in \\"freak weather accidents\\", which the pair believed that the Salesman's agents were responsible for. Joe and Annie travelled to the only hotel in town where the Salesman would be staying. They found his room empty, except for clothes and a ledger. The Salesman's ledger contained his previous transactions, confirming that his agents had destroyed all the towns. Abruptly, all of the phones in the building began to ring. Annie picked up one of the phones and was greeted by the voice of the Salesman. The Salesman told the pair that he had kidnapped their father. Joe and Annie were then met by the arrival of the woman responsible for the blizzard. This woman was another of the Salesman's agents known as the Hound, whose domain was ice rather than fire. She, too, had been tricked into a bargain with the Salesman and destroyed her town; however, she had accepted her role afterwards. Joe activated his Brimstone transformation and began attacking the Hound. He was quickly overwhelmed by the Hound; however, he was able to escape when Annie slammed a truck into the Hound. Annie and Joe soon found themselves being chased by the Hound. Eventually, they pulled up to make a stand, but discovered the Salesman waiting for them. The Salesman was accompanied by Joe's father, who was still being held hostage. The Salesman ordered Joe to fulfill the task that he had been assigned, so that the world would be more hospitable for the Home Office when they arrived. Enraged at the Salesman, Joe tackled him to the floor and tried to destroy him. However, he was stopped by the Hound, who quickly began to overwhelm him. Just as Brimstone was about to be executed, Joe's father tackled the Hound. The Hound froze Joe's father to death, causing Joe's anger to overcharge. Joe's emotional spike caused him to explode in a burst of Hellfire, turning the entire town to ash. In the aftermath only Joe and Annie survived, the Hound was dead and the Salesman was gone. Annie and Joe decided that they must stop a tragedy like this from ever happening again and so went on a road trip with the Salesman's ledger, which contained the locations of his next targets.

The first season debuted on 30 November 2018. The series follows students at an elite high school in Rome who engage in prostitution. It is loosely based on the story of two high school girls in Rome involved in an underage prostitution ring (the \\"Baby Squillo\\" scandal) in 2014. In December 2018, Netflix announced a second season of the series, which premiered on 18 October 2019. The series was renewed for a third and final season, which was released on 16 September 2020. Inspired by the scandal of Baby Squillo of 2013, the plot develops in an elite high school in Rome. Baby follows Chiara (Benedetta Porcaroli), a young, rich girl who is disenchanted with her privileged and too normal life. All of that changes when Chiara meets Ludovica (Alice Pagani), an impulsive troublemaker who's secretly in need of money. Partially due to desperation, partially due to boredom, Ludovica draws Chiara into the world of underage prostitution, and it's as bad of an idea as it sounds. Ludovica becomes involved with Fiore, a young man who is a part of the prostitution and cares very deeply for her, to the point where he becomes obsessed with her.

He is a Senior Scientist and Scientific Deputy Director of the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, Austria. Early life and education Meinrad Busslinger grew up in the Swiss town of Zug, near Zurich, where he obtained his grammar school education. From 1972 to 1976, he studied natural sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, where he majored in biochemistry. During his PhD studies (1976-1981), Busslinger discovered important regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional control of gene expression by investigating the regulation of sea urchin histone genes. He performed his PhD work under the supervision of Max L. Birnstiel at the University of Zurich, from where he received a PhD degree in molecular biology in 1981. Career and research In 1981, Busslinger joined the lab of Richard A. Flavell at the MRC Institute Mill Hill in London as a postdoctoral fellow. There, he discovered that a single nucleotide mutation in the first intron of the Œ≤-globin gene causes Œ≤+-thalassemia and that DNA methylation of promoter sequences prevents gene transcription. In 1983, Busslinger became a Group Leader at the Institute of Molecular Biology II of the University of Zurich. Here, he discovered a new set of histone genes of the sea urchin and identified a tissue-specific transcription factor (TSAP) as an essential regulator of these genes, which later turned out to be a member of the Paired box (Pax)-containing transcription factor family. In 1987, Max Birnstiel recruited Busslinger to join the newly founded Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, Austria, as one of the first Senior Scientists. In 1996, Busslinger was appointed Professor at the University of Vienna. In 2007, he became the IMP's Director of Academic Affairs and, in 2013, Scientific Deputy Director. At the IMP, Busslinger changed his research focus from sea urchin embryogenesis to B cell immunology, which was promoted by the identification of a B-cell-specific transcription factor as a mammalian homologue of the sea urchin regulator TSAP. Protein purification and sequencing identified the B-cell-specific transcription factor as Pax5, and gene inactivation in the mouse defined Pax5 an essential regulator of B cell development. In 1999, Busslinger and his lab described the first molecular definition of a lineage commitment process by identifying Pax5 as the B cell lineage commitment factor that restricts the developmental options of early lymphoid progenitors to the B cell pathway by repressing lineage-inappropriate genes and that simultaneously promotes B cell development by activating B-cell-specific genes. To date, Pax5 is known to function as a guardian of B cell identity for early to late B cell development and to function as an important tumor suppressor or oncoprotein in B cell leukemia. In addition to Pax5, the Busslinger group investigated the role of other important transcription factors, such as E2A, EBF1, Ikaros, and Blimp1, in regulating distinct aspects of B cell development and immunity. Busslinger also contributed to the current knowledge of how the large locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) protein undergoes spatial contraction by looping in early B cell development. This long-range looping induces the juxtaposition of Variable (V) gene segments next to Diversity (D) gene segments, which facilitates V-to-DJ recombination to generate a functional IgH gene. Busslinger identified Pax5 as a critical regulator of IgH locus contraction that facilitates chromatin loop extrusion across the entire locus. He is a member of the Editorial Board for Immunity.

She is remembered as an effective member of Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de, the Danish branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), later known as Kvindernes Internationale Liga for Fred og Frihed (KILFF). From 1931 to 1939, she was the organization's vice-president. She was an active participant at the international WILPF conferences from 1926 to 1937 as well as a member of their international committee where she dealt with the rights of minorities. Early life and education Born on 2 October 1865 in Brahesborg, a manor house near Assens on the island of Funen, Benny Sophie Caroline Andrea Treschow was the daughter of the estate owner Carl Adolph Rothe Treschow (1839‚Äì1924) and Sophie Margrethe Elisabeth Rantzau (1844‚Äì1911). She was brought up in a prominent noble household, receiving her education at home from private tutors brought in from abroad. As a result, she was able to converse fluently in French, English and German. In 1892, she married Hans Christian Frederik Wilhelm Cederfeld de Simonsen (1866‚Äì1938), also an affluent estate owner on Funen. Thereafter she moved into his Erholm manor. Role as a peace activist Struck by the hostilities of the First World War, in 1916 Cederfeld de Simonsen joined the peace organization Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de, becoming the head of its Funen chapter in 1919. In 1925, participating in the annual meeting of the Dansk Fredsforening (DF) or Danish Peace Society, she stood up against the society's criticism of the KILFF. DF, founded in 1882 by Fredrik Bajer, considered the KILFF a rival, believing that all Danish peace organizations should come under its control. Together with Clara Tybjerg and Henriette Beenfeldt, Cederfeld de Simonsen maintained that it could only help if there were two organizations in Denmark striving for peace as they could extend there interests more widely. Cederfeld de Simonsen was particularly effective in increasing membership of the Funen chapter of the KILFF, making it by far the largest local organization with 4,000 members. Before the German occupation of Denmark, in March 1940 she was particularly effective in liaising between the Danske Kvinders Nationalr√•d (Women's Council of Denmark) and the Danish Jewish women's society J√∏disk Kvindeforening. Her efforts resulted in 320 Jewish children from central Europe being brought to Denmark to be cared for in Danish homes. Maintaining her interest in the peace movement for the rest of her life, Benny Cederfeld de Simonsen died in Copenhagen on 16 January 1952.

Originally founded in 1849, the church was built in its current location on the western bank of the Chao Phraya River in 1857. The present building dates to 1910. History The first American Presbyterian missionaries, William P. Buell and his wife, arrived in Bangkok in 1840, but left in 1844 after Mrs Buell became paralysed from illness. The next group of missionaries, Stephen Mattoon and his wife and Samuel Reynolds House, arrived in 1847. They settled near the area of Kudi Chin, where earlier Protestant missionaries, including Dan Beach Bradley, were already living. They were joined in 1849 by Stephen Bush and his wife. The same year, the missionaries met to establish a congregation, naming it the First Presbyterian Church, Bangkok. Without a dedicated church building, they continued to worship in their homes. In 1852, they built a school, which is considered the first formal school in the country and is now Bangkok Christian College. In 1857, the missionaries relocated to a plot of land in the Samre (or Samray, ) area further down the river (now Samre Subdistrict of Thonburi District). Mattoon had previously acquired the land, then a faraway wilderness, on behalf of David O. King, an American merchant based in Shanghai. King's business subsequently went bankrupt, leaving Mattoon with the land. A church building was built from 1860 to 1862, with donations from foreign merchants, sailors and missionaries, as well as funds from the American government (construction was delayed by the American Civil War). The original church building was consecrated on 25 May 1862. By the turn of the century, the congregation had outgrown the building, and the church was rebuilt to the original style in 1910. The bell tower was built in 1912. The church has since been in continued use, with periodical restorations. Architecture The church is a single-storey structure, built of masonry with load-bearing walls. It has a rectangular floor plan, three column-spans wide and six spans long. The fa√ßade, which faces the river to the east, features flower-patterned stucco work on the gable, which is above a portico recessed behind three arches. The simple gable roof is supported by a wooden structure. The building received the ASA Architectural Conservation Award in 2004.

It was built as part of the route from to Glarus, which was opened by the United Swiss Railways (Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen, VSB) on 15 February 1859.  History The line was built as an extension of the Wallisellen‚ÄìUster‚ÄìRapperswil railway (Glatthalbahn), which had been extended from Wetzikon to R√ºti on 15 August 1858 after its acquisition by the VSB. The line was opened at the same time as the Murg‚ÄìSargans line. The intervening section between Weesen and Murg was not completed until 1 July 1859. The line shortened the distance between Zurich and Chur. Its importance as a long- distance line was reduced by the opening on 20 September 1875 by the Swiss Northeast Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn) of the Lake Z√ºrich left-bank railway, which runs from Z√ºrich to N√§fels via and Ziegelbr√ºcke. As a result, the Rapperswil‚ÄìZiegelbr√ºcke line was never duplicated. It experienced increased use Between Rapperswil and Uznach with the opening of the Uznach‚ÄìWattwil railway on 1 October 1910. The route between Rapperswil and was electrified in connection with a train accident in the Ricken tunnel on the Uznach‚ÄìWattwil railway on 4 October 1926 that led to the death nine people as a result of suffocation from carbon monoxide poisoning. Electrification of the line was completed on 7 May 1927 at 15 kV AC 162/3 Hz. Electrification of the line between Uznach and Ziegelbr√ºcke (continuing to Linthal) followed on 15 May 1933.  Route  The line follows the right bank of the Obersee at the upper end of Lake Zurich from Rapperswil to near . It continues to the east and turns to the southwest after Uznach station towards and runs east around the Benken hillock and then to the south-southwest in a straight line via the Gastermatt to and on to Ziegelbr√ºcke. The line has no major engineering structures. Bollingen station between Wurmsbach Abbey and the village of Bollingen, near Stafel, was closed and replaced as stop for scheduled trains at the 2004 timetable change by the halt of , which had been refurbished in the 1980s.  Operations The whole line is served every hour by services on line S6 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn on the Rapperswil‚ÄìZiegelbr√ºcke‚Äì route; these services continued to until December 2013. In Uznach, there is a connection to line S4 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn towards Wattwil and . The Rapperswil‚ÄìUznach section is used by the hourly Voralpen-Express services. These stop in Rapperswil, Schmerikon and Uznach. Freight trains have not generally used the line since 2006, when Uznach was closed for freight traffic. However, the line is regularly used for nocturnal diversions for work on the Pf√§ffikon‚Äì‚ÄìZiegelbr√ºcke line.  Rolling stock The regional service between Rapperswil and Linthal was operated for decades after the electrification with fir green trains, which were hauled by Ae 3/6 I and Ae 4/7 locomotives. These were replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Neuer Pendelzug (new push- pull trains, NPZ) RBDe 4/4 sets, which are nicknamed \\"Hummingbirds\\" because of their colourful paintwork.

Medgyaszay [Benk√≥], Istv√°n. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. 2003. Initially they based their propositions on three primary themes: the problem of personal identity, the limits of the individual, and share space in the tu- yo dialectic and that of the natural elements.Palenzuela, J. (2000). Ideas sobre lo visible. Caracas: Banco Central de Venezuela. The body and the approach to nature were central themes of their research and reflections in the search for vital keys of creation and life. They framed the self-designed and interiorist affiliation with the ecological calls of the 20th century avant-garde and with primitive symbolism of the natural world, producing moving conceptual and aesthetic proposals of both humanity and nature, \\"the body of one as the body of the world\\" (good/bad of the planet as good/bad of the being).

Reflection on the female body and nature, video and photography, Land Art and performance are some of the concepts and materials that come together in their work. Their performances handled concepts such as freedom, nature and the female body, with the aim of \\"showing another look on the woman's body, of a poetic, philosophical and symbolic form, but also political\\".  Education  Yeni-Jennifer Hacksaw studied at the Cristobal Rojas School (1975-1977), the Central School of Art and the Chelsea School of Art in London (1977-1978), the School of Image in Cannes, France (1978-1980) and the Workshop of Experimental Cinema with the filmmaker Alfredo Anzola (Caracas, 1980) from 1979-1986.

Works  = Developed Bodily Actions of the Cycle of Life = Yen and Nan are best known for Developed Bodily Actions on the Cycles of Life, such as birth and transfiguration, and also on the elements of nature: water, earth and air. They created events that involved the natural landscape of Venezuela, as in \\"Salinas de Araya,\\" one of their most emblematic works that also inspired the feature film by Margot Benecerraf. In the seventies and eighties, the duo collaborated with other creators of performances who worked on the rituals of Venezuelan national being, communication, passion and violence.Flores, E. (1983). Convergencias. Caracas, Venezuela: Monte Avila Editores. Yeni and Nan, along with Antoinette Sosa, were the only women of those creators who were recognized at the time. They paid more attention to the inner life and the psycho-physical transformations of their anatomies, acting with self-centered and meditative intensity to slowly recreate the internal and external rhythms in their bodies. They were influenced by martial arts, psychology, theater, dance and cinema. In the early 1980s, their work \\"Integraciones en Agua\\" (Integrations in Water, 1980) and \\"Transfiguraci√≥n Elemento Tierra\\" (Earth Element Transfiguration, 1983) challenged the conventions and traditional forms of art, using their own bodies and senses in action as avenues of aesthetic representation in the search for direct, sensory and participatory art.3.http://www.henriquefaria.com/artist-works?id=101 Yeni and Nan present collections related to the innermost being, approaching the body. According to Mar√≠a Elena Ramos, curator of some of their exhibitions, the works \\"support at the same time ecological, plastic and poetic.\\"Palenzuela, J. (2002). 11 tipos. Caracas: Academia Nacional de la Historia. In 1980, with the body as a central element, Yeni and Nan presented Presences and Art Artist (GAN), a metallic skeleton of a cube. They sought to employ the language of gesture and movement to express the unification of the internal space that has to break down to achieve the liberating experience of outer space. In 1981, with Integraciones en Agua, they participated in the XVI Bienal de S√£o Paulo. The performance allowed them to assemble a visual, sound and tactile language. In the same year, in the Colloquium of Non-objectual Art organized in the Museum of Modern Art (Medell√≠n, Colombia), they presented their Acci√≥n Divisoria del Espacio (Dividing Action of Space). In 1982 they performed Integraciones en Agua in the areas of the GAN and represented Venezuela in the Biennial of Young Artists of Paris (Museum of Modern Art of the City of Paris) with contemplative Integrations and Water Integrations II. In 1983, in the Alternate Space of the GAN, they installed their video-performance, Transfiguraci√≥n Elemento Tierra in the framework of the collective exhibition \\"Autorretrato ‚Äì The artist as object-subject of art\\". In 1985, in the III National Salon of Young Artists of the MACC (an edition dedicated to installations), they participated with Man and Salt, for which they won first prize. The same installation (expanded) was represented at the La Rinconada Art Museum, Caracas, under the title Symbolism of Crystallization: Man-Salt II the last presentation made by Yeni and Nan in the framework of the exhibition, \\"Nature in Three Times\\". In April 2010, at Far√≠a + F√°bregas Galer√≠a, they presented a conceptualist sample consisting of a group of photographs, polaroids and videos that record the central performances and actions developed by the artists, titled Water, Salt, Land (Bodily Actions 1978/1986). The exhibition presents a selection of images of some of the artists' bodily events. Through the metaphor, their gestures of immersion in the water give an image and memory of the natural cycles of origin, and their slow movements refer both to the extent of the seas in which life arose and to the concentration in the containers of plastic that narrow their movement before reaching their exit to light. The damp layer of earth that surrounds their faces, and which dries out shows human fragility and at the same time that of the planet, its dangers of drought, infertility and extinction. Several of the pieces that make up the exhibits were recorded in U-matic format and edited by the artists with two Betamax and a homemade Moviola. The collaboration of gallery owner, Henrique Faria, who had ordered the work, and the recovery of images from journalist Margarita D'Amico, is structured in five sections that show 56 works, mostly photography and video. The first one, called \\"Birth,\\" presents its beginnings, with images of its stage of European formation; followed by \\"Identity\\" that shows the interest of these artists, according to Murr√≠a, more than in the finished work, in \\"the process and experimentation, the artistic experience for them and for the public\\". \\"Land\\" and \\"Water\\" present the interest of both for the essential and the natural. The tour ended in Araya, a name that refers to Venezuelan salt mines, where they were videotaped and photographed. They donated a collection of 66 images of this performance to the CAAC. \\"It's wonderful to get together again,\\" said Nan, on her arrival from Venezuela, in reference to the fact that more than thirty years before these artists took different paths ‚Äî Yeni had moved to Salamanca. The reunion also served to close a circle, since at the inauguration they presented a new performance, Fire, an element of strength, purity and transformation. Camnitzer, L. (2007).

Early Life and Religious Loyalties Hutchison was born on 3 January 1741 into a farming family at Dunblane where his father was an elder of the Anti- burgher Church of the First Secession.Dunblane parish register (baptismal entry of 8 January 1841); Rev Gavin Struthers, DD, The History of the Rise, Progress and Principles of the Relief Church embracing notices of the Other Religious Denominations in Scotland (A. Fullarton & Co., 1843), p. 256. Raised in that communion, he initially accepted its teaching without hesitation but, in circumstances that are unclear, came to question its principles.Gavin Struthers, ut supra, at pp. 256-7, states that Hutchison was educated for the Anti-burgher ministry and was on the point of applying for his licence when persuaded otherwise by sermons of Rev. Alexander Pirie, preached in the parish of Blairlogie which Hutchison visited from neighbouring Dunblane. The first limb of this is challenged by Rev. Robert Small, DD, in History of the Congregations of the United Presbyterian Church from 1733 to 1900 (David M. Small, Edinburgh, 1904), Vol. II at p. 700, and since Pirie did not arrive at Blairlogie until after Hutchinson was licensed by the Relief, the account seems otherwise unreliable. Neither Struthers nor Small refers to Hutchison‚Äôs university education, though he was styled Master of Arts (‚ÄúAM‚Äù) in his publications. Concluding that some of these had no basis in Scripture, and dismayed by what he saw as the Anti-burghers‚Äô preference for narrow dogma over moral conscience, he joined the Relief Church. By 1770 he had been licensed by the Relief Presbytery and appointed assistant to Dr James Baine, minister at College Street, Edinburgh, one of the fathers of the Relief. As a ruling elder of College Street he attended the first Relief Synod in May 1773.Gavin Struthers, ut supra, p. 257; John Struthers, The History of Scotland from the Union to the abolition of the Heritable Jurisdictions in 1748 (Blackie Fullarton, Glasgow, 1827), Vol. II, p. 598; and see Paisley and Renfrewshire Gazette of 3 July 1880 for reference to the duration of Hutchison‚Äôs term as assistant to Baine. His Ministry In November 1774 he was inducted as first Relief minister at St. Ninians, near Stirling.Small, ut supra; A Short History of St. Ninians United Free Church, Stirling, Chapter 2 (http://ufcos.org.uk/stirling/history.htm) There he was on terms of close friendship with Rev. Alexander Pirie,For details of Pirie, see his entry in the Dictionary of National Biography. in whose church at Blairlogie he frequently preached and in debate with whom he refined his judgement on topics of ministerial concern.Gavin Struthers, ut supra, p. 242. During his eight years at St. Ninians he became one of Scotland‚Äôs foremost religious controversialists, publishing for the first time tracts systematically setting out what were the doctrinal beliefs of the Relief communion and why they were scripturally correct when different from those of other Presbyterian denominations.Ibid., pp. 258-9; Very Rev. Robert Drummond, DD, Traditions and Reminiscences of the Relief Church (Scottish Church History Society, 1944), p. 47. He largely withdrew from the printed fray in May 1783 upon removing to become minister at Paisley,Small, ut supra. a rapidly expanding town that required greater pastoral attention. But he still courted controversy with outspoken calls for political reform and for an end to the war with France, resulting in a rift within his congregation in 1796.Gavin Struthers, ut supra, p. 382. His preaching style was variously described as ‚Äúwarm and energetic‚Äù and ‚Äúmasculine, eloquent and impressive‚Äù,Preface to Sermons on Various and Important Subjects by Rev. Patrick Hutchison, AM, late Minister of the Gospel in Paisley (J. Pillans & Sons, Edinburgh, 1803); Struthers, ut supra, p. 417. and he accepted invitations to preach across the west of Scotland such that his very name became ‚Äúa tower of strength for his denomination‚Äù. He continued at Paisley until his death, by which time his large church there was regularly ‚Äúfull to overflowing‚Äù.Glasgow Herald, 14 February 1863; Small, ut supra, p. 519. His Writings By 1779 the Relief was under attack from both Burghers and Anti-burghers, and Hutchison took it upon himself to hold the Relief‚Äôs corner in print, publishing A Compendious View of the Religious System maintained by the Synod of Relief.A Compendious View of the Religious System maintained by the Synod of Relief together with a distinct Account of the Points in difference between the Synod of Relief and the National Establishment on the one hand and the Secession on the other (Daniel Reid, Falkirk, 1779). This put at the heart of the system principles of independence of church from patronage and civil authority, toleration and friendly communion between all Protestant persuasions, and rejection of conventions (in particular, submission to the Solemn League of Covenant) that would, as Hutchison saw it, exclude Christ‚Äôs apostles from membership of the church of the First Secession. The Burgher Synod replied with a pamphlet denouncing the Relief as unprincipled in its fellowship and conducive to immorality, to which Hutchison responded with A Few Animadversions on the Re-exhibition of Burgher- Testimony,A Few Animadversions on the Re-Exhibition of the Burgher Testimony as far as it relates to the Principles of the Relief Church (David Paterson, Edinburgh, 1779). and in 1780 he published A Dissertation on the Nature and Genius of the Kingdom of Christ,A Dissertation on the nature and genius of the Kingdom of Christ. In two parts. Containing a delineation of the nature of Messiah‚Äôs Kingdom, and its distinctiveness for the kingdom of this world (David Paterson, Edinburgh, 1780). asserting that the form of the church should be consistent with its first foundation as described in the New Testament. Ministers of other persuasions circulated papers containing further charges against the Relief, to which Hutchison issued a refutation in 1781.Animadversions on Two Pamphlets published by the Rev Messrs Ramsay and Walker (David Paterson, Edinburgh, 1781). He wrote in vehement terms (referring to ‚Äúdetestable lies‚Äù by ‚Äúviperous bigots‚Äù). This probably increased the appeal and circulation of his tracts, and they ran to several editions.Gavin Struthers, ut supra, pp. 258-260 (‚Äúif he had possessed less feeling he would have used more measured language but his pamphlets would have slumbered on shelves instead of being read from house to house‚Äù). In 1788 he produced Three Discourses on the Divine and Mediatorial Character of Jesus ChristPrinted by John Neilson, Paisley, 1788., described by Dr Struthers, the historian of the Relief Church, as ‚Äútruly masterly discourses, determined by that breadth of intellect, and that fervour of mind, which so remarkably distinguished their author‚Äù.Gavin Struthers, ut supra, pp. 364-5. In 1803, following his death, a volume containing sixteen of his sermons was printedSermons on Various and Important Subjects, ut supra. and this continued to be reissued into the 1840s. The Relief Hymnbook Hutchison believed that the singing of hymns, and not simply Psalms (as was then the general practice), should be a vital part of worship, and in 1793 he printed for use by his congregation Sacred Songs and Hymns on Various Passages of Scripture. To be sung in the Worship of God.Printed by J. Neilson, Paisley, 1793. This adopted the selection of one hundred and eighty psalms and hymns previously printed by Rev. James Stewart for his Anderston, Glasgow, congregation but added a further fifty-one hymns (including twenty by Isaac Watts and five by Charles Wesley) chosen by Hutchison. In this he seems to have acted in conjunction with his brother-in-law, Rev. James Dun, who had the same compilation printed for the Relief congregation at Campbell Street, Glasgow: both editions carried a Preface by Hutchison justifying the use of hymns in public worship. In 1794 the compilation was adopted by the Relief Synod as the church‚Äôs first hymn-book and it continued unrevised until 1825.Gavin Struthers, ut supra, pp. 374-6. His Legacy In 1843 Struthers opined that ‚ÄúTo Mr Hutchison, more than to any other author of the last century, the religious public of Scotland is indebted for correct and scriptural views of the constitution of the church of Christ‚Äù.Ibid., p. 417. By that year initiatives were already afoot that, in 1847, saw the (now combined) Burgher and Anti-burgher denominations merge with the Relief to form the United Presbyterian Church, a communion that was liberal in instinct, evangelical in practice, concerned to redefine its relationship with civil institutions, and committed to congregational singing. Its principles closely resembled those adumbrated by Hutchison, and when the history of the United Presbyterian Church came to be written in 1904 (shortly after its unification with the Free Church), the author credited him with having ‚Äúreasoned out principles of permanent value in the ecclesiastical world‚Äù.Small, ut supra. His Death and Family Hutchison died at Paisley on 10 January 1802, ‚Äúregretted by his own congregation and by many Christians of different denominations‚Äù.Gavin Struthers, ut supra, p. 417; Preface to Sermons on Various and Important Subjects, ut supra, quoting from obituary tribute in Glasgow Courier and Advertiser published immediately after Hutchison‚Äôs death. He had married, in 1779, Helen Graham of Tamrawer, who died in 1809.Stirling parish register (entry of marriage 17 October 1779); The Grahams of Tamrawer, A Short Account of their History, compiled by J. Edward Graham (Edinburgh Press, 1895), p. 29 ; Kentish Weekly Post, 19 September 1809. They had seven sons, of whom three conducted the muslin manufacturing business of James Hutchison & Co., once among the largest textile concerns in Glasgow.Evidence of James Hutchison contained in Report on the State of the Irish Poor in Great Britain (Parliamentary Papers 1836, XXXIV, G, 107 and 111). Of these three, James (1780-1862) was Glasgow‚Äôs Dean of Guild in 1833, Robert (1782-1862) amassed perhaps the city‚Äôs finest private art collection, and Graham (1795-1858) acquired the Craigton House estate; all were Glasgow City Councillors in 1843.Merchants House of Glasgow, List of Deans from 1605; Glasgow Herald, 14 May 1856 and 10 January 1863; The Glasgow Story, Craigton House; Report of the Poor Law Inquiry Commission for Scotland, 1843, p. 417.

From 1882, perhaps recommended by Louis Charles Auguste Steinheil, he worked for F√©lix Gaudin, for whom he made drawings for stained glass windows.Jean-Fran√ßois Luneau, F√©lix Gaudin, peintre-verrier et mosa√Øste, 1851‚Äì1930 (Presses Universitaires Blaise Pascal, Clermont Ferrand 2006, ), p. 406 In 1883, Guth moved to London.Jean Paul Perrin, Guth, Jean Baptiste at lillustration.com, accessed 10 January 2019 Guth's alma mater, the √âcole des Beaux-Arts From 1884 to 1920, Guth's work was published in the French magazine L'Illustration and from 1889 to 1909 in the British Vanity Fair, signing himself \\"GUTH\\". Among his many portraits for Vanity Fair were his images of Queen Victoria,Roy T.

Guth revealed few details of his own life. A book about G√©r√¥me notes the existence of a portrait of him by Guth, in which G√©r√¥me is shown wearing a sculptor's smock, working on a bust. The artist is described as \\"Jean-Baptiste Guth, peintre et √©l√®ve de G√©r√¥me, sur lequel on ne sait pas grand chose...\\" (painter and pupil of G√©r√¥me, about whom not much is known).Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, 1824-1904: peintre, sculpteur et graveur : ses ≈ìuvres conserv√©es dans les collections fran√ßaises publiques et priv√©es (Mus√©e de Vesoul, 1981), p. 174 Exhibitions In the final year of the First World War, the Goupil Gallery in London presented an exhibition of Guth's portraits of British and French generals, admirals, and statesmen,Le Mus√©e et l'encyclop√©die de la guerre, Volume 3 (J. Grand-Carteret, 1918), p. 69: \\"Un artiste parisien, Jean-Baptiste Guth, √©l√®ve de G√©rome, et peintre d√©corateur, a expos√© √† la Goupil-Gallery, les portraits des hommes d'Etat, des g√©n√©raux, des amiraux fran√ßais et anglais qui dirigent et conduisent la guerre.\\" under the title \\"Men who are running the War, and other celebrities of the Entente\\".The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Volume 32 (London: Savile Publishing Company, 1918), p. 84 The Graphic said in its review \\"No finer series of war portraits has been seen in London than those of M. Jean Baptiste Guth, now on exhibition at the Goupil Gallery in Regent Street... They are drawn in chalk, and have all been taken from life. They are bold in conception, annexing inevitably the dominant characteristic of the subject. One of the best is that of Viscount Grey.

Most of the buildings along the street are listed, meaning they are of national importance due to their architecture or history. History The street roughly follows the line of the via praetoria of Eboracum, the Roman city, which ran between what are now St Helen's Square and York Minster. The street appears to have lost importance in the Anglian and Jorvik period. York Minster was rebuilt in the 11th century, and stone for it was brought up the road, from a quay behind what is now York Guildhall. This appears to have brought the street back to prominence, and new building plots were laid adjoining the north-eastern part of the street. This part of the street lay in the Liberty of St Peter's, associated with the Minster, and many of its buildings belonged to the church, the whole area soon becoming built up, mostly with tenements. By 1215, there were houses for the prebends of Ampleforth, Barnby, Bramham and North Newbald. Looking north-east on Stonegate The street was known as \\"Stonegate\\" by 1119, probably named for stone paving, which would have been unique in the city at the time, although an alternative theory links the name to the stone hauled up to the Minster. Glass painters and goldsmiths became prominent along the road, while from the 1500s, it became known for printers and bookshops. In 1762, John Todd set up a well-known library and bookshop on the street. Because of the location of the street, it has historically been used for civic processions, from the York Guildhall to the Minster. It was also the site where three of the historic York Mystery Plays were performed. In 1570, Guy Fawkes was born at a house on the street. Nikolaus Pevsner described the street as \\"perhaps the most attractive [street in the city], and one of the busiest. Narrow, quite long, and with a variety of good things\\". Due to its popularity with tourists, the street was pedestrianised in 1974. It was repaved in York stone in 2020. Architecture and layout Aerial view of Stonegate, looking south-west, in 1991 The street runs north-east from St Helen's Square to the junction of High and Low Petergate, beyond which its continuation is Minster Gates. Before 1745, it started slightly further south-west, at a junction with Coney Street and Davygate, so St Helen's, Stonegate was actually accessed from the street. Various yards lead off its north-western side, while Little Stonegate and the snickleway Coffee Yard lead off its south-eastern side. Most of the buildings along the street are listed. Among the most notable on the north-west side are numbers 54 to 58, 14th-century timber-framed buildings; the 12th-century Norman House, in a courtyard off the road; 48 to 52, and 44 to 46, each with 15th-century origins; Ye Olde Starre Inn, in a courtyard, the oldest continuously operating pub in the city, with a sign which has spanned the road since 1733; and numbers 12 to 14, in part dating from the 14th-century. On the south-east side lie The Punch Bowl, a pub which opened as a coffee house in 1675 and was rebuilt in 1931; and the 15th-century buildings of 13 Stonegate, Mulberry Hall, 21 and 25, and 35 Stonegate. There are also the headquarters of the York Medical Society, accessed by an alleyway; and 37 Stonegate with an early-19th century shopfront.

Design The craft contained a cigar-shaped fuselage with low-mounted wings. Unusually, it contained two engines mounted in the junction of the wing and the fuselage, as opposed to on the wings, to allow it to continue running if one engine failed. This also would allow a sleeker and more aerodynamic design. Two annular radiators were present on front of the propellers. It had two landing wheels, both of which could retract. It was crewed by four people. It is likely that the complicated design of the engine was what caused the abandonment of the project.
