Nowadays the name Triveneto is more commonly used in the Northern Italian dialects, while its original title is still in use in the Neapolitan Language and Southern Italian dialects, and it includes the three Italian regions of Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol: that is to say, the provinces of Belluno, Bolzano, Gorizia, Padua, Pordenone, Rovigo, Trento, Treviso, Trieste, Udine, Venice, Verona, and Vicenza. This area is also the Catholic Ecclesiastical Region of Triveneto.Regione ecclesiastica Triveneto  History  The entire area was under Austrian rule in 1863; Italy annexed Venezia Euganea in 1866,Peace of Prague (1866) following the Third Italian War of Independence and a controversial plebiscite (see Venetian nationalism); Venezia Giulia and Venezia Tridentina passed under the Italian rule in 1919, following the end of World War I.Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) After World War II, Italy retained the most part of Tre Venezie, but lost the upper Isonzo valley (together with the eastern part of Gorizia, today called Nova Gorica), the city of Fiume, most part of Carso region and most part of Istria to Yugoslavia.Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947 The areas of Trieste (Zone A) and north-west Istria (Zone B) were formed in the Free Territory of Trieste: in 1954, Italy reannexed Zone A, while Zone B was ceded to Yugoslavia.  Heritage and culture  This territory in known for the legacy of the Austrian culture and administration, as well for its close ties with the German and Slavic worlds. Its cultural history dates back to the people who inhabited the area before and during the Roman Empire (Euganei, ancient Veneti, Raeti, Carni, and Cenomani); to the Medieval duchies of Bavaria and Carinthia, Patriarchate of Aquileia and comuni; to the Republic of Venice and the Austrian Empire. Currently, Italian is used as the official language in all the regions, but other local languages are spoken by the population: Venetian, Friulian, German, Ladin, and Slovene, in their several dialects. German is a co-official language in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol; Friulian is co-official language in Friuli-Venezia Giulia; Slovene (Friuli-Venezia Giulia) and Ladin (Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol) are co-official languages in some municipalities.

The Orthe series consists of the books Golden Witchbreed (published 1983) and Ancient Light (1987) and the short story \\"The Crystal Sunlight, the Bright Air\\" (1983). The action in both books takes place on a distant planet called Orthe, which is visited by Lynne de Lisle Christie, a British envoy from a not very far future Earth that has developed a spacefaring civilization. Plot summary As Golden Witchbreed opens, Christie has arrived on the technologically backward planet of Orthe (\\"Carrick V\\"), having been sent to evaluate whether it is suitable for trade and cultural contact with Earth. But Orthe, though possessing a complex social and political structure, turns out to have deliberately reverted to more primitive technologies after a catastrophe brought about by a previous technologically advanced race, the \\"Golden Witchbreed\\" or \\"Goldens\\". Unlike the Ortheans, Christie is blonde, which engenders hostility towards her as some take her to be a Witchbreed throwback. Orthe consists largely of two continents, both of them only partially habitable since the catastrophe and linked by an archipelago of islands which supports a gigantic ruined Witchbreed structure, a kind of combined city and viaduct called the Rasrhe-y-Meluur. The main concentration of Ortheans is in the Suthai-Telestre or Southland (the habitable southern portion of the Northern continent), also known as the Hundred Thousand (meaning the approximately 100,000 telestres or small self-supporting communities which are the basis of Orthean society; they elect a ruler, the Crown, every ten years who rules from the island city of Tathcaer). Isolated cities of very different culture cling to the coast of the desert Southern continent. Male and female Ortheans have social parity and authority; Orthean children do not become male or female until puberty and a few remain latent throughout their lives - children and latents are referred to by the neutral pronoun ke. Much of the novel concerns Christie's odyssey and adventures across the Suthai-Telestre, in the course of which she encounters fragmentary remains of the Witchbreed's civilization and is frequently in danger of her life. Early in the novel she befriends the charismatic Ruric Orhlandis, the one-armed female commander of the Southland army. After (just) surviving her journey through the Southlands Christie is summoned to the southern-continent city of Kasabaarde, whose Brown Tower is ruled by the mysterious 'Hexenmeister' who preserves the memory of all generations on Orthe, going back to the very alien race who first landed there and died out but brought the humanoid Witchbreed as their servitors. The half-breed survivors of the Witchbreed now live in the far southern city of Kel Harantish. Eventually Christie learns that Ruric has been behind the many attempts to kill or frame her, fearing what the corrupting Earth influence might do to Orthe. Ruric is imprisoned, escapes, fights a bitter, hopeless civil war and is driven into exile. Christie leaves the planet in sombre mood. In Ancient Light, Christie returns to Orthe ten years later, this time as an unwilling representative of an Earth company that is looking for the lost technological secrets of the almost-extinct Witchbreed race that had destroyed its own civilization in Orthe's distant past, in order to exploit them. Political cohesion has been lost and, at the same time, war is developing between two groups on Orthe, worsened by the introduction of high-technology weapons. The novel is bleaker in tone than Golden Witchbreed. Characters from that novel are re-encountered, older, changed, more cynical; others are dead. Christie experiences visions of the fall of the Golden Empire. She returns to Kasabaarde and discovers the new Hexenmeister is Ruric Orhlandis. Violence and killing spread: eventually in confused fighting in Tathcaer Ruric is killed. Christie buries her and prepares to become Hexenmeister in her stead by means of the memory transfer systems in the Brown Tower. They are destroyed before she can reach Kasabaarde by a vast explosion caused by the release of the Witchbreed weapon known as 'Ancient Light', a destroyer of organic life that leaves only crystal in its wake, leaving her with only partial memories of the lives of previous Hexenmeisters, thus preventing her (seemingly) from continuing their legacy.

It differs from prior desktop Macintosh models in that it was built with industry-standard components such as an IDE hard drive and an ATX-like power supply. The 4400 was introduced to the market at a time when several Macintosh clones were available on the market, often at prices lower than Apple's. The \\"Tanzania\\" logic board in the 4400 was an Apple design but had only been used in clones up to this point. MacWEEK's review described the case as \\"Strange in the Apple brood; when compared with PCs it fits right in with the flock. It is contained in a stock desktop PC case fitted with Apple's distinctive curved nose piece. The back is industrial- looking, while bent sheet metal fills the case's insides, sharp edges and all. The IDE drive sits on end, while the Comm II slot (occupied with an Ethernet card) and two PCI slots reside in a riser card. For the first time, Apple has abandoned automatic switching in the power supply, a small cost savings at the expense of international users' convenience.\\" This was the only Power Macintosh to be designed with the goal of using low-cost manufacturing techniques; the 4400 was removed from Apple's lineup a few months after the Power Macintosh G3 Desktop went on sale, which was priced comparably to the 4400 but used Apple's Power Macintosh 7300 form factor instead.  Models  Rear view of the Power Macintosh 4400/200 and Power Macintosh 7220/200 Internal view of the Power Macintosh 4400/200 and Power Macintosh 7220/200 The initial 4400/160 model was only sold to the European market. Some of Apple's online literature referred to the machine as the \\"Performa 4400\\", owing to its entry-level position in the market, but no machine sold was labelled as such. (The Performa brand was formally retired a few months later.) An updated 200 MHz 603e model was released in the United States in February 1997 as the Power Macintosh 4400/200. It was also available as a \\"PC Compatible\\" system with a 166 MHz DOS card containing 16 MB of RAM and a Cyrix 6x86 processor. The Power Macintosh 4400 was sold as the Power Macintosh 7220 in Australia and Asia, where the number 4 is considered unlucky, and to prevent confusion with the Power Macintosh 7200. Introduced November 7, 1996: * Power Macintosh 4400/160: Sold in Europe; no L2 cache or Ethernet. Introduced February 17, 1997: The 200 MHz versions support a maximum RAM capacity of 160 MB, and have an updated PCI adapter card has two PCI slots and one Comm II slot, instead of three PCI slots. * Power Macintosh 4400/200: Sold worldwide, except the Far East. * Power Macintosh 7220/200: Sold in Far East countries, e.g. Japan and Australia.

History Benedict XIV, by his bull Dei miseratione of 3 November 1741, introduced this official into the marriage procedure to guard against abuses occurring from the ordinary procedure. An annulment of a marriage might result from the appearance of only the spouse who desired freedom to enter upon a new marriage, while the other was apathetic and conniving at the annulment, or at times unable or indisposed to incur expense to uphold the marriage, especially if it required an appeal to a higher court. Scandal arose from the frequency of dissolution of marriages with the freedom to enter new contracts. Qualifications and obligations The bull requires that in each diocese, the ordinary appoint a defender of marriage, upright in character, and learned in the law, an ecclesiastic if possible, a layman if necessary. The bishop may suspend him or remove him for cause, and, if he is prevented from taking part in the procedure, substitute another with the requisite qualifications. Proceedings in first instance He must be summoned to any trial in which there is question, before a competent judge, of the validity or nullity of a marriage, and any proceeding will be null if he is not duly cited. He must have the opportunity to examine the witnesses, and, orally or in writing, to bring forward whatever arguments may favour the validity of the marriage. He must be cited even though the party interested in the defence of the marriage be present, and all the acts of the court are always to be accessible to him, and at any time he has a right to bring forward new documents or witnesses favourable to the marriage. On assuming his office he must take an oath to fulfill his duties and he is expected to renew the oath in each case. If the judge decides in favour of the marriage the defender takes no further action unless its opponent appeals to a higher court. Here a defender undertakes anew the defence of its validity. If the judge of the first instance decides against the validity of the marriage and no one else appeals, the defender of marriage has the right to appeal to the higher court. If he feels it his duty to appeal, a new marriage may not be contracted until his plea is heard. This canon legislation was extended and enforced in the United States by an Instruction of Propaganda in 1883, published with the Acts and Decrees of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore. Though the bull does not require it, the practice of the Roman church extends the intervention of the defender to cases of true marriages not consummated where the Holy See is requested to grant a dispensation for a new marriage. Proceedings in second instance The obligation of the defender to appeal from the decision of first instance adverse to the validity of a marriage has been modified by the Holy See in several cases where the invalidity depends upon facts indisputably proven. Where the decree \\"Tametsi\\" of the Council of Trent was binding, requiring the presence of the parish priest for the validity, if only a civil ceremony was used, the bishop may declare the marriage null without the participation of the defender. In view of new matrimonial law contained in the decree \\"Ne Temere\\" of Pius X this also holds anywhere if a marriage is attempted only before a civil authority or non- Catholic minister of religion. Yet if an ecclesiastical form had been used, and the nullity from clandestinity was questioned, the presence of the defender is required; but if the impediment of clandestinity clearly appears he need not appeal. This is true also if, through absence of ecclesiastical dispensation, there is an impediment of disparity of worship, or of consanguinity, or of affinity from lawful intercourse, or of spiritual relationship, or of certain previous legitimate marriage still existing. In these cases the ordinary may, with the participation of the defender, declare the marriage null, and the defender is not required to appeal. This, however, was declared by the Holy Office (27 May 1901) to be understood only of cases in which certainly and clearly the impediment is proven; otherwise the defender must proceed to the higher court. The defender is exhorted to exercise his office gratuitously, but he may be compensated from fees imposed by the court or from other diocesan resources. Briefs submitted to the tribunal by the defender of the bond are considered part of the \\"acts\\" of the case and the parties have a right to view and comment on the acts before the decision is made by the judge(s).

Odubanjo, I.O Sanya and others in 1918. The denomination has over 3 million adherents worldwide. The term \\"Aladura\\" means \\"praying people\\" in Yoruba. Aladura churches emphasize the power of prayer. They believe in faith healing and various elements associated with Pentecostalism. Most of the founders were associated with Anglicanism, joined by some Methodists. The churches reject the power of traditional African religion as malign. They sometimes burn cult images as \\"idols\\" and oppose both polygamy and witchcraft. Unlike Kimbanguism, the churches tend to avoid politics and focus instead on the \\"holiness movement\\". The Aladura movement started at Ijebu-Ode, Nigeria in 1918. This movement later metamorphosed to Living Faith Church Worldwide (whose headquarters is the Faith Tabernacle) and to the Christ Apostolic Church. Today, many churches in Western Nigeria can be correctly called \\"Aladura\\".  Divisions  They can be categorized into Pentecostals and Spiritualists. The popular Aladura indigenous churches are:  Aladura Pentecostals  Christ Apostolic Church, popularly called CAC, is the precursor of Aladura Pentecostalism. *Christ Apostolic Church *Redeemed Christian Church of God *Mountain of Fire Ministries *Deeper Life Bible Church  Aladura Spiritualists  The Aladura Spiritualists are also called \\"White Garment\\" churches. *Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim and Seraphim *Church of the Lord (Aladura) *Celestial Church of Christ *Celica Church of Christ  Pentecostals =Christ Apostolic Church The first Aladura movement emerged from St. Saviour's Anglican Church, Ijebu-Ode, Nigeria in 1918. The Sexton, Ali, related a dream to four church elders, J.B. Sadare, E.O. Onabanjo, D.C. Oduga and E.O.W. Olukoya. They started vigorous prayer sessions. They initiated the \\"Prayer Band\\", popularly called \\"Egbe Aladura\\". After D.O. Odubanjo joined the movement in 1919, they became influenced by the doctrines of the Faith Tabernacle of Philadelphia. They rejected infant baptism and all forms of medicine, whether western or traditional. This led to a doctrinal conflict with the Anglican Church and they were forced out of the church. Joseph Sadare was compelled to give up his post in the Synod and others were forced to resign their jobs and to withdraw their children from the Anglican School. The Aladura movement began as a renewal movement in search of true spirituality.Abi Olowe; Great Revivals, Great Revivalist – Joseph Ayo Babalola, Omega Publishers, 2007 A revival took place in 1918 during the influenza pandemic. The group filled with the Holy Ghost claim to have used prayer to save many lives affected by the epidemic. This consolidated the prayer group. The movement grew gradually and formed branches throughout Nigeria. The name of the group went through several changes, such as Prayer Band, Precious Stone, Diamond Society, and Faith Tabernacle, in that order, until 1930. A great revival started in July 1930 by the raising of a dead body by Apostle Joseph Ayo Babalola at Oke-Oye in Ilesa. People traveled from neighboring cities and countries to receive healing at Ilesa. Several people were healed through the power of prayer amid evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The revival lasted about 60 days and is regarded as the greatest revival ever in Nigeria. Faith Tabernacle of Nigeria later invited the Apostolic Church of England in 1931 to form an Association that lasted until 1939. The Revival group went through additional name changes until, 24 years after its formation, it settled on the name Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) in 1942. Today, CAC has spread worldwide and is the precursor of Aladura Pentecostal Churches in Nigeria. The Church established schools at all levels, including Joseph Ayo Babalola University.Abi Olowe, Babalola Miracle Center, Omega Publishers 2007 Several other churches of Christ Apostolic Church.  Spiritualists =Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim and Seraphim Moses Orimolade Tunolase, who was later called Baba Aladura, or Praying Father, founded the Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim and Seraphim in 1925, also as a prayer group within the Anglican Church. Captain Christiana Abiodun's adopted daughter fell into a trance and Moses Orimolade Tunolase, who was already an itinerant evangelist and teacher, was the only one who could awaken her. By 1925 they had left the Anglican church to become independent. Their most distinctive ministry was to openly identify and challenge witches on evangelistic journeys through the countryside. These long trips were typical of Cherubim and Seraphim (as they are most commonly called) evangelists and missionaries. Today the church is one of the most popular, most attractive and most influential of the Aladura churches worldwide. The Church of the Lord (Aladura) Josiah Ollunowo Ositelu founded the Church of the Lord (Aladura) on 27 July 1930 at Ile Lisa, Ogere-Remo, Ogun state. Ositelu was born in 1902 to Dawodu Ositelu and Madam Rebecca Ejironike. His parents named him \\"Fakoya\\" at birth; however, Ositelu told his father he was \\"Oyelowo\\" and his baby brother should be called \\"Oyeleke\\". Eventually, Ositelu became School Master Catechist at Orile Imo – Ishan – Erukute, Asha, Erunbe (Oko Egba). Ositelu used only cold water all his life to bathe and drink, and never ate pork. Ositelu also went on missionary journeys throughout Nigeria, Liberia, Ghana and Sierra Leone. Celestial Church of Christ The Celestial Church of Christ (usually known as Cele) was founded in 1947 by Samuel Oshoffa in Porto Novo, Benin.  Celica Church of Christ  Celica Church of Christ was established through the injunction of the Holy Spirit on November 15, 1992, at Ibadan, Oyo State and was announced via a press conference on that day. In extra research on the name of the church, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), London program on Africa stated that the word Celica has its origin in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek languages. From Latin, it means heavenly or Celestial. The name of the church translated spiritually is the Most Glorious Church of Christ from Heaven. The founder of the church is Emmanuel Adetunji Adeonigbagbe. Its international headquarters is located in Ibadan. The church has branches in Nigeria and a presence in the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States of America, Cote d'Ivoire and South Africa. The church can be distinguished by its chant of Hosanna and the mode of dressing, a white garment with a blue cross on the left-hand side. The church logo is an eye, a cross and a Bible. The church believes in the efficacy of prayers and guidance by the Holy Spirit in all its programs.\\"The voice from Celica\\" $nVolume I edited by A. 'Sesan Ayodele, Adetunji Adeonigbagbe.

Released in July 1983 on the Situation Two label, the EP reached No. 2 on the UK Independent Chart. The EP is often erroneously referred to as Brothers Grimm (after the song title of the first track on the A-side of the record). In 1988, the EP was released on compact disc coupled with the contents of the group's only other official release, \\"Gods Zoo\\", retaining the same eponymous title. In 1996, the contents of the 1988 CD release were remastered and reissued with an additional four tracks from a BBC Radio 1 session. This release was titled Ghost Dance. Development Death Cult formed in April 1983 when Ian Astbury (formerly of Southern Death Cult) and Billy Duffy (formerly of Theatre of Hate) joined forces after meeting each other when Southern Death Cult supported Theatre of Hate on a number of dates during the latter's tour. By June 1983, the group had written 10 songs, four of which would be recorded for their debut EP. The first track, \\"Brothers Grimm\\", was originally written by Duffy and UK Decay vocalist Steve \\"Abbo\\" Abbott after both musicians had left their respective bands (and prior to Duffy joining Astbury to form Death Cult). Two of the songs delved into Astbury's respect and fascination with the Native American cultures previously explored during his tenure with Southern Death Cult. \\"Ghost Dance\\" was inspired by the Ghost Dance religious movement as well as the writings and teachings of spiritual leader Wovoka, whose name is mentioned in the lyrics (\\"Wovoka had a vision\\"...), while the lyrics to \\"Horse Nation\\" were taken nearly verbatim from the book Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Astbury and Duffy's interest in the Vietnam War was also in evidence, both in the photograph that appeared on the picture sleeve, as well as the lyrical content of the final track, \\"Christians\\", which directly referenced the war and featured lyrics referring to the Chiêu Hồi program and the tiger stripe camouflage pattern worn by United States infantrymen. At the time, certain groups within the British post punk subculture developed a \\"trendy\\" fascination with the Vietnam War that spilled over into dress and music. According to Astbury: :\\"My interest in Viet Nam started when I saw 'Apocalypse Now'. What they were doing was the closest to some uplifting experience that you can get\\". During Death Cult's 1983 tour, Duffy was often seen wearing a green beret with a Vietnam War-era 5th Special Forces Group beret flash along with tiger stripe fatigues.Billy Duffy, \\"Death Cult 1983\\" Duffy has posted images, on his website, of his original green beret (with 5th Special Forces Group beret flash) as well as him wearing a different green beret (with a U.S. Special Forces crest attached to it) during live performances in 1983. Duffy later referred to it as \\"Apocalypse Now chic\\".Billy Duffy, \\"Death Cult Apocalypse Now Chic\\" Original 1983 EP The original EP was released only in 12\\" format, solely in the United Kingdom, France and Japan. The photograph that appeared on the front sleeve was taken by renowned Vietnam War photographer Tim Page. The group's logo and the lettering on the EP picture sleeve were done by bassist Jaime Stewart.Billy Duffy, \\"Death Cult's First Press Release\\" The initial UK 12\\" release included a folded A4 insert written by Tom Vague which included information on the group in the form of a series of short interviews.

This CD collected the original EP along with the single \\"Gods Zoo\\". The material was allegedly remastered, but no evidence exists to support this claim.

This new collection was released in the UK and US simultaneously (marking the first time Death Cult material was released in the US). The compact disc collection featured new artwork and was given the title Ghost Dance. In addition to the material from the 1988 compact disc, the 1997 CD appended a four-track David Jensen BBC Radio 1 session engineered by Dale Griffin and broadcast on 27 October 1983. One of these BBC tracks, \\"A Flower in the Desert\\", was a rewritten version of \\"Flowers in the Forest\\", originally written and recorded by Astbury's earlier group Southern Death Cult. This track had previously been released as the B-side to the 1984 \\"Spiritwalker\\" single, released shortly after the group changed its name to the Cult. \\"Too Young\\" was later rewritten as \\"Rider in the Snow\\", appearing as such on the group's debut album, Dreamtime. \\"With Love\\" was originally titled \\"The Waste of Love\\", and only changed to \\"With Love\\" when it was recorded during the BBC radio session. The song was later rewritten and recorded (as the Cult) during the \\"Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)\\" recording sessions on 22 June 1984, under the working title of \\"Ship of Fools\\". The track was then retitled \\"Sea and Sky\\" and released as the B-side of the \\"Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)\\" single.

Founded in 1854 by the Sisters of St. Joseph, it turned 150 years old in the school year 2004-2005 and turned 160 years old in the school year 2014-2015. In the year 2010-2011, the Fraser Institute ranked St. Joseph's College amongst the top 5% of Ontario schools.  History and tradition  St. Joseph’s College School was founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Toronto in 1854, three years after the first nuns from the order came to the city. The roots of the Congregation began in LePuy, France, when the Sisters of St. Joseph was established in 1648 by a French Jesuit named Jean Paul Médaille. Originally called “St. Joseph’s Academy for Young Ladies,” the name was changed to “St. Joseph’s College School, a Boarding and Day School for the Higher and Primary Education of Young Ladies and Little Girls” when the school moved to Bay and St. Alban’s Street in 1863. In 1927, the school was renamed “St. Joseph’s College School” when it was moved to a building separate from the convent. St. Joseph’s College has a history of promoting girls’ and women’s education. In 1911, the school requested to be affiliated with the University of Toronto--a request the then-president of the university, Sir Robert Falconer, granted. St. Joseph’s was officially tied to St. Michael’s College, the Roman Catholic college of the University of Toronto, in 1912. This resulted in women being able to take courses at St. Michael’s College for the first time. In 1928, the Academy was renamed St. Joseph’s College School. When the Ontario government purchased the convent property to construct four office towers, the Sisters of St. Joseph relocated the College School across the street at its present location. Students helped with the move, carrying furniture across Wellesley Street. St. Joseph’s College School on 74 Wellesley Street West opened on September 3, 1961. In 1967, it entered an agreement with the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now The Toronto Catholic District School Board) where Grades 9 and 10 were placed into the publicly funded system, while later grades continued to pay tuition. The school also operated the commercial school on Sherbourne Street for secretarial skills. This school became co-educational and renamed to Thomas Merton Catholic Secondary School in 1985. In 1984, the Ontario government expanded funding in Grades 11-13, the College School became entirely publicly funded in 1987 as it was ceased as a private school, at which time the Sisters leased the school to the Metropolitan Separate School Board. The last Sister of St. Joseph to serve as principal retired in June 1996 (Sister Conrad Lauber). The Toronto Catholic District School Board has owned the College School property since December 2007. On May 31, 2012, the head janitor of SJCS, Vincent Perna, was charged with attempted murder as police alleged Perna went to the staff room and tried to help kitchen staff light a stove after a gas line had been severed in the basement of the school. https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2012/06/01/students_and_parents_shocked_as_toronto_girls_school_custodian_charged_in_explosion_plot.html  Education  St. Joseph’s College School offers a full-time Extended French program, a variety of Advanced Placement and enriched courses, and a wide range of classes in the sciences and the humanities. Additionally, the Arts Department offers drama, visual arts, music, and new media arts programming. Drama students, for example, have taken part in the Sears Ontario Drama FestivalSears Ontario Drama Festival. St. Joseph's regularly scores within the top 10% of schools on the Education Quality and Accountability Office's standardised tests.http://www.tcdsb.org/sites/CommonData/OSSLT/StJosephsCollege20082009OSSLT.pdf The school also has a Gifted education program and an Enriched program. Through these, students are able to take part in a number of activities, including Encounters With Canada, the University of Toronto Mentorship Program, model United Nations conferences, the Queen’s University Enrichment Studies Unit, the University of Toronto Gifted Conference, Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge, and the University of Waterloo's various mathematics competitions.

Shehu Usman dan Fodio established a government in Northern Nigeria based on Islam before the advent of colonialism. The British colonial government therefore established indirect rule in Northern Nigeria based on the structure of this government. Islam also came to South Western Yoruba-speaking areas during the time of Mansa Musa's Mali Empire. The vast majority of Muslims in Nigeria are Sunni belonging to Maliki school of jurisprudence; however, a sizeable minority also belongs to Shafi madhhab. Many Sunni Muslims are members of Sufi brotherhoods. Most Sufis follow the Qadiriyya, Tijaniyyah or Mouride movement. Nigerian Islam has become heterogenous with the springing up of many Islamic sects. Notable examples are the Izala movement,nigerian Izala movement the Shia movement, and many local Islamic sects that have limited expansion. =Shia= The Shia Muslims of Nigeria are primarily located in the Sokoto State. Shia Muslims make up between two and four million of Nigeria's population. Nigeria: 'No Settlement With Iran Yet', Paul Ohia, allAfrica - This Day, 16 November 2010. Ibrahim Zakzaky introduced many Nigerians to Shia Islam. =Sufi= Some Nigerian Muslims emphasize asceticism and mysticism and usually form groups called \\"tariqas\\", \\"Sufi orders\\" or \\"Sufi brotherhoods\\". They always preach peaceful co-existence and had no empathy for radical Islam. Most Sufis follow the Qadiriyya, Tijaniyyah or Mouride movement. =Ahmadiyya= The Ahmadiyya movement established itself in Nigeria in 1916,Ahmadiyya Muslim Mosques Around the World, p. 95 and make up approximately 3% of the Muslim population. There are numerous Ahmadiyya centres in Nigeria including the Baitur-Raheem Mosque in Ibadan inaugurated in 2008,http://www.alislam.org report of Khalifatul Masih V’s West African tour the Mubarak Mosque in Abuja, which is the last Ahmadiyya mosque, built in the first century of the Ahmadiyya Caliphate.Ahmadiyya Muslim Mosques Around the World, p. 34 Ahmadiyyas have also established a weekly newspaper called \\"The Truth\\" which is the first Muslim newspaper in the country.Ahmadiyya Muslim Mosques Around the World, p. 99 =Quraniyoon= The Kala Kato are a Nigerian group of Quranists. Their name means \\"a mere man said it\\" referring to the narrators of the sayings of Muhammad. The Kalo Kato rely entirely on the Quran and they are found among poor communities across northern Nigeria. =Boko Haram and Darul Islam= Islam in Nigeria has witnessed a rise in the numbers of Islamic extremism notably among them, the Boko Haram, Maitatsine, Darul Islam among others. These sects have sometimes resorted to the use of violence in a bid to realizing their ambitions on the wider Islamic and Nigerian populations as a whole. The rise of this radical movements has been attributed partly to the poor socio economic infrastructures and poor governance in Nigeria. Poverty has been seen as the major catalyst leading to the rapid increase in the membership of these religious extremist groups.Borno bolsters security after attacks The rise of these sects has also been linked to the increase and aiding of religious extremist by politicians for their selfish ambitions. During the 1980s religious riots occurred in and around the five cities of Kano in 1980, Kaduna in 1982, Bulum-Ketu in 1982, Jimeta in 1984 and Gombe in 1985. These riots were caused by the migration of the rural poor into urban towns during the dry seasons. An offshoot of Islam called the ‘Yan Tatsine’ violently rebelled against the authorities and non-members. These radical Muslims were inspired by Alhaji Mohammed Marwa Maitatsine. He was a Cameroon preacher who slated the government, something which led to his arrest in Nigeria in 1975, yet by 1972 many people followed him across society, ranging from the elite to Koranic students called almajiral or gardawa and unemployed migrants. Maitatsine and his followers became separate from orthodox Islam, condemning the corruption of the religious and secular elites and the wealthy upper classes’ consumption of Western goods during the petrol boom in 1974–81.Paul M. Lubeck, \\"Islamic Protest under Semi-Capitalism: ‘ Yan Tatsine Explained\\", Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, 55.4, (1985) 369-389, pp. 369–370 The Boko Haram movement has been connected to the Maitatsine movement. They want to implement sharia law across the whole of Nigeria.Toni Johnson, \\"Boko Haram\\", Council on Foreign Relations, 31 August 2011, < http://www.cfr.org/africa/boko-haram/p25739> [accessed on 1/11/2011] Christianity The National Church of Nigeria Nigeria has the largest Christian population in Africa though Christians are about 48% of the population. According to a 2011 Pew report, over 80 million Nigerians are Christians. Among Christians, about a quarter are Catholic, three quarters are Protestant, and about 750,000 belong to other Christian denominations and a few of them are Orthodox Christians. The leading Protestant churches in the country are the Church of Nigeria of the Anglican Communion, The African Church, the Assemblies of God Church, the Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC) and The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (SCOAN). The Yoruba area contains a large Anglican population, while Igboland is predominantly Catholic and the Edo area is predominantly Assemblies of God, which was introduced into Nigeria by Augustus Ehurie Wogu and his associates at Old Umuahia. The Nigerian Baptist Convention claims about three million baptized members. From the 1990s to the 2000s, there was significant growth in Protestant churches, including the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Living Faith Church (Winners' Chapel), Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) (the first Aladura Movement in Nigeria), Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Mountain of Fire and Miracles (MFM), Christ Embassy, Common Wealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Aladura Church (indigenous Christian churches being especially strong in the Yoruba and Igbo areas), and of evangelical churches in general. These churches have spilled over into adjacent and southern areas of the middle belt. Denominations like the Seventh-day Adventist also exist. There are over 300,000 Early Pentecostal Apostolic Churches parishes in Nigeria having about 4.2 million adherents. Such denominations in this group are: # The Christ Apostolic Church, # The Apostolic Church, # The Celestial Church, # The Cherubim and Seraphim Church et cetera. There are also about 380,000 New Apostolic Church parishes constituting about 6.5 million believersNew Apostolic Christians in Nigeria include: 1) The Redeemed Church, 4) Deeper Life Church, 5) Overcomers' Ministries and other new springs. Bye and large, Protestantism particularly the Pentecostals, Apostolic and evangelicals constitute the major Christian population of Nigeria from the late 1990s to the present. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS) announced creation of new Owerri mission in Nigeria in 2016. =Roman Catholicism= The Archdioceses of the Roman Catholic Church are: Abuja, Onitsha, Benin City, Calabar, Ibadan, Lagos, and Owerri. It has about 19 million members in Nigeria in 2005. Cardinal Francis Arinze is a Roman Catholic Cardinal from Nigeria. =Anglicanism= The ecclesiastical provinces of the Church of Nigeria are: Lagos, Ibadan, Ondo, Bendel, The Niger, Niger Delta, Owerri, Abuja, Kaduna and Jos. Its primate is Nicholas Okoh. The Church of Nigeria has about 17 million members. =Christian distribution= Holy Ghost depicted on a relief in Onitsha The majority of Christians are found in the south east, South-South, south west and Middle- belt region. An increasing number of mission stations and mission bookstores, along with churches serving southern enclaves and northern Christians in the northern cities and larger towns, are found in the Muslim north. Christianity in Yoruba area traditionally has been Protestant and Anglican, currently Protestant Pentecostal/evangelicals, whereas Igboland has always been the area of greatest activity by the Roman Catholic Church with current infusions of Protestantism. Other denominations abounded as well. Presbyterians arrived in the late 17th century in the Ibibio, Annang and Efik land and the Niger Delta area and had missions in the middle belt as well. The works of the Presbyterian Church in Calabar from Scotland by missionaries like Rev Hope M. Waddell, who arrived in Calabar 10 April 1846, in the 19th century and that of Mary Slessor of Calabar are examples. Small missionary movements were allowed to start up, generally in the 1920s, after the middle belt was considered pacified. Each denomination set up rural networks by providing schooling and health facilities. Most such facilities remained in 1990, although in many cases schools had been taken over by the local state government in order to standardize curricula and indigenize the teaching staff . Pentecostals arrived mostly as indigenous workers in the post-independence period, and in the 1980s, Evangelical and Apostolic Pentecostalism were spreading rapidly throughout the south western and middle belt, having major success in hitherto Roman Catholic and Protestant towns of the south as well . There were also breakaway, or Africanized churches, that blended traditional Christian symbols with indigenous symbols. Among these was the Aladura (prayer) movement that was spreading rapidly throughout Yoruba land and into the non-Muslim middle belt areas. =Missionary work= Apart from Benin and Warri, which had come in contact with Christianity through the Portuguese as early as the 15th century, most missionaries arrived by sea in the 19th century. As with other areas in African continent, Roman Catholics and Anglicans each tended to establish areas of hegemony in southern Nigeria. After World War I, smaller denominations such as the Church of the Brethren (as Ekklesiyar Yan'uwa a Nigeria), Seventh-day Adventists and others worked in interstitial areas, trying not to compete. Although less well-known, African-American churches entered the missionary field in the 19th century and created contacts with Nigeria that lasted well into the colonial period. Also, during this period, Jehovah's Witnesses began their missionary work in Nigeria and soon spread throughout the countryhttps://wol.jw.org/en/wol/library/r1/lp-e/all- publications/books/yearbooks/yearbook-1986 =Offshoots of European denominations= African churches were founded by small groups breaking off from the European denominations, especially in Yorubaland, where such independence movements started as early as the early 19th century—influenced by American and British missionaries in early 1900s and stimulated by the great revival of the 1930s. They were for the most part ritually and doctrinally identical to the parent church, although more African music, and later dance and dressage/vesture, entered and mixed with the imported church services. Notable among the new springs of 1930 were such Protestant Pentecostals as the Christ Apostolic Church—an offshoot of US-based Faith Tabernacle which swept through the Western Region and complemented by the likes of the Celestial Church and the Cherubim and Seraphim Church which were indigenous autonomous springs. A number of indigenous denominations used Biblical references to support polygamy. With political independence came African priests in both Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations. Rituals and forms of worship were strictly those of the home country of the original missionaries. By the 1980s, African music and even dancing were being introduced quietly into western oriented church services, albeit altered to fit into rituals of Euro-American origin. Southern Christians living in the north, especially in larger cities, had congregations and churches founded as early as the 1920s. Even medium-sized towns (20,000 persons or more) with an established southern enclave had local churches, especially in the middle belt, where both major religions had a strong foothold. The exodus of Igbo from the north in the late 1960s left Roman Catholic churches poorly attended. By the 1980s adherents were back in even greater numbers, and a number of new churches had been built. The middle belt and the west and southwest of Nigeria remain the hold of Protestants (Pentecostal, evangelical and indigenous spring of Christian denominations). =Combination with traditional practices= The Aladura, like several other breakaway churches, stress healing and fulfillment of life goals for oneself and one's family. African beliefs that sorcery and witchcraft are malevolent forces against which protection is required are accepted; rituals are warm and emotional, stressing personal involvement and acceptance of spirit possession. Theology is biblical, but some sects add costumed processions and some accept polygyny. =Social class and religion= Major congregations of the larger Anglican and Roman Catholic missions represented elite families of their respective areas, although each of these churches had members from all levels and many quite humble church buildings. Nevertheless, a wedding in the Anglican cathedral in Lagos was usually a gathering of the elite of the entire country, and of Lagos and Yorubaland in particular. Such families had connections to their churches going back to the 19th century and were generally not attracted to the breakaway churches. All major urban centers, all universities, and the new capital of Abuja had areas set aside for the major religions to build churches and mosques and for burial grounds. Baháʼí Faith After an isolated presence in the late 1920s, the Baháʼí Faith in Nigeria begins with pioneering Baháʼís coming to Sub-Saharan West Africa in the 1950s especially following the efforts of Enoch Olinga who directly and indirectly affected the growth of the religion in Nigeria. Following growth across West Africa a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1956. As the community multiplied across cities and became diverse in its engagements it elected its own National Spiritual Assembly by 1979 and Operation World estimated 1000 Baháʼís in 2001 though the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 34,000 Baháʼís in 2005. Traditional beliefs Alongside the main religious sect is the traditional belief system that without contradicting civil law manages to also govern ethics and morality amongst much of the population. Traditional religion among the Yorubas Oṣogbo, Nigeria. Within the city and states of Yorubaland as well as its neighbors, a more reserved way of life expresses a theology that links local beliefs to a centrally placed government and its sovereignty over the neighbourhood or communities through the monarch, the king. The seat of the king (oba) is chiefly responsible for the welfare of its subjects, as a confirmation of the legitimacy of the oba's (king) rule over his subjects. Practices In addition to ensuring access to, and the continual fertility of, both land and people, seasonal carnivals act as a spectacle for \\"tourism\\" contributing to regional productivity. Meanwhile, the practices are not the same; they have some similarities and differences. The acts in a given traditional carnival is dependent on the type of gods or goddesses to be worshiped. While tradiional carnivals usually attracts tourists, fun seekers, and community people, it is also good to note that there certain forbidden acts which prevent people from doing cerain things, probably before and during the carnivals. > \\"Society in general has more gradually and selectively expanded to > accommodate new influences, it is fairly certain that they will continue to > assert their distinctive cultural identity in creative and often ingenious > ways\\". Inter-religious conflict In the 1980s, serious outbreaks between Christians and Muslims occurred in Kafanchan in southern Kaduna State in a border area between the two religions, propagated by extreme leaders who were able to rally a young, educated group of individuals who feared that the nation would not be able to protect their religious group.Jibrin Ibrahim, \\"Politics of religion in Nigeria: The Parameters of the 1987 Crisis in Kadana State\\", Review of African Political Economy, 45 (1989), 65-82. pp. 65–68 < https://www.jstor.org/stable/4006011> [accessed on 01/11/2011] The leaders were able to polarize their followers through speeches and public demonstrations.Ibrahim, p. 65 The activities of some of these sects has in recent times led to the loss of lives and properties as they move about destroying government facilities which they see as legacies or replica of western cultures in their various communities. These religious campaigns have seen an increase in gun battles between the members of these sects and security forces with loss of lives witnessed on both sides. Although direct conflicts between Christians and Muslims were rare, tensions did flare between the two groups as each group radicalised. There were clashes in October 1982 when Muslim zealots in Kano were able to enforce their power in order to keep the Anglican House Church from expanding its size and power base as they saw it as a threat to the nearby Mosque, even though the Anglican House Church had been there forty years prior to the building of the Mosque.Ibrahim, pp. 65-66 Additionally, there were two student groups in Nigeria who came into contestation, the Fellowship of Christian Students and the Muslim Student Society. In one instance there was an evangelical campaign organised by the FCS and brought into question why one sect should dominate the campus of the Kafanchan college of education. This quarrel accelerated to the point where the Muslim students organised protests around the city and culminated in the burning of a Mosque at the college. The Christian majority at the college retaliated on March 9 when 12 people died and several Mosques were burnt and a climate of fear brews. The retaliation was pre-planned.Ibrahim, pp. 66–68 Exploitation of the media used to propagate the ideas of the conflict, thereby radicalising each force even more. Media was biased on each side so while places like the federal radio corporation discussed the idea of defending Islam during this brief moment of terror but does not report the deaths and damage caused by Muslims, galvanising the Muslim population. Similarly, the Christian papers did not report the damage and deaths caused by Christians but focused on the Islamic terror.Ibrahim, pp. 67–70 Other individuals leading these religious movements use the media to spread messages which gradually became more intolerant of other religions.Ibrahim, p. 72 AtheismOther religions=Hinduism Hinduism spread to Nigeria mainly by immigration of Hindus from India and of Hare Krishna Missionaries. Many Nigerians have converted to Hinduism mainly due to efforts of ISKCON Missionaries. ISKCON has inaugurated the Vedic Welfare Complex in Apapa.\\"Adherents by Location\\", Adherents.com, Accessed 19 May 2007. Altogether including Nigerians of Indian origin and NRIs there are 25,0000 Hindus in Nigeria. Most of them live in Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria. Chrislam Chrislam is a blend of Christianity and Islam that takes practices from both the Bible and the Quran. It hopes to quell religious feuds among Nigerians.\\"In African, Islam and Christianity are growing - and blending\\", csmonitor.com, Accessed 19 May 2007.

The Grail Movement is not an organisation in the usual legal sense, but a collective term for all kinds of endeavours to spread the knowledge of the Grail Message and to utilise it in all walks of life. The associating of adherents of the Grail Message creates the foundation and the outer setting for the holding of hours for the joint worship of God (Hours of Worship) and Grail Festivals. Facilitating such hours for adherents and readers of the Grail Message is - besides the dissemination of the Grail Message - one of the main concerns of the international Grail Movement. The ideative field of activity with its Hours of Worship and Grail Festivals, lecture events, readings, discussion evenings, seminars, events for children and young people, art exhibitions, concerts and more besides, comprises the actual activity of the Movement.

It is also called hydrostatic pressure, and defined as the pressure measured by a fluid, measured at a certain point within itself when at equilibrium. Generally, turgor pressure is caused by the osmotic flow of water and occurs in plants, fungi, and bacteria. The phenomenon is also observed in protists that have cell walls. This system is not seen in animal cells, as the absence of a cell wall would cause the cell to lyse when under too much pressure. The pressure exerted by the osmotic flow of water is called turgidity. It is caused by the osmotic flow of water through a selectively permeable membrane. Osmotic flow of water through a semipermeable membrane is when the water travels from an area with a low-solute concentration, to one with a higher-solute concentration. In plants, this entails the water moving from the low concentration solute outside the cell, into the cell's vacuole. Mechanism 375px Osmosis is the process in which water flows from an area with a low solute concentration, to an adjacent area with a higher solute concentration until equilibrium between the two areas is reached. All cells are surrounded by a lipid bi-layer cell membrane which permits the flow of water in and out of the cell while also limiting the flow of solutes. In hypertonic solutions, water flows out of the cell which decreases the cell's volume. When in a hypotonic solution, water flows into the membrane and increases the cell's volume. When in an isotonic solution, water flows in and out of the cell at an equal rate. Turgidity is the point at which the cell's membrane pushes against the cell wall, which is when turgor pressure is high. When the cell membrane has low turgor pressure, it is flaccid. In plants, this is shown as wilted anatomical structures. This is more specifically known as plasmolysis.137x137pxThe volume and geometry of the cell affects the value of turgor pressure, and how it can have an effect on the cell wall's plasticity. Studies have shown how smaller cells experience a stronger elastic change when compared to larger cells. Turgor pressure also plays a key role in plant cell growth where the cell wall undergoes irreversible expansion due to the force of turgor pressure as well as structural changes in the cell wall that alter its extensibility.Jordan, B.M., and Dumais, J. (2010). \\"Biomechanics of Plant Cell Growth\\". Encyclopedia of Life Sciences.  Turgor pressure in plants  Turgor pressure within cells is regulated by osmosis and this also causes the cell wall to expand during growth. Along with size, rigidity of the cell is also caused by turgor pressure; a lower pressure results in a wilted cell or plant structure (i.e. leaf, stalk). One mechanism in plants that regulate turgor pressure is its semipermeable membrane, which only allows some solutes to travel in and out of the cell, which can also maintain a minimum amount of pressure. Other mechanisms include transpiration, which results in water loss and decreases turgidity in cells. Turgor pressure is also a large factor for nutrient transport throughout the plant. Cells of the same organism can have differing turgor pressures throughout the organism's structure. In higher plants, turgor pressure is responsible for apical growth of things such as root tips and pollen tubes. Dispersal Transport proteins that pump solutes into the cell can be regulated by cell turgor pressure. Lower values allow for an increase in the pumping of solutes; which in turn increases osmotic pressure. This function is important as a plant response when under drought conditions (seeing as turgor pressure is maintained), and for cells which need to accumulate solutes (i.e. developing fruits).  Flowering and reproductive organs  It has been recorded that the petals of Gentiana kochiana and Kalanchoe blossfeldiana bloom via volatile turgor pressure of cells on the plant's adaxial surface. During processes like anther dehiscence, it has been observed that drying endothecium cells cause an outward bending force which led to the release of pollen. This means that lower turgor pressures are observed in these structures due to the fact that they are dehydrated. Pollen tubes are cells which elongate when pollen lands on the stigma, at the carpal tip. These cells grow rather quickly due to increases turgor pressure. These cells undergo tip growth. The pollen tube of lilies can have a turgor pressure of 0–21 MPa when growing during this process.  Seed dispersal  203x203px In fruits such as Impatiens parviflora, Oxalia acetosella and Ecballium elaterium, turgor pressure is the method by which seeds are dispersed. In Ecballium elaterium, or squirting cucumber, turgor pressure builds up in the fruit to the point that aggressively detaches from the stalk, and seeds and water are squirted everywhere as the fruit falls to the ground. Turgor pressure within the fruit ranges from .003 to 1.0 MPa.  Growth  231x231px Turgor pressure's actions on extensible cell walls is usually said to be the driving force of growth within the cell. An increase of turgor pressure causes expansion of cells and extension of apical cells, pollen tubes, and in other plant structures such as root tips. Cell expansion and an increase in turgor pressure is due to inward diffusion of water into the cell, and turgor pressure increases due to the increasing volume of vacuolar sap. A growing root cell's turgor pressure can be up to 0.6 MPa, which is over three times that of a car tire. Epidermal cells in a leaf can have pressures ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 MPa. As plants can operate at such high pressures, this can explain why they can grow through asphalt and other hard surfaces.  Turgidity  Turgidity is observed in a cell where the cell membrane is pushed against the cell wall. In some plants, their cell walls loosen at a quicker rate than water can cross the membrane, which results in a cell with lower turgor pressure.  Stomata  135x135px Turgor pressure within the stomata regulates when the stomata can open and close, which has a play in transpiration rates of the plant. This is also important because this function regulates water loss within the plant. Lower turgor pressure can mean that the cell has a low water concentration and closing the stomata would help to preserve water. High turgor pressure keeps the stomata open for gas exchanges necessary for photosynthesis.  Mimosa pudica  Mimosa pudica It has been concluded that loss of turgor pressure within the leaves of Mimosa pudica is responsible for the reaction the plant has when touched. Other factors such as changes in osmotic pressure, protoplasmic contraction and increase in cellular permeability have been observed to affect this response. It has also been recorded that turgor pressure is different in the upper and lower pulvinar cells of the plant, and the movement of potassium and calcium ions throughout the cells cause the increase in turgor pressure. When touched, the pulvinus is activated and exudes contractile proteins, which in turn increases turgor pressure and closes the leaves of the plant.  Function in other taxa  As earlier stated, turgor pressure can be found in other organisms besides plants and can play a large role in the development, movement, and nature of said organisms.  Fungi  Shaggy ink caps bursting through asphalt due to high turgor pressure In fungi, turgor pressure has been observed as a large factor in substrate penetration. In species such as Saprolegnia ferax, Magnaporthe grisea and Aspergillus oryzae, immense turgor pressures have been observed in their hyphae. The study showed that they could penetrate substances like plant cells, and synthetic materials such as polyvinyl chloride. In observations of this phenomenon, it is noted that invasive hyphal growth is due to turgor pressure, along with the coenzymes secreted by the fungi to invade said substrates. Hyphal growth is directly related to turgor pressure, and growth slows as turgor pressure decreases. In Magnaporthe grisea, pressures of up to 8 MPa have been observed.  Protists  Some protists do not have cell walls and cannot experience turgor pressure. These few protists are ones that use their contractile vacuole to regulate the quantity of water within the cell. Protist cells avoid lysing in solutions by utilizing a vacuole which pumps water out of the cells to maintain osmotic equilibrium.  Animals  Turgor pressure is observed in animal cells because they lack a cell wall. In organisms with cell walls, the cell wall prevents the cell from lysing from high-pressure values.  Diatoms  In Diatoms, the Heterokontophyta have polyphyletic turgor-resistant cell walls. Throughout these organisms' life cycle, carefully controlled turgor pressure is responsible for cell expansion and for the release of sperm, but not for things such as seta growth.  Cyanobacteria  Gas-vaculate cyanobacterium are the ones generally responsible for water-blooms. They have the ability to float due to the accumulation of gases within their vacuole, and the role of turgor pressure and its effect on the capacity of these vacuoles has been observed in varying scientific papers. It is noted that the higher the turgor pressure, the lower the capacity of the gas-vacuoles in different cyanobacterium. Experiments used to correlate osmosis and turgor pressure in prokaryotes have been used to show how diffusion of solutes into the cell have a play on turgor pressure within the cell.  Measurements  When measuring turgor pressure in plants, many things have to be taken into account. It is generally stated that fully turgid cells have a turgor pressure value which is equal to that of the cell and that flaccid cells have a value at or near zero. Other cellular mechanisms taken into consideration include the protoplast, solutes within the protoplast (solute potential), transpiration rates of the plant and the tension of cell walls. Measurement is limited depending on the method used, some of which are explored and explained below. Not all methods can be used for all organisms, due to size and other properties. For example, a diatom doesn't have the same properties as a plant, which would place constrictions on what could be used to infer turgor pressure.  Units  Units used to measure turgor pressure are independent from the measures used to infer its values. Common units include bars, MPa, or newtons per square meter. 1 bar is equal to .1 MPa.  Methods  Water potential equation = Turgor pressure can be deduced when total water potential, Ψw, and osmotic potential, Ψs, are known in a water potential equation. These equations are used to measure the total water potential of a plant by using variables such as matric potential, osmotic potential, pressure potential, gravitational effects and turgor pressure. After taking the difference between Ψs and Ψw, the value for turgor pressure is given. When using this method, gravity and matric potential are considered to be negligible, since their values are generally either negative or close to zero. = Pressure-bomb technique = Diagram of a pressure bomb The pressure bomb technique was developed by Scholander et al., reviewed by Tyree and Hammel in their 1972 publication, in order to test water movement through plants. The instrument is used to measure turgor pressure by placing a leaf (with stem attached) into a closed chamber where pressurized gas is added in increments. Measurements are taken when xylem sap appears out of the cut surface and at the point which it doesn't accumulate or retreat back into the cut surface. = Atomic force microscope = Atomic force microscopes use a type of scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Small probes are introduced to the area of interest, and a spring within the probe measures values via displacement. This method can be used to measure turgor pressure of organisms. When using this method, supplemental information such as continuum mechanic equations, single force depth curves and cell geometries can be used to quantify turgor pressures within a given area (usually a cell). = Pressure probe = This machine was originally used to measure individual algal cells, but can now be used on larger-celled specimens. It is usually used on higher plant tissues but wasn't used to measure turgor pressure until Hüsken and Zimmerman improved on the method. Pressure probes measure turgor pressure via displacement. A glass micro-capillary tube is inserted into the cell and whatever the cell exudes into the tube is observed through a microscope. An attached device then measures how much pressure is required to push the emission back into the cell.  Micro-manipulation probe  These are used to accurately quantify measurements of smaller cells. In an experiment by Weber, Smith and colleagues, single tomato cells were compressed between a micro-manipulation probe and glass to allow the pressure probe's micro-capillary to find the cell's turgor pressure.  Theoretical speculations = Negative turgor pressure  It has been observed that the value of Ψw decreases as the cell becomes more dehydrated, but scientists have speculated whether this value will continue to decrease but never fall to zero, or if the value can be less than zero. There have been studies which show that negative cell pressures can exist in xerophytic plants, but a paper by M. T. Tyree explores whether this is possible, or a conclusion based on misinterpreted data. In his paper, he concludes that by miscategorizing \\"bound\\" and \\"free\\" water in a cell, researchers that claimed to have found negative turgor pressure values were incorrect. By analyzing the isotherms of apoplastic and symplastic water, he shows that negative turgor pressures cannot be present within arid plants due to net water loss of the specimen during droughts. Despite his analysis and interpretation of data, negative turgor pressure values are still used within the scientific community.  Tip growth in higher plants  A hypothesis formed by M. Harold and his colleagues suggests that tip growth in higher plans is amoebic in nature, and isn't caused by turgor pressure as is widely believed, meaning that extension is caused by the actin cytoskeleton in these plant cells. Regulation of cell growth is implied to be caused by cytoplasmic micro-tubules which control the orientation of cellulose fibrils, which are deposited into the adjacent cell wall and results in growth. In plants, the cells are surrounded by cell walls and filamentous proteins which retain and adjust the plant cell's growth and shape. As explained in the paper, lower plants grow through apical growth, which differs since the cell wall only expands on one end of the cell.

Based on the earliest European depiction of the execution. The execution of Charles I by beheading occurred on Tuesday 30 January 1649 outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall. The execution was the culmination of political and military conflicts between the royalists and the parliamentarians in England during the English Civil War, leading to the capture and trial of Charles I. On Saturday 27 January 1649, the parliamentarian High Court of Justice had declared Charles guilty of attempting to \\"uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the people\\" and he was sentenced to death. Charles spent his last few days in St James's Palace, accompanied by his most loyal subjects and visited by his children. On 30 January, he was taken to a large black scaffold constructed in front of the Banqueting House, where he was to be executed. A large crowd had gathered to witness the regicide. Charles stepped onto the scaffold and gave his last speech - declaring his innocence of the crimes of which parliament had accused him, and claiming himself as a \\"martyr of the people\\". The crowd could not hear the speech, owing to the many parliamentarian guards blocking the scaffold, but Charles' companion, William Juxon, recorded it in shorthand. Charles gave a few last words to Juxon, claiming his \\"incorruptible crown\\" in Heaven, and put his head on the block. He waited a few moments and gave a signal; the anonymous executioner beheaded Charles in one clean blow and held Charles' head up to the crowd silently, dropping it into the swarm of soldiers soon after. The execution has been described as one of the most significant and controversial events in English history. Some view it as the martyrdom of an innocent man, with Restoration historian Edward Hyde describing \\"a year of reproach and infamy above all years which had passed before it; a year of the highest dissimulation and hypocrisy, of the deepest villainy and most bloody treasons that any nation was ever cursed with\\" and the Tory Isaac D'Israeli writing of Charles as \\"having received the axe with the same collectedness of thought and died with the majesty with which he had lived\\", dying a \\"civil and political\\" martyr to Britain. Still others view it as a vital step towards democracy in Britain, with the prosecutor of Charles I, John Cook, declaring that it \\"pronounced sentence not only against one tyrant but against tyranny itself\\"Quoted in ; and Whig historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner, who wrote that \\"with Charles' death the main obstacle to the establishment of a constitutional system had been removed. [...] The monarchy, as Charles understood it, had disappeared forever\\". Execution A Lively Representation of the Manner how his late Majesty was Beheaded upon the Scaffold, a Restoration print of Charles making his speech upon the scaffold. The execution was set to be carried out on 30 January 1649. On 28 January the king was moved to St James's Palace, likely to avoid the noise of the scaffold being set up outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall. Charles spent the day praying with the Bishop of London, William Juxon. On 29 January, Charles burnt his personal papers and ciphered correspondence.; He had not seen his children for 15 months, so the parliamentarians allowed him to talk to his two youngest children, Elizabeth and Henry, for one last time.; ; He instructed the 14-year-old Elizabeth to be faithful to \\"true Protestant religion\\" and to tell her mother that \\"his thoughts had never strayed from her\\".; ; He instructed the 10-year-old Henry to \\"not be made a king\\" by the Parliamentarians, being that many suspected they would install Henry as a puppet king.; ; Charles divided his jewels among the children, leaving him with only his George (an enameled figure of St. George, worn as a part of the ceremonial dress of the Order of the Garter). Charles spent his last night restless, only going to sleep at 2 am. Charles awoke early on the day of his execution. He began dressing at 5 am in fine clothes, all black, and a blue sash. His preparation lasted until dawn. He instructed the Gentleman of his Bedchamber, Thomas Herbert, on what would be done with the few possessions he had left.; He requested one extra shirt from Herbert, so that the crowd gathered would not see him shiver from the cold and mistake it for cowardice.; Before leaving, Juxon gave Charles the Blessed Sacrament, so that Charles would not faint out of hunger on the scaffold. At 10 am, the Colonel Francis Hacker instructed Charles to go to Whitehall, ready for his execution. A large crowd had amassed outside the Banqueting House, where the platform for Charles' execution was set up. The platform was draped in black and staples had been driven into the wood for ropes to be run through if Charles needed to be restrained.; ; ; ; The execution block was so low that the king would have had to prostrate himself to place his head on the block, a submissive pose as compared to kneeling before the block.; The executioners of Charles were hidden behind face masks and wigs to prevent identification.; ; ; Just before 2 pm, Colonel Hacker called Charles to the scaffold.; ; Charles came through the window of the Banqueting Hall to the scaffold in what Herbert described as \\"the saddest sight England ever saw\\".; Charles saw the crowd and realised that the barrier of guards prevented the crowd from hearing any speech he would make so he addressed his speech to Juxon and the regicide Matthew Thomlinson - the former of whom recorded the speech in shorthand. He declared his innocence from the crimes parliament accused him of, his faithfulness to Christianity and that Parliament had been the cause of all the wars before him. He called himself \\"a martyr of the people\\" - claiming he would be killed for their rights.; ; ; ; ; ; Charles asked Juxon for his silk nightcap to put on, so that the executioner would not be troubled by his hair.; He turned to Juxon and declared he \\"would go from a corruptible crown to an incorruptible crown\\" \\\\- claiming his perceived righteous place in Heaven.; ; Charles gave his loyal gentleman, Juxon, his George, sash and cloak - uttering one cryptic word: \\"remember\\".; ; ; ; Charles laid his neck out on the block and asked the executioner to wait for his signal to behead him. A moment passed and Charles gave the signal; the executioner beheaded him in one clean blow.; ; ; The executioner silently held up Charles' head to the spectators. He did not utter the customary cry of \\"Behold the head of a traitor!\\" either from inexperience or fear of identification. According to the royalist Philip Henry, the crowd let out a loud groan; ; \\\\- a 17 year old Henry writing of \\"such a groan [...] as I never heard before and I desire I may never hear again\\" \\\\- though such a groan is not reported by any other contemporary account of the execution. The executioner dropped the king's head into the crowd and the soldiers swarmed around it, dipping their handkerchiefs in his blood and cutting off locks of his hair.; ; Executioner of Charles I The title page of The Confession of Richard Brandon, a 1649 pamphlet claiming to reveal Richard Brandon as Charles I's executioner. The identities of the executioner of Charles I and his assistant were never revealed to the public, with crude face masks and wigs hiding them at the execution,; and they were probably only known to Oliver Cromwell and a few of his colleagues. The clean cut on Charles' head and the fact the executioner held up Charles' head after the execution suggests the executioner was experienced in the use of an axe, though the fact the executioner did not call out \\"Behold the head of a traitor!\\" could suggest that he was inexperienced in the public execution of traitors, or that he simply feared identification from his voice. There was much speculation among the public on the identity of the executioner, with several contradictory identifications appearing in the popular press.; These included Richard Brandon, William Hulet, William Walker, Hugh Peters, George Joyce, John Bigg, Gregory Brandon and even - as one French report alleged - Cromwell and Fairfax themselves.; ; Though many of these proved to be unfounded rumours (the accusations of Gregory Brandon, Cromwell and Fairfax were entirely ahistorical), some may have been accurate. Colonel John Hewson was given the task of finding an executioner and he offered 40 soldiers the position of executioner or assistant in exchange for £100 and quick promotion, though none came forward immediately.; It has been suggested that one of these soldiers later accepted the job, the most likely being William Hulet. Shortly after the execution Hulet received a prominent and swift promotion and he was not seen to be present on the day of Charles' execution. His alibi consisted of the claim he was imprisoned on the day for refusing the position, though this seems to conflict with his promotion soon after. William Hulet was tried as the executioner in October 1660, upon the Restoration, and he was sentenced to death for his supposed part in the execution. This sentence was soon overturned and Hulet was pardoned after some exculpatory evidence was presented to the judge. The most likely candidate for the executioner was Richard Brandon, the common hangman at the time of Charles' execution. He would have been experienced, explaining the clean cut, and he is reported to have received £30 around the time of the execution. He was also the executioner of other royalists before, and after, Charles' execution - including William Laud and Lord Capel. Despite this, Brandon denied being the executioner throughout his life, and a contemporary letter claims that he refused a parliamentarian offer of £200 to perform the execution. A tract published shortly after Brandon's death, The Confession of Richard Brandon, claims to contain a deathbed confession of Brandon to the execution of Charles, though it is regarded as a forgery and attracted little attention in its time.; ; Of the other suggested candidates: Hugh Peters had prominently advocated for Charles' death but was absent at his execution, though he was reported to have been kept at home through illness. George Joyce was a loyal fanatic of Cromwell and had, earlier in the war, captured the king from Holdenby House. William Walker was a parliamentarian soldier who, according to local tradition, had confessed to the regicide several times. John Bigg was a clerk of the regicide Simon Mayne and later hermit who, according to local tradition, became a hermit shortly after the Restoration out of fear for being tried as the executioner. Reaction=In Britain On his execution day, the reports of Charles' last actions were fitting for his later portrayal as a martyr; ; ; \\\\- as biographer Geoffrey Robertson put it, he \\"played the martyr's part almost to perfection\\".; This was certainly no accident, a flurry of royalist reports overstated the horror of the crowd and the biblical innocence of Charles in his execution.; Even Charles showed planning for his future martyrdom: apparently delighted that the biblical passage to be read upon the day of his execution was Matthew's account of the Crucifixion. He had hinted to his cousin, the Duke of Hamilton, in 1642: In the opinion of Daniel P. Klein: \\"Charles was a defeated and humiliated king in 1649. Yet by tying his trial to Christ's, the King was able to lay claim to martyrdom, connecting his defeated political cause with religious truth\\" Almost immediately after Charles was executed, the supposed meditations and autobiography of Charles, Eikon Basilike, began to circulate in England. The book gained massive popularity in a short time, going into twenty editions by the first month of its publication, and has been named by Philip A. Knachel \\"the most widely read, widely discussed work of royalist propaganda to issue from the English Civil War\\". The book presented Charles' supposed meditations on the events of his kingship and his justifications for his past actions, widely disseminating the view of Charles as the pious \\"martyr of the people\\" he had declared himself. It aggravated the fervor of the royalists in the wake of Charles' execution and their high praise led to the wide circulation of the book; some sections even put into verse and music for the uneducated and illiterate of the population.; ; John Milton described it as \\"the chiefe strength and nerves of their [royalist] cause\\". On the other side, the parliamentarians led their own propaganda war against these royalists reports. They suppressed royalist works like the Eikon Basilike and the other various elegies to the deceased king by arresting and suppressing the printers of such books. Simultaneously, they worked with radical booksellers and publishers to push pro-regicide works, outprinting their opponents by two to one in the month of February, following Charles' execution. Even commissioning Milton to publish Eikonoklastes as a parliamentarian rejoinder to Eikon Basilike—sharply mocking the piety of Eikon Basilike and the \\"image-doting rabble\\" who latched on to its depiction of Charles—attacking its royalist arguments in a chapter-by- chapter fashion.; Charles's prosecutor, John Cook, published a pamphlet defending the execution of Charles, giving \\"an appeal to all rational men concerning his tryal at the High Court of Justice\\", in which he asserted that the execution had \\"pronounced sentence not only against one tyrant but against tyranny itself\\". These publications had such an effect on the public perception that—despite the regicide going against nearly every conception of social order in the period—the regicides of Charles felt safe in their positions soon after. A contemporary source described Cromwell and Ireton as \\"very cheerfull & well pleased\\" at the events by 24 February.Quoted in In Europe Anonymous Dutch painting of the execution of Charles I, 1649. While depictions of the execution were suppressed in England, European depictions like this were produced, emphasizing the shock of the crowd with fainting women and bloodied streets. The reaction among European statesmen was almost universally negative, with the princes and rulers of Europe quick to voice their horror at the regicide.; Despite this, very little action was taken against the new English government, as foreign governments carefully avoided cutting off relations with England over their condemnations of the execution. Even the allies of the royalists in the Vatican, France and the Netherlands avoided straining relationships with the parliamentarians in England; the official statement of sympathy to Charles II from the Dutch went as far as possible to avoid calling him \\"your majesty\\". Most European nations had their own troubles occupying their minds, such as negotiating the terms of the recently signed Peace of Westphalia, and the regicide was treated with what Richard Bonney described as a \\"half-hearted irrelevance\\". As C. V. Wedgwood put it, the general conduct of the statesmen of Europe was to \\"pay lip-service alone to the idea of avenging the outrage [of the execution], and to govern their conduct towards its perpetrators by purely practical considerations\\". Legacy The Apotheosis, or, Death of the King, a 1728 engraving depicting Charles I ascending to heaven after his execution. The image of Charles' execution became vital to the cult of St. Charles the Martyr in English royalism. Shortly after Charles' death, relics of Charles' execution were reported to perform miracles - with handkerchiefs of Charles' blood supposedly curing the King's Evil among peasants.; ; Many elegies and works of devotion were produced to glorify the dead Charles and his cause.; After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, this private devotion was transformed into official worship; in 1661, the Church of England declared 30 January a solemn fast for the martyrdom of Charles and Charles occupied a saint-like status in contemporary prayer books.; ; ; ; In Charles II's reign, (as estimated by Francis Turner) around 3000 sermons were given annually to commemorate the martyrdom of Charles.; Restoration historiography of the Civil War emphasised the regicide as a grand and theatrical tragedy, depicting the last days of Charles' life in a hagiographical fashion. Britain's Lord Chancellor after the Restoration, Edward Hyde, in his monumental History of the Rebellion (1702–04), concluded his account the year of Charles' execution passionately condemning: After the Glorious Revolution, even as royalism declined, the cult continued to enjoy support; the anniversaries of Charles' execution created an annual \\"general madding-day\\" of Royal support—as Whig Edmund Ludlow put it—up until the 18th-century.; Early Whig historians such as James Wellwood and Roger Coke, even as they criticised and mocked the Stuarts, were hesitant to criticise Charles and quick to condemn the execution as an abomination. The memory of Charles' execution remained uncomfortable for many Whigs in Britain. To delegitimise this cult, later Whigs spread the view of Charles as a tyrant, and his execution as a step towards constitutional government in Britain. In opposition, British Tory literary and political figures, including Isaac D'Israeli and Walter Scott, attempted to rejuvenate the cult with romanticised tales of Charles' execution−emphasising the same tropes of martyrdom the royalists had done before them. D'Israeli narrated the execution of Charles I in his Commentaries on the Life and Reign of Charles the First (1828), in which Charles dies \\"having received the axe with the same collectedness of thought and died with the majesty with which he had lived\\". For D'Israeli, \\"the martyrdom of Charles was a civil and political one\\", which \\"seems an expiation of the errors and infirmities of the early years of his reign.\\" However, by the Victorian era, the view of the Whig historians had prevailed in British historiography and the public consciousness.; The observance of 30 January as the \\"martyrdom\\" of Charles was officially removed from the services of the Church of England with the Anniversary Days Observance Act 1859, and the number of sermons given upon the death of Charles I of dwindled. This Whig view was exemplified by the Victorian historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner as he closed his late 19th-century History of the Great Civil War: Charles I's life and his execution has often been a subject of popular representations in the modern day. Popular historians, such as Samuel Rawson Gardiner, Veronica Wedgwood and J.G. Muddiman, have retold the tale of Charles I's decline and fall, through his trial and to his execution, in narrative histories. Films and television have exploited the dramatic tension and shock of the execution for many purposes: from comedy as in Blackadder: The Cavalier Years, to period drama as in To Kill a King. The subject of the execution, though, has suffered from a notable lack of serious scholarship throughout the modern era; perhaps partly out of what Jason Peacey, a leading figure in the scholarship of Charles I's execution, has called a discomfort at \\"such a thoroughly ‘un-English’ project as removing the head of their monarch\\". This stigma has slowly been lifted, as academic interest has risen into the late 20th century; eliciting much interest in 1999, upon the 350th anniversary of the trial and execution of Charles I.; See also * Regicide * Execution of Louis XVI * Execution of the Romanov family * King Charles the Martyr * Fifth Monarchists * Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers * Calves' Head Club References=NotesCitations=Sources=Books   * * Articles       Category:1649 in politics Category:1649 in England Category:English Civil War Charles I Category:Charles I of England Category:17th century in London Category:Whitehall Category:Public executions ","title":"Execution of Charles I"},{"id":"4414127","text":"Shops on the older, south side of the Headrow A section of the Ordnance Survey map of central Leeds of before and after the Headrow's creation, highlighting its route The Headrow is an avenue in Leeds city centre, West Yorkshire, England. It is one of the most important thoroughfares in central Leeds, hosting many of the city's civic and cultural buildings including Leeds Town Hall, Leeds Central Library, Leeds Art Gallery, The Henry Moore Institute and The Light. Some of the largest retail floorplates in the city are on The Headrow, particularly between Park Row and Briggate, where major chains have opened flagship stores. The Headrow is part of a longer axis that includes Westgate, Eastgate and Quarry Hill. The Headrow forms a spine across the city centre between Westgate and Eastgate and is approximately ½ mile (700 m) long. It was widened between 1928 and 1932 in a redevelopment designed by architect Reginald Blomfield primarily as a way of improving traffic flow through city centre. The area has an advisory speed limit of . The section between Park Row and Briggate is reserved for buses and taxis and cars/motorcycles are not permitted to use it between 5am and 10pm. History View down Westgate and the Headrow at night Appearing on maps in 1560, the Headrow once formed the northern edge or \\"head\\" of medieval Leeds' boundary, hence its name. To the east the street crossed Sheepscar Beck, a tributary of the River Aire now culverted, and continued, known as \\"The Street\\", to York. In the 17th century it was renamed Parke Lane, Burley Bar, Upper Head Row and Lower Head Row. Renamed again in the 19th century, at the junction with Albion Street the street ran to the east as Upperhead Row and Lowerhead Row and to the west as Park Lane and Guildford Street - once home to St Anne's Cathedral which was demolished in November 1904 and relocated to Cookridge Street. More recently, running east-to-west, the street became Eastgate, the Headrow and Westgate, though portions of Park Lane remain at the far end of Westgate. Developments included the construction of Permanent House, the headquarters of the Leeds Permanent Building Society, Lewis's department store and the Odeon Cinema which opened as the Paramount Theatre. Headrow House was constructed in the 1950s. The redevelopment is designed in a uniform neo-baroque style similar to Regent Street in London also designed by Reginald Blomfield. The buildings are clad in red brick and Portland stone as opposed to Portland stone only on Regent Street. The development of the Headrow as a road-widening scheme meant that the north side was constructed in the uniform style while the south side has a mixture of buildings from the 1800s to the present. The Odeon, which was the last picture palace in the city centre, closed due to competition with local multiplexes and the impending opening of a thirteen screen multiplex at The Light retail and leisure complex originally operated by Ster Century and now Vue, it closed in 2001. The building which was originally to be converted to an apartment & leisure complex but was almost immediately bought by Primark who converted it into a large three storey clothes store that opened in August 2005. Primark vacated the building in March 2015 and in August 2015 the building re-opened as a Sports Direct store. Retail The former Odeon cinema, now Sports Direct Street sign Today the street is one of Leeds's principal shopping streets. The former Permanent House, now known as The Light on the north side, houses a cinema, restaurants and a Radisson BLU Hotel. There is ground floor retail in Direct Line House (originally Headrow House) on Dortmund Square. St John's Shopping Centre and The Headrow Centre flank opposite sides of Dortmund Square, on The Headrow. Broad Gate was built in 1932 and occupied by Lewis's from 1932-1996, it was then occupied by Allders from 1996-2005. After the closure of Allders in 2005, Broad Gate was closed for refurbishment. Since 2008, half of the Broad Gate building has been transformed into offices and the other half has remained open to the public as separate retail units occupied by retailers including Sainsbury's, T.K. Maxx, Argos and Clas Ohlson. In 2016 Clas Ohlson was closed and In 2017 the unit was re-opened by Home Sense. Opposite the former Odeon cinema is Crash Records, which has been a fixture of the Leeds music scene for over 30 years. Attractions The Headrow from Westgate, including Leeds Town Hall The Light houses a 13-screen multiplex cinema operated by Vue and a Virgin Active Gym, Radisson BLU Hotel and restaurants and bars. There are several art galleries on The Headrow axis, including the major Leeds City Art Gallery, Henry Moore Institute and New Briggate gallery. Victoria Gardens At the western end of the Headrow is Victoria Gardens, Leeds' Speakers' Corner, best known as the location of the war memorial, and where justice and anti-war rallies have gathered and terminated. The area is surrounded by Leeds Town Hall, Leeds City Art Gallery, The Henry Moore Institute and Leeds Central Library. The mother church of the Methodist District of Leeds, Oxford Place Methodist Mission, fronts the western side, while The Light shopping centre is on the eastern side. Dortmund Square In 1980, the area between Headrow House and Lewis store was converted to Dortmund Square. To celebrate ten years of twinning the people of Dortmund presented the people of Leeds with a bronze statue, sculpted by Arthur Shulze-Engels, of the Dortmund Drayman which stands in the square.

The subspecies is native to Texas and adjacent Mexico. Geographic range D. m. erebennus is found from southern Texas south into Mexico as far as Veracruz. Description Dorsally, the Texas indigo snake is predominantly black in color, with a high sheen which gives its smooth scales a remarkable iridescent hue. The underside is often a salmon pink color. It is a large snake, regularly attaining a total length (including tail) beyond . Specimens long are not unheard of. Habitat The Texas indigo snake prefers lightly vegetated areas not far from permanent water sources, but is also found in mesquite savannah, open grassland areas, and coastal sand dunes. It dens in burrows left by other animals. Behavior and diet D. m. erebennus is diurnal, and spend most of its time actively hiding. It will consume almost anything it can overpower and swallow, including mammals, birds, lizards, frogs, turtles, eggs, and even other snakes, including rattlesnakes. Because of its aggressive attacks on rattlesnakes, many farmers in southern Texas consider it a useful ally. Hence the adage, \\"If it's an indigo, let it go.\\" It is not a typically aggressive snake, but may bite or release a foul smelling musk from its cloaca if handled or harassed. Like many colubrid snakes, it will often shake its tail as a warning – even though it does not possess a rattle. Reproduction Breeding of D. m. erebennus takes place, generally yearly, in the winter. Clutches that average 10-12 eggs are laid in the spring, and hatch around 80 days later. Hatchlings can be up to long. Maturity is reached in 2–3 years. Conservation The Texas indigo snake is listed as a threatened species by the state of Texas.http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Drymarchon+melanurus+erebennus Retrieved 11/12/12 Its primary threat is from habitat loss due to human development. Each snake requires a large home range to forage, and urban sprawl is shrinking its usable habitat. Roads bisect its territory, and many snakes each year are run over by cars.

Shanks is famous for his calculation of π to 707 places, accomplished in 1873, which, however, was only correct up to the first 527 places. This error was highlighted in 1944 by D. F. Ferguson (using a mechanical desk calculator). Shanks earned his living by owning a boarding school at Houghton-le-Spring, which left him enough time to spend on his hobby of calculating mathematical constants. His routine was as follows: he would calculate new digits all morning; and then he would spend all afternoon checking his morning's work. To calculate π, Shanks used Machin's formula: : \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} = 4 \\\\arctan \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\right) - \\\\arctan \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{239} \\\\right) Shanks's approximation was the longest expansion of π until the advent of the digital electronic computer about one century later. Shanks also calculated e and the Euler–Mascheroni constant γ to many decimal places. He published a table of primes up to 60 000 and found the natural logarithms of 2, 3, 5 and 10 to 137 places.

Gypsy punk is a hybrid musical genre that crosses traditional Romani music with punk rock. One of the first rock groups to incorporate elements of punk and Gypsy music was Motherhead Bug, which was active mostly in the early 1990s. A broader audience became aware of the genre after the band Gogol Bordello released the album Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike, with front man Eugene Hütz describing their performance as a \\"Gypsy Punk Cabaret\\". Gypsy punk bands usually combine rock beats and instrumentation with more traditional Gypsy instrumentation such as drums, tambourine, accordion, fiddle, trumpet and saxophone.Ben Sisario, \\"The Rise of Gypsy Punkers\\" , The New York Times, 2 July 2005 History The origin of the term \\"gypsy punk\\" may be disputable, but it is agreed that the Romani culture is how the style of it began. The Romani people, who are spread out throughout the world, have affected the music industry in the west as seen through bands such as Gogol Bordello. Eastern European and traditional instrumentation and multilingual lyrics are both common characteristics of Romani music. In the case of Gogol Bordello, the upbeat tempo and “punk scream-singing”Hajdu, David. “TRIUMPH OF THE GYPSIES.” New Republic 241, no. 7 (May 13, 2010): 27–30. along with these common “gypsy” characteristics create a concrete example of what is known as gypsy punk. “The word “gypsy” coupled with the term “punk” has interesting implications in that punk encapsulates a particular mode of rebellion, anarchy, and resistance in a Western context”Jablonsky, Rebecca. “Russian Jews and ‘Gypsy Punks’: The Performance of Real and Imagined Cultural Identities Within a Transnational Migrant Group.” Journal of Popular Music Studies 24, no. 1 (2012): 3–24. which is good to note since at the time Gogol Bordello and other bands were introducing this genre, “the punk movement became identified in mass culture as the definitive statement of the annihilation of musical and societal norms, collectively rejecting the rules of the past because of the bleak and hypocritical present and future they provided”. This is to say that the Roma that have settled down in the west have taken elements from “Romani music in a style that is indebted to Western punk” Because gypsy punk is a mixture of traditional music and popular music to the western culture, the Romani are colonizing and seemingly settling into a loose identity of their own. The music itself “is considered to be a post-colonial movement”. Philosophy Since their migrations from their original homeland in India, the Romani have been so spread out that they “lack a homeland”. Gypsy punk is not just full of Romani culture, but also the lack thereof. For the Romani, music has been identified as a “primary form of cultural expression” The Romani, through their ties with the western punk influence, have created music that allows those who play to express themselves and forge an identity. Gypsy punk is not only utilized and performed by people of the Romani, or “gypsy”, culture. Punk encapsulates “rebellion, anarchy, and resistance”. These thoughts are transferred then to the hybrid genre of “Gypsy Punk”. This insinuates that gypsy performances and the music itself promotes a freedom for those who participate in the genre. It’s a romanticized version of the lives of an actual “gypsy”. Instead of being “Russian”, “Jewish”, “Eastern European”, etc. they can “articulate their identities, while joining in the performance of being a wild and wandering gypsy”. By making the actual gypsy culture seem like something it is not, “it does not consider the authenticity of Roma representation but rather replicates an idealized and dreamed-up version of what being a gypsy means.

Shinchosha) is a Japanese novel by Osamu Dazai. It was published in 1947 and is set in Japan after World War II. Principal characters are Kazuko, her brother Naoji, and their elderly mother. The story shows a family in decline and crisis, like many other families during this period of transition between traditional Japan and a more advanced, industrial society. Many families needed to leave their old lives behind and start anew. Throughout the story, mostly through the character Naoji, the author brings up a number of social and philosophical problems of that time period. The novel was adapted into a film, also called The Setting Sun, which was released by Kaerucafe on June 13, 2009. Directed by Masatoshi Akihara and with a screenplay by Yukie Ochiai, the film starred Eriko Sato as Kazuko. Other cast members included Yōichi Nukumizu, Yosuke Ito, Sera Rinka, Kota Masago, Ichiro Ogura, and Hitomi Takahashi as the mother. The novel has been translated into English by Donald Keene. As of January 1, 2019, the book is in the public domain. Plot summary After World War II, a small aristocratic family in Japan has lost all of their money. The family consists of three people: Kazuko, her brother Naoji, and their mother. Naoji is a soldier in the South Pacific and is absent throughout much of the beginning of the novel. Kazuko was married once before, but she divorced. In the family's old house, Kazuko's mother eats rationed food. Kazuko recalls a time when she tried to burn snake eggs, thinking that they were viper eggs. It is revealed that at the time of Kazuko's father's death, there were many snakes present. Therefore, snakes have become ominous in her mother's eyes. After recalling the time Kazuko burned the eggs, she reveals that she feels a snake is growing inside of her own chest. The family eventually moves to the countryside. Kazuko begins working in the fields. She claims to be growing into a \\"coarse woman\\". Naoji eventually returns. He is addicted to opium and treats his mother and sister cruelly. He also goes out every night drinking. Kazuko finds Naoji's \\"Moonflower Journal,\\" which he wrote when he had narcotic poisoning. It consists of pages upon pages of unconnected gripes about the world, and how people always lie. Kazuko falls for a novelist named Mr. Uehara. She writes three letters to him, claiming to love a man named M.C., while addressing the letter to him with two combinations of M.C. after his name. “My Chekhov” and “My Child” indicate that he was in fact the one she is referring to in the letters. He does not respond. Soon after, her mother is diagnosed with tuberculosis. Kazuko sees a black snake on the porch and remembers how her father died when one was present. She yells at it, claiming to have already felt its vengeance. It does not retreat. Her mother eventually dies. After an outing with Mr. Uehara six years after she met him, Kazuko realizes that he also is not in the best health and calls him a victim. That morning, Kazuko finds out that Naoji has committed suicide. His suicide note reveals his reasons for not wanting to live anymore. Naoji believed that humans have the right to choose whether they want to live or die. He confesses his weakness and anguish out of his birth in noble class. But he protests the idea \\"all man is same\\", insisting that Marxism affirms the priority of workers, and democracy that of personal dignity. He also tells Kazuko about a woman once loved, but had difficulty writing her name. He finally reveals that her name is Suga. His last request is that he be buried in his mother's hemp kimono, something he had wanted to wear the next summer. In the last chapter, Kazuko claims that people keep leaving her. The story ends with a letter to Mr. Uehara. She reveals that she is pregnant, and that she will happily raise the child on her own. She has thrown away the old morality and is embracing a new revolutionary way of life, like Rosa Luxemburg and Jesus coming to bring a sword in Matthew 10 that she has read, very much like what all of Japan was undergoing. She says that they are \\"victims of a transitional period\\", and ends the letter addressing Mr. Uehara once again as M.C., this time \\"My Comedian\\". Characters * Kazuko – Daughter of an aristocratic family that loses all of their money, likely that in The Cherry Orchard, after World War II. She used to be married but divorced after an affair with another man. She moves with her mother to the countryside and takes care of her. * Kazuko’s mother – elderly, sickly woman who becomes lost and depressed after losing all of her money and having to leave her old life behind. She eventually dies of tuberculosis. * Naoji – a soldier in the war, was addicted to narcotics and opium. Has a very negative view of the world, especially on the nobility class and hypocrisy as evident in his “Moonflower Journal”. Eventually commits suicide. * Mr. Uehara – a novelist who is married with a child. Kazuko is in love with him, and he claims to love her back but never responds to any letters Kazuko sends him. * Uncle Wada – Kazuko’s uncle. He financially supports Kazuko’s family for a time until he is unable to do so anymore. Symbolism The Setting Sun refers to how Japan, the \\"Land of the Rising Sun\\" was in a period of decline after World War II. In her last letter to Mr. Uehara, Kazuko says that Japan is struggling against the old morality, \\"like the sun\\". The black snake can be seen as a symbol of death. There was a snake present when her father died, and also a snake present when her mother died. Also, at their old house, there was a snake present, symbolizing the death of her family’s old life and the coming death of her mother. Fire is a motif which appears throughout the novel, and it symbolizes many different things. When Kazuko unintentionally cause the fire right after she moves into the countryside, the fire represents the downfall of Kazuko's family, and that of Japanese aristocracy as a whole. Later, when Kazuko describes her feelings as \\"a bridge of flames\\" in her letter to Mr. Uehara, the symbol now represents Kazuko's strong, almost desperate, dependency on him.

History  Diffusion indexes were originally designed to help identify business cycle turning points.Getz and Ulmer, p. 14, footnote 2 citing Geoffrey Moore, 1950, \\"Occasional Paper 31,\\" Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research.  Example  A diffusion index of monthly employment levels across industries measures the degree to which a growth in employment levels in a population is made up of growth in all industries versus sharp growth in just a few industries. In one published data series on that design, the diffusion index is computed from a panel of discrete time series by assigning a value of 0 to an observation if it is lower than its analog in the previous month, 50 if it is at the same level, and 100 if it has increased. The average of these component values for a given period over the time period is a diffusion index. Relative to the equation above, the underlying factors f_t are drawn from the values {0, 50, 100} based on employment changes, and the diffusion index X_{t} works out to be the percentage of these employment counts that increased in the previous month. Some researchers have reported that a diffusion index of monthly manufacturing-sector employment is a leading indicator of turning points in the business cycle.Getz and Ulmer, pp 13-22.

It was an updated version of Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, which was previously known in the Florida park as Tropical Serenade, that featured the bird characters Iago and Zazu from the respective Walt Disney Animation Studios franchises Aladdin and The Lion King. The ride ran for almost thirteen years from April 1998 until January 2011, when a small fire damaged the attraction, leading Disney to bring back the original Enchanted Tiki Room to Florida. History The Enchanted Tiki Room show from Disneyland opened in the Magic Kingdom on October 1, 1971, as Tropical Serenade. The show was an exact duplicate of the Disneyland attraction, but instead of the pre-show there was a waterfall in place of the Tiki gods, which opened and two Audio-Animatronic toucans entertained guests. The show was sponsored by Florida Citrus Growers until 1986. The show closed on September 1, 1997 for renovations and updating, re-opening on April 5, 1998 as The Enchanted Tiki Room: Under New Management, featuring Iago (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried) and Zazu (voiced by Michael Gough) from Aladdin and The Lion King, respectively, as the new owners of the Tiki Room. The show featured all of the same audio-animatronic birds, flowers and Tiki gods but now included Iago and Zazu, plus a new evil Tiki goddess named Uh-Oa, who disrupted the usual Enchanted Tiki Room storyline after Iago upset her, in total the show used 225 Audio-Animatronics. On January 12, 2011, a small fire broke out in the attic of the attraction. It is rumored that the Iago figure (that first interrupts the show) was severely damaged by the small blaze, but the cause of the fire and extent of damage was kept quiet under an investigation. Other show elements experienced minor damage when the sprinkler system went off to extinguish the flames. No guests were injured in the incident. The original attraction re-opened on August 15, 2011, as \\"Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room\\", an edited and trimmed version of the original show, featuring all but one of the songs from the original 1963 version of the show. Storyline As guests were waiting outside the Enchanted Tiki Room, a cylinder-shaped tube opened behind a waterfall to reveal two audio-animatronic toucans — William (voiced by Don Rickles) and Morris (voiced by Phil Hartman). William and Morris entertained the waiting guests by discussing their positions as agents of the new Tiki Room's new \\"co-owners\\". A cast member then told the birds that he/she was preparing to let the guests in. William and Morris were incensed because their clients were not yet in the theater. Morris said that he had to leave because he was about to sign Donald Duck, while William bragged that he had got the Mighty Ducks. The cylinder closed with the two birds yelling and arguing. After the guests had entered the theater, the cast member proceeded to \\"wake up\\" José with help from the audience. The four Tiki Bird hosts- José, Michael, Pierre and Fritz (voiced by Wally Boag, Fulton Burley, Jerry Orbach and Thurl Ravenscroft, respectively) got ready as they did in the original show. They started singing \\"The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room\\" as they had for the last 30 years, but in the middle of their song, an audio- animatronic Iago, the parrot from Disney's Aladdin, descended from a hole in the ceiling. Iago sat on a pillow holding a small megaphone, yelling that the Tiki Birds needed to stop the music. Iago complained that the show's outdated songs made him want to \\"toss his crackers.\\" The birds said that they were in the middle of a show. From another hole in the ceiling came a perch bearing an audio-animatronic Zazu, the hornbill from Disney's The Lion King. Zazu pleaded with Iago not to toy with the Tiki Room. Pierre told Iago that \\"his friend\\" was right and that he should not anger the Room's inhabitants. Iago ignored Zazu's warnings and replied that Zazu wasn't his friend. José, Michael, Piere and Fritz were confused — they didn't know who Iago and Zazu were because they never \\"flew to the movies\\", considering that they didn't get out much as they were rather \\"attached to the place\\". But Iago warned them not to get \\"too attached\\", as both he and Zazu were the new owners, shocking the birds, and, to give them an example of how the songs should be sung, he began singing a song to the tune of \\"Friend Like Me\\" from Aladdin. He said that since the Tiki Birds were ancient history and he was a big \\"cele-birdy,\\" he was going to change the show so that a more modern audience could appreciate it, warning the birds that they'd better get hip or their audience would disappear forever. Exterior of the attractionZazu told Iago to stop — the Tiki Gods could hear him. Iago then began to blatantly insult the Gods, soon after which \\"lightning\\" struck and the lights went out. The Tiki Birds began singing that the atmosphere in the theater had suddenly gotten \\"Hot Hot Hot\\" and the carved faces on the Tiki Poles began chanting \\"Uh-Oa!\\" From the center of the fountain in the middle of the room, smoke bubbled and fumed and Uh-Oa, the green and evil audio-animatronic \\"Tiki Goddess of Disaster\\" (voiced by Armelia McQueen), emerged. Uh-Oa wanted to know who dared to defame the Tiki Gods and Zazu told her it was Iago. Uh-Oa then sang about how unwise Iago was to have messed with her. She claimed that he \\"could't fly away because [he was] stuck, [she] had cursed [him] for pushing [his] luck and it would't help to yell — [he was] under [her] spell!\\" Uh-Oa then used her magic Tiki powers and Iago shot up from his perch. In a big, dark explosion of smoke, the loud-mouthed parrot was gone. Uh-Oa laughed evilly, then, in a cloud of smoke, disappeared back into the fountain. The Tiki Birds and Zazu felt that they should let the Tiki Gods have their say and Zazu introduced the one and only musical sensation: The Tiki Gods. The faces on the Tiki Poles began to sing \\"In the Still of the Night\\" by The Five Satins, then the flowers joined in by singing a rap song using lyrics from the original Tiki Room show and some of the birds began singing along. At this point, over the exit doors, a small compartment on the wall opened. And who else should be in the compartment but Iago. Iago was burnt, smoking, carrying a crutch and had bandages all over his body. He told them all how the Tiki Gods were the greatest act he had ever heard and that they were going to make a gold mine on this show, no more worries. Zazu told Iago that where he came from, no worries was referred to as \\"Hakuna Matata,\\" which Iago misinterpreted as \\"Hunky-Tuna Tostada\\". However, he seemed to like it, declaring that Zazu was now his friend and that they should party. All the birds started to sing their own rendition of \\"Conga\\" as the Bird Mobile descended from the ceiling. Zazu sang about how Iago learned his lesson and would no doubt be more discreet in the future. Iago decided to show Zazu that he would't be discreet, telling everybody to get on their feet. \\"That's right — everybody stand up!\\" As the audience prepared to leave, the Tiki Birds began singing \\"Get on Your Feet\\" by Gloria Estefan. The birds declared that they were going to do a magic trick and make the audience face the door and disappear. The exit doors opened and the guests started walking out as the Tiki Birds continued to sing \\"Get On Your Feet\\", followed by \\"Heigh-Ho\\". Zazu bid farewell to the guests, while Iago kept up a barrage of comments and insults designed to get the guests to leave as they walked under him. Once the majority of the guests had left the theater, Iago said that he was tired and planned to go take a nap in the Hall of Presidents. He then said good-bye to Zazu, turned around and entered the compartment over the exit. As Fritz cheered in German, José commented that \\"no one laid an egg but me.\\" Reception The refurbishment was negatively received by the public with many calling it \\"disrespectful\\" to the classic attraction. One park goer was quoted saying \\"they ruined it\\". Many found it peculiar that the once calming attraction was replaced with a \\"jarring and cynical\\" take from Iago from Aladdin.

In 2005 guitarist John 5 of Marilyn Manson fame formed Loser. The band was partly co- founded by John 5's friend, producer Bob Marlette. Vocalist Joe Grah already had a significant amount of success in his home state of Texas with the band Jibe. Marlette recommended Grah to John 5, and so he hopped on a plane to Texas to see Jibe play. Grah flew back to Los Angeles and was hired on the spot. Recruiting fellow Texan musicians bassist Charles Lee Salvaggio and drummer Glendon Crain, Loser began working on their debut album Just Like You. The band played its first show in Hollywood, California on June 9, (6-9-05). The name Loser came about as a reaction to John 5's past: When questioned in an interview regarding the band's sound, John 5 replied, \\"It is just great rock music. It is kinda like the Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age, new- age stuff.\\"John 5 bio at Glam-Metal.com. The band had initial success not long after signing with Island Records, when the track \\"Disposable Sunshine\\" was included on the 2005 Fantastic Four soundtrack. During the recording of the soundtrack, however, Crain briefly left the band and was replaced by drummer Elias Andra, a friend of Lee's. Andra had had some success himself with the industrial metal band Psycho Plague, his own creation, which toured as a headline act with Linkin Park. However, Andra soon left after promotional shots had been taken, and Crain returned. Loser was set to release its debut album, Just Like You, on June 18, 2006, on Island/Def Jam Recordings. At the same time, John 5 was also working for Rob Zombie, and a conflict occurred. As Zombie was also touring, John 5 tried to find a live replacement for himself while Loser was touring on conflicting dates. Even with promo material for the debut album out and a release date in the bag, however, Island Record didn't like the idea of Loser without John 5, and so dropped the band from the label. \\"Being the founding member of Loser, my decision to leave was not an easy one\\", said John 5 in a press release. \\"I've been juggling two careers, both with Loser and Rob Zombie, for over one year now. I found it impossible to be in two places at once.\\" Former Marilyn Manson guitarist John 5 leaves Loser to focus on Rob Zombie. Blabbermouth.com The official Loser Myspace page has tracks from Just for You available for download.Myspace Loser. Accessed on Nov. 23, 2007. Since the dissolution of Loser, Joe Grah has formed a band called South of Earth. Charles Lee later went on to play bass in Filter, but left that band due to personal issues. Lee is now the guitarist for Black Sunshine. Andra is now the drummer of bands Julien-K and Dead by Sunrise. Glendon Crain went on to join Godhead and later Hollywood Undead. Only advance copies of the album are available for promotional reviews. The album is not commercially available to purchase as the record label scrapped the release of the album.

Dunbar Magnet Middle School is administered by the Little Rock School District. It is named for the nationally known African- American poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar. With construction supported by the Rosenwald Fund and a matching program, the school was built in 1929. For nearly three decades it provided comprehensive education for black students in Little Rock, under a segregated system. Its curriculum covered junior and senior high school classes, as well as some junior college. After 1955 the junior college was discontinued and, with construction of a new high school, this building was devoted to junior high school. Later it was adapted as a magnet middle school in the public school system.  History = Dunbar Junior and Senior High School and Junior College  Sign indicating the school's past Dunbar Junior and Senior High School and Junior College, is located at the corner of Wright Avenue and Ringo Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. Named for Paul Laurence Dunbar, who was the first African American to gain national eminence as a poet. The institution has become significant in four distinct areas: African-American history, education history, legal history, and architecture/engineering achievement. Between 1929 and 1955, Dunbar provided comprehensive education for black students in Little Rock, under a state-segregated system. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Dunbar is located near the historically famous Little Rock Central High School and is a principal feeder into that school. Little Rock Central is also on the National Register of Historic Places. Since its construction in 1929, partially supported as a Rosenwald School, Dunbar was the site of the Negro School of Industrial Arts, the Paul Laurence Dunbar Junior and Senior High School (the city's \\"black school\\", as opposed to Little Rock Central, which was for white students in the segregated system), and Dunbar Junior College. Architecturally, Dunbar is a scaled miniature of Central High. Between 1929 and 1955, the school served as a junior and senior high school, with some classes developed for a junior college. In May 1955, the junior college program was abruptly terminated by the public school system, following the US Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education ruling that segregated education was unconstitutional. In the fall 1955, this school became used fully as a junior high school. High school students attended the recently opened Horace Mann High School.  Curriculum  In the early 21st century, most students take a foreign language class, and 6th graders are required to take nine weeks of Spanish, German, or French, plus Latin. Many go on to first and second-year courses in these languages. Central High maintains a foreign language program that culminates with Spanish VI, German VI, French VI, and Latin IV classes. Dunbar is the local anchor for an extensive Gifted and Talented program.

It is also known as the \\"MIX festival,\\" for its most visible program, the annual New York Lesbian and Gay Experimental Film Festival (NYLGEFF), which has featured early works by filmmakers such as Christine Vachon, Todd Haynes, Isaac Julien, Thomas Allen Harris, Barbara Hammer, Jonathan Caouette, Jennie Livingston, and Matthew Mishory.  History =1980s MIX was founded in 1987 by Sarah Schulman and Jim Hubbard. The festival was created because newly emerging Gay Film Festivals were not including formally inventive work, and the then vibrant experimental film venues marginalized gay and lesbian work. They were aided by curators Jack Waters and Peter Cramer from Naked Eye Cinema and Ela Troyano who programmed The New York Film Festival Downtown. The first festival featured the world premiere of Su Freidrich's Damned If You Don't, and from then on the festival became a showcase for new works by established makers, archival masters like Barbara Rubin's Christmas on Earth, and new emerging artists. Quickly, in concert with the emerging AIDS Activist and Queer Activist movement of the day- The New York Lesbian & Gay Experimental Film Festival (NYLGEFF) became a mass cultural event in the LGBT underground. Friday nights were guaranteed sold-out \\"Lesbian Date Nights\\" and a counter-culture of new interest in filmmaking and video production emerged around the festival community. MIX soon became very influential on other programming venues, often contributing significant work to The Whitney Biennial, Berlin International Film Festival and other important screens. MIX exhibited first films by major lesbian, gay and bisexual filmmakers including Todd Haynes' college thesis film, Assassins: A Film Concerning Rimbaud, (which got him his first review, ever), Maria Maggenti's Name Day, the first screening of Paris Is Burning, when it was still on a dual system, Christine Vachon's first film, and many others. Hubbard and Schulman prioritized artists' fees, paying all makers equally regardless of the length of their work, since in experimental film, labor intensivity was not determined by length. They included the first focus on films by and about black gay men in any film Festival. Schulman and Hubbard worked long and hard to get press review coverage for gay experimental work, often holding individual press screenings at the critic's convenience. They hand wheatpasted posters on buildings around the city, and leafleted areas where gay people hung out, like the piers and bars. MIX received no funding and managed to break even on enthusiastic box office support. They showed gay experimental film from other countries and brought films by hand to venues around the US, Europe and Japan. The festival has shown the work of filmmakers such as Barbara Hammer, Nisha Ganatra, Teri Rice, Jonathan Caouette, and Isaac Julien among hundreds more. As makers began to die of AIDS, Jim became active in film preservation, beginning with the film Avocada by the late Bill Vehr of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company. Eventually, he preserved over 2,000 hours of AIDS Film and Video, now available for free viewing at the New York Public Library. During Sarah and Jim's tenure, no one was ever turned away from MIX due to inability to pay. The festival also included Transsexual work from the very first year, with Marguerite Paris's film All Women Are Equal. They found ways of getting works by makers like Chantal Ackerman who did not show in gay festivals. Among many fabulous moments in the festival's history was MIX's screening of Andy Warhol's Blow Job which was attended by Kitty Carlisle Hart in a gown with a tuxedo'd escort. 1990s Hubbard & Schulman ran the festival together as a community event from 1987-1991. After the 1991 festival, Schulman wanted to devote more time to her writing. The 1992 festival was organized by Hubbard and filmmakers Marguerite Paris and Jerry Tartaglia. That year also introduced shows programmed by guest curators, who brought new perspectives to the line-up. Notable shows included Our Fanzine Friends, which drew upon the hot trend of queer zines, featuring work by Glenn Belverio and Bruce LaBruce; and Fire, featuring work from the African diaspora. This last program featured work by Dawn Suggs, Shari Frilot, Thomas Allen Harris and others. In 1993 Frilot and Karim Ainouz were the co- directors, and introduced many changes, including the name MIX, the production of a catalog (instead of handing our program notes), a new venue (The Kitchen instead of Anthology Film Archives) and a commitment to multicultural presentations and installation work. A stunning program that year was called The 1000 Dreams of Desire, curated by Jim Lyons. It was a special show featuring Teri Rice's The Kindling Point and Les Affaires, at the Ann Street Bookstore in Lower Manhattan, where the peep booths were reprogrammed with experimental video, and 16mm film was projected in a separate room. MIX returned to Anthology in 1994, and combined with DCTV's Lookout Lesbian & Gay Video Festival because DCTV's building was under renovation. Ainouz scaled back his involvement, and Frilot became the definitive voice of MIX, making the organization a home for emerging filmmakers and makers of color. This was signaled by 1994's opening feature, Brincando El Charco, and even more powerfully when 1995's opening and closing events were films by makers of color These films, Vintage: Families of Value by Thomas Allen Harris, and Frilot's own documentary Black Nations/Queer Nations, brought new audiences to MIX. They started satellite festivals such as MIX Brasil (1993) and MIX Mexico (1996). 1996 was the festival's 10th anniversary, and in honor of this milestone MIX presented queer work from the African diaspora at the Victoria Theater in Harlem, in addition to its downtown programs at NYU's Cantor Film Center and the Knitting Factory. Frilot headed MIX through 1996. Her other legacy was a commitment to installation work and the nascent digital realm. Installations were on view in 1993, on the upper floor of the Kitchen. But in 1994, Shu Lea Cheang and Beth Stryker curated Cyberqueer, in the basement galleries of Anthology. Although installations were presented in subsequent years, they never matched these early efforts until new MIX NYC staff began devoting substantial space and resources to installations in 2006. Frilot went on to become a curator at the Sundance Film Festival. Rajendra Roy was in charge in 1997, when the festival moved to Cinema Village, which was then a single-screen theater on E. 12th Street. In 1997 Ernesto Foronda and Maïa Cybelle Carpenter were programming coordinators for the festival. Carpenter stayed on until 1999, also curating additional programs in the years to follow. Roy brought on Anie Stanley as artistic director in 1998, and as a team they propelled MIX to greater visibility, with more corporate sponsorship, but with less emphasis on the identity politics of the early 1990s. 1998 also saw a sidebar of 8 mm films curated by Stephen Kent Jusick, featuring work by both contemporary makers and old masters, such as Jack Smith, and Andy Warhol's Polavision home movies. Roy is now the Celeste Bartos Chief Curator of Film at The Museum of Modern Art. 2000s Roy & Stanley stepped down after the 2000 festival, making way for Ioannis Mookas, who took the title of Executive Director. The organization, whose offices had been in the financial district, suffered after 9/11, and Mookas left after overseeing two festivals. MIX NYC as an organization took a new direction in 2003, when it initiated the ACT UP Oral History Project, run by Hubbard and Schulman (www.actuporalhistory.org), and funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation. This new effort gave the organization another aspect, different from being just a film festival. Larry Shea and Stephen Winter took the helm of the festival in 2003. Jonathan Caouette's Tarnation was shepherded into being under Winter's supervision, and its premiere as the festival centerpiece was the beginning of its illustrious path to Cannes, the New York Film Festival and a distribution deal with Wellspring in 2004. Shea and Winter also reimagined the 1000 Dreams of Desire program from 1993, re-staging it, with differences, at the same Ann Street location as the original. This time, in addition to the video booths and screening room on the upper floors, the basement was also cleared out, and set up with DJs, ambient 16mm & 8mm film projections, and a dance floor. A large-scale installation called Cake, about garment workers, by Mary Ellen Strom & Ann Carlson, debuted at South Street Seaport as the festival centerpiece. MIX expanded beyond the concept of the annual festival more in late 2004, with the introduction of MIXtv, which aired weekly on Manhattan Neighborhood Network. Yet MIX was unable to capitalize on the success of Tarnation, and financial troubles led Shea to move the festival from November to April 2005, skipping 2004 entirely. The opening night \\"happening\\" was held at the Gershwin Hotel, while regular screenings were at Anthology Film Archives. Jim Morrison created silk-screened T-shirts for the festival, the first time MIX had shirts since 1996. MIX began a community screening program, which took work to various neighborhoods and communities, beginning with the Bronx in February 2005. Larry Shea left MIX after the 2005 festival to devote more time to his video art, and a new team was appointed in the fall, including Andre Hereford, Szu Burgess, Kate Huh and Stephen Kent Jusick. Moving MIX back to its traditional November timeslot was the first decision of the new staff. In May 2006, MIX began the Naked Eye Celebrity Camera benefit, auctioning off disposable cameras exposed by artists and celebrities including Laurie Anderson, Gus Van Sant, B.D. Wong, Alec Soth and over 100 others. The 2006 festival, the 19th, was held at the new 3LD Art & Technology Center in Lower Manhattan, and featured two screening rooms as well as window installations and an installations lounge. The 2007 festival began with a name change, to the New York Queer Experimental Film Festival, after a few years of requests from the public to a name more inclusive than \\"Lesbian and Gay\\" and embracing of contemporary terminology. The festival was held in an empty storefront in SoHo, and marked a shift away from traditional theater venues. Installations covered the space, and led back to the makeshift screening room. Additional installations were in the mezzanine, overlooking the whole space. Many shows were packed, including the Butt magazine show, and Homoccult and other Esoterotica, guest curated by Daniel McKernan and Richie Rennt. Another highlight was a screening of a rare 16mm print shot by Women's Liberation Cinema (Kate Millett and Susan Kleckner, among others) of the 1971 gay pride march in New York. For this screening Sharon Hayes performed a live audio accompaniment. Hayes continued working with this material, and the film and recorded audio were included in Hayes's show at the Whitney Museum in 2012. In 2008 MIX took over a former Liz Claiborne department store in the South Street Seaport, filling every nook and cranny with installations, decorations and performances. The festival took place in October, earlier than its traditional mid-November dates, because the space, donated free of charge by the landlord, was only available at that time. This year MIX NYC initiated a program of artist-designed T-shirts celebrating the festival, each available in a limited edition. The 2009 festival took place in Chelsea for the first time since 1993, this time in an empty storefront of a newly constructed condo building. Ceiling to floor glass windows gave MIX unprecedented street visibility, including projections by Lori Hiris and Kadet Kuhne. Installations were prominent again, most notably a large geodesic dome that was Wildflowers of Manitoba, by Luis Jacob and Noam Gonick. A live actor inhabited the dome, silently lying there, listening to records, lighting incense and ruminating, while 3 projections illuminated some of the panels with scenes of a same-sex love and commitment. The closing night feature Maggots & Men, by Carey Cronenwett, was sold out, as were several other shows. The festival suffered some noise complaints from condo residents above, who felt that festival-goers were too loud. The 2010 festival was held at Theater for the New City, back in the East Village. Using three theater spaces in the TNC complex, MIX emphasized an immersive environment with a string art design in the venue by Diego Montoya. One smaller theater contained a performative installation by Daniel Pillis. Another theater was turned into an installation lounge, anchored by Blaise Garber-Paul's Queer Fruit Tree, which grew and changed throughout the week, and under which visitors could sit on astroturf, or on conical black cushions. The closing night film was Bruce LaBruce's L.A. Zombie, which sold out, and a second screening was added. In 2011 MIX took over a disused theater on Bleecker Street. The festival trailer, made on 16mm film by Gina Carducci, was projected on a continuous loop onto the building across the street, above the subway entrance. The venue design told a story of sorts. The lobby was dark with back-lit curtains that gave the impression of being in outer space. From there visitors could enter the screening room, or venture through lush psychedelic forest, and down steps to a subterranean space cave made of pink paper mache and pointy pink pillows. This downstairs space was a lounge, had a second stage used for performances, and contained most of the installations, including work by Adriana Varella, Szu Burgess, Coco Rico and others. The Occupy Wall Street movement was going on at the same time, and the NYPD raided Zuccotti Park just before the festival opened. As a result, MIX made the decision to open the venue as a sanctuary for queer Occupiers. The 25th MIX Festival took place in a two-story 20,000 sf former nut roasting factory in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn, the first time the festival had been held outside Manhattan. The first floor was a wide-open space that contained all of the many installations, as well as a small performance stage and many lounging areas. An interior design of spandex \\"explosions\\" filled the space, often running from ceiling to floor. The second floor, accessible only by a steep staircase, held the screening room, as well as 2 restrooms and administrative space. The closing night film was She Said Boom, about the Toronto band Fifth Column, with band member Caroline Azar in attendance. After the success of the festival in Brooklyn, the festival returned to Gowanus in 2013, taking over a 25,000 ft warehouse, which gave over about 15,000 sf to installation work, and 3600 sf screening room. The festival's visual theme was body parts, and a giant inflatable lung, which breathed slightly, greeted festival-goers as they entered. There were other inflatables, including Rachel Shannon's Breastival Vestibules, and other plastics that resembled veins. Jonathan Caouette returned to the festival with a new film that he finished hours before the screening at MIX NYC.

History In April 2003 Erik van der Luijt decided to record a new album and within a month he had picked 15 jazz standards, most of them from the repertoire he had been playing with his trio for the past seven years. However, three days before the original recording date he changed his mind. Van der Luijt quotes the fact that two members of the trio had recently married and all three had recently become a father as the drive behind the album. An increased sense of responsibility made them search more than ever for a distinctive style in order to draw more attention to themselves. Three days before the original recording date he decided that recording standards was not the best way to do this and began writing his own compositions. The trio recorded them without rehearsal, but decided to wait until the new material had grown on them. In the following months Van der Luijt wrote forty compositions. These were all recorded (at Donk Studios in the Netherlands) to be able to analyse them in the best possible way. At that point drummer Philip ten Bosch had to drop out. He had taken a full-time job to be able to support his family. This was a major setback to the project because his original style of drumming had become an important part of the trio's sound. He was replaced by Victor de Boo, who had briefly worked with Van der Luijt years earlier. The album Express Yourself was hailed as \\"a masterpiece\\" in the press. \\"Erik van der Luijt knows his Oscar Peterson, Tommy Flanagan and Bill Evans and used their influences to create an exquisite mixture in which coquetry and adventure go hand-in-hand.

The company was the reincarnation of the, at the time, bankrupt Media Vision Technology, who developed and manufactured multimedia peripherals such as the Pro Audio Spectrum 16.  History  On March 5, 1998 Creative Labs sued Aureal for patent infringement. Aureal countersued because they believed Creative was guilty of patent infringement. After numerous lawsuits Aureal won a favorable ruling in December 1999,PRNewsWire which vindicated Aureal from these patent infringement claims, but the legal costs were too high and Aureal filed for bankruptcy. On September 21, 2000, Creative acquired Aureal's assets from its bankruptcy trustee for US$32 million through the bankruptcy court, with the specific provision that Creative Labs would be released from all claims of past infringement by Creative Labs upon Aureal's A3D technology. The purchase included patents, trademarks, other property, as well as a release to Creative from any infringement by Creative of Aureal's intellectual property including A3D. The purchase effectively eliminated Creative's only competition in the gaming audio market. It also eliminated any requirements for Creative to pay past or future royalties as well as damages for products which incorporated Aureal's technology.  Technologies and products  Contrary to OEM companies (such as Creative which builds, brands and sells their own devices), Aureal was a fabless semiconductor company. This changed with their final product: the Aureal SuperQuad. However, to not anger the middlemen, Aureal did no marketing of its self-branded product. Vortex Sound card with AU8820B2-chip The Vortex audio accelerator chipset line from Aureal Semiconductor was designed to improve performance of their then-popular A3D audio technology. The first member of the line, the Vortex AU8820, was announced on July 14, 1997, and was used in by a number of sound card manufacturers, like Yamaha and Turtle Beach. After Aureal's release of A3D 2.0, the Vortex AU8830 (known as the Vortex 2) was announced on August 6, 1998. The Vortex 2 chipset won numerous industry awards, and was used among other places in the Diamond Monster Sound MX300, which achieved near-cult status with audiophiles and gamers for the high quality of its positional audio. Near the end of Aureal's existence, they released a Vortex Advantage budget sound card aimed at systems integrators, which ran on the Vortex AU8810 chipset. All Vortex soundcards are still functional with latest Windows 2000/Windows XP drivers in Windows Vista and Windows 7 (32 bit editions only). While Windows XP will recognize and work with the 8830 Vortex 2 chipset, there is an official Final Beta (v5.12.2568.0) available for download from a variety of sites which can be found via most internet search engines. There is also a modified version of the XP driver that can provide basic audio functionality for the Windows Vista operating system and may also function with Windows 7 beta releases. A3D A3D Logo A3D (Aureal 3-Dimensional) is the technology used by Aureal Semiconductor in their Vortex line of PC sound chips to deliver three-dimensional sound through headphones, two or even four speakers. The technology used head-related transfer functions (HRTF), which the human ear interprets as spatial cues indicating the location of a particular sound source. Many modern sound cards and PC games incorporated A3D via license from Aureal. Due to Aureal's acquisition (see below) the A3D technology is now part of the intellectual property of Creative Labs. The technology was originally developed by Crystal River Engineering for NASA's Virtual Environment Workstation Project (VIEW). Crystal River later commercialized the technology with a series of products including the Convolvotron and the Acoustetron. Aureal acquired Crystal River in May 1996 and rebranded the technology A3D. A3D differs from various forms of discrete positional audio in that it only requires two speakers, while surround sound typically requires more than four. The particular advantage of A3D is for dynamic or interactive environments such as simulations, games, video conference, and remote learning. A3D is not as effective for static productions such as movies which typically employ surround sound. A3D uses a subset of the actual in-game 3D world data to accurately model the location of both direct (A3Dspace) and reflected (A3Dverb) sound streams (A3D 2.0 can perform up to 60 first-order reflections). EAX 1.0, the competing technology at the time promoted by Creative Labs, simulated the environment with an adjustable reverb—it didn't calculate any actual reflections off the 3D surfaces. A3D was supported by 3DMark along with many other software titles of the late 1990s, including Half-Life, Unreal, Quake II, Jedi Knight, SiN, and Quake III Arena (up to version 1.25), and Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force. Following Aureal Semiconductor's acquisition by Creative, support for the API was discontinued.

It first became popular in the 1920s as a song in the British Boy Scouts and appeared in The Hackney Scout Song Book (Stacy & Son Ltd, 1921). The author was William Hope- Jones, a housemaster at Eton, who wrote it some time before 1914, as he sang it at a College dinner at that time. \\"Ho Jo\\" appears in the M. R. James' ghost story Wailing Well (1928), in which a group of masters take the Eton Scout Troop on an ill-fated camping expedition. The song recounts the ancient British tradition of fighting naked, dyed with woad. It has also been known as \\"The Woad Song\\" and \\"Woad of Harlech\\".

It is also referred to as Splicing by overlap extension / Splicing by overhang extension (SOE) PCR. It is used to insert specific mutations at specific points in a sequence or to splice smaller DNA fragments into a larger polynucleotide. Splicing of DNA Molecules This image shows how OE-PCR might be utilized to splice two DNA sequences (red and blue). The arrows represent the 3' ends As in most PCR reactions, two primers—one for each end—are used per sequence. To splice two DNA molecules, special primers are used at the ends that are to be joined. For each molecule, the primer at the end to be joined is constructed such that it has a 5' overhang complementary to the end of the other molecule. Following annealing when replication occurs, the DNA is extended by a new sequence that is complementary to the molecule it is to be joined to. Once both DNA molecules are extended in such a manner, they are mixed and a PCR is carried out with only the primers for the far ends. The overlapping complementary sequences introduced will serve as primers and the two sequences will be fused. This method has an advantage over other gene splicing techniques in not requiring restriction sites. To get higher yields, some primers are used in excess as in asymmetric PCR. Introduction of Mutations This image shows how OE-PCR might be utilized to delete a sequence from a DNA strand To insert a mutation into a DNA sequence, a specific primer is designed. The primer may contain a single substitution or contain a new sequence at its 5' end. If a deletion is required, a sequence that is 5' of the deletion is added, because the 3' end of the primer must have complementarity to the template strand so that the primer can sufficiently anneal to the template DNA. Following annealing of the primer to the template, DNA replication proceeds to the end of the template. The duplex is denatured and the second primer anneals to the newly formed DNA strand, containing sequence from the first primer. Replication proceeds to produce a strand of the required sequence, containing the mutation. The duplex is denatured again and the first primer can now bind to the latest DNA strand. The replication reaction continues to produce a fully dimerised DNA fragment. After further PCR cycles, to amplify the DNA, the sample can be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by electroelution for collection. Efficiently generating oligonucleotides beyond ~110 nucleotides in length is very difficult, so to insert a mutation further into a sequence than a 110 nt primer will allow, it is necessary to employ overlap extension PCR. In OE-PCR the sequence being modified is used to make two modified strands with the mutation at opposite ends, using the technique described above. After mixing and denaturation, the strands are allowed to anneal to produce three different combinations as detailed in the diagram. Only the duplex without overlap at the 5' end will allow extension by DNA polymerase in 3' to 5' direction. Following separation, the eluted fragments of appropriate size are subject to normal PCR, using the outermost primers used in the initial, mutagenic PCR reactions.

He took part in the construction of the Budapest subway and in 1894 invented a new type of valve essential for compressors still in widespread use today. He is also remembered today for his pseudoscientific Welteislehre (\\"World Ice doctrine\\").  Early life  Hanns Hörbiger was born in Atzgersdorf, a suburb of Liesing, Vienna and studied engineering at the local Technical College. In 1894 Hörbiger had an idea for a new design of blast furnace blowing engine: he replaced the old and easily damaged leather flap valves with a steel valve. Opening and closing automatically, and light and frictionless guided, the disk valve eliminated all the drawbacks of previous valve designs. Hörbiger registered a patent for his invention, which smoothed the way for efficient steel production and greater productivity in mining. High-pressure chemistry and the global network of gas exchange – none of these would be possible without the Hörbiger Valve. In 1900, Hanns Hörbiger and the engineer Friedrich Wilhelm Rogler founded an engineer’s office in Budapest, which was moved to Vienna in 1903. By 1925 it had developed into the Hörbiger & Co. company. Alfred Hörbiger, one of Hörbiger’s sons, joined the company in 1925 and assumed the management, while Hanns Hörbiger devoted himself to scientific study until his death in 1931. Two other sons, Attila and Paul became actors. The company developed rapidly under Alfred Hörbiger’s management: a production facility was taken into service in Vienna and an affiliated company was set up in Düsseldorf. Hörbiger expanded into England and concluded numerous licensing agreements with leading manufacturers of piston blowers, compressors and ships’ Diesel engines in Europe and North America. The success was driven by originality and inventive genius. The disk valve became more sophisticated: Hörbiger developed highlift or high-pressure valves, compressor control systems and damper plates. By 1937, 98 percent of production was destined for export. The name Hörbiger had become a dependable trademark in valve and control technology for compressors. As of 2017, the engineering company founded by Hanns Hörbiger still exists as HOERBIGER and is a major supplier of compression technology.http://www.hoerbiger.com  Welteislehre  Hörbiger is nowadays chiefly remembered for his Welteislehre (\\"World Ice Doctrine\\"), which he first put forward in the 1913 book, Wirbelstürme, Wetterstürze, Hagelkatastrophen und Marskanal-Verdoppelungen, written in collaboration with amateur astronomer Philipp Fauth. Hörbiger's theories were later popularized by H.S. Bellamy, and influenced Hans Robert Scultetus, head of the Pflegestätte für Wetterkunde (Meteorology Section) of the SS-Ahnenerbe, who believed that Welteislehre could be used to provide accurate long-range weather forecasts.  Occidental  Hörbiger (left) seated with at a conference for Occidental along with Edgar de Wahl (right), the creator of the language. Hörbiger was an early supporter and financial backer of the planned language Occidental, now officially known as Interlingue. His financial support was instrumental in allowing Occidental's main publication Cosmoglotta to \\"gain a circle of readers despite the economic crisis\\" during the period when its redactorial office was located in Vienna.  Family  Two of Hörbiger's sons, Paul and Attila, were matineé idols in the interwar years, and Paul Hörbiger's granddaughter Mavie Hörbiger also went on to become a celebrated actress. His two other sons devoted themselves to promoting their father's theory. Best known of the present Hörbiger generations is Attila's daughter Christiane.  Honors  The Deslandres crater on the Moon was designated Hörbiger by Philipp Fauth on his private lunar chart; it subsequently received the official name of Deslandres, following a 1942 suggestion by E. M. Antoniadi in 1942, which was approved at the International Astronomical Union's 1948 General Assembly. The name Hörbiger is still seen on the Hallwag moonmap made by Hans Schwarzenbach.

Solutions of alkali metals in ammonia are electride salts.Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. In the case of sodium, these blue solutions consist of [Na(NH3)6]+ and solvated electrons: :Na + 6 NH3 → [Na(NH3)6]+,e− The cation [Na(NH3)6]+ is an octahedral coordination complex. Solid salts Addition of a complexant like crown ether or 2,2,2-cryptand to a solution of [Na(NH3)6]+e− affords [Na (crown ether)]+e− or [Na(2,2,2-crypt)]+e−. Evaporation of these solutions yields a blue-black paramagnetic salt with the formula [Na(2,2,2-crypt)]+e−. Most solid electride salts decompose above 240 K, although [Ca24Al28O64]4+(e−)4 is stable at room temperature. In these salts, the electron is delocalized between the cations. Electrides are paramagnetic and Mott insulators. Properties of these salts have been analyzed.Wagner, M. J.; Huang, R. H.; Eglin, J. L.; Dye, J. L. Nature, 1994,368, 726-729. Reactions Solutions of electride salts are powerful reducing agents, as demonstrated by their use in the Birch reduction. Evaporation of these blue solutions affords a mirror of Na. Such solutions slowly lose their colour as the electrons reduce ammonia: :2[Na(NH3)6]+e− → 2NaNH2 \\\\+ 10NH3 \\\\+ H2 This conversion is catalyzed by various metals. An electride, [Na(NH3)6]+e−, is formed as a reaction intermediate. High-pressure elements Theoretical evidence supports electride behaviour in insulating high-pressure forms of potassium, sodium, and lithium. Here the isolated electron is stabilized by efficient packing, which reduces enthalpy under external pressure. The electride is identified by a maximum in the electron localization function, which distinguishes the electride from pressure-induced metallization. Electride phases are typically semiconducting or have very low conductivity, usually with a complex optical response.

It is the capital of Zwoleń County. Population is 8,048 (2009). Zwoleń belongs to Sandomierz Land of the historic province of Lesser Poland, and is located on the Zwoleńka river. The town has a sports club Zwolenianka, founded in 1923. The history of the town dates back to the early 15th century, when Zwoleń was founded on a privilege issued by King Władysław Jagiełło. In the 16th century, it already was a center of local trade, located along the road from Lublin to Radom and Greater Poland. In 1566–1575, Jan Kochanowski worked at a local Roman Catholic parish. At that time, the town belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship. During the Swedish invasion of Poland (see Deluge, 1655 - 1660), Zwoleń was destroyed to such a degree, that it never recovered. In late 18th century, during Partitions of Poland, Zwoleń was annexed by the Austrian Empire. Since 1807, it was part of Duchy of Warsaw, which in 1815 became Congress Poland, a protectorate of the Russian Empire. After January Uprising, Russian authorities deprived Zwoleń of its town rights, as a punishment for residents' support of the rebels. The village of Zwoleń stagnated for years, and did not regain its town rights until 1925. In 1921 Zwoleń had 8,544 residents, of which 3,787 were Jews. World War II The Nazi German invasion of Poland was disastrous for the town. Almost 80% of buildings were destroyed in air attacks and artillery bombardments. Houses around the market square and the local synagogue were burned. German occupiers carried out numerous mass executions of underground resistance fighters (from Home Army to Bataliony Chłopskie). At the beginning of 1941, the Nazi administration established a ghetto in the southern part of Zwoleń for local Jews as well as all transports from neighbouring villages. In March 1941, Jews from Przytyk were transferred to Zwoleń (fact disputed by some scholars claiming that by then Jews of Przytyk were already removed). On December 22, 1941 the Jüdischer Wohnbezirk was formally registered. By April 1942, the unfenced, open ghetto had some 4,500 inhabitants living in 239 houses (7 per room on average). Hundreds were homeless. On August 19–20, 1942 approximately 5,000 Jews were shipped in from Gniewoszów ghetto nearby. The Germans also brought to the ghetto Jews from other locations (Janowiec, Pionki, Jedlnia, Garbatka), further increasing their numbers. It is estimated that prior to mass deportations there were 6,500-10,000 Jews living there (top estimate by historian Adam Rutkowski has also been disputed). The Zwoleń ghetto was liquidated on 29 September 1942. All inmates (about 8,000 according to Daniel Blatman) were made to walk to the railway station in Garbatka. A few hundred prisoners unable to walk were shot along the way. From there, all Jews were transported in freight trains to Treblinka extermination camp where they were immediately gassed. Around 70 Jewish Holocaust survivors returned to Zwoleń after the war but soon moved on because of the hostility in post-war Poland. Postwar development In 1954, a new Zwoleń County of Kielce Voivodeship was created, which was a great boost to the town economy. Factories and new schools were opened including a meat plant and a branch of Radom's Łucznik Arms Factory. In 1975, after administrative reform of the communist Poland, all counties were dismissed, and Zwoleń became part of Radom Voivodeship. Zwoleń County returned in 1999 following the collapse of the Soviet empire. The town is located in southeastern corner of Mazovian Voivodeship, at the crossroads of two national roads: the 79th (Warsaw - Sandomierz - Kraków - Bytom), and the 12th (Łęknica - Dorohusk). Zwoleń does not have a rail station, but maintains bus connections with several towns and cities. The town has a sports club Zwolenianka and other sports associations. Every year in late June, The \\"Name day of Pan Jan\\" (\\"Imieniny Pana Jana\\") Festival takes place there, in memory of Jan Kochanowski.

It is used in many fields. One example is a concept forwarded by Masao Kawai as a means of studying primates in the field. It first appeared to Western primatologists in Kawai's book Life of Japanese Monkeys (1969). For primatologists, the kyokan method is a very subjective and empathic form of research. It involves feelings of mutual relationship, attachment and shared experience between both the researcher and their subject. In Kawai's own words; \\"By positively entering the group, by making contact on some level, objectivity can be established. It is on this basis that the experimental method can be introduced into natural behaviour study and which makes scientific analysis possible\\". His use of the term kyokan seems to be somewhat unusual amongst his peers in Japanese primatology, but the underlying principles are part of the foundation of the Japanese discipline in the field. Another example of how the word is used can be seen in game creation. Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Donkey Kong, Mario Brothers and The Legend of Zelda amongst other games, wants game creators to feel kyokan with the future users of their games.

It was built and is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers for the primary purpose of flood control. Secondary functions of the project include release of water stores to maintain barge traffic on the Mississippi River during seasons of drought, maintenance of a multi-use conservation pool for fish and wildlife enhancement and recreation (fishing, hunting, and boating), and release of sufficient water in droughts to maintain water quality for downstream communities. The base of the dam is bordered by Tuttle Creek State Park, which features of recreational areas, including nature trails, camping sites, and an artificial beach. The state park also hosted the Country Stampede Music Festival every summer from 1996 to 2018. Geography Excluding the of narrow valley below the dam, the project manages the drainage of the entire watershed of the Big Blue River, an area of that ranges from just north of Manhattan to the Platte River. The border between Riley County (on the west) and Pottawatomie County (on the east) is submerged underneath the lake. The dam is roughly two miles north of Manhattan, Kansas, and is crossed by Kansas Highway 13. Near the river delta at the lake's northern end, a bridge carrying Kansas Highway 16 spans the lake. History From 1903 to 1959, 25 floods damaged the areas of the Kansas River at Topeka; but, over the same period, there were also times of critical drought. With the growth of population and industry, there was envisioned projects to both contain excessive floodwaters and conserve water for release in drought. The Flood Control Act of 1938 authorized construction of Tuttle Creek Reservoir, and funds for initial planning were authorized in 1944. The construction of Tuttle Creek Dam as a Corps of Engineers project was given particular impetus by the Great Flood of 1951, which inundated downtown Manhattan, Topeka, and the West Bottoms of Kansas City. Total losses in the Kansas cities and farmland exceeded $725,000,000. Nevertheless, the project met with heavy opposition from landowners whose land faced flooding by the lake's construction. Residents of the Blue Valley organized opposition under the phrase \\"Let's quit this dam foolishness,\\" and the campaign led to victory for Democrat Howard Shultz Miller in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1952. Although the opposition was heated, it failed to ultimately stop the dam. \\"The Tubes\\" releasing about , May 31, 2019. Construction began on 1952. Closure of the dam (still under construction) occurred July 4, 1959 with diversion of the river though the completed intake tower (\\"The Tubes\\"). In 1960, dam contained a record snow melt; even though not yet finished, the dam was credited at that time with preventing $15,243,000 in damages. During this event, the tubes discharged , a record amount for the intake tower that was not matched or exceeded until the tower's estimated release on May 31, 2019. When the dam was completed and the lake began filling up in 1962, it affected ten towns and entirely submerged four of them (from north to south): Cleburne at , Randolph, Garrison Cross and Stockdale. The only town to rebuild elsewhere was Randolph, where the streets are named after the submerged towns. The remnants of \\"Old Randolph\\", as it's known locally, can still be seen partially submerged to this day. Spillway gates, May 2019. The value of the dam was particularly proven during the Great Flood of 1993, when floodwaters reaching up to 63 feet (19 m) above normal were held back. However, when the dam reached capacity in July 1993, it necessitated the first release of the spillway since its installation. All 18 gates on the spillway were raised 4 feet (1.2 m) during the peak of the flood, producing a flow rate of 60,000 cubic feet per second (1,700 m³/s) (with the tubes closed at that time). While this controlled flow rate resulted in flooding of low-lying homes and cropland, it was significantly less than the estimated peak flow of the downstream communities would have experienced on June 30 had the dam not been in place, an amount that would have topped the Big Blue River Levee and flooded downtown Manhattan. The roar of the water was audible half a mile (800 m) away and some people in nearby Manhattan reported hearing the noise.  1993 spillway chute erosion and repair  Johnson Shale head cut, deepest erosion in the spillway. After three weeks of release in 1993, the spillway gates were closed, revealing over of freshly exposed rock formations. This attraction became known locally as the Little Grand Canyon or \\"The Canyon\\".  Erosion  Below the gates lies of concrete-lined chute followed by about of unlined chute, originally maintained with grass cover. Erosion of the unlined chute during a spillway release was a factor of the design. As expected, the released water had rapidly scoured away all soil on the floor of the unlined chute and then quickly removed a few feet of loose, weathered rock, exposing solid, durable limestone shelves. Each of these limestone ledges experienced head cutting, where the underlying soft shale was eroded away; weakening, collapsing, and washing away some horizontal distance of the limestone at a rate much slower than the first removal of the looser material. Rock left exposed below the Spillway Cycle Area, with beaver dam. Each of these headcuts have a relatively resistant limestone bed on top and easily erodible rock (shale) underneath. Two particularly resistant limestone formations formed notable shelves: The limestone beds of the Red Eagle Formation topped a cliff (pictured), and from the base of that cliff stretched out of the Long Creek limestone bed of the Foraker Formation (now covered by a beaver dam).  Geologic study  This area is of interest to geologists due to its superb exposure of the 300 million year old rocks of the upper- Carboniferous and lower-Permian underlying the Flint Hills. In this one location, five formations can be studied that are rarely exposed in great extent singly, let alone all together in an extended horizontal presentation. These strata attest to a flat, arid paleoenvironment along the western margin of Pangaea with intermittent marine transgressions from the Panthalassa Ocean. Conditions there may have been analogous to the modern-day Persian Gulf coast of the Arabian Peninsula. As sea levels rose and fell over the course of many millennia, so too did the depositional environment change, resulting in repeating sequences of rock strata distinctive to the late paleozoic. In periods of high sea-level, limestone and shale were deposited, while periods of low sea-level resulted in the deposition of red and green clays and paleosols, giving the exposures at the spillway \\"canyon\\" a colorful \\"layer cake\\" appearance.  Spillway chute repair  Resodded covering of the upper unlined chute in 2019. Impressiveness of the 1993 geologic display aside, there was concern about the durability of the spillway in future releases. The structure and strength of the spillway's bedrock was studied to determine any necessary course of repair, reinforcement, or replacement. During the 1993 spillway release, daily photographs were taken of the rushing water at nine different locations to measure the speed of the expected head cutting. Analysis determined that the spillway could still survive 10 times the intensity of the 1993 release (the maximum the spillway was designed to release). However, the previously unexposed Roca Shale, which had demonstrated remarkable durability during the release, was expected to undergo rapid severe deterioration if left open to the effects of the Kansas climate. So, it was determined that minimal repair was to be made to the upper length of the chute. Weaker and fractured limestone shelves were grouted and then buttressed with shotcrete, and then the area was covered with terraced soil and returned to grass. Soil pH was adjusted to further protect the reburied rock. The rock formations of the lower portion were left exposed.  Earthquake threat and mitigation  Tuttle Creek Lake near the dam. Although Kansas is not widely known as seismically active, the Humboldt fault line associated with the Nemaha Ridge passes through eastern Kansas, and probably the most active region on the line is in the general vicinity of the lake. Studies that began in the 1980s showed that the geology of the area could potentially produce an earthquake capable of causing the dam to fail, which could risk the lives of thousands downstream in the Blue River and Kansas River valleys. To address this threat, the Army Corps of Engineers completed a project in July 2010 that reinforced the dam with more than 350 concrete walls to stop channels in the underlying karst, and equipped it with warning sensors.

Cigars are currently owned by two Imperial Brands subsidiaries, Habanos S.A. in Cuba and Altadis in the Dominican Republic.  History  The Romeo y Julieta marque was established in 1875 by Inocencio Alvarez and Manin García. The brand is the Spanish name for Shakespeare's famous tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. Between 1885 and 1900, the brand won numerous awards at different tasting exhibitions (as still evidenced by the gold medals on the brand's logo). However, the brand truly bloomed after it was acquired by José \\"Pepin\\" Rodriguez Fernández, former head of the Cabañas factory in Havana, and his firm, Rodríguez, Argüelles y Cia, in 1903. Being a very cosmopolitan man, Rodriguez constantly travelled across Europe and the Americas, actively promoting his brand, and entering his horse, the aptly named Julieta, in racing events across the world. As a result of his salesmanship, the brand became exceptionally popular around the world among wealthy customers, many of whom demanded personalized bands for their cigars. At its height, as many as 2000 personalized cigar bands were produced for customers. The branded was also known at this time for specializing in figurado cigars, such as perfectos and pirámides, with over a thousand such shapes believed to have been in production. Sir Winston Churchill was perhaps the brand's most famous devotee.Marca Romeo y Julieta The flagship vitola of the brand is named in his honor, a long 7\\" by 47 ring gauge cigar known as the Churchill.

In most cases personal bankruptcy is initiated by the bankrupt individual. Bankruptcy is a legal process that discharges most debts, but has the disadvantage of making it more difficult for an individual to borrow in the future. To avoid the negative impacts of personal bankruptcy, individuals in debt have a number of bankruptcy alternatives.  Take no action  Bankruptcy prevents a person's creditors from obtaining a judgment against them. With a judgment a creditor can attempt to garnish wages or seize certain types of property. However, if a debtor has no wages (because they are unemployed or retired) and has no property, they are \\"judgment proof\\", meaning a judgment would have no impact on their financial situation. Creditors typically do not initiate legal action against a debtor with no assets, because it is unlikely they could collect the judgment. If enough time passes, seven years in most jurisdictions, the debt is removed from the debtor's credit history. A debtor with no assets or income cannot be garnished by a creditor, and therefore the \\"Take No Action\\" approach may be the correct option, particularly if the debtor does not expect to have a steady income or property a creditor could attempt to seize. Self money management Debt is a result of spending more than one's income in a given period. To reduce debt, the most obvious solution is to reduce monthly spending to allow extra cash flow to service debt. This can be done by creating a personal budget and analyzing expenses to find areas to reduce expenses. Most people, when reviewing a written list of their monthly expenses, can find ways to reduce expenses. Common areas for expense reduction would include reducing food expenses by eating out less often, taking public transportation instead of driving a car, and eliminating enhanced telephone and cable television services.  Negotiate with creditors  Creditors understand that bankruptcy is an option for debtors with excessive debt, so most creditors are willing to negotiate a settlement so that they receive a portion of their money, instead of risking losing everything in a bankruptcy. Negotiation is a viable alternative if the debtor has sufficient income, or has assets that can be liquidated so that the proceeds can be applied against the debt. Negotiation may also buy the debtor some time to rebuild their finances. For a business, a restructuring agreed with the creditors is a common approach but this requires the agreement of all creditors.  Debt restructuring  Debt restructuring is a process that allows a private or public company - or a sovereign entity - facing cash flow problems and financial distress, to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent debts in order to improve or restore liquidity and rehabilitate so that it can continue its operations. Out-of court restructurings, also known as workouts, are increasingly becoming a global reality. A debt restructuring is usually less expensive and a preferable alternative to bankruptcy. The main costs associated with a business debt restructuring are the time and effort to negotiate with bankers, creditors, vendors and tax authorities. Debt restructurings typically involve a reduction of debt and an extension of payment terms.  Debt consolidation  Debt is a problem if the interest payments are greater than the debtor can afford. Debt consolidation typically involves borrowing from one lender (typically a bank), at a low rate of interest, sufficient funds to repay a number of higher interest rate debts (such as credit cards). By consolidating debts, the debtor replaces many payments to many different creditors with one monthly payment to one creditor, thereby simplifying their monthly budget. In addition, the lower interest rate means that more of the debtor's monthly payment is applied against the principal of the loan, resulting in faster debt repayment. It may be necessary to have a co-signor or other security, such as a car, if the borrower's credit is not sufficient on their own.  Formal proposal to creditors  If the debtor cannot deal with their debt problems through personal budgeting, negotiation with creditors, or debt consolidation, the final bankruptcy alternative is a formal proposal or deal with the creditors. Different countries have different legal procedures for compromising debts. In the United States, a debtor can file a Chapter 13 Wage Earner Plan. The plan will typically last for up to five years, during which time the debtor makes payments that are distributed to their creditors. In Canada, a Consumer Proposal can be filed with the assistance of a government-licensed proposal administrator. Forty-five days after filing the proposal the creditors vote on the proposal, which is considered accepted if more than half of the creditors, by dollar value, vote to approve it.  Individual Voluntary Arrangement  In the UK the individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) represents the main formal alternative to a debtors bankruptcy petition. The IVA is part of the Insolvency Act 1986 and essentially allows a debtor to reach a formal repayment arrangement with their creditors usually over a 5-year period. In most cases the debtor does not repay their debts in full to their creditors however the IVA proposal essentially allows for any remaining debt to be written off by the creditors at the end of the 5 year repayment period. As with bankruptcy petitions the number of IVA proposals has been increasing rapidly in the UK in recent years.

Roy Vagelos or Roy Vagelos, is an American physician and business executive, who was president and chief executive officer (1985) and chairman (1986) of the American pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. (known as MSD outside the U.S.). Since 1995, Vagelos has served as chairman of the board of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. He was founding chair of the Prix Galien USA awards committee (from 2007-2017) and was the first recipient of the Galien Foundation's Pro Bono Humanum Award, which in 2018 was renamed in his honor to the Roy Vagelos Pro Bono Humanum Award for Global Health Equity. In addition to his business accomplishments, Vagelos is the author of more than 100 scientific papers. He is also on the Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and has funded three of the university's elite undergraduate programs: The Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS), The Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM) and The Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER).  Biography  Vagelos grew up during the Depression as a son of Greek immigrants. He attended Rahway High School in his hometown of Rahway, New Jersey.Peterson, Iver. \\"A Company Move That Hasn't Irked the Neighbors\\", The New York Times, November 15, 1992. Accessed October 19, 2007. \\"In addition, Merck & Co. donated $40,000 to fund a study on improving Rahway's downtown business district, it paid $126,000 to help cover the cost of paving some roads adjoining its complex, and it put new scientific equipment in Rahway High School, the alma mater of Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, the corporate chairman.\\" After winning a partial scholarship, he left his family's small restaurant in Rahway, to become a doctor.Johnson, Robert. \\"Looking Back Is Not an Option\\", The New York Times, November 28, 2004.

Vagelos later earned an M.D. from Columbia University in 1954. Vagelos deferred military service while in medical school, but he was obligated to serve a two-year stint as an Army doctor. As a Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons trained physician, Vagelos obtained a two-year assignment as a scientist at the National Institutes of Health (1956–1966). For Vagelos, it was a fateful turning point. He was associated with Massachusetts General Hospital, Washington University and the Washington University School of Medicine (1966–1975) before joining Merck, Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories in Rahway. The author of more than 100 scientific papers, Vagelos has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. In 1995, Vagelos received the NAS Award for Chemistry in Service to Society and was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1999, he became a recipient of both the Bower Award for Business Leadership, as well as the Othmer Gold Medal. In 2013, Vagelos was invited to speak at the first annual Stony Brook University Research Your Future Symposium. River blindness In the mid-1980s, Merck & Co. discovered the drug ivermectin, capable of combatting the parasite that causes river blindness. At the time, the World Health Organization and the World Bank were conducting a campaign against the vector-borne disease in West Africa, and ivermectin was the most important drug in their arsenal. But the newly discovered drug was too expensive for those patients or their governments. Vagelos \\"wanted to see the drug widely used,\\" so he influenced Merck & Co. to \\"make needed quantities of the drug available to these governments and patients, at no cost to them, for the treatment of onchocerciasis.” Over two decades, beginning in 1986, the drug reached more than 55 million people. The public health campaign was successful, and now river blindness is no longer a major public health issue in the savannah areas of West Africa. Philanthropy Together, Roy Vagelos and his wife Diana Vagelos donated over $15 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create the Roy and Diana Vagelos Laboratories. These funds also made possible the founding the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences, an intensive program offered to University of Pennsylvania freshmen. In addition, they donated funds to launch the Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management, a joint program between the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and its College of Arts and Sciences. Later, they founded the Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research, supporting the necessity of energy research. In 2010, Vagelos, who had earned his medical degree at Columbia University, and Diana, an alumna of Barnard College at Columbia University, donated 50 million dollars to the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, towards the construction of a new building named the Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center; it opened in August 2016. In 2017, it was announced at the Crown Awards that the College of Physicians and Surgeons would be renamed the Columbia University Roy and Diana Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in recognition of a $250 million gift given by Vagelos to the college. A substantial part of the donation ($150 million) would be used to endow a fund that will help eliminate student loans for medical students who qualify for financial aid. Altogether, the Vageloses have been responsible for about $450 million in philanthropy to Columbia's medical school.

During its career in the Dutch Navy it was most notable for being the ship Queen Wilhelmina sent to Portuguese East Africa to transport Paul Kruger to Europe during the Second Boer War. The ship was taken over by the Germans during World War II and renamed Niobe. She was sunk in Kotka harbour in Finland on 16 July 1944. Service history The ship was built at the Maatschappij voor Scheeps- en Werktuigbouw Fijenoord in Rotterdam and launched on 28 September 1898. The ship was commissioned on 15 July 1900. On 22 November that year she arrived in Marseille with Paul Kruger who she had picked up in Lourenço Marques by order of the Dutch Government. After dropping Kruger off she left for the Dutch East Indies. During this trip while entering the harbor of Port Said she collided with the British steamer Peterson. The collision required the ship to be repaired at Suez. On 6 January 1901 she could resume her journey and arrived three days later on 9 January in Surabaya. On 6 July 1904 Gelderland and both ran aground near Aroes Lampoejang, South Sumatra because of incomplete maps. The ships were repaired in Surabaya and Singapore respectively. On 17 June 1905 Gelderland and her sisters and Utrecht returned to the Netherlands. The journey involved stops in Tanjung Priok Mahé, Perim, Port Said, Algiers and Tangier arriving at Den Helder on 30 August that year. In 1908 Gelderland, together with her sisters and , was sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the second Castro crisis. On 17 June 1911 Gelderland left Rotterdam for England. On board was Prince Henry of the Netherlands who traveled to the United Kingdom to attend the coronation of George V. For the last part of the journey Gelderland was escorted by four British torpedo boats. Gelderland was sent to Constantinople on 11 November 1912 because of rising political tension and a direct war threat. A landing party of 100 men was put ashore and took position in the legations section of the city on 18 November 1912. She was relieved by on 30 May 1913. While patrolling along the Dutch coast an explosion occurred on 14 March 1917, killing one man and severely wounding nine others. After returning to port the ship was taken out of service for maintenance. After World War I she served as an artillery training ship in the Dutch navy. World War II The ship was seized by the Germans during their invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, and Gelderland joined the German Kriegsmarine under the new name of Niobe. She was in use between 1940 and 1944 first as a cruiser, then as a training ship, and finally as an anti-aircraft cruiser (\\"Flakschiff\\"). The wreck of Niobe in Kotka During the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive of 1944 the Soviets tried to finish the Continuation War with the Finns. The Germans came to the aid of the Finns, and, among the materiel brought with them, was the anti-aircraft cruiser Niobe, which was ordered to strengthen the air defences of Kotka, then one of the most bombed cities in Finland. At the same time, the Soviet Union had put much emphasis on finding and sinking the Finnish coastal defence ship . Soviet aerial reconnaissance identified a large ship in Kotka harbour and the decision was taken to attack, with 132 bombers and fighters (sent by, amongst others, the 51st Mine-Torpedo Aviation Regiment of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet), on 16 July 1944. The ship was, however, Niobe, and the aircraft were met with fierce resistance. An A-20 Havoc bomber was shot down, but the ship was hit and sank. The guns of the Niobe were still firing as she settled in the shallow water, after which, much of her superstructure remained visible above sea level. Seventy of the crew of the Niobe died. Niobe was raised and scrapped in 1953. ReferencesBibliography * * External links *Niobe sinking (in Russian) *Gelderland page *Niobe *Pictures and facts * 02.

Central Avenue is a major north-south thoroughfare in the central portion of the Los Angeles, California metropolitan area. Located just to the west of the Alameda Corridor, it runs south from the eastern end of the Los Angeles Civic Center down to the east side of California State University, Dominguez Hills and terminating at East Del Amo Boulevard in Carson. From north to south, Central Avenue passes through Downtown Los Angeles, the areas of South Los Angeles (including Watts, Florence-Graham, Willowbrook), the city of Compton, and the city of Carson, which is part of the 17-city South Bay area of Los Angeles County. History Central Avenue had two all-black segregated fire stations. Fire Station No. 30 and Fire Station No. 14 were segregated in 1924. They remained segregated until 1956 when the Los Angeles Fire Department was integrated. The listing on the National Register says, \\"All-black fire stations were simultaneous representations of racial segregation and sources of community pride.\\" Significance in music history From approximately 1920 to 1955, Central Avenue was the heart of the African-American community in Los Angeles, with active rhythm and blues and jazz music scenes. Local luminaries included Eric Dolphy, Art Pepper, Chico Hamilton, Clora Bryant, and Charles Mingus. Other jazz and R&B; musicians associated with Central Avenue in LA include Benny Carter, Buddy Collette, Dexter Gordon, Lionel Hampton, Hampton Hawes, Big Jay McNeely, Johnny Otis, Shifty Henry, Charlie Parker (briefly), Gerald Wilson, Anthony Ortega, Onzy Matthews and Teddy Wilson. Commenting on its historical prominence, Wynton Marsalis once remarked that \\"Central Avenue was the 52nd Street of Los Angeles.\\" Although Central Avenue is no longer the thriving jazz center it was, its legacy is preserved by the Central Avenue Jazz Festival and a small number of jazz clubs, including Bluewhale in Little Tokyo. Leon Hefflin, Sr. produced the first largest outdoor jazz entertainment event of its kind, the “Cavalcade of Jazz,” held at Wrigley Field which was located on 42nd place in Los Angeles, part of the Central Ave Jazz Scene and showcased over 125 artist from 1945 to 1955.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. The Cavalcade of Jazz concerts were the stepping stone to success for such stars as Toni Harper, Dinah Washington, Roy Milton, Frankie Lane and others. He also hosted a beauty contest at the events. His first COJ show starred Count Basie, The Honey Drippers, Valaida Snow, Joe Turner, The Peters Sisters, Slime and Bam and more artists on September 23, 1945 with a crowd of 15,000. Etta James. Jefferson High School, located south east of Downtown Los Angeles, served as a school to a community that not only was located at the heart of South Central’s jazz scene at the time (in the 1930s), but also one that nurtured Jazz affluent students. These students, who would later go on to establish themselves as either jazz/blues artists/singers, would follow robust music curriculum, which included courses in music theory, music appreciation, harmony, counterpoint, orchestra, band and choir. Many of Central Avenue’s most accomplished jazz, blues, and bebop players were graduates of this public high school just off the Avenue. The origin of jazz in Los Angeles has been attributed to a number of musicians who moved there from New Orleans. Nightclubs became the physical manifestation of jazz music, and these were mainly located along Central Avenue from Little Tokyo to Watts. The school produced many prominent musicians, including Etta James, Curtis Williams, Big Jay McNeely, and Richard Berry. Jefferson High School served as a pivotal structure to a newly established African-American enclave after the turn of the 20th century. The same way many know Harlem as a historically African- American enclave, the area in and around Central Ave was ironically referred to as “Little Harlem” due to its striking similarities. Harlem’s Apollo theatre and its importance to the neighborhood can be taken by the same token in referring to the many Jazz clubs on Central Ave. However, in this case, looking at the ethnographic nature of Central Ave and its establishing of a Jazz scene and culture, Jefferson High School’s contribution cannot be overstated. Such an institution served in nurturing students, musicians, and athletes—all the while sparking an inevitable culture of Jazz within the already affluent Jazz population. Central Ave paved way for many historic happenings in Los Angeles, most importantly being the many significant structures that contributed to both the creation of an African-American enclave and Jazz scene on the West Coast. It was in 1920, when the Jazz scene on Central began to swing, and from 1920 to 1955 it was the heart of the African-American community in Los Angeles. Lionel Hampton composed and performed a tune called \\"Central Avenue Breakdown\\". Dave Alvin's tribute to Big Joe Turner, \\"The Boss of the Blues\\", describes a drive down Central Avenue and Turner's reminiscences about the scene. Lionel Hampton performed for the 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th and the11th Cavalcade of Jazz concerts. The crowning of the first Cavalcade of Jazz Queen was postponed due to a showdown between Big Joe Turner and Lionel Hampton's band at the 5th concert. The crowd started throwing pillows, programs, and bottles into the field as the band parading back to the stage. Underground rapper Bones names a song \\"CentralAve\\" on album \\"Rotten\\" (2014). Landmarks and major attractions Near its northern end, Central Avenue passes through Little Tokyo, Los Angeles' oldest Japanese neighborhood and now a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On Central Avenue just north of First Street is the former Hompa Hongwangi Buddhist Temple. It was declared Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No.313 in 1986. Across Central Avenue from the Temple is the Japanese American National Museum, and north of that is the original (and largest) branch of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, now known as the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA. Dunbar Hotel, 2008 In the 1200 block of Central Avenue is the 1930s era Streamline Modern Los Angeles bottling plant of the Coca-Cola company, designed to resemble an ocean liner, complete with porthole windows and metal-railed catwalks. It was declared Los Angeles Historic-cultural Monument #138 in 1975. At 2300 Central is the now closed Lincoln Theatre, opened in 1926 and was long the leading venue in the city for African-American entertainment. It was declared Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument # 744 in 2003. At 4233 Central Avenue is the Dunbar Hotel, Los Angeles Historic- Cultural Monument #131 since 1974. Built in 1928 by Drs. John and Vada Sommerville, The Dunbar was a place where Black travelers could stay in style and comfort during the era of racial segregation in the United States, when African-Americans were banned from Los Angeles's major hotels. The Dunbar was also the place where Black celebrities were most likely to stay, attracting the likes of Louis Armstrong (\\"Satchmo\\"), Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, and Billie Holiday. It was the epicenter of the Los Angeles jazz scene in the 1940s and 1950s. The Dunbar is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At 4261 Central Avenue is Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #580, the 1928 Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building, original headquarters of one of the leading African-American owned insurance business companies the state of California. Front entrance to Jefferson High School. Located just off of Central Ave on 1319 E 41st St, Thomas Jefferson High School is central to understanding the Jazz music and the \\"Jazz scene\\" for which the area was prominent. Jefferson High School’s importance to Central Ave and its Jazz scene can be attributed to its jazz-nurturing curriculum along with many prominent Jazz figures that it has both produced and has been associated with. Jefferson High served as a pivotal touchstone to the newly established African-American enclave and contributed greatly to the development of West Coast Jazz. It was at Jefferson where Samuel Brown (first African-American music teacher in the Los Angeles public school system) taught music and served as a major influence in teaching and mentoring promising jazz musicians from Los Angeles. Due to Mr. Brown's dedication, Jefferson High School has produced more jazz musicians and composers than any other high school west of the Mississippi. 27th Street Bakery in December 2018 Located on the corner of 27th Street and Central Ave at 2700 Central Ave is 27th Street Bakery, now famous for its sweet potato pie. The bakery was initially a restaurant that was established in the 1930s by Harry Patterson and his wife. The couple catered to the African-American migrants from the Southern states who settled on and near Central Avenue. In 1956, the owners decided to turn it into a bakery. The 27th Street Bakery is one of the few remaining African-American owned businesses on Central Ave. The bakery has been in the same family for three generations and is currently owned by Jeanette Pickens, the granddaughter of Harry Patterson, the founder of the bakery. 27th Street Bakery is the largest manufacturer of sweet potato pies on the West Coast of the United States. You can now find their pies in retail stores such Ralphs, Albertsons, 7 Eleven, KFC and Louisiana Famous Fried Chicken. The bakery suffered greatly after the 1992 LA Riots due to the extreme damage done to the neighborhood. Because clientele could not access the bakery for about two weeks, business temporarily decreased. From the 1950s to the 1990s, the bakery catered towards the needs of the predominant African-American community. Due to the growing population of Latinos/Hispanics in the area in the early 2000s, the bakery expanded their menu to include concha (bread)/pan dulce and empanadas to cater to this new community and also have their menu available in Spanish. With the advent of the digital age, the bakery has added online services. The 27th Street Bakery is a core part of Central Ave and its surrounding areas and continues to evolve. The Central Avenue Jazz Festival is a yearly free music festival held during the last weekend of July along a stretch of Central Avenue which includes the Dunbar Hotel. The festival features jazz, blues, and Latin Jazz performed by both well-known and upcoming artists from the area. Transportation Central Avenue provides bus service along Metro Local: Line 53.

New Sounds: A Listener's Guide to New Music. Harper & Row, 1987. 59. Rich harmonies, comprising string and brass, are gradually overlaid over the stanza. The piece was first recorded for use in a documentary which chronicles street life in and around Elephant and Castle and Waterloo, in London. When later listening to the recordings, Bryars noticed the clip was in tune with his piano and that it conveniently looped into 13 bars.Howse, Christopher. \\"The Assurance of Hope\\". Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. xix. For the first LP recording, he was limited to a duration of 25 minutes; later he completed a 60-minute version of the piece for cassette tape; and with the advent of the CD, a 74-minute version. It was shortlisted for the 1993 Mercury Prize. Bryars says: :In 1971, when I lived in London, I was working with a friend, Alan Power, on a film about people living rough in the area around Elephant and Castle and Waterloo Station. In the course of being filmed, some people broke into drunken song – sometimes bits of opera, sometimes sentimental ballads – and one, who in fact did not drink, sang a religious song \\"Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet\\". This was not ultimately used in the film and I was given all the unused sections of tape, including this one. :When I played it at home, I found that his singing was in tune with my piano, and I improvised a simple accompaniment. I noticed, too, that the first section of the song – 13 bars in length – formed an effective loop which repeated in a slightly unpredictable way [in the notes for the 1993 recording on Point, Bryars wrote that while the singer's pitch was quite accurate, his sense of tempo was irregular]. I took the tape loop to Leicester, where I was working in the Fine Art Department, and copied the loop onto a continuous reel of tape, thinking about perhaps adding an orchestrated accompaniment to this. The door of the recording room opened on to one of the large painting studios and I left the tape copying, with the door open, while I went to have a cup of coffee. When I came back I found the normally lively room unnaturally subdued. People were moving about much more slowly than usual and a few were sitting alone, quietly weeping. :I was puzzled until I realised that the tape was still playing and that they had been overcome by the old man's singing. This convinced me of the emotional power of the music and of the possibilities offered by adding a simple, though gradually evolving, orchestral accompaniment that respected the homeless man's nobility and simple faith. Although he died before he could hear what I had done with his singing, the piece remains as an eloquent, but understated testimony to his spirit and optimism.\\" Versions The original 25-minute version of the piece was first performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in December 1972, and recorded for Brian Eno's Obscure label in 1975. In 1990 the Gavin Bryars ensemble recorded a 60-minute version, in a restored water-tower in Bourges, France, for Les Disques du Crepuscule. A 74-minute version was recorded in 1993 for the Point label with Tom Waits singing along with the original recording of the man who was homeless during the later sections. In 2019 Gavin Bryars released a live 25-minute version with his ensemble, which included all four of his children, on GB Records In 1981, choreographer Maguy Marin used the piece as the score for her Beckett-inspired work May B. In 1993, William Forsythe used the piece as the score for his 25-minute work Quintett for the Frankfurt Ballet. The piece has subsequently been performed by several other dance companies. In 2003, Christian band Jars of Clay covered it on their sixth full-length studio album Who We Are Instead on Essential Records. In 2006, Art of Time Ensemble released a 16-minute version on their debut album Live In Toronto. In 2011, The Music Tapes performed a cover of this song using Bryars' original tape sample for NPR's Tiny Desk Concert series. In April 2019, a 12-hour overnight version was performed in London's Tate Modern art gallery, directed by Gavin Bryars. Performers included two groups of homeless people (one vocal, one instrumental), together with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, the Southbank Sinfonia, and Bryars' own ensemble.

The firm was founded by James Shears (c1750-1820) and continued by his two sons Daniel Towers Shears (1784–1860) and James Henry Shears (1788–1855) and subsequently by William Shears. The origins of the company James Shears was born in about 1750, the son of Thomas Shears (1709–1778) and Sarah Towers (? – 1766). He was baptised at All Saint's Church, Ockham, Surrey on 2 September 1750.Ockham Parish Records (Baps, Marr, Bur 1568–1812), held at the Surrey History Centre, Woking Surrey James Shears was married to Ann Pitcher on 16 June 1772 at St Giles, Cripplegate, London.Guildhall, St Giles Cripplegate, Marriages, 1754 – 1781, P69/GIS/A/01/Ms 6421/1 His death on 25 June 1820 at the age of 70 is recorded in the Morning Chronicle, 26 June 1820. He entered the copper trade at the age of about 12,According to a letter written by his daughter-in-law, Frances Shears (née Spurrell), now held at the Norfolk Records Office, he celebrated fifty years in the copper trade in 1812. probably in the workshop of the coppersmith William Gore. Gore first appears in London directories in 1768 with premises at Fleet-ditch (an earlier name for Fleet Market). In 1770 the first mention occurs of William Gore at 67 Fleet-market, the address at which the company was to remain until at least 1822. By 1779 Gore had taken James Shears into partnership and the firm became Gore & Shears. In about 1785 Gore either retired or died and Shears continued the business in his name alone. Both Gore and Shears were members of the London livery company, the Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers. In 1799 he was elected to the Corporation of the City of London as Councillor for the ward of Farringdon Without. In 1810 Shears and his sons still appear to have been resident in the Fleet Market premises at Fleet Market, but at the time of his death James Shears had a house at The Oval, Kennington. Much of the company's business at this period appears to have been as suppliers to the brewing trade, especially of the copper vats used in beer-making process. They also manufactured boilers for steam engines and so established close and enduring links with the Birmingham firm of Boulton and Watt, the leading manufacturers of steam engines. Several instances are known of Boulton & Watt recommending Shears to customers who had purchased an engine and required a suitable boiler.See for example a correspondence covering the years 1779–84 between Shears, Boulton & Watt and Cornish mine owners in the Boulton & Watt papers in Birmingham Central Library, MS/3147/3/375. Further references to Shears in this collection are MS/3147/3/437/S1 (1790), MS/3147/3/484/178-9 (1836). In 1804 Boulton & Watt recommended Shears to the American engineer, Robert Fulton, who required a boiler for a steam ship, H.W. Dickinson, Robert Fulton, engineer and artist (London, 1913) Later the company also had connections with the sugar refining industry as evidenced by the patent granted to Daniel Towers Shears in 1850 (see below) and his subsequent connection with the Glucose Sugar and Colouring Co Ltd.See too the description of the plant recently supplied by Shears and Co to this company given in The Times, 23 January 1867, 14a Premises The company's original premises which were taken over from William Gore were at 67 Fleet Market. The company was still at this address in 1822 (when a fire broke out at the premises described as extending \\"from the west side of the Market to Shoe-lane\\").Morning Chronicle 7 November 1822 By this time Fleet Market was becoming increasingly dilapidated and by 1834 at the very latest Shears & Co had acquired freehold property at 27 Bankside on the Southwark bank of the Thames. This remained their main base for the rest of the company's existence. However, the evidence of contemporary directories and newspaper items shows that during its existence the company occupied other sites in and around London at one time or another including 22–24 Fleet Market (in 1811 where they had a lease on property that was due to expire in 1813); 25 Fleet Market (in 1815); 60 Lower Shadwell (also in 1815). They had copper rolling mills at Merton, Surrey (where they were in possession by 1815 and continued there until 1867): in 1819 they obtained a steam engine to power these mills from Boulton and Watt. In 1867 the company's property included the copperworks, two wharves, an engineering works and other adjacent premises at Bankside, the copper mills at Merton and manufacturing premises at New Park Street, Southwark.This property was all offered for sale in 1867 in the case of Shears v. Dickenson; a detailed list is given in The Times 30 March 1867, p 14a and several subsequent issues Daniel Towers Shears Daniel Towers Shears appears to have been responsible for the day-to-day running of the company by 1810. During his career he took out a number of patents,Bennet Woodcroft, Alphabetical Index of Patentees of Inventions (London, 1854; repr. 1969), pp 512–3 all clearly related to the business of copper and brass manufacture or to industries which used utensils made of these materials: 1817 Machine to cool liquids, e.g. in the process of distillation or brewing. (This has been described as the first true heat-exchanger) 1824 Manufacture of zinc (with his brother James Henry Shears and Frederick Benecke) 1830 Apparatus for distilling (subsequently described as \\"a bad imitation of the Pistorius still\\") 1845 Production of ingots of zinc from ores 1847 Treatment of zinc ores to produce ingots 1850 Manufacture and refining of sugar 1853 Improvements in brewing In 1842 Daniel Towers Shears married his second wife, a Maria Dickenson; at the time he was living at The Lawn, South LambethThe Times 14 January 1842 and this was still his home at the time of his death in 1860. Maria Shears died in 1862.The Times 23 December 1868 p 3c James Henry Shears James Henry Shears, the younger of the two brothers, appears to have had a more adventurous streak than his older brother. In the 1820s, during a period of national economic euphoria, he speculated in a number of concerns which often had little connection with the company's core business. In some of these his brother was also a partner, but probably only in a passive capacity. The first of these was the Real del Monte Company which was formed in 1824 by John Taylor (1779–1863), the mining engineer and entrepreneur,Roger Burt, John Taylor, Mining Engineer and Entrepreneur (Moorland Publishing Co, 1977). to operate silver mines in Mexico. Shears was closely involved and one of the directors of the company. Another company formed by Taylor later in the same year was the British Iron Company: Shears was one of three managing directors, together with Taylor and Robert Small, until 1826 when he was obliged to resign as a result of dissatisfaction among the shareholders at the management of the company.For a history of the company, especially of its activities in north Wales, see Ifor Edwards, 'The British Iron Company', Denbighshire Historical Society Transactions, 31 (1982), 109–48; 32 (1983), 98–124. Also in 1824 Shears formed the Llangennech Coal Company to work the coal under an estate to the east of Llanelli in south Wales. This estate had been leased from Edward Rose Tunno (1800–1863), a rich young man whose income was derived from British and Welsh real estate purchased from his inheritance from his father, John, and uncle Adam, traders of South Carolina. In this concern Shears was joined by his brother and by two London merchants, Thomas Margrave and William Ellwand.M.V. Symons, Coal Mining in the Llanelli Area, vol. 1: 16th Century to 1829 (Llanelli, 1979), pp 121, 164–7. The property included the derelict Spitty copperworks which the Shears brothers (on their own) proceeded to re-open in 1824. The following year, on the opposite bank of the river Llwchwr, they built a new zinc works at Loughor (or possibly re- activated an existing one) where they intended to produce zinc using the recently granted patent of 1824.R.O. Roberts and P.R. Reynolds, 'The Early zinc works at Casllwchwr (Loughor) near Swansea', Morgannwg 48 (2004), pp 5–34. These two enterprises were obviously intended to be complementary to one another in providing the materials required for the manufacture of brass, part of the core business of James Shears & Sons. Shears, Margrave and Tunno further collaborated in acquiring mining property in Cornwall in 1825; Shears is also believed to have had interests in copper mining in north Wales. The copper and zinc works proved unsuccessful. The zinc works was offered for sale in 1825 almost as soon as it had been completed and the copperworks closed in 1831. Copper prices had fallen steeply since 1825 and the Llangennech Coal Company was proving more costly than had been expected since difficulties were being experienced in reaching coal in a new pit that had been started in 1825. Despite this the partners in the Coal Company, with seven others, formed the Llanelly Railway & Dock Co in 1827 to build a new deep-water dock in Llanelli and a railway to connect it to the new pit then in the process of sinking. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1828 (9 Geo. 4 c. xci) but work on the railway and dock did not start until after coal had been proved in the pit in June 1832.M.V. Symons, Coal Mining, pp 121, 167–8. Shortly afterwards, in December 1832, the Shears brothers withdrew from the Coal Company but James Henry Shears retained an interest in the coal industry, becoming involved with the Broadoak colliery at Loughor in 1834. A likely factor contributing to Shears' disengagement from the Llangennech Company was the situation in which the affairs of the British Iron Company were then placed; this must have required much of his attention and finance. Immediately after its formation the company had invested heavily in taking out mineral leases, in setting up new ironworks and in buying new ones. Following dissatisfaction among the shareholders Shears was compelled to resign as a director in 1826 but he continued as one of three trustees of the company's property. The most serious issue concerned the Corngreaves estate near Dudley in the west Midlands for which the company had paid an excessive price at a time of high iron prices in 1825. Following a collapse in the market Shears and his fellow trustees commenced legal action to have the contract revised. The case with appeals lasted from 1826 until 1838; the final result was against the company and led eventually to its collapse. At the time of his death in 1855 James Henry Shears lived at Streatham Hill.  Later history of the Company  Following the death of Daniel Towers Shears a dispute concerning his estate arose between Frances Shears (probably his daughter) and his wife's family, the reasons for which are not clear. His assets were ordered to be sold by the Court of Chancery and a series of sales took place in 1867 of the premises of the company and its stock, stores and equipment.A detailed description of the plant and premises at this date is given in a series of advertisements in The Times 30 March 1867, p 14a, and 5 October 1867, p 12d; the stock of metals etc are detailed in The Times 17 June 1867 p 16d Whatever the outcome of these sales the company continued to trade under its original name and was controlled by Daniel's son William Shears. It remained at 17 and 27 Bankside, described as coppersmiths, engineers and millwrights, until 1891 when a sale of its assets by order of the mortgagees took place.The Times 4 July 1891, p 18e, 3 October 1891, p 14b No subsequent reference to the company has been found.  Daughters of James Shears  As well as his two sons who succeeded to the management of the business, James Shears had several daughters, three of whom married brewers, which demonstrates how close the relationship between coppersmiths and brewers was. Rebecca Shears (1786-1861) was married to James Spurrell (1776–1840) and Hannah Shears (1790–1882) to Charles Spurrell – James and Charles were brothers and members of the Spurrell family of Norfolk; they were also senior employees at the Anchor Brewery, Southwark. As a widow Rebecca married George Cosier Fletcher.Evening Mail 03 December 1841 James Shears's youngest daughter, Lydia (1794–1855), was married to John Gray (1791–1826) of the Gray and Dacre Brewery, West Ham, Essex.Spurrell, J. C., The life of Charles Spurrell and his family's links to the Watney and Gray brewing families, Brewery History No. 138 (December 2010) As further evidence of the close relationship between the coppersmiths of the Shears family and the brewers of the Spurrell family, James Shears's eldest son Daniel Towers Shears married Frances Spurrell, the youngest sister of James and Charles Spurrell (so three Shears siblings married three Spurrell siblings). Furthermore, Rebecca, the eldest daughter of James Spurrell and Rebecca Shears, went on to become the wife of another important brewer, James Watney.

It is owned by the Student Government Association and the Board of Trustees of SRU. It is operated at a \\"rocking\\" 100 watts of power (according to the station's legal sign-off for DJs), serving SRU and the surrounding community. WSRU is run entirely by SRU students. History=News from Thirty-Eight: Closed Circuit Radio In the first semester of 1960, a closed circuit radio station operated on a nightly schedule in Patterson Hall with a power output of less than 1/10 of one watt. This station originated in room 38 of Patterson Hall and broadcast an hour of recorded music and campus news each evening to the three hundred men living in the dorm. The call letters chosen for the station came from the four initial letters of \\"News from Thirty-Eight.\\" Hence the call letters \\"NFTE\\" and its nickname \\"Nifty\\" were adopted. Near the end of the Fall 1960 the transmitting equipment was damaged, and Patterson Hall's radio station went off the air. Several attempts were made to repair the equipment, but the semester came to an end along with the enthusiasm for \\"NFTE\\". WNFT, 1962 - 1980 Slippery Rock State College became a member of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (I.B.S.) in 1961, which it remains a member of today. The college officially requests and is granted a FCC license for a 10 watt broadcast at 640 kHz AM with the callsign WNFT. WNFT operated on a shoestring budget prior to its launch, reporting a total balance of $110 with no transmission or sound equipment or records. The original transmitter and console were hand-built by engineering professors and students. In addition to equipment, they were also procuring records and tapping all free sources known. These sources included 10 to 30 minute spots of music from the armed services. In December 1961, WNFT staff sold \\"Tag Day\\" tickets for $0.25 each to students to continue to raise the funds needed. After two years of cooperative student and faculty efforts, WNFT holds an open house in North Hall. Everyone was invited to view and to hear the new 600 kc., 25 watt Slippery Rock radio station. The broadcast radius covered 3 dormitories. The first official broadcast was at 6:00 p.m., a tape of light classical music performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Despite successfully finding resources to launch, WNFT continues to operate on a shoestring budget, and will do so for many years afterward. Slippery Rock State College opened a new student union building known as the College Union (later renamed University Union) in 1970, and WNFT relocated to a custom-built studio in C-211, where it remains today. University Union was replaced by the Robert M. Smith Student Center in 2013, leaving WSRU as one of the last occupants of University Union. By 1970, WNFT broadcast from 7am to 2am, 7 days a week, utilizing a top 40 rock format mixed with other common radio features (weather, local news, and public affairs programs). WNFT solicited advertisers to move away from their former shoestring budget. WNFT launched the Slippery Rock Radio Network in 1971, broadcasting college sports (both at home and away) live to WNFT, as well as local Butler County and New Castle radio stations. This lasted until the early 1980s, although the station continues to broadcast home football & basketball games live to this day. In 1974, WNFT's news department interviewed Democratic primary candidates Pete Flaherty and Herb Denenberg for Pennsylvania's US Senate election that year. Ironically, the Republican candidate and incumbent Senator in that election, Richard Schweiker, was a two-year attendee of Slippery Rock State College. Schweiker was not invited for an interview. Schweiker went on to win that election and became Secretary of Health and Human Services in 1981. In 1980, WNFT became WRCK to better reflect the modern campus. WRCK, 1980 - 1991 In August 1981, the WRCK staff selected Gregory Beat, Coordinator of Residence Education and Student Activities, to serve as faculty advisor. He led the station based on his previous work and advisory experience with college radio facilities at WIUM, WVKC, and WRKC. During Homecoming weekend 1983, the original version of WSRU goes on the air as an educational station, broadcasting from the 2nd floor of the Eisenberg Classroom Building. The programming consists of \\"block programming,\\" including Jazz, Classical and Orchestral music, Rock, Easy Listening/Soft Rock, Country and Christian themed selections. The Communication Department-run station runs concurrently with the existing WRCK until WSRU ceases operations in 1991. (The license for the original WSRU was later terminated by the FCC in 2006 and then repurchased by WRSK engineer Werner Ullrich, leading to their eventual rebranding.) In 1990, Slippery Rock University installed and activated a campus-wide digital telephone system. This, in effect, eliminates the broadcast of WRCK-AM, as its carrier current AM transmission was dependent on the old analog telephone lines to the campus residence halls. This marks the end of AM broadcasting of any station on Slippery Rock's campus. As a result, WRCK applies for a new license to build a dedicated FM transmitter. The FCC grants the university a construction permit and the callsign WRSK, which becomes active effective November 30. Despite WSRU claiming WNFT as its roots and celebrating a 50-year anniversary in 2012, this legally marks the official foundation of the modern campus radio station. Due to having no dedicated transmission equipment, WRCK is only heard in the lobby of University Union from 1990 to 1991. WRSK, 1991 - 2006 WRSK's first day on-air was September 1, 1991. This ends the station's 30-year history of closed-circuit broadcasting (whether through carrier current AM or locally). The station launched at 8am local time and played The Rolling Stones' Start Me Up to mark the milestone. During the 1992 campaign cycle, California governor and former Democratic presidential candidate Jerry Brown calls and is interviewed by Richard Hart, host of WSRU's only talk radio program, \\"Straight to the Hart.\\" In 2003, DJ Paul Miller interviewed WWE Legend Mick \\"Mankind\\" Foley on the Low Blow Show. Foley then spoke at the University's Union about his time in the WWE. After the license for the WSRU callsign (which had been owned by the university's communications department) expires in 2005, WRSK purchases the license and becomes WSRU-FM effective December 1, 2006. WSRU In 2012, WSRU celebrated their 50th Anniversary of radio at Slippery Rock University. In 2013, a short-lived online feed of WSRU was launched with Integrity 3.0 being the first show to broadcast in this format. However, online streaming would cease three months after launch due to new FCC regulations on the medium. Due to the relatively low range of the station's FM feed, launching a licensed online broadcast becomes a priority. As of October 2018, this has yet to materialize. Despite no longer having a formal news operation, WSRU invites four candidates for Slippery Rock's congressional district to hold an interview on-air prior to the 2018 primary. In October 2018, the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, John Fetterman, was interviewed by WSRU news director Madison V. King. Fetterman would go on to win the election and be sworn in as lieutenant governor on January 15, 2019.

History The original station on this site was a passenger ferry terminal and train station opened in 1852 for the Detroit and Pontiac Railroad. The station was acquired by the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway, and also served the Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana Railroad. The station was destroyed by fire on the evening of April 26, 1866, when someone with a lantern went to inspect a leaking barrel of naphtha being loaded onto a freight car, setting off a chain reaction which also destroyed the ferry boat Windsor moored along the river, killing 17 passengers on the ferry and one person on a passenger train. The second station on the site was a two-story red brick structure opened in 1867 constructed as a union station for the Detroit and Milwaukee, and the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. The Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee began serving the station in 1875. The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern left for Michigan Central Station sometime during or after 1913. The Grand Trunk Western Railroad Detroit-Port Huron trains begin using the Brush Street Station in 1928. Until this time, they terminated at the MC Third Street Station, or the Woodward Avenue Station. The final Grand Trunk Western trains to use the station were the GTW's Mohawk to Pontiac, Durand, South Bend and Chicago's Dearborn Station and unnamed train following the same route. Continuing at the station, past the May 1, 1971 shift of American passenger trains to Amtrak, was the Canadian National Railway's/Grand Trunk's Tempo service from Detroit to Toronto via Windsor and London. The second structure was razed in 1973 to make way for construction of the Renaissance Center. The last station on this site, Franklin Street Station, was built in 1974 approximately a two blocks to the east along St. Antoine Street between Franklin and Atwater streets and used by the SEMTA commuter rail service between Pontiac and downtown Detroit. This simple station consisted of only boarding platforms and a park-and-ride along Atwater Street. The commuter service was discontinued in 1983, and all train service soon thereafter. The site is now the surface parking lot and the rail line to it repurposed as the Dequindre Cut greenway.

Life and career Sculptural details at the top of the 217 ft. column of the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri.Born in San Francisco, California, Aitken studied there at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art [also called the California School of Design – now the San Francisco Art Institute] with Douglas Tilden. From 1901 until 1904 he was an instructor at the Institute. During this period, Aitken in 1900 designed San Francisco's original municipal flag; the design was in use from 1900 until sometime in the early to mid 1930s.John Lumea, \\"The Original San Francisco Flag Was Better and Cooler. Let's Bring It Back!\\" September 12, 2018. In 1903, he sculpted the Victory figure for the top of the Dewey Monument, which still stands in San Francisco's Union Square. In 1904, Aitken moved to Paris where he continued his studies. He returned to New York City after his sojourn in Paris and was employed as an instructor at the Art Students League. Eleanor Mary Mellon was among his pupils. His works include the Science fountain and Great Rivers statues at the Missouri State Capitol, the \\"Iron Mike\\" statue at Parris Island, South Carolina, several military sculptures at West Point and the Temple of Music, and sculptural works for the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. Aitken also produced the \\"Fountain of Earth\\" for San Francisco's Panama Pacific Exposition. Perhaps his most famous work is the West Pediment of the United States Supreme Court building, which bears the inscription \\"Equal Justice Under Law\\". The sculpture, above the entrance to the Supreme Court Building, is of nine figures—Lady Liberty surrounded by figures representing Order, Authority, Council, and Research. These allegorical figures were in fact sculptures of real people who had a role in the creation of the building. Aitken himself is depicted in the pediment, seated to the proper left of Liberty with Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Many of his works were carved by the Piccirilli Brothers, including the pieces for the National Archives Building. Aitken created a stir when he criticized the display and placement of the Venus de Milo. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

He sculpted the $50 gold commemorative (round and octagonal) for the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915, as well as the official medal of the event. He also created the Missouri Centennial half dollar of 1921, following it a decade and a half later with the California Pacific International Exposition half dollar of 1935–1936. In the medallic arena, Aitken sculpted the American Numismatic Society's 1921 medal commemorating Marshal Foch's visit to the United States; the 15th issue of the Society of Medalists Omnia Vincit Amor, 1937; the Medal of the National Academy of Design; and the Medal of the National Sculpture Society.

Leroy Irvis (December 27, 1919 – March 16, 2006) was a teacher, activist and politician based in Pennsylvania; he was the first African American to serve as a speaker of the house in any state legislature in the United States since Reconstruction. (John Roy Lynch (1847–1939) of Mississippi had been the first African American to hold that position.) Irvis, a Democrat, represented Pittsburgh in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1958–1988. Early life Kirkland Leroy Irvis was born in 1919 in Saugerties, New York, son of Francis H. and Harriet Irvis. He attended local schools. He went to college, graduating summa cum laude in 1938 from the University of New York State Teachers College (now State University of New York at Albany) with a master's degree in education, the second black American to graduate from that college. Irvis moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he taught English and history in high schools until World War II. He was hired as a civilian flying instructor in the War Department. Pennsylvania career After World War II, Irvis moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There he worked as the public relations secretary for the local chapter of the Urban League. While with the Urban League, he led a demonstration in 1947 against Jim Crow employment discrimination by Pittsburgh's department stores. This was the first demonstration of its kind in American history. Irvis became an entrepreneur for a time, managing a toy factory and a hot dog stand. In 1950, he left his businesses and pursued blue-collar work in steel mills and road construction, to earn money in order to go to law school. In 1954 he earned a law degree from University of Pittsburgh School of Law. He worked as law clerk to Judge Anne X. Alpern, was hired as Pittsburgh city solicitor, and advanced to become the first black assistant district attorney of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. He supplemented his income as a radio announcer for WILY. When his reputation had grown, he opened a private law practice downtown. Irvis entered politics and was elected as the state representative from Pittsburgh's Hill District, serving in the legislature for 15 straight terms. Rep. Irvis sponsored more than 1600 bills, and is most known for bills promoting civil rights, fair housing, education, public health, highway safety, and modernization of the penal code. In 1977 he was voted unanimously by the representatives for the role of speaker of the house. His most noted achievements include the passage of legislation creating the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency and Equal Opportunity Program, the state's community college system, the Minority Business Development Authority, and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. He is also largely responsible for the Pennsylvania House Ethics Committee, lobbyist registration, and the Legislative Audit Advisory Commission. Honors K.

On March 25, 2013, the Community College of Allegheny County hosted a ceremony for the newly completed K. Leroy Irvis Science Center, named in honor of his work in helping to establish the community college system in Pennsylvania and for his long career of service on behalf of Allegheny County. In 2017, the University of Pittsburgh renamed Pennsylvania Hall, a student residence hall on its upper campus, to the K. Leroy Irvis Hall in his honor. Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman T. J. Rooney described Rep. Irvis as, \\"one of greatest legislative giants that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has ever seen ... [and] one of the most admired and respected Pennsylvanians we'll ever know.\\" Later life Irvis married Katharyne Jones, and they had a son Reginald and daughter Sherri together. Katharyne died in 1958. In 1973 Irvis married Cathryn L. Edwards, who survived him, as do his grown children.

The Pleasant Bay Railway was incorporated in Michigan in March 1898 and purchased the Toledo and Ottawa Beach Railway, an Ohio company incorporated in January 1898, in March 1899. The resulting company was renamed the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line Railroad one month later. It operated a multi-track mainline connecting Detroit, Michigan and Toledo, Ohio, serving several large industries. The main line between the two cities opened in 1903. The Grand Trunk Western Railway (GTW) and the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad (the \\"Clover Leaf\\") co- owned the railroad from 1902-1923. The TStL&W; ownership was transferred to its successor the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (the \\"Nickel Plate Road\\") in 1923 and then to the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;) in 1964. The GTW purchased the N&W;'s interest in the DTS in 1981. At that time the DTS was dissolved and merged into the GTW. Today, a mostly single track section with limited double track and passing sidings of the former mainline continues as the CN/GTW Shore Line Subdivision. History The D&TSL; operated of line between Toledo, Ohio, and Detroit, Michigan, a bridge route connecting the Motor City with the rail gateway of Toledo. Prior to the 1960s mergers resulting in Penn Central Transportation and the Norfolk and Western Railway, the link between these two cities was vitally important to the independent railroads in the area, particularly the GTW and the Nickel Plate. In 1960 it reported 243 million net ton-miles of revenue freight. The D&TSL; was originally incorporated as the Toledo & Ottawa Beach Railway in Ohio and the Pleasant Bay Railway in Michigan. In March 1899 the two companies conveyed all their property to a new company incorporated under the Michigan law as the Detroit & Toledo Shore Line. The intent was to construct the railroad as a high speed interurban connecting link between the Lake Shore Electric at Toledo and interurban lines in Michigan. Immediately following the purchase of the right-of-way, they began the actual grading of the road and construction of the Ottawa River bridge just north of Toledo. From April to December 1901 the road was built from Toledo to Trenton, with trolley wires in place from Monroe to Trenton. Electric cars were tested a few times as far north as Rockwood. The line was still incomplete when its promoters got into serious financial difficulty. The Shore Line went into receivership, and in the summer of 1902 the receiver became convinced that it would never be viable as an electric road and petitioned the court to allow him to construct a connection from the end of the track at Trenton Jct. (FN tower) to the nearby Detroit, Toledo & Ironton (Detroit Southern). This was completed in November 1902 and the construction work ceased for a short period. In December 1902 the Grand Trunk Western and the Toledo, St Louis & Western (known as the Clover Leaf) entered into an agreement to jointly purchase the Shore Line property by issuing bonds for the payment of outstanding obligations. At the same time they contracted to extend the line northward from Trenton to a connection with the Wabash at River Rouge, on the south side of Detroit. The new owners intended to bring the Shore Line up to the same general standards as the Grand Trunk main line, a task that would require considerable additional track work. When the line was completed, the D&TSL; had no equipment except a small locomotive which had been purchased from the contractor and an old dummy saddle tank engine that had formerly run on the New York City elevated. There was some work equipment consisting of Rogers ballast cars but no cabooses or any freight equipment. Only one station had been constructed-at Monroe-but there were few telephone shanties scattered along the road. Early D&TSL; Gang. The overhead wire was removed and sold along with the electric motor cars to the Monroe Traction Company and the Toledo & Monroe Construction Company. The line was opened for freight traffic in September 1903, with each parent company furnishing three locomotives. The D&TSL; used the Clover Leaf terminal in Toledo and the GTW facility in Detroit. There were no passing tracks, no classification yards and no locomotive servicing facilities. To reach the Clover Leaf yard in Toledo they used twelve miles (19 km) of the Toledo Terminal under a trackage rights agreement. In the spring of 1904 they bought six Baldwin compound Moguls along with six cabooses. Work began immediately to upgrade the right-of-way. In 1906 a classification yard-named Lang Yard after the road's auditor was started just north of the Toledo city limits along with a roundhouse, turntable and machine shop. A short time later, work began on another yard at the other end of the railroad: Dearoad Yard was just south of the River Rouge at Detroit. Over the years additional equipment was purchased and many improvements were made as the Shore Line developed into a vital and prosperous property. Ironically, for a road conceived as an interurban, the D&TSL; never handled any passenger traffic, being operated for freight service only. In 1922 the Clover Leaf became part of the Van Sweringen's Nickel Plate, bringing its 50% interest in the D&TSL; under the NKP banner. Through service with the GTW was inaugurated in 1921, and until the early 1940s Shore Line power and crews operated through to Durand and Flint. They also operated through to Tunnel Yard in Port Huron until 1971. Motive power D&TSL; GP7 46, renumbered 76 for the Bicentennial. In the later days of steam the Shore Line operated with a modest fleet of Mikados, Consolidations, and switchers. It brought its first diesels, EMD SW7 switchers 116-118, in April 1950 and followed them with two EMD GP7s each in January, (41,42) and November (43,44) of 1951. A single SW9 (119) was also added in March 1951. Five more GP7s (45-49) were delivered in April 1952, and the last D&TSL; steam locomotive operated in the fall of that year. Two more SW9s (120,121) were added in November 1952, and the Shore Line bought its last new locomotive, GP7 50, on February 12, 1953. With a total fleet of 16 units made up of only three models of the same vintage from the same builder, the D&TSL; shop forces had become quite expert in keeping them running, and the units were extremely well maintained. The three non-m.u.-equipped SW7s were used on locals, transfers and \\"Bum Jobs\\" (extra yard assignments) while the SW9s generally would stay on the hump. The ten Geeps handled transfer and all road assignments. Since power for the road jobs was pooled with the GTW, colorful Geeps, GP38s and SD40s of that road were common sights on Shore Line road jobs and in the Lang Yard engine facility. For the Bicentennial, Shore Line 46 was renumbered 76 and adored in a very handsome red, white and blue paint scheme.

The 15th Division was administratively subordinated to the VI SS Corps, but operationally it was in reserve or at the disposal of the XXXXIII Army Corps, 16th Army, Army Group North. The 19th Division held out in the Courland Pocket until May 1945, the close of World War II, when it was among the last of Nazi Germany's forces to surrender.  Creation  Arm shield of Latvian legionnaires The Latvian Legion was created in January 1943 on the orders of Adolf Hitler following a request by Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS. The initial core of the force was populated by Latvian Police Battalions, which were formed starting in 1941 earlier for security duties. Also, some who had previously served in the notorious Arajs Kommando commando unit,John Hiden.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3020959 One month after the unit was founded, German occupation authorities in Latvia started conscripting military age men. Draftees were given a choice between serving in the Waffen-SS Legions, serving as German Wehrmacht auxiliaries, or being sent to a slave labour camp in Germany. Those who tried to avoid one of those options were arrested and sent to concentration camps. As a result, only 15-20% of the men serving in the legion were actual volunteers. Unlike in Lithuania, potential legionary recruits in Latvia did not organize an official boycott of conscription; some Latvians deserted however rather than serving the Nazi war effort. With Nazi Germany losing the war, conscription was extended to larger and larger numbers of Latvians. The first conscription, in 1943, applied to all Latvian men born from 1919 to 1924. The subsequent conscriptions extended to Latvians born between 1906 and 1928. The division commanders and most of the staff were German SS officers. The individual combat regiments were typically commanded by Latvian officers. After the Red Army broke through German lines at Nevel along the 1st Baltic Front in November 1943, advancing on Latvia, the Latvian Self-Administration took over mobilization from the Germans on November 13. By June 26 there were 7,671 ethnic Russians from Latvia's Latgale, representing ten percent of men from the region, serving in various units of the Latvian Legion. On July 1, 1944 the Latvian Legion had 87,550 men. Another 23,000 Latvians were serving as Wehrmacht \\"auxiliaries\\".  Operational history  The first Latvian Legion unit was the 2nd Latvian SS Brigade, created in February 1943. It fought its first battle in the Siege of Leningrad, opposite the Pulkovo observatory on 18 March 1943. It continued fighting around Leningrad until the German forces retreated in January 1944. The 15th Waffen-SS Division was formed and sent to the front in November 1943. Originally, it was sent to the Ostrov and Novosokolniki districts of Pskov Oblast, but after the German Army suffered setbacks there, was moved to positions in the Belebelka district of Novgorod Oblast in January 1944. It retreated from there a month later. At the end of February 1944, both units took joint defensive positions on the Sorota and Velikaya rivers. At that time, the 2nd Brigade was renamed the 19th Waffen-SS division. Over the next two months, these positions saw intense fighting. In April 1944, the Legion was replaced by other units and moved to less active positions in Bardovo-Kudever, 50 km east of Opochka. It came under attack there in June 1944 and started to retreat on July 10, 1944, crossing the Latvian-Russian border on July 17. In August and September 1944, the 15th Division was moved to Prussia, for replenishment with new recruits. It was in training near Danzig until being ordered into battle on 22 January 1945. At that time, the division consisted of about 15,000 soldiers. It fought near Danzig in January and February, retreating to Pomerania in early March. By early April, the division was reduced to 8,000 men. About 1,000 were sent by sea to replenish the forces in the Courland Pocket, the rest were lost during the fighting. On April 11, the division was told about plans to transfer the entire division to Courland. Seeing that the war was lost and understanding that being sent to Courland would mean eventually having to surrender to the Soviets, the division decided to surrender to the Western Allies instead, disobeying German orders to the contrary, when necessary. The 19th Division continued to fight in Latvia. In October 1944, Soviet advances in Lithuania cut off it and other units in the Courland Pocket from the rest of the German forces. It was a part of the six battles between Soviet and German armies in the Courland Pocket in 1944 and 1945. During the third battle in December 1944, the opposing Soviet units included two Latvian divisions, the 43rd and the 308th, formed from recruits drafted in Soviet-occupied Eastern Latvia. When the Latvian units on both sides of the front faced one another, they were quite unwilling and occasionally disengaged without firing a shot. The Soviet command would transfer the Latvian divisions elsewhere after a few days. Together with other units in the Courland Pocket, the 19th division surrendered to the Soviets at the end of the war on May 9, 1945. Subsequently almost 50,000 Latvian soldiers became Soviet prisoners of war, imprisoned in filtration or Gulag camps. Some of the Legion soldiers continued fighting the Soviets as Forest Brothers for up to ten years after the end of the war.  Motivation of Latvian Legionnaires  Conscription order Oberführer Adolf Ax, commander of the 15th Division, reported on 27 January 1945: \\"They are first and foremost Latvians. They want a sustainable Latvian nation state. Forced to choose between Germany and Russia, they have chosen Germany, because they seek co-operation with western civilization. The rule of the Germans seems to them to be the lesser of two evils.\\" This perspective resulted in part from the Soviet occupation between 1940 and 1941, called \\"The Year of Terror\\" () during which tens of thousands of Latvian families were executed or deported to Siberia with men separated from the women and children to break down resistance.Wingfield, N., Bucur, M. _Gender and war in twentieth-century Eastern Europe_. Indiana University Press, 2006 Legion command emphasized that the Latvians were fighting against Soviet re-occupation. Conscripts promised in the name of God to be subservient to the German military and its commander Adolf Hitler, to be courageous and to be prepared to give up their life \\"in the fight against Bolshevism\\".\\"Dieva vārdā es svinīgi apsolos cīņā pret boļševismu vācu bruņoto spēku virspavēlniekam Ādolfam Hitleram bezierunu paklausību un kā drošsirdīgs karavīrs būšu vienmēr gatavs par šo zvērestu atdot savu dzīvību.\\" per Bangerskis R. Mana mūža atmiņas, vol. 3., Imanta, Copenhagen. 1959. p. 107. Legionnaires hoped to fight off the Red Army until it was no longer a threat to Latvia and then turn against Nazi Germany, as a repeat of the Latvian War of Independence of 1918-1920, when Latvian forces expelled both Bolshevik and German forces. Legionnaires carried Latvian flags under their uniforms as a symbol of that hope.Ezergailis, A. Latvian Legion: Heroes, Nazis, or Victims?: A Collection of Documents From OSS War-Crimes Investigation Files, 1945-1950. Historical Institute of Latvia, 1997. This sentiment was also reflected in one of the most popular Legion songs that went: \\"We'll beat those lice-infested ones – again, again. After that we'll trounce those blue-grays – again, again\\"Mēs sitīsim tos utainos – arvien, arvien, Pēc tam tos zili pelēkos — arvien, arvien (with euphemisms for Bolsheviks and Germans). The Allies confirmed this as early as 1943, when a British investigative mission found Latvians stood against both their Soviet and German occupiers.Strods, Heinrihs. Zem melnbrūnā zobena. Riga, 1994. page 96, fact finding mission of July 5, 1843. Latvians, as did the Estonians and to lesser degree Lithuanians, believed that the Western powers, especially Britain, would come to their aid as they had in 1918-1920. These hopes were bolstered by Allied communications received in November 1944 in which British command instructed them to hold Courland until a joint British-American fleet entered the Baltic.Indulis Ķēniņš, Kam un ko zvērēja latviešu leģionāri? , Crimes Against Humanity, Latvian site, retrieved 12-June-2012. In fact, Churchill and Roosevelt had already privately consigned the Baltics to Stalin. Known Holocaust collaborator police battalion units such as Arājs Kommando were joined to the Legion late in the war as conditions deteriorated on the Eastern Front. That circumstance has been used to accuse the entire Legion of anti-Semitism, Nazi sympathies, and Holocaust war crimes--and modern Latvians commemorating the Latvian Legion of glorifying Nazis.  After World War II  Baltic guards, wearing black uniforms with blue helmets and white belts, guarding Nazi prisoners during the Nuremberg trials In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal declared the Waffen-SS to be a criminal organization, making an exception of people who had been forcibly conscripted. Throughout the post-war years, the Allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the Latvian Legion and the Estonian Legion. The US Displaced Persons Commission in September 1950 declared that: > \\"The Baltic Waffen SS Units (Baltic Legions) are to be considered as > separate and distinct in purpose, ideology, activities, and qualifications > for membership from the German SS, and therefore the Commission holds them > not to be a movement hostile to the Government of the United States.\\" Even before this decision, around 1,000 former Latvian Legion soldiers had served as guards at the Nuremberg trials, guarding Nazi war criminals. Afterwards, during the Berlin Blockade, they took part in securing Allied facilities involved in the Berlin Airlift and later also were guarding USA Army headquarters. During the Soviet period, the Latvian Legion were described as having been illegally conscripted by Nazi Germany in 1943, with no indication of being war criminals or of Holocaust involvement.Latvijas PSR Mazā Enciklopēdija (The Latvian SSR Concise Encyclopedia). Riga: Zinate. 1970, volume II page 326. For example, the Soviet film I remember everything, Richard (also known as Rock and Splinters in its uncut release) made during the 1960s (during the Cold War) at the Riga Film Studio, while being full of Soviet propaganda clichés, clearly illustrates recognition of several essential aspects with respect to Legion soldiers, amongst those: that they were front-line soldiers, they were mostly forcefully conscripted, they were not supporters of Nazi ideology, they did not take part in the Holocaust. This contrasts sharply with Russia's post-Soviet stance, which denounces the Legion as Waffen SS war criminals and uses the Legion issue to assert political and ideological pressure on Latvia on the international scene. In 1946 the coalition government of Sweden led by the Social Democrats, despite strong protests from many sectors of Swedish society, extradited soldiers from the Latvian Legion (also some Estonian Legion and Lithuanian soldiers) who had fled to Sweden and were interned there to the USSR in an event that became known as Baltutlämningen. In the 1990s the Swedish government admitted that this had been a mistake. Surviving Baltic veterans were invited to Sweden in 1994, where they were met by the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden Margaretha af Ugglas and participated in various ceremonies commemorating the events surrounding their extradition. Both the King and the Minister for Foreign affairs expressed their regret for Sweden's past extradition of Baltic Legion soldiers to the Stalinist USSR. Although the position of the defenders of Latvian Legion is quite wide-spread, some scholars stress that there are grounds for supposing that the Latvian Legion possesses all the features of a criminal organization specified at the Nuremberg trials: the conscription procedure into the Legion had certain peculiarities, which do not allow to definitively speak of its compulsory character. Allegations of war crimes  The participation of members of the Latvian fascist movement PērkonkrustsLumans, 2006, pp.239-241. and Holocaust participants, among them 600 members of the Arajs KommandoAndrew Ezergailis, Latvian Legion: heroes, Nazis, or victims? : a collection of documents from OSS war-crimes investigation files, 1945-1950, 1997, p12 in the Legion,Clemens Heni. Riga and Remembering. Journal of for the study of antisemitism (2010) v. 1, p. 159, referring to Operation Winterzauber in 1943. has led Russian authorities to consider the Legion as war criminals. Finnish journalist Jukka Rislakki, on the other hand, in his 2008 book \\"The Case for Latvia: Disinformation Campaigns Against a Small Nation\\" has dismissed such an approach as a \\"typical example of \\"guilt by association\\"\\". It has been claimed that soldiers of the Legion were involved in the Podgaje massacre of Polish POWs in 1945.https://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/EO/article/view/1079 Leanid Kazyrytski has argued that, even though the Nuremberg Tribunal excluded Latvian Waffen SS units from the list of criminal organisations, the Latvian Legion does possess all the features attributed to a criminal organisation by the Nuremberg Tribunal.  Remembrance Day of the Latvian Legionnaires  Remembrance Day of the Latvian Legionnaires, 2008 In the years after the war, 16 March was chosen by the Latvian Legion veterans' organisation in Western exile, , as the day of the Latvian Legion, to commemorate a battle on the eastern shore of the Velikaya River for Hill \\"93,4\\", fought by both 15th and the 19th Waffen-SS divisions. In 1990, Legion veterans started commemorating March 16 in Latvia. In 1998 Latvia's Saeima (parliament) voted this to be an official national remembrance day. The word \\"Legion\\" was, however, excluded from the remembrance day's name, in order to include all those who fought against the Soviets, both during World War II, and as resistance fighters afterwards. International pressure forced the Saeima to remove March 16 from the list of \\"State remembrance days\\" in 2000. March 16 events have been quite confrontational in recent years, with Latvian nationalist organizations (such as All For Latvia! and National Power Unity) marching in support of the Latvian Legion, and predominantly-Russian organizations (For Human Rights in United Latvia) holding protests and attempting to block the marches. Due to a particularly harsh controversy around the official commemoration of the Remembrance Day of the Latvian Legionnaires in 1998, the Latvian officials refrain from its official honoring. Currently, the official position of Latvian authorities is that the Day is a primarily private business of the veterans and their relatives.Eva-Clarita Onken. The Baltic States and Moscow's 9 May Commemoration: Analysing Memory Politics in Europe. Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 59, No. 1 (Jan., 2007), pp. 23-46 Cemetery of Latvian Legion soldiers in Lestene parish On 21 February 2012 The Council of Europe’s Commission against Racism and Intolerance published its report on Latvia (fourth monitoring cycle), in which it condemned commemorations of persons who fought in the Waffen SS and collaborated with the Nazis. ECRI expressed concerns as regards to the authorisation of a gathering, commemorating soldiers who had fought in a Latvian unit of the Waffen SS, that takes place every year on 16 March and is held in the centre of Riga, and expressed dismay at the authorisation by the competent courts of an event set to celebrate the Nazi occupation of Riga (on 1 July). It also expressed concern, that the former Minister of Foreign Affairs had not condemned the march, and on the contrary, supported it. ECRI recommended, that “the Latvian authorities condemn all attempts to commemorate persons who fought in the Waffen SS and collaborated with the Nazis. ECRI further recommends that the authorities ban any gathering or march legitimising in any way Nazism.” On 13 March 2014, UK Labour MEP Richard Howitt, a spokesperson for the European Parliament Human Rights Sub-Committee issued a statement that included the view that \\"Whether local boys were forced to don the SS uniforms or were eager volunteers, celebration of their actions not only insults the memory of the victims but also honours Nazism itself.\\"\\"British MEP Richard Howitt, European Parliament Spokesperson on Human Rights, Issues Statement on Riga Waffen SS march\\" in DefendingHistory.com, 13 March 2014. On his own website, MEP Howitt, citing the Waffen SS marches, criticized the UK Conservative Party for its alliance with nationalist elements in the Latvian government.RichardHowittMEP.com, 16 March 2014.

Without any hopes for the future, he is persuaded by one of his few friends to take part in a \\"summer camp\\"—a secluded rural area in Mendocino County, California-and grow marijuana on a large scale. The illegal business venture seems doomed from the start, but for once Nasmyth decides to prove something to himself and follow through. In the end, after many misadventures, the venture is a failure. At the same time Nasmyth has made the acquaintance of a lovely girl and has fallen in love with her. He ends his narrative on an optimistic note, returning to the girl with plans to \\"plant a little seed\\". Themes Capitalism, male fellowship, drug and alcohol abuse, and the war on drugs are all featured extensively throughout the book. Capitalism Capitalism in the North American tradition is examined throughout the book - although mostly from an illegal business framework. The book specifically focuses on the ironic use of capitalism by society's subversive elements. The financier of the project, Vogelsang, is described as an apprentice to Andrew Carnegie or Jay Gould, and involved in various investments and trading of commodities. Vogelsang's agricultural expert, Boyd Dowst, is described as an optimistic Yankee farmer with a Master's degree from Yale. The opening two epigraphs quote Benjamin Franklin and the Death of a Salesman. A water pipeline, central to the survival of the group's crop and enterprise, comes under attack at various points in the book from a neighbor and a bear. At one point, the proprietor of an illegal glory-hole-based sexual business is described with great similarity to J. P. Morgan - his rosacea, his affinity for cigars, his cane, and a copy of The Wall Street Journal. In another passage, Felix expands upon the group's beliefs in and possible disillusionment with - if the project fails - the principles of the classless society, upward mobility, and the law of the jungle. The war on drugs The authorities are largely symbolized by the California Highway Patrol, and are one of the many threats to the group's illegal enterprise. Felix's paranoid thoughts focus on Officer Jerpbak, with whom he has several hostile and unrelated encounters throughout. The book is set during the high profile war on drugs in Northern California administered by George Deukmejian in the early 1980s. Book information Budding Prospects by T. C.

(This is an early example of the use of the term \\"humanized antibody\\".) The process of \\"humanization\\" is usually applied to monoclonal antibodies developed for administration to humans (for example, antibodies developed as anti-cancer drugs). Humanization can be necessary when the process of developing a specific antibody involves generation in a non- human immune system (such as that in mice). The protein sequences of antibodies produced in this way are partially distinct from homologous antibodies occurring naturally in humans, and are therefore potentially immunogenic when administered to human patients (see also Human anti-mouse antibody). There are other types of antibodies developed. The International Nonproprietary Names of humanized antibodies end in -zumab, as in omalizumab (see Nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies). Humanized antibodies are distinct from chimeric antibodies. The latter also have their protein sequences made more similar to human antibodies, but carry a larger stretch of non-human protein.  Use of recombinant DNA in humanization process  The humanization processes takes advantage of the fact that production of monoclonal antibodies can be accomplished using recombinant DNA to create constructs capable of expression in mammalian cell culture. That is, gene segments capable of producing antibodies are isolated and cloned into cells that can be grown in a bioreactor such that antibody proteins produced from the DNA of the cloned genes can be harvested en masse. The step involving recombinant DNA provides an intervention point that can be readily exploited to alter the protein sequence of the expressed antibody. The alterations to antibody structure that are achieved in the humanization process are therefore all effectuated through techniques at the DNA level. Not all methods for deriving antibodies intended for human therapy require a humanization step (e.g. phage display) but essentially all are dependent on techniques that similarly allow the \\"insertion\\" or \\"swapping-out\\" of portions of the antibody molecule.  Distinction from \\"chimeric antibody\\"  chimeric (top right), humanized (bottom left) and chimeric/humanized (bottom middle) monoclonal antibodies. Human parts are shown in brown, non-human parts in blue. Humanization is usually seen as distinct from the creation of a mouse-human antibody chimera. So, although the creation of an antibody chimera is normally undertaken to achieve a more human-like antibody (by replacing constant region of the mouse antibody with that from human) simple chimeras of this type are not usually referred to as humanized. Rather, the protein sequence of a humanized antibody is essentially identical to that of a human variant, despite the non-human origin of some of its complementarity-determining region (CDR) segments responsible for the ability of the antibody to bind to its target antigen. Chimeric antibody names contain a -xi- stem. Examples of chimeric antibodies approved for human therapy include abciximab (ReoPro), basiliximab (Simulect), cetuximab (Erbitux), infliximab (Remicade) and rituximab (MabThera). There are also several examples of chimerics currently in clinical trials (e.g. bavituximab, see sortable list for additional examples).  Humanizing via a chimeric intermediate  The humanization process may, however, include the creation of a mouse-human chimera in an initial step (mouse variable region spliced to human constant region). Thereafter the chimera might be further humanized by the selective alteration of the sequence of amino acids in the variable region of the molecule. The process must be \\"selective\\" to retain the specificity for which the antibody was originally developed. That is, since the CDR portions of the variable region are essential to the ability of the antibody to bind to its intended target, the amino acids in these portions cannot be altered without the risk of undermining the purpose of the development. Aside from the CDR segments, the portions of the variable regions that differ from those in humans can be corrected by exchanging the appropriate individual amino acids. This is accomplished at the DNA level using mutagenesis. Naming of humanized chimeras includes the stem for both designations (-xi- + -zu-). Otelixizumab is an example of a humanized chimera currently in clinical trials for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus.Clinical Trials page list for otelixizumab  Humanization by insertion of relevant CDRs into human antibody \\"scaffold\\"  It is possible to produce a humanized antibody without creating a chimeric intermediate. \\"Direct\\" creation of a humanized antibody can be accomplished by inserting the appropriate CDR coding segments (so-called 'donor', responsible for the desired binding properties) into a human antibody \\"scaffold\\" (so-called 'acceptor'). As discussed above, this is achieved through recombinant DNA methods using an appropriate vector and expression in mammalian cells. That is, after an antibody is developed to have the desired properties in a mouse (or other non-human), the DNA coding for that antibody can be isolated, cloned into a vector and sequenced. The DNA sequence corresponding to the antibody CDRs can then be determined. Once the precise sequence of the desired CDRs are known, a strategy can be devised for inserting these sequences appropriately into a construct containing the DNA for a human antibody variant. The strategy may also employ synthesis of linear DNA fragments based on the reading of CDR sequences. Alemtuzumab is an early example of an antibody whose humanization did not include a chimeric intermediate. In this case, a monoclonal dubbed \\"Campath-1\\" was developed to bind CD52 using a mouse system. The hypervariable loops of Campath-1 (that contain its CDRs and thereby impart its ability to bind CD52) were then extracted and inserted into a human antibody framework. Alemtuzumab is approved for treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemiaDrugBank entry for alemtuzumab and is currently in clinical trials for a variety of other conditions including multiple sclerosis.Clinical Trials pages for alemtuzumab  Antibodies for human therapy derived without using mice  There are technologies that completely avoid the use of mice or other non-human mammals in the process of discovering antibodies for human therapy. Examples of such systems include various \\"display\\" methods (primarily phage display) as well as methods that exploit the elevated B-cell levels that occur during a human immune response.  Display methods  These employ the selective principles of specific antibody production but exploit micro- organisms (as in phage display) or even cell free extracts (as in ribosome display). These systems rely on the creation of antibody gene \\"libraries\\" which can be wholly derived from human RNA isolated from peripheral blood. The immediate products of these systems are antibody fragments, normally Fab or scFv). This means that, although antibody fragments created using display methods are of fully human sequence, they are not full antibodies. Therefore, processes in essence identical to humanization are used to incorporate and express the derived affinities within a full antibody. Adalimumab (Humira) is an example of an antibody approved for human therapy that was created through phage display.  Antibodies from human patients or vaccine recipients  It is possible to exploit human immune reaction in the discovery of monoclonal antibodies. Simply put, human immune response works in the same way as that in a mouse or other non-human mammal. Therefore, persons experiencing a challenge to their immune system, such as an infectious disease, cancer or a vaccination are a potential source of monoclonal antibodies directed at that challenge. This approach seems especially apt for the development of anti-viral therapies that exploit the principles of passive immunity. Variants of this approach have been demonstrated in principle and some are finding their way into commercial development.http://www.theraclone- sciences.com/pdf/Theraclone_ISTAR.pdf Example of method using human patients as source of monoclonal antibodies See also * List of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies References .

She is the lead ship of the and has one sister ship of an improved design, . The ship entered service in 1968 and participated in the two last Cod Wars against the United Kingdom. Ægir primarily conducts patrols, search and rescue, fishery inspections, general law enforcement and counter-terrorism operations in the Icelandic exclusive economic zone. Description Ægir has a standard displacement of and at full load. The ship measures long with a beam of and a draught of . The ship is powered by two MAN 8L 40/54 diesel engines turning two shafts with Kamewa controllable pitch propellers rated at . This gives the ship a maximum speed of with a range of at . The vessel has a 20-ton bollard-pulling winch and passive rolling tanks. The Ægir-class ships were initially armed with a Hotchkiss cannon. However, these weapons were replaced in 1990 with the Bofors /L60 autocannon, which in turn was replaced with the 40 mm Bofors L70 in the late 2000s. Among other weapons equipped include net cutters, which the Icelandic Coast Guard used during the Cod Wars. A large crane is situated forward of the helicopter deck. Ægir mounts Sperry surface search and navigational radar. The vessel sports a helicopter deck aft and a hangar located between the funnels. In 1997, the helicopter deck was extended. The ship has a complement of 19. Construction and career The order of a new vessel to be constructed for the Icelandic Coast Guard (ICG) was projected in February 1965. The keel for the ship was laid down in May 1967 by Aalborg Værft in Denmark and the ship was launched that same year. Named for a character in Norse mythology, the ship was completed in 1968 and entered service with the ICG the same year. Ægir primarily conducts patrols, search and rescue, fishery inspections, general law enforcement and counter-terrorism operations in the Icelandic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Cod Wars Ægir took part in the Second Cod War from 1 September 1972 to 8 November 1973. The Cod Wars began after Iceland extended its EEZ from from the coast to and disallowed other nations to fish within those limits. Traditionally other European nations, including the United Kingdom and West Germany fished in the area for cod. In the late 1950s, Icelandic Coast Guard ships attempted to drive off fishing trawlers which led escalation and the intervention of the British Royal Navy. In 1961, the two sides made peace and allowed British ships in Icelandic waters at certain times of the year. Before this could be completely settled in international courts, a second confrontation began. Iceland expanded its EEZ again, this time to . ICG vessels were deployed to chase unlicensed fishing trawlers out of the new limit. On 2 September 1972, Ægir chased 16 trawlers out of the EEZ. This led to the Royal Navy creating a special patrol that would stay just outside of the new limit. While awaiting the court's decision, the ICG had armed all of its trawlers with net cutters. If a fishing trawler refused to leave the area, the ICG ships would come up astern of the fishing trawler at a right angle and using the net cutter, cut the fishing vessel's nets. The loss of the nets and the catch within was an expensive proposition for the fishermen, so they began to work together to prevent the ICG vessels from cutting their nets. Some of the fishing trawlers tried to prevent the ICG from cutting their nets by ramming the ICG ships. On 12 September Ægir cut the nets of the fishing trawlers Lucinda and Wyre Victory. On 23 January 1973 the volcano Eldfell on the island of Heimaey erupted and the ICG ships were withdrawn to aid in the rescue of the island's citizens. They returned on 5 May. In the meantime, the British had chartered two tugboats to help defend the fishing trawlers within Iceland's EEZ. In March Ægir fired upon the trawlers Brucella and St Leger in separate incidents. By 17 May, the ICG vessels had fired upon the trawlers 12 more times, which led them to demand Royal Navy assistance. The Royal Navy entered the area and the trawlers began to fish in boxes of four. On 26 May Ægir fired upon the trawler Everton, nearly sinking it. With the arrival of the Royal Navy, the ICG vessels began interactions with the frigates and Ægir had three separate significant collisions with British frigates; on 1 June with on 17 July with and on 29 August with . The final collision resulted in the death of an ICG sailor, the only casualty of the Cod Wars. On 3 October, Ægir collided with the frigate Lincoln again, this time recorded by a television crew. The Icelandic government threatened to break off diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom, which led to the withdrawal of Royal Navy vessels from the area on 3 October. The de-escalation led to a treaty that allowed access to the area for British fishermen, but only in smaller trawlers. The Third Cod War began after Iceland extended its EEZ to in November 1975. ICG vessels began net cutting operations again, with Ægir cutting the nets of Wilber Wilberforce on 25 November and Boston Comanche on 3 December. On 3 January, even with a Royal Navy presence in the area, Ægir managed to cut the nets of two trawlers. The Third Cod War became the most hazardous as the Royal Navy moved to prevent the ICG vessels from cutting nets or arresting trawlers, such as the case of Ægir and the fishing vessel Primella. There were 50 collisions, with the last being Ægir with the frigate on 26 May. The ICG vessels managed to cut 41 nets. The Third Cod War ended on 31 May. Modernisation In 1994, a crane was fitted in Ægir forward of the helicopter deck on the starboard side. In 1997, the ship underwent a refit that extended its helicopter deck and installed a radome atop the ship. In 2005, Ægir underwent a refit in Poland that improved the bridge and accommodations along with the installation of in-flight refuelling equipment for the helicopters.

Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, it reaches a height of , is long, and reaches a maximum speed of . The roller coaster features a vertical loop, an Immelmann loop, and a zero-gravity roll. Dæmonen replaced Slangen, a family roller coaster, and officially opened on 16 April 2004. A record number of guests attended the park that year, but the public has since given the ride mixed reviews. History The plans to build the roller coaster, then nameless, was announced in August 2003, to replace Slangen. The idea had been three years in the making and Tivoli had held a procurement involving four roller coaster manufactures, with Bolliger & Mabillard being chosen to build the new roller coaster. With a total cost of 75 million DKK (€10 million), the attraction was at the time Tivoli's biggest investment in modern times, and the most expensive roller coaster in Denmark. It was named Dæmonen in January 2004. Slangen, Tivoli Gardens's family roller coaster, closed on 21 September 2003 to make room for Dæmonen. Once the roller coaster was demolished, construction for the new roller coaster commenced. By the beginning of December, most of the brake run and station portions of the track were erected. By the new year, the lift hill was topped off. The first drop was completed by the end of January 2004 and the last piece of track was placed in February. It opened on 16 April that year, and was sponsored by Mazda for its first three years in operation. On 14 July 2007, Dæmonen got stuck during a ride, and the passengers would have to wait an hour before they could be released by the fire department. On 20 July 2008, the ride stopped 25 meters above the ground, and 24 passengers were evacuated via built-in stairs. The latter incident was caused by a loose connection in an electronic sensor, which triggered the emergency brakes. On 6 April 2017 an optional, up-charge virtual reality experience was added to the ride. Utilising Samsung VR headsets, the graphics depict scenes of dragons, demons, and other elements from Chinese mythology. Ride experience After riders have boarded and the station floor is retracted, the train begins to climb the chain lift hill. Once at the top, the train makes an approximate 180-degree downward left turn followed by an upward right turn. Following the turn, the train enters the main drop reaching a top speed of leading directly into a vertical loop. The train then immediately goes through an Immelmann loop. Next, the train makes a slightly banked right turn into a zero-gravity roll. After an upward left turn, then another right turn, the train rises up leading into the final brake run. The train then makes a 180-degree left turn leading back to the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 1 minute and 46 seconds. Characteristics=Track The steel track of Dæmonen is approximately long, and the height of the lift is high. The track was designed by Bolliger & Mabillard and is filled with sand to reduce the noise made by the trains. Also, the track is painted red while the supports are silver. Trains Dæmonen operates with two steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides in a single row, for a total of 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over the shoulder restraint. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,200 riders per hour. The structure of the trains are colored orange; the seats and restraints are black. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Dæmonen has no floor on its trains. Reception Mia Christensen and Andreas Veilstrup from B.T. said that the ride was fantastic and that it has lived up to its name. Ethan Williams from Daily Mail said, \\"the fun didn't last long enough for me\\", and gave Dæmonen two out of five for speed and surprise factor, three out of five for fear factor, and a three out of five overall. After the first year of the roller coaster's operation, Tivoli Gardens announced that a record 3,346,000 guests attended the park in the 2004 season; however, attendance dropped 186,000 the following year.

Geography  Emlichheim lies right on the German-Dutch border. The community is bordered on the south by the river Vechte and on the north by the Coevorden-Picardy Canal. It is the administrative seat of the Samtgemeinde Emlichheim, whose members also include Hoogstede, Laar and Ringe. Over the last few years the village has experienced massive growth due to the inflow of Dutch nationals.  History  Emlichheim has existed at least since Charlemagne’s time. In a document from 1312, the community crops up under the name Emminchem. In old Dutch documents (16th to 19th century), and even today in the Low Saxon dialects, Emlichheim is called Emmelkamp.Copy of an old Dutch book about the history of the County of Bentheim  Politics = Municipal council  Council’s current composition (19 seats in total): * CDU - 8 seats * SPD - 7 seats * FDP - 2 seats * Grafschafter Bürger Forum (gbf) - 2 seats (State: municipal election by 11. September 2011)  Partner communities  * Genemuiden, Netherlands since about 1975 * Grabów nad Prosną, Poland since 2006  Economy  The firm Emsland-Stärke, with its location in Emlichheim, is one of Europe’s starch producers. Over a million metric tons of potatoes delivered from within a region with a radius of some 150 km are processed here every year, thereby making Emsland-Stärke the community’s largest employer. Some 8 km west of Emlichheim lies the border-straddling industrial park within the communities of Laar in Germany and Coevorden in the Netherlands called EUROPARK. Here, a hotly disputed rubbish burning site, the Müllverbrennungsanlage Emlichheim, is supposed to be built by a private Dutch investor. Another economic factor of the Emlichheim Samtgemeinde is the plastics processing industry. Among these businesses are Synco and BekuPlast in Ringe and Ringoplast in Ringe-Neugnadenfeld.  Education  Emlichheim has a primary school, a Hauptschule-Realschule, a Gymnasium for secondary level 1 and a special school. These schools supply basic educational needs, but further needs must be sought either in Neuenhaus (Lise-Meitner-Gymnasium) or in the district seat of Nordhorn.

Neuenhaus lies on the rivers Dinkel and Vechte near the border with the Netherlands and is roughly 10 km northwest of Nordhorn, and 30 km north of Enschede. History Neuenhaus was founded in 1317 on the trade road between Münster and Amsterdam by Bentheim’s Count Johannes II, who also had a castle built for its security. The quickly growing new town was granted town rights in 1369. The town had at its disposal an Amt court and other authorities that were moved to the district seat of Nordhorn after the Second World War. Today’s town of Neuenhaus was enlarged in 1970 through the amalgamation of the formerly autonomous communities of Grasdorf, Hilten and Veldhausen, the last of which had already existed as early as the 10th century. By building two weirs on the Vechte and another on the river Dinkel, the flooding that had so often beset Neuenhaus in earlier years was brought under control. The main street through Neuenhaus’s inner town has been dismantled since 2005 after a southwest bypass was built around the town. Many old Ackerbürgerhäuser (roughly \\"gentleman farmers’ houses\\") have been or are being renovated. The town is especially interesting when explored by bicycle. The cycling paths are very well signposted (a roughly 250 km network throughout the district) and lead through meadows and woods as well as alongside the rivers Vechte and Dinkel. There are always more and more artistic projects along the paths to look at. Furthermore, the local gymnastic and sport club (known locally as the \\"TuS\\", for \\"Turn- und Sportverein\\"), linked below, is celebrating its 100-year jubilee. Veldhausen The outlying centre of Veldhausen is actually a more-than-1000-year-old parish village that has been amalgamated with the town of Neuenhaus since 1970. Nonetheless, Veldhausen has been able to keep some of its autonomy. There are roughly 2,200 villagers. Veldhausen arose when farmers from the nearby communities of Esche, Grasdorf and Osterwald expressed a wish to have a place for their own new church, as it was too far for many to go to the church in Uelsen, and indeed even impossible in bad weather. Thus, a centrally located plot of unproductive land was sought, of the kind once known locally by the Dutch word veld, meaning \\"field\\" (Dutch was still used in officialdom in Veldhausen no more than 100 years ago). The first church is believed to have been built mainly of wood. Around this church over time settled craftsmen and gentleman farmers (Ackerbürger). Today’s stone Evangelical-Reformed church, along with the windmill and neighbouring mill park, counts itself among Veldhausen’s landmarks. On the mill park grounds, the Brauchtum- und Mühlenverein – Tradition and Mill Club – have built an old miller’s house and a bakehouse. In the bakehouse, hobby bakers bake bread made out of the flour ground at the mill. Politics The current town council’s seats are apportioned thus: * CDU: 13 seats * SPD: 11 seats * Bündnis 90/Die Grünen: 1 seat The town’s mayor is Paul Mokry. Coats of arms Neuenhaus’s arms might heraldically be described thus, although the wavy bend parting is considered to be unheraldic: Party per bend wavy sinister, in gules a war tent argent surmounted by a crown argent, in the chief sinister four orbs Or, in Or a house gules with stepped gables and tower on the peak of the roof. The greater charge in the red part of the shield is a Dutch baron’s war tent, and the four orbs next to it stand for the Counts of Bentheim. The house with stepped gables is a charge taken from the town’s seal, borne since 1400. =Veldhausen= Veldhausen’s arms Veldhausen’s arms likewise show a war tent with a baronial crown over it, referring to Dutch Commander Carl von Rabenhaupt, Baron at Sucha, whose headquarters in 1673-1674, in his campaign against Christoph Bernhard von Galen, Prince-Bishop of Münster, were in Veldhausen. Transport Neuenhaus lies on Bundesstraße 403 running from Nordhorn into the Netherlands. There is further a railway link following roughly the same route; however, there had been no passenger service on the line since the mid-1970s, although the line still handled goods.

History  Adams Island was originally part of Tuckernuck Island. During the 1890s, the westernmost part of Tuckernuck extended almost to Muskeget Island and served as a barrier beach, protecting the Gravel Islands, western Dry Shoal, and Little Gull Island. The island came into existence in 1902, when the Haulover Nor'easter severed it from Tuckernuck. Another island, Tombolo, was also created. In 1907, Adams almost attached itself to Muskeget, but failed to do so because the sea formed a narrow deep channel separating Adams from Muskeget. In 1910, Adams' length was shortened due to a tropical storm and an autumn nor'easter. By 1920, Adams was less than four hundred meters long. A little less than ten meters of it remained in 1950, and by 1980 it was gone.  Adams Island Day  In 1983, a group of Nantucket residents, self- designated as Adamites, held a small celebration in honor of the former island. The first Adams Island Celebration was characterized by a nihilist/absurdist spirit emphasizing the short existence of the island and downplaying its disappearance. The celebration has taken place in some form each year since 1983, and although it rarely falls on the same day as in the previous year, it is known each year to Adamites as Adams Island Day. By boat, one can easily access Tuckernuck from Madaket on the island of Nantucket.

He was of mixed Kurdish-Turkish origin and often identified himself as a \\"Kurd of Turkey\\". Awards ceremony incident On 10 February 1999 during the televised annual music awards ceremony, Show TV, at which he was to be named Musician of the Year, Kaya said that he wanted to produce music in his native language, as he was of Kurdish background. He also announced that he had recorded a song in Kurdish (Karwan, released on the Hoşçakalın Gözüm album in 2001) and intended to produce a video to accompany it. Following this announcement, he faced massive opposition from Turkish people and celebrities in the event. First, Serdar Ortaç started singing a song with modified lyrics to boost nationalist feelings, then people in the ceremony started singing 10th Year March. Later, Kaya was attacked by celebrities. Kaya's wife describes the attack as \\"All of a sudden, all of those chic women and men, they all turned into monsters, grabbing forks and knives and throwing them at us, insulting, booing. Imagine the atmosphere changing in just five minutes, almost a Kafkaesque transformation.\\" Exile and death The incident led to a prosecution case which made him leave Turkey. In March 2000 he was sentenced in absentia to three years and nine months in prison on the charge of spreading separatist propaganda. Later, however, the mass media allegation showing Kaya in front of the poster was proven to be forged. He died from a heart attack in Paris in 2000, at the age of 43, and is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. He is buried in item number 71.

In 1834, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada representing Grenville as a Reformer. Although he was reelected in 1836, he travelled to England to protest the interference by Sir Francis Bond Head in the election. He wrote Canadiana: containing sketches of Upper Canada, and the crisis in its political affairs, which described radical Reform policies of the time. He did not involve himself in the Upper Canada Rebellion; however, allegations of his involvement with William Lyon Mackenzie's Patriots led to his expulsion from the assembly. In 1851, he was appointed district court judge in Kent County. He retired from the bench in 1878. He contributed articles on law and sport to various periodicals in Canada and the United States.

It broadcast from 1972 to 1992. A total of 113 shows were made, six per year. It was sent at first from the Friedrichstadtpalast theatre, and later from the Palast der Republik, as well as from other prominent music halls in other East German cities. Its title sequence showed a series of famous clocks in East Berlin, such as that on the Rotes Rathaus and the Weltzeituhr at Alexanderplatz displaying the time of broadcast, 8 p.m. (scheduled to clash with the main evening news on ARD) Ein Kessel Buntes was originally hosted by actors Horst Köbbert (who spoke Low German from the north), Lutz Stückrath (a speaker of the Berlin dialect), and Manfred Uhlig (who spoke Saxon from the south), whose satirical commentary during the live broadcasts often criticised the East German government. They were soon replaced by a rotating cast of celebrities. The show was meant to compete with those on West German television (which most East Germans were able to receive, and often watched). To this end it was fairly successful even attracting a following in parts of West Germany which could receive Eastern TV. Its production values were high. Apart from song and dance numbers and appearances from East German celebrities, almost every broadcast featured well-known stars from the west, often after their popularity had peaked in their home countries. After German reunification, and the dissolution of Fernsehen der DDR, the concept and name of the program were taken over by ARD and broadcast on Das Erste, following the main news programme Tagesschau. In its final two years of \\"Ein Kessel Buntes\\", Karsten Speck hosted the show on January 12, 1991, a total of ten times. At one time, Frank Schöbel moderated the program. The last show ran on 19 December 1992. It is still popular in reruns and best- of shows. Numerous international stars were invited to participate: ABBA, Amanda Lear, Bad Boys Blue, Dalida, Karel Gott, Dara Rolins, Helena Vondráčková, Zsuzsa Koncz, Alla Pugacheva, Sofia Rotaru, Kati Kovács and others.

The society operated across Yorkshire, the North West and North Midlands of United Kingdom. In September 2002, it came about from the merger of United NorWest and Yorkshire Co-operative Society. United Norwest, in turn, arose from the Norwest Pioneers, which had the Rochdale Pioneers as a direct predecessor. Rochdale Pioneers was the prototypical consumer co-operative, formed in 1844. The key businesses of the Society were food retailing, travel retail, car dealerships (Sunwin Motor Group), pharmacies and funerals. The underperforming non-food department stores, most of which were inherited via Yorkshire Co-operatives, were closed or sold-off. The former Normid chain of superstores was owned by the society. United's pharmacies and food stores had a distinct logo, that was not to be confused with the Co-operative Group's own chain of pharmacies and food stores, which adopt a slightly different logo and fascia. However, after the merger former United sites adopted the new branding. In September 2006, members voted for a merger with the smaller Sheffield Co-operative Society, giving United a greater presence in South Yorkshire. On 11 December 2006, members voted for a merger with Leeds Co-operative Society, which has similar statistics to Sheffield Co-op; this was confirmed with a second vote in January 2007.http://www.united.coop/NewsLeeds.asp On 29 July 2007, the two completed the merger. Later in 2007, United Co-operatives merged with the Co- operative Group and ceased to exist as an independent society. Normid Normid was the name the United Co-operatives used for their largest stores, located in Northern England. Normid superstores sold food, DIY products, electrical items and housed concessions such as Dolphin bathrooms. By the time of United's merger with the Co-operative Group, the business had decided to concentrate on smaller stores and supermarkets and planned to rebrand the remaining stores as 'The Co-operative Food'. The flagship Normid store was at Burnden Park, Bolton, home of Bolton Wanderers Football Club and Normid was shirt sponsor of Bolton Wanderers from 1986 until 1990. However United Co- operatives objected legally to any development or modernisation of the stadium ultimately forcing Bolton Wanderers to move away from the site. The store closed in 1997, shortly after Bolton's move to the Reebok Stadium. The site was derelict for several years and demolished in 2001, to make way for a new retail park, including an Asda Superstore. Other stores were located in Blackpool, Crewe, Wigan, Widnes, St Helens, Talke (near Kidsgrove), Chorley, Hindley and Blackburn.

Geography The community of Uelsen lies in westernmost Lower Saxony, on the border with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, roughly 30 km north of Enschede and 15 km northwest of Nordhorn. History * About 690: The groundwork for the great parish of Uelsen was laid, probably by the missionary Willibrord. * 1131: Uelsen was first mentioned in a document by the Bishop of Utrecht. At that time, Uelsen belonged to Twente (now in the Netherlands), which then belonged to the German Empire, as did Utrecht. * About 1300: The castle of the Count ten Tooren or von Thurn stood in Uelsen. (The castle's remains were used in the mid-19th century as a synagogue.) * 1312: Ownership of Uelsen passed to the Count of Bentheim. * 1544: The Lutheran creed was introduced to Uelsen. Start of the Reformation. * 1546: Under Emperor Charles V, border crossings were sealed and Uelsen was cut off from the Netherlands. * 1580: Heavy fighting in the Uelsen woods in the Dutch Revolt between the Spanish and the Dutch. * 1588: The Reformed creed was introduced. * 1597: The Reformation ended. * 1618 to 1648: The Thirty Years' War. The County of Bentheim (Grafschaft Bentheim) was supposedly neutral ground, but the people suffered great hardships. Münster, Lüneburg, Hessian and Swedish troops all moved into billets in the Uelsen community and extorted board and the people’s last belongings. * 1636: As a result of the war and widespread hunger, the plague broke out. * 1650: The town hall was built. * 1655: Bernhard von Galen, Bishop of Münster, waged war against Holland. Again fighting troops marched through the County. * 1666: Bernhard von Galen concluded the Peace of Nordhorn. * 1672: The Bishop of Münster once again attacked the Netherlands after only six years’ peace. * 1688: Count Ernst Wilhelm converted to the Catholic faith. The Reformed clergy he then also had replaced by Catholic clergy. The County pastors turned to the Netherlands, Dutch became the church’s language, and until the late 19th century, it was also used in schools. Church hymns were still partly being sung in Dutch as late as 1933. * 1756 to 1763: The Seven Years' War. * 19th century: The population figures fell from 1200 to 806 as working-class families moved to Nordhorn or Schüttorf to find work in the textile industry. Some families also moved to the Netherlands or America. * 1921: An electric company was founded. * 1929 to 1931: A water supply system was built. * 1933 to 1945: Uelsen and its outlying centres were NSDAP strongholds. * 1974: Uelsen became the seat of the Joint Community (Samtgemeinde) of Uelsen, to which also belong the communities of Getelo, Gölenkamp, Halle, Itterbeck, Wielen and Wilsum. * 31 December 2004: The Regierungsbezirk of Weser-Ems, which Uelsen belonged to, was abolished after administrative reform. * 2006: Uelsen marked its 875 years of existence with a festival week. The state-recognized health resort of Uelsen is the Joint Community’s middle point and at the same time its seat. Partner town Uelsen’s partner town is Tubbergen in the Netherlands.

Located in Brooklandville, Maryland, the school sits on a rural campus in the Green Spring Valley Historic District, about ten miles (16 km) north of the city of Baltimore in suburban Baltimore County. St. Paul's shares a campus with St. Paul's Pre and Lower School (coed, six weeks through grade 4) and with St. Paul's School for Girls (reestablished in 1959 after a 19th-century predecessor became defunct). In July 2018, the schools unified under the umbrella of The St. Paul's Schools, with a single board of trustees and one president, but each school retains its individual traditions and its gender- specific programs. St. Paul's was founded in February 1849 at Old St. Paul's Parish in Baltimore City by the Reverend William Edward Wyatt, rector. Throughout its history, St. Paul's has moved its campus five times, finally residing at the current grounds in 1952. The focal point building on the Brooklandville campus is \\"Brooklandwood,\\" a mansion built in 1793 by Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737-1832), one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence for Maryland, the wealthiest man in America at the time, and a devout Roman Catholic. The building was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1972. Chapin Hall for middle-school boys Academics=Early Years The Chapel in 1898 At the time of the school's founding in the mid nineteenth century, boys studied Greek, Latin, and math. The practice of church music was also given high priority, starting with the creation of the Men and Boys’ Choir of Old St. Paul's Church in 1873. Today St. Paul's offers a college-preparatory curriculum for students in the Upper School (grades 9-12). St. Paul's is known for its small class sizes, collegial student-teacher relationships, global programs, and strong focus on character development. The school offers the intensive IB Diploma Program, which develops critical thinking and communication skills St. Paul's also offers courses in theater, concert chorale, digital arts, and visual arts, many of which are cross-registered with the neighboring St. Paul's School for Girls. Boys from St. Paul's School also have the opportunity to take Advanced Placement courses at the girls' school. Athletics Middleton Athletic Center, St. Paul's St. Paul's places a strong emphasis on athletics. Despite the school's small class sizes of roughly 70 students per class year, the school supports varsity teams in football, soccer, volleyball, cross-country, wrestling, basketball, ice hockey, squash, tennis, crew, golf, baseball and lacrosse. Varsity Lacrosse  Since the start of varsity lacrosse interscholastic competition at St. Paul's in 1933, the Crusaders have won 25 titles in the old Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) followed by the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) — more than any other team in the conference. Most recently, St. Paul's defeated longtime rival Boys' Latin School of Maryland by a score of 17-7 in the 2010 MIAA Conference Championship game at Towson University's sports facility Johnny Unitas Stadium. St. Paul's has produced twelve C. Markland Kelly Award winners, which honors the top scholastic player in the state of Maryland each year. St. Paul's has also produced 22 high school All-Americans and 21 graduates in the U.S. Lacrosse Hall of Fame (next to Johns Hopkins University), in addition to producing more college All-Americans than any other program in the country. St. Paul's School athletics field St. Paul's claimed its first lacrosse title in the old Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) public/private schools league in 1940 under Lacrosse Hall of Fame head coach Howdy Myers. St. Paul's would dominate the next two decades in the MSA winning the title 14 times. During this stretch, many college programs would schedule scrimmages against St. Paul's in the early spring. In 1947, St. Paul's beat Princeton University twice, the first coming in a preseason scrimmage in Princeton, New Jersey, and the second a scheduled game at Johns Hopkins University's Homewood Field. During this period, St. Paul's posted five undefeated seasons, four under Howdy Myers and another in 1951 while Jim Adams was the head coach. The 1969 Crusader team, coached by George Mitchell, went undefeated and is considered one of the best. The 1992 St. Paul's team also went undefeated, winning a MSA championship under coach Mitch Whiteley. In 2010, St. Paul's won the conference championship, the 25th in school history, under head coach Rick Brocato.  Varsity Football  Since varsity football began early at St.Paul's in 1936, the Crusaders have won 20 championships. Mitch Tullai former varsity football coach coached at St. Paul's from 1953-1993. Tullai coached for 40 years and won 11 Championships, including 6 MSA C-Conference Championships, and 5 Tri-County Championships.  Varsity Basketball  Inaugural season was 1935 Won a total of 16 championships with 13 total coaches. Won championships in the MSA \\"B\\" Conference, Baltimore Interacademic League Champions, (IAC), MSA “C”, MSA “A” Conference, MIAA B Conference Most recent championship was in 2016-2017. Howdy Myers won the first championship in 1938-39 in the MSA B conference. Varsity Golf The Varsity Golf team at St. Paul's School currently holds 16 MIAA or MSA championship titles, 8 stroke-play championship titles, 8 individual champions, and 11 All Metro Players. The team's home course is the West Course at Baltimore Country Club. The head coach is Eric Nordstrom with the head emeritus being Rick Collins.

The council upholds the school's honor code and the principles of the school motto, Veritas et Virtus, truth and virtue. Each year, the St. Paul's community returns to the site of its founding at Old St. Paul's Parish in downtown Baltimore for the annual Lessons and Carols celebrations, a tradition that originated in the Anglican community. Students from all years participate in the day-long festivities. The first alumni association was founded in 1894. Today, St. Paul's has an active alumni membership of over 2,500. Each year, the alumni association plays host to a number of events that bring alums back to campus, such as the bull roast dinner, which is an annual highpoint.

Formally :Y_t=\\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty b_j \\\\varepsilon_{t-j}+\\\\eta_t, where: :*Y_t is the time series being considered, :*\\\\varepsilon_t is an uncorrelated sequence which is the innovation process to the process Y_t – that is, a white noise process that is input to the linear filter {b_j } . :*b is the possibly infinite vector of moving average weights (coefficients or parameters) :*\\\\eta_t is a deterministic time series, such as one represented by a sine wave. The moving average coefficients have these properties: # Stable, that is square summable \\\\sum_{j=1}^{\\\\infty}b_{j}^2 < \\\\infty # Causal (i.e. there are no terms with j < 0) # Minimum delay # Constant ( b_j independent of t) # It is conventional to define b_0 = 1 This theorem can be considered as an existence theorem: any stationary process has this seemingly special representation. Not only is the existence of such a simple linear and exact representation remarkable, but even more so is the special nature of the moving average model. Imagine creating a process that is a moving average but not satisfying these properties 1–4. For example, the coefficients b_j could define an acausal and model. Nevertheless the theorem assures the existence of a causal that exactly represents this process. How this all works for the case of causality and the minimum delay property is discussed in Scargle (1981), where an extension of the Wold Decomposition is discussed. The usefulness of the Wold Theorem is that it allows the dynamic evolution of a variable Y_{t} to be approximated by a linear model. If the innovations \\\\varepsilon_{t} are independent, then the linear model is the only possible representation relating the observed value of Y_{t} to its past evolution. However, when \\\\varepsilon_{t} is merely an uncorrelated but not independent sequence, then the linear model exists but it is not the only representation of the dynamic dependence of the series. In this latter case, it is possible that the linear model may not be very useful, and there would be a nonlinear model relating the observed value of Y_{t} to its past evolution. However, in practical time series analysis, it is often the case that only linear predictors are considered, partly on the grounds of simplicity, in which case the Wold decomposition is directly relevant. The Wold representation depends on an infinite number of parameters, although in practice they usually decay rapidly. The autoregressive model is an alternative that may have only a few coefficients if the corresponding moving average has many. These two models can be combined into an autoregressive- moving average (ARMA) model, or an autoregressive-integrated-moving average (ARIMA) model if non-stationarity is involved. See and references there; in addition this paper gives an extension of the Wold Theorem that allows more generality for the moving average (not necessarily stable, causal, or minimum delay) accompanied by a sharper characterization of the innovation (identically and independently distributed, not just uncorrelated). This extension allows the possibility of models that are more faithful to physical or astrophysical processes, and in particular can sense ″the arrow of time.″ References  * Wold, H.

It states that every isometry is a direct sum of copies of the unilateral shift and a unitary operator. In time series analysis, the theorem implies that any stationary discrete-time stochastic process can be decomposed into a pair of uncorrelated processes, one deterministic, and the other being a moving average process.  Details  Let H be a Hilbert space, L(H) be the bounded operators on H, and V ∈ L(H) be an isometry. The Wold decomposition states that every isometry V takes the form :V = (\\\\oplus_{\\\\alpha \\\\in A} S) \\\\oplus U for some index set A, where S is the unilateral shift on a Hilbert space Hα, and U is a unitary operator (possible vacuous). The family {Hα} consists of isomorphic Hilbert spaces. A proof can be sketched as follows. Successive applications of V give a descending sequences of copies of H isomorphically embedded in itself: :H = H \\\\supset V(H) \\\\supset V^2 (H) \\\\supset \\\\cdots = H_0 \\\\supset H_1 \\\\supset H_2 \\\\supset \\\\cdots, where V(H) denotes the range of V. The above defined Hi = Vi(H). If one defines :M_i = H_i \\\\ominus H_{i+1} = V^i (H \\\\ominus V(H)) \\\\quad \\\\text{for} \\\\quad i \\\\geq 0 \\\\;, then :H = (\\\\oplus_{i \\\\geq 0} M_i) \\\\oplus (\\\\cap_{i \\\\geq 0} H_i) = K_1 \\\\oplus K_2. It is clear that K1 and K2 are invariant subspaces of V. So V(K2) = K2. In other words, V restricted to K2 is a surjective isometry, i.e., a unitary operator U. Furthermore, each Mi is isomorphic to another, with V being an isomorphism between Mi and Mi+1: V \\"shifts\\" Mi to Mi+1. Suppose the dimension of each Mi is some cardinal number α. We see that K1 can be written as a direct sum Hilbert spaces :K_1 = \\\\oplus H_{\\\\alpha} where each Hα is an invariant subspaces of V and V restricted to each Hα is the unilateral shift S. Therefore :V = V \\\\vert_{K_1} \\\\oplus V\\\\vert_{K_2} = (\\\\oplus_{\\\\alpha \\\\in A} S) \\\\oplus U, which is a Wold decomposition of V.  Remarks  It is immediate from the Wold decomposition that the spectrum of any proper, i.e. non-unitary, isometry is the unit disk in the complex plane. An isometry V is said to be pure if, in the notation of the above proof, ∩i≥0 Hi = {0}. The multiplicity of a pure isometry V is the dimension of the kernel of V*, i.e. the cardinality of the index set A in the Wold decomposition of V. In other words, a pure isometry of multiplicity N takes the form :V = \\\\oplus_{1 \\\\le \\\\alpha \\\\le N} S . In this terminology, the Wold decomposition expresses an isometry as a direct sum of a pure isometry and a unitary operator. A subspace M is called a wandering subspace of V if Vn(M) ⊥ Vm(M) for all n ≠ m. In particular, each Mi defined above is a wandering subspace of V.  A sequence of isometries  The decomposition above can be generalized slightly to a sequence of isometries, indexed by the integers.  The C*-algebra generated by an isometry  Consider an isometry V ∈ L(H). Denote by C*(V) the C*-algebra generated by V, i.e. C*(V) is the norm closure of polynomials in V and V*. The Wold decomposition can be applied to characterize C*(V). Let C(T) be the continuous functions on the unit circle T. We recall that the C*-algebra C*(S) generated by the unilateral shift S takes the following form :C*(S) = {Tf \\\\+ K  Tf is a Toeplitz operator with continuous symbol f ∈ C(T) and K is a compact operator}. In this identification, S = Tz where z is the identity function in C(T). The algebra C*(S) is called the Toeplitz algebra. Theorem (Coburn) C*(V) is isomorphic to the Toeplitz algebra and V is the isomorphic image of Tz. The proof hinges on the connections with C(T), in the description of the Toeplitz algebra and that the spectrum of a unitary operator is contained in the circle T. The following properties of the Toeplitz algebra will be needed: #T_f + T_g = T_{f+g}.\\\\, # T_f ^* = T_ . #The semicommutator T_fT_g - T_{fg} \\\\, is compact. The Wold decomposition says that V is the direct sum of copies of Tz and then some unitary U: :V = (\\\\oplus_{\\\\alpha \\\\in A} T_z) \\\\oplus U. So we invoke the continuous functional calculus f → f(U), and define : \\\\Phi : C^*(S) \\\\rightarrow C^*(V) \\\\quad \\\\text{by} \\\\quad \\\\Phi(T_f + K) = \\\\oplus_{\\\\alpha \\\\in A} (T_f + K) \\\\oplus f(U). One can now verify Φ is an isomorphism that maps the unilateral shift to V: By property 1 above, Φ is linear. The map Φ is injective because Tf is not compact for any non-zero f ∈ C(T) and thus Tf \\\\+ K = 0 implies f = 0. Since the range of Φ is a C*-algebra, Φ is surjective by the minimality of C*(V). Property 2 and the continuous functional calculus ensure that Φ preserves the *-operation. Finally, the semicommutator property shows that Φ is multiplicative. Therefore the theorem holds.

Since the forecast error is derived from the same scale of data, comparisons between the forecast errors of different series can only be made when the series are on the same scale. In simple cases, a forecast is compared with an outcome at a single time-point and a summary of forecast errors is constructed over a collection of such time-points. Here the forecast may be assessed using the difference or using a proportional error. By convention, the error is defined using the value of the outcome minus the value of the forecast. In other cases, a forecast may consist of predicted values over a number of lead-times; in this case an assessment of forecast error may need to consider more general ways of assessing the match between the time-profiles of the forecast and the outcome. If a main application of the forecast is to predict when certain thresholds will be crossed, one possible way of assessing the forecast is to use the timing-error--the difference in time between when the outcome crosses the threshold and when the forecast does so. When there is interest in the maximum value being reached, assessment of forecasts can be done using any of: * the difference of times of the peaks; * the difference in the peak values in the forecast and outcome; * the difference between the peak value of the outcome and the value forecast for that time point. Forecast error can be a calendar forecast error or a cross-sectional forecast error, when we want to summarize the forecast error over a group of units. If we observe the average forecast error for a time-series of forecasts for the same product or phenomenon, then we call this a calendar forecast error or time- series forecast error. If we observe this for multiple products for the same period, then this is a cross-sectional performance error. Reference class forecasting has been developed to reduce forecast error. Combining forecasts has also been shown to reduce forecast error. Calculating forecast error The forecast error is the difference between the observed value and its forecast based on all previous observations. If the error is denoted as e(t) then the forecast error can be written as; e(t)=y(t)-\\\\hat{y}(tt-1) where, y(t) = observation \\\\hat{y}(tt-1) = denote the forecast of y(t) based on all previous observations Forecast errors can be evaluated using a variety of methods namely mean percentage error, root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error. Other methods include tracking signal and forecast bias. For forecast errors on training data y(t) denotes the observation and \\\\hat{y}(tt-1) is the forecast For forecast errors on test data y(t+h) denotes the actual value of the h-step observation and the forecast is denoted as \\\\hat{y}(t+ht)  Examples of forecasting errors  Michael Fish - A few hours before the Great Storm of 1987 broke, on 15 October 1987, he said during a forecast: \\"Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way. Well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't!\\". The storm was the worst to hit South East England for three centuries, causing record damage and killing 19 people. Great Recession - The financial and economic crisis that erupted in 2007—arguably the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s—was not foreseen by most of the forecasters, even if a few lone analysts had been predicting it for some time (for example, Nouriel Roubini and Robert Shiller). The failure to forecast the \\"Great Recession\\" has caused a lot of soul searching in the profession. The UK's Queen Elizabeth herself asked why had nobody noticed that the credit crunch was on its way, and a group of economists—experts from business, the City, its regulators, academia, and government—tried to explain in a letter.British Academy-The Global Financial Crisis Why Didn't Anybody Notice?-Retrieved July 27, 2015 It was not just forecasting the Great Recession, but also its impact where it was clear that economists struggled. For example, in Singapore, Kit Wei Zheng, a government scholar at Citi, argued the country would experience \\"the most severe recession in Singapore’s history\\". It turns out that he couldn't have been more wrong. In the end the economy grew in 2009 by 3.1% and in 2010, the nation saw a 15.2% growth rate.

The reasons which have determined their choice of such a meeting place are no secret; they desire by this outrageous provocation to glut the hatred which they nourish against the Church, and to bring their incendiary torches within reach of the Roman Pontificate by attacking it in its very seat.\\"Paragraph 3, Etsi Nos \\"Etsi Nos\\" was one of Leo's first encyclicals to a specific country's bishops, in this case, Italy, the newly created state which surrounded the Vatican. In \\"Etsi Nos,\\" Leo derided the governments that had taken over the country. After the formation of the Italian State in 1870, a series of Socialist governments governed Italy. In 1876, the election of Agostino Depretis as Prime Minister was the beginning of the long Socialist period. Northern Italy was industrialized and richer than the southern part of Italy which was marked by depravity. Depretis had to resign in 1878 due to scandal in his government. Leo insisted that his clergy rise above the Italy's immorality: \\"...in these days there is great and far extended corruption of morals, there is need in priests of singular excellence of virtue and constancy. They can by no means avoid associating with men; by the very duties of their office, indeed, they are compelled to have intimate relations with the people; and that in the midst of cities where there is hardly any lust that has not permitted and unbridled license. From which it follows that virtue in the clergy ought at this time to be strong enough peacefully to guard itself, and both conquer all the blandishments of desire and securely overcome dangerous examples.\\" Depretis was reelected in 1879 and was therefore as the Prime Minister at the time of the writing of \\"Etsi Nos\\" was the target of Leo's complaints. Depretis tried a method of government called “Transformismo” which ignored party labels, taking ministers from both left and right. When 500 Italian troops were killed by Ethiopians at the Battle of Dogali in January 1887, his government resigned a second time. The fear of authoritarian measures from the Socialist government according to Leo, resulted in “a paucity of clerics has everywhere followed the laws which have been enacted to the injury of the Church, so plainly, that it is necessary for those who by the grace of God are being trained to Holy Orders, to give double attention, and by increased diligence, zeal, and devotion to compensate for the sparse supply.”  See also  * Anti-Masonry * Christianity and Freemasonry * Catholicism and Freemasonry * Clarification concerning status of Catholics becoming Freemasons (1981) * Humanum genus (1884) * List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII * Papal documents relating to Freemasonry References Category:Catholicism and Freemasonry Category:Catholicism- related controversies Category:History of Catholicism in Italy Category:Freemasonry in Italy Category:1882 documents Category:1882 in Christianity Category:Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII ","title":"Etsi Nos"},{"id":"4415181","text":"Union of Retaliation (Polish:Związek Odwetu or Z.O.) was a Polish World War II resistance organization established on 20 April 1940. It was created by General Stefan Rowecki, head of the Armed Resistance, as that organization's branch dedicated to sabotage and covert operations.  Early history  The ZO was formed out of a variety of previously-existent sabotage groups which were then merged into the ZWZ. Initially a part of the ZWZ, all of them were then separated. Thus the risk of eliminating the whole ZWZ by destruction of one of its sabotage cells was eliminated. Initially headed by Maj. Franciszek Niepokólczycki Teodor, the organization was aimed at diminishing the German military and industrial potential by means of active and passive sabotage. It also carried out a number of revenge actions as a reprisal for particularly brutal German mass shootings, łapankas or other actions aimed at Polish civilians. The net of sabotage and intelligence cells organized by the ZO included almost every major German-controlled factory in occupied Poland, as well as a number of special detachments, used by the ZO's headquarters for particularly difficult actions.  Increased resistance measures  German supply train derailed in a Zwiazek Odwetu sabotage operation in occupied Poland, ca. 1942. In February 1942, the commander in chief of the Polish forces and the prime minister of Poland, Gen. Władysław Sikorski, withdrew his order of limiting armed resistance in Poland, the ZO's network started to grow significantly. It also organized a number of spectacular actions against the German war effort. Out of several hundred thousand actions (mainly in Silesia, Lesser Poland, Holy Cross Mountains and Mazovia), perhaps the best known is the Wieniec. During that action, carried out in October 1942, the Polish resistance blew up all railways leading from and to Warsaw, destroyed 4 German supply trains going for the Eastern Front and disrupted the supply transport for several days (with the Warsaw train hub being cut out for roughly 15 hours). In December, the action was continued by the ZO in Eastern Poland, as a reprisal for the German terror in the area around Zamość.  Merger into Armia Krajowa  After the ZWZ was reformed into the Armia Krajowa, the ZO was again incorporated into it, merged with the Wachlarz and OSA units and formed the backbone of the Kedyw organization. During the later stages of its existence, the ZO was headed by Maj. Jan Wojciech Kiwerski.

After leaving the National League, Hogan moved on to the minor league Indianapolis Hoosiers. Some sources suggest he set a national baserunning record in the 1890s.The Baltimore Sun Almanac for 1909 (Baltimore, Maryland: A. S. Abell Co., 1909), p. 200.The World Almanac and Encyclopedia 1906 (New York: Press Publishing Co., 1905), p. 277. When his playing career ended, he worked as a minor league baseball manager in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. As a manager, Hogan groomed several pitchers who excelled in the major leagues. He signed future stars Stan Coveleski and Sam Jones to their first professional contracts and helped launch the career of Roy Castleton, the first native of Utah to play in the major leagues. In 1912, Hogan was among a select group of veteran managers invited to participate in the United States Baseball League, which was treated by the baseball establishment as an \\"outlaw league\\". For reasons that are unclear, he did not actually manage a franchise in the short-lived alternative league and resumed his career as a minor league manager. Hogan eventually settled in his adopted hometown of Youngstown, Ohio, where he died in 1923.  Early years  Hogan was born to Patrick J. Hogan, Sr., and his wife, the former Margaret Gillen, in the West Midlands industrial town of Wednesbury, Staffordshire, England. When he was still a child, his parents, both natives of Ireland, relocated the family from England to Youngstown, Ohio, a steel-production center near the Pennsylvania border. Although Hogan is routinely identified as Anglo-American (given his English birth), baseball historians Joel Zoss and John Bowman wrote that he probably regarded himself as an Irish American.Zoss and Bowman (2004), p. 120. The Hogan family settled on Youngstown's near west side, in a working-class district known as Westlake's Crossing. In Youngstown, Hogan's father, Patrick J. Hogan, Sr., secured employment as a steelworker, while his older brother, Patrick J. Hogan, Jr., worked his way up to the position of \\"roller\\" at the Union Steel Company (later consolidated with U.S. Steel). Martin Hogan moved in the direction of an athletic career, gaining early recognition as a \\"foot racer\\". His interest in sports was evidently encouraged by his father, who closely followed his son's baseball career even in later life. Patrick J. Hogan, Sr.'s obituary described him as \\"a great baseball fan\\", who \\"was as quick to appreciate a clever 'steal' or a 'heady' play as any one of the younger generation\\". While little is known about Martin Hogan's early years in Youngstown, there is evidence he was popular among local residents. His obituary referred to him as an individual \\"of pleasing personality\\" who \\"made many friends during his long residence in Youngstown\\". Another newspaper article described him as \\"a good fellow\\", and a third indicated he was well liked among players with whom he worked. At the same time, Hogan was reportedly quick to comment when he felt he was treated unfairly.  Playing career  alt=Poster depicting portraits of several men, most of whom have their heads tilted slightly. Before joining the major leagues, Hogan played for minor league baseball teams in the northeastern United States, including the Akron (Ohio) Summits and Scranton (Pennsylvania) Miners. He began his career as a major league player with the Cincinnati Reds, on August 4, 1894, but played only six games before switching to the St. Louis Browns (later known as the Cardinals). By this time, St. Louis had been eliminated from league championship contention, after being tied with Cleveland and Boston for first place in April.Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1895), p. 114. Hogan participated in 29 games with St. Louis in the 1894 season. According to the 1895 edition of Spalding's Official Baseball Guide, he ranked tenth among league outfielders with a percentage of .941 for put-outs, assists, and errors.Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1895), p. 99. Among his teammates, Hogan held the second highest percentage of stolen bases for games played. In March 1895, a reporter for Sporting Life praised the Browns' decision to retain Hogan in center field and emphasized the young outfielder's potential. \\"On the bases and in the field the lad is a wonder\\", the paper stated. \\"His only fault is weakness at the bat, but increasing confidence and familiarity with [National] League players will undoubtedly improve him in this respect\\". Despite Hogan's physical speed, however, his overall performance with the Browns proved uneven, and his two- season batting average was just .241. On May 17, 1895, the Youngstown Daily Vindicator reported that Hogan had been \\"farmed out\\" as a center fielder to the Indianapolis Hoosiers, a club connected to the well-organized Western League, the predecessor of the American League. The Vindicator added, \\"At any time by giving a proper notification the St. Louis team, of which club Hogan is a member, can again secure his services\\". Yet, for reasons that are unclear, Hogan never returned to the St. Louis Browns. He played his last game with the team on April 24, 1895, concluding a major-league career that comprised 40 games over two seasons.Thorn, Palmer, and Reuther (1989), p. 1187. At Indianapolis, Hogan led at the bat, and contemporary sources indicate his performance improved. \\"Marty Hogan, who is playing temporarily in middle field for the Indianapolis team of the western league...is covering himself in glory with his superb playing\\", the Vindicator reported on June 4, 1895. \\"The Indianapolis Sentinel of May 31st says: Hogan made a great record at the bat yesterday morning\\", the newspaper added. \\"One of the drives was for a home run and three of the hits were bunts\\". In addition, the article credited Hogan with four runs, five base hits, and two put outs in a late morning game against a rival team from St. Paul, Minnesota. The Vindicator went on to quote the Indianapolis Journal as follows: \\"Among the features of the forenoon game was Hogan's batting. He got five hits, one a home run, and his bunting was even cleverer than usual, and that is saying a great deal\\". The article concluded, \\"If he keeps up this gait, it will not be long before [St. Louis Browns owner Chris] Von der Ahe reclaims his pet\\". Hogan's obituary stated that, at some point in his playing career, he set a record for baserunning. Several sources trace this record to a field day event held in Indianapolis in 1895, when he reportedly rounded the bases in 13.2 seconds. The World Almanac and Encyclopedia 1906, for instance, reported that Hogan \\"lowered the base- running record\\" in 1895, noting that \\"[t]he distance around the bases is 120 yards\\". In January 1906, Sporting Life reported that Hogan had \\"taken steps to have the base running record awarded to him\\". The report added, \\"Under proper conditions [Hogan] turned the route in 13 1-5 seconds at Indianapolis in 1895\\". Some observers questioned the veracity of the record, however. In 1907, for instance, Washington Post sports columnist J. Ed Grillo conceded that \\"Hogan was a great sprinter\\" but described his unofficial record as \\"out of reason\\". Grillo, who argued that \\"the fastest runners in baseball failed to come anywhere near the mark\\", lent his support to an official record of 14.1 that had been set more recently by Eastern League player Wally Clement. An article published in the Washington Herald days earlier also raised questions about Hogan's baserunning record. In this case, however, the writer claimed that the most \\"authentic\\" record had been set by Harry Berthrong in the 1860s. The article stated that, while Hogan was \\"said to have beaten Berthrong's base-circling record of 13 2-5 seconds by a fifth of a second\\", this alleged feat was not \\"performed under official sanction\\". One year earlier, in 1906, Berthrong, himself, weighed in on the debate. According to an article that appeared in Sporting Life in March of that year, Berthrong disputed Hogan's claim. \\"My time...around the bases was made in Washington, D.C., in July 1868, after the old Nationals of Washington, D.C., had played a game with the Pastimes of Baltimore, Md.\\", Berthrong was quoted as saying in an interview. \\"Three stop watches were held over me, the slowest giving me 14 1/4\\". The retired player added: \\"I am skeptical about this man Hogan doing the bases in 13 1-5: nobody but an Arthur Duffey could possibly do it, and I doubt if he could\\". For reasons that are unclear, the article indicated that Hogan claimed to round the bases in 1889, six earlier than other reports. (A similar description of Hogan's claim appeared elsewhere in the same edition of Sporting Life; a brief news item suggested he claimed to set the record \\"in Indianapolis in the 80's\\". ) Baseball historian Jon Daly traced Hogan's contested record to 1898; he speculated that Ben Morgan, an official of the National Association, \\"disputed that claim when doing a study of field day records\\". The most widely accepted national baserunning record was set by Evar Swanson, who rounded the bases in 13.4 seconds in 1929. Despite questions surrounding Hogan's baserunning record, he became popularly known as the \\"Indianapolis Ringer\\". Newspaper reports suggest he defended his position as baserunning champion of the Western League in various pre-game competitions. On August 2, 1895, the Vindicator noted that the outfielder had \\"a rival for the base running honors in the western league in George Nichol of the Milwaukees who, it is claimed, can get down to first quicker than Hogan\\". The article added, \\"A race between the two is talked of\\". Then, on August 17, 1895, the Vindicator reported that Hogan had defeated Detroit outfielder Frank Tower in a baserunning contest. \\"The Hoosiers have in Mart Hogan a pretty good extra card\\", the article added. \\"Indianapolis goes around the land, and their sprinting outfielder meets all comers in foot races before the game. He has not yet been defeated\\". Several days earlier, the same newspaper quoted a journalist from Sporting Life, who reportedly commented: \\"Mart Hogan, the Indianapolis outfielder, is showing such astonishing speed that he will probably be taken to England next year for the Sheffield Handicap\\". In February 1896, Hogan received an offer to manage the Youngstown (Ohio) Puddlers, a minor league team associated with the Interstate League. The Vindicator reported that the outfielder refused the offer. \\"Hogan expects to play again with the St. Louis team in the National League\\", the Vindicator stated. The paper went on to quote an article that supposedly appeared in the Cincinnati-based Commercial Gazette: \\"St. Louis fans are opposed to the idea of selling Marty Hogan, the fast out-fielder, who played with the Indianapolis team last season, having been loaned by the Browns\\". In the spring of 1896, however, Hogan attempted to extricate himself from remaining contractual obligations to the St. Louis Browns. Sporting Life reported, in May 1896, that Hogan was unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain a final release from the Browns, who retained him as an \\"extra\\" right fielder. \\"Marty has not been given any kind of trial by the manager of the Browns, although he stood high in batting and base running in the Western League last year\\", the article stated. \\"He is in fine condition, and is anxious to play, but does not prepare to be shifted about at the will of alleged managers\\". The paper added that Hogan had returned to St. Louis in March 1896, prepared to \\"purchase\\" his release, \\"but he has been held onto until now, when he could have secured $1550 for his services in the Western League\\". Hogan appeared especially confident of his baserunning abilities. The article noted that the outfielder had \\"offered to match himself to run 100 yards for $500 a side against any player in the National League\\". Meanwhile, his batting evidently continued to improve. On May 24, 1896, an article in the St. Paul (Minnesota) Globe indicated Hogan performed exceptionally well at the bat during a contest between the Hoosiers and the St. Paul Saints. \\"Marty Hogan...through an inadvertent mix-up of pugilism and baseball...tried to hammer the face off the ball, which had tantalized the other Hoosiers\\", the article stated, \\"and when Marty's work was done, the ball was out of the lot and he was on second base\\". At some point in the 1896 season, Hogan apparently secured his release from the Browns. Once again, however, his physical speed offered no guarantee of consistency on the playing field. On July 21, 1896, the St. Paul (Minneapolis) Globe reported that Hogan had performed poorly in a contest between the Hoosiers and the local ball club. \\"Marty Hogan...made a bad fumble, and then looked up at the sky to see if it had moved while he was locating the ball\\", the paper reported. \\"It was a good bluff, but the crowd discovered Marty's weakness before the end of the game\\". In January 1897, the Vindicator reported that the Hoosiers had sold Hogan to a club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The article called Hogan \\"one of the fastest outfielders and baserunners in the Western League\\" and predicted he would \\"greatly strengthen the Grand Rapids outfield\\". The following month, however, the paper described the previous report as a \\"mistake\\", indicating instead that Hogan had signed a contract with baseball executive John T. Brush to play with the Hoosiers for another year. The paper also reported that the contract granted Hogan \\"the largest salary he has ever drawn\\". Despite this lucrative contract, Hogan established and maintained his own advertising distribution agency in Indianapolis. \\"He goes about the streets dressed much like an English costermonger\\", Sporting Life reported in January 1897. \\"Marty can be seen with a little red wagon full of signs and advertising matter chasing up and down streets nailing the signs to buildings and convenient places and distributing advertising literature in the reel-dance portion of Indianapolis\\". Less than four months later, in May 1897, he was released by the Indianapolis ball club. In June 1897, the Kansas City Journal indicated Hogan had moved on to the Dayton (Ohio) Old Soldiers, a team affiliated with the Class B Interstate League, where he was \\"playing a sensational center field\\". In October of the same year, Sporting Life speculated Hogan would remain with Dayton during the upcoming 1898 season. \\"Marty Hogan's contract with Dayton is such that he cannot be reserved, as are the rest of the players\\", the article stated. \\"Unless Marty has a better offer to play with some other team it is safe to say that he will be with Dayton next year\\". Further research is required to determine how long Hogan continued to play as an outfielder in the minor leagues. (His obituary indicated that he also worked as a major league trainer.) During his playing career, he apparently received at least one serious injury. In February 1903, Sporting Life reported that the former baseball player's friends were \\"anxious to get him appointed on the staff of American League umpires\\". The article added, \\"Hogan has suffered from operations to remove portions of his breast bone, which was injured in a collision during a baseball game\\".  Managing career =Youngstown Ohio Works After retiring as a baseball player, Hogan settled in Youngstown and went into business. At some point, Sam Wright, then sports editor of The Youngstown Daily Vindicator, encouraged him to manage the city's baseball team. In 1902, Hogan was hired as manager of the Youngstown Ohio Works, an independent ball club sponsored by Joseph A. McDonald, superintendent of the Ohio Works of the Carnegie Steel Company. The club did not immediately become associated with an independent league, however. On April 5, 1902, Sporting Life noted that Hogan represented the Youngstown club at a poorly attended meeting of the Western Association, a short-lived independent league based in Cleveland. \\"Marty Hogan arrived at noon and wanted a franchise for Youngstown\\", the paper reported, \\"but Zanesville, Springfield and South Bend, who had asked to be admitted to membership, had no representatives present\\". Then, in January 1904, Sporting Life reported that Hogan had \\"declined the proposition to put a Central League into Youngstown\\". In May 1905, however, the Youngstown club was one of eleven teams to join the Protective Association of Independent Clubs, which formed the basis of the Class C Division Ohio–Pennsylvania League. Ultimately, the league trimmed down to eight teams from the following cities: Akron, Ohio; Homestead, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Newark, Ohio; Niles, Ohio; Sharon, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, and Zanesville, Ohio.Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1906), p. 289. That September, the Youngstown Ohio Works won the league championship, although sources disagree on the team's final record. As baseball researcher John Zajc writes: \\"The Reach Guide (1906) credits Youngstown with an 84-32 won-lost record where the Spalding Guide of the same year lists a 90-35 record. The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball (1993) tells a third story, giving Youngstown an 88-35 mark\\". alt=Group of 15 men standing in three rows. On the heels of this achievement, Hogan reportedly \\"lost his entire infield\\", when several players moved on to more established minor league and major league teams. \\"[Billy] Phyle will go to the [outlaw leagues], Starr will be traded by [American League manager James] McAleer, Whitney goes to Buffalo and Burton will likely return to Central League ball\\", Sporting Life reported. The manager had no difficulty compensating for these losses, however. The sports paper reported, in October 1905, that future major-leaguer Louis \\"Lew\\" Schettler, \\"the star twirler of the Sharon team\\", was anxious to join the Ohio Works team. The paper added that Schettler \\"would like a year under Marty Hogan\\". In December 1905, the paper confirmed that Hogan had secured catcher Lee Fohl and pitcher Schettler, \\"the star battery of this league for last season\\". The paper added that the manager had \\"signed two young Cleveland players in outfielder Hugh Donovan and first baseman Harry [Schwartz]\\". In addition, Hogan attempted to sign on as pitcher Walter Purdue, \\"second rush of the Youngstown polo team\\". Meanwhile, Hogan reportedly \\"sold out his cafe at Youngstown\\" in order to \\"devote his entire time to base ball\\". According to Sporting Life, the manager even planned to challenge former major-leaguer Charlie Morton for the presidency of the Ohio-Pennsylvanie League, a bid that evidently proved unsuccessful. In January 1906, Morton, as league president, called a meeting of the Ohio–Pennsylvania League. According to Sporting Life, representatives of the clubs were scheduled to meet at Zanesville's Hotel Rogge on January 16. \\"Assurances have been received that representatives from Akron, Youngstown, Zanesville, Newark, Lancaster, Mansfield, New Castle, East Liverpool, Steubenville and Erie, Pa., will be present\\", the paper reported, \\"and from there an eight or ten club circuit will probably be formed, with McKeesport, Butler and Ashtabula as applicants also\\". (The league eventually formed an eight-team circuit that included teams from Akron, Lancaster, Mansfield, Newark, New Castle, Sharon, Youngstown and Zanesville.) The paper also noted that William J. Maloney, the center fielder for the Ohio Works club during the previous season, would sign a contract and serve as team captain. Among others, Hogan announced the \\"engagement\\" of Utah-born pitcher Roy Castleton. The Ohio Works team opened the 1906 season with 16 players, three of whom had been part of the club during the 1905 season. According to Sporting Life, Hogan predicted the club would win the pennant at the close of the upcoming season. He expressed confidence in a lineup that included Maloney of Bradford, Kentucky; Will M. Thomas of Morristown, Pennsylvania; Tommy Thomas of Piqua, Ohio; Fohl of Allegheny, Pennsylvania; Schettler of Pittsburgh; \\"Dotty\\" Freck of Columbus, Ohio; A. C. McClintock of Columbus; Castleton of Salt Lake City; Lewis Groh of Rochester, New York; John Kennedy of Youngstown, Charles Crouse of Detroit; Roy Chase of Andover, Ohio; Forrester J. Dressner of Garrettsville, Pennsylvania; Schwartz of Cleveland; and Roy Gould of Middlesex, Pennsylvania. Indeed, in 1906, the Ohio Works team took the league championship once again,Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1910), p. 219. with an 84-53 record, while new player Roy Castleton gained national recognition by pitching a perfect game against a rival club in Akron. On October 1, 1906, Hogan and members of the Ohio Works team were honored at a banquet held at the Elks' Club in downtown Youngstown. Sporting Life reported that the keynote address was delivered by Father M. T. Kinkead, \\"who declared himself a fan of Sunday baseball playing\\". The article added that Hogan \\"was presented with a ring and each player was given a pair of gold cuff link inscribed 'O. & P. Champs 1906'\\". On October 6, 1906, Sporting Life summarized the league's most recent season, reporting that the Ohio Works team had \\"held the lead continually after the first months of the season and at one time threatened a walkover\\". The following month, in November 1906, Hogan responded to rumors that Walter East, manager of the Akron Rubbernecks, had agreed to \\"lay down\\" to the Youngstown club, enabling them to win the pennant. \\"Instead of laying down to us, Akron loaded up with catcher [Red] Munson and pitcher Bob Spade\\", Hogan said in an interview with the Pittsburgh Press. \\"They worked their heads off to down us, but could not do so\\". Hogan went on to assert that the Akron club, and its manager, received generous incentives to defeat Youngstown. \\"The Akron owner offered the players a bonus of $500 if they would beat us out in addition to a $300 wad for East\\", Hogan said. Then, he accused East himself of attempting to \\"fix\\" a game during the 1906 season, claiming that the Akron manager had \\"tried to get another club to take things easy against Akron so that Akron could beat us for the pennant\\". In the wake of the Ohio Works' second league championship, steps were taken to incorporate the club. In December 1906, Sporting Life reported that the team's backers, Joseph and Thomas McDonald, who served as superintendent and assistant superintendent, respectively, of the Ohio Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, were compelled to invite additional investors because of planned (and costly) improvements at the steel plant. \\"The incorporators of the club will be Thomas McDonald, Joseph McDonald, Thomas Carr, Thomas Carter and Marty Hogan\\", the paper stated. \\"Manager Hogan will be given even more control of the team next season than he has had. Heretofore he has had the entire control of the team and transacted most of the business\\". Sporting Life predicted that, in the wake of the team's incorporation, \\"everything will fall absolutely on [Hogan's] shoulders\\". The paper added that the Ohio Works team intended to build a new ballpark on the south side of Youngstown, near the corner of Glenwood and Parkview avenues. \\"One of the largest grand stands in the minor leagues will be put up and the grounds will be in every way modern\\", the article stated. Differences between Hogan and the McDonald brothers, however, had already surfaced in the autumn of 1906. Although a sports writer for The Youngstown Daily Vindicator predicted in October 1906 that the \\"popular\\" Hogan would serve a fourth season as manager of the club, the Ohio Works manager appeared unwilling to negotiate the terms of a new contract without leverage. According to the Vindicator, Hogan publicly mulled an offer presented by a team in Nashville, whose representatives followed him to the train station. The same newspaper article indicated that Hogan later reached a verbal agreement with Ohio Works co-owners Joseph and Thomas McDonald, announcing soon afterwards that he would remain with the local ball club. Yet, by January 1907, the Newark Advocate reported that Hogan wanted to sell the Youngstown franchise.The Newark Advocate, January 5, 1907. The paper observed that \\"a move in offering the Youngstown franchise for sale had created a furor in the league\\". On January 8, 1907, Hogan and Joseph McDonald attended the annual meeting of the National Association of Professional Baseball Clubs in New York City, while the fate of the club remained uncertain. Then, on January 13, The New York Times reported that the Youngstown team would participate in an eight-team \\"outlaw league\\" comprising clubs from Elmira, New York; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Reading, Pennsylvania; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; and Williamsport, Ohio. The Times described the envisioned league as \\"the most powerful 'outlaw' league the National Association of Professional Baseball Clubs was ever called upon to oppose\\", and stated that Hogan would \\"be at the head of\\" the Youngstown team. These rather confusing reports were followed by the abrupt sale and relocation of the Ohio Works team in February 1907.  Zanesville  On February 18, 1907, the Zanesville Signal reported that Hogan had received permission from the McDonald brothers to negotiate a $3,000 deal for the sale of the Youngstown club, including its players, to a group of investors in Zanesville, Ohio. In an interview with the Signal, the manager expressed frustration with the team's former backers, when he said, \\"Youngstown couldn't or didn't raise enough money to cover a sparrow's blanket\\". The Zanesville investors reportedly raised an additional $15,000 to enter the team into the Ohio–Pennsylvania League, although they were forced to settle for the less prestigious Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League. The eight-team P-O-M league included clubs from Braddock, Pennsylvania; Charleroi, Pennsylvania; East Liverpool, Ohio; McKeesport, Pennsylvania; Steubenville, Ohio; Uniontown, Pennsylvania; and Washington, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Hogan reportedly had some difficulty securing new players for the team. In June 1907, the Marion Daily Mirror described Zanesville's efforts to sign Bill Dithridge, a player in the Baltimore Eastern League, as \\"merely another of the pipe dreams of one Marty Hogan\\". The article added, \\"Dithridge is not to be sold to Zanesville, and he has informed Hogan that he will play with his team under no conditions whatever\\". The paper did observe, however, that Hogan had signed a Cleveland player named Tate and planned to secure another outfielder, \\"when three members of the present team will be canned\\". After settling in Zanesville, Hogan apparently received offers from other teams. Sporting Life reported in June 1907 that Hogan was invited to manage a team in Rochester, New York, but had turned down the offer. Then, in October, Hogan was offered management of yet another league franchise in South Bend, Indiana, but, once again, he declined. He managed the Zanesville ball club for two seasons. During its first season, the team placed first in the eight-team P-O-M League, with a record of 15 wins and seven losses. In 1908, his final season, the team was christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. According to Sporting Life, the \\"schedule meeting\\" for the Central League that year was to be held in Zanesville on March 17 (St. Patrick's Day). \\"According to the plans of the magnates the season this year will consist of 140 games, not any of the club owners being willing to return to the 154-game schedule\\", the paper reported. The paper added that Hogan was \\"making light of his task\\" of signing up players for his team. \\"His acquaintance with players, especially in the independent ranks, gives him an advantage which few managers have\\". Sporting Life also reported that by March, Hogan had \\"signed his outfield, the players accepting terms being [Curt] Elson, Blount, and Miller\\". Further research is needed to determine the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at the close of the 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up. More information is available on Hogan's dissatisfaction with his situation in Zanesville, which evidently stemmed from increasing limits on his control over the club. An article that appeared in The (Pittsburgh) Gazette Times in December 1908 described Hogan's reasons for leaving the organization. \\"There were too many directors connected with the Zanesville club to suit Hogan, as each one had his own idea of how a club should be run\\", the paper reported. \\"As Hogan has his own, which did not exactly coincide with the numerous directors, he resigned\\". The Gazette Times praised Hogan's performance in Zanesville, stating that his club \\"was a pennant contender at all stages of the championship race\\". The paper added: \\"He did not have a very good team, but kept the men playing the game at all times and was really the wonder of the [P.O.M.] league\\".  Lancaster Red Roses  The following year, in 1909, Hogan relocated to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he replaced local ball club manager Clarence \\"Pop\\" Foster, who had managed the Red Roses since 1907. Once Hogan signed a contract, Foster moved on to lead another club in Trenton, New Jersey. The Lancaster team's momentum escalated during the 1909 season, and in July of that year, Sporting Life reported that the Red Roses club was drawing positive attention. \\"The fast pace at which the Lancaster bunch has been going lately has been the talk of the league\\", the paper stated. \\"Marty Hogan was not given much consideration as a pennant aspirant when the season opened, but the plucky Red Roses manager has been 'sawing wood' and not talking\\". Indeed, by the close of the 1909 season, the Lancaster Red Roses had worked up a 75-39 record, seizing the championship of the Tri-State League.Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1910), p. 181. As Spalding's Baseball Guide (1910) reported: \\"Lancaster, under manager Marty Hogan, won its first pennant in the league, and the top rung of the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting\\". Sporting Life indicated that Hogan was confident of the outcome early in the season. \\"After his return from the first trip around the circuit\\", wrote reporter G. H. Hartley, \\"Marty said to your correspondent that he saw nothing in the league that was better than his team\\". Hartley noted that, on the closing day of the season, Hogan accepted the Farnsworth Cup, \\"the Tri-State trophy\\", on behalf of his team. \\"Between the first and second innings the [Lancaster] players presented Manager Marty Hogan with a beautiful silver set and a silver loving cup\\", he added. The inscribed silver cup reportedly left Hogan \\"so surprised that he was unable to respond\\". On September 7, 1909, one day after the contest, the Reading Eagle stated, \\"A great crowd witnessed the final game, in which Hogan's gallant band trimmed the Trenton wanderers\\". The newspaper added, \\"The real enthusiasm was awakened, however, by the floating of the championship pennant, awarded by a Phila. [sic] paper\\". A key participant in the team's successful performance was a young pitcher named Stan Coveleski, who went on to post a record of 53 wins and 38 losses during his three seasons with Lancaster.Kashatus (2002), p. 44. He made his professional debut with the Philadelphia Athletics three seasons later.Wilbert (2003), p. 169. Indeed, the Ogden Standard had praised Hogan as a \\"live wire\\" back in February 1909, when he \\"grabbed up the three brothers of Harry Coveleski of the Phillies, and had them all sign contracts\\". Highlights of the season may have included an exhibition game with the Philadelphia Phillies, which was scheduled to be held in Lancaster on April 2, 1909. alt=Group of 14 men. The majority are standing, while some in the front are sitting. The following year, however, the Red Roses' performance fell short of the previous season when it placed second, with 63 wins and 47 losses.Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1911), p. 214. According to Spalding's Baseball Guide (1911), the Lancaster organization was one of several teams in the league caught off guard by a surprisingly strong new club from Altoona, Pennsylvania, which was \\"sent along at a clip that practically clinched the season\\".Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1911), p. 218. While the Red Roses pulled out of a mid-season slump, the \\"Altoonas\\" prevailed with a 72-38 record. In an article regarding this outcome, Sporting Life stated that \\"nothing can be found to cast discredit upon the Lancaster team or its popular manager, Marty Hogan\\". The paper added, \\"With a team that never stood high in club hitting or fielding, Marty pulled them through and anchored them in second place, which position they attained more by dint of their cleverness in inside work than with their prowess with the stick or in the field\\". In December 1910, a little more than two months after the article appeared, Hogan reportedly set down roots in Lancaster, opening a cigar shop and billiard hall in the city. His relationship with the Red Roses would not last more than another season, however. In 1911, Hogan's final year as manager of the Lancaster team, the club placed fourth in the eight-team league,Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1912), p. 185. with 54 wins and losses, respectively. Sporting Life reported that Hogan began the 1911 season with relatively modest expectations. The paper stated, \\"Hogan is not promising a pennant-winning team...but he does promise a good team and means to fight hard for the pennant again\\". The team's challenges included salary limits that sharply limited its capacity to attract more experienced players. Earlier that year, the Tri-State League's imposition of $1,900 limits for individual salaries had created a stir throughout Lancaster, where fans resented the fact that outgoing clubs had been permitted to vote on an issue that would not affect them. Club president John H. Myers' efforts to persuade the league to \\"advance the individual salary limit\\" proved unsuccessful, and Hogan \\"was directed to secure the best team that can be secured\\" under the circumstances. In January 1911, Hogan had announced he would \\"cut out exhibition games and devote the entire preparatory season to hard practice\\". Hogan added that \\"the exhibitions do not pay the club, and do harm to the unseasoned players\\". Ultimately, the 1911 league championship went to a franchise from Reading, Pennsylvania, which \\"took the lead at the beginning of the season and never was headed until the finish\\", closing with a record of 74-35.Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1912), pp. 184-185.  United States Baseball League  In March 1912, organizers of a proposed United States Baseball League-described by members of the sports establishment as an \\"outlaw league\\"-met in New York City's Hotel Imperial. The league is widely viewed as \\"a major precursor to the Federal League of 1914-1915\\". Hogan, who attended the New York meeting, was named as manager of a Cincinnati-based franchise scheduled to compete in the league. (The U.S. Baseball League also established teams in Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York City, Reading, Pennsylvania; Richmond, Virginia; and Washington, D.C.) The following month, however, Hogan was evidently replaced by Hugh McKinnon, who was described in an April New York Times article as manager of the league's Cincinnati franchise. An article that appeared in The New York Times several weeks earlier suggested that McKinnon was originally tapped as manager of the league's Washington franchise. The same article also pointed out that ex-major leaguer George Browne \\"had been approached by the Washington Club\\". In the end, Browne was named as head of the Washington team when McKinnon was appointed manager of the Cincinnati club. While these developments shed some light on the outcome, the reasons for Hogan's replacement as manager of the Cincinnati franchise remain uncertain. In any event, the league did not survive for long. Sports historian Rudolf K. Haerle observed that the U.S. Baseball League \\"stressed the inherent 'good' of baseball for all individuals and communities, and indicated that it wished to conduct its business in the accepted capitalist style-free competition in the marketplace\\". The new league, however, quickly incurred the scorn and hostility of the baseball establishment. Burdened with weak leadership, limited financing, poor attendance, and a lack of skillful players, the U.S. Baseball League \\"folded after about one month of action\\". In June 1912, when the league ceased operation, the Cincinnati team that Hogan was supposed to manage ranked fourth in the eight-team roster, earning 12 wins and 10 losses. The following year, former players of the Cincinnati club successfully sued the team's owner, John J. Ryan, for unpaid wages. Sporting Life reported that the club's members \\"received their money in Cincinnati on February 12\\".  Zanesville Flood Sufferers  In November 1912, The Youngstown Daily Vindicator reported that Hogan would once again manage a local minor league ball club. The paper added, however, that the former Ohio Works manager was also considering an offer in Zanesville. Hogan evidently led the Zanesville team the previous season. In November 1912, Sporting Life reported that the manager was still mulling his next move when he attended the annual meeting of the National Association in New York. \\"Marty Hogan, the veteran minor league manager, who is known from end to end of the land as a developer of minor league talent and winner of pennants, could not bear to miss meeting his old friends\\", the paper stated. \\"Marty wound up the season with Zanesville and has not definitely decided upon his plans for the coming season\\". Ultimately, Hogan went to Zanesville, where he managed the Zanesville Flood Sufferers in 1913. The team's nickname was evidently inspired by a massive flood that had devastated cities and towns throughout central and southern Ohio-including Zanesville-in the spring of 1913. In April 1913, Sporting Life noted that the Zanesville club would \\"stick to the circuit\\", despite the fact that the city was \\"hit hard by the recent floods\\". According to the paper, Zanesville's ballpark was \\"completely destroyed, but the games will be played at the Fair Grounds\\". Earlier, in January 1913, the Flood Sufferers pulled out from the 12-team Central League and joined the newly formed Interstate League, which included eight clubs. According to Sporting Life, the new league was expected to include teams from Akron, Youngstown, Canton, Steubenville, Wheeling, and either Johnstown or McKeesport. In February, the paper confirmed that the Interstate League (which included Johnstown, not McKeesport) had achieved Class B status on the basis of the eight cities' combined populations. Sporting Life, which estimated the total population of the league's participating cities at 412,415, noted that Youngstown (with a population of 79,066) was the largest city in the Interstate League. Later that month, the paper reported that the new league's \\"salary limit of $2000 makes it imperative for each club to hold down expenses in every way; consequently Marty Hogan, of the Zanesville Club, will be the only bench manager in the league, and he knows how to save his salary in various ways\\". During Hogan's tenure as manager of the Zanesville Flood Sufferers, the club took advantage of at least one opportunity to test their skills against a major league club. Sports writer Walter LeConte observed that, on June 15, 1913, the Zanesville team participated in an in-season exhibition game with the New York Giants. When the umpire declared the game forfeited after a disagreement with Giants player Fred Merkle, Hogan \\"ordered the game continued so the fans could see a 9-inning baseball game\\". LeConte added that \\"Hogan even assumed umpiring duties and the game was then concluded\\". The Giants won the game, with a score of 5-4. Reliable information on the Zanesville club's overall performance is currently unavailable, but an Associated Press report indicated the team had disbanded by late July 1913. At Zanesville, Hogan signed future Cleveland Indians pitcher Samuel Pond (\\"Sad Sam\\") Jones to his first professional contract. Baseball historian Alexander Edelman noted that Jones gained valuable experience as a member of the Zanesville club (including a chance to play against the Giants in an exhibition game), but he added that the player \\"was only 20 years old and very homesick\\". When Jones was faced with the prospect of a pay cut, he approached Hogan on the street and demanded that he be released from his contract immediately. Edelman wrote: \\"In what Sam's son, Paul, would later call 'probably the craziest release in baseball history,' Hogan obliged, writing Jones' release in pencil on the inside of a chewing tobacco packet\\".  Fond du Lac Molls  On July 20, 1913, The New York Times reported that Hogan left Zanesville to manage a Fond du Lac franchise in the Illinois-Wisconsin League. According to the article, he planned to bring with him five players from the defunct Zanesville club. Reliable information on the Fond du Lac Molls' overall performance is currently unavailable. In February 1914, Sporting Life reported that Hogan was considering a return to the Tri-State League. \\"In a letter to a friend in Lancaster [Pennsylvania] the former Lancaster manager stated that the Trenton [New Jersey] Club was after him and that there was [sic] good prospects of both sides coming to terms\\", the paper stated. \\"Marty is anxious to get back in the Tri-State, where he won fame as a manager\\". The paper added that Hogan, at that point, was working as a \\"successful businessman\\" in Youngstown, Ohio. The same edition of Sporting Life, however, carried a wire report noting that the Trenton club's new owner, W. J. Morris, had signed Zeke Wrigley as team manager. The report observed, \\"Manager Wrigley was strongly recommended to the club by Connie Mack\\". (Wrigley, a former major league infielder, had earlier pursued a position on the Tri-State League's umpire staff, and he was not initially in the running for the position of Trenton club manager.) Further research will be required to determine whether Hogan's career as a minor league manager continued after this point.  Personal life  alt=Three men standing beside each other. Hogan was married to the former Agnes Daugherty on October 28, 1896, in St. Columba Church, in Youngstown, Ohio. After a wedding trip, the couple initially settled in Indianapolis. Although Hogan's obituary makes no reference to children, he and his wife evidently raised an adopted child, Amy M. Hogan (born Amy Deagon), who died at the age of 16 in a 1921 automobile accident. A front-page article in the Vindicator reported that Amy Hogan was one of three passengers in an automobile whose driver had failed to slow down at a curve in the road and skidded into a telephone pole near Hubbard, Ohio. The article noted that Amy Hogan had recently graduated from Ursuline Academy and described her as \\"a girl of exceptional talents, being especially prominent in local amateur theatricals and entertainments\\". Records at Youngstown's Calvary Cemetery show that Amy Hogan was buried in the same plot as her adoptive parents.Joseph and Joseph (2003), p. 162. Published cemetery records also suggest that Martin Hogan's wife, Agnes Hogan, gave birth to an unnamed infant, who died on September 6, 1898.Joseph and Joseph (2003), p. 171. The infant was buried in a section of the cemetery usually reserved for unbaptized children and the indigent. Agnes (Hogan) Moreland died on February 7, 1950, in Salem, Ohio. Throughout his sports career, Hogan's pastimes included trap shooting. In July 1911, when he was manager of the Lancaster Red Roses, Sporting Life reported, \\"Marty shoots targets very well and can be looked to for high scores once he gets a little shooting\\". Hogan's obituary noted that, at some point, he helped to organize the Youngstown Gun Club. Upon returning to Youngstown, Hogan supervised the athletic training of his youngest nephews, Edward and Raymond Hogan, who became sports stars at Rayen High School.The Rayen Record (Youngstown, Ohio: Rayen High School, June 1917), pp. 597-598. In the early 1920s, Edward Hogan emerged as a track and field standout at the University of Notre Dame, where he trained under coach Knute Rockne.The Dome (South Bend, Indiana: University of Notre Dame, 1924).  Final years  In the mid-1910s, Hogan permanently resettled in Youngstown, where he became athletic director of Thomas Field, a ballpark owned by the local Brier Hill Industrial Works. Prior to the enforcement of the Volstead Act, he was also employed as a clerk at Buckley & Hogan, a downtown saloon operated by his older brother, Patrick J. Hogan, Jr., and his business partner, John J. Buckley, Sr.Youngstown City Directory (Akron, Ohio: Burch Directory Co., 1917). Further research will be required to determine Martin Hogan's level of involvement, if any, in local baseball during the last decade of his life. Martin F. Hogan was only 54 years old when he died at his north side home from injuries sustained months earlier in an auto accident. Several blood transfusions failed to revive him, and a bout with pneumonia proved fatal. Funeral services for Hogan were held at St. Columba Church, and he was buried at Youngstown's Calvary Cemetery. His wife, Agnes, survived him along with his brother, Patrick. A sister, Mrs. John Dillon, had died several years earlier. Hogan's obituary in The Youngstown Daily Vindicator highlighted his contributions to organized sports, observing that many young athletes he trained and managed went on to careers in major league baseball. Major league players who worked with Hogan during his years as a minor league manager included Roy Castleton, Stan Coveleski, Lee Fohl, Sam Jones, Billy Phyle, and Louis Schettler. His disputed baserunning record remains a curious footnote in American baseball history. NotesReferences * Thorn, John; Palmer, Pete; Reuther, David (1989). Total Baseball.

A statistical model is a parameterized family of distributions: {P_\\\\theta: \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} indexed by a parameter \\\\theta. * A parametric model is a model in which the indexing parameter \\\\theta is a vector in k-dimensional Euclidean space, for some nonnegative integer k.. Thus, \\\\theta is finite-dimensional, and \\\\Theta \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^k. * With a nonparametric model, the set of possible values of the parameter \\\\theta is a subset of some space V, which is not necessarily finite-dimensional. For example, we might consider the set of all distributions with mean 0. Such spaces are vector spaces with topological structure, but may not be finite-dimensional as vector spaces. Thus, \\\\Theta \\\\subseteq V for some possibly infinite-dimensional space V. * With a semiparametric model, the parameter has both a finite-dimensional component and an infinite-dimensional component (often a real-valued function defined on the real line). Thus, \\\\Theta \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^k \\\\times V, where V is an infinite-dimensional space. It may appear at first that semiparametric models include nonparametric models, since they have an infinite-dimensional as well as a finite-dimensional component. However, a semiparametric model is considered to be \\"smaller\\" than a completely nonparametric model because we are often interested only in the finite-dimensional component of \\\\theta. That is, the infinite-dimensional component is regarded as a nuisance parameter.. In nonparametric models, by contrast, the primary interest is in estimating the infinite-dimensional parameter. Thus the estimation task is statistically harder in nonparametric models. These models often use smoothing or kernels. Example A well-known example of a semiparametric model is the Cox proportional hazards model. If we are interested in studying the time T to an event such as death due to cancer or failure of a light bulb, the Cox model specifies the following distribution function for T: : F(t) = 1 - \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\int_0^t \\\\lambda_0(u) e^{\\\\beta'x} du\\\\right), where x is the covariate vector, and \\\\beta and \\\\lambda_0(u) are unknown parameters. \\\\theta = (\\\\beta, \\\\lambda_0(u)). Here \\\\beta is finite-dimensional and is of interest; \\\\lambda_0(u) is an unknown non-negative function of time (known as the baseline hazard function) and is often a nuisance parameter.

On 1 November 2007, Anorthosis coach Temuri Ketsbaia called him lazy and said that he was 'still on vacation', implying that the midfielder had not yet displayed the calibre of football he was brought to the club for. Eventually, in January 2008, Loureiro and Anorthosis parted ways, and the player returned to Portugal, signing until the end of the season with northern Boavista FC. In July 2008, after Boavista's top flight relegation, Loureiro also dropped down a level, returning to Algarve's Portimonense and being released at the end of the campaign. After one year out of football he re-joined his first professional team Sintrense, in the fourth division. International Loureiro earned six caps for Portugal, all in 2003 and as a Gil Vicente player. His first came in the 0–2 loss to Italy on 12 February in a friendly match,Portugal frente à Itália: Muito tempo a ver jogar (Portugal against Italy: Too much time watching others play); Record, 13 February 2003 (in Portuguese) and he last played in a 4–0 win over Bolivia on 10 June, in another exhibition game.Portugal frente à Bolívia: Cabeças no ar arrasaram (Portugal against Bolivia: Heads in the air the destroyers); Record, 11 June 2003 (in Portuguese) Coaching career Starting in 2011, Loureiro managed Sintrense, C.D. Fatima, S.U. 1º de Dezembro and Casa Pia AC, all in the third tier. He was appointed at the last of them in February 2019, and won promotion on the away goals rule against S.C. Praiense before taking the championship title on 23 June with a penalty shootout win over U.D. Vilafranquense at the Estádio Nacional. For ending Casa Pia's 55-year absence from the LigaPro, Loureiro was given another year on his contract. In his first match managing in the competition, on 10 August 2019, the team lost 3–1 at S.C. Farense. He was dismissed on 24 September with the side second from bottom, just after winning for the first time in the season.

An opening statement is generally the first occasion that the trier of fact (jury or judge) has to hear from a lawyer in a trial, aside possibly from questioning during voir dire. The opening statement is generally constructed to serve as a \\"road map\\" for the fact-finder. This is especially essential, in many jury trials, since jurors (at least theoretically) know nothing at all about the case before the trial, (or if they do, they are strictly instructed by the judge to put preconceived notions aside). Though such statements may be dramatic and vivid, they must be limited to the evidence reasonably expected to be presented during the trial. Attorneys generally conclude opening statements with a reminder that at the conclusion of evidence, the attorney will return to ask the fact-finder to find in his or her client's favor. Opening statements are, in theory, not allowed to be argumentative, or suggest the inferences that fact-finders should draw from the evidence they will hear. In actual practice, the line between statement and argument is often unclear and many attorneys will infuse at least a little argumentation into their opening (often prefacing borderline arguments with some variation on the phrase, \\"As we will show you...\\"). Objections, though permissible during opening statements, are very unusual, and by professional courtesy are usually reserved only for egregious conduct. Generally, the prosecution in a criminal case and plaintiff in a civil case is the first to offer an opening statement, and defendants go second. Defendants are also allowed the option of delaying their opening statement until after the close of the prosecution or plaintiff's case. Few take this option, however, so as not to allow the other party's argument to stand uncontradicted for so long. The techniques of opening statements are taught in courses on trial advocacy.Lubet, Steven; Modern Trial Advocacy, NITA, New York, NY 2004 pp. 415 et. seq., The opening statement is integrated with the overall case strategy through either a theme and theory or, with more advanced strategies, a line of effort.Dreier, A.S.; Strategy, Planning & Litigating to Win; Conatus, Boston, MA, 2012 pp. 46–73, Specific tactics that can be incorporated in an opening statement are audio-visual elements, a clear overview of the coming presentation, and using deposition testimony to highlight key information they can expect of upcoming witnesses.O'Toole, Tom (PhD) & Schmid, Jill (PhD); Tsongas Litigation Consulting.

Cobb. Filmed in CinemaScope, it was the last film Charisse did for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and the next-to-last film Taylor did for the studio; they were MGM's last two contract stars.Arnold, Jeremy (ndg) \\"Party Girl (1958)\\" TCM.com Plot Slick lawyer Thomas Farrell (Robert Taylor) has made a career of defending Chicago mobsters in court. At a party for mob boss Rico Angelo (Lee J. Cobb), he meets chorus girl Vicki Gaye (Cyd Charisse), who accepted $100 to attend the party and another $400 from another gangster, Louis Canetto (John Ireland), from his gambling winnings. Farrell gives her a ride home, each expressing disapproval at the way the other makes money. Vicki finds her roommate Joy (Myrna Hansen) dead by suicide, pregnant by a married criminal. After a long night of questioning by police, Farrell asks that Vicki be given a raise and featured number on stage at the Golden Rooster club, which Rico owns. The lawyer and Vicki begin a romance. She's struck by the way Farrell, who is lame, uses his disability to manipulate jurors while getting Canetto off on a murder charge. A surgeon is found who might be able to properly mend Farrell's hip, so he goes to Stockholm for the operation. A cold-blooded killer, Cookie La Motte (Corey Allen), is coming up for trial, but Farrell's frame of mind has changed and he would rather not defend such a man. Rico threatens violence against Vicki if the lawyer doesn't do his job. Cookie jumps bail, tired of the long wait in court, and plans to eliminate prosecuting attorney Stewart (Kent Smith) while at-large. Cookie and his men are gunned down by other racketeers, however, at an Indiana diner. Stewart decides to pressure the mob by going after anyone connected to it. He begins by placing Farrell under arrest. Canetto goes to Vicki offering to protect her, but takes her prisoner instead. The district attorney releases Farrell, hoping to smoke out the mobsters who employ him. Canetto, caught in a crossfire, is killed. Farrell then confronts Rico, but the gangster picks up a bottle of acid that he intends to disfigure Vicki with if the lawyer refuses to do what he says. A fight erupts, with the bottle smashing into Rico's face. Eyes and face burning, he plunges from a window to his death. Cast Cast notes *Gloria Wood providing the singing voice of Cyd Charisse *Erich von Stroheim Jr., the son of the noted director, has a bit part as a police lieutenant, as was also the assistant director on the film. *Party Girl was Cyd Charisse's last film for MGM after 14 years at the studio. It was also Robert Taylor's next-to-last film in his 25 years at the studio, although it was the last to be shot in Hollywood: his final film, The House of the Seven Hawks was shot in England. Charisse and Taylor were the last two contract stars at MGM. Production The song under the opening credits, \\"Party Girl\\", was written by Nicholas Brodszky (music) and Sammy Cahn (lyrics), and was sung by Tony Martin, who was Cyd Charisse's husband. Robert Taylor's character, Tom Farrell is loosely based on Dixie Davis, who was a lawyer for mob boss Dutch Schultz and later became an informant, although film noir historian Eddie Muller claims that Louie Cuttner, a lawyer for Al Capone, was the model. Coincidentally, director Nicholas Ray would end up hiring Cuttner some years later, having no idea of the connection. Ray was impressed with the way Taylor worked, comparing him favorably with Method actors, citing Taylor's conferring with an osteologist to gather information on how Tom Farrell's limp could be realistically portrayed. According to Eddie Muller, Lee J. Cobb's character, Rico Angelo, is a \\"not too veiled caricature of Al Capone\\". The scene where Angelo beats up Frankie Gasto - played uncredited by former wrestler Aaron \\"Lord Spears\\" Saxon - was based on an incident supposedly involving Capone; it was also used by David Mamet in his screenplay for the 1987 film The Untouchables.Muller, Eddie (July 8, 2018) Outro to Turner Classic Movie's presentation of Party Girl Making Party Girl was not a good experience for Ray. Having had problems with his last two, independently- produced films, and physically debilitated by the experiences, he signed to direct a studio film for MGM in order to get the security of one of the major Hollywood studios, and to work again with an earlier collaborator, Charles Schnee; the two had worked together on 1948's They Live by Night, and Schnee was scheduled to be the producer of Party Girl. MGM was interested in Ray because he had grown up and gone to college in Chicago during Prohibition and could recreate the atmosphere of the time and place, which Ray was eager to do. Schnee, however, was replaced by Joe Pasternak, a specialist in musicals, and Ray discovered that he had little input into the writing of the script, which was already finished when he signed on, by comedy specialist George Wells. Ray was barred by MGM's protocols from being involved in the direction of the musical numbers, even to the extent of discussing her character in relation to the numbers. Ray also wanted to use period music to help recreate the era, but MGM, concerned that it would limit the film's public appeal, rejected that idea. Ray had also planned on three days of location shooting in Chicago, but when the film went past its schedule - partly because of the musicians' strike, partly due to a prolonged illness to Charisse - these days were cancelled. In the end, Ray had limited input into the film, besides personal directorial style. Ray said about the film: > When I couldn't contribute as much as I wanted to the script, I tried to do > the next best thing in color and performance, to [capture] the kind of > bizarre reality [of the time], which permitted people who lived that life to > believe that theirs was the only reality. Film noir historian Eddie Muller called Ray's use of color in Party Girl \\"nothing short of dazzling\\". Musical numbers The musical numbers were choreographed by Robert Sidney, who was forced to rehearse in Mexico with stand-ins because of a musicians' strike which ultimately caused the studios to disband their in-house orchestras. When Charisse filmed her numbers, she danced to a pre-recorded drum track in one case, and to performers who were miming in the other. After the strike was settled, Andre Previn composed the music, uncredited. Director Ray was not allowed to direct the musical numbers, because MGM's policy was that musical numbers were directed by the choreographer. He was not even allowed to talk to Charisse about her acting when it concerned the numbers.Muller, Eddie (July 8, 2018) Introduction to Turner Classic Movie's presentation of Party Girl Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $1,130,000 in the US and Canada and $1,250,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $454,000. Critical response At the time of its release, critical response to Party Girl in the United States was generally dismissive, but European critics saw it as confirming their view that director Nicholas Ray was a master of \\"mise-en-scene\\". A. H. Weiler, film critic for The New York Times, gave the film a mixed review: \\"Party Girl, it should be noted at once, is handsomely accoutered in color and CinemaScope and professionally handled by Nicholas Ray, director, and Joe Pasternak, producer, who approach their subject as if the explosive Chicago of the early Thirties was something they had just discovered. The fact is that Party Girl, like the Charleston, is old hat, an old hat that would be amusing if it weren't so frighteningly reminiscent of a past best forgotten ... There is little that is novel or exciting about this Party Girl, despite her trappings or the occasional gunplay that surrounds her. TV Guide's review praised the performances: \\"Party Girl offers only a standard story, but director Ray makes more of it through clever setups and inventive techniques, drawing forth excellent performances from Taylor (who is playing a role loosely based on Dixie Davis, lawyer for mob boss Dutch Schultz of New York, who later turned informant and married a beautiful showgirl). Cobb turns in a \\"Wild-Man-of- Borneo\\" performance wherein he not only eats the scenery but spits it out and chews on it again and again. Charisse, who performs two sensuous nightclub dances, does a commendable job with her cliché role.\\" Film critic Bruce Eder liked the film and wrote, \\"Party Girl is regarded by many Nicholas Ray fans as the most beautiful looking of all of his films. Shot in CinemaScope and color, and starring Cyd Charisse (with Robert Taylor), it gave cinematographer Robert J. Bronner one of the best showcases he ever had for his work, and was a treat to the eye of the viewer, a veritable explosion of color and motion for many of its best sequences.\\". Film critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \\"Ray does wonders with George Wells' slight script through his masterful use of the camera to evoke the characters' alienation and vulnerability, and by also including exotic dance numbers and diverting costumes he creates some stunning visuals that have an eye-catching surreal look ... It's a honey of a film, never mind the superficial flaws.\\" The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 80% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on ten reviews.Party Girl at Rotten Tomatoes. Last accessed: November 26, 2009.  DVD  This film has been released on DVD in the Warner Archive Collection (individual DVDs), but is now only available online. Novelization Slightly in advance of the film's release, as was the custom of the era, a paperback novelization of the film was published by Gold Medal Books. The author was renowned crime and western novelist Marvin H. Albert, who also made something of a cottage industry out of movie tie-ins. He seems to have been the most prolific screenplay novelizer of the late '50s through mid '60s, and, during that time, the preeminent specialist at light comedy.

He is most noted for being the former lead singer of Petra from 1979 to 1985. He also fronted the reincarnated version of the band called Classic Petra from 2010 to 2012. Biography A self-taught musician by age 13, he started his own band called The Wombats. As he grew up, he went on to share the stage with the likes of Janis Joplin, Chicago and others. He formed a band called Gideon's Bible in Indianapolis. In 1970 he became a born-again Christian. Gideon's Bible fell apart and together with drummer David Eden, Volz formed a new Jesus music band called e Band. The only studio recordings from e can be found on the rock musical two-disc LP Because I Am released in 1973. After they broke up in 1975 Volz moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he worked with legendary guitarist Phil Keaggy. He also performed the lead role in a rock stage musical called Ezekiel. Volz married Becky Britton on December 2, 1973, but ended up divorcing in the late 1990s. Volz was offered the lead singer position of REO Speedwagon in 1976 but declined due to his Christian faith. Six weeks later he was asked to participate in Petra's second album, Come and Join Us. Although at that time he participated as a guest singer on just three songs, founder/guitarist Bob Hartman (who, at that time, was sharing the lead-singing duties with co-founder/guitarist Greg Hough) offered Volz the full-time position. His first full-time album with the band, Washes Whiter Than, came in 1979. Never Say Die (1981), More Power to Ya (1982), and Not of this World (1983) followed. Petra then changed sound slightly with new keyboard player John Lawry on 1984's Beat the System and reached the pinnacle of the Volz era. They played 285 dates to 500,000 people overall on the subsequent tour and resulted in a live album, Captured in Time and Space. At the beginning of 1985 Volz was beginning to feel the strain of the heavy performing schedule over the previous four years and his family life was suffering. Volz gave nine-months notice to his band mates that he would be leaving the band at the conclusion of the tour. Volz took a year off to regroup, spend time with his family and write the material that would surface on his first solo album, The River is Rising, released in 1986 on Myrrh Records. He followed it with three other moderately successful albums. During this time, he toured with Joe English in a band called Pieces of Eight. Volz' tours drew in the 1,000 to 1,500 range during this time; a very respectable number for a contemporary Christian artist, but nowhere near the level he experienced at the end of his tenure with Petra. Volz retired for some time in the mid-90s. During this time he dealt with the divorce from his long-time wife, Becky. He resurfaced in 1998 with a string of new albums released from that year on. On October 4, 2005 he re-joined Petra for the live recording of their last project, Petra Farewell. He joined the stage with current singer, John Schlitt, for a medley of ballads, and he followed it with a solo rendition of \\"Grave Robber\\", which was one of his hits with the band. During his career, Volz lent his voice to projects by many other artists. In May 2010, a reunited version of Petra was formed with its 1984-85 lineup, under the name of Classic Petra. They released an album called Back to the Rock featuring new material and re-recordings of hits from that era.

It is surrounded by the parishes of Antrobus, Comberbach, Little Leigh and Dutton. It also borders Daresbury in Halton borough as well as Hatton and Stretton in Warrington borough. It is a small village located next to Antrobus. Map of civil parish of Whitley within the former borough of Vale Royal The civil parish was created on 1 April 1936 based on Whitley Inferior and Whitley Superior, now known as Lower Whitley and Higher Whitley. Whitley lies mostly in the northern part of a triangle of land bounded by the A49 (Warrington to Whitchurch) to the west, the A559 (Warrington to Northwich) to the east and the A533 (Runcorn to Northwich) to the south.  Transport  Roads All public roads in the village are maintained by Cheshire West and Chester council. The A49 Tarporley Road is a single carriageway primary road (formerly a trunk road). Between the world wars the Lower Whitley By-Pass was constructed, the old route being called Street Lane. The A559 Northwich Road has always been a county road and is generally a narrower road. Just half a mile to the north of the parish is the M56 North Cheshire Motorway. Buses Buses run through the village from Warrington to Northwich and vice versa. These are operated by Warrington Borough Transport, although Cheshire West and Chester Council do subsidise the service. In 2006 the services running through Weaverham and Little Leigh were discontinued. This means no bus services now run along the A49 through Whitley, though they still run on the A559.  Public houses  Whitley has two public houses, the Chetwode Arms on Street Lane (the old A49) and the Birch and Bottle on Northwich Road. Both were owned by Greenall Whitley & Co until it moved away from pubs in the 1990s, as was a third pub, The Millstone on Grimsditch Lane, now closed.  Education  Whitley Village School is a primary school providing infant and junior education for the children of Whitley and Dutton. Secondary education is currently provided by Weaverham High School. Previously it was in the catchment area of The County High School Leftwich (formerly Leftwich High School). Previously to this children went to Broomfields High School, now part of Bridgewater High School.

Altbayern in red in a modern map Altbayern mainly consists of the following Bavarian Regierungsbezirke (administrative regions): * Upper Bavaria (Oberbayern) * Lower Bavaria (Niederbayern) * Upper Palatinate (Oberpfalz) Since the term Altbayern is based on the cultural difference compared to Franconia (i.e. Upper, Middle and Lower Franconia) as well as with Swabia (i.e. Bavarian Swabia), some areas surrounding the Upper Franconian town of Wunsiedel as well as the Swabian Aichach-Friedberg district are counted as part of Altbayern, because they share the same history, dialect and culture as the three previously mentioned districts. Strictly speaking, the Upper Austrian Innviertel also belongs to Altbayern, since it was part of the Bavarian electorate until it was attached to the Archduchy of Austria according to the 1779 Treaty of Teschen. The State of \\"Baiern\\" has been called \\"Bayern\\" since the reign of King Ludwig I (1825-1848). With the beginning of his reign 1825 the official spelling of Bavaria was changed from \\"Baiern\\" to \\"Bayern\\" because of the king's love for Ancient Greek culture. Ideally, the term \\"Baiern\\" would be a logical description for the \\"Altbayern\\" region, but since there is no difference in sound between the words \\"Baiern\\" and \\"Bayern\\" and there is still a great danger of confusing them in writing, the term \\"Altbayern\\" is used. The Franconian and Swabian territories were not merged into the Kingdom of Bavaria until the German mediatisation and the 1815 Congress of Vienna, hence they still have strong cultural as well as linguistic differences from Altbayern. Bavarian dialects are spoken in Altbayern (and in the adjacent Austrian lands), as distinct from East Franconian and Alemannic (Swabian) in the Franconian regions and Bavarian Swabia. On Bayerischer Rundfunk television a regular program called \\"Schwaben & Altbayern\\" discusses current political and cultural topics of Bavaria's southern regions.

Anacrusis was one of the first bands to attempt to blend thrash and progressive metal. Their albums Manic Impressions and Screams and Whispers are considered as classics of the progressive thrash metal / prog metal genre. History Anacrusis' first demo, Annihilation Complete was voted Best Demo of 1987 by the readers of Metal Forces magazine and was later included in the publication's Demolition... Scream Your Brains Out! compilation album. This led to a deal with England-based indie Active Records, for whom the group created its first album, Suffering Hour, the following year on a meager $1,200 budget in just under a week. The following Reason album began revealing signs of the band's popular sound. Anacrusis toured in support of the band D.R.I., but without an album released on an American label, the drummer Mike Owen left to join the United States Navy shortly after they returned home. Former Heaven's Flame member Chad Smith took over the drums, while the band was eventually signed to the American label Metal Blade Records. In 1991, Manic Impressions was their first proper studio recorded album, recorded at Royal Recorders in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. A 38-city U.S. tour supporting Overkill and Galactic Cowboys followed a handful of Midwestern dates opening for Megadeth earlier in the year. After the tour, on returning to St. Louis, they devoted the next few months to writing new material, and after replacing Smith with drummer Paul Miles, work finally began on their 1993 album Screams and Whispers. This was their final album, as the band broke up after its release. In 2009, the band announced that the original line-up of Kenn Nardi, Kevin Heidbreder, John Emery and Mike Owen would reunite for a performance at the 2010 Keep It True XIII Festival in Germany. Also in 2009, the band released a CD/DVD anthology of early material on Stormspell Records. The package included their 1987 \\"Annihilation Complete\\" demo along with other demos, rehearsal recordings and early live footage. In preparation for their first festival appearance in 17 years, Anacrusis played a reunion gig at T. Billy Buffet's, St. Louis, on April 18, 2010. The show was recorded and filmed for a later release on DVD. Also in 2010 they released a 2-disc set titled Hindsight: Suffering Hour & Reason Revisited, which contains re-recorded versions of their first two albums. On April 23, 2010, Anacrusis gave a performance at Germany's Keep It True XIII festival at Tauberfrankenhalle in Lauda- Königshofen. Later that year, the band announced they had decided to play more shows. During the year 2010 the band worked on some new material, but by now just one new song \\"This Killer in my House\\" was released on the \\"Silver Ag47 - Best of Anacrusis\\" CD. On February 26, 2011, the band played a headliner show at the Firebird in St. Louis. On June 12, 2011, Anacrusis played at \\"Rock Hard Festival\\" in Germany. The whole festival was filmed by German TV - WDR Rockpalast -, to be broadcast on German television. The band last played at Skullfest, St. Louis, on June 24–25, 2011, and Alcatraz festival in Belgium, on August 27, 2011. On July 11th 2019 it was announced that Anacrusis would play a one off reunion show in December in their home state of Missouri to celebrate the reissue’s of all 4 of their albums with one part of the show being with drummer Mike Owen, one part with Chad Smith, and the last with Paul Miles.

His thin build, short stature and playing style were reminiscent of compatriot Osvaldo Ardiles. What the player – nicknamed Pipi – lacked in physical strength, he made up for with dribbling ability. Romagnoli started and finished his career with San Lorenzo, but also spent four seasons in Portugal with Sporting. Club career Born in Buenos Aires, Romagnoli made his professional debut on 13 December 1998 at the age of only 17, appearing for San Lorenzo de Almagro against Racing Club de Avellaneda. He went on to become an essential attacking player for the side, appearing in roughly 200 official games and winning three major titles. Amid San Lorenzo's financial troubles, he was linked with a move to Bundesliga side Werder Bremen in summer 2002. In January 2005, Romagnoli signed with Mexico's Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz but, in the same month of the following year, he was on the move again, now to Sporting CP, first on loan. He initially found it difficult to adjust to his new team, but eventually came into his own in the 2006–07 campaign in a superb end-of-season run for both club and player, winning the Portuguese Cup; the move was made permanent in that summer. After having appeared in only 16 matches in 2008–09, being out of favour with manager Paulo Bento, Romagnoli left the Estádio José Alvalade in early August 2009 to rejoin San Lorenzo. He contributed with ten appearances as they won their first Copa Libertadores in 2014. On 24 June 2017, 36-year- old Romagnoli renewed his contract at the Estadio Pedro Bidegain for one more season. He announced his retirement one year later, remaining tied to the club as director of football. International career Romagnoli was part of the Argentina under-20 team that won the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship.

Coarse bouldery levees form the channel sides. Poorly sorted rocks lie on the channel floor. Debris flow in Saint-Julien-Mont-Denis, France, July 2013 Scars formed by debris flow in Ventura, greater Los Angeles during the winter of 1983. The photograph was taken within several months of the debris flows occurring.D.M. Morton, R.M. Alvarez, and R.H. Campbell. \\"PRELIMINARY SOIL-SLIP SUSCEPTIBILITY MAPS, SOUTHWESTERN CALIFORNIA\\" (Open-File Report OF 03-17 USGS 2003) Debris flows are geological phenomena in which water-laden masses of soil and fragmented rock rush down mountainsides, funnel into stream channels, entrain objects in their paths, and form thick, muddy deposits on valley floors. They generally have bulk densities comparable to those of rock avalanches and other types of landslides (roughly 2000 kilograms per cubic meter), but owing to widespread sediment liquefaction caused by high pore-fluid pressures, they can flow almost as fluidly as water. Debris flows descending steep channels commonly attain speeds that surpass 10 m/s (36 km/h), although some large flows can reach speeds that are much greater. Debris flows with volumes ranging up to about 100,000 cubic meters occur frequently in mountainous regions worldwide. The largest prehistoric flows have had volumes exceeding 1 billion cubic meters (i.e., 1 cubic kilometer). As a result of their high sediment concentrations and mobility, debris flows can be very destructive. Notable debris-flow disasters of the twentieth century involved more than 20,000 fatalities in Armero, Colombia in 1985 and tens of thousands in Vargas State, Venezuela in 1999. Features and behavior Debris flows have volumetric sediment concentrations exceeding about 40 to 50%, and the remainder of a flow's volume consists of water. By definition, “debris” includes sediment grains with diverse shapes and sizes, commonly ranging from microscopic clay particles to great boulders. Media reports often use the term mudflow to describe debris flows, but true mudflows are composed mostly of grains smaller than sand. On Earth's land surface, mudflows are far less common than debris flows. However, underwater mudflows are prevalent on submarine continental margins, where they may spawn turbidity currents. Debris flows in forested regions can contain large quantities of woody debris such as logs and tree stumps. Sediment-rich water floods with solid concentrations ranging from about 10 to 40% behave somewhat differently from debris flows and are known as hyperconcentrated floods.Pierson, Thomas C. Distinguishing between debris flows and floods from field evidence in small watersheds. US Department of the Interior, US Geological Survey, 2005. Normal stream flows contain even lower concentrations of sediment. Debris flows can be triggered by intense rainfall or snowmelt, by dam-break or glacial outburst floods, or by landsliding that may or may not be associated with intense rain or earthquakes. In all cases the chief conditions required for debris flow initiation include the presence of slopes steeper than about 25 degrees, the availability of abundant loose sediment, soil, or weathered rock, and sufficient water to bring this loose material to a state of almost complete saturation (with all the pore space filled). Debris flows can be more frequent following forest and brush fires, as experience in southern California demonstrates. They pose a significant hazard in many steep, mountainous areas, and have received particular attention in Japan, China, Taiwan, USA, Canada, New Zealand, the Philippines, the European Alps, Russia, and Kazakhstan. In Japan a large debris flow or landslide is called yamatsunami (山津波), literally mountain tsunami. Ancient debris flow deposit at Resting Springs Pass, California Debris flows are accelerated downhill by gravity and tend to follow steep mountain channels that debouche onto alluvial fans or floodplains. The front, or 'head' of a debris-flow surge often contains an abundance of coarse material such as boulders and logs that impart a great deal of friction. Trailing behind the high-friction flow head is a lower-friction, mostly liquefied flow body that contains a higher percentage of sand, silt and clay. These fine sediments help retain high pore-fluid pressures that enhance debris-flow mobility. In some cases the flow body is followed by a more watery tail that transitions into a hyperconcentrated stream flow. Debris flows tend to move in a series of pulses, or discrete surges, wherein each pulse or surge has a distinctive head, body and tail. A debris flow in Ladakh, triggered by storms in 2010. It has poor sorting and levees. Steep source catchment is visible in background. Debris-flow deposits are readily recognizable in the field. They make up significant percentages of many alluvial fans and debris cones along steep mountain fronts. Fully exposed deposits commonly have lobate forms with boulder-rich snouts, and the lateral margins of debris-flow deposits and paths are commonly marked by the presence of boulder-rich lateral levees. These natural levees form when relatively mobile, liquefied, fine-grained debris in the body of debris flows shoulders aside coarse, high-friction debris that collects in debris-flow heads as a consequence of grain-size segregation (a familiar phenomenon in granular mechanics). Lateral levees can confine the paths of ensuing debris flows, and the presence of older levees provides some idea of the magnitudes of previous debris flows in a particular area. Through dating of trees growing on such deposits, the approximate frequency of destructive debris flows can be estimated. This is important information for land development in areas where debris flows are common. Ancient debris-flow deposits that are exposed only in outcrops are more difficult to recognize, but are commonly typified by juxtaposition of grains with greatly differing shapes and sizes. This poor sorting of sediment grains distinguishes debris- flow deposits from most water-laid sediments. Types Other geological flows that can be described as debris flows are typically given more specific names. These include: Lahar A lahar is a debris flow related in some way to volcanic activity, either directly as a result of an eruption, or indirectly by the collapse of loose material on the flanks of a volcano. A variety of phenomena may trigger a lahar, including melting of glacial ice, intense rainfall on loose pyroclastic material, or the outburst of a lake that was previously dammed by pyroclastic or glacial sediments. The word lahar is of Indonesian origin, but is now routinely used by geologists worldwide to describe volcanogenic debris flows. Nearly all of Earth's largest, most destructive debris flows are lahars that originate on volcanoes. An example is the lahar that inundated the city of Armero, Colombia. Jökulhlaup A jökulhlaup is a glacial outburst flood. Jökulhlaup is an Icelandic word, and in Iceland many glacial outburst floods are triggered by sub-glacial volcanic eruptions. (Iceland sits atop the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is formed by a chain of mostly submarine volcanoes). Elsewhere, a more common cause of jökulhlaups is the breaching of ice-dammed or moraine-dammed lakes. Such breaching events are often caused by the sudden calving of glacier ice into a lake, which then causes a displacement wave to breach a moraine or ice dam. Downvalley of the breach point, a jökulhlaup may increase greatly in size through entrainment of loose sediment from the valley through which it travels. Ample entrainment can enable the flood to transform to a debris flow. Travel distances may exceed 100 km. Theories and models of debris flows Numerous different approaches have been used to model debris-flow properties, kinematics, and dynamics. Some are listed here. *Rheologically based models that apply to mud flows treat debris flows as single-phase homogeneous materials (Examples include: Bingham, viscoplastic, Bagnold-type dilatant fluid, thixotropic, etc.) * Dam break wave, e.g. Hunt,Hunt,B. (1982). \\"Asymptotic Solution for Dam-Break Problems.\\" Jl of Hyd. Div., Proceedings, ASCE, Vol. 108, No. HY1, pp. 115–126. Chanson et al. * Roll wave, e.g., Takahashi,Takahashi, T., 1981.

A new explanation for debris flow surge phenomena (abstract), Eos Trans. AGU, 74(16), Spring Meet. Suppl., 154. Two-phase The mixture theory, originally proposed by Iverson and later adopted and modified by others, treats debris flows as two-phase solid-fluid mixtures. In real two- phase (debris) mass flows there exists a strong coupling between the solid and the fluid momentum transfer, where the solid's normal stress is reduced by buoyancy, which in turn diminishes the frictional resistance, enhances the pressure gradient, and reduces the drag on the solid component. Buoyancy is an important aspect of two-phase debris flow, because it enhances flow mobility (longer travel distances) by reducing the frictional resistance in the mixture. Buoyancy is present as long as there is fluid in the mixture. It reduces the solid normal stress, solid lateral normal stresses, and the basal shear stress (thus, frictional resistance) by a factor ( 1-\\\\gamma ), where \\\\gamma is the density ratio between the fluid and the solid phases. The effect is substantial when the density ratio (\\\\gamma ) is large (e.g., in the natural debris flow). If the flow is neutrally buoyant, i.e., \\\\gamma = 1, (see, e.g., Bagnold, 1954) the debris mass is fluidized and moves longer travel distances. This can happen in highly viscous natural debris flows. For neutrally buoyant flows, Coulomb friction disappears, the lateral solid pressure gradient vanishes, the drag coefficient is zero, and the basal slope effect on the solid phase also vanishes. In this limiting case, the only remaining solid force is due to gravity, and thus the force associated with buoyancy. Under these conditions of hydrodynamic support of the particles by the fluid, the debris mass is fully fluidized (or lubricated) and moves very economically, promoting long travel distances. Compared to buoyant flow, the neutrally buoyant flow shows completely different behaviour. For the latter case, the solid and fluid phases move together, the debris bulk mass is fluidized, the front moves substantially farther, the tail lags behind, and the overall flow height is also reduced. When \\\\gamma = 0, the flow does not experience any buoyancy effect. Then the effective frictional shear stress for the solid phase is that of pure granular flow. In this case the force due to the pressure gradient is altered, the drag is high and the effect of the virtual mass disappears in the solid momentum. All this leads to slowing down the motion. Almaty, Kazakhstan, after the catastrophic debris flow of 1921. A number of facilities, including the Medeu Dam, have been built since to prevent flows of this kind from reaching the city. Damage prevention To prevent debris flows reaching property and people, a debris basin may be constructed. Debris basins are designed to protect soil and water resources or to prevent downstream damage. Such constructions are considered to be a last resort because they are expensive to construct and require commitment to annual maintenance.. Also, debris basins may only retain debris flows from a fraction of streams that drain mountainous terrain. Before a storm that can potentially nucleate debris flows, forecasting frameworks can often quantify the likelihood that a debris flow might occur in a watershed Staley, D.M., Negri, J.A., Kean, J.W., Laber, J.L., Tillery, A.C. and Youberg, A.M., 2017. Prediction of spatially explicit rainfall intensity–duration thresholds for post-fire debris-flow generation in the western United States. Geomorphology, 278, pp.149-162.; however, it remains challenging to predict the amount of sediment mobilized and therefore, the total size of debris flows that may nucleate for a given storm, and whether or not debris basins will have the capacity to protect downstream communities. These challenges make debris flows particularly dangerous to mountain front communities.Kean, J.W., Staley, D.M., Lancaster, J.T., Rengers, F.K., Swanson, B.J., Coe, J.A., Hernandez, J.L., Sigman, A.J., Allstadt, K.E. and Lindsay, D.N., 2019.

In October 2018, following the completion of new Žeželj Bridge, dismantling of Boško Perošević Bridge began. As of March 2019, the first phase of bridge dismantling was finished.

In 1968, he created the Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique at the Paris School of Mines in Fontainebleau. He is known for his contributions on Kriging and mathematical morphology. His seminal work is posted for study and review to the Online Library of the Centre de Géostatistique, Fontainebleau, France. Early career Matheron graduated from École Polytechnique and later Ecole des Mines de Paris, where he studied mathematics, physics and probability theory (as a student of Paul Lévy). From 1954 to 1963, he worked with the French Geological Survey in Algeria and France, and was influenced by the works of Krige, Sichel, and de Wijs, from the South African school, on the gold deposits of the Witwatersrand. This influence led him to develop the major concepts of the theory for estimating resources he named Geostatistics. Geostatistics Matheron’s [Formule des Minerais Connexes] became his Note Statistique No 1. In this paper of November 25, 1954, Matheron derived the degree of associative dependence between lead and silver grades of core samples. In his Rectificatif of January 13, 1955, he revised the arithmetic mean lead and silver grades because his core samples varied in length. He did derive the length-weighted average lead and silver grades but failed to derive the variances of his weighted averages. Neither did he derive the degree of associative dependence between metal grades of ordered core samples as a measure for spatial dependence between ordered core samples. He did not disclose his primary data set and worked mostly with symbols rather than real measured values such test results for lead and silver in Matheron's core samples. Matheron's Interprétations des corrélations entre variables aléatoires lognormales of November 29, 1954, was marked Note statistisque No 2. In this paper, Matheron explored lognormal variables and set the stage for statistics by symbols. Primary data would have allowed him to assess whether or not lead and silver grades departed from the lognormal distribution, or displayed spatial dependence along core samples in his borehole. Matheron coined the eponym krigeage (Kriging) for the first time in his 1960 Krigeage d’un Panneau Rectangulaire par sa Périphérie. In this Note géostatistique No 28, Matheron derived k*, his estimateur and a precursor to the kriged estimate or kriged estimator. In mathematical statistics, Matheron’s k* is the length-weighted average grade of a single panneau in his set. What Matheron failed to derive in this paper was var(k*), the variance of his estimateur. Matheron presented his Stationary Random Function at the first colloquium on geostatistics in the USA. He called on Brownian motion to conjecture the continuity of his Riemann integral but did not explain what Brownian motion and ore deposits have in common. Matheron, unlike John von Neumann in 1941 and Anders Hald in 1952, never worked with Riemann sums. It was not Professor Dr Georges Matheron but Dr Frederik P Agterberg who derived the distance-weighted average of a set of measured values determined in samples selected at positions with different coordinates in a sample space. What Agterberg did not do was derive the variance of this function. Matheron did indeed derive length-weighted average grades of core samples and ore blocks but did not derive the variance of these functions. In time, the length-weighted average grade for Matheron's three-dimensional block grade was replaced with the distance-weighted average grade for Agterberg's zero- dimensional point. Both central values turned into honorific kriged estimates or kriged estimators. An infinite set of Agterberg's zero dimensional points fits within any ore block, along any borehole, or inside any sampling unit or sample space. Matheron's block grades and Agterberg's point grades are unique because both are functions without variances. Mathematical morphology In 1964, Matheron was supervising the PhD thesis of Jean Serra, dedicated to quantifying the ore properties of the iron deposit of Lorraine. Serra came up with the idea of using structuring elements for the analysis, which led to the concept of hit-or-miss transform. The theoretical analysis of this transform led Matheron to derive and investigate the concepts of erosion, dilation, opening and closing, which became known later as the basic morphological operators. He also developed a tool for granulometry, i.e., the computation of a \\"size distribution\\", where he mathematically characterizes the concept of size. In December 1964, Matheron and Serra, together with Philippe Formery, named this approach mathematical morphology. It has since evolved into a theory and method that is applied in a variety of image processing problems and tasks, and is researched worldwideSee, e.g., (Serra and Soille (Eds.) 1994) (main article: Mathematical morphology). Matheron continued to contribute to mathematical morphology during the years, his best-known contribution being the morphological filtering theory, which he developed with Serra in the 1980s. Matheron Lecture Award was established by the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences (IAMG). This award was named after Georges Matheron. Matheron Lecturers will be selected by a small committee chaired by the IAMG Vice President. The Georges Matheron Lectures will be held annually during IAMG Conferences and during International Geological Congresses. Each year IAMG selects a Georges Matheron Lecturer who is a scientist with proven research ability in the field of spatial statistics or mathematical morphology. Beginning at IAMG’2006 in Liège, Jean Serra was the first recipient of this award in 2006, delivered the first Georges Matheron Lecture. The Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique In 1968, the Paris School of Mines created the Centre de Morphologie Mathématique, located in Fontainebleau, France, and named Matheron its first director. In 1979, the center was renamed Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique, and, in 1986, the latter was split into two separate centers: Centre de Géostatistique, directed by Matheron, and Centre de Morphologie Mathématique, directed by Serra.

Along with competing product Action Replay, it is one of the few currently supported video game cheat devices. History Originally developed by the Fire International Group and distributed by Pelican Accessories as the NTSC/UC (North American) counterpart to the PAL (European) Xploder cheat device, the CodeBreaker first appeared on the Dreamcast relatively late in the console's lifecycle. Soon after the Dreamcast version was released, development began on a PlayStation 2 version. After version six hit the market, Fire International abruptly broke off their partnership with Pelican to develop the newly Mad Catz-acquired GameShark. It was also at this time that the Game Boy Advance Code Breaker was discontinued. Pelican Accessories put together an internal development team and proceeded with future versions of CodeBreaker. Their original site was www.codebreaker.com, but Codetwink bought it and had a new site. Day1 is a feature that allows you to get codes from online and import them into Codebreaker with a USB Flash drive, and the codes were removed, but CodeTwink brought them back a while after. Features Though previous versions of the PlayStation 2 Code Breaker were plagued by limited functionality, later versions were lauded for features such as a simple, uncluttered menu and \\"typing\\" systems. Version 9 added support for USB keyboards. Unlike other cheat devices which store cheat codes on proprietary storage devices, the PlayStation 2 Code Breaker stores codes on memory cards, thus cutting down on manufacturing costs. Saves can also be copied from USB flash drives. The device's official web site, Codetwink, run by CodeMasterX, (who also coded the entire cheat engine and cheat code types in the product) provides codes posted by the former Game Shark Code Creators Club. Codes can be downloaded from the official web site using the device's \\"Day1\\" feature. Later versions include support for the PlayStation 2's Broadband Adapter and internet chat. Current events Using the Code Breaker device, one can access a feature named Day1 and import/export Saves. In some cases, one can avoid typing number by number using cheats import. However, Pelican Accessories no longer supports this. Since the latest version of Codebreaker, Codebreaker 10.1, has www.codebreaker.com set as the Codebreaker site, the device can no longer connect to the Internet with it to get codes, nor use Codebreaker chat because of this site change, and because Code Breaker has been discontinued. As of May 2012, www.codetwink.com uses a vBulletin type site format, but still had the Codebreaker Day1 files available for download to people who register for an account. As of June 2013, the Day1 files were unavailable. The codetwink.com server was moved and the hard drive was damaged. As of April 2017, a mirror of the old Codetwink site is hosted by Wes Castro, developer of the Cheat Device project.http://wescastro.com/codetwink/cheats.codetwink.com/http://wescastro.com/2015/06/10/cheat- device-for-ps2/ CodeMasterX has also returned to hosting and maintaining a modern Codetwink site that also sells the \\"Game Genie\\" game save editor for Playstation 3 consoles.http://www.codetwink.com/  References  Category:Nintendo DS accessories Category:PlayStation 2 accessories Category:Video game cheating ","title":"Code Breaker"},{"id":"4415416","text":"The World Chess Network (WCN) was a commercial Internet chess server devoted to the play and discussion of chess that launched in 1997 and closed ten years later in 2007 when it was bought by Internet Chess Club and merged with Chess Live to form World Chess Live. As a typical chess server, the network provided basic services such as the conduction of live chess games over the Internet between two human players. Chess tournaments were occasionally conducted by the service, including a select few matches between known chess Grandmasters where spectators could watch the game in real-time. During its heyday, the network was frequented by professional chess players including notable Grandmasters like Elena Donaldson, Susan Polgar, Larry Christiansen and Larry Evans. Overview The World Chess Network provided a number of services to its subscribers. Besides the facilitation of online chess games, it also provided members with a method of conducting online chess tournaments. The network used the Elo rating system for rating its players. The World Chess Network also conducted professional grandmaster tournaments, allowing spectators to watch these matches live, with professional commentaries. It also advertised itself as a venue for real-world chess players seeking to improve their playing skills. The network facilitated private chess lessons from professional players, usually via arrangement with the professional player with an additional cost. It also provided a service called Banter Chess; With this service, spectators watched two Masters play a game while explaining their moves and thoughts out loud, allowing the spectators to learn how high-ranked players conduct their games. Lectures about playing chess professionally were also given by the many Masters on the site. For players not currently playing games, the network offered regular chat channels so that players could schedule or discuss games, among other things. The interface used by the website was the a proprietary chess software called Mgichess. The software has arrangements to try to detect players using the assistance of chess programs. It does this by detecting changes in window input focus, based on information on the activities being undertaken on the computer that the program is able to detect. History The World Chess Network was originally created as an Internet chess server by Master Games International, Inc. with the support of chess philanthropist Dato Tan Chin Nam. It was home to many recognized chess Grandmasters and International Masters such as Susan Polgar, Larry Christiansen and Larry Evans. In the 1999 policy board meeting of the United States Chess Federation, a proposal was made for a strategic alliance between the World Chess Network and the USCF. On 29 May 2007, WCN was bought by the Internet Chess Club. It was then merged with Chess Live, another Internet chess server acquired by Internet Chess Club from GamesParlor. The result of the acquisition and merger was the formation of World Chess Live, a new Internet chess server that merged features of both services. Coverage right The site itself has been reviewed on Chess Central, a notable online chess resource, by chess grandmaster, Susan Polgar. Polgar has also referred to the World Chess Network as a major chess \\"company\\". Another well-known online chess website, ChessBase, has featured the World Chess Network in at least one article. The article featured a match on the network between American Grandmaster (GM) Larry Christiansen and the Canadian International Master (IM) Pascal Charbonneau. The network has also received attention from other chess-specialty sites such as Chessville. The site also has been featured as a popular chess play site on About.com.

Early life Carlisle was born in London and named John Roxburgh Clark. He decided in his early teens that he wanted to become an actor. He started acting in amateur productions until he was called up for National Service. Upon his release he worked odd jobs, determined to finance an acting course at RADA. Eventually he found himself with enough money, only to discover all his hard work had been unnecessary, for he had been entitled to a council grant all along. On completion of his training at RADA, Carlisle joined Harrogate Repertory and subsequently appeared in repertory all over the country, including at Ipswich, Birmingham and Liverpool. Grand Theatre Wolverhampton: Relatively Speaking, Programme April 1968. http://www.grandmemories.co.uk/Memory.aspx?MemoryId=238&FileId;=2666#Images Television and film While appearing in repertory at Birmingham, Carlisle was spotted by an ATV casting director and asked to audition for the hospital drama series Emergency – Ward 10. Carlisle first assumed the role of the young doctor Lester Large in episode 533, in 1962. His character became a regular in the show, and Carlisle made numerous appearances including in the final episode of the long-running series in 1967. He starred alongside John Woodvine in the London Weekend Television crime series New Scotland Yard from 1972 to 1973. He played the opinionated and sometimes callous Detective Inspector (later Sergeant) Alan Ward and referred to having played the role \\"in kind of a Gestapo way, beating up criminals and things like that\\". The portrayal led to letters of complaint, so that the character was toned down in subsequent series.\\"British TV soap actor switches to Shakespeare\\" in Record Journal, 30 November 1984, p. 17. In 1979, Carlisle appeared in the BBC series The Omega Factor as the morally ambiguous psychiatrist Dr. Roy Martindale. He also made one-off appearances in series such as The Avengers, Z-Cars, Strange Report, Dixon of Dock Green, Lovejoy, The Black Adder, Hustle, Holby City, Robin Hood, The Catherine Tate Show, Midsomer Murders, Between the Lines, The Inspector Alleyn Mysteries, \\"The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes and Doctors. On film, Carlisle played the elderly Private Mirus in the 2001 horror film The Bunker. He also had small roles in Richard E. Grant's Wah-Wah (2005) and in Forget Me Not (2010). Carlisle died in London, aged 76. Later work in theatre Carlisle joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1979, rather unusually for an actor who until then had predominantly worked in television. He then performed extensively on stage (see 'Selected stage work'). He appeared on Broadway in the RSC productions Cyrano de Bergerac, Much Ado About Nothing (both 1985) and The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (1986) as well as A Doll's House (1997). As an Associate Artist with the RSC he appeared in a great number of plays, including The Taming of the Shrew, Love's Labour's Lost, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Seagull and Per Gynt. In later years he worked prominently at the National Theatre.

Initially a part of the Polish Legions in World War I, after the war it was incorporated into the Polish Army. Disbanded after the Invasion of Poland in 1939, it was recreated during the Armia Krajowa's Operation Tempest. The regiment was first formed in 1914 in Kraków, as part of the Polish Legions fighting alongside the Austro-Hungarian Army. Initially a part of the Eastern Legion, with time it was joined with the 2nd Brigade of the Polish Legions. It avoided destruction on the fronts of the Great War and was merged into the newly reborn Polish Army in 1918. It took part in the Polish-Bolshevik War. After the Peace of Riga had been signed, the unit was partly demobilized and stationed in Sandomierz, where it formed a part of the Polish 2nd Legions' Infantry Division. With that unit the regiment, headed by Col. Ludwik Czyżewski, formed the backbone of the Piotrków Operational Group at the start of the Invasion of Poland in 1939. Initially separated from its division, the regiment fought in the battle of Borowa Góra on 5 September. On 9 September it joined its division and covered its retreat towards Warsaw. After heavy fights on 12 and 13 September, fought in the area of Błonie, Ołtarzew and Ożarów, the regiment crossed the Kampinos Forest and reached the Modlin Fortress. There, the regiment took part in defence of that area until the capitulation of the fortress on 29 September. In August 1944, during the Operation Tempest, the 2nd Regiment was recreated from smaller partisan units as part of the 2nd Division fighting in the area of Sandomierz and Opatów. Commanded by Lt.Col. Antoni Wiktorowski Kruk, it fought against the German Army in that area until September, when it was disbanded. However, its sub-units continued to operate in the area until January 1945, when they were overrun by the Red Army. Most of its soldiers, much like the rest of Armia Krajowa, were then rounded up by the NKVD, disarmed and either forcibly conscripted to the Communist-supported Polish People's Army or sent to the Gulags in USSR.

He played college football at North Carolina and was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Early years Brown was born and raised in Henderson, North Carolina where he attended Northern Vance High School, where he was a member of the National Honor Society. He was a standout not only in football but also in track and field. He holds four state championships; three in discus and one for shot put. College career Brown did not miss a game during his career at North Carolina. He was named First-team All-ACC in 2004. Brown first saw action in his freshman year at right tackle against Florida State. Brown started his career at The University of North Carolina as a tackle, then guard. He was later moved to center, where he played the remaining three years of his college career. Professional career=2005 NFL Draft Along with Chris Spencer, Brown was considered one of the best centers available in the 2005 NFL Draft. He was projected as a mid-third round pick, and was eventually selected in the fourth round (124th overall) by the Baltimore Ravens. Baltimore Ravens Jason Brown started all 16 games at guard in the 2007 season after spending 2005 and 2006 as a backup to Ravens starter Mike Flynn. He later started all 16 games in the 2008 season as a center. He was considered the best interior offensive lineman going into free agency after the end of season. St. Louis Rams Brown visited the Rams in the first day of free agency February 27, 2009. The next day, he agreed to a five-year deal worth $37.5 million, including a $20 million in guaranteed money. The deal would make Brown the highest paid center in the NFL. However, on March 10, it was reported that the contract has been disapproved by the league and the two sides were working to correct the issue. The deal was finally approved by the NFL on March 12. On March 12, 2012, Brown was released by the Rams. Free agency Brown became an unrestricted free agent and received a conservative one-year contract offer from the Baltimore Ravens and attended visits with the San Francisco 49ers and Carolina Panthers. After football Brown chose to walk away from football in 2012 at the age of 29 to become a farmer in Louisburg, North Carolina. He maintains a 1,000-acre farm called First Fruits Farm where he grows produce such as sweet potatoes and cucumbers. He donates these crops to local food pantries, having given away over 100,000 pounds of sweet potatoes and 10,000 pounds of cucumbers. Brown began learning about farming practices in 2012 by watching YouTube videos. Brown also owns and manages a special events venue called Amazing Graze Barn, which is located on the grounds of First Fruits Farm.Amazing Graze Barn - About Us, Retrieved Oct. 13, 2019.

The original section of the line ran from between a point in between Darlington and Northallerton on what is now the East Coast Main Line and the terminus at Richmond railway station. History A proposal for the branch was first mooted in 1825 and in 1836, the idea of serving Swaledale was again raised when notifications were placed in the local newspapers for the Richmond and Cleveland Railway. The branch was formally opened on the 10 September 1846 and ran from what was known originally as Dalton Junction, with the NER renaming the junction Eryholme in 1901, despite Eryholme being further away from there than Dalton was. The railway was intended to progress further up the valley to Reeth with a view to moving quarried products out of the dale. The proposal even gained parliamentary approval in 1869, but due to local support not being forthcoming, the NER never even started the venture. This venture was revisited in 1912 with a Light Railway Order being granted for the Swaledale Light Railway Company, but again this faltered and was never constructed. When trains arrived at the Richmond terminus, the procedure was to allow the passengers to alight from the train and the loco would propel the carriages out of the station and run-round the train as there was no loco release facility. When troop trains were operating, a loco would be outbased at Richmond to attach to the rear of a terminating service. This would facilitate a quick turnaround time for departure and the incoming loco could then wait in the sidings to repeat the changeover with the next terminating service. Despite the existence of the Catterick branch, most troop trains would run into Richmond and servicemen and women would be bussed into the camp. Catterick Camp Military Railway Catterick railway bridge Catterick railway bridge as seen from the road bridge The start of the First World War saw the hasty construction of a sub branch line to Catterick Camp (now Catterick Garrison) which opened in 1915. The sub branch separated near Brompton-on-Swale crossing the River Swale via Catterick Railway Bridge, which still stands parallel to the stone bridge that gives the settlement of Catterick Bridge its name. The branch then served the Catterick Garrison. The branch and all its stations were closed on 26 October 1964. Closure The line and its sub branch survived the Beeching cuts of the early 1960s largely thanks to extensive use by the military. The North Eastern region of British Railways gave notice to close the line in 1963, but the Ministry of Transport refused permission. The line between Richmond and Catterick Bridge was singled as an economy measure, but this was not enough as the line only survived a few years before succumbing to closure to passengers in 1969. Freight carried on to Catterick Bridge until 1970. The bridge that carried the Catterick railway over the A1 at Brompton-on-Swale was purchased by the Wensleydale Railway in 2015. The bridge needed to be removed due to the A1 being upgraded to A1(M) status, which involved widening the road. The redundant Fort bridge (as it is known) will be used to enable the railway to span Apedale Beck west of Redmire railway station.

Set in 19th century Japan, the player takes on the role of a rōnin who wanders into a remote village and becomes involved in a conflict between rival clans. A notable feature of the game is the branching storyline, which allows player decisions to radically alter the course of the story. An updated version titled was released in Japan in 2003. It was based on the western versions of the game, and as such, it included the non-sword weapons, bugfixes, the exit for ending the game early, hard mode, and horizontal text of those versions. The game was followed by three sequels. Way of the Samurai was also released on PlayStation Portable on September 18, 2008 in Japan, prior to the release of Way of the Samurai 3. Plot The story of Way of the Samurai takes place in 1878, after the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate and the start of the Meiji period, during the Satsuma Rebellion, a time when the samurai who were once at the top of Japanese society are all but outlawed. The game begins with the player, taking the role of a wandering rōnin by the name of Kenji, arriving in a fictional outpost called Rokkotsu Pass. Rokkotsu Pass is a sparsely populated village, whose main attractions include a railway crossing, a small restaurant, and an iron foundry. Three separate factions are competing for control of the Pass, each with their own agenda. The first is the new centralized government, whose army has been sweeping through the country securing power from the local warlords. The government army is well-funded and equipped with modern weaponry, including firearms and cannons, making them formidable opponents for the former samurai lords. The second faction is the Kurou family, who previously held sway in Rokkotsu Pass and continue to exert their influence on the people through extortion and intimidation. Led by Tesshin Kurou, the family is resisting the government's attempt to take control of the pass, however the samurai cannot compete with the modern army. In an attempt to secure funds, the Kurou intend to sell the iron foundry to the government. This decision by the Kurou puts them in direct opposition to the Akadama clan, whose leader, Kitcho, is the illegitimate son of Tesshin Kurou. The Akadama wish to expel the government forces from the pass, and plan to sabotage the Kurou family's attempt to sell the foundry. Caught in the middle of this power struggle are the village peasants, who are likely to be oppressed regardless of who is in control. Branching plot Although the story in Way of the Samurai follows the basic framework provided above, the actual events that the player participates in depend greatly on the decisions made while playing. Immediately upon entering Rokkotsu Pass, the player is confronted by a group of samurai attempting to kidnap a young girl. The player has the choice of helping the girl, joining the abductors, or ignoring the situation altogether. Each of these decisions will lead the player down a different path, resulting in a vastly different view of the main plot points. The player's decisions will also have a direct result on Kenji's allegiance within the storyline. The player may choose to join either the Kurou family or the Akadama clan, to support and protect the innocent villagers, or to take no side and observe the events as an outsider with minimal direct involvement. The player may also choose to help one faction and then switch allegiance later in the game. As a result of these branching storylines, Way of the Samurai has six different endings; the particular ending obtained by the player is based on which faction, if any, Kenji has allied himself with and the actions taken during the course of the game. Gameplay Aside from the player's direct involvement in choosing the plot, gameplay in Way of the Samurai focuses heavily on combat. Fighting is done almost entirely with various samurai swords available in the game. Way of the Samurai features over 40 different types of swords, however the player begins with access to only one. By defeating enemies, the player can then take the fallen character's sword to add to his or her own inventory. The player may only carry a maximum of three swords at a time. Once per game, the player may leave one additional sword with the swordsmith, Dojima, and have it delivered to his or her sword collection. Combat The player will often have the choice of whether or not to engage in combat with a specific non-player character, however once combat is engaged the player is likely to be forced into fighting several opponents at once. Kenji has a basic set of moves that are available with all weapons, consisting of a regular attack, a strong attack, a block, and a kick. There are numerous variations and combinations of the basic moves available depending on the particular sword equipped at the time. By defeating opponents or collecting special items Kenji can also unlock special attacks and combinations specific to each weapon. There are also several different fighting stances, depending on the particular sword equipped, each of which comes with its own fighting style. This is the only installment in the series so far that offers a versus mode for 2 players. Sword enhancement Each of the swords available in the game has several attributes which influence its effectiveness in battle. These attributes can be enhanced using special items found, or by visiting the in-game swordsmith. *Sharpness: Attack strength, increases/decreases the amount of damage caused when an opponent is struck with the sword *Flexibility: Defensive strength, increases/decreases the amount of damage suffered when the player is struck by an opponent *Durability: Sword strength, increases the amount of heat the sword can generate before breaking (heat is generated by striking or blocking, and displayed using an on-screen meter) *Life: Increases/decreases the total number of the players hit points.

Background Peter Goddard Lieberson was born in New York City. He was the son of ballerina and choreographer Vera Zorina (née Eva Brigitta Hartwig) and Goddard Lieberson, president of Columbia Records. Lieberson studied composition with Milton Babbitt, Charles Wuorinen, Donald Martino, and Martin Boykan. After completing his musical studies at Columbia University, he left New York in 1976 for Boulder, Colorado, to continue his studies with Chögyam Trungpa, a Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhist master. It was there he met and married Ellen Kearney, a fellow student of Trungpa's. At their teacher's request, the Liebersons moved from Boulder to Boston, Massachusetts, to co- direct Shambhala Training, a meditation and cultural program. Lieberson attended Brandeis University, from which he received a Ph.D. From 1984 to 1988 he taught at Harvard University. He then became international director of Halifax Shambhala Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Musical career Beginning in 1994, Lieberson devoted his time entirely to composition. He met his second wife, mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, in 1997, during the Santa Fe Opera production of his work Ashoka's Dream; they married in 1999 after Lieberson and his first wife were divorced. He wrote his song cycles Rilke Songs and Neruda Songs for Hunt Lieberson. The Neruda Songs, a cycle of songs set to love poems by Pablo Neruda, were co-commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony; the world premiere was given on May 20, 2005, by the Los Angeles Philharmonic with Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting and Hunt Lieberson as soloist. The Boston Symphony performed the work in November 2005 with Hunt Lieberson as soloist and James Levine conducting, followed by performances with the Cleveland Orchestra, Robert Spano conducting. Hunt Lieberson died of breast cancer in July 2006, aged 52. Nonesuch subsequently released a commercial recording of the Boston/Levine performance of the Neruda Songs. In December 2007, Lieberson won the 2008 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition for Neruda Songs. The Rilke Songs have also been issued, in separate studio and concert performances by Hunt Lieberson, both on the Bridge Records, Inc. label.Arkiv music website. Lieberson was commissioned by the Boston Symphony to compose another cycle of Neruda songs, which became the Songs of Love and Sorrow. When he returned to the work, it was no longer simply a memorial to Hunt Lieberson and personal farewell, but also reflected the influence of his daughters and his third wife, Rinchen Lhamo. Lieberson had three daughters from his first marriage, all of whom are members of the band TEEN. Shortly after Lorraine Hunt Lieberson died of breast cancer, Lieberson himself was diagnosed with lymphoma. Despite the debilitating effects of the illness and its treatment, Lieberson went on composing. Though thought to have achieved full remission, he died from complications of the disease in 2011 in Tel Aviv, Israel. He had been living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at the time of his death.

The company was founded in 1865, originally as the Michigan Central Woolen Company, and from the late 19th century through the first half of the 20th century was probably the single best-known manufacturer of blanket sleepers in the United States. The brand was so well known that Dr. Dentons became (and remains today) a genericized trademark. The trademark has since changed hands several times, but has remained in sporadic use by various corporate entities into recent years. The name Dr. Denton derives from Whitley Denton, an employee of the company who created the original design on which its product line was based. The appellation of \\"Doctor\\" was a marketing gimmick, intended to give the impression that the garments were designed (and implicitly endorsed) by a medical doctor. In another version, according to Elliott Saunders, a VP with Carrolls Manufacturing, who owned the Dr. Denton's brand in the 1970–80s, the garment was invented by Frank Denton, whose nickname was \\"Doc\\".

The abbey was established following the arrival in the area of monks from Saint Vincent Archabbey in Pennsylvania in 1856. Saint John's is one of the largest Benedictine abbeys in the Western Hemisphere, with 133 professed monks. The Right Reverend Fr. John Klassen, OSB, serves as the tenth abbot. A school founded at the abbey grew into Saint John's University in 1883. 17 buildings constructed at the abbey and university between 1868 and 1959 are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the St. John's Abbey and University Historic District.  Establishment  In 1856, five monks of Saint Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, arrived in St. Cloud, Minnesota, at the behest of Joseph Crétin, Bishop of St. Paul. They established the priory there and began to minister to the German immigrants in central Minnesota. One of the first ministries of the new community was Saint John's College, which would come to be known as Saint John's Preparatory School. In 1862 the community moved some miles west, into the wooded area of the valley, and again in 1865 to the shores of Lake Sagatagan. It was in this location that the community began to flourish, and in 1866 the priory was raised to the status of Abbey and the community elected Fr. Rupert Seidenbusch as the first Abbot.  Abbey Church of Saint John the Baptist  By the early 1950s the monastic community had reached to a near 450 monks, and had outgrown the original abbey church and so plans were made to construct a new, larger worship space which could accommodate a larger congregation. The liturgical movement which would culminate in the Second Vatican Council was in full swing at Saint John's and so the new church was also to be designed with some of the anticipated liturgical changes in mind. (Following the Council, almost no changes needed to be made to incorporate the new liturgical rules.) The community contacted twelve architects and asked them to submit plans for a church which would \\"be truly an architectural monument to the service of God.\\" In 1954 the community selected Marcel Breuer to design not only the new church but an addition to the monastic enclosure. Breuer's design incorporated the traditional axis of baptistery, nave, and altar in a modern concrete structure. The monastic choir stalls and Abbot's throne were placed in a less traditional semi-circular shape around the main altar, which also served to invite the congregation closer. The church was designed so that even with a capacity of over 1500, the entire community was able to feel like they were intimately involved in the liturgy. Perhaps the most striking part of the design was the facade and bell tower, which itself was shaped like a large bell and sat suspended over the main entrance of the church. The \\"banner\\" rises 112 vertical feet in front of the church and houses the 5 bells which sound the hours and call the monastic and university communities to prayer. The north facade of the building is the largest wall of stained glass in the world and contains 430 colorful hexagons of abstract design. Construction of the church began on May 19, 1958, and lasted until August 24, 1961. The church was consecrated in the fall of 1961 and serves to this day as the principal liturgical space of both the monastic community and the university. The monastic community gathers for morning prayer, midday prayer, Mass, and evening prayer every weekday and except for rare occasions these liturgies are open to the public. On the weekends there is not public midday prayer. All liturgical events in the Abbey Church are broadcast on the Abbey website, as well as through the Saint John's University on-campus cable system.  Grounds  In addition to the preparatory school, the abbey also established Saint John's University, which was connected to the abbey itself by \\"the Quadrangle\\", at the time the largest building west of the Mississippi River dedicated to education. The abbey also operates Liturgical Press, one of the foremost liturgical publishing houses in the United States. Also located on the grounds of the abbey are the Collegeville Institute for Ecumenical and Cultural Research, the Episcopal House of Prayer (Diocese of Minnesota), the original Minnesota Public Radio studio, and the Saint John the Baptist Parish Center. The grounds of the abbey comprise lakes, prairie, and hardwoods on rolling glacial moraine, and have been designated Saint John's Arboretum. The abbey is the location of a number of structures designed by the modernist Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer. The Abbey Church, with its banner bell tower, is one of his best-known works. In its undercroft is a chapel that contains the relics of Saint Peregrine. A historic district of 17 buildings at Saint John's Abbey and University was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for having national significance in the themes of architecture, community planning and development, education, and religion. It was nominated for being an architecturally and historically significant campus of a leading religious and educational institution of the Order of Saint Benedict. The abbey is the setting for The Cloister Walk, a collection of essays on Christian spirituality by Kathleen Norris. The grounds include the Episcopal House of Prayer, a retreat center affiliated with the Episcopal Church.  Ministries  Outside of St. John's, the abbey's monks serve 16 parishes along with various nursing homes and hospitals in the Diocese of Saint Cloud and in the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis. A sister priory of Saint John's, Trinity Benedictine Monastery, is located in Fujimi, Japan.  Saint John's Bible  The abbey's Hill Museum & Manuscript Library houses the world's largest collection of manuscript images. This library is also the home of The Saint John's Bible, the first completely handwritten and illuminated Bible to have been commissioned by a Benedictine monastery since the invention of the printing press.  Sexual abuse allegations  More than 250 allegations of sexual and other misconduct by over 60 members of Saint John's community have been made.  List of Abbots  # Rt. Rev. Rupert Seidenbusch, O.S.B.

It was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,882. Manor East Hagbourne's toponym is derived from Hacca's Brook, a stream that flows through the village. East Hagbourne was sometimes called Church Hagbourne. East and West Hagbourne have been separate villages since the time of Edward the Confessor, when Regenbald, a priest of Cirencester, held the manor of East Hagbourne. Regenbald continued to hold the manor after the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and compilation of the Domesday Book in 1086. Regenbald died in the reign of Henry I, who then granted East Hagbourne manor to the Augustinians Cirencester Abbey (founded 1117). The abbey continued to hold the manor until 1539, when it surrendered its lands to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Churches=Church of England Perpendicular Gothic five-light east window of the chancel The nave of the Church of England parish church of St Andrew may have been built in the 12th century. The south aisle was added early in the 13th century. It is linked with the nave by a three-bays arcade. It was followed a few years later by the south chapel, which is alongside the chancel and linked to it by a two-bay arcade. The chancel arch was built in the middle of the 13th century. The north aisle, also of three bays, was added about 1340, followed by the Decorated Gothic north chapel, which is alongside the chancel and linked with it by a two-bay arcade. On the floor of the north chapel are monumental brasses commemorating Claricia Wyndesor – quare fieri fecit istam capellam (died 1403) and her husband John York fundator istius Ile (died 1404). Nikolaus Pevsner takes this to mean that the north chapel was built early in the 15th century, which surprised him as its Decorated Gothic style had been succeeded by Perpendicular Gothic around 1350. However, the south aisle and south chapel were rebuilt in the Perpendicular Gothic style early in the 15th century so Page and Ditchfield conclude that the brasses of Clarice Windsor and John York were formerly in the south chapel and moved at a later date. The south chapel has a squint into the chancel. The chapel was re- roofed in the 17th century. The arch supporting the west bell tower is 14th- century Decorated Gothic but the style of the rest of the tower is Perpendicular Gothic. A Perpendicular Gothic clerestory was added to the nave in the 15th century. The east window of the chancel is also Perpendicular, from late in the 15th century. St Andrew's is a Grade I listed building. The tower has a ring of eight bells. Joseph Carter of Reading cast the third bell in 1602. Ellis I Knight of Reading cast the fifth and sixth bells in 1641, and Henry II Knight cast the fourth in 1670. Thomas Lester of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the seventh bell in 1751. Robert I Wells of Aldbourne, Wiltshire cast the treble bell in 1770, and his son Robert II Wells of Aldbourne cast the tenor in 1781. Mears and Stainbank at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the second bell in 1910. St Andrew's has also a Sanctus bell, cast by an unknown founder in about 1699. St Andrew's parish is part of the Benefice of the Churn. Primitive Methodist A Primitive Methodist chapel was built in East Hagbourne in the 19th century. It is a red brick building with Gothic Revival ashlar stone details. It has ceased to be used for worship and is now a private house. The Northbourne Centre in Didcot, which used to be St Peter's church, founded by the parish of St Andrew, East Hagbourne Churches in Northbourne Churches were built for Northbourne when it was still part of Hagbourne parish: St Peter's Church of England church in 1890, a Wesleyan chapel in 1901 and a Primitive Methodist chapel in 1903. St Peter's now has a new building that was completed in 1977, and its old building is the Northbourne Centre. Northbourne is now part of Didcot: see below. Secular buildings and structures Upper Cross As well as the parish church, East Hagbourne has at least 45 listed buildings. The majority of East Hagbourne's listed buildings are individual houses and cottages, particularly on Main Road and Church Close, which are mid-17th century and are all Grade II listed. The Village Cross or Upper Cross, at the junction of Main Road and Church Close, is a 15th-century stone cross with an 18th-century sundiam, on a base of 5 deep stone steps. It is Grade II* listed. Hagbourne Mill Farm Mill is early 18th century with alterations from about 1828 and is Grade II* listed. It is some way south of the village and not generally open to the public. The Phillips family tomb is a chest tomb in white and grey marble in St Andrew's parish churchyard. It is Grade II* listed. Matthew Phillips, carpenter to the King, is mentioned below. The original part of Kings Holme, 5 Main Road, was built in 1591. Tudor House, 46 Main Road, is a three-storey farmhouse with thatched barn opposite the Village Cross. It has wooden panelling in the front room and an original corkscrew staircase to the rear. Economic and social history A thatched cottage in East Hagbourne In the English Civil War in 1644, the Parliamentarian army billetted 6,000 horsemen in East Hagbourne. During this time it is believed the parish church and Upper Cross were damaged. A tiny window, only three inches square, in a house on Main Road, is said to have been used to spy on the Parliamentarian troops. On 10 March 1659 fire spread through the village, burning down a considerable number of thatched houses. In 1661 Charles II issued a proclamation requesting aid for the village. A sum was received from Londoners and, in return, East Hagbourne sent money to London after the Great Fire of London in 1666. The Hagbourne fire could explain the number of well-preserved houses from after this era. The village has numerous old timber-framed houses, both around the village cross and along the main street. Coscote Manor, about west of the village, is a timber-framed 17th-century house with fretwork bargeboards and an Ipswich window. Hagbourne Church of England Primary SchoolHagbourne Primary School is in East Hagbourne and was built in 1874. For centuries Hagbourne parish extended north as far as the main road linking Wallingford and Wantage. After the Great Western main line reached Didcot Junction in 1844, a new settlement was built in Hagbourne parish next to the boundary with Didcot. This was initially called Newtown or North Hagbourne, but later its name became Northbourne. In the 20th century both Didcot and Northbourne continued to grow. Eventually Northbourne was transferred from Hagbourne to Didcot civil parish, and St Peter's church was given its own ecclesiastical parish. Coscote Manor as pictured in Allan Fae's 1913 travel journal Quiet roads and sleepy villages The Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway was built through the parish, passing west of the village and east of Coscote on the still extant Hagbourne Embankment – one of the line's most notable civil engineering features, built upon chalk dug from the route of the line through the Berkshire Downs. The line opened in 1881. There was no station in the parish; the nearest were at Upton and . In 1911 the Great Western Railway renamed Upton station . In 1942–43 the track was doubled to carry increased war traffic, and the bridges over the West Hagbourne Road and Lake Road were rebuilt. British Railways closed the line to passenger traffic in 1962 and freight in 1967. Since December 2006 a South Didcot bypass road has been proposed. This would have required the demolition of part of East Hagbourne, particularly houses in the New Road area. The proposal is in abeyance. In 2014 the parish boundary with Didcot was moved and the land locally called Fleet Meadow was made part of the Millbrook ward of Didcot. In 2015 Grainger plc proposed a high-density housing estate of 170 homes on land south of this new boundary. East Hagbourne Parish Council and many Didcot and East Hagbourne residents oppose the development, as does local MP Ed Vaizey. The Mind the Green Gap Campaign formed in July 2015 to campaign against this and other proposals that are contrary to South Oxfordshire District Council's Core Strategy. Amenities East Hagbourne has a 17th-century public house, The Fleur de Lys.Fleur de Lys East Hagbourne has a Church of England Primary School on Main Road. Opposite the school is Hagbourne village hall, shared by East and West Hagbourne and used regularly for village events. In 2010 the building was extended with an additional meeting room, new toilets and storage. There is a small Post Office and a village shop in New Road, opened in 2001 and run by local volunteers. Transport Thames Travel route 94 serves East Hagbourne from Mondays to Fridays, linking the village with Didcot town and with Didcot Parkway railway station. Buses run mostly once an hour, with a half-hourly service in the evening peak. There is no Saturday or Sunday service. Events In 1996, 1999, 2003 and 2004 East Hagbourne was awarded the title of Best Kept Village in Oxfordshire. In 2009 the village was one of nine UK finalists in the Royal Horticultural Society’s Britain in Bloom competition. The village holds several events each year. These include an annual fun run on the May Day bank holiday, typically of to , which involves a run around the surrounding area, including the villages of Blewbury and Upton. There is an annual \\"scarecrow trail\\", a village fête and, in August, a duck race on Hacca's Brook. In recent years a Mummers Play has toured the village in December. Film and television In July 1975, the location scenes for the Doctor Who serial The Android Invasion were filmed in the village. In 1989, Tom Baker, who starred as the Doctor, returned to the village to be interviewed by Nicholas Briggs about his time on Doctor Who for the Reeltime Pictures Myth Makers series. In 2012, Briggs returned to the village to interview residents for The Village That Came to Life, a making-of documentary featured on the DVD release of The Android Invasion. In 2015, two television channels featured East Hagbourne in reports about the Mind the Green Gap Campaign.

It is located in Rustenburg, North West Province, South Africa. Location Located about 20 km north-west of Rustenburg, on the main Sun City/Pilanesberg road (R565), Boekenhoutfontein, at the Paul Kruger Country House Museum lies nestled in a valley surrounded by hills covered with lush bushveld. It boasts one of the few peat wetlands in the North-west province and can be regarded as a historical jewel in the area, is the site of many important archaeological findings from different eras. Paul Kruger Today Kruger is commemorated through the restored house of his birth near Bulhoek, his official residence in Pretoria (which is now the Kruger Museum), the simple cottage at Waterval Onder (Mpumalanga) where he lived before going into exile in Europe, the world-famous Kruger National Park and the name of the town Krugersdorp in Mogale City. However, nowhere are his love for the land and his friendly relationships with neighbouring black communities better illustrated than at Boekenhoutfontein, the farm he bought in 1859. The farm remained his property until his death, after which it was divided among three of his children. In 1971 it was declared a national monument. In 1971, the portion on which the farmstead is situated was bought from the Kruger family by the Simon van der Stel Foundation which painstakingly restored the various buildings to their former glory. Built in a neat row, the buildings bear witness to his sense of order and symmetry. Simple building methods and materials are evident, such as rough beechwood lintels, cow dung, peach pip and blood floors and roof beams fastened by dowels and leather thongs. Period furniture and authentic wallpaper have been recreated by craftsmen in Europe; Kruger's rifle is on show - possibly the one with which he killed a lion at the age of 14 - together with one of his many bibles and the bellows organ, played by his wife Gezina, plus many gifts given to him by visiting state dignitaries. Kruger occupied the Bronkhorst House, dating back to the early 1840s, while he was building his first house at Boekenhoutfontein. It is reportedly the oldest white owned dwelling in the then Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek. This property neighbours the Bafokeng nation whom Kruger befriended and persuaded to register their land rights, resulting in today's great Bafokeng wealth generated through its royalties from the platinum mines. In close proximity can be found family graves, the koppie where Kruger often sought religious guidance and the saddle in the hills where he hid his horses from the British forces. The old schoolhouse, which has served many purposes over the years, can be transformed into a simple chapel & conference room. The dams built by Kruger have also been restored and today serve as watering holes for the herds of game, which can be viewed roaming the surrounding, untouched bushveld. Some 20 years ago, the owners of Kedar Country Hotel, Conference Centre & Spa started buying farmland in area, first acquiring a portion which had been owned by Kruger's daughter, Gezina. Originally three self-catering chalets were built for visitors seeking peace and privacy in the natural bush surroundings. Over the years, adjoining land was purchased, culminating in the consolidation of an area of over 600 hectares, which has been game fenced and populated with a wide variety of game, including eland, blesbok, impala, bushbok, nyala, kudu, zebra, blue wildebeest, giraffe, pygmy hippos and soon to include sable and antelope. Working for Water has done invaluable work removing alien vegetation and restoring the wetlands, which attract a wide variety of birdlife. The main Kruger House, a museum showcasing a wide range of Kruger memorabilia, houses many items of historical interest from the Rustenburg Museum. In his last message to General Louis Botha, President Kruger said: \\"Seek in the past all that is good and beautiful, make it your ideal and make it come true in the future.\\" See also * List of Castles and Fortifications in South Africa References Category:Buildings and structures in North West (South African province) Category:Museums in North West (South African province) Category:Biographical museums in South Africa Category:Paul Kruger ","title":"Boekenhoutfontein"},{"id":"4415514","text":"The Official Logo of the Belize Commonwealth Games Association Belize was represented at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.

It is typically no more than 5.5 inches (14 centimetres) long and about half an inch (1.25 centimetres) in diameter, slightly thicker or the same size as a marker pen. The material is usually of a hard high-impact plastic (e.g. Lexan). The body of the Kubotan is lined with six round grooves with a screw eye or swivel and split ring attachment at one end for keys.  History  The Kubotan keychain was originally based on a small bamboo weapon called the \\"hashi stick\\", an invention by Kubota's father Denjiro. Its popularity grew in 1969 to 1970s when Kubota, at the request of California State Senator Edward M. Davis then former Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, created the weapon and began training female officers in its application. It is often touted as extremely effective in breaking the will of unruly suspects with painful locks and pressure point strikes. Because of this, the Kubotan is also sometimes dubbed the 'instrument of attitude adjustment'. Concept Applied as a weapon, some of its usage can be similar to that of the yawara stick or koppo stick. The principal targets in self-defence include bony, fleshy and sensitive parts such as knuckles, forearms, the bridge of the nose, shins, stomach, solar plexus, spine, temple, ribs, groin, neck and eyes. The Kubotan is usually held in either an icepick grip (for hammerfist strikes) or forward grip (for stabbing, pressure point attacks and seizing). Common uses include hardening the fist (fistload) for punching, attacking vulnerable parts of an assailant's body, and gaining leverage on an assailant's wrist, fingers and joints. With keys attached, it can function as a flailing weapon. As a pressure point weapon it can attack any point a finger can, but with greater penetration because of the smaller surface area at the ends. For example, a law enforcement officer may wrap his arm around a suspect's neck while simultaneously digging the end of the Kubotan into the small of his back. The officer may also reach around the suspect's neck and underarm from behind and cause pain by stabbing the end of the Kubotan into the top of his pectoral muscle. In other locking and compliance applications, the body of the Kubotan can be used to create pain. A typical pain compliance technique involves seizing an attacker's wrist and sealing both hands around it with the length of the Kubotan laid across the radius bone. Downward squeezing pressure is then applied to the bone to take down the attacker. Legality The Kubotan may appear as an innocuous key fob to the untrained eye. In some cases however it may be recognized and considered an offensive weapon in some jurisdictions. In the United States there are few legal restrictions on Kubotans, with the notable exception that they are prohibited as carry-on items for air travellers. Whether a non-spiked Kubotan (i.e. a rod) is classed as an offensive weapon in the UK depends upon the circumstances of the case and is for a jury to decide.http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/1997/221.html In April 2010 actor and entertainer Darren Day was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon, namely a kubotan-style keyring, by a court in Edinburgh. Improvised versions of the Kubotan can be readily found and put to use. Because a Kubotan is just a rod of a hard material, any restrictive regulation would most likely be ambiguous and undefined due to the ability for any common item to be used in a kubotan-like fashion. In this respect, the Kubotan can be substituted by everyday items such as hairbrushes, pens, markers, flashlights, small wooden dowels and even electronic cigarettes. Metal pens (i.e. tactical pens) are also sometimes marketed as substitutes for the Kubotan. Trademark A generic Self-Defence Keychain Stick (SDKS) with tapered end Over time the registered name \\"Kubotan\\" has been eroded and genericized to include many knockoffs and imitations of the original design. Some incorporate spikes, tapered ends, and other modifications that were not part of the original invention. \\"Ninja\\" keychain weapons often enhanced with blades, hidden darts, and tear gas have also been marketed and sold as Kubotans, though they are copycats and are more properly classified along lines of generic self-defense keychain sticks (SDKS) or generic self-defense pocket weapons. The term 'pocket stick' is also sometimes used to classify such hand weapons.  Books  * Takayuki Kubota & John G.

Population: The district extends from Kitai-gorod northwest to Belorussky and Savyolovsky Rail Terminals . Its southern boundary runs one or two city blocks south from Tverskaya Street; eastern boundary follows the track of the Neglinnaya River now flowing in a tunnel under Samotechnaya Street, Tsvetnoy Boulevard, and Neglinnaya Street. Tverskoy District houses State Duma, Federation Council, the Mayor of Moscow, Moscow City Council, and Moscow Police Headquarters. It contains Theatre Square, the business district of Tverskaya Street with Pushkin Square, Petrovka Street, Dmitrovka Street, and the western part of Kuznetsky Most. It has the highest concentration of theatres, including Bolshoi Theatre and the historical Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions. Historical areas of Patriarshy Ponds, Malaya Bronnaya Street, and most of Tverskoy Boulevard, while closely associated with Tverskaya Street actually belong to Presnensky District. Since 2002 Tverskoy District also includes Kitai-gorod, which was once a separate territory managed directly by Central Administrative Okrug. History This section is based on P. V. Sytin's \\"History of Moscow Streets\\"Russian: П.В.Сытин, \\"Из истории московских улиц\\", М, 1948 (Sytin) Old Muscovy to 19th century St. Peter's Cathedral, Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, ca. 1508 Tverskaya Street emerged, as the road to Tver, in the 12th century. Dmitrovka Street, the road to Dmitrov, and Petrovka Street, leading to Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, date back to the 14th century. Church of Nativity in Putinki, 1650s Until the 1820s, the territory of what is now Tverskoy District was separated from the Moscow Kremlin by the Neglinnaya River. Because of that, the city grew primarily eastward in the Middle Ages—into the Red Square and Kitai- Gorod—while the development of western territories lagged behind. A stone bridge connecting Tverskaya with the Red Square was built in 1595. Urban development in the western part concentrated along Tverskaya Street. In the late 15th century, it was built out with country-like wooden homes to Pushkin Square, and by the end of the 16th century the city extended beyond the present-day Garden Ring. First stone Boyar houses appeared in downtown Tverskaya around that time. In 1654, Strastnoy Monastery was set up in present-day Pushkin Square, and three years later, Odoyevsky family set up a stone mansion on the site of present-day Museum of Modern History (formerly Museum of Revolution), beyond the Bely Gorod walls. Dmitrovka Street Dmitrovka Street also developed rapidly after the fire of 1648, as marked by the one-of- a-kind eight-tented church of Nativity in Putinki. Unusually for Moscow outskirts, it was financed by the State, as the church was located near the Embassy Inn (), home to foreign guests.Sytin, p.190 Dmitrovka Street Peter the Great's move of the national capital to Saint Petersburg actually improved the leading role of Tverskaya Street, as it became the main road of royal journeys between two capitals. Tverskaya acquired Moscow's first triumphal arch (1703, giving name to Triumphalnaya Square), Gagarin family palace (1760s), and Zakhar Chernyshyov mansion (1782); later the seat of Moscow Governor, Mossovet, and currently of the Mayor of Moscow (which was rebuilt in the 1940s). The Fire of 1812 wiped out wealthy mansions and peasant homes alike, sparing only the Pushkin Square;Sytin, p.128 Tverskaya was rebuilt as an upper-class street and retained this status ever since. Northeastern side of Tverskoy District (east of Petrovka Street) lagged behind Tverskaya Street and Moscow's east side due to frequent floods on the Neglinnaya River. First attempt to control the river, proposed in 1775 by Matvey Kazakov, materialized in 1792 Neglinnaya Canal, which was running parallel to the river. Once the canal was completed, the old river bed was filled with earth. In 1817–1819, the channel was covered with masonry vaults, locking the stream in a tunnel. This created Neglinnaya Street, the youngest street inside Boulevard Ring, but did not rule out future floods. The most recent flood, in 1973, led to complete rebuilding of the aging tunnel (1974–1989, see 1965 flood photos)Russian, Contractor report: Река Неглинная. История и современность, Мосинжроект, 2005 www.mosinzhproekt.ru Another legacy of the Neglinnaya river survives in Central Baths (1890) and Sandunovsky Baths (1896).Russian: \\"Москва начала века\\", М, ООО \\"O-Мастер\\", 2001 стр.184 (Builders of Moscow, p.184). Dates are for extant buildings. Sandunov family owned the baths since the 18th century.Sandunovsky Baths on Neglinnays Street are actually located in Meshchansky District (on the eastern side of the street), just like the Central Bank of Russian Federation building. =Theatre District= Theatre Square, Teatralnaya metro station The first public theater, Petrovsky Teatr, was set up in 1780 by English entrepreneur Michael Maddox and Prince Urusov in present-day Theatre Square. It burned down in October 1805 after 425 successful shows.German: http://russlandonline.ru In 1825, Joseph Bove built a new, larger Bolshoi Theatre on the same site. By this time, downtown stretch of the Neglinnaya River was contained in a tunnel; Peter's bastions of Kitai- gorod were razed, forming the Theatre Square. In the same 1825, landowner Vargin built Maly Theatre on his own adjacent lot. For the first five years, the State leased the building from Vargin; he was later convicted of fraud and the State bought out the building in 1832.Builders of Moscow, p.184 Owners of the opposite land lots were obliged to build houses exactly like Maly Theatre, forming a perfectly symmetrical neoclassical square with a parade ground and water fountain. The symmetry was eventually ruined by expansions in the 1870s, which added the third theatre—originally Bronnikov private theater (now Molodyozhny Theater). Another historical hall, the Assembly of Nobility (now the House of the Unions) stands on the corner of Bolshaya Dmitrovka and Okhotny Ryad streets since 1790. The building, designed by Matvey Kazakov, was rebuilt externally, but the Pillar Hall inside it, famous for its acoustics, remains close to Kazakov's original design. When the State lifted the ban on private theatres in 1882, tradition continued with Moscow Art Theatre in Kamergersky Lane (1902–1909),Builders of Russia, p.187 says \\"minor construction work proceeded till 1909\\". Substantial completion is usually dated 1903 Yermolova Theatre (1925), Hermitage (1883), and Aquarium (1898) park theatres, etc. Currently, Tverskoy District has nineteen repertory theatres, the Pillar Hall, Tchaikovsky Hall (1940), and Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard (originally Salamonovsky Circus, 1880, rebuilt in 1987–1989). =Industrial expansion= Nikolay Krotov, designed and managed by Alexander Zelenko and Stanislav Shatsky Unlike Presnensky or Basmanny Districts, Tverskoy has, and always had, very few industrial properties. However, its northern part, beyond Garden Ring, developed into a working-class neighborhood in line with the 19th-century industrialization. Development began in the 18th century with the Butyrka prison (rebuilt to a castle shape in 1800).Builders of Moscow, p.42 For the next hundred years, the territories around the prison were filled with farms and small wooden homes. Things changed with the construction of railroads—Smolensk railroad station was built in 1870; current building, known as Belorussky Rail Terminal, was completed in 1909. Savyolovsky Rail Terminal and Moscow Ring Railroad followed in the 1900s. Territories near the railroads were quickly used for factories, cheap housing for workers followed soon. Miusskaya Square, located three blocks from Belorussky Terminal, was a site of unusual urban development, a new center of blue-collar social life. In the course of one decade, 1904–1914, the city and private sponsors built Abrikosova Hospital and Nursery (1906),Builders of Moscow, p.329 Junior High School (1912),Builders of Moscow, p.372 Shanyavsky University (1913),Builders of Moscow, p.382 kindergartens, and trade schools. Development of similar social hubs in other working districts lagged behind and terminated with World War I and Russian Revolution of 1917. =Modern history= Manege Square: extant National Hotel and demolished Intourist Hotel (1970–2002) Redevelopment of Tverskaya Street began in the late 1920s with infill buildings like Ivan Rerberg's Central Telegraph (1927), and Grigory Barkhin's Izvestia building in Pushkin Square (1927). This was followed by demolition of Okhotny Ryad and Manege Square. Major reconstruction of Tverskaya Street began in 1937 with demolition of Strastnoy Monastery and dozens of smaller buildings. Three buildings, including Savvinskoye Podvorye, Mossovet building, and the Eye Clinic, were spared from demolition and moved to new foundations farther from the street. As a result, Savvinskoye Podvorye is now completely locked inside a 1930s stalinist block. Another building, a print shop at Pushkin Square, was moved in the 1970s to make way for Izvestia expansion.М.Трубилина, \\"Переезды во сне и наяву\\", Российская Газета, 1 марта 2004, www.rg.ru Design of the first stretch of new Gorky Street (the name of Tverskaya since 1935) was awarded to Arkady Mordvinov, 1929 graduate in architecture known for his ultra-left public statements. Mordvinov proved himself a good project manager, successfully testing so-called flow method of fast-track construction. By 1941, most of central Gorky Street was completed; the rest was built out after World War II. Contemporary Old Believers murals near Belorussky TerminalSt.Nicholas church of Rogozhskoye Old Believers was laid down shortly before World War I and was not properly completed and consecrated before the Revolution of 1917. All exterior and interior finished were made from scratch in the 1990s. In the 1970s, the street acquired Brezhnev-era boxlike buildings of 22-story Hotel Intourist (1970, demolished in 2002Russian: illustrated contractor's report on demolition www.krealist.ru) and smaller Minsk Hotel (1964, demolished in 2005) and New Izvestia building; less controversial pseudo-stalinist infill buildings followed in the 1980s and late 1990s. However, outside Tverskaya, historical buildings and neighborhoods were being demolished throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Many blocks in the Novoslobodskaya station area are already rebuilt as post-2000 highrises. The City has declared plans to reconstruct Pushkin Square and Belorussky Terminal Square with multi-level tunnels, shopping space, and parking,English: Pushkin Square Under Threat, The Moscow Times, 24.10.2006 MAPS but those plans were later abolished with mayor resignation. Population of Tverskoy District is traditionally affluent and educated, with a substantial share of foreigners (most of them are not included in official population count). Its ethnic mix, changing rapidly since the 1980s, has high shares of Tatars, Armenians and Jews; once-strong Ukrainian community has dispersed.Russian: Ethnicity maps in: Вендина, Ольга (ред.)

The United Kingdom is Nepal's largest bilateral aid donor, and the World Bank and Asian Development Bank are the largest multilateral donors. Donors have been reported as losing confidence in Nepal as a result of political interference and corruption in poverty relief efforts as well as the country's apparently poor capacity to utilize aid. According to World Bank figures, official development assistance increased from US$8.2 million in 1960 to US$369 million in 2003 and then fell to US$177 million in 2004. According to Nepal's Ministry of Finance, total foreign aid committed in fiscal year (FY) 2003 was US$555 million, with 63.3 percent in grants and 36.7 percent in loans. In FY2004, total foreign aid committed was US$320 million, of which 37.7 percent was grants and 62.3 percent, loans. In June 2004, active World Bank credits totaled US$302 million, with the greatest portions allocated to the financial sector (US$91.5 million)and to energy and mining (US$75.6 million). By the end of 2012, the outstanding World Bank IDA loan totaled $ 1.48 billion. Background Nepal has been a recipient of foreign assistance since 1952 when it joined the Colombo Plan for Cooperative, Economic, and Social Development in Asia and the Pacific. The plan was established, under a slightly different name, by the Commonwealth of Nations in 1951. During the 1950s, many Nepalese received scholarships through the Colombo Plan to go to different countries for studies in technical and professional areas Also during that time, all other aid was in the form of grants. The bulk of assistance was directed toward developing agriculture, transportation infrastructure, and power generation. Other areas targeted for assistance were communications, industry, education, and health. India and the United States each were responsible for more than one-third of all grants. Both countries established aid missions to Nepal and directed aid to special projects. Other major donors during the 1950s were the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Britain, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand also were involved in lesser assistance programs. The United Nations (UN) provided some technical assistance. Until the mid-1960s, Nepal depended mostly, if not totally, on foreign grants for all its development projects. Most of these grants were on a bilateral basis. Japan has been the largest donor country to Nepal. The single pillar bridge in Karnali, New Buspark, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), Melamchi drinking water project, few hydro-power projects and highways like B.P. Koirala Highway and the Koteshwor-Suryabinayak extended road (12 km) were built with assistance from Japan. Grants from India helped to build the airport in Kathmandu, the Koshi Dam, Bir Hospital, Trauma Center, highways like Tribhuvan Highway, Siddhartha Highway and several irrigation projects. The Soviet Union helped to build cigarette and sugar factories, a hydroelectric plant, and part of the East-West Highway (Nepal). Grants from China helped to construct roads; a trolley bus line in Kathmandu; BICC, Rastriya Sabha Griha, Civil Hospital in New Baneshwor, Bharatpur Cancer Hospital in Chitwan and leather, shoe, brick and tile factories. United States grants supported village development, agriculture, education, and public health. The United States also helped to build the Balaju Industrial Area and start the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation, which granted loans to several industries. Beginning in the 1960s, some bilateral assistance was in the form of loans. The loan share of foreign aid increased from under 4 percent between 1965 and 1970 to more than 25 percent by the 1985-88 period. In the 1970s, multilateral assistance programs started to play an important role in development planning and accounted for more than 70 percent of funding for development planning. By the end of the 1980s, the great majority of foreign aid was in the form of multilateral assistance programs. The major sources of borrowing or grants for these programs were the International Development Association of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Most of these loans could be characterized as soft loans. Sources of foreign aid were numerous. Eleven UN agencies, seven multilateral lending agencies (such as the World Bank), and eight private agencies (for example, the Ford Foundation) had participated in aid programs. At least seventeen countries offered bilateral assistance. Under the auspices of World Bank, the Nepal Aid Group was created in 1976. By 1987 sixteen countries and six international agencies participated in the group. The level of commitment from the Nepal Aid Group had increased from Rs1.5 billion in 1976-77 to Rs5.6 billion in 1987-88. The bulk of foreign aid contributions after 1976 came from this group. Most economic development projects were funded with external assistance on concessional terms. In the mid- to late 1980s, recorded aid disbursements averaged more than US$200 million annually--about 7 percent of GDP. More than 70 percent of the aid was in the form of grants; the remainder was in the form of concessional loans. A high percentage of technical assistance and direct aid payments were not documented. Much of the aid granted was underused. By 1991, Nepal was receiving external assistance in the form of project aid, commodity aid, technical assistance, and program aid. Project aid funded irrigation programs, hydroelectric plants, and roads. Commodity assistance targets included fertilizers, improved seeds, and construction materials provided by donor aid agencies. Technical assistance covered services of experts to advise the government in training indigenous personnel to perform research in technological fields and resulted in the development of skilled labor. Program aid supported various projects, in particular the agricultural and health fields. Dependence on foreign aid was increasing. Between 1984 and 1987, foreign aid as a percentage of GNP increased from under 8 percent to almost 13 percent. Debt service as a percentage of GDP increased from less than 0.1 percent in 1974-75 to almost 1 percent in 1987-88. Outstanding debt in this period increased from Rs346 million to almost Rs21 billion. From FY 1970 through FY 1988, United States commitments, including United States Export-Import Bank funds, totaled US$285 million. In the 1980s, bilateral United States economic assistance channelled through the Agency for International Development averaged US$15 million annually. The United States also contributed to various international institutions and private voluntary organizations that serviced Nepal for a total contribution to multilateral aid in excess of US$250 million in the 1980s. Other Western countries and official development assistance and bilateral commitments for the 1980-87 period totaled US$1.8 billion. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) provided US$30 million in bilateral aid from 1979 to 1989. Communist countries provided US$273 million in aid from 1970 to 1988. From 1981 until 1988, Japan was the premier source of bilateral ODA for Nepal, accounting for more than one-third of all funds. The second biggest donor during that period was the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). Alternatives There is an increasing number of social entrepreneurs who try to address development issues through individual, financially sustainable and more home-grown initiatives. With the first Social Entrepreneurship Award 2011 (and again in 2012) there is a small but steady movement and ecosystem building around those changemakers. One organization - Hidden Journeys Nepal - is trying to promote those social entrepreneurs and at them same time help others to learn from them through field visits and networking events that help participants to be motivated and inspired.

His red hair, fiery temperament and vehement disputes with other Boer leaders earned him the moniker \\"Stormvogel den Noorden,\\" \\"Storm bird of the North.\\" Early life The first member of the Schoeman clan arrived in the Cape in 1724 from Ditmarschen in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Ditmarschen had been a Boer Republic (Burenrepublik) of Merchant-farmers until 1550, and the memory of this free Boer Republic must have lived on in her sons who emigrated to South Africa. He originally settled in the Zoutpansberg but also owned a farm in Pretoria - the area now occupied by the Pretoria Zoo. Bloedstraat was also part of his farm. Stephanus Schoeman was a minor Trekker leader, who had his own flag. He joined Andries Pretorius' group, fighting in the Battle of Blood River. One of the three cannons used in the battle, Ou Grietjie belonged to Schoeman and is now on display in the Voortrekker Monument. Presidency As Commandant-General, Stephanus Schoeman was involved in a major political conflict with Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, the ZAR's First President and writer of its constitution. Schoeman rejected the constitution. Amongst others, Schoeman was supported by Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg whom he subsequently appointed as a provisional commandant. Van Rensburg represented Schoeman in negotiations with Pretorius's faction. In 1858, when Schoeman fell ill, Van Rensburg was appointed as acting Commandant-General. Shortly before the end of 1859, MW Pretorius, who was the son of the popular Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, was concurrently elected president of the Orange Free State (OFS). The Volksraad granted him six months leave to take up his office in the OFS during which he would negotiate the unification of the two Boer Republics. However, once his leave expired, the Volksraad would not allow Pretorius to resume his former office of president of the ZAR, as well as that of the OFS. Initially, Johannes Hermanus Grobler was appointed as acting President in Pretorius' absence, but Commandant-General Stephanus Schoeman refused to accept Grobler as acting president.http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/places/villages/gauteng/pretoria/index.php?id=3&page;=1 SA History Online, Pretoria, Period of Civil War. Schoeman instead believed that the presidency should have been granted to him as the constitution at the time stipulated that in cases of the president's dismissal or death, the presidency should be granted to the oldest member of the Executive Council. Being three years older than Grobler, the presidency should thus have been granted to Schoeman. Schoeman, supported by many dissatisfied burghers, relieved Grobler of his office, assuming it himself. In 1861, the Volksraad decided to take action against Schoeman, who with his followers steadfastly refused to give up his position, Paul Kruger intervened against Schoeman, however, no one was prepared to take extreme action, and bitter letters were exchanged between Schoeman and Kruger. It was only in 1862, when the Volksraad declared the Schoeman factions to be rebels, that Kruger could summon his burghers to the conflict. Kruger, who was elected commandant-general in April 1863, succeeded in driving Schoeman over the Vaal River. Schoeman's faction then tried to restore their position by force of arms. Commandant Jan Viljoen led a so-called 'People's army' against Kruger and his 'State Army' in January 1864, but was defeated at the Crocodile River. Peace was restored when a new election was held in 1864. Pretorius became president for a second time and Kruger retained his position as commander-in-chief. Retirement and death Heroes' Acre, Pretoria Pretorius resigned as president and retired in 1871 after a spectacular failure to prevent the Keate award which lopped off a large piece of the western Transvaal to satisfy a claim by the Barolong tribe. He died in Pretoria in 1890, aged 80. In 1904, both executors of his estate had died and the Master of the Supreme Court had to publicly advertise for anyone willing to finally settle what remained of his estate. Family and ancestors Schoeman married three times, finally marrying the widow Elsie Maria Aletta (née van Heerden) of the political figure state-head Pieter Johannes Potgieter, arch-antagonist of Andries Pretorius. Elsie Maria Aletta had children with both political leaders in their marriages and started a family famous for political and society influence. Her daughter Elsie Maria Aletta Potgieter was the mother of the famous doctor, successful businessman, Broederbond leader and Member of Parliament Dr. Pieter Johannes Potgieter Stofberg, whose father Ds. Jan Hendrik Malan Stofberg was Secretary and Head of NG churches in South-Africa. Schoeman's son with his second wife Gertina Johanna Schutte, General Hendrik Jacobus Schoeman, went on to fight in the Anglo-Boer War of 1899 – 1902. One of his daughters with Schutte, Catharina Christina Susanna Schoeman, married the Boer general, Johannes Hermanus Michiel Kock. His grandson, Dr. Gustav Preller became not only a leading historian but a renowned \\"Taalstryder,\\" or champion of the Afrikaans language, while one of his sons, Johan Schoeman achieved renown as a publisher of anti- Communist materials. A great-grandson, Hendrik Schoeman was the Minister of Transport for decades. Minister Schoeman was also a cousin of Dr. Pieter Johannes Potgieter Stofberg. Legacy The street in Pretoria, Schoemanstraat is named after him, as is the town, Schoemansdal, which was razed by the Venda in the 1860s. (The ruins are currently being excavated again.)

The map is at the top and atomic model of the DNA colored below. (Deposited in EMDB EMD-2210) DNA origami is the nanoscale folding of DNA to create non-arbitrary two- and three-dimensional shapes at the nanoscale. The specificity of the interactions between complementary base pairs make DNA a useful construction material, through design of its base sequences. DNA is a well-understood material that is suitable for creating scaffolds that hold other molecules in place or to create structures all on its own. DNA origami was the cover story of Nature on March 16, 2006.Nature, Volume 440 (7082) March 16, 2006 Since then, DNA origami has progressed past an art form and has found a number of applications from drug delivery systems to uses as circuitry in plasmonic devices; however, most applications remain in a concept or testing phase.  Overview  The idea of using DNA as a construction material was first introduced in the early 1980s by Nadrian Seeman. The current method of DNA origami was developed by Paul Rothemund at the California Institute of Technology. The process involves the folding of a long single strand of viral DNA (typically the 7,249 bp genomic DNA of M13 bacteriophage) aided by multiple smaller \\"staple\\" strands. These shorter strands bind the longer in various places, resulting in the formation of a pre-defined two- or three- dimensional shape. Examples include a smiley face and a coarse map of China and the Americas, along with many three-dimensional structures such as cubes. To produce a desired shape, images are drawn with a raster fill of a single long DNA molecule. This design is then fed into a computer program that calculates the placement of individual staple strands. Each staple binds to a specific region of the DNA template, and thus due to Watson-Crick base pairing, the necessary sequences of all staple strands are known and displayed. The DNA is mixed, then heated and cooled. As the DNA cools, the various staples pull the long strand into the desired shape. Designs are directly observable via several methods, including electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, or fluorescence microscopy when DNA is coupled to fluorescent materials. Bottom-up self-assembly methods are considered promising alternatives that offer cheap, parallel synthesis of nanostructures under relatively mild conditions. Since the creation of this method, software was developed to assist the process using CAD software. This allows researchers to use a computer to determine the way to create the correct staples needed to form a certain shape. One such software called caDNAno is an open source software for creating such structures from DNA. The use of software has not only increased the ease of the process but has also drastically reduced the errors made by manual calculations.  Applications  Many potential applications have been suggested in literature, including enzyme immobilization, drug delivery systems, and nanotechnological self- assembly of materials. Though DNA is not the natural choice for building active structures for nanorobotic applications, due to its lack of structural and catalytic versatility, several papers have examined the possibility of molecular walkers on origami and switches for algorithmic computing.DNA 'organises itself' on silicon,BBC News, August 17, 2009 The following paragraphs list some of the reported applications conducted in the laboratories with clinical potential. Researchers at the Harvard University Wyss Institute reported the self-assembling and self-destructing drug delivery vessels using the DNA origami in the lab tests. The DNA nanorobot they created is an open DNA tube with a hinge on one side which can be clasped shut. The drug filled DNA tube is held shut by a DNA aptamer, configured to identify and seek certain diseased related protein. Once the origami nanobots get to the infected cells, the aptamers break apart and release the drug. The first disease model the researchers used was leukemia and lymphoma. Researchers in the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology in Beijing and Arizona State University reported a DNA origami delivery vehicle for Doxorubicin, a well-known anti-cancer drug. The drug was non-covalently attached to DNA origami nanostructures through intercalation and a high drug load was achieved. The DNA-Doxorubicin complex was taken up by human breast adenocarcinoma cancer cells (MCF-7) via cellular internalization with much higher efficiency than doxorubicin in free form. The enhancement of cell killing activity was observed not only in regular MCF-7, more importantly, also in doxorubicin-resistant cells. The scientists theorized that the doxorubicin-loaded DNA origami inhibits lysosomal acidification, resulting in cellular redistribution of the drug to action sites, thus increasing the cytotoxicity against the tumor cells. In a study conducted by a group of scientists from iNANO center and CDNA Center at Aarhus university, researchers were able to construct a small multi-switchable 3D DNA Box Origami. The proposed nanoparticle was characterized by AFM, TEM and FRET. The constructed box was shown to have a unique reclosing mechanism, which enabled it to repeatedly open and close in response to a unique set of DNA or RNA keys. The authors proposed that this \\"DNA device can potentially be used for a broad range of applications such as controlling the function of single molecules, controlled drug delivery, and molecular computing.\\". Nanorobots made of DNA origami demonstrated computing capacities and completed pre-programmed task inside the living organism was reported by a team of bioengineers at Wyss Institute at Harvard University and Institute of Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials at Bar-Ilan University. As a proof of concept, the team injected various kinds of nanobots (the curled DNA encasing molecules with fluorescent markers) into live cockroaches. By tracking the markers inside the cockroaches, the team found the accuracy of delivery of the molecules (released by the uncurled DNA) in target cells, the interactions among the nanobots and the control are equivalent to a computer system. The complexity of the logic operations, the decisions and actions, increases with the increased number of nanobots. The team estimated that the computing power in the cockroach can be scaled up to that of an 8-bit computer. DNA is folded into an octahedron and coated with a single bilayer of phospholipid, mimicking the envelope of a virus particle. The DNA nanoparticles, each at about the size of a virion, are able to remain in circulation for hours after injected into mice. It also elicits much lower immune response than the uncoated particles. It presents a potential use in drug delivery, reported by researchers in Wyss Institute at Harvard University. Similar approaches The idea of using protein design to accomplish the same goals as DNA origami has surfaced as well. Researchers at the National Institute of Chemistry in Slovenia are working on using rational design of protein folding to create structures much like those seen with DNA origami. The main focus of current research in protein folding design is in the drug delivery field, using antibodies attached to proteins as a way to create a targeted vehicle.

For criminal suspects, extradition is the most common type of rendition. Rendition can also be seen as the act of handing over, after the request for extradition has taken place. Rendition can also mean the act of rendering, i.e. delivering, a judicial decision, or of explaining a series of events, as a defendant or witness. It can also mean the execution of a judicial order by the directed parties. But extraordinary rendition is distinct from both deportation and extradition, being inherently illegal.  United States = Interstate rendition  Rendition between states is required by Article Four, Section Two of the United States Constitution; this section is often termed the rendition clause. Each state has a presumptive duty to render suspects on the request of another state, as under the full faith and credit clause. The Supreme Court has established certain exceptions; a state may allow its own legal proceedings against a suspect to take precedence, for example. It was established in Kentucky v. DennisonKentucky v. Dennison 65 U.S. 66 (1860) that interstate rendition and extradition were not a federal writ; that is, a state could not petition the federal courts to have another state honor its request for rendition, if the state receiving the request chose not to do so. If the State failed to request federal intervention, but relied on other argument for the rendition, the Hatfield/McCoy feud produced the case of Mahon v. Justice,Mahon v. Justice – 127 U.S. 700 (1888) holding there is \\"no comity between the states by which a person held upon an indictment for a criminal offense in one state can be turned over to the authorities of another state, although abducted from the latter.\\" The Uniform Extradition Act may nullify this result in those States that have adopted it. In rare cases, usually involving the death penalty, states have refused or delayed rendition. In 1987, this was overturned by Puerto Rico v. Branstad,U.S. Supreme Court Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U.S. 219 (1987) so a federal interest in resolving interstate rendition disputes was established. Nevertheless, the right of refusal of rendition was not overturned. Extradition for fugitives who are charged with a crime is commonly requested by state or county prosecutors. Formal interstate rendition will involve both state governors. Other procedures can involve waiving documentary formalities before surrender of the fugitive. Under the Uniform Extradition Act adopted in 48 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (but not in Mississippi and South Carolina), there is a distinction between fugitives who were in the demanding state at the time of the crime and those nonfugitives whose prior presence is not so alleged. The first type is mandatory under the United States Constitution. The less frequent second type allows for some Gubernatorial discretion. These cases can involve bad checks or failure to pay child support but they still must be criminal matters. Bounty hunters and bondsmen once had unlimited authority to capture fugitives, even outside the state where they were wanted by the courts. When they deliver such a person, this is considered rendition, as it did not involve the intervention of the justice system in the state of capture. Under more recent law, bounty hunters are not legally permitted to act outside of the state where the offense took place, but cases of rendition still take place due to the financial interest the bondsmen have in returning a fugitive and recovering from the bail bond forfeiture. Formally, such fugitive cases should be turned over to the state for execution under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (1936) and the Uniform Extradition and Rendition Act (1980), if the fugitive's location is known, or the United States Marshals Service, when it is not. Before attempting to apprehend a bail fugitive in the State of California who has fled bail from another state, a bounty hunter or bail bondsman must adhere to the provisions set forth in California Penal Code Section 847.5. California Penal Code Section 847.5 Fugitive admitted to bail in another state; affidavit; hearing; warrant for arrest; order for return If a person has been admitted to bail in another state, escapes bail, and is present in this State, the bail bondsman or other person who is bail for such fugitive, may file with a magistrate in the county where the fugitive is present an affidavit stating the name and whereabouts of the fugitive, the offense with which the alleged fugitive was charged or of which he was convicted, the time and place of same, and the particulars in which the fugitive has violated the terms of his bail, and may request the issuance of a warrant for arrest of the fugitive, and the issuance, after hearing, of an order authorizing the affiant to return the fugitive to the jurisdiction from which he escaped bail. The magistrate may require such additional evidence under oath as he deems necessary to decide the issue. If he concludes that there is probable cause for believing that the person alleged to be a fugitive is such, he may issue a warrant for his arrest. The magistrate shall notify the district attorney of such action and shall direct him to investigate the case and determine the facts of the matter. When the fugitive is brought to him pursuant to the warrant, the magistrate shall set a time and place for hearing, and shall advise the fugitive of his right to counsel and to produce evidence at the hearing. He may admit the fugitive to bail pending the hearing. The district attorney shall appear at the hearing. If, after hearing, the magistrate is satisfied from the evidence that the person is a fugitive he may issue an order authorizing affiant to return the fugitive to the jurisdiction from which he escaped bail. A bondsman or other person who is bail for a fugitive admitted to bail in another state who takes the fugitive into custody, except pursuant to an order issued under this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Special provisions exist for sworn peace officers in regards to apprehending a fugitive in the State of California, who has fled from another state as outlined in California Penal Code Sections 1551 and 1551.1 California Penal Code Section 1551 Complaint against fugitive; magistrate's warrant; attaching certified copy of complaint and affidavit to warrant (a) Whenever any person within this State is charged by a verified complaint before any magistrate of this State with the commission of any crime in any other State, or, with having been convicted of a crime in that State and having escaped from confinement, or having violated the terms of his bail, probation or parole; or (b) whenever complaint is made before any magistrate in this State setting forth on the affidavit of any credible person in another State that a crime has been committed in such other State and that the accused has been charged in such State with the commission of the crime, or that the accused has been convicted of a crime in that State and has escaped from bail, probation or parole and is believed to be in this State; then the magistrate shall issue a warrant directed to any peace officer commanding him to apprehend the person named therein, wherever he may be found in this State, and to bring him before the same or any other magistrate who is available in or convenient of access to the place where the arrest is made. A certified copy of the sworn charge or complaint and affidavit upon which the warrant is issued shall be attached to the warrant. California Penal Code Section 1551.1 Arrest without warrant; grounds; taking prisoner before magistrate; complaint The arrest of a person may also be lawfully made by any peace officer, without a warrant, upon reasonable information that the accused stands charged in the courts of any other state with a crime punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or that the person has been convicted of a crime punishable in the state of conviction by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and thereafter escaped from confinement or violated the terms of his or her bail, probation or parole. When so arrested the accused shall be taken before a magistrate with all practicable speed and complaint shall be made against him or her under oath setting forth the ground for the arrest as in Section 1551. Rendition was infamously used to recapture fugitive slaves, who under the Constitution and various federal laws had virtually no human rights. As the movement for abolition grew, Northern states increasingly refused to comply or cooperate with rendition of escaped slaves, leading to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. This non-cooperation was behind the longstanding principle of refusal, only reverted in the 1987 decision. Irregular rendition American use of “irregular rendition” is a familiar alternative to extradition, and it is the same process as extraordinary rendition. It involves kidnapping or deceit. In the view of the United States, kidnapping a defendant overseas and returning him to the United States for trial does not remove jurisdiction from American courts unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result.CRS Report for Congress.

Although Julian had the necessary extradition papers, he found that there was no official to meet his request due to the recent Chilean military occupation of Lima. Rather than return home empty-handed, Julian kidnapped the fugitive, with assistance from Chilean forces, and placed him on a U.S. vessel heading back to the United States.http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1182&context;=jleg * Shirley Collins, 1952 Shirley Collins was abducted from a bus station in Chicago, Illinois due to being a suspect in a murder case in Michigan. The authorities from Michigan went to Illinois and forcibly abducted the defendant to take him back to Michigan to get tried for the murder. He claimed that he was forcibly seized, handcuffed and blackjacked (being hit by a short leather club) by the Chicago authorities. Upon being taken to the Chicago police department he was denied counsel and blackjacked again when he refused to return to Michigan to be tried, this time it was by the Michigan and Chicago authorities. * Francisco Toscanino, 1974 Francisco Toscanino was forcibly abducted from Italy and taken back to the US, due to being accused of intent to smuggle narcotics into the United States. Uruguayan police forcibly abducted the Italian and gave him to the American authorities. * Julio Juventino Lujan, 1975 In Lujan, the defendant was abducted in a foreign country and brought to the United States to face prosecution for a narcotics violation. Lujan attacked the court's jurisdiction over his person based upon the manner in which he was apprehended. * Dan Davis (writer), 2007 Davis was a fugitive from the United States for more than 10 years when he was kidnapped in Venezuela by paramilitary forces and turned over to the United States Homeland Security at the airport and flown to Miami and turned over to the US Marshals Service for sentencing from his original drug charges.Davis, Dan “Tito” and Conti, Peter.

Extraordinary rendition  Human rights groups charge that extraordinary rendition is a violation of Article 3UNCAT Article 3 \\"1. No State Party shall expel, return (\\"refouler\\") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. 2. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.\\" of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT), because suspects are taken to countries where torture during interrogation remains common, thus circumventing the protections the captives would enjoy in the United States or nations who abide by the terms of UNCAT. Its legality remains highly controversial, as the United States outlaws the use of torture, and the U.S. Constitution guarantees due process. Rendered suspects are denied due process because they are arrested without charges, deprived of legal counsel, and illegally transferred to a third world country with the intent and purpose of facilitating torture and other interrogation measures which would be illegal in the USA. Other uses Two \\"reform school\\" groups, the Aspen Education Group and WWASP, have been accused of using a contractor to kidnap teenagers from their homes or in public, to transport them to facilities around the world. Many of the youth who spent time in these schools have spoken of being abducted during the night, while outside with friends, and (in one case) staying at their boyfriend's house. The most famous of these companies is called Strawn Support Services and has agents working in every state of the US as well as in Latin American countries where WWASP schools are located. These agents often carry weapons such as tasers, mace, and occasionally firearms during transports.

Early life and career  Ginzburg was born in Odessa to a Jewish family, and moved with them, first to Berlin and later to Turin at a very young age. He studied at the Liceo Ginnasio Massimo d'Azeglio in Turin.Ward, David. \\"Primo Levi's Turin.\\" In: Gordon, Robert S.C. (editor).

This school molded a group of intellectuals and political activists who would fight Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime and, eventually, help create the post-war democratic Italy. His classmates included such notable intellectuals as Norberto Bobbio, Piero Gobetti, Cesare Pavese, Giulio Einaudi, Massimo Mila, Vittorio Foa, Giancarlo Pajetta and Felice Balbo. In the early 1930s, Ginzburg taught Slavic Languages and Russian Literature at the University of Turin, and was credited with helping to introduce Russian authors to the Italian public. In 1933, Ginzburg co-founded, with Giulio Einaudi, the publishing house Einaudi. He lost his teaching position in 1934, having refused to swear an oath of allegiance imposed by the Fascist regime.

He was arrested again in 1935 for his activities as leader (with Carlo Levi) of the Italian branch of Giustizia e Libertà,Giustizia e libertà at www.pbmstoria.it the Justice and Freedom Party, which Carlo Rosselli had founded in Paris in 1929. In 1938 he married Natalia Ginzburg (née Levi). The same year he lost his Italian citizenship when the Fascist regime introduced antisemitic racial laws. In 1940, the Ginzburgs received the fascist punishment known as confino, or internal exile, to a remote, impoverished village, in their case Pizzoli in the Abruzzi, where they stayed from 1940-1943.Biography of Natalia Ginzburg , Rai International (accessed October 30, 2010) Somehow, Leone was able to continue his work as head of the Einaudi publishing house throughout the period. In 1942, he co- founded the clandestine Partito d'AzionePartito d'azione (1942-1947) at www.pbmstoria.it or \\"Action Party\\", a party of the democratic resistance. He also edited their newspaper L'Italia Libera.  Capture and murder  In 1943, after the Allied invasion of Sicily and the fall of Mussolini, Leone went to Rome, leaving his family in the Abruzzi. When Nazi Germany invaded in September, Natalia Ginzburg and their three children fled Pizzoli, simply climbing aboard a German truck and telling the driver that they were war refugees who had lost their papers. They met with Leone and went into hiding in the capital. On 20 November 1943, Leone – who now used the false name Leonida Gianturco – was arrested by the Italian police in a clandestine printshop of the newspaper L'Italia Libera. He was taken to the German section of the Regina Coeli prison. They subjected him to severe torture. On 5 February 1944 he died there from the injuries he received; he was 34 years old.Opposition to Fascism , Memorial Library, University of Wisconsin-Madison  Notes  References  * Natalia Ginzburg, All Our Yesterdays * Natalia Ginzburg, The Things We Used To Say * Susan Zuccotti, The Italians and the Holocaust: Persecution, Rescue, and Survival, University of Nebraska Press  External links  * Books of the Times; Richard Bernstein, \\"Telling the Bigger Story With the Small Details\\", The New York Times, August 4, 1999 Category:1909 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Odessa Jews Category:People from Kherson Governorate Category:Italian journalists Category:Italian male journalists Category:Italian anti-fascists Category:Members of Giustizia e Libertà Category:Resistance members killed by Nazi Germany Category:Jewish anti-fascists Category:Jewish Italian politicians Category:Imperial Russian Jews Category:Action Party (Italy) politicians Category:20th-century Italian politicians Category:People executed by torture Category:Jewish resistance members during the Holocaust Category:Jews executed by Nazi Germany Category:Italian people executed by Nazi Germany Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Italy Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Germany Category:20th-century journalists Category:Writers from Turin ","title":"Leone Ginzburg"},{"id":"4415708","text":"Flag of Grenada The Official Logo of the Grenada Commonwealth Games Association Grenada participated in the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.

Lock Up was joined by Peter Tägtgren (Hypocrisy) for its debut album, 1999's Pleasures Pave Sewers, and Tomas Lindberg (At the Gates, Disfear) for 2002's Hate Breeds Suffering and a Japanese tour. The band was later joined by guitarist Anton Reisenegger (Pentagram Chile and Criminal) in place of the late Pintado. Lock Up have played very few live shows. In 2009, the band announced that they would play the Damnation Festival that year. The line-up featured Embury, Barker, Lindberg and Reisenegger. It was touted as the band's last ever live show; however, they later booked more shows for 2010 and 2012. During February of that year, they scheduled a ten show mini-tour in the United States. It was their first time playing in that country. Shane Embury was unable to make the shows so Danny Lilker from Nuclear Assault filled in on bass for the duration of the trek. On 3 December 2010, Lock Up uploaded the first new piece of music in eight years, a track titled \\"Life of Devastation\\", to the band's official MySpace page. The song is set to appear on a split seven-inch single with Misery Index in 2011. The band's third studio album, Necropolis Transparent, was recorded in November and December 2010 at HVR Studios in Ipswich, England, and features guest appearances by Peter Tägtgren and Jeff Walker (Carcass, Brujeria). It was released on 1 July in Europe and 12 July in North America by Nuclear Blast Records. The fourth album, Demonization, was released in March 2017 through Listenable Records.

He was installed as Nawab with the support of the British East India Company, replacing Mir Jafar, his father-in-law, who had h Veni's Kitchen imself been supported earlier by the East India Company after his role in winning the Battle of Plassey for the British. However, Mir Jafar eventually ran into Veni's Kitchen disputes with the East India Company and attemptVeed to form an alliance with the Dutch East India Company instead. The British eventually defeated the Dutch at Chinsura and overthrew Mir Jafar, replacing him with Mir Qasim. Qasim later fell out with the British and fought against them at Buxar. His defeat has been suggested as a key reason in the British becoming the dominant power in large parts of North and East India.  Life  The Nawab's arrival before Clive's position. Upon ascending the throne, Mir Qasim repaid the East India Company with lavish gifts, as thanks for their support in his ascension to the throne. However, Qasim soon ran into disputes with the Company over trade issues, as they objected to Qasim's attempt to levy import and export tariffs on their goods. In particular, they objected to a 9% duty imposed of all foreign traders. The relationship between Qasim and the company slowly deteriorated, and he shifted his capital from Murshidabad to Munger in present-day Bihar where he raised an army, financing his new troops by streamlining tax collection. Qasim vigorously opposed the East India Company's position that their Mughal license (a dastak) meant that they could trade without paying taxes (other local merchants with dastaks were required to pay up to 40% of their revenue as tax). Frustrated at the British refusal to pay these taxes, Mir Qasim abolished taxes on the local traders as well. This upset the advantage that the European traders had been enjoying so far, and hostilities built up. Mir Qasim invaded the Company offices in Patna in 1763, killing several Europeans including the Resident. Mir Qasim allied with Shuja- ud-Daula of Avadh and Shah Alam II, the incumbent Mughal emperor against the British. However, their combined forces were defeated in the Battle of Buxar in 1764. Qasim also launched a brief invasion of Nepal in 1763 during the reign of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the first King of Nepal. Kanak Singh, a local Indian chief, had requested Qasim's intervention against Shah after he had taken Bikram Sen, the king of Makwanpur, hostage. Qasim dispatched a military force under the command of his general Gurgin Khan to invade Nepal. Khan was swiftly defeated by Shah's army, and retreated. Unlike Siraj-ud-Daulah before him, Mir Qasim was an effective and popular ruler. Their victory at Buxar established the East India Company as a powerful force in the province of Bengal in a much more real sense than at Plassey seven years earlier and at Bedara five years earlier. By 1793 the East India company hadabolished the Nizamat (referring to the Mughal suzerainty) and became completely in charge of the former Mughal province. Mir Qasim was defeated during the Battle of Murshidabad, Battle of Gherain and the Battle of Udhwa nala.  Death  Having lost all his men and influence after his defeat at Buxar, Qasim was expelled from his camp by Shuja-ud-Daula on 23 October 1764; fleeing to Rohilkhand, Allahabad, Gohad and Jodhpur, and eventually settling at Kotwal, near Delhi ca. 1774. Mir Qasim died in obscurity and abject poverty possibly from dropsy, at Kotwal, near Delhi on 8 May 1777. His two shawls, the only property left by him, had to be sold to pay for his funeral.

On 22 March 1943, almost the entire population of the village was massacred by the Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118 in retaliation for an attack on German troops by Soviet partisans. The battalion was composed of Nazi collaborators and assisted by the Dirlewanger Waffen-SS special battalion.Zur Geschichte der Ordnungspolizei 1936—1942, Teil II, Georg Tessin, Dies Satbe und Truppeneinheiten der Ordnungspolizei, Koblenz 1957, s.172-173Per A. Rudling, \\"Terror and Local Collaboration in Occupied Belorussia: The Case of Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118. Part One: Background\\", Historical Yearbook of the Nicolae Iorga History Institute (Bucharest) 8 (2011), p.202-203 Background The massacre was not an unusual incident in Belarus during World War II. At least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were burned and destroyed by the Nazis, and often all their inhabitants were killed (some amounting up to 1,500 victims) as a punishment for collaboration with partisans. In the Vitebsk region, 243 villages were burned down twice, 83 villages three times, and 22 villages were burned down four or more times. In the Minsk region, 92 villages were burned down twice, 40 villages three times, nine villages four times, and six villages five or more times. Altogether, over 2,000,000 people were killed in Belarus during the three years of Nazi occupation, almost a quarter of the region's population. Massacre On 22 March 1943, a German convoy was attacked by Soviet partisans near Koziri village just 6 km away from Khatyn, resulting in the deaths of four police officers of Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118. Among the dead was Hauptmann Hans Woellke, the battalion's commanding officer. Troops from the Dirlewanger Brigade, a unit mostly composed of criminals recruited for Nazi security warfare tasks, entered the village and drove the inhabitants from their houses and into a shed, which was then covered with straw and set on fire. The trapped people managed to break down the front doors, but in trying to escape, were killed by machine gun fire. 147 people, including 75 children under 16 years of age, were killed – burned, shot or suffocated in fire. The village was then looted and burned to the ground. Survivors Bell tower at the Khatyn Memorial. Eight inhabitants of the village survived, of whom six witnessed the massacre – five children and an adult. Two were still alive in 2008. # Twelve-year-old Anton Iosifovich Baranovsky (1930–1969) was left for dead with wounds in both legs. His injuries were treated by partisans. Five months after the opening of the Memorial, Baranovsky died in unclear circumstances. # The only adult survivor of the massacre, 56-year-old village smith Yuzif Kaminsky (1887–1973), recovered consciousness with wounds and burns after the killers had left. He supposedly found his burned son, who later died in his arms. This incident was later commemorated with a statue at the Khatyn Memorial. # Another 12-year-old boy, Alexander Petrovich Zhelobkovich (1930–1994), escaped from the village before the soldiers were able to fully surround it. His mother woke him up and put him on a horse, on which he escaped to a nearby village. After the war, he served in the armed forces and became a reserve lieutenant colonel. # Vladimir Antonovich Yaskevich (1930–2008) hid in a potato pit 200 meters from his family house. Two soldiers noticed the boy, but spared him. Vladimir noted that they spoke German between themselves, not Ukrainian. # Sofia Antonovna Yaskevich (later Fiokhina) (1934-2020), Vladimir's sister, hid in the cellar from the early morning of the massacre. As an adult she worked as a typist, and was last reported living in Minsk. # Viktor Andreevich Zhelobkovich (1934-2020), a seven-year-old boy, survived the fire in the shed under the corpse of his mother. As an adult, he worked at the design office of precise engineering, and was also reported to be living in Minsk. Two other Khatyn women survived because they were away from the village that day. * Tatyana Vasilyevna Karaban (1910 – c. 2000s) was visiting relatives in a neighboring village, Seredniaya. * Sofya Klimovich, a relative of Karaban, was also visiting a nearby village. After the war she worked at the Memorial for several years. Post-war trials The commander of one of the platoons of 118th Schutzmannschaft Battalion, former Soviet junior lieutenant Vasyl Meleshko, was tried in a Soviet court and executed in 1975. The chief of staff of 118th Schutzmannschaft Battalion, former Red Army senior lieutenant Hryhoriy Vasiura, was tried in Minsk in 1986 and found guilty of all his crimes. He was sentenced to death by the verdict of the military tribunal of the Belorussian Military District. The case and the trial of the main executioner of Khatyn was not given much publicity in the media; the leaders of the Soviet republics worried about the inviolability of unity between the Belarusian and Ukrainian peoples. Khatyn Memorial «Cemetery of villages» with 185 tombs. Each tomb symbolizes a particular village in Belarus which was burned together with its population. Khatyn became a symbol of mass killings of the civilian population during the fighting between partisans, German troops, and collaborators. In 1969, it was named the national war memorial of the Byelorussian SSR.https://m.eng.belta.by/video/getRecord/697/ Among the best-recognized symbols of the memorial complex is a monument with three birch trees, with an eternal flame instead of a fourth tree, a tribute to the one in every four Belarusians who died in the war. There is also a statue of Yuzif Kaminsky carrying his dying son, and a wall with niches to represent the victims of all the concentration camps, with large niches representing those with more than 20,000 victims. Bells ring every 30 seconds to commemorate the rate at which Belarusian lives were lost throughout the duration of the Second World War. Part of the memorial is a Cemetery of villages with 185 tombs. Each tomb symbolizes a particular village in Belarus that was torched along with its population. Among the foreign leaders who have visited the Khatyn Memorial during their time in office are Richard Nixon of the US, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Rajiv Gandhi of India, Yasser Arafat of the PLO, and Jiang Zemin of China. According to Norman Davies, the Khatyn massacre was deliberately exploited by the Soviet authorities to cover up the Katyn massacre, and this was a major reason for erecting the memorial—it was done in order to cause confusion with Katyn among foreign visitors. In 2004, the Memorial was renovated. According to 2011 data, the Memorial was in the top ten of the most attended tourist sites in Belarus – that year it was visited by 182,000 people.

Sergio De Camargo studied at the Academia Altamira in Buenos Aires under Emilio Pettoruti and Lucio Fontana. Camargo also studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris. On a protracted trip through Europe in 1948, Camargo met Brâncuși, Arp, Henri Laurens and Georges Vantongerloo. Sérgio de Camargo showed work at numerous international exhibitions, including the 1965 São Paulo Biennale (where he won a gold medal), the 1966 Venice Biennale, and the 1968 documenta in Kassel. Sérgio de Camargo died in Rio de Janeiro in 1990. The Tate Gallery in London has one of de Camargo's work in their permanent collection.  Early Life and Education  Sergio Camargo was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1933. Camargo began his art education at the Academia Altamira in Buenos Aires under Lucio Fontana and Emilio Pettoruti . He would later move to Paris in 1948, where he enrolled at the Academie de la Grand Chaumiere. He also studied at the Sorbonne, where he encountered the philosopher Gaston Bachelard. However, Camargo was most influenced by Constantin Brancusi’s study of the natural world through the lens of volumetric forms, which inspired his interest in the language of materials. When Carmargo returned home to Brazil in the 1950s, he stumbled into the rising Neo-Concrete Constructivist and Kinetic Op Art movements. Camargo found that the volumetric forms captured the immaterial qualities of being. Ultimately playing with light and form to express feelings of existence. In 1952-53 he again returned to Europe and went to China in 1954. Between 1961 and 1974 Sérgio de Camargo remained in Paris, where he became a member of the Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV) in 1963. During that period he concentrated on structuring monochrome white surfaces some in \\"Polyhedral Volumes of Mutable Readings\\" using parallelepiped shapes and others with cylindrical wooden reliefs, in both cases proposing the play of lights and shadows alternating between order and chaos, fullness and emptiness. As retold by Guy Brett, a curator and friend: “Cutting an apple to eat it, he sliced off nearly half and then made another cut at a different angle to take a piece out. The two planes made a simple relationship between light and shadow. Camargo grasped it; unconsciously, he had made the first cylindrical element. In the apple was the synthesis he had been working towards … the combination of a single element of substance (the rounded body of the apple) and direction (the plane he had just exposed). It is a synthesis of his thought and experience in a single sculptural sign” It was from cutting this apple that Camargo was able to see how the refractions of light acted differently based on circumstance. This simple act would become the catalyst for his first painted wood reliefs. The wood reliefs, monochromatic in nature allowed for simple and repetitive logic with only subtle alterations. With such slight variations arranged across an otherwise flat plane, there became thousands of compositional possibilities. These wood reliefs communicated a specific message of light and its surroundings. Gaston Bachelard would frame it, light and shadow ‘inhabit’ the work such that it can ‘transcend geometrical space’.  Breakthrough and Early Exhibitions  Carmargo received the International Sculpture Prize at the Paris Biennale in 1963. Camargo had continued success in Europe in 1964. His wood reliefs would win him his first solo exhibition at Signals Gallery in London. It is this gallery that would go on to host some of Camargo’s peers, such as Lygia Clark, Mira Schendel, and Helio Oiticica. It was these artists and exhibitions that would shed light on the growing Brazilian contemporary art world. In 1965, he found success in South America as well In 1965 Camargo would continue his success and recognition with his first solo museum exhibition at the Museu de Arte Modern do Rio de Janeiro. Additionally, he was named best national sculptor in the São Paulo Bienal. His employment of new materials is largely attributed to this success. With access to Carrara marble, Camargo began creating work of a much grander scale. Finally, Camargo could fully explore his ideas in a fully three-dimensional context. With this exploration of size and material, Camargo also decided to expand his library of geometric shapes to more prismatic elements that would pierce, project, and recede. His strongest examples can be seen in his commissions for the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux- Pellegrin, and the Palacio Itamaraty, Brasilia. Also in 1965, he began sculptural pieces for Oscar Niemeyer's Foreign Ministry Building in Brasília.Eventually, by 1967, he contributed a monumental element to the site—a rhythmically structured 25 meter wall. During the late 1960s Sérgio de Camargo showed work at numerous international exhibitions, including the 1965 São Paulo Biennale, the 1966 Venice Biennale, and the 1968 documenta in Kassel.  Return to Brazil  Carmargo decided it was time to leave Europe and subsequently returned to Brazil in 1973. While Carmargo had been gone Brazil had been in a time of prosperity with the rise in exportation of newly found oil repositories. Carmargo’s return to Brazil would bring about a new phase within his practice. It is the later works of Carmargo’s that seem to be defined by a return to previous forms and experiments. In 1977 he won the sculpture award given by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics. In the 1980s his works largely returned to the original cylindrical forms, as well as shrinking in scale. Perhaps most significantly there was less conflict been form and volume. During this time Carmargo also began working with yet another new material, Belgian black marble. The artist’s interest in this material stemmed from its inherent ability to absorb light. This facet of the marble allowed Carmargo to use reflection in the same manner in which he once employed shadow. In the 1980s Camargo had solo exhibitions in both the Rio and São Paulo museums of modern art, and he participated in the 1982 Venice Biennale.  Influence  One of the primary influences for Camargo was the constructivist art movement that was highly popular in Brazil during his time. Constructivist art was largely stimulated by the post-war economic boom and the rise of modernist trends in architecture. During the evolution of the Constructivist art movement, Sergio de Carmargo and his peers were inspired by two specific events, the establishment of the Biennial in 1951, and the inauguration of Brasilia in 1960. Artworks created during this period range widely in there different approaches to the rules of constructivist art. The contributions of these artists began a highly original period in the history of modernism. When it comes to the whole of Brazilian art there are few independent artists like Camargo that simplified an already complex visual language through his “highly iconoclastic approaches”. Brazilian constructivism lies within the need to have universal communion and communication. Artistically, Carmargo has often been linked to either the Neo- Concrete Constructivism or Op Art Kineticism art movements. He is often compared with his Brazilian colleagues, such as Lygia Clark, Mira Schendel, and Hélio Oiticica. However, Carmargo was never clearly aligned with any one movement. While Camargo’s work was distinctly a part of the constructivism movement he adapted the rules in order to more accurately communicate his thoughts. Camargo’s work has been linked due to its distinct reliance on simplicity, systems, and uniformity through volumetric elements and color. Critic Ronaldo Brito refers to Camargo’s work as “the madness of order”. Carmargo confronts the human perception of a paradigm and attempts to break understanding of the laws of the object. Camargo does not interrogate this subject in a conceptual realm but through the ever-changing effects of visual light. It is because of his unique style, that Camargo stands apart from his contemporary peers.  Exhibitions  Camargo’s work is represented in the collections of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY; Birmingham Museum of Art, AL; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Dallas Museum of Art; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC; Kunstmuseum, Bern, Switzerland;Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Tate Modern, London. In 2000, the Paço Imperial, Rio de Janeiro, opened a permanent exhibition space for the artist, which includes a replica of his art studio in Jacarepaguá, Brazil. Camargo’s work has been the subject of major retrospectives at the Museu de Arte Moderna, Rio de Janeiro, in 1993; the Stedelijk Museum, Schiedam, in 1994; and the Instituto de Arte Contemporânea, São Paulo, in 2010, which traveled to the Museu Oscar Niemeyer, Curitiba, Brazil, in 2012.

Both sides have been accused of torture, unlawful killings, arbitrary arrests, and abductions. Nepal was home to the most disappearances in the world during the conflict. The conflict is also considered one of major reasons for lack of development in Nepal. The conflict also resulted in a reduction in human rights in the realms of poverty, health, education, and gender equality. Issues in these realms continue to persist today. Nepalese people face discrimination based on ethnicity, caste, and gender, and citizens living in rural parts of Nepal face a lack of access to adequate health care, education, and other resources. Violence continues to plague the country, particularly towards women. Economic inequality is prevalent, and health issues persist— including high child mortality rates in some areas, mental illness, and insufficient health care services. However, things have started to change after 2006, when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed between the government, political parties and the Maoists to end a decade-long conflict from 1996-2006 and restore democracy and rule of law in Nepal. History=1996–2006 conflict From 1996 to 2006, Nepal experienced a violent conflict between the Nepalese government and the rebel political group the Communist Party of Nepal (the Maoists). The Maoists took arms against the Nepalese government to fight against what they saw as corrupt and discriminatory regime.

According to Parker (2013), approximately 13,000 people died (including 500 children) and 100,000-200,000 Nepalis were displaced (including 40,000 children) during the war. Child Workers in Nepal reports that 27,323 children were taken from their communities to contribute to the war, possibly as child soldiers. Nepal ranked as the country with the most disappearances worldwide from 1996–2006.Parker, Sara, Kay Standing, and Bijan Pant. \\"Caught in the Cross Fire: Children’s Right to Education During Conflict - The Case of Nepal 1996-2006.\\" Children & Society 27, no. 5 (2013): 372-84.

Both sides of the conflict engaged in torture and indiscriminate killings, and civilians often became unintentional casualties or were attacked for allegedly supporting the opposing side. The conflict caused deterioration in human rights conditions across Nepal. Human capabilities in the realms of health, education, gender equality, torture, child rights and more have been obstructed. =Torture= The government forces and the Maoists have both been accused of torturing political prisoners and those they suspect oppose their views during the 1996-2006 conflict, including children. There is evidence that Nepalese police have also tortured, particularly during the conflict. According to Stevenson (2001), forms of torture used during the conflict include physical, sexual, and psychological methods. The government used rape as a means of torture as well. Singh et al. (2005) reports that 70% of Nepalese inmates were tortured in prison, and the Center for Victims of Torture estimates that 16,000 people were tortured per year during the war. Both the Maoists and the Nepalese government used torture techniques to extract confessions and to force citizens to act in accordance with their dictates. Stevenson (2001) reports that 50% of torture victims stated they only confessed because of the torture they received. The long-lasting effects of torture can include physical issues such as disability, lingering pain, and weakness. Mental effects have also been documented, such as posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, sleep problems, eating difficulties, and dissociative disorders. =Disappearances, arrests, executions= From 1996–2006, Nepal ranked as the country with the most disappearances recorded. The Nepalese government also frequently arrested and killed people with no explanation and no due process. Among the arrests, disappearances, and executions were civilians who were suspected of being against the government, NGO workers, and journalists. The Maoists have been accused of arresting and killing civilians as well. During the conflict, they also took students to be trained to assist the Maoist forces, and possibly to become child soldiers. According to Child Workers in Nepal, approximately 27,323 children were taken. The Maoists will not admit to training and using child soldiers, however, though researchers such as Parker (2013) claim there is evidence that they did. The Maoists educated the students in their political point of view as well. Current issues Current human rights issues include poverty (particularly in rural areas), education disparities, gender inequality, health issues, and child rights violations.United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2014. Nepal Human Development Report 2014. New York: UNDP. Poverty Poverty is an ongoing detriment to human rights in Nepal. 42-45% of Nepalis are impoverished (surviving on income that falls beneath the poverty line) according to Parker (2013) and Paul (2012), while the 2014 Human Development Report for Nepal claims that 25% of Nepalis are in poverty. The UN gives 64.7% as the proportion in poverty using the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). Bhusal (2012) reports that at least 75% of Nepal's citizens are in poverty if the poverty line is considered to be $2 a day; according to Bhusal, this higher poverty line better accounts for the practical social and cultural obligations that Nepalis face. Some areas of Nepal lack sufficient food supply for children; in the worst areas, 60% of children live without adequate food. According to the Human Development, the country's Human Poverty Index (HPI) is 31.12, a relatively high number (where a higher HPI indicates increased poverty). However, Nepal's HPI has been declining over the past years, decreasing by 21.4% from 2001 to 2011. Poverty is particularly high in Nepal's rural regions, whose poverty levels are reported to be between 1.8 and 10 times those of cities. Paul (2012) has measured poverty levels at 4% in the capital city Kathmandu and 56% in the rural Mountain area. Paul also claims that the per capita income of people in urban areas is two times that of people in rural regions. Rural areas also do not receive as much aid from NGOs as urban areas do, further contributing to the disparities. In addition, researchers have observed that the most impoverished areas are slowest to show improvement. Researcher Lok P Sharma Bhattarai has stated that “[l]iving in the rural areas essentially means living in absence, struggling ‘hand to mouth’ and being powerless.” (Bhattarai 2012, 244.) Despite poor HPI numbers, levels of inequality across Nepal appear to be decreasing over time, according to the 2014 Human Rights Report for Nepal. However, Bhattarai (2012) claims that the number of people in poverty is rising, and according to Bhusal (2012), 80% of Nepalis have seen their quality of life go down within the last 15 years. Paul (2012) reports that Nepal's Gini coefficient is .51—a higher number than those of surrounding countries. Bhusal has also claimed that the top 20% of income earners brought in nine times the amount of money as the bottom 20% of income earners in 2005. Poverty is also linked with ethnicity and caste, though equality between ethnic groups and castes is increasing. However, ethnic minorities and some lower castes continue to experience higher rates of poverty. Health The 1996-2006 conflict in Nepal had a negative impact on health in the country. The violence was especially harmful to the health of women and children. The conflict prevented essential medical supplies from reaching those who needed them, particularly children. The maternal childbirth death rate during the conflict was at the high rate of 1 in 24. Medical staff's ability to work was also greatly impeded during the conflict, further harming the health of Nepalis. Staff was killed or arrested and hospitals were incapacitated. The violence forced many health workers to leave their jobs. Low health indicators continue to persist in Nepal today. Health prospects vary greatly depending on where an individual lives in Nepal and to which class he or she belongs. Bhuttarai (2012) reports that a study revealed 50% of poor Nepalis do not live within 30 minutes of a hospital. In addition, many areas in the country do not have adequate access to clean water and food. This is particularly problematic for rural parts of Nepal, where there are fewer doctors. The same Bhuttarai study shows that only 21% of rural Nepalis live within three hours of a public hospital; the rest must travel even greater distances to reach a doctor. Young child mortality rates in rural areas are also higher than they are in urban areas. Elderly citizens also tend to live in rural areas disproportionately, which obstructs their ability to receive healthcare. Finally, Bhuttarai reports that people living in rural areas tend to spend more money on health care than do city dwellers. Mental health is also a significant problem in Nepal. Researchers have measured a rise in mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder, which they think may have been caused by the violence of the 1996-2006 conflict. Suicide has also become more common. Though the demand for mental health treatment is high, there are only .22 psychiatrists, .06 psychologists, and 1.5 inpatient beds for every 100,000 people in Nepal, according to Luitel (2015). Throughout Nepal, primary care physicians don't have supplies of psychotropic drugs that they require, mental health workers are overwhelmed, and primary care doctors do not receive the guidance and training they need to effectively treat mental illness. Rural areas of Nepal tend to particularly lack adequate sources of mental health treatment as well, as most mental health professionals reside in urban regions. Singh (2005) reports that towards the end of the conflict, 30% of Nepalis had some form of mental health issue. According to Luitel, Nepalis with mental health problems face stigma and discrimination; such stigma can discourage people from seeking mental health care. Some attempts to improve the healthcare system in Nepal are in progress. Simkhada (2015) advocates for creating a public health protection organization in Nepal, in light of the recent global spread of disease. According to Simkhada, “This service is much needed in order to co- ordinate, strengthen, and support activities aimed at protecting the whole population of Nepal from infectious diseases, natural disasters and environmental hazards.” (Simkhada 2015, 442.) The organization would help to recruit qualified health workers, train health professionals, educate the public, improve the delivery of health resources, and promote health research. Education secondhanded textbook at rural side in Nepal Children's access to education was greatly disrupted during the 1996-2006 conflict between the Maoists and the Nepalese government. Students and teachers were attacked at school, and because of violence, some students were prevented from attending school during the conflict. Many schools were forced to close or faced reduced attendance because of attacks or threat of attack. Schools that remained open often held class for fewer hours, and student's time in the classroom overall decreased greatly during the war. The Maoists also occupied schools and used them as safe havens and as recruitment grounds. They taught children to be spies or messengers, and they took children to be trained to help the Maoist cause, possibly as child soldiers and child labourers. The Maoists forced teachers to use Maoist curricula and express Maoist political views, often compelling them to do so through violent means. Though the violence brought by the conflict was greatly detrimental to education, some Nepalis lauded the Maoists for making their school more inclusive to girls and those of lower caste, and for helping the school run more smoothly. Since the 2006 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, however, the violence has abated and more children are able to attend school. However, several studies report that many children are still lacking education opportunity. Parker (2013) says that 18% of children age five to nine are not receiving an education. However, the US State Department claims that 95% of boys and 94% of girls are enrolled in school.US State Department. \\"Nepal 2013 Human Rights Report\\". January 1, 2013. Accessed March 3, 2015. Paul (2012) reports that illiteracy in Nepal is currently at 64%. This number varies widely between rural and urban areas; Paul measured the illiteracy rate at 37% in urban areas and 67% in rural areas. Girls, children of lower caste, and ethnic minorities are still not given equal education opportunity. Children in rural areas also have reduced access to education, and children who were internally displaced persons (IDPs) during the war have had difficulty getting back to school. The quality of schools in Nepal has also been questioned. More resources are needed to fund the schools and particularly to provide better school facilities. Schools also lack skilled and competent teachers; more quality teacher training is necessary. In addition, more comprehensive curricula are needed to accommodate students from all backgrounds. Women Women in Nepal face discrimination, inequality, and violence. Violence against Nepali women takes the form of domestic abuse, sexual assault, rape, human trafficking, and general harassment. Laws against these crimes are frequently unenforced, and as a result many perpetrators do not face legal consequences. Women also often fail to report rapes and sexual harassment. According to the US State Department, one reason for the lack of sexual harassment reports is that Nepalis do not receive adequate education concerning the definition of sexual harassment. The State Department claims that continued custom of dowry giving (which is illegal) increases violence against women as well. Women also faced violence during 1996-2006 conflict; Singh (2005) reports that 5000–10,000 women were trafficked every year. In addition, women face inequalities in health, income, and education. Nepali women have a lower life expectancy than men, and medical care is preferentially given to boys over girls. Women in Nepal make 57% less than men, according to the 2014 Human Development report for Nepal, and the US State Department says that continuing violence women face limits their ability to support themselves. Though equality in education among girls and boys has increased since 2003 according to Parker (2013), education inequalities still persist. Researchers such as Raj et al. (2014) view these disparities as problematic, and present research that suggests girls who receive more education are less likely to be married before age 14 in Nepal. LGBT The Nepalese government, following the monarchy that ended in 2007, legalized cross dressing and a third gender option in 2007 along with the introduction of several new law sets. Cross-dressing was also illegal under various laws against public immorality but now is freely allowed. In the 2011 Nepal census, conducted in May 2011, the Central Bureau of Statistics officially recognized a third gender in addition to male and female. It also provides citizenship, passport, Ncell sim card registration, etc. with a third gender option. Yet there is not great acceptance for them in the society. Most of the violence and discrimination comes to third genders. Intersex rights Local intersex activists have identified human rights violations including significant gaps in protection of rights to physical integrity and bodily autonomy, and protection from discrimination. A first national meeting of intersex people look place in early 2016, with support from the UNDP. Slavery According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 234,600 people are enslaved in modern-day Nepal, or 0.82% of the population. One type of slavery in Nepal is kamlari, or domestic bonded labor. A child might be sold by their parents. Caste On June 1, 2020, HRW urged Nepali authorities to investigate the crimes committed against Dalits, after a number of caste based incidents emerged over the past week.

History  Rory and Wendy Alec in GOD TV's first transmission suite in Newcastle, England. GOD TV was founded by Rory and Wendy Alec in England in 1995 as the Christian Channel Europe, the Continent's first daily Christian television network. It started broadcasting on 1 October, two hours each day. This increased to seven hours in 1997 and 24-hours in 1999. The 'GOD' logo appeared in 1997 and the Christian Channel was rebranded as the GOD Channel. The GOD Channel became part of the Dream Family Network, later known as GOD Digital and then GOD TV in 2002. The same year GOD TV's broadcast uplink was moved to Israel. This provided for international expansion via satellite and GOD TV was launched across Africa and Asia with new offices in Cape Town and Chennai. In 2003 a GOD TV office was established in the US in Orlando FL and in 2005 GOD TV launched across Australia and New Zealand. GOD TV launched on DIRECTV, America's largest satellite platform in 2006 and opened a new office in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 2008. GOD TV also expanded into China during 2008. Further offices were opened in Nairobi and Melbourne in 2009. Rory Alec was the network's CEO from 1995 to 2014, when GOD TV announced his resignation due to \\"moral failure.\\" The couple divorced in 2015. Wendy Alec attributed the end of their marriage to Satan leading her husband to have an affair. Wendy Alec took over as President and CEO, a position she held for two years, before appointing Ward Simpson. In January 2018, GOD TV launched www.godtv.com as a new digital publishing arm of the organization. Communications scholar Pradip N. Thomas places the history of GOD TV into the larger context of a neo- imperialist project within Christian fundamentalism, comparing GOD TV's Christian Zionist messages to Franklin Graham's travel to wartime Baghdad, which Graham presented as a triumph of Christianity over Islam. Thomas notes that in India, GOD TV provides a platform for a \\"closing of ranks\\" among different Indian Christian groups, allowing an expression of Christian unity which is partly a reaction against Hindu nationalism.  Programming  Much of GOD TV's programming caters to a youth audience.'30 Emerging Voices' - \\"The Alecs... produce programs that are hip and sophisticated for younger viewers who can't stomach most other religious programming. Unless other broadcasters figure out a way to reconnect with younger viewers, it is likely that GOD TV's debut in the United States will send channel surfers in the Alecs' direction.\\", Charisma (magazine), Lake Mary, FL, 31 July 2005. The network aims to air 'relevant youth programming' that comprises series and events from leading youth ministries and featuring bands such as Leeland, Switchfoot, Rend Collective, Jars of Clay, Guvna B and Newworldson. GOD TV publishes content by Exodus International and Focus on the Family that advocates for conversion therapy, the pseudoscientific practice of attempting to change sexual orientation.

Themed weekends have included The Persecuted Church season and the Refugees #LoveYourNeighbour Season. GOD TV's original programming includes In Depth interview series and documentaries. The network often features live broadcasts.  Criticism  According to the BBC, GOD TV was criticized by the organizations Pride in Plymouth and Plymouth Humanists for inviting televangelist Andrew Wommack to \\"publicly preach discrimination towards LGBT people\\" at an annual gathering in 2015. David Amsalem, Israeli Minister of Communications, warned GOD TV's Israeli affiliate in May 2020 that it may be in violation of a law against proselytising and risks being shut down. It was later determined to violate said law and was ordered off Israeli airspace a month later in June. Television satirist and critic Victor Lewis- Smith described GOD TV's programming as \\"hour upon hour of hate-filled, rabble-rousing, homophobic bigotry, much of it featuring (and funded by) right-wing American evangelists\\" in 2002.  Regional programming  GOD TV has several specific regions, each with its own regional director and office overseeing local content, distribution and providing viewer services. The regions are: the USA; UK, Europe, Scandinavia and Nordic countries; Africa and East Africa; Asia and the Middle East; Israel; Sri Lanka and Australasia.

It spans the 150–180th degree of the zodiac. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this area on average between August 23 and September 22, and the Sun transits the constellation Virgo from approximately September 16 to October 30. Individuals born during these dates, depending on which system of astrology they subscribe to, may be called Virgos or Virgoans; they are also represented in newspaper horoscopes with other astrological signs. The symbol of the maiden is based on Astraea. In Greek mythology, she was the last immortal to abandon Earth at the end of the Silver Age, when the gods fled to Olympus – hence the sign's association with Earth. Origins The constellation Virgo has multiple different origins depending on which mythology is being studied. Most myths generally view Virgo as a maiden with heavy association with wheat. In Greek and Roman mythology, they relate the constellation to Demeter, mother of Persephone, or Proserpina, the Roman goddess of the harvest. Another association is with the myth of Parthenos (meaning virgin in Greek), which explains how the actual constellation Virgo came to be. In the legend, Parthenos is the daughter of Staphylus and Chrysothemis, and sister to Rhoeo and Molpadia. Rhoeo had been impregnated by Apollo, but when her father discovered her pregnancy, he assumed it was by a random suitor and was greatly ashamed. As punishment, he locked her in a box and threw her in a river. After the terrible fate of their sister, Parthenos and Molpadia lived in fear of their father's terrible wrath. One evening, Staphylus left his daughters in charge of a very valuable bottle of wine. When they both accidentally fell asleep, one of their swine broke the bottle. Terrified of their father, the sisters fled to a nearby cliff and threw themselves off. But because of his previous relations with Rhoeo, Apollo saved his two sisters and delivered them to the safety of nearby cities in Cherronseos. Molpadia ended up in Castabus where she changed her name to Hemithea and was worshipped as a local goddess for many years. Parthenos settled in Bubastus where she was also worshipped as a local goddess. According to another story, Parthenos was a daughter of Apollo who made the constellation to commemorate her death at a young age. While this is only one myth of the origin of Virgo, she is seen throughout all manner of myths. In Egyptian mythology, the time when the Sun was in the constellation Virgo marked the beginning of the wheat harvest, thus connecting Virgo back to the wheat grain. In Judeo-Christianity, Jesus was born to a virgin in the town of Bethlehem (\\"bread\\"); the ancient Zodiac ended in the constellation Leo and began with Virgo. Virgo has the equivalent sign in Indian astrology as the Kanya (which also means \\"maiden\\"), and has even been connected with the Virgin Mary.

An ice rise forms where the ice shelf touches the seabed due to a locally increased elevation of the seabed, which however remains below sea level. (In contrast, an elevation in the seabed that extends above sea level is defined as an island). The ice shelf flows over the seabed elevation, completely covering it with ice, thereby forming an ice rise. The resulting stress increases cause crevasse formation around the ice rise. An island within and totally covered by the ice shelf may appear the same as an ice rise. Elaborate measurements may be required to distinguish between these two geographic features. Although ice rises are typically located within the ice shelf area, they can partially face the open sea. At present, ice rises are found only within the ice shelves of Antarctica. The largest ice rises exceed dimensions of 50 by 200 km, or 10 000 km² in area. Some ice rises are incorrectly called islands, but also a few totally ice-covered islands within an ice shelf are also called ice rises. Ice rises are of scientific significance because they (a) exert considerable buttressing, which affects the existence and rate of the marine ice sheet instability; and (b) they are very good sites for ice coring, owing to their being somewhat thinner than the main ice-sheet (hundreds of metres compared with thousands of metres).

The 7th Infantry Division (, 7 DP) was the name of several units of the Polish Army.  Second Polish Republic  The original division was formed on 14 May 1919 near Częstochowa. At that time it consisted of two infantry brigades (13th and 14th), and four infantry regiments (25th, 26th, 11th and 27th), as well as two artillery brigades (7th Light Artillery, 7th Heavy Artillery). The division took part in shielding of the Polish borders during the Polish–Ukrainian War of 1919. During the Polish–Soviet War it was commanded by Col. Szubert and reinforced to three brigades (13th Bde under Herman, 14th Bde under Pogórzelski and 7th Artillery Bde under Luberadzki). It took part in the Battle of the Niemen as part of the Polish 3rd Army. After the war the division was dispersed in several barracks in western Poland, among them in Częstochowa, Piotrków Trybunalski, Lubliniec and Łódź. In 1921, the structure of the division was changed: both infantry brigades were dissolved, and the 11th Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 23rd Infantry Division. In the Second Polish Republic, the division was commanded by the Fourth Military District from Łódź. The headquarters of the division were stationed in Częstochowa, and it consisted of the following units: * 25th Infantry Regiment (Piotrków Trybunalski), * 27th Infantry Regiment (Częstochowa), * 74th Upper Silesian Infantry Regiment (Lubliniec), * 7th Light Artillery Regiment (Częstochowa). In mid-1939, following Plan West, the 7th Division, commanded by General Janusz Gasiorowski, was attached to Kraków Army, which defended southwestern corner of Poland. The division, supported by Battalion Kłobuck of the National Defense, defended 40-kilometer long section of the Polish–German border, between the towns of Lubliniec and Krzepice, north of which units of Łódź Army were stationed. Due to quick advance of the panzer units of the Wehrmacht, in the night of 1/2 September 1939, the division retreated from its positions near Kłobuck and Truskolasy, and manned main defence line around Częstochowa. During the retreat, a squadron of divisional cavalry was destroyed by the enemy. After bloody fighting near Częstochowa, the division was forced to retreat further east: on 2 September, General Gasiorowski received the order of General Antoni Szylling, commandant of Kraków Army, to begin the retreat in the evening. After a night march, the 7th Division reached the area of Lelów, where on 3 September in the morning its 74th Regiment was attacked by the 2nd Light Division. Polish losses were very high, while the enemy lost almost 50 tanks and other vehicles. In the afternoon of 3 September, the division tried to break out of the encirclement. The advance, supported by divisional artillery, was at first successful, but after some time, German machine gun fire together with tanks halted the Poles. In the evening decimated units of the 7th Division tried once again to break out. Elements of the 74th Regiment, together with cavalry and sappers, managed to reach Kielce on 5 September. Most of the division, however, suffered such heavy losses that it was unable to fight any longer. In the early afternoon of 4 September, the division surrendered to the Germans.  World War Two and After 1945  After the Sikorski–Mayski agreement of 1941, in February of the following year the 7th Division was recreated in the Soviet Union as part of the Anders Army/Polish Armed Forces in the East. Withdrawn to Persia, it was disbanded and its units were attached to the 6th Division. During the Operation Tempest, the division was recreated by the Radom-Kielce inspectorate of Armia Krajowa. Composed of two regiments (27th and 74th), it took part in heavy fights against the Germans. After central Poland had been taken over by the Soviet Army, the majority of its soldiers returned to the underground, risking arrest by the omnipotent NKVD (see Cursed soldiers). At the same time one of the units of the Polish People's Army formed under guidance of the Soviet Union received the same number (see :pl:7 Łużycka Dywizja Piechoty). Formed north of Lublin, it was formed of three infantry regiments and one artillery regiment. Insufficiently equipped and trained, the unit was attached to the Second Army and dispatched to the front near Rothernburg, where it stormed the Lusatian Neisse river with heavy casualties. After several days of heavy fighting on a bridgehead to the west of the river, the division was levied and withdrawn to the rear. After the war ended, the PPA 7th Infantry Division, under the control of the Second Army, was assigned to protect the Mużakowa - Kopaczów section of the western border. The divisional headquarters was stationed at Lubań, with regimental staff at Mirsk (33rd Infantry Regiment), Zgorzelec (35th Infantry Regiment), Bogatynia (37th Infantry Regiment), and Jędrzychowice (38th Artillery Regiment). Since 1947, the sub- units became a part of Operational Group Wisła. Before being transferred from OW IV to OW V, in 1949 the division was stationed as follows: * Divisional headquarters - Bytom * 33rd Nysa Infantry Regiment - Nysa * 35 Infantry Regiment - Tarnowskie Gory * 37 Infantry Regiment - Chorzów * 38 Light Artillery Regiment - Kedzierzyn-Kozle * 10 Anti-tank artillery squadron - Tarnowskie Gory * 18 Sapper Battalion - Bytom * Communications Company 27 - Bytom In accordance with Ordinance No. 0026/Org. of the Minister of National Defence, on 4 September 1956, the 7 Łużycka Infantry Division was reorganized as the 2nd Warsaw Mechanized Division. The division headquarters was at Nysa.

It spans 180°–210° celestial longitude. The Sun transits this sign on average between September 23 (September equinox) and October 22. Under the sidereal zodiac, the Sun currently transits the constellation of Libra from approximately October 31 to November 22. The symbol of the scales is based on the Scales of Justice held by Themis, the Greek personification of divine law and custom. She became the inspiration for modern depictions of Lady Justice. The ruling planet of Libra is Venus. Libra is the only zodiac constellation in the sky represented by an inanimate object. The other eleven signs are represented either as an animal or mythological characters throughout history.  Air sign  Libra is one of the three zodiac air signs, the others being Gemini and Aquarius. In astrology, a broad description of those who are born under these signs are calm, rational, and detached when dealing with situations. The sign of Libra is symbolized by the scales and is associated with the Roman deity Iustitia. According to the writer Manilius, Roman judges are born under the sign of Libra. The Moon was said to be in Libra when Rome was founded and this was based on the historical passage, which state \\"qua condita Roma\\". Everything was balanced under this righteous sign. Manilius once said that Libra was the sign \\"in which the seasons are balanced\\". Both the hours of the day and the hours of the night match each other. Thus why the Romans put so much trust in the \\"balanced sign\\". Going back to ancient Greek times, Libra the constellation between Virgo and Scorpio used to be ruled over by the constellation of Scorpio. They called the area the Latin word \\"chelae\\", which translated to \\"the claws\\" which can help identify the individual stars that make up the full constellation of Libra, since it was so closely identified with the Scorpion constellation in the sky. According to the tropical system of astrology, the Sun enters the sign of Libra when it reaches the northern autumnal equinox and the southern vernal equinox, which occurs around September 22.

It spans the 270–300th degree of the zodiac, corresponding to celestial longitude. Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this area from about December 21 to January 21 the following year, and under the sidereal zodiac, the sun transits the constellation of Capricorn from approximately January 16 to February 16. In astrology, Capricorn is considered an earth sign, negative sign, and one of the four cardinal signs. Capricorn is said to be ruled by the planet Saturn. There appears to be a connection between traditional characterisations of Capricorn as a sea goat and the Sumerian god of wisdom and waters, Enki, who also had the head and upper body of a goat and the lower body and tail of a fish. Later known as Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology, Enki was the god of intelligence (gestú, literally \\"ear\\"), creation, crafts; magic; water, seawater and lakewater (a, aba, ab). In Hindu astrology, the equivalent of Capricorn is Makara, the Crocodile. Cultural significance  In India, the zodiac sign of Capricorn is celebrated as the Makara Sankranti festival, also known in Nepal as Maghe Sankranti. The Indian astronomical calendar is not based on the western Gregorian or Julian date keeping system. The Gregorian calendar has fixed days in a year and does not accommodate difference in the actual solar year. Therefore, the festival is celebrated on either of 14 or 15 January every year, when, as per the Indian astronomical calendar, the Sun actually enters the Capricorn sign.

Moorcroft Ltd, trading as Moorcroft is a British art pottery manufacturer based in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, which was founded by William Moorcroft in 1913. History In 1897 Staffordshire pottery manufacturers James Macintyre & Co. Ltd garnered a prodigious talent by employing 24-year- old William Moorcroft as a designer, and within a year he was put in full charge of the company's art pottery studio. Moorcroft's first innovative range of pottery, called Florian Ware, was a great success and won him a gold medal at the World's fair, the St. Louis International Exhibition in 1904. Unusually at that time, he adopted the practice of signing his name, or his initials, on nearly all the pottery he designed, the production of which he personally oversaw. In due course the extent to which his success had overshadowed Macintyre's other manufacturing activities resulted in resentment on the part of his employers, culminating in their decision in 1912 to close down his studio. He then set up his own company and the following year production of his pottery was transferred to a brand new factory nearby. The Moorcroft factory produced an extensive array of moderately-priced domestic tableware items in addition to its famous tubelined, hand-painted art pottery. Moorcroft's reputation was enhanced when Queen Mary, a keen collector of his works, granted him a royal warrant in 1928. Shortly before the death of William in 1945, his elder son, Walter Moorcroft, took control of the business, which he continued to develop. The company's royal warrant was re- issued in his name in 1946. Between its founding and its leadership under Walter Moorcroft, the company had been financed in collaboration with the famous London store, Liberty. The Liberty store's interest was bought out by Moorcroft in 1962. Rising fuel and labour costs brought Moorcroft, with its highly labour-intensive techniques, into financial difficulties and in an attempt to mass-produce Moorcroft pottery, part of the company was sold to the Roper Brothers in 1984. This attempt was unsuccessful, and in 1986 Roper Brothers' share was resold to business partners Hugh Edwards and Richard Dennis. In 1992 Dennis and his pottery designer wife, Sally Tuffin, left the company, leaving the Edwards family as sole owners (remaining so in 2008). Walter Moorcroft retired as the director of design in 1987, but continued to contribute until his last design, 'Rock of Ages', was launched in 1999. In 1993, 24-year-old Rachel Bishop joined the company as its senior designer. By claiming the original establishment of the Macintyre studio under William Moorcroft in 1897 as its own founding date, in 1997 Moorcroft celebrated its centenary. During 1998 it established a new Moorcroft Design Studio and employed several designers to extend the range of its products. Moorcroft Pottery Early in his employment at Macintyre's, William Moorcroft created designs for the company's Aurelian Ware range of high-Victorian pottery, which had transfer-printed and enamelled decoration in bold red, blue and gold colours. Introduced very soon afterwards, his art nouveau-influenced Florian Ware was decorated entirely by hand, with the design outlined in trailed slip using a technique known as tubelining. This technique has been used in almost all of Moorcroft's art pottery ever since, distinguishing it from mass- produced pottery. Both father and son also experimented with high-temperature flambé techniques, producing high glaze with vibrant colour. Later Walter Moorcroft designs reflect the simpler appearance preferred during his era. Moorcroft Design Studio patterns show strong influences from the founding days of William Moorcroft coupled with the advances in colouring techniques of more recent years. Aimed at the luxury end of the collector and gift markets, they are generally in the form of such products as display plates, vases, pin dishes, lamp-bases and jars of varying shape and size.

The Roman Question (; ) was a dispute regarding the temporal power of the popes as rulers of a civil territory in the context of the Italian Risorgimento. It ended with the Lateran Pacts between King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Pope Pius XI in 1929.  International interest  On 9 February 1849, the Roman Republic took over the government of the Papal States. In the following July, an intervention by French troops restored Pope Pius IX to power, making the Roman Question a hotly debated one even in the internal politics of France. In July 1859, after France and Austria made an agreement that ended the short Second Italian War of Independence, an article headed \\"The Roman Question\\" in the Westminster Review expressed the opinion that the Papal States should be deprived of the Adriatic provinces and be restricted to the territory around Rome.\\"The Roman Question\\" in The Westminster Review, No. CXLI, July 1859, pp. 120–121 This became a reality in the following year, when most of the Papal States were annexed by what became the Kingdom of Italy. Claims of the Kingdom of Italy Italian unification process. On February 18, 1861, the deputies of the first Italian Parliament assembled in Turin. On March 17, 1861, the Parliament proclaimed Victor Emmanuel II King of Italy, and on March 27, 1861, Rome was declared Capital of the Kingdom of Italy. However, the Italian Government could not take its seat in Rome because a French garrison (which had overthrown the Roman Republic), maintained there by Napoleon III of France, commanded by general Christophe Léon Louis Juchault de Lamoricière, was defending Pope Pius IX. Following the signing of the September Convention, the seat of government was moved from Turin to Florence in 1865. The Pope remained totally opposed to the designs on Rome of Italian nationalism. Beginning in December 1869, the First Vatican Council was held in the city. Some historians have argued that its proclamation of the doctrine of papal infallibility in July 1870 had political as well as theological causes. In July 1870, the Franco-Prussian War began. In early August, Napoleon III recalled his garrison from Rome and could no longer protect what remained of the Papal States. Widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian government take Rome. The Italian government took no direct action until the collapse of Napoleon at the battle of Sedan. King Victor Emmanuel II then sent Count Gustavo Ponza di San Martino to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of protecting the pope. According to Raffaele De Cesare: The Italian army, commanded by General Raffaele Cadorna, crossed the frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that an unopposed entry could be negotiated. The Italian army reached the Aurelian Walls on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Pius IX decided that the surrender of the city would be granted only after his troops had put up a token resistance, enough to make it plain that the takeover was not freely accepted. On 20 September, after a cannonade of three hours had breached the Aurelian Walls at Porta Pia, the Bersaglieri entered Rome (see capture of Rome). Forty-nine Italian soldiers and 19 Papal Zouaves died. Rome and the region of Lazio were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a plebiscite. Again, according to Raffaele De Cesare: Dilemma Pope Pius IX and succeeding popes Leo XIII, Pius X, Benedict XV, and Pius XI took great care not to recognize the legitimacy of the Italian government following the capture of Rome. Several options were considered, including giving the city a status similar to that of Moscow at the time (which, despite being the capital of Russia, was not the seat of government), but there was widespread agreement that Rome must be the capital to ensure the survival of the new state. However, Victor Emmanuel II of Italy refused to take residence in the Quirinal Palace, and foreign powers were likewise uneasy with the move. The British ambassador noted the apparent contradiction of a secular government sharing the city with a religious government, while the French foreign minister wrote: > If [Italy] would consent to view Florence as the seat of government, it > would solve the Papal question. It would show great sense, and the political > credit it would thereby garner, as well as the honor, would offer a > considerable advantage...Rome, under royal rule—an integral part of the > Italian nation, but remaining Holy or, better yet, the Dominant center of > the domain of the faith—would lose none of its prestige and would redound to > Italy's credit. And conciliation would then come about naturally, because > the pope would become accustomed to seeing himself as living in his own > home, not having a king around. However, the government refused such suggestions and the king eventually took up residence in the Quirinal Palace. Regarded by Roman citizens as the ultimate sign of authority in the city, the Quirinal had been built and used by previous popes. When asked for the keys, Pius IX reportedly said, \\"Whom do these thieves think they are kidding asking for the keys to open the door? Let them knock it down if they like. Bonaparte's soldiers, when they wanted to seize Pius VI, came through the window, but even they did not have the effrontery to ask for the keys\\". A locksmith was later hired.Kertzer 2004, pp. 79–83. Law of Papal Guarantees Italy's Law of Guarantees, passed by the senate and chamber of the Italian parliament on 13 May 1871, accorded the Pope certain honors and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the King of Italy, including the right to send and receive ambassadors who would have full diplomatic immunity, just as if he still had temporal power as ruler of a state. The law was intended to attempt to avoid further antagonizing the pope following unification and was roundly criticized by anti-clerical politicians across the political spectrum, particularly on the left. At the same time, it subjected the papacy to a law that the Italian parliament could modify or abrogate at any time. Pope Pius IX and his successors refused to recognize the right of the Italian king to reign over what had formerly been the Papal States, or the right of the Italian government to decide his prerogatives and make laws for him. Asserting that the Holy See needed to maintain clearly manifested independence from any political power in its exercise of spiritual jurisdiction, and that the Pope should not appear to be merely a \\"chaplain of the King of Italy\\",Pollard, 2005, p. 11. Pius IX rejected the Law of Papal Guarantees with its offer of an annual financial payment to the Pope. Despite the Italian state's repeated assurances of the Pope's absolute liberty of movement within Italy and abroad, the popes refused to set foot outside the walls of the Vatican and thereby put themselves under the protection of the Italian forces of law and order, an implicit recognition of the changed situation. Consequently, the description \\"prisoners of the Vatican\\" was applied to them, until the Lateran Treaty of 1929 settled the Roman Question by establishing Vatican City as an independent state. During this time, Italian nobility who owed their titles to the Holy See rather than the Kingdom of Italy became known as the Black Nobility as they were considered to be in mourning. Plans to leave Rome Several times during his pontificate, Pius IX considered leaving Rome a second time. He had fled Rome in disguise in November 1848, following the assassination of his Minister of Finance, Count Pellegrino Rossi. One occurrence was in 1862, when Giuseppe Garibaldi was in Sicily gathering volunteers for a campaign to take Rome under the slogan Roma o Morte (Rome or Death). On 26 July 1862, before Garibaldi and his volunteers were stopped at Aspromonte, Another instance and rumours of others occurred after the Capture of Rome and the suspension of the First Vatican Council. These were confided by Otto von Bismarck to Julius Hermann Moritz Busch: Lateran Treaty The Lateran Treaty resolved the Roman Question in 1929; the Holy See acknowledged Italian sovereignty over the former Papal States and Italy recognized papal sovereignty over Vatican City. The Holy See limited its request for indemnity for the loss of the Papal States and of ecclesiastical property confiscated by the Italian State to much less than would have been due to it under the Law of Guarantees. Literature Historical novels such as Fabiola and Quo Vadis have been interpreted as comparing the treatment of the popes by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy to the persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire.Pollard, 2005, p. 10.

Maximilian's direct heir was his distant cousin Count Palatine and Prince-Elector Charles Theodore (1724–1799), by prior succession agreements between the Bavarian and Palatinate branches of the Wittelsbach dynasty. Charles Theodore was amenable to an agreement with Emperor Joseph II that would allow him to acquire parts of the Austrian Netherlands in exchange for parts of his Bavarian inheritance. From 16 January 1778 Austrian troops moved into the Lower Bavarian lands of Straubing. Ultimately, both parties envisioned a wholesale exchange of the Bavarian lands for the Austrian Netherlands, but the final details were never concluded by treaty due to outside intervention. Charles Theodore too had no legitimate heirs, so his prospective successor was his Palatine cousin, Duke Charles II August of Zweibrücken (1746–1795). Charles August objected to an agreement which would deprive him of the Bavarian inheritance; he appealed to the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. His cause was taken up by the Prussian king Frederick the Great, who refused any increase in Austrian territory, and by Saxony, whose Wettin electoral house had married into the Wittelsbach family and therefore had allodial claims to parts of the inheritance. The War of the Bavarian Succession broke out with the invasion of the Prussian Army into Bohemia on 5 July 1778, after Austria and Prussia could not negotiate a solution to their differences. Due to difficulties in supplying the troops, the war became a stalemate: the Prussians were not able to advance far into the Bohemian lands, but the Austrians were unwilling to invade Saxony or Prussia. This was partly because Empress Maria Theresa (the mother of Joseph II and his co-ruler as Queen of Bohemia and Archduchess of Austria) firmly opposed the war after it became clear that a stalemate prevailed. She dispatched peace initiatives to King Frederick II of Prussia and forced her son to accept mediation by France and Russia. The peace came at the initiative of the Russian Empress Catherine the Great and was guaranteed by both Russia and France. Treaty Austrian ratification document (articles II to IV) of the Treaty of Teschen The accord dictated that the Habsburg Archduchy of Austria (Principality of Austria above the Enns) would receive the Bavarian lands east of the Inn river in compensation, a region then called \\"Innviertel\\", stretching from the Prince- Bishopric of Passau to the northern border of the Archbishopric of Salzburg. However, one of the requirements was that Austria would recognize the Prussian claims to the Franconian margraviates of Ansbach and Bayreuth, ruled in personal union by Margrave Christian Alexander from the House of Hohenzollern. Prussia finally purchased both margraviates in 1791. The Electorate of Saxony received a sum of six million guilders (florins) from Bavaria in exchange of its inheritance claims. With the accession of Elector Charles Theodore, the electorates of Bavaria and the County Palatine of the Rhine (i.e. the territories in the Rhenish Palatinate and the Upper Palatinate) were under the united rule of the House of Wittelsbach. Their electoral votes were combined into one per a provision in the earlier Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, thereby reducing the number of electorates in the Holy Roman Empire to eight. The Innviertel, except for a short time during the Napoleonic Wars, has remained with Upper Austria up to today. Aftermath In 1785, Maria Theresa's son and successor Emperor Joseph II of Austria made another try at attaching the Bavarian lands to his Habsburg possessions, and even contracted with Elector Charles Theodore to swap it for the Austrian Netherlands. However, Joseph II again did not agree to a full exchange of all provinces within the Austrian Netherlands and the agreement collapsed amidst tacit French opposition and overt Prussian hostility, with King Frederick II of Prussia raising the opposition by the Fürstenbund, an association of several Imperial princes. After the War of the Austrian Succession, Austria and Prussia had a long- standing rivalry for supremacy in Central Europe until 1866, termed Deutscher Dualismus (German dualism) in the German language area.

The trail was established in 1999 by the state of Illinois' General Assembly, five years prior to former President Reagan's death in June 2004. The Reagan Trail was the brainchild of the late mayor of Eureka, Illinois Joe Serangeli. A volunteer-run Reagan Trail Association maintained a web presence and promoted the trail for its initial years, but the board was dissolved in July 2016 and website transferred to the care of the Ronald W. Reagan Society of Eureka College. Destinations The trail takes on the general shape of a triangle, and can be summarized into the following segments: Monmouth to Eureka The southwest segment of the trail follows U.S. Route 34 from Monmouth, Illinois to Interstate 74 east to Galesburg, Illinois. It then follows I-74 east to Peoria, Illinois, and U.S. Route 24 east to Washington, Illinois and Eureka, Illinois. This segment has the following attractions: * Monmouth -- Reagan lived in Monmouth from 1918-1919. There is also a separate exhibit in the city. * Galesburg -- Reagan attended the first grade in Galesburg. At some point Reagan also lived in Galesburg. * Washington -- A frequent stop of Reagan when traveling to and from Eureka College. * Eureka -- Reagan went to college at Eureka College, located in the town of Eureka. Peoria to Tampico/Dixon The east segment of the trail starts at U.S. Route 24 in Peoria and follows Illinois Route 29 north to Bureau Junction, Illinois. It then follows Illinois Route 26 to Ohio, Illinois where it branches to Tampico, Illinois on Illinois Route 92 and Dixon, Illinois on Illinois 26. This segment has the following attractions: * Peoria Heights -- Contains two visitor's sites not related to Ronald Reagan. * Chillicothe -- Home of one of Reagan's close friends, George Taylor. * Henry -- Home of the trail's national headquarters and Visitor Center. * Princeton -- An antiquing destination and frequent underground railroad stop. * Ohio -- Another frequent stop of Reagan when traveling to and from college. * Tampico -- Birthplace of Ronald Reagan, Tampico Main Street Historic District, and the H.C. Pitney Variety Store. * Dixon -- Boyhood home of Ronald Reagan after age 9. The Dixon Historic Center, First Christian Church, Lowell Park, and the Wings of Peace and Freedom Park are all in Dixon.

Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278 (1936), was a United States Supreme Court case that ruled that a defendant's involuntary confession that is extracted by police violence cannot be entered as evidence and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Facts of the case Raymond Stuart, a white planter, was murdered in Kemper County, Mississippi on March 30, 1934. Arthur Ellington, Ed Brown, and Henry Shields, three black tenant farmers, were arrested for his murder. At the trial, the prosecution's principal evidence was the defendants' confessions to police officers. During the trial, however, prosecution witnesses freely admitted that the defendants confessed only after being subjected to brutal whippings by the officers: :\\"... defendants were made to strip and they were laid over chairs and their backs were cut to pieces with a leather strap with buckles on it, and they were likewise made by the said deputy definitely to understand that the whipping would be continued unless and until they confessed, and not only confessed, but confessed in every matter of detail as demanded by those present; and in this manner the defendants confessed the crime, and, as the whippings progressed and were repeated, they changed or adjusted their confession in all particulars of detail so as to conform to the demands of their torturers. When the confessions had been obtained in the exact form and contents as desired by the mob, they left with the parting admonition and warning that, if the defendants changed their story at any time in any respect from that last stated, the perpetrators of the outrage would administer the same or equally effective treatment.\\" One defendant had also been subjected to being strung up by his neck from a tree in addition to the whippings. The confessions were nevertheless admitted into evidence, and were the only evidence used in the subsequent one-day trial. The defendants were convicted by a jury and sentenced to be hanged. The convictions were affirmed by the Mississippi Supreme Court on appeal. Judgment In a unanimous decision, the Court reversed the convictions of the defendants. The opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Hughes who wrote that \\"the transcript reads more like pages torn from some medieval account than a record made within the confines of a modern civilization.\\" It held that a defendant's confession that was extracted by police violence cannot be entered as evidence and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

It premiered in the Heartland Film Festival in October 2001, and made its limited theatrical release on August 23, 2002. Plot Emily Lindstrom (Evan Rachel Wood), an aspiring 14-year-old violinist, spends her summer practicing for an audition to get into the InterMountain Youth Symphony Orchestra in Salt Lake City, while her two best friends, Laurel and Jenny (RuDee Lipscomb and Haley McCormick), go off to camp. She also runs a secret-keeping business, in which other children give her fifty cents to tell her a secret, which she promises to keep; this is a talent that she is normally very good at. Meanwhile, her parents are expecting another baby and seem to care more about it than her. Philip Lenox (Michael Angarano) and his family move in next door to the Lindstroms. While helping his family unpack, he accidentally breaks a valued chess piece, unknown to his parents, and is caught by Emily as he attempts to bury it in the front garden. He pays her fifty cents to keep his deed a secret, and to hide the piece in her treasure trunk (along with other broken property from her other clients, in paper bags labeled with their names). When Emily invites Philip to join her in an afternoon tea session using her family's expensive and irreplaceable china, they accidentally break two of the teacups. She is faced with the challenge of keeping her own secret and having someone else know about it. Meanwhile, as he begins falling for her, his older brother, David (David Gallagher), enters the picture. He had been at tennis camp, but was expelled because he allegedly got drunk and was involved in a car accident. Philip tells her this family secret in exchange that she tells him a secret about her secret greetings with her friends. She starts getting upset, and says that a person who drinks and drives will do it again, before storming off. She then starts to lose her secret-keeping talent as she falls for David. He also begins falling for her, which makes Philip jealous. During her mother's baby shower, David tries to talk to Emily and she reveals that she knows how he was expelled from tennis camp. Afterward, she goes to get her violin from the roof and falls to the ground, necessitating a trip to the hospital. While she is there, her mother gives birth to her new sister, Grace. Everyone is by her hospital bed except David, who is eavesdropping behind the curtain. They ask if Grace looks like she did when she was a baby, and she reveals that she is adopted. Her birth parents were killed by a drunk driver when she was 10 months old, and it's considered a miracle that she lived. The driver was sentenced to a year in prison and, less than a month after being released, crashed into someone else's car and killed himself. Upon hearing this, David feels very guilty and understands why she despises him so much. After she is released from the hospital, she and Philip return all of the paper bags to her clients. To thank him, she kisses him on the cheek. Then David appears, and gives him her first official kiss.

As a result, Ballhausplatz is often used as shorthand for the Austrian Federal Chancellery. Until 1918 the Foreign Ministry of Austria-Hungary was also housed here. Similar to Downing Street or the Hotel Matignon, the word Ballhausplatz (or Ballplatz for short) is a synecdoche for the seat of power. Ballhausplatz is located in the first district Innere Stadt in central Vienna, a few minutes' walk from the Austrian Parliament Building and on the edge of the grounds of Hofburg Imperial Palace. Until 1754 the square itself did not exist, as an imperial hospital was located there. Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor erected a real tennis house there, the Ballhaus (ball house). Later the building was used for the Imperial Court Construction Office (Hofbauamt). At the end of the 18th century the Ballhaus was ripped down.  History of occupancy  Ballhausplatz 2 is the official residence of the Federal Chancellor. It was constructed in 1717/19 by the architect Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and expanded in 1766 by Nicolò Pacassi under the guidance of Chancellor Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz. Originally called the Geheime Hofkanzlei (Secret Court Chancellery), it was expanded in 1881 and again in 1902, when the Haus-, Hof-, und Staatsarchiv (today the Austrian State Archive) were added on the site of the former Minoritenkloster monastery, next to the Minoritenkirche. The main facade has largely remained the same since its construction by von Hildebrandt. The interior is richly decorated with stucco. The building suffered heavy damage during World War II due to aerial bombardments, but was repaired. Located on the first floor are the offices of the Federal Chancellor, federal ministers, and conference rooms. The Government of Austria regularly meets here for cabinet meetings. Ballhausplatz 2 played an important role in European politics for over 250 years. It was here that Chancellor Klemens Wenzel von Metternich held the Congress of Vienna, which was held after Napoleon Bonaparte's defeat in 1814 and resulted in the \\"balance of power\\". Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß was murdered by Nazis in his office in 1934. His successor Kurt von Schuschnigg gave his farewell speech shortly before Austria was annexed by Nazi-Germany in 1938 with his famous closing words \\"Gott schütze Österreich\\" (\\"God save Austria\\"). After 1945 and the restoration of independence the offices of the Federal Chancellor were once again located here. During the Schüssel coalition between the conservative ÖVP and the far-right FPÖ in the years 2000 to 2007, regular demonstrations against this government have been held in front of the Chancellor's office. Ballhausplatz 1 is the address of the Office of the President of Austria (Österreichische Präsidentschaftskanzlei). The offices of the president himself are located in the Hofburg Imperial Palace.

They died in the attempt, and he was succeeded in the viscountcy by a distant cousin, a clergyman. In the same week that the unfortunate Viscount met his death, the family home of Cowdray House was destroyed by fire; a circumstance which provided the foundation for a factitious legend of a \\"curse of fire and water\\" upon the Browne family for having received Battle Abbey at the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

They lived at Midgham House in Berkshire and at Cowdray; as per the myth both their sons drowned at nearby Bognor Regis on 7 July 1815. As a result, the estate a generation later was sold by the surviving daughters mostly to George Perceval, 6th Earl of Egmont, and perhaps to Lord Leconfield, with Cowdray passing in 1908 to Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray.

He was born in Williamsburgh Township in Upper Canada in 1820. His family operated a timber business along the South Nation and Castor Rivers in the eastern part of the province. The firm's main office was situated in Morrisburg. The business expanded to include operations near Quebec City, Toronto and Barrie. In 1857, he was elected to the 6th Parliament of the Province of Canada representing Dundas. His uncle John Cook had earlier represented Dundas in the Legislative Assembly. His brother Hermon Henry served in the federal and provincial legislatures and his brother Simon served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. He died at Morrisburg in 1875.

A split (commonly referred to as splits or the splits) is a physical position in which the legs are in line with each other and extended in opposite directions. Splits are commonly performed in various athletic activities, including dance, figure skating, gymnastics, contortionism, synchronized swimming, cheerleading, martial arts and yoga as exercise, where a front split is named Hanumanasana and a side split is named Samakonasana. A person who has assumed a split position is said to be \\"in a split\\"Oxford English Dictionary, split, n. \\"4 b. the splits, in acrobatics or stage-dancing. Also in sing.\\" or \\"doing the splits\\". When executing a split, the lines defined by the inner thighs of the legs form an angle of approximately 180 degrees. This large angle significantly stretches, and thus demonstrates excellent flexibility of, the hamstring and iliopsoas muscles. Consequently, splits are often used as a stretching exercise to warm up and enhance the flexibility of leg muscles. A split that goes beyond 180° is called an oversplit. Variations There are two general forms of splits: * Side splits are executed by extending the legs to the left and right of the torso. Side splits are called straddle splits (or middle splits) in dance and yoga, and may be referred to as Chinese splits in martial arts. Other names include box splits and center splits; in yoga the pose is named Samakonasana. * Front splits are executed by extending one leg forward of, and the other leg to the rear of the torso. In dance, a front split is named according to the leg that is extended forward (e.g., the right leg is extended forward when executing a right split). In yoga a front split is called Hanumanasana. Front splits require hyper-extension of the iliofemoral ligament, otherwise the majority of the range of motion must come from the front hip joint. There are many variations of form and performance of splits, including: * Oversplit, in which the angle between the legs exceeds 180 degrees. * Suspended split, in which the body is static and supported only by the feet. * Split leap or split jump is a split that is executed after leaping or jumping, respectively, while still in the air. In figure skating, split jumps are sometimes called Russian jumps. They can be done as an exercise. * Standing split or vertical split, in which the leg lines are oriented vertically either to the side or to the front. This can also be an oversplit and a front oversplit with the back arched backwards, sometimes called a layout. * Twisting split is performed by transitioning from front split to side split, and then to the opposite front split. * Martial arts split is a front split in which the back leg is rotated so the inside edge of the foot rests on the ground. It is more commonly named a \\"half split\\". Image gallery Image:Shawn Sawyer Spin - 2006 Skate Canada.jpgA standing split during a figure skating spin. Image:Överspagat.jpgAn oversplit.

Usually, the reason for this is that the split is being performed improperly (the pelvis may need to be tilted forward). Another common problem encountered during splits (both front and side) is pain in the knees. Alt URL Popular culture Many people lack the flexibility required to execute a split and thus regard splits to be uncomfortable or even painful. Because of this widespread view, splits appear in slapstick comedy, schadenfreude, and other forms of entertainment.

It is also the oldest capitol building in Illinois to survive, as the first, second, and third capitol buildings have all disappeared. The brick Federal style state house has been operated by the state of Illinois as a monument of Illinois pioneer years since 1933. It is located in Vandalia, Illinois, on the National Road (and National Old Trails Road), and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Earlier capitols The Vandalia State House, Illinois's fourth capitol, was built when Illinois was in its eighteenth year as a state. Admitted to the Union in 1818, Illinois quickly abandoned its first governmental center of Kaskaskia, and its capitol building (active in 1818–1820). A second \\"state house\\" was built of lumber at the new capital of Vandalia, but it burned to the ground after only three years (1820–1823). The third capitol building (1824–1836), also built in Vandalia, was the scene of most of the service of Abraham Lincoln as a member of the Illinois state legislature. Lincoln did not, however, become a beloved figure in Vandalia. Elected from Sangamon County, closer to the geographic center of Illinois, Lincoln led a central Illinois caucus that called for the state government to move itself to the growing town of Springfield. As a result of this threat, Vandalia businessmen took action. In 1836, when the legislature was in recess, they abruptly tore down the third Capitol building and built a larger fourth one on the same public square. The cost of the new brick building was $16,000. Vandalia hoped that the new Vandalia State House would be so nice to work in that it would encourage the state government to remain in town. Exterior view in 2016The building the legislators entered in December 1836 did not have the front or rear portico. The cupola was octagonal and featured a rounded roofline. The brick building was not painted white. Legislators began the session upset by the presence of workmen and the odor of damp plaster. Later capitols When Lincoln and his colleagues returned to Vandalia in the fall of 1836, they saw the new \\"State House\\" waiting for them. They were not impressed. In February 1837, the legislature, under pressure from Lincoln and his colleagues, moved the governmental center to Springfield. The fifth Illinois capitol, a Springfield building now called the Old State Capitol State Historic Site, served that purpose from 1839 to 1876. It was then replaced by the sixth and current Illinois State Capitol, which has been occupied since 1876. Vandalia State House The state of Illinois gave the Vandalia State House (in operation in 1836-1839, only three years) to Vandalia's county, Fayette County, for use as the county courthouse. Porticoes were added to the courthouse in the late 1850s, which made the building a structure in the Greek Revival style. The building served as a courthouse between 1839 and 1933, when it reverted to the state. In 1933, the old courthouse became the Vandalia State House State Memorial, and an extensive program of interior refitting and reconstruction began. In 1985 the building became a State Historic Site within the new Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, which maintains the old state house and interprets it to its brief time as Illinois's fourth capitol building in 1836-39. Guided tours are offered and visitors can also view the period rooms on their own.

The district is located in Montgomery County, an affluent suburban county northwest of Washington, D.C., and extends through rural Frederick County to the Pennsylvania border. A Democrat, he was previously a member of the Maryland State Senate from 2007 to 2016. Prior to his election to Congress, he was a constitutional law professor at American University Washington College of Law, where he co-founded and directed of the LL.M. program on Law and Government and co-founded the Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project. Early life Raskin was born in Washington, D.C. on December 13, 1962 to a Jewish family. He is the son of progressive activist Marcus Raskin—a former staff aide to President John F. Kennedy on the National Security Council and co-founder of the Institute for Policy Studies—and Barbara (née Bellman) Raskin, a journalist and novelist. He graduated from Georgetown Day School in 1979, and received a B.A. from Harvard College (magna cum laude) in 1983 and a J.D. from Harvard Law School (magna cum laude) in 1987. He is a past editor of the Harvard Law Review.Editorial Board listing in \\"Front Matter.\\" Harvard Law Review, vol. 100, no. 1, 1986, p. 99. He represented Ross Perot in 1996 when Perot sued over being excluded from the Presidential Debates and Raskin also wrote a Washington Post op-ed which strongly condemned the Federal Election Commission and the Commission on Presidential Debates.Washington Post, October 30, 1996 Maryland legislature In November 2006, he was elected as a Maryland state senator for district 20, representing parts of Silver Spring and Takoma Park in Montgomery County. In 2012, he was named the majority whip for the Senate and was the chairman of the Montgomery County Senate Delegation, chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics Reform, and a member of the Judicial Proceedings Committee. Raskin was a strong proponent of liberal issues in the Maryland Senate and worked well with Republicans and moderate Democrats. He was the sponsor of bills advocating the repeal of the death penalty in Maryland, the expansion of the state ignition interlock device program, and the establishment of the legal guidelines for benefit corporations, a type of for- profit corporation that include a material societal benefit in their bylaws and decision-making processes. Raskin helped lead the fight to legalize same- sex marriage in Maryland. On March 1, 2006, during a Maryland State Senate hearing regarding same-sex marriage, Raskin was noted for his response to an opposing lawmaker: \\"Senator, when you took your oath of office, you placed your hand on the Bible and swore to uphold the Constitution. You did not place your hand on the Constitution and swear to uphold the Bible.\\" Raskin long championed efforts to reform marijuana laws and legalize medical marijuana in Maryland. Raskin introduced a medical marijuana bill in 2014 that was signed by Governor Martin O'Malley and went into effect in January 2015. A former board member of FairVote, Raskin introduced and sponsored the first bill in the country for the National Popular Vote, a plan for an interstate compact to provide for the first popular presidential election in American history. U.S. House of Representatives Raskin speaking at the 2017 Tax March 2016 campaign On April 19, 2015, The Baltimore Sun and The Washington Post reported that Raskin announced his campaign for Congress and stated, \\"My ambition is not to be in the political center, it is to be in the moral center.\\" The district's seven-term incumbent, fellow Democrat Chris Van Hollen, gave up the seat to make an ultimately successful run for the United States Senate.. During the primary, Raskin enjoyed the endorsement of the Progressive Action PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which grew from 72 members at the time of the endorsement, to 92 members in early 2020. Raskin won the crowded seven-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—with 33 percent of the vote. He was viewed as the most liberal candidate in the race. The primary election was the most expensive House race in 2016, and Raskin was heavily outspent. During the general election, Raskin was endorsed by the Bernie Sanders- affiliated political organizing network Our Revolution, and the community organizing effort People's Action. Raskin prevailed in the general election, defeating Republican Dan Cox with 60 percent of the vote. Tenure As his first action in Congress, Raskin and several other members of House of Representatives objected to certifying the election of Donald Trump as President because of Russian interference in the election and voter suppression efforts. Vice President Joseph Biden ruled the objection out of order because it had to be sponsored by at least one member of each chamber, and it had no Senate sponsor. In late June 2017, Raskin was the chief sponsor of legislation to establish a congressional \\"oversight\\" commission with the authority to declare a President \\"incapacitated\\" and removed from office under the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution. In April 2018, Raskin, along with Jared Huffman, Jerry McNerney, and Dan Kildee, launched the Congressional Freethought Caucus. Its stated goals include \\"pushing public policy formed on the basis of reason, science, and moral values,\\" promoting the \\"separation of church and state,\\" and opposing discrimination against \\"atheists, agnostics, humanists, seekers, religious and nonreligious persons.\\" Huffman and Raskin are co-chairs. Raskin supports banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, he voted in favor of the Equality Act and urged Congress members to do the same.Final Vote Results for Roll Call 217 In the midst of the Trump–Ukraine scandal, Raskin received a packet of documents from Rudy Giuliani by way of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The northern half of the park preserves a spruce- tamarack bog. A district of National Park Service rustic structures built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and National Youth Administration in the 1930s is on the National Register of Historic Places. The park is located north of the city of Bemidji.  Geology and landscape  The landscape in the park is the last stage of the glacier in Minnesota. As the ice melted 10,000 years ago, soil, gravel, and rock were deposited creating the park's rolling topography. Many swamps and bogs were formed when chunks of ice separated from the receding glacier and left depressions which filled with water. Lake Bemidji was created by two huge blocks of ice being left behind by the retreating glacier. The present landscape is not fixed. The land continues to change slowly due to the erosion by wind and water, shoreline wave action, and other acts of mother nature.  History  For hundreds of years, ancestors to the Dakota people fished and hunted around Lake Bemidji. Around 1750 the Anishinabe settled. The Anishinabe called the lake \\"Bemiji-gau-maug\\" meaning \\"cutting sideways through\\" or diagonally. This was a reference to the path of the Mississippi River through the lake. Later Europeans, unable to pronounce the Anishinabe name, simply referred to it as \\"Bemidji\\". In the late 19th century, European immigrants migrated to this region to harvest the white and Norway pine trees. During the peak of logging, the lumber mill on the south shore of Lake Bemidji was the center of logging in the nation. When the government purchased the land, a few areas within the park boundaries were in a virgin state, preserving the towering forests. In 1923, the Minnesota State Legislature set aside , establishing Lake Bemidji State Park. Today, the park has grown to over to serve 150,000 plus visitors a year.  Wildlife  The vegetation in the park supports many wildlife species. Birding is popular. Campers may hear the sounds of red-eyed and warbling vireos, rose-breasted grosbeaks, and many other song birds. Loons, eagles, herons, gulls, even osprey can be seen by the lakeshore. A hike on one of the park trails can yield a glimpse of a doe with her fawn, a porcupine having lunch halfway up a jackpine, or even an occasional black bear. Eastern chipmunks and red squirrels also adapt to the park's recreational areas. In the wetland areas of the park, waterfowl, beaver, muskrat, and mink can be found. In the evening, the park is filled with sounds of gray treefrogs, spring peepers, and chorus and wood frogs. The woodland sound of a barred owl, the flute-like song of the veery, and the hammering of a sapsucker all add to the wilderness experience. In all, nearly 50 species of mammals and almost 200 different kinds of birds can be seen throughout the year in Lake Bemidji State Park. Contact the park naturalist for current information on where and when to observe the variety of wildlife.  Recreation  Lake Bemidji State Park offers recreational activities year round. Activities include camping, hiking, biking, cross country skiing, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, picnicking, swimming, volleyball, fishing, boating and interpretive programs. Camping The park has 95 drive-in sites, including 43 electric sites, 4 pull-through sites, and 4 handicapped accessible sites. In winter, only one site is available to drive- in. This is a non-electric site. Other sites are available on a walk-in basis after deep snow cover. Two group camp sites are available. Bass Creek is a tent-only group camp that can accommodate up to 30 people. Water is available in the nearby parking area. The North Group Camp site accommodates up to 50 people and has three spaces for small trailers or pick-up campers. The group camps are available in winter but access is on foot. For group camp reservations, contact the state park reservation service at 1-866-85PARKS or online at www.stayatmnparks.com. Trails In the summer, there are of handicapped accessible trails, including the boardwalk and Rocky Point trail; of easy to moderate hiking trails that take you through areas of maturing pine, aspen and hardwoods; of paved bike trails which connect with the Paul Bunyan state trail; 5 Miles of mountain bike trails; and a 1/4 mile Bogwalk which is accessible by a hike. The course for the Bemidji Blue Ox Marathon, first run in October 2013, travels through the park on the paved trails. In the winter, there are of groomed cross country ski trails, of snowmobile trails that connect with an extensive trail system beyond the park, and you can showshoe anywhere in the park except the groomed trails. Showshoes can be rented at the park office. Recreational facilities In the summer, park visitors can use the lakefront picnic and beach area which has picnic tables, an enclosed shelter with a fireplace, a volleyball court, a shower, restrooms, and pedestal grills. The shelter building and the sanitation building in the park were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the National Youth Administration, and are of rustic style log construction. These buildings are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Shelter can be reserved by calling the park office. There is a boat landing located next to the picnic area for those that wish to go fishing or boating. Canoes and fishing boats are available for rent from May 10 through October 13. There is also a handicapped accessible fishing pier. In the winter, snowshoes are available for rent at the park office. Or, visitors can park in the picnic area parking lot, bring their own ice fishing equipment, and walk onto the lake to go fishing. There is a warming house located in the Trail Center, in the park's Visitor Center Naturalist and interpretive programs Throughout the year, the Visitor Center is a place where information about the park's trails, animals, geology, and other interesting features can be found through exhibits, films or slide programs. A complete list of programs and special programs or organized groups is available upon request. Naturalist programs are offered Wednesday through Sunday from mid-June through Labor Day. Fall, winter and spring programs are generally offered on weekends. The Interpretive Center is open for schools, scouts and other community organizations upon request. Programs focus on the lake and wetland environments found in the park. Interpretive programs in the summer include, morning hikes, boat tours of Lake Bemidji, evening films, and campfire talks. Winter programs include snowshoeing, candlelight skiing, and animal tracking. The Visitor Center is open daily and sometimes serves as a gathering place for interpretive programs where visitors share experiences by the warmth of the woodstove.

To enable the encoding of semantics with the data, well-known technologies are RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language). These technologies formally represent the meaning involved in information. For example, ontology can describe concepts, relationships between things, and categories of things. These embedded semantics with the data offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and dealing with heterogeneous data sources. Overview In software, semantic technology encodes meanings separately from data and content files, and separately from application code. This enables machines as well as people to understand, share and reason with them at execution time. With semantic technologies, adding, changing and implementing new relationships or interconnecting programs in a different way can be just as simple as changing the external model that these programs share. With traditional information technology, on the other hand, meanings and relationships must be predefined and \\"hard wired\\" into data formats and the application program code at design time. This means that when something changes, previously unexchanged information needs to be exchanged, or two programs need to interoperate in a new way, the humans must get involved. Off- line, the parties must define and communicate between them the knowledge needed to make the change, and then recode the data structures and program logic to accommodate it, and then apply these changes to the database and the application. Then, and only then, can they implement the changes. Semantic technologies are \\"meaning-centered\\". They include subjects but not limited to: * encode/decode of semantic representation, * knowledge graph embedding relationships, * auto-recognition of topics and concepts, * information and meaning extraction, * semantic data integration, and * taxonomies/classification. Given a question, semantic technologies can directly search topics, concepts, associations that span a vast number of sources. Semantic technologies provide an abstraction layer above existing IT technologies that enables bridging and interconnection of data, content, and processes. Second, from the portal perspective, semantic technologies can be thought of as a new level of depth that provides far more intelligent, capable, relevant, and responsive interaction than with information technologies alone.

She is former student of Bernd and Hilla Becher. Like other Becher students – Axel Hütte, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff, Thomas Struth – Höfer's work is known for technical perfection and a strictly conceptual approach. From 1997 to 2000, she taught as professor at the Hochschule für Gestaltung, Karlsruhe. Höfer is the recipient of the 2018 Outstanding Contribution to Photography award, as part of the Sony World Photography awards. She is based in Cologne. Early life and education Candida Höfer was born in 1944 in Eberswalde, Province of Brandenburg. Höfer is a daughter of the German journalist Werner Höfer. From 1964 to 1968 Höfer studied at the Kölner Werkschulen (Cologne Academy of Fine and Applied Arts). After graduation, she began working for newspapers as a portrait photographer, producing a series on Liverpudlian poets. From 1970 to 1972, she studied daguerreotypes while working as an assistant to Werner Bokelberg in Hamburg. She later attended the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1973 to 1982, where she studied film under Ole John and, from 1976, photography under Bernd Becher.\\"Artist Candida Hofer\\", Sean Kelly Gallery, Retrieved online 14 October 2018. Along with Thomas Ruff, she was one of the first of Becher’s students to use color, showing her work as slide projections. While at school, she conceived a film which she shot jointly with Tony Morgan in the Düsseldorf ice cream parlour Da Forno in 1975.Candida Höfer. Düsseldorf, September 14, 2013 – February 9, 2014 Museum Kunstpalast, Düsseldorf. Work Höfer initially worked with black-and-white photography, such as with Flipper (1973), a large photo-collage consisting of 47 gelatin silver prints. The images all depict pinball machines in arcades and pubs, sometimes seen with players and sometimes by themselves. Shortly afterwards, she began working on her 'Türken in Deutschland' (Turks in Germany) series (1973–1979), which follows Turkish migrant families in their new German homes. It was during this period that Höfer became interested in colour, as she felt it suited her works better, and in interior spaces and their impact on the people who inhabit them and vice versa. Höfer began taking color photographs of interiors of public buildings, such as offices, banks, and waiting rooms, in 1979. Her breakthrough to fame came with a series of photographs showing guest workers in Germany, after which she concentrated on the subjects Interiors, Rooms and Zoological Gardens. Höfer specialises in large-format photographs of empty interiors and social spaces that capture the \\"psychology of social architecture\\". Her photographs are taken from a classic straight-on frontal angle or seek a diagonal in the composition.Candida Höfer: TIMESPACES, August 30 – September 30, 2005 Kukje Gallery, Seoul. She tends to shoot each actionless room from an elevated vantage point near one wall so that the far wall is centered within the resulting image. From her earliest creations, she has been interested in representing public spaces such as museums, libraries, national archives or opera houses devoid of all human presence. Höfer’s imagery has consistently focused on these depopulated interiors since the 1980s.Spaces: Photographs by Candida Höfer and Thomas Struth, June 12 – September 5, 2011 Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown. Höfer groups her photographs into series that have institutional themes as well as geographical ones, but the formal similarity among her images is their dominant organizing principle. In her Zoologische Gärten series (1991), Höfer shifted her focus away from interiors to zoos in Germany, Spain, England, France and the Netherlands. Implementing her typically descriptive style, Höfer’s images again seek to deconstruct the role institutions play in defining the viewer’s gaze by documenting animals in their caged environments.Candida Höfer: Zoologische Gärten, March 11 – April 10, 2010 Rena Bransten Gallery, San Francisco. In 2001, for Douze-Twelve, commissioned by the Musée des Beaux-Arts et de la Dentelle in CalaisCorinne LaBalme (April 15, 2001), 'The Burghers of Calais' Being Restored in Rome The New York Times. and later shown at Documenta 11, Höfer photographed all 12 casts of Auguste Rodin’s The Burghers of Calais in their installations in various museums and sculpture gardens.David Galloway (June 15, 2002), Documenta 11: the retro- ethno-techno exhibition The New York Times. From 2004 to 2007, she traveled the world to photograph conceptual artist On Kawara's iconic Date Paintings in the homes of private collectors. In 2005, Höfer embarked upon a project at the Musée du Louvre, documenting its various galleries, examining not only the sacred art they exhibit but also their individual design, arches, tiles and embellishments, with spectators and tourists entirely absent. Major exhibitions Höfer’s first solo exhibition was in 1975 at the Konrad Fischer Galerie in Düsseldorf. Since then, Höfer has had solo exhibitions in museums throughout Europe and the United States, including the Centro de Fotografía at the Universidad de Salamanca, the Galerie de l’École des Beaux-Arts in Valenciennes, the Kunsthalle Bremen, the Louvre, the Kunsthalle Nürnberg, the Kunsthaus Hamburg, the Museum of Contemporary Photography (MoCP)), the Museum Folkwang, and the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn She has also had an exhibition at the Portikus in Frankfurt am Main, She was included by Okwui Enwezor in Documenta 11 in Kassel in 2002.

Publication history The series debuted in 2000 and ran for 12 issues, a prologue and a preview comic called Steampunk Catechism. Originally planned for 24 issues, lack of readership ended the series at the end of act II. Joe Kelly's non-linear storytelling and Bachalo's highly detailed, though possibly confusing, penciling style received little interest from the mainstream comic-reading public. The series did have its supporters, especially Bachalo himself, saying, “I really enjoyed Steampunk. That was probably my favorite book that I’ve worked on.” Despite the early cancellation, Bachalo still has a desire to finish the series. Plot Steampunk tells the story of a young, poor fisherman, Cole Blaquesmith, who falls in love with a teacher, Miss Fiona in the mid-18th century. Fiona is an upper-class woman, who cares for the lower class and tries to educate them, which isn't well received by her peers. Fiona gives Cole an education, despite his lack of proper manners and his initial lack of interest for literature and arts. She also opens a school for the underprivileged. The school is burned down because Fiona was teaching the lower classes to think for themselves, an unpopular notion with the people in power. Over time, Fiona starts coughing and finally falls ill. No rational doctor can help her and, in his desperation, Cole takes her to doctor Absinthe, a mad genius, who is shunned by everybody else for performing horrible experiments, including grafting pieces of animals onto other animals. Absinthe promises to save Fiona, but needs Cole to do something for him to save her. He reveals the Engine, a machine capable of traveling through time (note: it is possible that the Engine is but a part of the time machine, though a vital, irreplaceable part). He tells Cole to travel to the future and take back all books on science and any objects that he can find. Cole travels to the future and lands in London in 1954. He does as Absinthe asks him, but Absinthe betrays him and doesn't help Fiona, who succumbs to her disease. Cole feels like his heart is ripped out and decides to give Absinthe a little payback: he takes the Engine and buries it beneath Stonehenge, believing the Engine is as important to Absinthe as Fiona was to him. Absinthe is furious that Cole has hidden the Engine. He rips out Cole's actual heart and all goes dark for Cole. The first issue of Steampunk begins 100 years later: Cole wakes up in a strange coffin during the Victorian Age. His coffin was discovered by two grave-robbers, Randy and Sköm, who are attacked by Dog Soldiers, half man, half beast. Cole attacks the soldiers in a daze and defeats them, then turns on the grave-robbers, but loses consciousness. Randy takes him to safety, hoping to make some money off of Cole. When he wakes up, Cole's memory is a mess, he can recall little of his past and when he looks at himself, he's in shock: his chest is now a metal furnace and his right arm is a gigantic mechanical claw. He is informed that London is now under the rule of Lord Absinthe and has been for the last century. London is unrecognizable: dark smoke obscures the sky and leaky pipes circle ramshackle villages. Poor people are forced to live underground. The aristocracy lives at the upper levels, unaware and uncaring about anything besides themselves. Those with the money and desire can buy animal or mechanical parts to enhance their bodies as they wish. Death and destruction have become entertainment for them. Cole becomes an unwilling inspiration to the Underground Resistance led by Sir Robert Peel, while Absinthe hears of Cole's return and sends his best assassins to capture him: the demonic Faust and Victoria, a woman who would have become Queen Victoria if it had not been for Cole and Absinthe's actions. Characters=Main characters In alphabetical order *Cole Blaquesmith: Former fisherman and prizefighter, Cole fell in love with Fiona, a teacher who taught him to read, write and most importantly to think for himself. When Fiona falls ill, Cole makes a pact with Dr. Absinthe. A pact which ended with Fiona's death, Absinthe in possession of technology 200 years more advanced than anybody else and Cole with his heart ripped out. Cole's heart and right arm are replaced with a furnace and mechanical arm made from steel by the mysterious Dr. Sundown. He wakes up 100 years in the future and becomes the unwilling hero against the rule of Lord Absinthe. Cole suffers from amnesia and can only recall fragments of his past. Cole's metal arm gives him enormous strength as long as the furnace in his heart is fed enough coal. Bellows in his shoulder can be used to breathe. A gun is built into his arm. *Mortimer Absinthe: Doctor Absinthe was a dark and twisted genius, who manipulated a young fisherman into handing him scientific knowledge from the future. Knowledge Absinthe used to conquer all of England. He rules with an iron fist, taking great pleasure in the suffering and death of his underlings. Absinthe is interested in the mysterious Moonkings. Absinthe somehow has extended his life, despite being over 100 years old he's still healthy and vital. He is capable of grafting pieces of animals to other animals and humans and has created most of his army himself. He has also taken over speech patterns from the 1950s (and influenced the rest of England's speech patterns into a slang called \\"Jive\\"). Absinthe is not a coward though and is fully willing to enter combat himself, wearing a special armor that can fire small missiles and carrying a sword. *Faust: Absinthe's assassin, a mysterious, green-skinned being that seems to be unkillable. He pretends to be honorable and yearns for a duel with Cole, but has no problem with stalking and killing innocents. Faust is completely loyal to Absinthe, despite Absinthe toying with him. Faust has a romantic fixation on Victoria and has taken an interest in Laslo, the only man Faust has ever let go from his clutches. Faust seems to be incapable of feeling pain or dying; multiple shots to the chest didn't slow him down. He has amazing agility and speed and carries a sword that glows with heat, which can cut through nearly anything. He also carries a flute on which he plays eerie tunes to scare his victims. *Fiona: Cole's teacher and the love of his life. She died in the 18th century, but somehow she turns up in the 19th century and tries to come into contact with Cole. At the end of Steampunk #12, Fiona finally meets up with Cole and the two share a kiss. Fiona's reappearance and youth 100 years after her demise have been unexplained. *Laslo: A young, black gypsy. Idealistic and brave, Laslo was part of the Resistance against Absinthe when his best friend Rikk was captured by Faust. Laslo took Rikk's scarf, the only thing left and swore vengeance upon Faust. He saw Cole stand up to Absinthe and put his faith in him, only to be disappointed. During the fight between Absinthe and the Resistance, Laslo's faith is renewed and he stands against Faust. Faust defeats him and burns his mark in the back of the young Laslo, then lets him go. This mark worries Victoria, who has called Laslo \\"ucenic al diavol\\" (the devil's student). Laslo indeed starts to hear Faust's tune even when Faust was not around and begins to display Faust's agility and speed and later even his physical characteristics. He and Tini Sundown share a romantic relationship. *Rutherford Nixon: Absinthe's former right-hand man, in fact Nixon was a deeply religious man who hoped to find a way to stop Absinthe. He triggers Cole's memory and Cole decides to fight against Absinthe. To help him, Nixon releases the children of Westminster Abbey, failures of Absinthe's experiments that he took care off. In the ensuing battle, Absinthe sends Faust to kill Nixon. Faust does so, but Nixon manages to give a key and instructions to Laslo, who wishes to honor the dying Nixon. *Sir Robert Peel: Based on Sir Robert Peel. An aristocrat by birth, he cares deeply about the injustice done to the Underdwellers and leads the Resistance against Absinthe. Despite his courage and dedication, most Underdwellers distrust Peel, who as an aristocrat, simply isn't \\"one of them\\". The battle of London changes these feelings and Peel is accepted as their leader. *Sköm: Business partner of Randy, Sköm is a thief, scoundrel and gambler. Unlike Randy who at heart is a good and honest person, Sköm is vain and cares only about himself. He claims to know a lot about Britain's history. He has replaced his right arm with a bird's wing and is very proud of it, constantly worrying that dirt will dirty his feathers. He is saving up for a second wing. Despite his lack of noble motivations, Sköm is useful to Cole and his friends: his skills as a gambler have provided them with money from time to time. *Tini Sundown: Great-great- granddaughter of the legendary Hiram Sundown, Tini takes after her ancestor: she is very smart and has no problem letting other people know that she is. Tini knows a lot about Cole's mechanical arm, having studied the blueprints and she has used Nixon's key to unlock the hidden gun. Tini and Laslo share a romantic relationship. *Victoria of Kent, Queen of Savages: In another age, Victoria would have been Queen Victoria of England. Now she was raised as an assassin, though she knows about her royal heritage. Victoria is a complex person, torn between her nobility and her desire for freedom. Originally sent by Absinthe to capture Cole, Absinthe then changes his mind and sends Faust after her. Victoria feels betrayed and joins up with the Resistance. During the battle she finds out that Faust is romantically interested in her and offers her security against Absinthe's wrath if she joins him. Victoria doesn't return Faust's feelings and fights with Cole. When Faust catches up to him, Victoria tells him that she is playing along with Cole, but she slowly begins to develop a deep love for him. She confesses her love to him, but when he is about to return it, Fiona appears and kisses Cole. Victoria talks to a man named Starlin in her mind, confessing her sins and insecurities to him. Starlin was her confidante (and possibly romantic partner) in her youth until he was killed by Faust. Her main weapons are metallic whips that she can use with deadly accuracy. She also uses a gun. Her hands have been surgically grafted to her arms, their true origin unknown. *'Rabid' Randy Warbuck: Self- proclaimed \\"King of Bushwah (dung)\\". Partner of Sköm, the two robbed graves. Despite this, Randy is basically an honest and caring person. He develops a friendship with Cole, even though the moody Cole often doesn't return it. Randy is part rodent and loves his pet-fish Flint. He also treasures his prized shovel. Minor characters *Batcat: As its name implies half cat, half bat. This creature serves as Absinthe's personal spy. It is capable of recording voices and replaying them to Absinthe. It is far more intelligent than its appearance would lead one to believe. *D. Danforth: A private in Absinthe's army, Danforth is basically just a head on a cybernetic undercarriage. He commands other troops, but, as he is lacking a body, is pretty useless in combat, himself. *Napoleon Bonaparte: Based on the real Napoleon Bonaparte. After a long war between France and Absinthe's Britain, he found that Absinthe had Bonaparte's wife, Josephine, assassinated. Bonaparte gave up his humanity and became a living computer connected to all of France. He now is France, controlling all weapon systems and guiding its soldiers. Bonaparte saw Cole as a kindred spirit, even a brother, and hopes to ally with him until Cole mentions speaking from his heart. Bonaparte floods his chambers, sending Cole and his friends away, while he ponders how Cole can still have feelings while lacking a heart. *The Iron Monk: An agent of the Vatican, the monk is completely dressed in an iron armor and nobody knows what is inside. He still is at least partly human, though—he was pleased with Nixon sending him courtesans to entertain him, and he still bleeds when wounded. Absinthe had told the Vatican that he had figured out a way to directly extract a soul from a body, allowing the Vatican to purify the souls with much more ease. In return, the Vatican would supply Absinthe with the knowledge to reach the mysterious Moonkings. Absinthe's process is a trick though: he has injected radium in the victims pineal glands and the extracted “soul” is simply radioactive fluid. During the Battle of London, Victoria battles the Iron Monk, who wields a large morning star. Despite Victoria putting several bullets through his helmet and even bashing in his head, the Iron Monk later gets up and walks away. *Medik: A brilliant surgeon who works for Absinthe. A kindred spirit to Absinthe, he often confides his plans to Medik. *Pestilent Brothel (22, Miss Hiss and Strap): Absinthe's courtesans, bodyguards, interrogators and warriors in one. 22 is a woman with two faces and four arms (or possibly two women merged into one body). One face is on the back of her head. She carries four guns. Miss Hiss is part cobra and part dove, she possesses the useful ability to look into a person's mind (though it seems to be limited). A shawl hides the lower part of her face and when removed shows that her mouth is filled with needle-shaped teeth. Little is known about Strap, she doesn't speak and her body is completely covered with straps, leaving only her long blond hair free. During the Battle of London, she fights Cole and Victoria and is presumably killed. *Rikk: Friend of Laslo, captured by Faust and killed by Absinthe as a demonstration for the Iron Monk. *Hiram Sundown: Brilliant scientist and designer of Cole's metal arm, a Mechanica Sundown. He also built a cryogenic chamber to keep Cole safe till Absinthe was gone, instead he left Cole in the chamber for 100 years. He probably also was the designer of the time-travel Engine. Little is known about Hiram's relationship with Absinthe and Cole. *Milton Sundown: Grandson of Hiram and grandfather to Tini, Milton is not as brilliant as either, though still a genius. He always appreciates a good Martini. *Mambutu X: Leader of the X, the former black slaves of Britain. Mambutu leads a huge mining operation at Stonehenge, the place where Cole hid the Engine. Mambutu takes a liking to young Laslo and offers to help Cole as long as Cole works for him for a month. It turns out that Mambutu and the X are in fact still slaves, but Absinthe has been using the illusion of freedom so that they would work harder. Mambutu turns on Absinthe, allowing Cole and his friends to escape. Mambutu X has four arms and his eyes have been replaced with large metal screws (that seem to work as mechanical eyes). He usually hides these eyes with dark glasses. Collections *Steampunk: Manimatron () *Steampunk: Drama Obscura ().

The subject of the image was trapped on the upper floors of the North Tower and either fell searching for safety or jumped to escape the fire and smoke. The photograph was taken at 9:41:15 a.m. on the day of the attacks. The photographer has noted that, in at least two cases, newspaper stories commenting on the image have attracted a barrage of criticism from readers who found the image \\"disturbing”.Howe, Peter (2001). \\"Richard Drew\\". The Digital Journalist , January 2010 Background Of the 2,606 victims killed inside the World Trade Center and on the ground in New York City during the September 11 attacks, some have estimated that at least 200 fell or jumped to their deaths, while other estimates put the number at half of that or fewer.Cauchon, Dennis. \\"Desperation forced a horrific decision\\" . USA Today. Officials could not recover or identify the bodies of those forced out of the buildings prior to the collapse of the towers. The New York City medical examiner's office said it does not classify the people who fell to their deaths on September 11 as \\"jumpers\\". According to Ellen Borakove, the examiner's office spokeswoman, \\"A 'jumper' is somebody who goes to the office in the morning knowing that they will commit suicide. These people were forced out by the smoke and flames or blown out.\\" The photograph gives the impression that the man is falling straight down; however, a series of photographs taken of his fall shows him to be tumbling through the air. Publication history The photograph initially appeared in newspapers around the world, including on page 7 of The New York Times on September 12, 2001. The photo's caption read, \\"A person falls headfirst after jumping from the north tower of the World Trade Center. It was a horrific sight that was repeated in the moments after the planes struck the towers.\\" It appeared only once in the Times because of criticism and anger against its use. Six years later, it appeared on page 1 of The New York Times Book Review on May 27, 2007. Identification The identity of the subject of the photograph has never been officially confirmed. The large number of people trapped in the tower has made identifying the man in the 12 photos difficult. After seeing a missing persons poster, reporter Peter Cheney suggested in the Canadian national newspaper The Globe and Mail that the man pictured in the photo may have been Norberto Hernandez, a pastry chef at Windows on the World, a restaurant located on the 106th floor of the North Tower. Some members of Hernandez's family initially agreed with Cheney, but after examining the entire photo sequence and noting details of his clothing, were no longer convinced. Jonathan Eric Briley \\"The Falling Man\\", an article about the photograph by American journalist Tom Junod, was published in the September 2003 issue of Esquire magazine. It was adapted into a documentary film by the same name. The article gave the possible identity of the falling man as Jonathan Briley (March 5, 1958 – September 11, 2001), a 43-year-old sound engineer who worked at Windows on the World. His brother Alex is an original member of the 1970s disco group Village People. Briley had asthma and would have known he was in danger when smoke began to pour into the restaurant. Briley was initially identified by his brother, Timothy. Michael Lomonaco, the restaurant's executive chef, also suggested that the man was Briley based on his body type and clothes. In one of the photos, the Falling Man's shirt or white jacket was blown open and up, revealing an orange t-shirt similar to one shirt that Briley often wore.

The film is loosely based on Junod's Esquire story. It also drew its material from photographer Lyle Owerko's pictures of falling people. It debuted on March 16, 2006, on the British television network Channel 4, later made its North American premiere on Canada's CBC Newsworld on September 6, 2006, and has been broadcast in more than 30 countries. The U.S. premiere was September 10, 2007, on the Discovery Times Channel. The novel Falling Man, by Don DeLillo, is about the September 11 attacks. The \\"falling man\\" in the novel is a performance artist recreating the events of the photograph. DeLillo says he was unfamiliar with the title of the picture when he named his book. The artist straps himself into a harness and jumps from an elevated structure in a high visibility area (such as a highway overpass), hanging in the pose of The Falling Man.

After disbanding in 1998, the group reunited as a mainstream act in 2009 and released their third full- length album entitled Imperium the following year. History Singer/guitarist Pete Stewart, bassist Dalton Roraback and his drummer brother Paul Roraback recorded a self-titled three-song demo tape in 1994. After hearing the demo, ForeFront Records label executive Eddie DeGarmo signed the band. Before releasing their first major album, Grammtrain released a CD containing four studio recordings and five live acoustic numbers. In 1995 they released their first studio album, Lonely House, produced by Aaron Sprinkle. The album achieved success on Christian Radio. Their second full-length album, Flying was released in 1997. Critics cited the album's \\"lighter, more polished feel\\" when compared to Lonely House.http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/Flying.asp Retrieved 7/1/2011 At the end of a tour promoting the album, Grammatrain officially broke up following their final live performance on 12/7/1998 in Germany. An announcement of the breakup can be heard on the band's live album. Following the breakup of the band, Stewart released a self-titled solo album and produced Michael Tait's band, Tait, performing on their first album. He also produced four tracks on the debut solo album for TobyMac, Momentum. In 2003 Stewart reemerged with The Accident Experiment. Reunited In early 2009, Grammatrain announced that they had reunited and were in the process of recording a new album. Because frontman Pete Stewart had left the Christian faith, the new album was not directed at Christian audiences. Shortly after the announcement, the band played two reunion shows: one in Seattle and one in Germany. A limited edition EP with songs from the forthcoming album was released at the shows and on the band's website. In 2010, the single \\"The Last Sound\\" was released, the video was debuted at a Seattle Sounders FC match. The song has been played at Qwest Field before the kickoff of Sounders matches, and Sounders FC owner Drew Carey endorsed the song and promised to get a \\"proper video\\" made of it. The video was produced and directed by Nik Venet, who had previously done videos for U2, Jane's Addiction and The White Stripes. The song was also picked up by and released through Rock Band Network for the Xbox 360. On October 10, 2010 (10.10.10), they independently released their newest album, Imperium.

The added spatial dimension allows a color solid to depict an added dimension of color variation. Whereas a two- dimensional color wheel typically depicts the variables of hue (red, green, blue, etc.) and lightness (gradations of light and dark, tints or shades), a color solid adds the variable of colorfulness (either chroma or saturation), allowing the solid to depict all conceivable colors in an organized three- dimensional structure. Organization Different color theorists have each designed unique color solids. Many are in the shape of a sphere, whereas others are warped three-dimensional ellipsoid figures--these variations being designed to express some aspect of the relationship of the colors more clearly. The color spheres conceived by Phillip Otto Runge and Johannes Itten are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics.Johannes Itten, \\"The Art of Color\\", 1961. Trans. Ernst Van Haagen. New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1966. . Pure, saturated hues of equal brightness are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere. As in the color wheel, contrasting (or complementary) hues are located opposite each other. Moving toward the center of the color sphere on the equatorial plane, colors become less and less saturated, until all colors meet at the central axis as a neutral gray. Moving vertically in the color sphere, colors become lighter (toward the top) and darker (toward the bottom). At the upper pole, all hues meet in white; at the bottom pole, all hues meet in black. The vertical axis of the color sphere, then, is gray all along its length, varying from black at the bottom to white at the top. All pure (saturated) hues are located on the surface of the sphere, varying from light to dark down the color sphere. All impure (unsaturated hues, created by mixing contrasting colors) comprise the sphere's interior, likewise varying in brightness from top to bottom.  Usage  Artists and art critics find the color solid to be a useful means of organizing the three variables of color-- hue, lightness, and saturation (or chroma), as modelled in the HCL and HSL color models--in a single schematic, using it as an aid in the composition and analysis of visual art.  Differences  File:Sphere vertical cross section runge.svg  Philipp Otto Runge's Farbenkugel File:Sphere vertical cross section munsell.svg  Albert Henry Munsell's color sphere File:Sphere vertical cross section itten.svg  Johannes Itten's color sphere File:Sphere vertical cross section parametric.svg  Spherical coordinate system (for comparison) Despite the general description given earlier, historically, different authors have structured their shapes differently, internally. For instance, among the spherical color solids, \\"colorfulness\\" (or \\"chroma\\" or \\"saturation\\", depending) may increase or decrease horizontally from a central axis (Munsell and Itten, above), or may increase outwardly in every direction from a central point (Runge, also above). Further, definitions for \\"chroma\\", \\"colorfulness\\", \\"saturation\\", etc. vary between color models. For instance, in the Munsell and HSV systems, dark colors can have a full range of different \\"saturations\\", whereas light colors always have a low \\"saturation\\". In the HSL system, both a very light color and a very dark color may be equally \\"saturated\\". (Other systems differ in other ways.) Lastly, if colors are meant to be kept perceptually uniform, then a perfectly regular shape such as a sphere, cylinder or cone is not possible. Rather, models aiming for perceptual uniformity tend to be highly irregular in shape. Compare, for instance, Albert Munsell's earlier color sphere with his later color tree; or, compare any of the above systems with CIELAB or CIELUV.

Located on Highway 60 north of Jerusalem and Ramallah, it is organised as a community settlement and falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. It was named after the biblical high-priest who served in the Tabernacle in nearby biblical Shiloh (1 Samuel 1:9). In it had a population of . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History Eli- named for the Jacobist prophet, Eli the Prophet- was established on 11 September 1984, when three families moved into recently placed buildings. It was the first settlement to be attempted without a core group of families. Several families from Ofra, Kokhav HaShahar, and Shilo were persuaded to come for at least a year while more families would be found. The settlement was originally called 'Givat Levona' after the adjacent settlement Ma'ale Levona. The Amana website states that the initial vision was creating 'one long territorial contiguity' of Jewish settlers between Eli and both Shiloh and Ma'ale Levona. According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from two nearby Palestinian villages in order to construct Eli: 1,551 dunums from As- Sawiya As Sawiya Village Profile, ARIJ, pp. 16-17 and 623 dunums from Qaryut. Qaryut Village profile (including Jalud Locality), ARIJ, p. 17 In recent years the town has evolved into the municipal center for the Shilo area settlement bloc. Eli is also home to the Bnei David pre-military Mechina academy. This yeshiva also offers post-army academic programs. Bnei David Academy President of Israel Reuven Rivlin in mechina Bnei David Yigal Levinstein Bnei David is the first pre-military Orthodox Mechina academy (1988), and was founded by rabbis Eli Sadan and Yig'al Levinstein. Many of the graduates have reached high rank in the IDF. It is an integral part of Eli, as many of the rabbis, administrators, graduates, and students live in Eli. There are currently over 500 students studying at Bnei David, and over 2,500 graduates, over 40% of them became officers, and the majority served in combatant or elite units. Shimon Peres has called it \\"Pride for the country\\".פרס על המכינה הדתית בעלי: \\"גאווה למדינה\\" Co-founder of the academy, Rabbi Yigal Levinstein, went on record in 2016 claiming gay people were 'sick and perverted' and that drafting women into the IDF deprived them of their Jewishness. In 2018 Rabbi Yosef Kelner asserted that women had feeble minds and a reduced spirituality. In April 2019, the head of the school, Rabbi Eliezer Kashtiel, was filmed lecturing to students on the genetic inferiority of gentiles, Palestinians, on their stupidity, and the need for them to be enslaved. He endorsed racism, and the superiority of the Jewish people. In another lecture, Rabbi Giora Redler stated the Holocaust was a divine punishment to make Jews leave the diaspora, that Hitler was correct 'in every word he said… he was just on the wrong side,' that humanism was the real holocaust, not Hitler's murdering of Jews.Tamar Pileggi, Embracing racism, rabbis at pre-army yeshiva laud Hitler, urge enslaving Arabs The Times of Israel 30 April 2019Jonathan Ofir, 'Israeli rabbis at military prep school are caught on video praising Hitler,' Mondoweiss 30 April 2019Maariv Online, 'Rabbis say ‘Hitler was right, pluralism the true Holocaust,’ Jerusalem Post 30 April 2019 Graduates of Bnei David who died during their IDF service include Roi Klein, Emmanuel Moreno, and Amihai Merhavia. Expansion plans  In 2013, the Israeli Civil Administration published a master plan (no. 237) which, if approved, would legitimize hundreds of the structures in Eli and incorporate Eli's four outposts, from the land of Palestinian villages As-Sawiye and Al-Lubban ash- Sharqiya, and Quaryut. It covers 1,000 dunams, but would allow the expansion of other outposts to embrace 6,000 dunams, including privately owned Palestinian land. Within the plan's map, there are 7 Palestinian enclaves, where Palestinians may carry out agricultural projects, but are denied the right to build. The plan depends on declaring collectively owned Palestinian village lands in question as ownerless under Ottoman law, a classification which allows them to be defined as \\"state property\\" reserved for Jews alone.Amira Hass, 'Plan to legalize West Bank settlement of Eli paves way for its expansion,' at Haaretz, 1 June 2013. Israeli-Palestinian conflict In 2013, representatives of the nearby Palestinian village of Krayot blamed Eli settlers for an alleged uprooting of more than 100 olive trees on their property.Jack Khoury, 'More than 100 olive trees uprooted in West Bank, Palestinians report,' at [Haaretz] Oct. 19, 2013. In January 2014, an Eli resident claimed to have photographed Palestinians chopping down an olive tree which a later report on Ma'an news blamed 'settlers' for the incident. In August 2015, a gas station was firebombed on Route 60 near Eli. Later, two Palestinian from Awarta, members of PFLP claimed the attack was a retaliation for the firebombing at Duma.Raoul Wootliff, 'Two held for firebomb attack on settlement gas station,' The Times of Israel29 September 2015.

The species is endemic to the central region of the American state of Texas, and south into adjacent northern Mexico. Description The Texas alligator lizard is a medium-sized lizard, attaining a maximum total length (including tail) of around . It is the largest lizard species in Texas, and one of the largest alligator lizards in the world. This lizard has a flat, wedge-shaped head. Its body is generally a yellow-brown color, often with darker brown and white checker patterning on its dorsal surfaces, and uniformly light-colored, white, or grey on its ventral surfaces. Its scales are very stiff and plate-like. It has short limbs, and a tail that can fall off to distract a potential predator, but will regrow in time. Behavior The Texas alligator lizard is a relatively slow, diurnal lizard, with quite good vision. Though not generally aggressive, it may bite if handled, and is incorrectly considered to be venomous by many cultures. Habitat G. infernalis is often found on rocky hillsides, where it hides among the stones or in limestone crevices. Diet The primary diet of G. infernalis is insects and other invertebrates, but it may sometimes prey on nestling birds or rodents.Clif Blocks Reproduction Breeding occurs year-round; sometimes, multiple clutches of eggs are laid per year. Females will often stay near the nesting site to protect it, but no parental care occurs once the young alligator lizards hatch. The young generally have more striking markings, and are only about long (including tail).

She took her first state law examination in 1977 and her second state law examination in 1979. In 1982 she received a doctorate in the field of law. She worked as a trainee lawyer from 1977 to 1979 and as a civil servant of the Free State of Bavaria from 1979 to 1987, and in 1990. From 1987 to 1990 she was an official of the foreign service of the Federal Republic of Germany.

She is also a lecturer at the University of Regensburg. In 1999, Gabriele Stauner became a member of the 5th European Parliament. During this time, she served on the Committee on Budgetary Control and the delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee. In her capacity as member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, she drafted the committee's report on granting budget discharge for 1998 and 2002.Stauner’s return has Commission running for cover European Voice, December 14, 2005.

She also was a substitute for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, and the delegation to the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee. In October 2013, Stauner returned to the European Parliament to take over from Anja Weisgerber who was elected to the German Bundestag.Return of the super-sub European Voice, October 16, 2013. Controversies In 2001, Stauner issued a statement through her office, saying she thought it was “ridiculous” that details of her financial interests should be put on the European Parliament's website. At the time, Swedish MEP Cecilia Malmström said: “It’s astonishing that [Stauner] is known for calling for more transparency, and has criticised the Commission a lot because of its lack of transparency. She should be setting a good example.”John Shelley (July 11, 2001), Anti-secrecy MEPs snub transparency European Voice. During the Azerbaijani presidential elections in 2013, Stauner participated in an election monitoring delegation funded by the Berlin-based Society for the Promotion of German-Azerbaijani Relations (GEFDAB); the organization is registered as a private company. The resulting report on Azerbaijan's presidential election was subsequently criticized as markedly kinder than the verdict of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

The social goals of the plans were improving health and education as well as encouraging equitable income distribution. Although each plan had different development priorities, the allocation of resources did not always reflect these priorities. The first four plans concentrated on infrastructure—to make it possible to facilitate the movement of goods and services—and to increase the size of the market. Each of the five-year plans depended heavily on foreign assistance in the forms of grants and loans. First Five-Year Plan The First Five-Year Plan(1956–61) allocated Rs330 million for development expenditures of which Rs220 million were funded by international donors, partly under the Colombo Plan.https://www.npc.gov.np/images/category/FirrstPlan_Eng.pdf Transportation received top priority with almost 30% of the budget allocation but rural development, including agriculture, village development, irrigation and forestry also received significant amounts. Second After Parliament, which had been established under the 1959 constitution, was suspended in 1960, the Second Plan failed to materialize on schedule. A new plan was not introduced until 1962 and covered only three years, 1962-65. The Second Plan had expenditures of almost Rs615 million. Transportation and communication again received top priority with about 39 percent of budget expenditures. Industry, tourism, and social services were the second priority. Although targets again were missed, there were improvements in industrial production, road construction, telephone installations, irrigation, and education. However, only the organizational improvement area of the target was met. The first two plans were developed with very little research and a minimal data base. Neither plan was detailed, and both contained only general terms. The administrative machinery with which to execute these plans also was inadequate. The National Planning Commission, which formulated the second plan, noted the difficulty of preparing plans in the absence of statistical data. Further, as was the case with the first plan, the bulk of the development budget depended on foreign aid—mostly in the form of grants. The failure of these plans was indicated by the government's inability to spend the budgeted amounts. Third The Third Five-Year Plan(1965–70) increased the involvement of local panchayat. It also focused on transport, communications, foreign trade and industrial and agricultural development. Total planned expenditures were more than Rs1.6 billion. Its objective was also to make fair society ty by eliminating the social disparities. Fourth The Fourth Five-Year Plan(1970–75) increased proposed expenditures to more than Rs3.3 billion. Transportation and communications again were the top priority, receiving 41.2 percent of expenditures, followed by agriculture, which was allocated 26 percent of the budget. Although the third and fourth plans increased the involvement of the panchayat in the development process, the central government continued to carry most of the responsibilities. Fifth The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1975–80) proposed expenditures of more than Rs8.8 billion. For the first time, the problem of poverty was addressed in a five-year plan, although no specific goals were mentioned. Top priority was given to agricultural development, and emphasis was placed on increasing food production and cash crops such as sugar cane and tobacco. Increased industrial production and social services also were targeted. Controlling population growth was considered a priority. Sixth The Sixth Five-Year Plan(1980–85) proposed an outlay of more than Rs 22 billion. Agriculture remained the top priority; increased social services were second. The budget share allocated to transportation and communication was less than that allocated in the previous plan; it was felt that the transportation network had reached a point where it was more beneficial to increase spending on agriculture and industry. Seventh The Seventh Five-Year Plan(1985–90) proposed expenditures of Rs29 billion. It encouraged private sector participation in the economy (less than Rs22 billion) and local government participation (Rs2 billion). The plan targeted increasing productivity of all sectors, expanding opportunity for productive employment, and fulfilling the minimum basic needs of the people. For the first time since the plans were devised, specific goals were set for meeting basic needs. The availability of food, clothing, fuelwood, drinking water, primary health care, sanitation, primary and skillbased education, and minimum rural transport facilities was emphasized. Because of the political upheavals in mid-1990, the new government postponed formulating the next plan. The July 1990 budget speech of the minister of finance, however, implied that for the interim, the goals of the seventh plan were being followed. Foreign aid as a percentage of development averaged around 66 percent (see table 10, Appendix). The government continually failed to use all committed foreign aid, however, probably as a result of inefficiency. In the Rs26.6 billion budget presented in July 1991, approximately Rs11.8 billion, or 44.4 percent of the budget, was expected to be derived from foreign loans or grants. Eighth The Eighth Plan(1992-1997) is the first plan of the democratic government formed through popular elections following the restoration of democracy brought about by the historic people's movement of 1990. In this context, the perspectives of this plan are based on two principal contradictory factors. These factors consist of, on the one hand, the positive aspects of the new aspirations and enthusiasm among the general public and, on the other, the negative aspects of the legacy of economic depravity left behind by the panchayat regime. Ninth Ninth Year Plan(1997-2002) The main objectives of Ninth plan was poverty alleviation. The target of the ninth plan was to increase industrial production by 6% per annum the investment both domestic and foreign was estimated to be Rs. 35 billion. The plan also estimated creation of additional 0.35 million jobs. Industrial contribution to the GDP was expected to reach 14% by the end of the plan period. Many of these targets could not be achieved during the plan period. Tenth Tenth Year Plan(2002-2007) Tenth plan also has given priority to poverty alleviation. To achieve the objective the plan has targeted to improve the economic, human and social indicators. The plan also aims to strengthen the capability of the private sector and encourage it to participate in social development activities. References \\\\- Nepal, information is from 1991.

It was decisive as it thwarted the rebels' last chance to regain the initiative and recapture the cities of Kanpur (Cawnpore) and Lucknow. Background During the 1857 uprising against the East India Company, Kanpur (then spelled Cawnpore) had fallen to the rebel leader Nana Sahib. The Company forces led by Major General Henry Havelock recaptured the town on 17 July 1857. Soon after he arrived at Cawnpore, Havelock received news that Henry Lawrence, the British Resident in Awadh (referred to at the time as Oudh) had died, and that the Company forces were besieged and facing a defeat at Lucknow. Havelock decided to attempt to relieve Lucknow. He fought against the rebel forces blocking his way, winning victories at Unnao (or Unao) and Bashiratganj (or Bashiratgunj), though at a high cost in casualties. However, he was soon informed that the Gwalior army had also rebelled against Company rule. Havelock realized that his forces were not strong enough to fight their way to Lucknow, and returned to Cawnpore on 13 August to await reinforcements. Once reinforced, the British forces began constructing a bridge over the Ganges River, but the rebel soldiers attacked the bridge from the northern bank. Havelock sent Brasyer's Sikhs regiment to cover the construction. The Sikh regiment forced the rebel soldiers to retreat, and the bridge was completed without further interference. The reinforced British army under Havelock and Lieutenant General Sir James Outram then set out for Lucknow. They were able to enter the city, but became besieged themselves. Another, larger, force under General Colin Campbell, the new Commander-in-Chief, India, gathered in Cawnpore to make a second relief of Lucknow. While he led his main force to Lucknow, Campbell left a detachment of about 1,500 men under Brigadier Charles Ash Windham to hold Cawnpore, the vital bridge of boats across the Ganges, and the entrenchment constructed to protect it. Windham had a reputation for bravery gained in the Crimean War, and was nicknamed \\"Redan\\" Windham, after a Russian fortification at Sevastopol. Meanwhile, the Nana Sahib's lieutenant, Tantya Tope, had gathered an army to recapture Cawnpore. The core of this army was the Gwalior Contingent. This was a body of troops in the service of the ruler of Gwalior, but which was recruited and organised on the same lines as the Bengal Presidency Army of the East India Company. The Gwalior Contingent had mutinied against their British officers in June and July. They had since remained undecided as to their next course of action until Tantya Tope took charge of them, and led them to Kalpi on 9 November, where they crossed the Jumna River and moved east on Cawnpore. Tantya Tope recaptures Cawnpore By 19 November, Tantya Tope's advance guard of 6,000 dominated all the routes west and north-west of Cawnpore. Although Windham was aware that Campbell had gained success at Lucknow, he nevertheless decided not to wait for Campbell's force to return from Lucknow, but to attack Tantya Tope before he could threaten the entrenchment. On 26 November, Windham's force drove back Tantya Tope's advance guard. However, the rebels' main body was close at hand. Windham tried to make an orderly withdrawal but some of his troops (a battalion made up of a mixed bag of detachments of several regiments) misbehaved, retreating without orders and looting drink and supplies when they reached the entrenchment. Meanwhile, Campbell was withdrawing from Lucknow with 3,000 troops and a convoy containing 2,000 sick, wounded and non- combatants who had been evacuated from Lucknow. Hearing that Cawnpore was in danger, he left his infantry to protect the convoy and moved ahead with his cavalry and horse artillery. To his relief, when he arrived on the north bank of the Ganges late on 27 November, the bridge was still intact. Windham held the entrenchment, but the Tantya Tope's army had occupied the city of Cawnpore and the ground between the city and the Ganges. Evacuation of civilians Campbell crossed the bridge the next day. He deployed his artillery on the north bank of the river to fire on the rebels threatening the bridge, and then slowly filed the carts and other vehicles of the convoy across the bridge. The process took three days to complete. Although several officers urged Campbell to attack as soon as the north bank was evacuated, Campbell delayed for another five days while all the non-combatants were ferried down-river to safety. Campbell was later to be known for his caution and deliberation, becoming irreverently known as \\"Sir Crawling Camel\\". Tantya Tope defeated The rebels had continued to make some attacks on the British positions. An attack on 5 December was beaten off. Campbell was now ready to make his own attack, having received 5,600 reinforcements with 35 guns.Hibbert (1980), p. 353 On 6 December, Windham opened a violent bombardment from the entrenchment to deceive the rebels that Campbell was about to attack their left. The real attack was made on their right, curling around the city of Cawnpore to threaten the rebels' links to Kalpiii. Campbell's artillery, which included many guns that were heavier than those possessed by the rebels, particularly the 24-pounders manned by the sailors of the Naval Brigade, was the decisive factor. As the Gwalior Contingent broke and fled, the Nana Sahib's own retainers and adherents were defeated north of the city. The pursuit by Campbell's cavalry was pressed as hard as possible, capturing almost every gun and cart from the rebels. At Bithoor, the Nana Sahib's treasury was captured the next day, concealed in a well. Results The rebels had attacked Cawnpore at the most favourable possible moment, under one of their most dynamic and charismatic leaders, and yet they had been defeated. From this point on, increasing numbers of British reinforcements were to arrive in India and the rebellion was doomed to defeat, although Tantya Tope and other determined leaders continued to resist for more than a year.

Biography=Early life Falzon grew up in the beachside suburb of Maroubra in Sydney, Australia. He did not begin surfing until the age of 14, when the Falzon family moved to the New South Wales Central Coast. He currently resides in Eungai, New South Wales Filmmaking Falzon has always appreciated the power of music in his films and directed Morning of the Earth (1972), an influential surf film. The film portrays surfers living in spiritual harmony with nature, making their own boards and homes as they travel in search of the perfect wave across Australia's north-east coast, Bali and Hawaii. Falzon's inaugural feature film was the first Australian film to receive a \\"gold record\\" for soundtrack album sales. A passion for travel, particularly to remote and spectacular regions of the world, has been a major influence on the themes of Falzon's work. A six- part documentary series focused on traditional festivals in Far Eastern countries, such as Sri Lanka, India, Burma, Ladakh and Tibet, and has been sold in over eighty countries worldwide. And not all locations were easily accessible. The journey through Tibet to the mystical mountain of Kailas was an arduous two weeks in sub zero temperatures, there the film crew recorded for the very first time the sacred Wesak Festival. In 1982, Falzon directed \\"Khumba Mela (same as it ever was)\\", a 90-minute piece filmed in the waterways of Kashmir in India about a Saddhu's pilgrimage. He approached Brian Eno in London about using some of his music as part of the soundtrack. After viewing the film Eno commented that he'd \\"never seen a film that was more suited as a vehicle for his work\\". Brian Eno and Harold Budd are both in the soundtrack, along with music from Pink Floyd and Talking Heads. He entered this film into the Cannes Film Festival with the title \\"Crystal Voyager\\". Another film \\"The Road to Timbuktu\\" followed a path from Casablanca across the searing Sahara Desert to Timbuktu. Falzon's twelve part series \\"Festivals of the World\\" has sold to over eighty countries. He has also directed two long version music videos for Chris Blackwell founder of Island Records and was DOP on \\"Women of Spirit\\" a one-hour television program filmed in India, NY and London. He has written a series of children's programs and has completed a screenplay for a feature film, tentatively titled The Dreamtime. He recently filmed two surfing programs and co-produced a one-hour program on Nicholas Roerich a Russian artist who painted extraordinarily beautiful spiritual painting of The Himalayas at the beginning of the twentieth century. GLOBUS—The Meaning of Light is a recently completed film collaboration with Jeff Hornbaker. Photography and publishing Falzon's career in filmmaking was a natural progression from international still photography, and later combined with magazine publishing, in Australia, Israel and the island of Bali in Indonesia. In 1970, he was co-founder and publisher of the surfing newspaper Tracks, with David Elfick and John Witzig. He is presently working on three books: * Essence, a pictorial on flowers and exotic images from his world travels * Surf Art, a portfolio on the work of ten world-renowned surf photographers * Journey to The Wesak Valley, a diary of his travels to the sacred Wesak Valley, near Mount Kailash in Western Tibet  References  * Sean Doherty, MP: The Life of Michael Peterson, Harper Collins, 2004, . *Australian Surfing Hall of Fame Awards 2006 press release, Surfing Australia, 9 March 2006  External links  * * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Australian film directors Category:Australian people of Maltese descent Category:Australian photographers Category:Australian publishers (people) Category:Australian surfers ","title":"Alby Falzon"},{"id":"4416386","text":"William Rarità (March 21, 1907 – July 8, 1999)Obituary notice from Lawrence Berkeley Lab was an American theoretical physicist who mainly worked on nuclear physics, particle physics and relativistic quantum mechanics.

It was founded in 1936 by John H. Sengstacke, owner of the Chicago Defender. Together with the Defender and a handful of other African-American newspapers, it is owned by Detroit-based Real Times Inc. Its headquarters are in the Real Times offices in Midtown Detroit.\\"Contact Us.\\" (Archive) Real Times Media. Retrieved on December 11, 2013. \\"Real Times Media 479 Ledyard Detroit, MI 48201\\" and \\"Michigan Chronicle 479 Ledyard Detroit, MI 48201\\"  Early history  The Chronicle first editor was Louis E. Martin, whom Sengstacke sent to Detroit on June 6, giving him a $5.00 raise above his $15-per-week salary at the Chicago Defender, $10 in cash and a one-way bus ticket. The Chronicle's first issue had a circulation of 5,000 copies. In 1944, long-time publisher Longworth Quinn joined Martin at the Chronicle. Quinn became a leader in Detroit's African-American business and church groups, and those groups supported the Chronicle. The Chronicle garnered national attention in its early years for its \\"radical\\" approach to politics -- advocacy of organized labor and the Democratic Party. Albert Dunmore, who edited the Detroit edition of the Pittsburgh Courier in the 1940s, remarked in 2010 that most African-American newspapers of the time took the opposite stance, because of \\"the anti-Black attitude prevalent in the organized labor ranks and the heavily southern influence in the Democratic Party\\". James Ingram of the Michigan Chronicle was one of several negotiators involved in the Attica Prison Riots in September 1971. In 2001, Detroit City Council member Kay Everett credited the Michigan Chronicle with having played a key role in local civil rights struggles of the 20th century, such as supporting the election of Mayor Coleman A. Young and, especially, reporting on violence against African-Americans: \\"It was a lone voice in the wilderness when police brutality against African Americans was commonplace\\", Everett wrote. \\"Its coverage of STRESS, the Detroit Police Department's controversial undercover unit, should have won the paper a Pulitzer Prize. During STRESS's four-year run, White STRESS officers shot and killed 23 young Black men. Most shot in the back. The Michigan Chronicle was the only newspaper in the city that told the truth about the killings.\\" Originally located at 1727 St. Antoine Street, the Michigan Chronicle is now located at 479 Ledyard Street.  New owners  Sengstacke Enterprises Inc., publisher of the Chronicle and the daily Defender, would later also include the New Pittsburgh Courier and the Tri- State Defender in Tennessee. When Sengstacke died in 1997, the Chronicle was described as his most profitable newspaper, \\"fat with local and national advertising\\", with a weekly circulation of 43,582. Inheritance tax bills and provisions in Sengstacke's will made it likely that the chain would be sold, but it was administered by a trust in the interim. Amid the uncertainty over the Chronicle ownership, longtime publisher Sam Logan left the paper in 2000 and in May of that year formed a competing weekly, The Michigan FrontPage, which he envisioned as \\"a weekend read\\", published on Fridays. The Chronicle and its sister papers were finally sold in 2003, to Real Times Inc., a group of African-American business leaders from Chicago and Detroit. Logan returned as publisher of both the Chronicle and the FrontPage, which became part of the group. Logan died in late December 2011. Hiram Jackson, president of Real Times Inc., was appointed interim publisher in his place.

Catarina had three children, one eight months old, who was with her when she was shot. The historic tragedy of Catarina came to personify the resistance movement against the regime of Salazar. She was adopted as an icon by the Portuguese Communist Party in Alentejo. Poets Sophia de Mello Breyner, Carlos Aboim Inglez, Eduardo Valente da Fonseca, Francisco Miguel Duarte, José Carlos Ary dos Santos, Maria Luísa Vilão Palma and António Vicente Campinas have all dedicated poems to her. António Vicente Campinas' \\"Cantar Alentejano\\" was put to music by Zeca Afonso on the album \\"Cantigas de Maio\\", made on Christmas day, 1971. (Hear part of the song here.) Context Alentejo was a region of large estates and seasonal jobs and the living conditions of the peasants and salaried workers were extremely difficult. This socio-economic and labor situation agitated the peasant masses in the region starting in the mid-1940s, and this social agitation escalated over the next two decades. There were constant uproars and rural workers' strikes, which were watched by the Portuguese police, who were looking for communist agitators and infiltrators. Death=Murder On May 19, 1954, during the wheat harvest, Catarina and thirteen other harvest- women complained with the supervisor of the property where they were, trying to obtain a two escudo increase in their daily pay. The fourteen women frightened the supervisor enough for him to go to Beja to call the owner and the police. Catarina was chosen to present the worker's grievances to the police. In response to a question of a police lieutenant, Catarina answered that they only wanted \\"work and bread\\". The lieutenant slapped her and she fell to the ground. When Catarina stood up, she said: \\"Now kill me already.\\" The lieutenant shot her three times, shattering her vertebrae. The eight- month-old boy she had in her arms was injured, along with another peasant. Catarina died a few minutes later in the hands of her own boss (who had arrived in the meantime.) He lifted her out of the pool of blood she lay in. Funeral and burial After the funeral, fearing the reaction of the populace, the authorities resolved to carry out Catarina's funeral secretly. When the commoners found out about the funeral, they ran towards the coffin with screams of protest. The police beat them back brutally. The coffin was hastily removed and taken not to the cemetery of Baleizão, but to the land of Catarina's husband António Joaquim, Quintos, about 10 km outside of Baleizão. In 1974, her remains were transferred to Baleizão. In the sequence of disturbances during the funeral, nine peasants were accused of disrespecting authority; the majority of them were sentenced to two years in prison. Lieutenant Carrajola was transferred to Aljustrel but he never came to be judged in court. He died in 1964. Legend=Communist Party affiliations While she has been made into an icon of the anti-fascist resistance, the Portuguese Communist Party supposedly adulterated details of the life and death of Catarina Eufémia. Firstly, they claim that Catarina was a militant of the Communist Party in the local committee of Baleizão in 1953, which some people claim to be false. The choice of Catarina as a spokeswoman for the harvest-women may actually have been influenced by there not being any suspicion of her being a communist. In fact, Mariana Janeiro, a militant communist imprisoned several times by the Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado, always rejected the hypothesis that Catarina was a member of the party. On the other hand, António Gervásio, former leader of the PCP in Alentejo, affirms that Catarina was in fact a member of the local committee of the PCP of Baleizão in 1953. Pregnancy It has also been said that Catarina Eufémia was a few months pregnant when she was killed. Apparently, this information came from other harvest-women, whom Catarina had confided in a few days before her death. During the autopsy, the people of Baleizão were joined in the square of the Cathedral of Beja, a few meters from the Hospital da Misericórdia, crying out in despair: \\"It was not one, there were two deaths!\\" However, the forensic scientist who did the autopsy, Henriques Pinheiro, affirmed repeatedly, even after the revolution of 1974, that the references to a pregnancy were false.

The dark and icy body belongs to the class of centaurs and measures approximately 75 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 27 February 1995, by English astronomer David C. Jewitt and Vietnamese American astronomer Jane Luu at the U.S. Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii, and later named after the mythological creature Hylonome.  Classification and orbit  Centaurs are a large population of icy bodies in transition between trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), their orbits being unstable due to perturbations by the giant planets. Currently, Uranus controls Hylonomes perihelion and Neptune its aphelion. Hylonome is a carbonaceous C-type body that orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 18.9–31.4 AU once every 126 years and 2 months (46,073 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.25 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. It is a Neptune- crosser, and an outer-grazer of the orbit of Uranus, which it hence does not cross. Its minimum orbital intersection distance with Neptune and Uranus is 0.35854 and 0.52875 AU, respectively. It is estimated to have a relatively long orbital half-life of about 6.37 million years. In the year 3478, it will pass within approximately 85 gigameters of Uranus and its semi-major axis will be reduced from 25.1 to 23.5 AU.  Physical characteristics  Observations with the infrared Spitzer Space Telescope indicate a diameter of kilometers, whereas the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous bodies of 0.057, giving it a diameter of 75.1 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 9.35. A study in 2014, using data from Spitzers Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) and Herschels Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer, gave a low albedo and a diameter of kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of . The study concluded that among the observed population of centaurs, there is no correlation between their sizes, albedos, and orbital parameters. However, the smaller the centaur, the more reddish it is.  Naming  This minor planet was named for Hylonome, a female centaur in Greek mythology. In the epic tragedy, she lost her very much beloved husband, the handsome centaur Cyllarus, who was accidentally killed by a spear. Heartbroken, she then took her own life to join him by throwing herself on the spear. The official naming citation was published on 26 July 2000 ().

Conservation Raft Cove contains features characteristic of the Nahwitti Lowland Landscape such as rounded hills, poorly drained areas, rugged coastline and western hemlock and western red cedar forests. Other park features include a river estuary and a long spit and crescent-shaped sandy beach. Raft Cove is home to a significant population of black bears, who forage along the creek beds and beach in the park. Wolves, cougars, black- tailed deer, raccoons, river otters, red squirrels, and a variety of bird species can also be found in the area. Recreation The following recreational activities are available: backcountry camping, hiking, swimming, and board-surfing in the heavy surf. The ocean currents are too rough for windsurfing opportunities, but board-surfing at Raft Cove is becoming increasingly popular with surfers trying to find new surfing challenges and opportunities. The remoteness of this park, along with good waves, makes it a great, uncrowded place to surf.

Located at the east end of the town, the 347-hectare park features a two-kilometre long stretch of sandy beach, a stand of old-growth Douglas fir trees and 174 vehicle-accessible and 25 walk-in camping spaces.http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/rathtrevor/ Popular year-round, the park is easily accessible from Highway 19. The sandy beach is the main attraction. At low tide, it stretches nearly a kilometre out into the Strait of Georgia. Wildlife The park is an important stopover area for migratory birds, notably brant geese, which use the beach as a staging area from March 1 to April 15.http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/rathtrevor/#Nature Origin of the name Rathtrevor takes its name from the Rath family who homesteaded on the land in the late 19th century. The family eventually established a private campground on the site, adding the \\"trevor\\" to give it a more romantic name. In 1967, the campground became a provincial park. Establishment of the park Rathtrevor Beach Park has a connection to Wells Gray Provincial Park in central British Columbia, Canada. In the 1960s, Clearwater Timber Products, a major employer in Clearwater, just outside Wells Gray Park, was running out of timber to supply the mill. On October 3, 1963, the Social Credit Government passed an order-in-council which stated the terms of an agreement between the government and Clearwater Timber whereby the government received 47 hectares of Rathtrevor Beach, owned by Clearwater Timber Products, in exchange for timber rights in 137 square km of southwestern Wells Gray Park. The beach property was valued at $186,000, so the approved swap allowed for that value of timber to be removed from Wells Gray Park. However, the stumpage fee was fixed at $1.50 per 100 cubic feet for fir, an extremely low price because the standard rate paid by a logging company to the government was $16.90.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . An investigation of the deal in 1964 disclosed that the Rath family actually sold their property to Clearwater Timber Products in 1963 for only $150,000, yet within a month the government appraised the property at $186,000. An editorial in the Victoria Daily Times on March 24, 1964, pointed out that “the amount allocated by the government as the value of bargain-priced timber was equivalent to the highest appraisal made on the Rathtrevor property”. Despite the suspicions raised by this investigation, the government granted an additional 65 square km of timber rights to Clearwater Timber in 1964, so its holdings now extended from north of the Flourmill Volcanoes to Mahood Lake. On April 1, 1969, Bob Williams (a Member of the Legislative Assembly or M.L.A.) told the Legislature, \\"It seems questionable that a licence should be granted for the company to run at will through Wells Gray Park at bargain basement prices.\\" Former Kamloops M.L.A., Phil Gaglardi, was accused of using his position as Highways Minister to interfere with the Department of Recreation and Conservation in the land swap and thus secure approval for the deal. Williams summarized the loss to the government by pointing out that 204,000 cubic metres (7.2 million cubic feet) of timber had already been cut, yielding $88,000 in stumpage fees applied to the Rathtrevor purchase. The logging company was nearly halfway through the deal in 1969. Up to that year, the government could have collected a total of $670,613 on stumpage fees, or $l.6 million if the deal had been completed, instead of the $186,000 park site it did acquire. Williams called the arrangement “a glaring example of park mismanagement mixed with outside interference. What we are looking at is between 50 and 60 Stanley Parks. What British Columbia, the public, is being left with is stumps.” By 1974, two years after the New Democratic Party had formed the government, the arrangement with Clearwater Timber was cancelled and the access road to the Flourmill Volcanoes logging area was permanently closed by demolishing the Mahood River bridge. In the 40 years since, Rathtrevor Beach has become one of British Columbia's most popular provincial campgrounds.

The notation  Tongan music from the pre-European times was not really music in the current sense but rather a non tonic recital (like the 'pater noster'), a style still known nowadays as the tau fakaniua. Therefore, when the missionaries started to teach singing, they had also to start with music from scratch. They found the do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si-do scale sufficient for their needs, avoiding the very complex and difficult to learn international music notation. But due to the limited number of consonants in the Tongan language, the note names were localised into to-le-mi… Unfortunately the word 'tole' is a vulgar expression for the Female genital area, and as such not to be used. Moulton then developed a system where the main notes were indicated with the numbers 3 to 9, while a strike to the digits was used to sharpen them, for example: ~~7~~ , being 7 or 8. At the end the full 12 notes of the octave became: 3- ~~3~~ -4- ~~4~~ -5-6- ~~6~~ -7- ~~7~~ -8- ~~8~~ -9, which are pronounced as: to-lu-fa- ma-ni-o-no-tu-fi-va-a-hi, (variants of the Tongan numerals 3 to 9 being tolu, fā, nima, ono, fitu, valu, hiva). To extend the single octave (MIDI octave number 4) into the next higher, a dot can be put above the number. To reach the next lower, a dot or a little tail can be put under them. If needed 2 tails can be taken to arrive at even lower pitches, but that is rare. Since the notation is made for human singing, it does not need to have the extended range of musical instruments. The Moulton notation, or Tongan notation was extremely popular and is still cherished by the Tongans. It is extremely common to see bandmasters writing out the music on the blackboards in the church halls during choir practices. Pitch Tongan singers recognise up to 4 voices, which results in the typical 4 lines of numbers in the notation. The leading voice is called 'fasi', a male voice. The next one is kānokano or alto, a female voice. The third is the tēnoa or tenor, and the last one the laulalo or bass. Occasionally the bass sings different lyrics from the rest. The middle octave (of the 3 octave range mentioned above) varies with the voice, the kānokano is usually one above the tēnoa, while the laulalo is one below. In addition the exact position of the middle C depends on the key signature as in this schedule: Image:TongaKeys.png When 3 notes are shown, the fasi and alto are together on top, the tenor is in the middle, and the bass is on bottom. When 2 notes are shown, the tenor and bass are taken together, as otherwise the basses would come too low. Some musicians, however, take the bass octave always equal the tenor, causing for some signatures the bass coming too high. Then they need 2 tails under a number to reach a really low note. Duration The duration of a note is not indicated by a different symbols, as in the international music notation but by the number of notes in a beat. The more notes in a beat, the shorter each has to be. For example, in the fasi o e tui o e outTonga (national anthem), we find as first measure: 3:-3/5:56:4/5:-5 Every vertical bar () is a measure separator (often double at the begin and end of a stanza). As this music has a time signature, there appear 4 beats, every beat separated by a colon (:) or slash (/) (they are equal, but the slash is usually used in the middle and the colon elsewhere). The time signature also indicates that every beat is a quarter note. Therefore, every single digit in a beat is a quarter note. When 2 digits appear they are each eighth notes and so forth. No digit at all, or a zero, is used for a rest, while a dash is a tie. The first measure of the example above thus becomes: a C note for a dotted quarter duration, another C for an eighth, followed by two quarter Es. 3:--:- is an example for a time signature; 2 beats in a measure, every beat a quarter note long. This results in a whole C. Note that the tie dashes can extend into following measures, unlike the international music notation where the note is to be repeated and then tie arcs are needed. Some Tonga musicians following that example, would also write a 3 in the second measure instead of a dash and also would then need tie arcs. More time signatures In (like 3:4) and (like 3:4:5) and (like 3:4/5:6) time signature every beat is a quarter note. Two digits (…:34:…) makes each an eighth note; have four digits (…:3456:…) and each is a sixteenth. Three digits (…:345:…) are possible, the first one being a quarter and both others each an eighth, but might be confusing. Some musicians put a comma or dot inside the beat (…:3,45:…) to remind the singers of the unequal duration. But the real use is with a tie (…:3-4:…), to have a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth. and signatures are rarer, but work the same as the quarter-based signatures except that all beats are twice as long. One digit in a beat being a half note and so forth. Occasionally one finds (like 3:4) and (like 3:4:5:6) time signatures. Then every single digit is a dotted quarter note, while the most common occurrence is 3 digits in one beat, (…:345:…) each of them of course one eighth. Also here two digits are possible, the first one being a quarter and the second an eight, but again with all the pitfalls as the 3 digits in the quarter-note notation. It is mainly used for (…:3:-4:…) meaning a note worth five eighths (dotted quarter tied to quarter) followed by a single eighth. References * http://www.tau.olunga.to/fasi.html *Hebert, D. G. (2008).

Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to be fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including Ballarat) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Ballarat was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard in Williamstown, Victoria, on 19 April 1940. She was launched on 10 December 1940 by the wife of Albert Dunstan, then Premier of Victoria, and commissioned into the RAN on 30 August 1941. Operational history Ballarat entered service on 20 September 1941, and on her arrival in Sydney three days later was immediately assigned to the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla. On 1 November, she was given the duty of providing anti-submarine protection to converted ocean liner Queen Mary, prior to her departure as part of a troop convoy to the Middle East. Ballarat departed for Darwin on 14 November, towing an oil lighter. On her arrival on 8 December, the corvette began escort patrols between Darwin and Timor. She headed to Singapore in early 1942, then was assigned to Banka Strait, where she was employed in rescue and demolitions work. On 14 February, Ballarat carried out one of the largest rescue operations in the region, collecting 215 survivors from the torpedoed merchant vessel MV Derrymore. Amongst the survivors was John Gorton, who would later become Prime Minister of Australia. Ballarat was also involved in the evacuation of Sumatra, and was the last RAN ship to leave. On the conclusion of this assignment, the corvette returned to Australian waters and resumed convoy operation between Australia and New Guinea. In November 1942, Ballarat and sister ship Katoomba were attacked by Japanese dive bombers. In December 1942, Ballarat and sister ships Broome and Colac were involved in the deployment of troops to Buna; Ballarat performing four troop deployments over the month. The corvette was ordered to the east coast of Australia in April 1943, to counter the increasing Japanese submarine threat. She remained in this role until January 1944, when she returned to Darwin to perform patrols to Thursday Island. Ballarat was again used as a troop transport in August 1944, moving soldiers from the Eilanden River in Papua New Guinea to Merauke, Indonesia. In 1945 she returned to Sydney to perform minesweeping operations prior to the arrival of the British Pacific Fleet, and then participated in the invasion of Okinawa. Ballarat was present in Tokyo Bay on Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. She was then deployed on minesweeping duties in the Hong Kong area, during which she struck a mine on 6 November 1945. She returned to Melbourne on 13 December, and was decommissioned into reserve on 27 September 1946. Ballarats wartime service was recognised by three battle honours: \\"Pacific 1941–45\\", \\"New Guinea 1942–44\\", and \\"Okinawa 1945\\". Ballarat was sold on 10 July 1947 to China Traders Ltd of Hong Kong, who then sold her on to the Ta Hing Company (Hong Kong) Ltd in December 1950. Refitted as a coastal trader and renamed Carmencita, the corvette never entered civilian service as a Statutory Order issued by the Australian Government prevented the ship from entering Chinese waters. Instead, she was sold a third time to John Manners and Co (Aust) Pty Ltd in 1953, who broke the ship up for scrap in the same year.

It is closely related to Southeast Asian wrestling styles such as naban and is the ancestor of kusti. Indian wrestling is described in the 13th century Malla Purana. Malla-yuddha incorporates grappling, joint-breaking, punching, biting, choking and pressure point striking. Matches were traditionally codified into four types which progressed from purely sportive contests of strength to actual full-contact fights known as yuddha. Due to the extreme violence, this final form is generally no longer practised. The second form, wherein the wrestlers attempt to lift each other off the ground for three seconds, still exists in south India. Additionally, malla-yuddha is divided into four categories (see below). Each yuddhan is named after Hindu gods and legendary fighters: * Hanumanti concentrates on technical superiority. * Jambuvanti uses locks and holds to force the opponent into submission. * Jarasandhi concentrates on breaking the limbs and joints while fighting. * Bhimaseni focuses on sheer strength. Terminology In Sanskrit, ' literally translates to \\"wrestling combat\\". Strictly speaking, the term denotes a single pugilistic encounter or prize- fight rather than a style or school of wrestling. It is a tatpurusha compound of ' (wrestler, boxer, athlete) and ' or ' (fight, battle, conflict). The compound is first attested in the Mahabharata referring to boxing matches such as those fought by Bhima. Another word for a sportive wrestling match or athletic sports more generally is malakhra. The second element, khra (sport, play, pastime, amusement) implies a more limited-contact style of folk wrestling rather than true grappling combat. The term ' was historically a proper name referring to, among other things, an asura known as ' and the name of a tribe from the Malla Kingdom mentioned in the Mahabharata. The name Malla was also used in this sense for an ancient mahajanapada, a Nepalese dynasty descended from them, and the Mallabhum kingdom in Bishnapur. In the Manusmriti (10.22; 12.45), it is the technical term for the offspring of an out-caste kshatriya by a kshatriya female who was previously the wife of another out- caste. History=Origins Wrestling in the Indian subcontinent has a history of at least 5000 years, making it the oldest known codified form of fighting in the region. Competitions held for entertainment were popular among all social classes, with even kings and other royalty taking part. Wrestlers represented their kings in matches between rival kingdoms; death matches before the royal court served as a way to settle disputes and avoid large- scale wars. As such, professional wrestlers were held in high regard. In pastoral communities, people would even wrestle against steers. The first written attestation of the term ' is found in the Ramayana epic, in the context of a wrestling match between the vanara King Bali and Ravana, the king of Lanka. Hanuman, the god in Ramayana, is worshipped as the patron of wrestlers and general feats of strength. The Mahabharata epic also describes a wrestling match between Bhima and Jarasandha. Other early literary descriptions of wrestling matches include the story of Balarama and Krishna. Stories describing Krishna report that he sometimes engaged in wrestling matches where he used knee strikes to the chest, punches to the head, hair pulling, and strangleholds.J. R. Svinth (2002). A Chronological History of the Martial Arts and Combative Sports. Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences. He defeated Kans, king of Mathura, in a wrestling match and became new king in his place. Siddhartha Gautama himself was said to be an expert wrestler, archer and sword-fighter before becoming the Buddha. Based on such accounts, Svinth traces press ups and squats used by Indian wrestlers to the pre-classical era. Later, the Pallava king Narasimhavarman acquired the nickname Mahamalla meaning \\"great wrestler\\" for his passion and prowess in the art. Competitions in medieval times were announced by a kanjira-player a week beforehand. Matches took place at the palace entrance, in an enclosure set aside for games and shows. The wrestlers typically came of their own accord during public festivals, along with magicians, actors and acrobats. Other times they would be hired by nobles to compete. Winners were awarded a substantial cash prize from the king and presented with a victory standard. Possession of this standard brought national distinction. > The scene of action was gay with flags flapping, and the citizenry quickly > packed the rows of benches. When the wrestlers climbed into the arena, they > strutted around, flexing their muscles, leaping in the air, crying out and > clapping their hands. Then they grappled, holding each other tightly around > the waist, their necks resting on each other's shoulder, their legs > entwined, while each attempted to win a fall or break the hold. Manasollasa The Manasollasa of the Chalukya king Someswara III (1124–1138) is a treatise on kingly fine arts and leisure. Anthropologist Joseph Alter writes of it, \\"The chapter entitled 'Malla Vinod' describes the classification of wrestlers into types by age, size and strength. It also outlines how the wrestlers were to exercise and what they were to eat. In particular the king was responsible for providing the wrestlers with pulses, meat, milk, sugar as well as 'high-class sweets'. The wrestlers were kept isolated from the women of the court and were expected to devote themselves to building their bodies.\\" The Manasollasa \\"gives the names of moves and exercises but does not provide descriptions\\". Malla Purana The Malla Purana describes Pramada exercises with clubs; these were still current in the 19th century, as illustrated here The Malla Purana is a Kula Purana associated with the Jyesthimalla, a Brahmin jāti of wrestlers from Gujarat, dating most likely to the 13th century. According to Alter, \\"It categorizes and classifies types of wrestlers, defines necessary physical characteristics, ... describes types of exercises and techniques of wrestling as well as the preparation of the wrestling pit\\", and provides a fairly precise account of which foods wrestlers should eat in each season of the year. The scholar-practitioner Norman Sjoman states that the Malla Purana describes 16 types of exercises for wrestling, namely Rangasrama wrestling as such; Stambhasrama pole exercises; Bhamramanikasrama of unknown meaning; Svasaprenaikasrama stamina exercises like running and skipping; Sthapitasrama, \\"perhaps exercises done erect\\"; Uhapohasrama \\"said not to be an exercise\\"; the use of heavy and light stone rings fastened to poles; Pramada exercises with clubs; Amardankisrama, that Sjoman suspects is a form of massage; Asthadanaka gymnastic exercises for the lower body; Kundakarsank \\"callisthenics with circular movements\\"; the unknown Anyakrtkarasrama; Jalasrama, swimming; Sopanarohana, climbing steps; and Bhojanordhavabhramanika, which Sjoman assumes was a type of callisthenics. Sjoman notes that the Malla Purana (16-21) names 18 hatha yoga postures (asanas) including Simhasana, Kurmasana, Kukkutasana, Garudasana and Sirsasana. Spread Bhima kills Jarasandha in a wrestling match, a folio from the Bhagavata Purana. c. 1520–1540 As the influence of Indian culture spread to Southeast Asia, malla-yuddha was adopted in what are now Thailand, Malaysia, Java, and other neighbouring countries. It became popular not only among commoners but also patronized by royalty. The legendary hero Badang was said to have engaged in such a wrestling match against a visiting champion in Singapore. Decline Traditional Indian wrestling first began to decline in the north after the medieval Muslim invasions when influences from Persian wrestling were incorporated into native malla-yuddha. Under Mughal rule, courtly fashion favoured the Persianate pehlwani style. Traditional malla- yuddha remained popular in the south, however, and was particularly common in the Vijayanagara Empire. The 16th-century Jaina classic Bharatesa Vaibhava describes wrestlers challenging their opponents with grunts and traditional signs of patting the shoulders. Sculptures at Bhatkal depict wrestling matches, including female wrestlers. As part of his daily routine, the king Krishna Deva Raya would rise early and exercise his muscles with the gada (mace) and sword before wrestling with his favourite opponent. His many wives were tended to by only female servants and guards, and among the 12,000 women in the palace were those who wrestled and others who fought with sword and shield. During the Navaratri festival, wrestlers from around the empire would come to the capital in Karnataka to compete in front of the king, as described by the Portuguese traveller Domingo Paes. > Then the wrestlers begin their play. Their wrestling does not seem like > ours, but there are blows (given), so severe as to break teeth, and put out > eyes, and disfigure faces, so much so that here and there men are carried > off speechless by their friends; they give one another fine falls too. Malla-yuddha is now virtually extinct in the northern states, but most of its traditions are perpetuated in modern kusti. The descendants of the Jyesti clan continued to practice their ancestral arts of malla-yuddha and vajra-musti into the 1980s but rarely do so today. Malla-yuddha has survived ceremonially in south India however, and can still be seen in Karnataka\\"The Lost Temples Of India\\". TLC. 1999 and pockets of Tamil Nadu today. Training The historic Jarasandha's Akhara (wrestling arena) mentioned in the Mahabharata epic, at Rajgir in Bihar, India. Wrestlers train and fight in a traditional arena or akhara. Matches take place in a clay or dirt pit, thirty feet across and either square or circular in shape. The soil of the floor is mixed with various ingredients, including ghee. Before training, the floor is raked of any pebbles or stones. Water is added approximately every three days to keep it at the right consistency; soft enough to avoid injury but hard enough so as not to impede the wrestlers' movements. Wrestlers begin each session by flattening the soil, an act which is considered both a part of endurance training and an exercise in self-discipline. During practice, wrestlers throw a few handfuls of dirt onto their own bodies and that of their opponents as a form of blessing, which also provides for a better grip. Once the arena has been prepared a prayer is offered to the gym's patron deity, most commonly Hanuman. Every training hall has a small makeshift altar for this purpose, where incense is lit and small yellow flower garlands are offered to the god. This is followed by paying respect to the guru by touching the head to his feet, a traditional sign of respect for elders in the Indian subcontinent. Many wrestlers live at their training hall but this is not always required. Traditionally revered as extensions of Hanuman, all wrestlers are required to abstain from sex, smoking and drinking so the body remains pure and the wrestlers are able to focus on cultivating themselves physically, mentally and spiritually. This purity is also said to help achieve the highest level of martial and sporting perfection. A wrestler's only belongings are a blanket, a kowpeenam (loincloth) and some clothes. In this regard, they are often compared to Hindu-Buddhist holy men. Boys typically start training at the age of ten to twelve. To avoid stunting their growth, young trainees are first taught kundakavartana, callisthenics and exercises to develop their overall strength and endurance without equipment. Exercises that employ the wrestler's own bodyweight include the sun salutation (Surya Namaskara), shirshasana, Hindu squat (bethak) and the Hindu press-up (danda), which are also found in hatha yoga. After acquiring the necessary power and stamina, students may begin khambhasrama, referring to exercises that use the mallakhamba or wrestler's pillar. There are a number of pillars, although the most common is a free-standing upright pole, some eight to ten inches in diameter, planted into the ground. Wrestlers mount, dismount and utilize this pole for various complex callisthenics designed to develop their grip, stamina, and strength in the arms, legs and upper-body. In a later variation, the pole was replaced with a hanging rope. Rope mallakhamba is today most commonly practiced by children as a spectator sport in itself rather than its traditional role as a form of training for wrestling. Other training concepts include the following. * Vyayam: Physical training in general. This includes rope climbing, log pulling, running and swimming. * Rangasrama: Refers to the wrestling itself and its techniques. Includes locks, submission holds, takedowns and, formerly, strikes. * Gonitaka: Exercises done with a large stone ring called a gar nal in Hindi. It can be swung, lifted, or worn around the neck to add resistance to press-ups and squats. * Pramada: Exercises performed with the gada (mace). An exercise gada is a heavy round stone attached to the end of a meter-long bamboo stick. * Uhapohasrama: Discussion of tactics and strategies. * Mardana: Traditional massage. Wrestlers are given massages and also taught how to massage.

Edwards went on directing all of the Fox Film Corporation's mega-budget spectacles, including all of actress Theda Bara's productions between 1916 and 1919. Later, he became the production supervisor at Fox, and continued to direct until he died in 1925. One of his biggest projects was The Queen of Sheba (1921), a lost silent film which contained a huge chariot race, four years before Ben-Hur (1925). Essentially all of his films (other than a few low quality prints) for Fox Studios were lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire, which claimed 75% of all Fox films made before 1930. He was the stepgrandfather of director Blake Edwards. Edwards died of pneumonia at age 58 in New York City and was interred at Kensico Cemetery in a grandiose private mausoleum with a minaret on each side similar to the Taj Mahal.

His work involved product packages such as \\"The Greatest Vitamin in the World\\" and \\"Making Money Secrets\\". Lapre was criticized as selling questionable business plans that often did not work for his clients. In June 2011, Lapre was charged with 41 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and promotional money laundering related to his Internet businesses. He was arrested on June 24, 2011, for failing to appear in court to face these charges. Business ventures Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Lapre moved to Phoenix, Arizona with his family when he was a child. He married Sally Redondo in 1988. A high-school dropout, in 1990, Lapre and his wife started a credit repair business called Unknown Concepts. Lapre then began selling a 36-page booklet explaining how to recover a Federal Housing Administration insurance refund after paying off a home mortgage. He also began offering \\"900\\" phone lines. On TV infomercials in the early-mid 1990s, he claimed that by placing \\"tiny classified ads\\" in newspapers he was \\"able to make $50,000 a week from [his] tiny one-bedroom apartment\\". In 1992, Lapre began broadcasting The Making Money Show with Don Lapre, which suggested that viewers could make money as easily as he had. For several years the show was ranked among the 10 most frequently broadcast cable television infomercials. The principal product was Lapre's \\"Money Making Secrets\\", a package of booklets, tapes, and common-sense tips for placing ads and operating a 900-number business. The product was sold through New Strategies, whose parent company was Tropical Beaches. He later began broadcasting infomercials for \\"The Greatest Vitamin in the World\\". In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned Lapre about claims his vitamins were intended as a drug for diseases such as diabetes, stroke, heart disease, insomnia, cancer, and arthritis.

Federal prosecutors accused Lapre of bilking more than 220,000 victims out of nearly $52 million. He was charged with 41 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, promotional money laundering, and transactional money laundering. A federal judge issued a bench warrant for Lapre on June 22, 2011, after he failed to appear at his arraignment. On June 27, 2011, Lapre was arrested in Tempe, Arizona, at a Life Time Fitness center, where he had reportedly lived for two days, with serious self-inflicted knife wounds to his groin. The wounds led authorities to believe Lapre had attempted suicide while at Life Time Fitness by attempting to sever the femoral artery in his legs. Death Lapre died on October 2, 2011, while in jail awaiting his trial, which was scheduled to begin on October 4, 2011.

He was the first governor from Charleston since the Civil War and one of only twenty people in United States history to have been elected mayor, governor, and United States senator. During his tenure in the Senate, Maybank was a powerful ally of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His unexpected death on September 1, 1954, from a heart attack, led to Strom Thurmond being elected senator. Early life and family Maybank was born in Charleston, South Carolina, into one of the city's most prominent and wealthy families. He was the direct descendant of five former South Carolina governors: Thomas Smith, Rawlins Lowndes, Robert Gibbes, James Moore and William Aiken, Jr. Additionally, he was related to U.S. Senator Robert Barnwell Rhett. Maybank graduated from the Porter Military Academy (now known as Porter-Gaud) and went on to earn a degree from the College of Charleston. He served in the United States Navy during World War I. Burnet Maybank was born to Dr. Joseph Maybank VI and Harriet Lowndes Rhett, the first of ten. He married Elizabeth deRosset Myers on June 28, 1923. They had three children. After the death of his first wife Maybank married Mary Roscoe Randolph Pelzer Cecil. The second marriage produced no children. His son, Burnet R. Maybank Jr., went on to become lieutenant governor of South Carolina and a later candidate for governor. Career=Mayor of Charleston Prior to becoming interested in politics and public service, Maybank had established himself in the cotton export business from 1920 to 1938. A lifelong Democrat, Maybank entered politics for the first time in 1927, when he was elected to a four-year term as alderman in Charleston. He rose to mayor pro tempore in 1930 and was then elected mayor of Charleston in 1931, serving until 1938. As mayor, Maybank balanced the budget during the Great Depression. He refused an increase of his own salary to $6,000 from $3,600, and reduced local taxes. Maybank took advantage of federal financing under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration for slum clearance, construction of public housing and other infrastructure, and support for unemployment payments. He also used a Works Progress Administration (WPA) grant to restore the historic Dock Street Theatre, and other grants went to such infrastructure improvements as the city docks and a city incinerator. During this period Maybank was also appointed as a member of the State Board of Bank Control (1932–1933) and was chairman of the South Carolina Public Service Authority (1935–1939). It supervised a state-sponsored power project on the Santee River. This project, known as the \\"little TVA,\\" was built to control floods as well as provide hydroelectric power for the state. Maybank was a conservative supporter of President Roosevelt's New Deal, which funded public works and job programs. But he opposed a share of the president's labor policies. In addition, he was appointed by the governor as a member of the South Carolina State Advisory Board of the federal Public Works Administration from 1933 to 1934. Then-Senator Maybank sold the historic Col. John Stuart House in 1950, saying, \\"I merely sold my large house because it is not fair for one of Charleston's oldest homes to be closed up 11 months during the year.\\"  Governor of South Carolina  With the favorable publicity from the Santee project, a strong political base in Charleston, and support from his mentor, U.S. Senator James F. Byrnes, Maybank was elected as governor in 1938. As governor, Maybank tried unsuccessfully to create an adequate state police force, but he did supervise a vigorous prosecution of the criminal element in the state. He strictly enforced liquor and gambling statutes. Maybank personally interceded to prevent to destruction of a high wall around the historic jail in Charleston when it became threatened by a housing project expansion. He fought the Ku Klux Klan, which had reached its peak of revival in the 1920s but was still active. Maybank expanded economic opportunities for blacks in the racially segregated society and tried to improve the quality of black schools in the state, which were historically underfunded. He did nothing to alter the disfranchisement of blacks due to provisions in the state constitution and electoral laws since the turn of the twentieth century.  Senator and premature death  In January 1941 President Roosevelt appointed Byrnes to the U.S. Supreme Court. Maybank won a special election to fill Byrnes's US Senate seat in September 1941, defeating former governor Olin D. Johnston with 56.6 percent of the vote. In 1942 Maybank was elected to the full six-year term, and in 1948 he was reelected without opposition, and served until his death in 1954. Maybank was a powerful senator, part of the southern Democratic block. Maybank served as chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency and as co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Defense Production. As chair of the Subcommittee on Independent Offices, under the Appropriations Committee, Maybank provided critical support to continue the U.S. nuclear weapons program in the early 1950s. He introduced the \\"Maybank Amendment,\\" which was tacked onto the 1953 Defense Appropriations Bill. The amendment relieved the Department of Defense from federal legislation to target a percentage of its expenditures to high unemployment areas.Burnet Maybank Senatorial Papers , College of Charleston Shortly before his death, Maybank was voted as one of the \\"20 Most Influential Americans\\" by Fortune Magazine. Maybank died of a heart attack at his summer home in Flat Rock, North Carolina in 1954.\\"Beneath the Magnolias,\\" Time Magazine, 13 September 1954. He was interred in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston. Several dignitaries attended including then-Governor James F. Byrnes, Strom Thurmond, Ernest F. Hollings, thirteen United States senators, congressmen, and state and local officials. Maybank's sudden death two months before Election Day threw open the 1954 Senate election in South Carolina. Strom Thurmond won as a write-in candidate against the nominee chosen by Democratic party leaders to replace Maybank. Following Maybank's death, numerous places throughout the state were named in his honor including Maybank Highway, the Burnet Maybank Bridge, and the Maybank Hall at the College of Charleston. Recent news Bertie Bowman, who became a hearing coordinator for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, published his memoir, Step by Step: A Memoir of Hope, Friendship, Perseverance, and Living the American Dream, in 2009. He noted the personal support he had received from Senator Maybank. A poor black farmer's son, he went to Washington from South Carolina in 1944 as a runaway at age 14 and went to Senator Maybank. He got the youth a janitor's position, and took a personal interest in Bowman (who then had no family in Washington). Gradually the young black man advanced while working for the Senate, as he describes in his memoir. In March 2009 Senator Maybank's granddaughter, Elizabeth Parker, traveled to D.C. to meet with Bowman for the first time. A month later, more of the Maybank family met Bowman and his wife, Elaine, in Charleston. Vice President Joe Biden mentioned Maybank at the dedication ceremony for the Ernest Hollings Special Collections Library at the University of South Carolina on July 23, 2010. He said, > You know, an old governor of yours, Burnet Maybank, once wrote an essay > entitled, 'Who Is the South Carolinian?' And here's what it said. He said, > there's a deal—there is a deal of kindness about him, describing the South > Carolinian. He feels favored when asked for personal assistance. A > neighborly spirit prompts him to render service with a scorn for > remuneration.http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId;=574&topicId;=25188&docId;=l:1228631960&start;=3 See also * List of United States Congress members who died in office (1950–99) ReferencesSources * Dictionary of American Biography * Cann, Marvin. \\"Burnet Rhett Maybank and the New Deal in South Carolina from 1931 to 1941.\\" PhD dissertation, University of North Carolina, 1967 * U.S. Congress.

The period of the imperial Cholas (c. 850 CE - 1250 CE) in South India was an age of continuous improvement and refinement of Dravidian art and architecture. They utilised the wealth earned through their extensive conquests in building long-lasting stone temples and exquisite bronze sculptures, in an almost exclusively Hindu cultural setting. The Cholas built their temples in the traditional way of the Pallava dynasty, who were themselves influenced by the Amaravati school of architecture. The Chola artists and artisans further drew their influences from other contemporary art and architectural schools and elevated the Dravidian temple design to greater heights.Tripathi, p 479 The Chola kings built numerous temples throughout their kingdom, which normally comprised the plains, Central and Northern Tamil Nadu and at times the entire state of Tamil Nadu as also adjoining parts of modern Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. In the evolution of the Chola temple architecture we can roughly see three major phases, beginning with the early phase, starting with Vijayalaya Chola and continuing till Sundara Chola, the middle phase of Rajaraja Chola and Rajendra Chola when the achievements scaled heights never reached before or since and the final phase during the Chalukya Chola period of Kulottunga Chola I till the demise of the Chola empire. The Cholas in addition to their temples, also built many buildings such as hospitals, public utility buildings and palaces. Many such buildings find mention in their inscriptions and in contemporary accounts. The golden palace that Aditya Karikala supposedly built for his father Sundara Chola is an example of such a building. However, such buildings were of perishable materials such as timber and fired bricks and have not survived the ravages of time. Early Chola Period Pallavas were the first recognisable South Indian dynasty who indulged in the pursuit of architectural innovations. The first seeds of Dravidian temple architecture in Tamil Nadu were possibly sown during this period. The temple architecture evolved from the early cave temples and monolith temples of Mamallapuram to the Kailasanatha and Vaikuntaperumal temples of Kanchipuram. This architecture style formed the foundation from which the Cholas, who were in close contact with the Pallavas during their periods of decline, took some valuable lessons according to Nilakanta Sastri, in his A History of South India. Vijayalaya Choleswaram The early Cholas built numerous temples. Aditya I and Parantaka I were prolific builders for their faith. Inscriptions of Aditya I record that he built a number of temples along the banks of the river Kaveri. These temples were much smaller in comparison to the huge monumental structures of the later Cholas and were probably brick structures rather than stone. The Vijayalacholeswaram near Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu is an example of a surviving early Chola building. The style of this structure clearly shows Pallava influences in the design. It has an unusual arrangement of a circular garba griha (where the deity resides) within a square prakara - circumbulatory corridor. Above this rises the vimana or the tower in four diminishing storeys of which the lower three are square and the top circular. Each level is separated from the next by a cornice. The whole structure is surmounted by a dome which in turn is topped with a stone kalasa - a crest. Very faint traces of paintings can be seen inside on the walls. These paintings are dated not earlier than the 17th century. The little temple of Nageswara at Kumbakonam is also of the same period. The Koranganatha Temple at Srinivasanallur near Hirapalli is an example of the period of Parantaka I. This temple is situated on the banks of the river Kaveri, and is a small temple with beautiful sculptures on every surface. The base of the wall has a row of sculpted mythical animals that were a unique feature of Chola architecture. The first floor is made of bricks which have been plastered. Muvarkovil Temple in the Pudukkottai area was built by a feudatory of Parantaka Chola II during the second half of the tenth century. As the name suggests, the temple complex has three main shrines standing side by side in a row, along the north-south direction, facing west. Out of these three, only two, the central and southern vimanams (towers) are now extant. Of the third or the northern shrine, the basement alone remains. The architectural style of these shrines exhibit clear concordance with the later Chola temples.Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India, p420 Medieval Period gangaikonda cholapuram Temple building received great impetus from the conquests and the genius of Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola I.Vasudevan, pp21–24 A number of smaller shrines were built during the early phase of this period. Notable amongst these is the Tiruvalisvaram temple near Tirunelveli. The temple is covered with exquisite well composed sculptures and friezes some containing comic figures. The entire cornice of the temple tower is embellished with designs of creepers and foliage. Other examples of such temples can be seen at the Vaidyanatha Temple at Tirumalavadi and the Uttara Kailasa Temple at Thanjavur.Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India, p421 The maturity and grandeur to which the Chola architecture had evolved found expression in the two magnificent temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram.Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India, p387 The magnificent Siva temple of Thanjavur, completed around 1009 is a fitting memorial to the material achievements of the time of Rajaraja.Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India, p422 The largest and tallest of all Indian temples, it is a masterpiece constituting the high-water mark of South Indian architecture.Keay, p216Vasudevan, p45 It is in this temple that one notices for the first time two gopuras (gateway towers, here oriented in the same direction). They are architecturally coeval with the main vimana and are referred to in inscriptions as Rajarajan tiruvasal and Keralantakan tiruvasal. In spite of the massive size of the gopuras, the vimana, rising majestically to a height of 190 feet, continues to dominate and it is only in the subsequent period that a change in the gradation of magnitude takes place. Epigraphic evidence reveals that Rajaraja started building this temple in his 19th regnal year and it was completed on 275th day of his 25th regnal year (1010), taking only 6 years.Vasudevan, p44 Rajaraja named this temple as Rajarajesvaram and the deity Shiva in Linga form as Peruvudaiyar, the temple is also known in the deity's name as Peruvudaiyarkovil. In later period Maratha and Nayaks rulers constructed various shrines and gopurams of the temple. In later period when the Sanskrit language was more popular during the Maratha rule the temple was named in Sanskrit as Brihadisvaram and the deity as Brihadisvara. This temple carries on its walls the engraved evidence of the elaborate administrative and financial procedures concerning the day-to-day administration of the temple. The inscriptions give, apart from a comprehensive history of the times, a full enumeration of all the metallic images set up in the temple. Numbering about sixty-six, these icons are referred to with a description of the minutest details of size, shape and composition. This alone is a mine of information for the art historian. The temple stands within a fort,ut 200 feet in height and is referred to as Dakshina Meru (Southern Mountain). The octagonal Shikharam (crest) rests on a single block of granite weighing 81 tons. It is believed that this block was carried up a specially built ramp built from a site 6 kilometres away from the temple. Huge Nandis (figures of the sacred bull) dot the corners of the Shikharam, and the Kalasam on top by itself is about 3.8 metres in height. Hundreds of stucco figures bejewel the Vimanam, although it is possible that some of these may have been added on during the Maratha period. The main deity is a lingam and is a huge, set in a two storeyed sanctum, and the walls surrounding the sanctum delight visitors as a storehouse of murals and sculptures. The temple is built entirely of granite in a place where there is no source of granite.Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India, p423Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India, p5 Though the temple of Gangaikonda Cholapuram follows the plan of the great temple of Thanjavur in most details it has characteristics of its own. From the remains it may be seen that it had only one enclosure wall and a gopura while the Thanjavur temple has two gopuras and enclosures. It is larger in plan though not as tall, the vimana being 100 feet square at the base and 186 feet high. The temple, which forms a large rectangle 340 feet long and 110 feet wide occupies the middle of an immense walled enclosure mainly built for defensive purposes. The vimana has the same construction as in Thanjavur, but the number of tiers making up the pyramidal body is only eight as against 13 in Thanjavur. The most important difference lies in the introduction of curves in the place of the strong straight lines of the Thanjavur vimana. The pyramidal body is slightly concave in its outline at its angles while the sides are curved to produce a somewhat convex outline. These curves enhance the beauty of form of the vimana though they distract from its stateliness and power.Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India, pp423–424Jagadisa Ayyar, p293–294 Later Period Spoked chariot wheel, Airavateswarar Temple, Darasuram c. 1200 C.E. The horse-drawn chariot is carved on the front of the mandapam. The chariot and its wheel are so finely sculpted that they include even the faintest details The Chola style continued to flourish for a century longer and expressed itself in a very large number of temples. Of these two large temples are worthy of comparison to those of Rajaraja and Rajendra. The Airavateswara temple at Darasuram near Thanjavur built during the reign of Rajaraja Chola II is a magnificent structure typical of the stage of architectural development reached in the 12th century CE. This temple has artistic stone pillars and decorations on its walls, in a style bordering on mannerism, with an emphasis on elongated limbs and polished features. Best among them are the dark black basalt figures in the temple niches of Dakshinamurti, the image on the southern side of Shiva in a teaching attitude, and to the west, Shiva erupting out of the pillar of light to convince Brahma and Vishnu of his superiority. The front mandapam is in the form of a huge chariot drawn by horses.Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India, pp424–425Jagadisa Ayyar, p349–353 The final example of this period is the Kampaheswarar temple at Tribhuvanam near Kumbakonam which has survived in good repair as built by Kulothunga Chola III.Chopra et al., p 129 The architecture of this temple is similar to the temples at Tanjore, Gangaikondacholapuram and Darasuram.Jagadisa Ayyar, p316'''  Sculpture and bronzes  With heavily ornamented pillars accurate in detail and richly sculpted walls, the Airavateswara temple at Darasuram is a classic example of Chola art and architecture Chola Bronze icon. Shiva and Parvathi c. 1200 C.E. The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes.Chopra et al., p 186 Among the existing specimens in the various museums of the world and in the temples of South India, may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms accompanied by his consort Parvati and the other gods, demigods and goddesses of the Saivaite pantheon, Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, the Nayanmars, other Saiva saints and many more. Though conforming generally to the iconographic conventions established by long tradition, the sculptor could also exercise his imagination within the boundaries of the canonical Hindu iconography and worked in greater freedom during the eleventh and the twelfth centuries. As a result, the sculptures and bronzes show classic grace, grandeur and taste. The best example of this can be seen in the form of Nataraja, the Divine Dancer. Purpose of the Icons While the stone sculpture and the inner sanctum image empowering the temple remained immovable, changing religious concepts during the period around the 10th century demanded that the deities take part in a variety of public roles similar to those of a human monarch. As a result, large bronze images were created to be carried outside the temple to participate in daily rituals, processions, and temple festivals. The round lugs and holes found on the bases of many of these sculptures are for the poles that were used to carry the heavy images. The deities in bronze who participated in such festivities were sumptuously clothed and decorated with precious jewellery. Their every need and comfort were catered to by a battery of temple priests, musicians, cooks, devadasis, administrators and patrons. The lay public thronged the processional route to have a darshan and admired their beloved deity for the lavish depiction of the figure and the grand costumes and jewelry. Detail of a Statue of Rajaraja Chola I at the Brihadisvara Temple Although bronze casting has a long history in south India, a much larger and a much greater number of bronze sculptures in all sizes ranging from massive to miniature were cast during the Chola period than before, further attesting to the importance of bronze sculpture during this period. When in worship, these images are bedecked in silk costumes, garlands, and gem encrusted jewels, befitting the particular avatar and religious context. Decorating temple bronzes in this way is a tradition at least a thousand years old and such decorations are referred to in 10th-century Chola inscriptions. In recent times, many of these priceless Chola bronzes have been stolen from their temples or museums, smuggled out of India and have found their way into the private museums of art collectors. Lost wax technique Chola period bronzes were created using the lost wax technique.Wolpert p.158 It is known in artistic terms as \\"Cire Perdue\\". The Sanskrit Shilpa texts call it the Madhu Uchchishtta Vidhana. Beeswax and kungilium (a type of camphor) are mixed with a little oil and kneaded well. The figure is sculpted from this mixture fashioning all the minute details. This is the wax model original. The entire figure is then coated with clay made from termite hills until the mould is of a necessary thickness. Then the whole thing is dried and fired in an oven with cow-dung cakes. The wax model melts and flows out, while some of it vapourises. The metal alloy of bronze is melted and poured into the empty clay-mould. This particular bronze alloy is known as Pancha Loham. When the metal has filled all crevices and has settled and hardened and cooled, the mould is broken off. The bronze figure thus obtained is then cleaned, finer details are added, blemishes are removed, smoothened, and polished well. Hence each bronze icon is unique and the mould cannot be used to create copies. Style Chola bronzes are few intricate ornament in comparison with the subsequent bronzes of the Vijayanagar and Nayaka period. There is gentle grace, a restrained and quiet elegance, an ethereal, out-worldly beauty, and above all else - a life that throbs and pulsates and thereby enlivens the bronze sculpture. By means of the facial expressions, the gestures or mudras the overall body posture and other accompanying bronzes we can imagine the surroundings and the religious context of the figure of the god or goddess; what instrument or weapon he or she is holding; what he or she is leaning on; and what he or she is doing or about to do. For example, in the Rishabaandhika or the Vrishabavahana murthy pose, we see Shiva standing with one leg youthfully crossed across the other and his arm elegantly flexed and raised as if resting or leaning on something. In this elegant posture, it can be surmised that the youthful and athletic Shiva is leaning on his bull-vahana, Nandhi, on whose shoulders He is resting His arm. Bronze Chola Statue of Nataraja at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City The most famous of all the bronze icons is that of Nataraja or Adavallar.Wolpert, p174 The symbolism presents Shiva as lord of the cosmic dance of creation and destruction. He is active, yet aloof, like the gods on the Parthenon Frieze. Surrounding Shiva, a circle of flames represents the universe, whose fire is held in Shiva's left rear palm. His left front arm crosses his chest, the hand pointing in \\"elephant trunk\\" position (gaja hasta) to his upraised left foot, which signifies liberation. His right foot tramples the dwarf Apasmara, who represents ignorance. Shiva's right front hand is raised in the \\"fear-not\\" gesture of benediction (abhaya mudra), while his right rear hand holds a drum with which he beats the measure of the dance. The snake, an emblem of Siva, curls around his arm. His hair holds the crescent moon - another emblem - and a small image of Ganges, the river-goddess whose precipitous fall from heaven to earth is broken by Siva's matted locks. Shiva as Nataraja or Adavallar is also accompanied by his consort Sivakami. Museum holdings Notable collections of the bronzes are held by the museum inside the Thanjavur Maratha Palace, the Government Museum, Chennai, Pondicherry Museum, and Indian Museum, Kolkata. Outside India, Chola bronze sculptures are owned by the British Museum, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Norton Simon Museum, in Pasadena, and the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. Chola frescoes Chola Fresco of Dancing girls. Brihadisvara Temple c. 1100 C.E. In 1931, Chola frescoes were discovered within the circumambulatory corridor of the Brihadisvara Temple, by S.K. Govindasamy, a professor at the Annamalai University. These are the first Chola paintings discovered. The passage of the corridor is dark and the walls on either side are covered with two layers of paintings from floor to ceiling. Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescoes. A smooth batter of limestone mixture is applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments. Another fresco found in the Brihadisvara Temple During the Nayak period, the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescos lying underneath have an ardent spirit of saivism expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Chola. Other crafts The art of making ornaments of gold and precious stones had reached an advanced stage about the beginning of the 11th century. A large number of ornaments are mentioned in the Thanjavur inscriptions.See South Indian Inscriptions, Vol 2 NotesReferences     External links * http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/chola/chola.htm - The lost wax process. * https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id;_site=250 * http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1967587,00.html * http://www.varalaaru.com - Several articles related to chola art and architecture * Vijayalaya Choleswaram - https://web.archive.org/web/20060105115131/http://www.pudukkottai.org/places/narttamalai/02narttamalai.html * Koranganatha Temple - http://www.tn.gov.in/trichytourism/other.htm * Brihadiswara Temple - http://www.thanjavur.com/bragathe.htm * Gangaikondacholapuram - https://web.archive.org/web/20060615123255/http://tamilartsacademy.com/books/gcpuram/cover.html * Chola Fresco - http://www.thebigtemple.com/frescos.html * Bronze Sculpture of the Chola Period - https://web.archive.org/web/20060207215253/http://www.asiasocietymuseum.org/region_results.asp?RegionID=1&CountryID;=1&ChapterID;=7 * Devotion in South India: Chola Bronzes, Asia Society Museum exhibition Art Art Category:Indian art Category:Indian sculpture Category:Cultural history of Tamil Nadu Category:Medieval art Category:Dravidian architecture Category:Chola architecture Category:Chola dynasty ","title":"Chola art and architecture"},{"id":"4416668","text":"Richard John Carwardine (born 12 January 1947) is a Welsh historian and academic, who specialises in American Politics and religion in the era of the American Civil War.

McDougall was third-in-command on Fraser's team, functioning as junior clerk to John Stuart. Fraser and his crew entered the territory they would call New Caledonia in 1805, a foray that would culminate in the successful descent and ascent of the Fraser River in the spring and summer of 1808. During that time, Fraser and his men constructed several fur-trading posts. The first of these resulted from a trip undertaken by Fraser and McDougall up the Parsnip River in the autumn of 1805, in order to determine an ideal route for reaching the Fraser from the Peace River canyon, which was a major portal at the time into the territory west of the Rocky Mountains. Their travels resulted in the establishment by Fraser of the first post and permanent European settlement west of the Rockies, at present- day McLeod Lake. That winter Connor Swingle, the crew member left in charge of the deserted nascent post, and McDougall were charged with administration of the post while Fraser and Stuart were engaged elsewhere. During that time, McDougall seized the initiative to investigate reports he had received of an important lake and fur region to the northwest, in the heart of the region inhabited by the Dakelh First Nation. He journeyed down the as-yet unnamed Fraser River, becoming the first European to find and ascend the Nechako River, a major tributary that Sir Alexander Mackenzie, travelling that way twelve years earlier, had inexplicably missed. From there, McDougall ascended the Stuart River to its source at Stuart Lake. McDougall would later go on to explore what has come to be known as British Columbia's \\"Lake Country\\", ascending the Nechako beyond Fraser Lake as far as Babine Lake and Francois Lake. The fruit of McDougall's explorations would be the construction by Fraser of a post at Stuart Lake, Fort St. James, which would become headquarters of the New Caledonia department of the North West Company (merged in 1821 with the Hudson's Bay Company). Following Fraser's expedition, McDougall stayed in New Caledonia to assist Stuart as a trader at the Fort St. James' post for a period of some years.

The shooting was perpetrated by then fourteen-year-old student James Scott Newman who shot and injured two 14-year- old eighth grade classmates with a .38-caliber revolver that had belonged to his parents. Newman was arrested and charged as an adult on charges of attempted murder, use of a deadly weapon and use of a firearm by a minor but later pleaded guilty to different charges of two counts of battery with a deadly weapon, in which he had received sentencing as a juvenile. James Newman was sentenced to house arrest until he completed 200 hours of community service. On March 25, 2008, athletics teacher Jencie Fagan, who was hailed a hero for her confrontation with the shooter, was selected as one of the three national winners for the Above & Beyond Citizen Honor from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society at a ceremony in Washington, D.C.  The shooting  On the day of the shooting, the start of school had been delayed by snow and not all students had arrived when the shooting began. Just before 9:00 a.m. (UTC-8), fourteen-year-old student James Scott Newman brought his mother's .38-caliber revolver to the school in his backpack. He removed the concealed pistol from his coat pocket and loaded it with three .38 caliber rounds while in the bathroom. He chose his target, student Alexander Rueda, 14, at random in a hallway outside the cafeteria. Before he started firing, a friend of Newman yelled at him to put the gun away, but Newman told him to run. He pulled the trigger twice but the gun did not fire because those chambers were empty. He then fired three times at Rueda. One bullet hit Rueda in the arm and torso, and another ricocheted and hit student Kenzie McKeon, 14, in the leg from the shrapnel. The two injured students had no prior relationship or arguments with Newman. Several students and teachers heard the shots and the physical education teacher, Jencie Fagan, approached Newman and challenged him. Fagan managed to convince Newman to drop his gun and then restrained him until more staff arrived to help. Alexander Rueda was treated at Washoe Medical Center for his wounds and released the same day, while Kenzie McKeon only needed to be treated at the scene for superficial wounds. The school was placed on lockdown for an hour and then classes were canceled for the remainder of the day. The shooting was the second firearm-related incident on Pine Middle School grounds in two weeks, with the previous incident being a man brandishing a gun towards the campus. On that occasion school administrators sent students home as a precaution. Motive After the shooting, Newman was interviewed by the police and remained determined that he did not want his parents to be present during questioning, however Newman's father had arrived sometime after to ask for the questioning to stop until a lawyer would be consulted. During questioning Newman stated that he wanted to use the attack as a way to end abuse from his father, brother, and others. He said he was tired of being called \\"stupid\\" by them. He researched the Columbine High School massacre on the Internet and planned the attack about a week in advance. He conclusively decided against using a knife because \\"he did not want to be up close when blood came out of any of the victims\\". The night before the attack, Newman's father had given him a collection of ammunition which included three live .38 caliber rounds. When his parents left the house to eat, he took his mother's handgun from a small safe in his father's closet and hid it in his backpack.  Aftermath  Following the shooting, police arrested James Newman and booked him as an adult on charges of suspicion of attempted murder, use of a deadly weapon and use of a firearm by a minor in Washoe County Jail with a bail of $150,000. However, his trial was put on hold as prosecutors discussed whether he should be tried as an adult or juvenile. Washoe District Attorney Richard Gammick had announced on March 17 that the evidence given did not support Newman being charged as an adult. By May 2006, Newman was tried as a juvenile by the Jan Evans Juvenile Justice Center for the charges of two counts of battery with a deadly weapon, instead of the initial charges and was put under house arrest until he completed 200 hours of community service. On March 25, 2008, Jencie Fagan was selected as one of three national winners and the Nevada finalist for an Above & Beyond Citizen Honor from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society in the Washington, D.C. ceremony, being recognized for her role in prevention of any further incident in the shooting.

The railroad was built south along Johnson Street in Macomb, Illinois, to nearby Industry and Littleton by local financier Charles V. Chandler. It was open for service on January 1, 1904. It ran for about twenty-five years. History Promoter and builder Charles V. Chandler intended the Macomb and Western Illinois Railway (M&WI;) as a local road to provide freight and passenger service to and from locations between Macomb and Littleton, to give farmers a way of transporting grain and livestock to Macomb, and to eventually connect Macomb with the national railway network. Planned as an electric interurban but lacking sufficient capital to construct the necessary infrastructure, the railroad began service with a primitive - and marginally useful - gas-electric locomotive. The railroad encountered problems from the start. Many people were opposed to the expansion of Chandler's business empire and of his influence as the town's leading Republican. Many who before had helped fund similar projects pulled out. The railroad's president and C. V.'s business partner sold his interest in the business within two years to Chandler. A year after service began the railroad's engine house burned down, destroying its gas- electric locomotive. The local Illinois bituminous coal hauled from mines near Littleton had a sulfur content that rendered it unmarketable for most industrial and domestic uses. The track was lightweight and roadbed was marginal at best, and consequently derailments were common. Property owners along Johnson Street in Macomb filed a series of lawsuits to evict the railroad from the city streets, efforts which were eventually successful and which also had the effect of scaring off investors. In 1910 the Bank of Macomb, owned by C.V. Chandler, went bankrupt and Chandler later left town to live with his son in Indianapolis. As part of the bankruptcy the M&WI; was sold to the Chicago House Wrecking Company, which intended to abandon the railroad and sell it for scrap. In 1913, the railroad was bought back by a group of local farmers and merchants from the area and was reorganized as the Macomb, Industry & Littleton Railway (MI&L;). This railroad operated through the remainder of the 1910s and 1920s. Starting in 1925, however, the railroad's fortunes began to decline due to the construction of hard (paved) roads paralleling the right-of-way. The decline in traffic, coupled with increased maintenance costs from a decaying infrastructure, led to the railroad's abandonment in 1930. In that year the railroad's assets were sold at auction, the tracks were torn up and all of the rolling stock except for one steam engine was scrapped. Right-of-way Originally the M&WI; started at its north end where Johnson Street in Macomb crosses the CB&Q.; There was an interchange with the Burlington at that location, from which the tracks proceeded down the center of Johnson Street to the edge of town. Just south of St. Francis Hospital the railroad crossed onto private right-of-way running along the west side of South Johnson Street (later known as St. Francis Blacktop). South of Beaumont Road the line curved and headed straight east before entering Industry from the northwest on a winding alignment. South of Industry the railroad headed more-or-less straight south until the Carters Creek crossing, after which it curved gently to the west before assuming a direct north-south alignment down the east side of Main Street in Littleton. In late 1904 a lawsuit brought against the railroad compelled it to tear up the block and a half of tracks north of Jackson Street in Macomb, severing its link with the CB&Q.; A belt line was constructed to enable interchange of equipment on the west side of Macomb; this line split off the main line just south of St. Francis Hospital. At this location a wye, engine house and small yard was constructed. In 1908 all trackage on Johnson Street was torn up following another lawsuit, and thereafter M&WI; (and later MI&L;) trains accessed downtown Macomb via a trackage rights agreement with the Burlington. There were several sidings along the railroad. These were located at Henderson, Andrews, Four Mile, Industry (two sidings), Runkle, and Littleton. There was also a wye with an engine house on the south side of Littleton. Rolling stock The railroad owned a succession of locomotives during its life, listed here in chronological order of acquisition: *1 - Baldwin 0-4-4T, ex-Chicago Union Terminal, ex-South Side Rapid Transit, acq 1903 *unnumbered - six-wheel gas-electric boxcab, built new 1903 *2 - 4-4-0, acq between 1904 and 1907, destroyed in Industry wreck in 1907 *4 - 4-4-0, acq prior to 1907, scrapped c1915 *5 - Davenport 2-6-0, acq new 1914, sold 1930 *6 - Pittsburgh 4-4-0, acq used 1915, scrapped 1928 The railroad also owned four passenger cars and about eight freight cars during its life. The railroad constructed a six-wheel gas-electric boxcab locomotive on top of a Pullman passenger car truck in 1903. While it proved too under-powered to pull more than a single car and was destroyed in a fire after only a few months, it is notable as possibly the first internal-combustion locomotive of any kind to see revenue service in North America. Structures=Macomb The original depot at Macomb was located at the corner of Jackson and Johnson Streets and was located in the front room of a blacksmith shop. It is believed that this was abandoned when the tracks on Johnson were torn up in 1908. Thereafter the Burlington depot was used, although the MI&L; may have had a separate office on the north side of the tracks during the 1920s. Structures at the Macomb Yards included a one-stall engine house, a water tank and a tool shed. The original engine house burned down in December 1904 but it was rebuilt. Industry The Industry depot was a small frame structure erected in 1904. Other structures at Industry included a water tower and tool shed built the same year, a stock yard, and an elevator. These structures were all located directly to the west of First Street. Littleton The original Littleton depot was a frame structure built in the \\"Pagoda\\" style. It was torn down or relocated by Chicago House Wrecking in 1914, and was replaced the following year by a concrete block depot located on the south side of Broadway. Railroad facilities at Littleton also included a stock yard and elevator located north of Broadway as well as a one-stall engine house located at the wye on the southwest side of town. During the railroad's early years there was also a mine superstructure located astride the wye that was used to load coal cars. Intermediate locations During the MI&L; years there were waiting shelters located at Andrews, Kirkpatrick and Runkle. The Kirkpatrick shelter actually consisted of an old coach body while the others were corrugated metal structures. There were stock yards at Andrews, Kirkpatrick and Runkle, as well as an elevator at Kirkpatrick. Other structures may have existed at some of these locations at certain times. Remaining traces Portions of the original roadbed, right-of-way and bridge approaches can still be found parallel (west side) to South Johnson Road, also known locally as the St. Francis blacktop (named for a former Catholic hospital, which closed in 1970, in southwest Macomb). The grade embankment and roadbed just southwest of the old St. Francis Hospital property is still in place. This is where the route turned northwest for its eventual interchange with the Burlington (CB&Q;). Another embankment on either side of Grindstone Creek on the northwest side of Industry is still in evidence. A sizeable concrete culvert over Sugar Creek on the north side of Littleton is still there, and the embankment at that location is used for an access road. The Littleton depot was intact until destroyed by a tornado in 1981.

Known as the Smoky Cape Lighthouse it was built from concrete and local granite aggregate in an octagonal shape at the highest point on the cape. Smoky Cape  Fish Rock  Fish Rock is a small bare rock which juts out of the sea just south-east of the cape. It's a noted scuba diving location and home to various fish species. A 120-metre cave runs right under the rock and there are various gutters nearby where Grey Nurse Sharks live. The area is one of about a dozen in New South Wales recognised as critical for the shark, and for that reason fishing is restricted, but the grey nurse is still affected by fishing. The only restrictions are anchoring within 100m and bottom fishing, however boats are still allowed to drift up as close as they want and drop their lines. Fisheries have also been reported to have only been seen at Fish Rock twice in the past 6 years.  Green Island  Green Island is a small island close to the coast just north of the cape. It too is a critical habitat area for the Grey Nurse Shark.

Originally a subaltern officer of the imperial guard regiment (tagma) of the Vigla, it was associated with the command over the famed Varangian Guard in the 11th–12th centuries.  History  The title is first attested in the late 9th century, when the Kletorologion of 899 lists him as one of the senior officers of the Vigla or Arithmos guard regiment (tagma). In the 9th–10th centuries, the akolouthos (often termed , akolouthos tou arithmou, to emphasize his links to the Vigla/Arithmos) was the deputy of the regimental commander, the droungarios tes vigles, i.e. the equivalent of the proximos and the protomandator in the two senior tagmata, the Scholai and the Excubitores. Already at this time, however, he was associated with the command of the foreign mercenaries, chiefly the Franks. Varangian Guardsmen, an illumination from the Madrid Skylitzes From the early 11th century, the droungarios tes vigles was entrusted with judicial and police duties in the capital, Constantinople, and the post of akolouthos became an independent command, still linked to mercenary contingents, now chiefly the Varangian Guard, which from the Komnenian period on became one of the main, and most enduring, corps of the imperial bodyguard. In the 12th century however, the akolouthoi are mentioned chiefly in connection with diplomatic missions. The akolouthos is still named as the chief of the Varangians in the mid-14th century Book of Offices of pseudo-Kodinos, but the last attested holder of the post is a certain John Nomikopoulos in 1199. The historian Rodolphe Guilland however considered it very likely that the post continued to exist until the end of the empire, even though no holders are named. According to pseudo- Kodinos, he occupied the 51st place in the palace hierarchy, was always in close attendance to the emperor, and assisted by the \\"primikerioi of the Varangians\\". The same work also gives his distinctive court dress: a skiadion hat with gold-wire embroidery, a \\"plain silk\\" kabbadion kaftan, and a ceremonial hat called skaranikon, covered with velvet and topped with a red tassel. In the breakaway Empire of Trebizond (1204–1461), the akolouthos was also known as chourtzes (χουρτζής), a title of unknown origin; it is possibly linked to similar Persian or Georgian titles signifying \\"page\\".  Known holders  A few akolouthoi are recorded by name in the sources. A patrikios Michael served as akolouthos under Constantine IX Monomachos (), and was active as a general against the Pechenegs and the Seljuk Turks. A certain Nampites occupied the post early in the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (). Under Manuel I Komnenos (), the akolouthos Stephen was sent by the emperor to accompany and guide Conrad III of Germany while crossing Byzantine territory during the Second Crusade (1147). In ca. 1160/61, the post was held by Basil Kamateros, and a little later by Isaac Aaron, who betrayed the emperor's confidence and was blinded in 1171. The last known holder of the office, John Nomikopoulos, is attested in a chrysobull of Alexios III Angelos () from 1199. A handful of seals of akolouthoi are also known, but they cannot be dated or identified with any certainty.

It was directed by Guido Pieters and produced by Rob Houwer. The title translates as \\"The fury/rage/raging of the whole world\\" and is derived from a song with lyrics by René-François Sully-Prudhomme, set to music by Gabriel Fauré. Film plot The film is set in Maassluis and Leiden, in the time of the German occupation (see The Netherlands in World War II) in the 1940s, and in the 1950s. It is about the coming of age of Alex Goudveyl (Maarten Heijmans), and about a murder. For profit, in May 1940 Joost Vroom (Cees Geel) takes refugees (mainly Jews) on his boat to escape to England. However, the boat is attacked by the Germans. They survive, but the escape fails and the boat and the money is lost. The Goudveyl couple has a business of second-hand goods, and profits from the persecution of Jews by cheaply buying goods of Jews who have to flee the country. Vroom becomes police officer, first under the German occupation. He betrays Jews for profit, to recover his loss on the boat. After the war he remains police officer. Alex loves playing piano, and is very talented. Very inconsiderately his father sells the family's piano when he is offered a good price for it, much to Alex's regret. Sometimes Alex can play piano or organ elsewhere. Vroom is ephebophile and, for example, pays Alex for simulating masturbation with an eel between his legs substituting for his penis, so that Vroom can film it (in the book Vroom pays for seeing and touching boys' penises; the film's variation may have been chosen to allow visualisation, while keeping it decent). Alex has a gay friend William Keenids, who sometimes likes to cross- dress. We see a scene where William is in Vroom's home, with the little film of Alex being projected on a screen, and William willingly starting to undress while Vroom is filming. It is not revealed whether this is for money. In another scene, William tries to have some physical intimacy with Alex, but Alex rejects it, arguing that he is not Vroom. Aaron Oberstein's wife died in the war. He does not know what happened to his baby son. In 1956 Vroom claims he knows who and where he is and offers to tell it for a large sum of money. Aaron brings the money at the agreed place, the warehouse of the Goudveyls. An evangelisation campaign is going on outside, while Alex plays the piano inside. Vroom is murdered by a gunshot. Alex is witness of the murder, and is afraid he will be killed later because of that. As a student, Alex has sex with Yvonne, assistant of the professor, in an empty lecture room, at her initiative. At first Alex is willing, but when she wants more he walks away. On a second occasion, when he has Joanna Oberstein as girlfriend, he refuses sex with Yvonne. Now she threatens him with a knife. Then her boss enters the room and Alex can escape. Yvonne is fired. Alex's parents confess to Alex that in the war they could buy their business cheaply, because the owners were deported Jews. The parents say there is another important thing to tell, but they hesitate and do not tell it yet. Soon after this, Alex's parents die of carbon monoxide poisoning. It turns out that Alex's parents were not his biological parents. His biological mother died in the war, his biological father is Aaron Oberstein, the father of Alex's girlfriend.

It is a robot that dispenses a selected quantity of reagent, samples or other liquid to a designated container.  Introduction  Liquid handling plays a pivotal role in life science laboratories. The sample volumes are usually small, at the micro- or nanoliter level, and the number of transferred samples can be huge. Under these conditions, liquid handling by hand is tedious, time- consuming, and impractical. Consequently, there is a strong demand for automated liquid handling robots.  Types of liquid handling robots  The simplest version simply dispenses an allotted volume of liquid from a motorized pipette or syringe; more complicated machines can also manipulate the position of the dispensers and containers (often a Cartesian coordinate robot) and/or integrate additional laboratory devices, such as centrifuges, microplate readers, heat sealers, heater/shakers, bar code readers, spectrophotometric devices, storage devices and incubators. More complex liquid handling workstations can perform multiple Laboratory Unit Operations such as sample transport, sample mixing, manipulation and incubation, as well as transporting vessels to/from other workstations. They can range from a specialized bench-top 8-channel DNA PCR processing robot, to a customized-for- process automated liquid handling system, such as the TECAN Freedom EVO (shown on the right), the HighRes Biosolution's PRIME and Janus Automated liquid handlers from PerkinElmer. Other liquid handling systems are designed for specific experiments, e.g. the Intavis InsituPro robot for the automation of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on whole-mounts and slides. An alternative category of liquid handlers mimics the operations of humans, by performing liquid transfers as humans would do. These robots achieve the cartesian, 3-axis movements implemented in larger workstations, by means of an arm. In some cases (like the \\"Andrew\\" system or ASSIST PLUS robot shown on the right) they can even use the same pipettes and consumables as humans.  Modularity  Liquid handling robots can be customized using different add-on modules such as centrifuges, PCR machines, colony pickers, shaking modules, heating modules and others. Some liquid handling robots utilize Acoustic Liquid Handling (also known as acoustic droplet ejection or ADE) which uses sound to move liquids without the traditional pipette or syringe.  Control Software  Control software, either on a connected computer, or integrated into the system itself, allows the user to customize the liquid handling procedures and transfer volumes.  Quality Control  One of the challenges in using automated liquid handlers, or liquid handling robots, is in verifying the proper function of the device. Liquid handling operations, performed by these automated systems, can fail due to clogged pipette tips, failed solenoid valves, damaged labware, operator error and many other reasons. A variety of methods exist for performing quality control of liquid dispensing on automated platforms including gravimetric, fluorescent and colorimetric measurements. In addition to manual quality control methods, technologies have been developed which allow for the automated monitoring of quality control of liquid handling robots.

He is perhaps most famous for penning the lyrics to the well known hymn, \\"All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name\\".  Early life and education  Born in Sundridge, Kent, England, Perronet was the son of Vincent Perronet, and a descendant of a French Huguenot family which fled first to Switzerland and then to England to escape religious persecution.  Preaching  At the time, persecution of Methodists was common. John Wesley once noted in his diary that Edward himself \\"was thrown down and rolled in mud and mire\\" at Bolton. Though considered a capable preacher, Perronet was uneasy about doing so in front of John Wesley, despite Wesley's persistent urging. After wearying of his requests, Wesley simply announced one day that Brother Perronet would speak. Edward cleverly managed to escape Wesley's intention by mounting the pulpit, declaring he would deliver the greatest sermon ever preached, and proceeding to read Christ's \\"Sermon on the Mount\\"; after which, he immediately sat down. Following worsening relations with the Wesleys, Perronet published The Mitre in 1756, a ferocious attack in verse on the Church of England and the notion that the Eucharist was a priestly rite only to be properly administered in England by Anglican priests. This provoked a schism with the Wesleys and Perronet's connection with organized Methodism came to an end. He preached in the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion until his open aversion to the established church led to his becoming the minister of an Independent congregation.  Writings  During his life, Edward published three volumes of Christian poems, including a poetic rendering of the Scriptures. Shortly before he died, 2 January 1792 in Canterbury, Kent, England, he uttered these last words: \\"Glory to God in the height of His divinity! Glory to God in the depth of his humanity! Glory to God in His all-sufficiency! Into His hands I commend my spirit.\\"P.77 of Then Sings My Soul Special Edition by Robert Morgan. 2003 Legacy  Perronet's legacy lives on as Christian communities continue to sing what has come to be known as the \\"National Anthem of Christianity\\" in churches around the world... \\"All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name\\". Several of his hymns are also preserved in the Sacred Harp. His body is buried in Canterbury Cathedral, Kent, England.

It sells natural and organic food that the company claimed to have the highest product standards in the United States (free of various artificial additives, high-fructose corn syrup, hormones and antibiotics), and was one of the largest natural and organic food retailers in the country. After closing all stores in February 2020, three locations reopened in June 2020 and a total of 9 locations operate as of September 2020.  History  Earth Fare in Williamsburg, Virginia during its liquidation sale. Founded by Roger Derrough in 1975, the first store opened its doors in Asheville, North Carolina as “Dinner for the Earth”. Initially, Dinner for the Earth offered only organic dried bulk foods in wood barrels and wellness products on handmade shelves. With new partner Randy Talley, the store rebranded as Earth Fare in a new larger location in 1994, transitioning from a specialty store to a full-service store with expanded offerings of products, like craft beer and artisanal cheeses. Two years later, the store expanded to a second location in Charleston, South Carolina, and thereafter continued its expansion to \\"mid-sized metros, with the savvy and wealth to support a healthy supermarket and no competition in the niche.\\" Oak Hill Capital bought the chain in 2012. The company maintains a list of 140 ingredients that its products do not contain, and customers may receive $50 gift cards if they spot one of said ingredients in one of the chain's products. On February 3, 2020, Earth Fare announced that it was going out of business and liquidating all of its stores. The company cited \\"continued challenges in the retail industry\\" as a reason it could not refinance its outstanding debt, further adding that it was \\"not in a financial position to continue to operate on a go forward basis.\\" One day later, the company announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. It listed liabilities of $100 million to $500 million and assets of $100 million to $500 million. All locations closed by February 25, 2020. Products All products the store carried were free of high fructose corn syrup, artificial fats, artificial trans fats, artificial colors, artificial flavors, artificial preservatives, artificial sweeteners, bleached or bromated flour, never administered antibiotics or added growth hormones. The company claims to have the highest standard in its organic produce in North America. While it sold food from around the world, the company also operated the policy of \\"100 mile Commitment\\" to sell as much local produce as possible from within a 100-mile radius of the store. Store locations At its peak, Earth Fare operated 50 stores locations across 10 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. As of September 2020, the chain currently operates 9 locations across 4 states: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Expansion and decline Earth Fare expanded into Virginia in November 2017 with three locations in Roanoke, Fairfax, and Williamsburg. In 2019, Earth Fare had planned fifty additional stores by 2024. In 2018, Earth Fare closed two locations in Atlanta, Georgia and one location in Columbus, Ohio. Earth Fare's Gainesville, Florida location closed on January 11, 2020. Reopening Just four months after shuttering the entire chain, an investment from Hulsing Enterprises of Asheville, North Carolina and its CEO Dennis Hulsing helped the original Earth Fare founders Randy Talley and Mike Cianciarulo, to revive the brand and begin to reopen certain locations. First to reopen was the Westgate Earth Fare in Asheville on June 22. The second and third locations to reopen are in Roanoke, Virginia and Boone, North Carolina with five other locations earmarked to resume operations in Athens, Georgia, Summerville, South Carolina, and Rock Hill, South Carolina. Most of the other former Earth Fare locations in the Southeastern U.S. were sold to other retailers during the bankruptcy proceedings earlier in 2020. The chain also announced its first completely new location—as opposed to a reopening of a shuttered location—will open in early 2021 in Christiansburg, Virginia.

Council members consist of private companies with business interests in Taiwan, and range in size from one-person consulting firms to large multinational corporations. Because the organization reflects the views and concerns of an extensive group of U.S. businesses, the Council is generally considered to be one of the most influential private organizations playing a part in the unofficial relationship between the two economies. The organization is particularly well known in the Defense & Security community, as it is the host of an annual US-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference. The inaugural conference in St. Petersburg, Florida in 2002 brought Taiwan's Minister of National Defense to the U.S. for the first time since 1979. Mandate The mission of the US-Taiwan Business Council – as defined in its bylaws – is to develop private economic, commercial and financial relationships, to foster investment, trade, and commerce between the United States and Taiwan. Services The organization provides a variety of services to its members, including: Consulting Tactical and strategic business advice to companies looking to get established, or to expand, in the Taiwan market. Advocacy work – on behalf of individual companies or on behalf of groups of members – can range from dealing with market access issues and equipment sales, to resolving contractual difficulties or attempting to change Taiwan government policies. eBulletins Weekly email bulletins examine recent US-Taiwan-China business, economic, and political developments. Issues covered include General Business, Finance & Banking, Defense & Security, Semiconductors, PCs, Intellectual property, and Biotechnology, among others. Analysis reports The Council occasionally publishes reports providing up-to-date analysis on events and developments that affect businesses operating within the triangular U.S.-Taiwan-China relationship. These papers and statements, which include editorials and research reports, are distributed to members when situations warrant. Events The Council holds conferences, seminars, receptions, and other events throughout the U.S. and Taiwan each year. The two largest events are the annual US-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference (美台國防工業會議) and the Taiwan + China Semiconductor Industry Conference. Tang Yiau-ming, Taiwan's Minister of National Defense, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly attended the 2002 Defense Industry Conference in St. Petersburg, Florida. Taiwan Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min attended the 2008 Defense Industry Conference on Amelia Island, Florida. Relationship building The organization cultivates an extensive network of contacts and relationships within the U.S. and Taiwan governments, as well as within the private sector and among non-government organizations with an interest in Taiwan. Both the United States Congress and the Executive Branch frequently call upon the organization to express its views on the US-Taiwan business relationship. Organizational structure Chairman Executive Committee Board of Directors President Vice President Staff in functional departments Current staff Chairman: Michael R. Splinter President: Rupert Hammond-Chambers Vice President: Lotta Danielsson History=1970s In 1976, David M. Kennedy formed the organization in Chicago, Illinois as the “USA-ROC Economic Council.” For the next 14 years he served as Chairman of the organization and helped guide its development. William Morell was elected President the same year. The organization quickly got involved with the commercial and political spheres in both the United States and Taiwan, and it played an important role in the drafting and passing of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) in 1979, the legislation that guides US-Taiwan relations in lieu of official diplomatic recognition. 1980s The 1980s brought the Council an expanded membership base and deeper ties with business and political leaders in Taiwan. Since U.S. diplomatic recognition had been transferred from Taipei to Beijing, the Council took on greater importance as it continued to work towards strengthening trade and communications with Taiwan on behalf of American companies. 1990s In 1990, Caspar Weinberger (\\"Cap\\") succeeded David Kennedy as Chairman of the organization and David Laux was elected to take the place of outgoing President William Morell. The change in leadership also brought with it a change in venue, as the Council relocated its office from Chicago to Washington, D.C. In 1991, the Council formed its “Chairman’s Circle,” a group of member companies with heavily vested business interests in Taiwan. In 1995, Dan Tellep was elected Chairman as Caspar Weinberger rotated out of the post. Soon afterwards the “USA-ROC Economic Council” changed its name to the “US-ROC (Taiwan) Business Council.” William P. Clark was elected Chairman in January 1997. Later that year, Senators Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska and John D. Rockefeller, IV of West Virginia became Honorary Co- chairmen. The Council also moved once more to Arlington, Virginia to share a floor with the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the entity that – under contract to the U.S. State Department – manages America’s unofficial relationship with the island. Frank C. Carlucci replaced William Clark as Chairman of the organization in 1999. 2000s In 2000, David Laux stepped down and Rupert Hammond-Chambers was elected as the youngest-ever president. In 2001, the name of the organization was again changed to “US-Taiwan Business Council.” In 2003, William Cohen was elected as chairman, and Senator Conrad Burns of Montana took the place of Frank Murkowski as honorary co-chairman. In 2005, the council gained new leadership with the election of Senator William Brock to the chairmanship and Vance D. Coffman to the position of vice chairman. In 2007, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska took over the honorary co- chairman seat vacated by Conrad Burns. In 2008, Paul D. Wolfowitz joined the council as its chairman, succeeding Bill Brock. 2010s In 2016, Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey took over the honorary co-chairman seat vacated by Jay Rockefeller, who had held the post since 1997. In 2018, Michael R. Splinter joined the council as its chairman, succeeding Paul D. Wolfowitz. Miscellaneous The council is incorporated in the District of Columbia and is designated by the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. The council's \\"sister organization\\" in Taiwan is the ROC-USA Business Council. During the 1980s and 1990s, the two organizations co-hosted conferences – called \\"Annual Joint Business Conferences\\" – which were held on alternate years in either Taiwan or the US. The conferences served as opportunities for high-level bilateral dialogue, and often brought United States Cabinet officers to Taiwan. This tradition ended in 2004.

In his memoirs published in 1993, the writer Tô Hoài confirmed that Xuân Diệu was reprimanded while in the Viet Minh for molesting other men in bed. Works Throughout his career, Xuân Diệu had been variously known as a romantic poet, \\"the greatest poet among the new poets\\", and \\"the king of love poems\\" (he himself gave Hồ Xuân Hương the sobriquet \\"the Queen of Nôm poetry\\"). He was a member of the literary movement Tự Lực Văn Đoàn (Self-Reliance Literary Movement) and one of the leaders of the Thơ Mới (New Poetry) movement. Representative works he wrote during this period include: Thơ Thơ (Poetry poem, 1938), Gửi Hương Cho Gió (Perfume Flies with the Wind, 1945), and the short story Phấn Thông Vàng (Golden Pine Pollen, 1939). His poetry collections Thơ thơ and Gửi hương cho gió are regarded as his masterpieces. They glorify love, life, happiness, and love of life. By that, he also glorified youth, spring, and nature as the cradle for love. He also grieved for the passing of time, the precariousness of life and showed thirst for everlasting life.

Opened on 31 December 1966 as the final part of the Zhdanovskiy Radius, the station was the southeastern terminus of the line until 9 November 2013, when the extension to Lermontovsky Prospekt and Zhulebino was opened. The metro station is part of a multi-modal transfer hub, which also consists of the mainline suburban railway (Kazanskoye direction). Originally, the station (as well as the line) was called Zhdanovskaya after Soviet revolutionary and politician Andrei Zhdanov. However, in 1988 the station was renamed for the village of Vykhino that was absorbed by Moscow in 1960. History Originally designed by A. Strelkov and V. Cheremin, the whole complex has four platforms, two of which are island platforms. The railway uses four out of the six tracks, while the metro uses the other two. It is the only station where is impossible to get from one platform to another without leaving the metro. Two pedestrian subways exist for the transfer between platforms (the transfer complex is above ground level and passengers must ascend to get onto the platforms). Direct railway to metro connections is only possible from Moscow- bound mainline trains onto centre-bound metro trains, where the combined platform is divided lengthwise between the metro and the railway. To transfer in the opposite direction, the subways must be used. When the transfer complex was built, the long-term passenger load was underestimated. As a result, Vykhino became the busiest and most crowded station of the metro system, due to its position at the edge of Moscow, near many highly populated areas of the hinterland. In addition to the railway traffic, Vykhino also has a large bus station nearby and many passengers from the surrounding Moscow Oblast travel to central Moscow via Vykhino. As a result, the station has some of the largest passenger numbers of the metro network — 176,629 passengers per day at the start of 2009. On the morning rush hour, each third train does not board at this and following Ryazansky Prospekt stations to pick up passengers at station with good bus service. Initially, the railway commuter passenger trains stopped just outside the metro pavilion. However, since the early 1990s, they have been making longer journeys well beyond the metro trains' arrival zone, and most of the passengers were forced to walk a train length. By the early 2000s, it was clear that the transfer point needed a significant reconstruction. In 2004 the station was closed to mainline trains (passengers were told to use the Kazansky railway station instead). During this time the old 1960s concrete hinged roofs on the railway platforms were knocked down. These were replaced with modern light green and white transparent roofs with decorative features. The stairwells from the subways were covered with separate pavilions where turnstiles were inserted, and the concrete floor was repaved with stone. The combined metro and railway platform were re-divided along the width where a pavilion was built. Thus the centre-bound metro platform was nearly trebled in area (accounting for the dismantled ticket offices as well), and safety walls were installed on the railway side. The metro part of the station kept its hinged roofs, but these were wholly repainted, and the crude lighting elements in the hinges were replaced with newer ones so giving the platform a cleaner look. The subways were also widened and cleaned up with the old tile work replaced by marble. Additional subway was built as well. The complex was re-opened to the public on 2 October 2004. Behind the station is a surface cross junction used for reversal and the tracks lead on to the Vykhino depot.

It is the capital of Włoszczowa County. Population is 10,756 (2004). Włoszczowa lies in historic Lesser Poland, and from its foundation until 1795 (see Partitions of Poland), it belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship. The town has the area of 30 sq km (11 sq miles), and is a junction of regional roads nr 786, nr 742, and 785. Włoszczowa has two rail stations: PKP Włoszczowa (on the Kielce - Częstochowa route), and PKP Włoszczowa Północ (Włoszczowa North) (on the Central Rail Line). Włoszczowa was first mentioned in 1154, when Prince Henryk Sandomierski handed the village known then as Vloszcova to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta monks. It received its town charter in 1539, when King Zygmunt Stary handed the document to the starosta of Chęciny, Hieronim Szafraniec. The town remained the property of the Szafraniec family until the late 18th century. In the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, Włoszczowa was part of Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship. After the Partitions of Poland, it belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland (1815 - 1918). In the Second Polish Republic, Włoszczowa belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. It had a large Jewish population, which made 50% of its population in 1925. Almost all Włoszczowa’s Jews were murdered by the Germans in the Holocaust. Among points of interest there are remains of a 12th-century gord, with traces of a moat, and ruins of the Szafraniec family castle (16th century). Furthermore, there is a 17th-century parish church, and the 16th-century urban layout of the streets.

Author of two important textbooks in rheology (Elastic Liquids and Body Tensor Fields in Continuum Mechanics) he was one of the founding members of the Rheology Research Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, USA. Lodge was born in Liverpool and received his bachelor's degree in Mathematics (1945) and DPhil in Theoretical Nuclear Physics (1948) from Oxford University.Tanner, R.I. & Walters, K. (1998) Rheology: An Historical Perspective, Elsevier Science Ltd., , pp. 98-99 In 1949, he took a position at the British Rayon Research Association, where his supervisor was Karl Weissenberg, inventor of the Weissenberg rheogoniometer. In 1961, Lodge joined the faculty of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST). In 1964, Lodge authored the text Elastic Liquids (Academic Press), and spent the academic year 1965–1966 in Madison, Wisconsin, USA as a visiting professor; in 1968 the Lodge family moved to Madison permanently. On his arrival at UW–Madison, Lodge and colleagues Bob Bird, John Ferry, John Schrag, and Millard Johnson founded the Rheology Research Center (RRC). Lodge chaired the RRC Executive Committee for 23 years until his retirement in 1991. Elastic Liquids introduced the Lodge rubberlike liquid constitutive equation, the foundation for contemporary nonlinear viscoelasticity. The Lodge rubberlike liquid managed to explain most of what could be reliably measured at the time (other than non-constant shear viscosity) and also anticipated nonlinear behavior not reliably measured until years later, such as the Lodge-Meissner relation. In 1974, Lodge followed up Elastic Liquids with his second text, Body Tensor Fields in Continuum Mechanics (Academic Press, 1974). Lodge was an inventor and entrepreneur, designing and marketing the on-line Lodge Stressmeter, a device for making accurate measurements of shear normal stress differences using pressure-driven slit flow. Honours Lodge was awarded the Society of Rheology Bingham Medal in 1971 and the Gold Medal of the British Society of Rheology in 1983. In 1992, he was elected to membership in the United States National Academy of Engineering.

The plane took off from Batajnica Air Base in Belgrade and was en route to Sarajevo when it crashed, ostensibly due to poor weather conditions. Conspiracy theorists have suggested that the crash was not an accident but rather the result of foul play at the hands of his rivals.

It produces cask ales and owns over 170 tenanted pubs, mainly around the Leicestershire area. Its chairman is fifth generation Richard Everard. History The company began as Hull and Everard in 1849 when William Everard, a farmer from Narborough Wood House and brewer Thomas Hull leased the Southgate Street Brewery of Wilmot and Co from the retiring proprietors. Although Hull continued as a maltster, Everard was the driving force behind the business which he managed until his death in 1892. The business expanded as the company progressively acquired outlets, with over 100 pubs by the late 1880s. In 1875, the company moved to a new state of the art tower brewery designed by William's nephew architect John Breedon Everard. The brewery, on the corner of Southgate St and Castle St extracted very pure water from wells 300 feet deep beneath the premises and steam engines played a significant part in the mechanisation. New Everards brewery on the corner of Southgate St and Castle St built in 1875 Stamford Arms Groby, Home of Thomas Everard's grandfather and great grandfather which became part of the estate in 1921 After the death of William, control passed to his son Thomas. The historic centre of the UK brewing industry remained some 40 miles away at Burton-upon-Trent, which by the 1890s produced one tenth of Britain's beer. Everard's leased the Bridge Brewery on Umplett Green island in 1895 but its 10,000 barrels per year capacity proved insufficient. It was replaced with the newer Trent brewery in Dale St which became available after going into liquidation in 1898. The Southgate brewery remained the distribution centre to the Leicestershire pubs with beer arriving by rail from Burton. The Trent brewery was purchased outright in 1901.(sources differ) It was renamed the Tiger Brewery around 1970. Beer production was seriously affected by World War I, both due to recruitment and the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 which required beer to be diluted, restricted opening times and rationed raw materials. Around 1920Sources differ as to the date Everards bought wine and spirit merchants John Sarsons & Son of Hotel St, Leicester, a major supplier to wealthy homes. Thomas moved his family from Narborough Wood House to Nanpantan Hall. In 1909 he opened a cattle trough in Groby on behalf of the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association. and in 1921, a year which saw beer production peak at 55,000 barrels, the company acquired the Stamford Arms in Groby, the former home of both Thomas's grandfather, Richard Everard a yeoman tenant farmer of the Grey estate and his great grandfather. In 1924, the company completed its move away from rail transport to steam powered drays which continued in use until replaced by petrol lorries in 1946. Thomas died in 1925 and was succeeded by his son William Lindsay Everard who lived in Ratcliffe Hall. The Great Depression saw a penny tax on beer. Production fell by a fifth and took five years to recover and all brewing ceased at Southgate in 1931. Everards became a public company, Everards Brewery Ltd. in October 1936. Following the outbreak of World War II, the Government increased excise duty tripling the price of a pint by the end of the war. A combination of conscription and a shortage of hops reduced the Leicester operation at times to 3 men. Following Sir Lindsay's death in 1949, his son Tony Everard, who had been wounded in Normandy in 1944, took over. In the 1950s he developed the concept of \\"Everards Friendly Inns\\" designed to \\"look like your front room\\" which succeeded in attracting women into what was traditionally a male preserve. In November 1950 the first long service awards were made at a dinner to found the Quarter Century club. Although pubs rarely came onto the market, the demolition of a number of older ones during construction of the Leicester inner ringroad in the sixties allowed the company to build new ones such as the Shakespeare in Braunstone and the Firs at Wigston. In 1967 the company employed almost 700 staff and operated 125 pubs. Like his father Tony had a keen interest in aviation and in 1966 he founded the Helicopter Club of Great Britain and opened a heliport at Ratcliffe. The Airman's Rest hotel in Leicester Forest East was designed to welcome fliers and equipped with a heliport. In 1979 the company bought 54 hectares at Grove Farm triangle and phase I of the new brewery -named Castle acres after the Castle street premises – was opened on 29 March 1985 by local MP Nigel Lawson. It had a capacity of 125 barrels of Old Original per year. The Tiger brewery in Burton became a museum though it continued to produce Tiger under contract. By 1990, Castle Acres was producing nearly 70,000 barrels, the contract with the museum ended and for the first time since 1892, all Everards beer was brewed in Leicester. In 1988 Richard Everard, nephew of Tony, became chairman. He confirmed that Everards would remain an independent family business and in 1997 it repurchased its remaining preference shares to become a private business again. The company also invested in budget hotels, named 'Original Inns' based around existing pubs. In February 1999, the company celebrated its first 150 years with a visit from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Celebrations, perhaps as befitting a brewery, \\"continued throughout the year,\\" and included the pubs. The 'Founders day' saw Richard Everard presented with a bronze figure of a tiger sculpted by Mark Coreth. In 2002, the company decided to switch its portfolio from a mixture of tenancies and managed houses to tenancies only. This led to new pubs replacing hotels and the estate achieved its highest total of 165 by 2005.

Prior to August 2011, the station was broadcast at 900 AM before moving to 101.7 FM. History Originally owned by Amherst Broadcasting Co., the station began broadcasting in 1957 at 1400 AM, before moving to 900 AM in 1965 and to 101.7 FM as of 2011. Over the years, CKDH has gone through different ownerships and formats. CKDH received CRTC approval on April 24, 2009.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-220 CKDH Amherst – Conversion to FM band to move from 900 AM to 101.7 FM, which took effect on July 21, 2011. A radio station repeater, CJSE-FM-1 out of Memramcook, New Brunswick received CRTC approval to move from 101.7 MHz to another FM frequency on April 13, 2010 to prevent co-channel interference with CKDH after its move to FM. On June 17, 2011, Maritime Broadcasting System received approval from the CRTC to increase CKDH-FM's average ERP from 18,700 to 23,000 watts, by decreasing the effective height of antenna above average terrain from 32 to 16 meters and by relocating its transmitter.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-380 FM launch On July 21, 2011, CKDH began testing at 101.7 FM. On August 12, 2011 at 9:00 a.m., CKDH officially flipped to FM. The AM 900 signal which simulcasted the programs from 101.7 FM was shut down by the end of 2011. The new FM station will continue to air its existing adult contemporary format. On August 12, 2011, the station officially launched as 101.7 CKDH with the first song being Pink's \\"Get the Party Started\\", following the transition to FM, the station continued to air an adult contemporary format. On November 17, 2011, the plug was pulled on the AM 900 signal in Amherst after the 90-day authorized simulcast period expired for their flip to 101.7 FM. Programming will continue on the new 101.7 FM. In August 2013, CKDH-FM changed its format from adult contemporary to country music. 48 Hours for Haiti Moved by the devastation in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, host Dave March made a pledge to go on the air for 48 hours straight to raise money for the Red Cross and their efforts in Haiti. March stayed on the air for almost 50 hours, raising more than $20,000 for the Canadian Red Cross.The Citizen Record - Amherst Daily News Notable personalities * Ian Hanomansing * Mike Duffy ReferencesExternal links * 101.7 CKDH * Facebook Page * * (FM 101.7 MHz) Kdh Kdh Category:Amherst, Nova Scotia Kdh Category:Radio stations established in 1957 Category:1957 establishments in Nova Scotia ","title":"CKDH-FM"},{"id":"4417121","text":"Television news music is used by television stations to brand their news operations. Each television station uses an identifiable news theme; some themes are used by multiple stations while others are composed specifically for a certain station. In the United States In the United States, news themes used on local television stations are typically organized into news music packages, with each theme within a package sharing a similar musical signature. A typical television news music package consists of anywhere from 50 to as many as 1000 cuts of music. One of the largest news music packages is Overture, created by Stephen Arnold Music. This package consists of a total of 36 themes and over 1000 cuts. News music packages consist of the following: opens, closes, bumpers, topicals (promo beds), franchise opens/stingers, IDs, utility tracks and billboards. *Opens: These are the cuts used to begin a newscast, usually accompanied by a vamp straight out of the open (either a stripped or full version of the bumper.) In a news package, opens come in short credit forms (for the main open) and long credit forms (for talent opens.) Some packages even include different lengths of the talent opens for three- or four—anchor lineups. *Closes: Closes also come in different formats and lengths, many of which are similar in sound to that package's open. Usually, there are 60-, 30-, 20-, 15-, and 10-second versions of the close, designed to resolve at a precise time. *Bumpers: These are used primarily before the main open and teasing out to the next segment of a newscast. When the bumper is played, a summary of what will air in the upcoming newscast or later in the newscast will be shown. *Topicals/promo beds: These are the cuts of music used only in promos for a specific upcoming newscast. Topicals come in four types: theme donut/theme donut open beds, ID/promo beds, end theme news open/promo beds, and ID/stingers. These usually correspond with regular promo times (:30, :20, :10, and :05 ID.) *Franchise opens/stingers: Franchise opens or stingers are used to open various segments of a newscast in-show (breaking news, special reports, sports, weather, investigation, etc.) *IDs: This is a short package signature used to identify the television station. It can also be used in conjunction to identify talent. The Federal Communications Commission requires several over-the-air (OTA) stations (including radio stations) to identify themselves at regular intervals by either stating their call letters or brand name (sometimes known, particularly in the United States, as a \\"sounder\\" or \\"stinger\\", more generally as a station or network ident). Also, an ID can signify a network affiliation such as the NBC chimes or the drum rolling intro to the 20th Century Fanfare. *Utility tracks *Billboards Stations within the same market area will always use different music packages, unless they are related to each other in some manner; e.g., if two stations may be owned by the same company (or operated by the same company under a local marketing agreement (LMA), or one station may contract out its news production to the other. For example: in Ft. Myers, Florida, ABC affiliate WZVN-TV is owned by Montclair Communications, Inc., while NBC affiliate WBBH-TV in the same market is owned by Waterman Broadcasting Corporation, which operates WZVN under an LMA. That said, both stations currently use This is Your News by Gari Communications. In newscasts airing on WZVN, NBC network ID stingers can be heard in the news opens, even though WZVN-TV is an ABC affiliate. A case where the opposite of the aforementioned is true is in Denver, Colorado, Fox affiliate KDVR and CW affiliate KWGN are owned by Tribune Media. Custom news music packages Some news music packages are custom made for one station only, as opposed to syndicated packages which are used by multiple stations. While syndicated packages are normal in the industry, there are some stations that still use custom made packages. Such examples include: *KDVR, Colorado ** News Music Package Composed by Alan Koshiyama (2011–2017) *KWGN, Colorado ** News Music Package Composed by Alan Koshiyama (2011–2016) *WLS-TV, Chicago ** News Series 2000 Plus (1992–present) *KFOR-TV, Oklahoma City ** Newsmusic Central's KFOR Custom News Package (1993–1997) ** Wow and Flutter Music's KFOR-TV News Package (1997–2017) *KNBC-TV, Los Angeles **Newscenter (1979–1982) and Newscenter II (1985–1993) by Michael Randall **KNBC News Package (1982–1985) by Tuesday Productions **KNBC News (1994–1998) by Michael Boyd **L.A.

W. Scripps stations * Spirit (of Texas) by TM Communications (1984–1990s) for the Belo Corporation stations Station imaging packages Some news music packages are accompanied by a station image package, featuring promotional jingles which often share the same musical signature as the parent news music package. Often, imaging packages include jingles for the holiday and elections. Such promotional packages first came to prominence in the United States in the 1970s, and had become widespread by the 1980s, used by many (though not all) television stations. Many memorable packages, such as Frank Gari's \\"Hello\\" and \\"Turn to...\\", were composed during this era, and some were even used on stations in some other countries and in languages other than English. Station image packages are designed to give a positive branding method for broadcast television stations. Many such packages from the 1970s and 1980s often portrayed stations in a community-oriented light, accompanied by footages of the stations' personalities participating in recreational activities and charity events with regular everyday people. By the 1990s, many stations had adopted a more hard- hitting approach to branding, resulting in a reduced demand for traditional promotion campaigns. However, a few stations which used Gari's Hello campaign briefly re-introduced it in the 2000s as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations. News music adopted from other sources Besides standard news music packages, some stations had opted to use the soundtrack from some movies or other popular songs as their main news themes; examples include: *Cool Hand Luke \\"The Tar Sequence\\" by Lalo Schifrin (later gave rise to News Series 2000 by Frank Gari) *\\"Classical Gas\\" by Mason Williams (later gave rise to an identically-named news theme by Telesound ) *\\"Do You Know the Way to San Jose,\\" used by KNTV in San Jose, California in the 1980s and early 1990s. *\\"Gonna Fly Now\\" (version by Maynard Ferguson), used most famously by Citytv Toronto in the 1970s *The Happening \\"The Fuzz\\" by Frank De Vol used by Rede Globo, in Brazil, in the Jornal Nacional *Group W's Eyewitness News format at KYW, WBZ, and WJZ once used 007 from the From Russia With Love film soundtrack. *Al Caiola's version of Elmer Bernstein's main theme for The Magnificent Seven. *WGCL-TV in Atlanta, Georgia used a news theme based on Johnny Nash's \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" from 2001 to 2002 as part of its \\"Clear TV\\" branding. *\\"MacArthur Park\\" by Richard Harris and adapted by Hugo Montenegro was used by Cleveland, Ohio WJW-TV in the 1970s when they were still a CBS station and they used the City Camera News theme. *\\"Theme from Shaft\\" by Isaac Hayes used by WMC-TV in the 1970s. News music worldwide Certain News Music packages used in the United States have also been used worldwide. Eyewitness News by Frank Gari has been picked up for use in overseas markets. Hong Kong Cable News has used it for its morning newscast, and POP TV in Slovenia has used it for its main newscasts. News music in the concert hall The News in Music (Tabloid Lament) (2017) by Thomas Meadowcroft, is an orchestral work of TV news music specifically written for the concert hall. Commissioned by the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra, the work positions orchestral news music, stylistically reminiscent of TV news music cues from the 1970s and 1980s, in a live, acoustic setting.

The uranium market, like all commodity markets, has a history of volatility, moving with the standard forces of supply and demand as well as geopolitical pressures. It has also evolved particularities of its own in response to the unique nature and use of uranium. Historically, uranium has been mined in countries willing to export, including Australia and Canada. However, countries now responsible for more than 50% of the world’s uranium production include Kazakhstan, Namibia, Niger, and Uzbekistan. Uranium from mining is used almost entirely as fuel for nuclear power plants. Following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, the global uranium market remains depressed, with the uranium price falling more than 50%, declining share values, and reduced profitability of uranium producers since March 2011. As a result, uranium companies worldwide have reduced capacity, closed operations and deferred new production. Before uranium is ready for use as nuclear fuel in reactors, it must undergo a number of intermediary processing steps that are identified as the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle: mining it (either by ISL or by mining and milling into yellowcake); enriching it; and finally fuel fabrication to produce fuel assemblies or bundles. History The world's top uranium producers in 2017 with 71% of production were Kazakhstan (39% of world production), Canada (22%) and Australia (10%). Other major producers included Niger, Namibia and Russia. Initial treatment facilities to produce uranium oxide are almost always located at the mining sites. The facilities for enrichment, on the other hand, are found in those countries that produce significant amounts of electricity from nuclear power. Large commercial enrichment plants are in operation in France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, United States, and Russia, with smaller plants elsewhere. Global demand for uranium rose steadily from the end of World War II, largely driven by nuclear weapons procurement programs. This trend lasted until the early 1980s, when changing geopolitical circumstances as well as environmental, safety, economic concerns over nuclear power plants reduced demand somewhat. The production of a series of large hydro-electric power stations has also helped to depress the global market since the early 1970s. This phenomenon can be traced back to the construction of the vast Aswan Dam in Egypt. During this time, large uranium inventories accumulated. Until 1985 the Western uranium industry was producing material much faster than nuclear power plants and military programs were consuming it. Uranium prices slid throughout the decade with few respites, leaving the price below $10 per pound for yellowcake by year-end 1989. As uranium prices fell, producers began curtailing operations or exiting the business entirely, leaving only a few actively involved in uranium mining and causing uranium inventories to shrink significantly. Since 1990 uranium requirements have outstripped uranium production. World uranium requirements have increased steadily to in 2017. Several factors are pushing both industrialized and developing nations towards alternative energy sources. The increasing rate of consumption of fossil fuel is a concern for nations lacking in reserves, especially non-OPEC nations. The other issue is the level of pollution produced by coal-burning plants, and despite their vastness, an absence of economical methods for tapping into solar, wind-driven, or tidal reserves. Uranium suppliers hope that this will mean an increase in market share and an increase in volume over the long term. Uranium prices reached an all-time low in 2001, costing US$7/lb. This was followed by a period of gradual rise, followed by a bubble culminating in mid-2007, which caused the price to peak at around US$137/lb. This was the highest price (adjusted for inflation) in 25 years. The higher price during the bubble has spurred new prospecting and reopening of old mines. In 2012 Kazatomprom and Areva were the top two producing companies (with 15% of the production each), followed by Cameco (14%), ARMZ Uranium Holding (13%) and Rio Tinto (9%). Following the shutdown of many nuclear power plants after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, demand had fallen to about per year in 2015 with future forecasts uncertain. Because of the improvements in gas centrifuge technology in the 2000s, replacing former gaseous diffusion plants, cheaper separative work units have enabled the economic production of more enriched uranium from a given amount of natural uranium, by re-enriching tails ultimately leaving a depleted uranium tail of lower enrichment. This has somewhat lowered the demand for natural uranium. Market operations Unlike other metals such as copper or nickel, uranium is not traded on an organized commodity exchange such as the London Metal Exchange. Instead it is traded in most cases through contracts negotiated directly between a buyer and a seller. Recently, however, the New York Mercantile Exchange announced a 10-year agreement to provide for the trade of on and off exchange uranium futures contracts. The structure of uranium supply contracts varies widely. Pricing can be as simple as a single fixed price, or based on various reference prices with economic corrections built in. Contracts traditionally specify a base price, such as the uranium spot price, and rules for escalation. In base-escalated contracts, the buyer and seller agree on a base price that escalates over time on the basis of an agreed-upon formula, which may take economic indices, such as GDP or inflation factors, into consideration. A spot market contract usually consists of just one delivery and is typically priced at or near the published spot market price at the time of purchase. However 85% of all uranium has been sold under long-term, multi-year contracts with deliveries starting one to three years after the contract is made. Long-term contract terms range from two to 10 years, but typically run three to five years, with the first delivery occurring within 24 months of contract award. They may also include a clause that allows the buyer to vary the size of each delivery within prescribed limits. For example, delivery quantities may vary from the prescribed annual volume by plus or minus 15%. One of the peculiarities of the nuclear fuel cycle is the way in which utilities with nuclear power plants buy their fuel. Instead of buying fuel bundles from the fabricator, the usual approach is to purchase uranium in all of these intermediate forms. Typically, a fuel buyer from power utilities will contract separately with suppliers at each step of the process. Sometimes, the fuel buyer may purchase enriched uranium product, the end product of the first three stages, and contract separately for fabrication, the fourth step to eventually obtain the fuel in a form that can be loaded into the reactor. The utilities believe—rightly or wrongly—that these options offers them the best price and service. They will typically retain two or three suppliers for each stage of the fuel cycle, who compete for their business by tender. Sellers consist of suppliers in each of the four stages as well as brokers and traders. There are fewer than 100 companies that buy and sell uranium in the western world. In addition to being sold in different forms, uranium markets are differentiated by geography. The global trading of uranium has evolved into two distinct marketplaces shaped by historical and political forces. The first, the western world marketplace comprises the Americas, Western Europe and Australia. A separate marketplace comprises countries within the former Soviet Union, or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Eastern Europe and China. Most of the fuel requirements for nuclear power plants in the CIS are supplied from the CIS's own stockpiles. Often producers within the CIS also supply uranium and fuel products to the western world, increasing competition. Available supply thumb260pxThe Estimate of Available Uranium depends on what resources are included in the estimate. The squares represent relative sizes of different estimates, whereas the numbers at the lower edge show how long the given resource would last at present consumption. ██ Reserves in current mines ██ Known economic reserves ██ Conventional undiscovered resources ██ Total ore resources at 2004 prices ██ Unconventional resources (at least 4 billion tons, could last for millennia) As of 2015, total identified uranium resources were sufficient for more than a century of supply based on current requirements. In 1983, physicist Bernard Cohen proposed that the world supply of uranium is effectively inexhaustible, and could therefore be considered a form of renewable energy. He noted that fast breeder reactors, fueled by naturally- replenished uranium extracted from seawater, could supply energy at least as long as the sun's expected remaining lifespan of five billion years. These reactors would use uranium-238, which is more abundant than the uranium-235 required by conventional reactors.

Information  The player was introduced in 1987 to take over the spot previously filled by the LD-S1, Pioneer's most expensive LaserDisc player (however the later LD-S2 would be the S1's official replacement). The unit's internals were largely carryover parts from the S1, including advanced circuitry to reduce picture noise and the ability to down-convert digital soundtracks to analog for output to analog sound systems and television sets; like the S1, it lacked a dedicated output for digital sound, although one can be added. The CLD-1010 was also the first LaserDisc player capable of playing the then-new CD Video format of discs. Although its high price and the general worldwide disinterest in LaserDisc kept the player from becoming a major success, it is today often lauded by those who continue to enjoy the now defunct LD format. Its advanced noise-reduction circuitry helps provide a very appealing picture, while their very low pricing (usually around $50 USD) make them easily affordable. However, the age of the players means that they are often in need of service or repairs, something that has become difficult both because of the dearth of repair shops capable of working on them and because Pioneer has largely abandoned manufacturing replacement parts for them. Nonetheless, a fully reconditioned player can be had for around $200, a relative bargain considering the prices often commanded by other high quality units. The S1 was replaced by the LD-S2, one of the first pieces of equipment in the then-new \\"Elite\\" lineup.  Upgradeability  Despite its capabilities, the S1 lacks two features often demanded by LD enthusiasts: a dedicated output for digital audio and an AC-3 output capable of sending out the modulated AC-3/Dolby Digital audio found on most LD releases from the mid and late 1990s. Fortunately, both are fairly easy to add to the player and often technicians that are qualified to recondition the players are also capable of adding the outputs.  Subsequent models  Later models under the same line include the CLD 2070, 2090, 3090 & 3390\\\\. The video of the CLD 2090 was impressive, and rivals the Elite models which were released shortly in the early 90s. Pioneer started the Elite line to separate the mid range players from the higher end players. The CLD 2090 comes with S-video out and optical audio out. In comparison, the video quality even surpasses the late 90s model DVL 909 (LD and DVD player).  Red Laser Myth  The CLD-1010 was originally thought to carry a Red Laser, later contained in Muse players, but this has since been debunked by reading the service manual. This model contains a standard laser which was used in other Pioneer LD players throughout their production runs.

Occupying a half city block, the museum campus includes the main museum building, a log house, the MacDonell House (a Victorian mansion), a Shay Locomotive display, the Children's Discovery Center, genealogy and local history library, railroad archives, and the Children's Garden. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. According to recent reports of the American Alliance of Museums Accreditation Department, less than 800 museums, out of more than 11,000 in the United States, are accredited. Standards for accreditation apply across the board to both small and large institutions.  History  The Allen County Museum is operated by the Allen County Historical Society which was formed in 1908. Originally located in Lima's Memorial Hall, the Historical Society outgrew the available space by 1935, and began privately raising funds to build a museum. Spearheaded by Elizabeth M. MacDonell, and supported by the notable John Wesley Van Dyke, Chairman of the Atlantic Refining Company, the organization successfully raised the needed funds to build a separate facility. World War II interrupted construction plans, but by 1954 the cornerstone was laid—a stone from the original White House, Washington, D.C. Since that time, the Historical Society has amassed a large collection of items—both local and international. Archival and documentary railroad collections include builder's prints and diagrams from the Lima Locomotive Works, which was the third largest steam locomotive builder in the United States. Central to the production of the Lima Locomotive Works was the Shay engine, invented by Ephraim Shay.  Notable Exhibits = Sheriff Sarber/ John Dillinger Jail Cell  One of the museums most popular exhibits is a replica 1930's county jail cell; the exhibit portrays life-size wax figurines of infamous gangster and bank robber John Dillinger and local police Sheriff Jess Sarber. In May 1933, Dillinger had made parole after serving a nine and a half year prison sentence at the Indiana Reformatory and Indiana State Prison. A month after his parole, Dillinger began his bank robbing spree. After robbing banks in New Carlisle and Bluffton, Ohio, Dayton police captured Dillinger in August 1933 and delivered him to the Allen County Jail in Lima where he was held in connection to his crimes. Upon entrance into the jail, Dillinger was searched where investigators found prison escape plans. When asked about the papers, Dillinger refused to answer. The papers were a blueprint for the escape of eight prisoners, known as the First Dillinger Gang. The plans, already in the hands of the prisoners, proved successful and the convicts escaped their prison cells four days after Dillinger's capture. Three of Dillinger's men: Pete Piermont, Russell Clark, and Charles Mackley made their way to the Lima jail where they impersonated Indiana State police officers seeking to extradite Dillinger back to Indiana. When Sheriff Sarber asked for identification, Piermont shot and killed Sarber. The three then unlocked Dillinger's cell and escaped back to Indiana where they met up with the rest of the gang.\\"Famous Cases: John Dillinger\\". Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The death of Sheriff Sarber also led the FBI to name Dillinger Public Enemy #1.  Shay Locomotive  After the expansion of the museum from 2006 to 2009, the No. 10 Shay Locomotive Engine found its new home behind of the museum's iron clad window structure, making it the visual centerpiece of the museum. The Engine was manufactured by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1925 for the Lima Stone Company. The engine is a 3-foot gauge, two-truck geared locomotive and weighs approximately 24 ton. The stone company that used the locomotive operated a quarry near E. North Street in Lima from about 1914 to 1933. The locomotive was rescued in 1953 only hours before being cut up for scrap, and was restored at no cost by Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton for the Allen County Historical Society.H.L. Thomas, \\"Lima Reclaims Her Own,\\" Trains magazine, December 1954 The train was placed on a lot on Metcalf Street where a shelter was built around it until it was permanently relocated inside the museum. The locomotive is just one example of the numerous engines to come out of the city of Lima. During its height, Lima Locomotive Works was the third largest producer of steam locomotive engines.https://www.american-rails.com/lima-locomotive- works.html  Native American Artifacts  The museum has a significant collection of Native American artifacts including art, pottery, clothing, arrowheads, and other remnants of the original inhabitants. Collections are categorized by the period in which the artifacts belong, going as far back as during the time of the Ice Age nearly 10,000 years ago. The largest collection of artifacts are from early and late modern history and show objects that were used in everyday life by the Native Americans. One particular sign shows the original boundaries of the Shawnee Reservation that was allocated to the tribes to live on. Later treaties would force the natives West from this land. Another exhibit shows a recreation of the remains of a prehistoric Glacial Kame burial. The Kame people were a group of Native Americans who lived in the area about 4,000 years ago. The mock skeleton shows the ritual process of burying the individual in a flexed position with their legs drawn up against the upper torso. The original skeleton was discovered in 1960 along with others in a mass burial just outside the city; the site is one of three burial sites located within Allen County.  George Washington's Mount Vernon  On the upper level, the museum has an encased model of life at President Washington's Mount Vernon. The model shows the daily life of workers and family on the plantation and displays the floor plan and rooms of the mansion. George S. Pond and his son Stanton began the project in 1935 and took almost two and half years to complete. The model is and intricate work of art with thousands of pieces distinctly designed for the mansion. An example of complexity and dedication is the house's roofing shingles; more than 8,000 pieces were individually stained, polished, and placed on the model. The model also comes with doors with actual working hinges and can open and close with personally designed keys and locks. The room in which the exhibit is displayed houses a variety of priceless artifacts including French Canton glassware used by Washington and his staff, busts of famous Americans, original pages from the ledger of King George III with the King's actual signatures affixed on the top, and an original 1795 American flag.  Vehicles & Carriages  The museum houses and impressive collection of motorized and non-motorized vehicles. The collection includes Milburn Light Electric Car made by the Milburn Wagon Company in 1923, a 1909 gasoline powered Locomobile Sports Roadster, a J.K. Fetter & Son Studebaker wagon, William Cron & Sons single horse buggy, a restored 1920's Meadow Gold Milk Wagon, a 1925 Ford Model T Roadster, and a 1908 Thor Single Engine Motorcycle. The museum also displays a fully restored Gramm-Bernstein \\"Liberty Truck.\\" From 1917 to 1919, over 5,000 of the U.S. Army Liberty Trucks were built in Lima by the Gramm-Bernstein and Garford companies. A strict standardization code was placed on the vehicles thus allowing the parts to be interchangeable if need be. These vehicles saw significant use in Europe and the United States during World War I.  Unique  The museum is also known for its vast collection of unique artifacts such as housing the world's largest collection of albino animals, replica room of Noah's Ark, two horse-drawn hearses (one with a display coffin still inside), and an interactive Native American Wigwam. Perhaps the most unusual exhibit is its collection of over one hundred objects removed from the mouth, throat, or esophagus by doctors Walter and Estey Yingling. The objects vary from coins, bones, teeth, buttons to larger pieces such as jewelry, bobby pins, a screw, keys, and a rubber hose.http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Allen_County_Museum MacDonell House The MacDonnell House, also known as Banta-Van Dyke House, is a Shingle style house that was built in 1893. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The listing included two contributing buildings. Outreach The Museum offers monthly lectures and programs, Traveling Trunks, demonstrations, and special events, including the annual Christmas Tree Festival.

TP&W; has trackage rights between Galesburg, Illinois, and Peoria, between Logansport and Kokomo, Indiana, and between Reynolds, Indiana, and Lafayette, Indiana. TPW has connections with UP, BNSF, NS, CSXT, CN, CP, CERA, CIM, KBSR and T&P.; The railroad is now owned by Genesee & Wyoming Inc. The railroad's traffic comes largely from agricultural products, including both raw and processed grain products, as well as chemicals and completed tractors. The TPW hauled around 26,000 carloads in 2008. Early history Toledo, Peoria & Western's earliest ancestor was the Peoria and Oquawka. The eastern extension began construction, three years after its charter, in 1855. The Toledo, Peoria & Warsaw Railway was chartered in 1863, and opened in 1868 from the state line at Indiana across Illinois to the Mississippi River at Warsaw. This line was reorganized as the Toledo, Peoria & Western Railroad in 1880 and leased to the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railroad. The lease lasted four years and the Toledo, Peoria & Western Railway took over in 1887.Drury, George H., The Train Watcher's Guide to North American Railroads, Kalmbach, 1990, p.190 The Toledo, Peoria & Western Railway was incorporated in Illinois on March 28, 1887, and consolidated the operation of the Toledo, Peoria & Warsaw Railway and the Logansport, Peoria & Burlington Railroad. The LP&B; built from Galesburg to East Burlington, Illinois in 1855, and reached Gilman, Illinois in 1857 and Effner in 1859. A TP&W; passenger train was involved in the Great Chatsworth Train Wreck in Chatsworth, Illinois in 1887. Courting the Pennsy and the Santa Fe The Toledo, Peoria & Western Railroad was affiliated with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1918. This meant that the western terminus for the PRR was in Keokuk, Iowa and the Santa Fe interchange at Lomax, Illinois. In 1937, the TP&W; purchased six Class H-10 Northerns from the American Locomotive Company. These locomotives were given road numbers 80 through 85 and were the lightest 4-8-4 ever built for a North American railroad, weighing only 361,000 pounds. They had 69-inch drivers, 23.5 x 30 cylinders, a boiler pressure and a tractive effort of 51,000 pounds. Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad number 400, an ALCO RS-11, on display at the Illinois Railway Museum, in Union, Illinois. In January 1960 the ATSF and PRR gained joint control (half interests) of TP&W.; When Conrail was created in 1976 the TP&W; acquired the former Pennsylvania Railroad trackage from Effner into Logansport, the Effner Branch, which otherwise would have been abandoned. The value of this trackage diminished in 1981 when Conrail closed the Logansport interchange. At the end of 1970 TP&W; operated 239 miles of road on 323 miles of track; in 1970 it reported 520 million ton-miles of revenue freight. On June 21, 1970, the TP&W;'s eastbound freight train No. 20 derailed mid-train in Crescent City, Illinois. One of the tank cars punctured, with the released propane igniting and engulfing the other tank cars, destroying most of the business district and several homes and injuring 64. In 1979 the Santa Fe reached agreement to acquire the former Pennsylvania Railroad's interest in TP&W.; TP&W; was merged into ATSF on December 31, 1983. From Santa Fe to Susquehanna The ATSF sold the Lomax-Peoria-Logansport main line on February 3, 1989 to new investors, who revived the TP&W; name and making it an independent railroad again. When the parent companies of ATSF and Burlington Northern merged in 1995 TP&W; was granted operating rights over BN's line between Peoria and Galesburg, Illinois. In 1995, the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad acquired a 40% interest in the TP&W;, with full control going to Delaware Otsego Corporation in 1996. During this time, this regional railroad that operates in Illinois and Indiana was dispatched from the DO offices in Cooperstown, New York. Some TP&W; locomotives were painted in the NYSW's distinctive yellow-and-black paint scheme during this time. In 1998, TP&W; had revenues of approximately $13.4 million and moved over 59,000 freight carloads and intermodal units. It was acquired by RailAmerica in 1999, and it is still operated as TP&W.; The Genesee & Wyoming acquired RailAmerica in late 2012, gaining ownership of the TP&W.; Keokuk Junction Railway purchases The Keokuk Junction Railway now owns parts of the old TP&W; line, including the Western Illinois & Keokuk section of TP&W; (Fulton, McDonough and Hancock counties in Illinois). In December 1986, KJRY purchased 33.5 miles of former TP&W; trackage (then owned by the Santa Fe Railroad) from Keokuk, Iowa, and Warsaw, Illinois, to La Harpe, Illinois. KJRY's feeder line application with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to acquire the assets of the west end of the new TP&W; was granted on 2004-10-28. KJRY completed the acquisition on 2005-02-11, adding 76 miles from LaHarpe to Peoria, the old TP&W; main line west of Peoria.

It was later shown that the homotopy group \\\\pi_3(S^2) is the infinite cyclic group generated by \\\\eta. In 1951, Jean-Pierre Serre proved that the rational homotopy groups :\\\\pi_i(S^n) \\\\otimes \\\\mathbb{Q} for an odd- dimensional sphere (n odd) are zero unless i is equal to 0 or n. However, for an even-dimensional sphere (n even), there is one more bit of infinite cyclic homotopy in degree 2n-1.  Definition  Let \\\\phi \\\\colon S^{2n-1} \\\\to S^n be a continuous map (assume n>1). Then we can form the cell complex : C_\\\\phi = S^n \\\\cup_\\\\phi D^{2n}, where D^{2n} is a 2n-dimensional disc attached to S^n via \\\\phi. The cellular chain groups C^*_\\\\mathrm{cell}(C_\\\\phi) are just freely generated on the i-cells in degree i, so they are \\\\mathbb{Z} in degree 0, n and 2n and zero everywhere else. Cellular (co-)homology is the (co-)homology of this chain complex, and since all boundary homomorphisms must be zero (recall that n>1), the cohomology is : H^i_\\\\mathrm{cell}(C_\\\\phi) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathbb{Z} & i=0,n,2n, \\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox{otherwise}. \\\\end{cases} Denote the generators of the cohomology groups by : H^n(C_\\\\phi) = \\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\rangle and H^{2n}(C_\\\\phi) = \\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\rangle. For dimensional reasons, all cup-products between those classes must be trivial apart from \\\\alpha \\\\smile \\\\alpha. Thus, as a ring, the cohomology is : H^*(C_\\\\phi) = \\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\alpha,\\\\beta]/\\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\smile\\\\beta = \\\\alpha\\\\smile\\\\beta = 0, \\\\alpha\\\\smile\\\\alpha=h(\\\\phi)\\\\beta\\\\rangle. The integer h(\\\\phi) is the Hopf invariant of the map \\\\phi.  Properties  Theorem: The map h\\\\colon\\\\pi_{2n-1}(S^n)\\\\to\\\\mathbb{Z} is a homomorphism. Moreover, if n is even, h maps onto 2\\\\mathbb{Z}. The Hopf invariant is 1 for the Hopf maps, where n=1,2,4,8, corresponding to the real division algebras \\\\mathbb{A}=\\\\mathbb{R},\\\\mathbb{C},\\\\mathbb{H},\\\\mathbb{O}, respectively, and to the fibration S(\\\\mathbb{A}^2)\\\\to\\\\mathbb{PA}^1 sending a direction on the sphere to the subspace it spans. It is a theorem, proved first by Frank Adams, and subsequently by Adams and Michael Atiyah with methods of topological K-theory, that these are the only maps with Hopf invariant 1.  Generalisations for stable maps  A very general notion of the Hopf invariant can be defined, but it requires a certain amount of homotopy theoretic groundwork: Let V denote a vector space and V^\\\\infty its one-point compactification, i.e. V \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{R}^k and :V^\\\\infty \\\\cong S^k for some k. If (X,x_0) is any pointed space (as it is implicitly in the previous section), and if we take the point at infinity to be the basepoint of V^\\\\infty, then we can form the wedge products :V^\\\\infty \\\\wedge X. Now let :F \\\\colon V^\\\\infty \\\\wedge X \\\\to V^\\\\infty \\\\wedge Y be a stable map, i.e. stable under the reduced suspension functor. The (stable) geometric Hopf invariant of F is :h(F) \\\\in {X, Y \\\\wedge Y}_{\\\\mathbb{Z}_2}, an element of the stable \\\\mathbb{Z}_2-equivariant homotopy group of maps from X to Y \\\\wedge Y. Here \\"stable\\" means \\"stable under suspension\\", i.e. the direct limit over V (or k, if you will) of the ordinary, equivariant homotopy groups; and the \\\\mathbb{Z}_2-action is the trivial action on X and the flipping of the two factors on Y \\\\wedge Y. If we let :\\\\Delta_X \\\\colon X \\\\to X \\\\wedge X denote the canonical diagonal map and I the identity, then the Hopf invariant is defined by the following: :h(F) := (F \\\\wedge F) (I \\\\wedge \\\\Delta_X) - (I \\\\wedge \\\\Delta_Y) (I \\\\wedge F). This map is initially a map from :V^\\\\infty \\\\wedge V^\\\\infty \\\\wedge X to V^\\\\infty \\\\wedge V^\\\\infty \\\\wedge Y \\\\wedge Y, but under the direct limit it becomes the advertised element of the stable homotopy \\\\mathbb{Z}_2-equivariant group of maps. There exists also an unstable version of the Hopf invariant h_V(F), for which one must keep track of the vector space V.

The group used the language and rhetoric of conservative moralists for the ostensible aim of clothing \\"indecent\\" naked animals, including domestic pets, barnyard animals, and large wildlife. The society and its aims were then largely presented in the public arena on news and talk shows by comedian/improviser Buck Henry (in the guise of SINA president \\"G. Clifford Prout\\") from 1959 through 1963. History In 1959, Alan Abel wrote a satirical story about an imaginary organization for The Saturday Evening Post but the editors rejected it. Abel then transformed his story into a series of press releases from the organization that garnered media attention. Looking to expand the range and impact of the hoax, Abel persuaded the actor Buck Henry to assume the role of the group president, G. Clifford Prout, Jr., in U.S. television news and talk show appearances. Henry, who had improv training, was able to play Prout with an intense deadpan sincerity, as well as to stay in character though unscripted interviews. During the interviews, Prout was often presented as an amusing eccentric, but was otherwise taken seriously by the broadcasters who interviewed him. Abel (seen far less frequently) played the group's executive vice-president Bruce Spencer. Over time, the history of SINA and some of its specific aims were codified into a coherent (if unlikely) backstory. The group had been founded some years before by G. Clifford Prout, Sr., and was being carried on by his son. An alleged debate within SINA was how large an animal had to be to require clothing; the official position quoted by Prout was \\"any dog, cat, horse or cow that stands higher than 4 inches or longer than 6 inches.\\" Slogans such as \\"Decency today means morality tomorrow\\" and \\"A nude horse is a rude horse\\" were offered. The group received widespread American media coverage, beginning with an appearance by G. Clifford Prout on NBC's Today Show on May 27, 1959. Press releases and media appearances continued for the next few years, until the hoax was finally revealed in late 1962.  Support and anthems  There was no membership fee to join SINA, as the official society policy for membership stated that \\"you must only demonstrate a desire to be decent by clothing your animals, and in some instances those of your neighbors.\\" Headquarters were at 507 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, a real address which Abel used to receive SINA mail. Some letters were from people looking to subscribe to SINA's occasional newsletter; others were from potential newsletter contributors, as the organization also sponsored mail-in essay-writing contests such as \\"Why I Choose To Be A Decent Person.\\" SINA also (falsely) claimed to have branch offices in London, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco. SINA actually acquired ardent supporters, some of whom attempted to contribute a great deal of money to the organization. The money was invariably returned, as neither Abel nor Henry wished to be charged with mail fraud by accepting donations for a bogus charity. In public appearances (and in letters accompanying returned money or checks), \\"Prout\\" was careful to note that the by-laws of SINA prevented him from accepting donations, as he was independently wealthy and financed the operation through his own private means. He therefore did not require financial assistance. Nevertheless, the letters of support and offers of money aided SINA's (false) claims of gaining momentum; at one time they claimed tens of thousands of members. They published a newsletter, in an issue of which is this anthem: : High on the wings of SINA / we fight for the future now; : Let's clothe every pet and animal / whether dog, cat, horse or cow! : G. Clifford Prout, our President / he works for you and me, : So clothe all your pets and join the march / for worldwide Decency! : S.I.N.A., that's our call / all for one and one for all. : Hoist our flag for all to see / waving for Morality. : Onward we strive together / stronger in every way, : All mankind and his animal friends / for SINA, S-I-N-A! At least one LP record, Inside SINA, was released, containing interview material with G. Clifford Prout and Bruce Spencer. The album contains several SINA-related anthems and songs, and a Q&A; feature detailing SINA and its aims.  Exposure  The hoax was exposed when staff on Walter Cronkite's CBS television news show recognized Buck Henry while broadcasting an interview of \\"G. Clifford Prout\\" by Cronkite. (Henry was known to some of the crew, as he was working for CBS at the time, albeit in another department.) The interview was broadcast on August 21, 1962, and Abel noted: “When Cronkite eventually found out that he’d been conned, and I was the guy behind it, he called me up. I’d never heard him that angry on TV — not about Hitler, Saddam Hussein, or Fidel Castro. He was furious with me.” A 1963 Time article formally exposed the hoax. Abel managed to keep the newsletter going for several more years, hoaxing members who had not seen or heard of that Cronkite episode or read the Time article — or who simply enjoyed the humor of the hoax. The Society for Indecency to Naked Animals hoax was chronicled in Abel's book, The Great American Hoax, published in 1966.

It happened when the waters of Lake Maumee, possibly in response to an advance of the ice front at the eastern end of the lake, overtopped a \\"sag\\" or low spot in the Fort Wayne Moraine, which was a deposit of glacial debris that acted as a natural dam at the site of present- day Fort Wayne, Indiana. This unleashed a massive flow of water that scoured a one- to two-mile-wide outlet running southwest to the Wabash River known as the \\"Wabash-Erie Channel\\", which probably followed the course of earlier, less massive drainage. The channel, now a small stream called the Little River, is the largest topographical feature in Allen County, Indiana. As much as 30 feet of fine sand, silt and organic sediments were deposited in the channel before drainage reversed and was captured by the present-day Maumee River. U.S. Route 24 between Fort Wayne and Huntington follows the channel.Water Resource Availability in the Maumee River Basin, Indiana, pages 37 & 48 Water Resource Assessment 96-5, Indianapolis: Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water (1996) Approximately 14,000 years before present, Lake Maumee overtopped the Fort Wayne Moraine. The flood removed all earlier sediment and deepened the valley bottom by . Lake Maumee had reached above sea level when the lake poured through a sag in the Fort Wayne Moraine into the ancestral Little River and then the Wabash River. There is some evidence that the final rise in lake level that caused it to overtop the moraine was caused by a minor re-advance of the glacier further east in the basin. The soft till of the moraine was quickly eroded by the volume of water in the lake, releasing a massive volume of water. A second outlet opened at Six-Mile Creek into the St. Marys River and into the Little River Valley. The earlier sediments were removed in bulk, leaving only the Sand Point and a few gravel terraces on the valley walls. The flood scoured the length of the Wabash River. The limestone bedrock under the Little River Valley near Huntington created a sill, limiting the depth to which the Torrent and the future river could erode. The well-developed beach ridges in Ohio and eastern Allen County show a series of lower lake levels.

They were the third Commonwealth Youth Games, which are held every four years; they were the first Commonwealth Youth Games to be held in Asia. The III Commonwealth Youth Games were conducted from 12 to 18 October 2008. Over 1,300 athletes and 350 officials from 71 countries participated in these games. The III Commonwealth Youth Games is unique for its green theme, which permeates all aspects of the Games. A special drive is being conducted by the game organisers to create a \\"save the tigers\\" campaign to promote awareness of the critical state of the Indian tiger. Sports boxing  There were nine sports on the programme for the 2008 Games. Each sport has a unique pictogram to represent it. The pictograms are designed to be, like the 2008 CYG logo, a balance between the cultural heritage of India and the modern India. The pictograms have been derived from the tribal art form of Warli. * 20px Athletics * 20px Badminton * 20px Boxing * 20px Shooting * 20px Swimming * 20px Table Tennis * 20px Tennis * 20px Weightlifting * 20px Wrestling  Opening Ceremony  The spectacular Opening Ceremony included several performances showcasing Indian culture and tradition. There was also a unique show set up by the Indian Air Force. Abhinav Bindra, India's gold medal winner at the Beijing Olympics, was the final Youth Baton Runner, who poured the water collected from different countries into a kalash. The \\"Fountain of Youth\\" was later formed from this water. Veteran actress Hema Malini performed a beautiful prayer dance. Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan also performed during the event. Singers Sunidhi Chauhan and Shankar Mahadevan sang the theme song. There was also a performance by the Indian actress Urmila Matondkar. The President of India, Pratibha Patil, declared the Games open. The entire event was choreographed by Shiamak Davar. Various schools from Pune participated in the event.  Closing Ceremony  The Closing Ceremony of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games included the presence of several dignitaries and Bollywood stars. The ceremonies began with a special dog show organised by the military of India. This was followed by the official ceremony, when the Secretary of the Commonwealth Games Federation declared the Games closed. The cultural part included musical performances by some of the finest singers from India, such as Shaan, Kunal Ganjawala, and Shiamak Davar, the choreographer of the event. A few select schools were selected to perform in the closing ceremony, like Kamalnayan Bajaj and St. Ursula's. These dances were also choreographed by Shiamak Davar's group. Various indigenous cultures from Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western India were shown by Diya Mirza, Neha Dhupia, and Malaika Arora. Bollywood actor Ritesh Deshmukh also performed with them during the event. Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty also performed during the event. The \\"Fountain of Youth\\" which was created during the Opening Ceremony was slowly lowered and a \\"Garden of Youth\\" was formed. The \\"Garden of Youth\\" will remain outside the stadium as a part of the legacy. The hand over ceremony included a seven-minute show from the Isle of Man, who will host the games in 2011. The official mascot of the 2008 Games, Jiggr said good bye to the competitors of the youth Games, after which the mascot for the Delhi 2010 Games, Sheru, welcomed all to Delhi. The closing ceremonies were ended with fireworks. Marketing Jigrr, Official mascot of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games Logo The logo of the Games reflect the heritage of Pune and Maharashtra. The seal features the city's name 'Pune' in both English script and Devanagari/Sanskrit script. The seal itself is derived from the Maratha seal of the Maratha king, Shivaji. It is a fusion of the traditional Pune culture and modernity. Mascot The name of the official mascot of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games is \\"Jigrr\\". The mascot is a tiger, the national animal of India. Jigrr is the younger brother of 'Shera', the mascot of 2010 Commonwealth Games. Jigrr the name, is an amalgam of the word 'Jigar', which implies courage in Hindi language and also the sound of tiger roar 'grrr...' Youth Baton Relay For the Youth Games 2008, a new concept called the \\"Youth Baton Relay\\" (based on the Queen's Baton Relay) has been created by the organizers. For the event, a baton will be carried through nine Indian states, carrying water from around the country. The Youth Baton Relay will begin at New Delhi University North Campus and proceed to India Gate on 1 August 2008, at a large cultural festival. The Baton will then travel through nine states, and cover over 8000 km. Six thousand athletes have been selected to carry the Baton; an additional 7500 volunteers will help the Baton through 199 cities, towns and villages. Additionally, approximately 80 crew, 25 vehicles and guests, media and VIP's will escort the baton on its trip. In keeping with the \\"green games\\" theme for both the 2008 Youth Games and the 2010 Commonwealth Games, the relay will be in support of the 'save the tiger' campaign. The collected water is to symbolise the conservation of natural resources, and will be used at the opening ceremony to create a \\"fountain of Youth\\". A \\"garden of youth\\" will also be created by the 71 participating nations at Balewadi Stadium.

The corvette was attacked and sunk off Betano Bay (), on the south coast of Portuguese Timor, (now East Timor) by 13 Japanese aircraft on 1 December 1942, while attempting to evacuate Australian and Dutch soldiers and deliver a relief contingent. She was the only Bathurst-class corvette to be lost to enemy action.David Stevens et al., 2001, The Royal Australian Navy, opposite p. 112 Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to be fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Armidale) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Armidale was laid down by Morts Dock & Engineering Co in Sydney on 1 September 1941. As the ship was built in a dock, she was floated on 24 January 1942, with the ceremony officiated by Reverend A. G. Rix. Armidale was commissioned on 11 June 1942. Operational history Following commissioning, Armidales primary role was the escort of convoys along the Australian coast and from Australia to New Guinea. In October 1942, Armidale was reassigned to the 24th Minesweeping Flotilla, operating out of Darwin. Betano Bay In late November 1942, the RAN was called on to evacuate the commandos of the 2/2nd Independent Company (an evacuation attempt in September failed when the destroyer grounded, then was destroyed by Japanese aircraft), a contingent of Dutch troops, and over 100 Portuguese civilians, while delivering a relief contingent of Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and Australian soldiers.Feuer, Heroic stand of HMAS Armidale, p.50 Armidale, sister ship , and the auxiliary patrol boat were assigned to the operation by Commodore Cuthbert Pope, Naval Officer in Charge Darwin, with Castlemaine the commanding ship. The plan was for Kuru to reach Betano Bay early on the night of 30 November, offload supplies, and take on the civilians. The two corvettes were to arrive two hours later; Kuru would deliver her passengers to Castlemaine, which was to head for Darwin at first opportunity, then shuttle relief troops aboard Armidale to shore while evacuating the soldiers. The corvettes sailed from Darwin at midday on 29 November, leaving just as Japanese aircraft flew over the harbour. At 09:00 on 30 November, the two ships were located by a Japanese reconnaissance plane, but were unable to shoot it down. Because of the likelihood of attack during the day and the distance from the destination, the ships radioed Darwin and suggested that the mission be aborted, but Pope instructed they were to continue after steering away from their intended destination for an hour, and promised fighter support. Armidale and Castlemaine were attacked at midday by 14 Japanese bombers, but these were driven off by a force of Bristol Beaufighters, which then returned to Australia. Another attack came at 14:00, but neither side was able to do damage. Delays from the evasive course and two air attacks meant the corvettes reached Betano Bay after 02:30 on 1 December, with no sign of Kuru, and retreated to sea. Kuru was sighted at daybreak – assuming the corvettes were not coming, her commander chose to sail for Darwin with the civilians – and the civilians were transferred to Castlemaine. Although as senior ship, Castlemaines commanding officer felt he should return to Betano Bay with the soldiers, the troops were aboard the other corvette, and at 11:00 he ordered (with Commodore Pope's approval) Armidale and Kuru to return by separate routes and attempt the operation again that night. Loss At 13:00, five approaching Japanese dive-bombers were sighted by Armidale. Two aircraft were damaged by the corvette's guns, while the other three missed while attempting to evade fire. A second air attack occurred at 14:00; five Zero fighters distracted the corvette's weapons while nine torpedo bombers made attack runs. At one point, a late-released torpedo passed over the bridge before hitting the water. At 15:10, the ship was hit in the port side by two torpedoes in quick succession: the first into the mess deck, killing many of the soldiers there, the second into the engine room. As the soldiers and sailors began to evacuate into the water, the Zeroes stopped attacking the sinking corvette and began strafing runs on those in the water. Ordinary Seaman Edward \\"Teddy\\" Sheean, who had been wounded in the initial attack, strapped himself into one of Armidales 20 mm Oerlikons and opened fire on the aircraft.Straczek, Ordinary Seaman Edward Sheean Teddy forced one Zero to crash into the sea and damaged at least two others; continuing to fire until he went down with Armidale. In 2020, Sheean was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions. Low on fuel, the Japanese aircraft headed for home. The survivors found that the two ship's boats survived the sinking, and were able to fashion a raft from debris. This raft of Armidale survivors were not seen again after this photo was taken on 8 December 1942 The survivors remained together until midday on 2 December, when one of the boats, with the commanding officer aboard, set out for Darwin in an effort to find rescuers. At 10:15 on 5 December, they were spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft, and the 22 aboard were rescued by . On learning that more men were still at sea, an air search was organised, and the auxiliary patrol boat was to stand by off Melville Island. That same day, the other boat, with 29 aboard, headed for Darwin, leaving the raft, with 49 aboard, behind. At 16:00 on 8 December, a PBY Catalina flying boat sighted the raft, now with about 20 aboard, and the second boat. The aircraft was unable to land to assist either group of survivors because of rough seas, but directed Kalgoorlie to the boat. However, the raft could not be located again, and the search effort was called off on 13 December. 40 personnel from Armidale and 60 embarked men of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army were killed. Aftermath Following this attack, the Royal Australian Navy changed policy to prevent minimally armed vessels like the Bathurst-class corvettes travelling into areas of heavy enemy presence while attempting to perform tasks similar to Armidale.Walker, HMAS Armidale, p.

Her areas of scholarly expertise include the thought of Abraham Isaac Kook, the modern Musar movement and the ideology of Mitnaggedism, and Judaism and gender. She is the author of books and articles on Jewish ethics and theology, contemporary issues in traditional Jewish thought, philosophy of halakha, and Orthodox Jewish feminism. Ross makes a vital contribution to philosophical questions around gender in Judaism by arguing that feminism is not external to Torah but rather integral to it. She argues for the concept of evolving revelation, that is, that people learn more as history evolves and societies develop and mature, and argues against the concept of Yeridat ha-dorot, the idea that knowledge of Torah diminishes with time. She also argues against approaches of more liberal movements which address perceived flaws by challenging the divinity and religious validity of sacred texts and traditions, arguing that such an approach only undermined the foundations faith. She develops the metaphor of \\"Expanding the Palace of Torah\\", originally an idea of Abraham Isaac Kook, for an approach seeking to address contemporary concerns by expanding rather than undermining religious tradition. Ross is on the Advisory Council of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA). Ross has published widely on many topics relating to Jewish thought and the philosophy of halakha and was selected by the Israeli government as torchbearer in the Independence Day ceremony of 2013 for her contribution to women's learning.

He was a pupil at Whitgift School and studied at Imperial College (BSc(Eng) 1943) and University College London (PhD 1949; Fellow 1988). His scientific career started at the Admiralty Mining Establishment in 1943 where he worked with some notable scientists, including Harrie Massey who would later encourage Boyd to engage in atmospheric physics research at UCL. His thesis was on New Techniques for the Study of Ionised Gases. In addition to helping create the MSSL, Boyd played an instrumental role in the founding of the European Space Research Organization and its subsequent incarnation the European Space Agency (1974/75). Boyd succeeded Harrie Massey as the chair of the British National Committee for Space Research in 1976. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1969 and was knighted in 1983 in recognition of his services to space science. Boyd was a committed Christian and he saw no conflict but subtle complementarity between science and religion. His 1950s and 1960s writings and lectures on this relationship helped Christians to be more influential in science, through the Research Scientists' Christian Fellowship.

The school includes pre-elementary, elementary school, middle, and high schools to prepare students for secondary and tertiary education. History Founded as Hale High School by the Vestry of St. Timothy's Episcopal Church and Board of Trustees of St. Timothy's School of Raleigh (founded 1958), the school graduated its first class in 1973. In the fall of 1990, the Middle School of St. Timothy's, grades 6th through 8th, was moved from its Six Forks Road campus to Hale's White Oak Road campus. By the end of the school year, the Board of Trustees voted to combine Hale High School and St. Timothy's Middle School, resulting in the emergence of St. Timothy's-Hale School. The Board of St. Timothy's-Hale School later voted to sever from St. Timothy's School of Raleigh and the institutions became separate and independent of one another. The Board of St. Timothy's School of Raleigh also reestablished a Middle School on the original Six Forks Road campus to rejoin its Lower School, grades Pre-K through 5. In November 2002, the Board of the newly independent St. Timothy's-Hale School voted to add grades K–4 for the fall of 2003. In the spring of 2003, the school was renamed St. David's School and was expanded to include all grades, K–12, on the same campus. By the 2007-2008 school year, enrollment at St. David's stood at about 540 students. The 2008–2013 school years brought additional sections in lower school, which brought the student body to today's enrollment of more than 620. In 2012, an expansion project was completed, including a new gym with a weight room and locker rooms, a student commons area, additional offices and classrooms, a theater, fine art facilities, and a modern dining hall. In 2013, a 32-acre satellite field complex was added for athletics. The Dining Hall was renovated in 2015. A major expansion to the lower school was then finished just before the start of the 2016-2017 school year. Also before the 2016-2017 school year, the former Middle School 7-8 grade building, St. Albans, was torn down to make way for the construction of a new academic building that opened in August 2018.

Extra-curricular activities include two drama productions each year—a fall play and winter musical—and a show choir. St. David's band and choral students travel annually to competitions. Graduating students from St. David's have gone on to study at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, The Savannah College of Art and Design, The Rhode Island School of Design, Berkelee School of Music, Belmont University, and Vanderbilt University. Students have won statewide art competitions, and the Fine Arts department has received state recognition for excellence. Athletics St. David's, a member of the North Carolina Independent School Athletic Association (NCISAA), offers 42 boys' and girls' middle school, junior varsity, and varsity interscholastic athletic teams. St. David's is also a member the Eastern Plains Independent Conference (EPIC), which includes: Cary Christian School, Grace Christian School (Cary, NC), St. David's School, and the Arendell Parrott Academy (Kinston, NC).

Nahuelito is a lake monster reported to live in Nahuel Huapi Lake, Patagonia, Argentina. Like Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster, the Argentine creature is named after the lake it resides in and has been described as a giant serpent or a huge hump, as well as a plesiosaur. Nahuelito has been allegedly shown through photos showing a hump, or a serpentine body. History Its name means yaguarete, a large felid species from the Americas. The origin of the current legend is believed to go back to indigenous stories prior to the period of the conquest of America. The first explorers obtained from the natives of the place legends about the occasional encounters with aquatic monsters. In 1897, Dr. Clemente Onelli, director of the Buenos Aires Zoo, begins to receive sporadic reports about a possible strange creature inhabiting the Patagonian lakes. In 1910, George Garret worked at a company located near the Nahuel Huapi. After navigating the lake and about to disembark, he could see a creature about 400 meters away, the visible part of which was between 5 and 7 meters long and protruded about 2 meters above the water. Commenting on his experience with local people, Garret learns similar stories told by the indigenous people. But Garret's sighting in 1910 was only made public in 1922, when he recounted it to the Toronto Globe newspaper and echoed in the international press, thus motivating himself to organize the first expedition to search for Nahuelito. The Buenos Aires Zoo has been attempting to collect evidence of a plesiosaur in Argentina's Patagonian lakes since 1922, under the patronage of Clemente Onelli, but no consequential evidence was found. The small lake where the presence of the creature was claimed is known today as Laguna del Plesiosaurio (Plesiosaur's lagoon). More recently, in 1960, the Argentine Navy was said to have chased an unidentified underwater object in the lake for 18 days, without being able to identify it, which some people related to this alleged creature. In 1988, photos of the Nahuelito were published in a magazine of the Río Negro newspaper. These were taken at a short distance with an analog camera, in which the object was near the coast of Bariloche. \\"It is not a log of whimsical shapes. It is not a wave. El Nahuelito showed his face.\\" said a man, who did not reveal his name, in a letter he left with the photos.

Gameplay Smush was hosted by Ken Ober and co-hosted by Lisa Dergan.\\"Smush\\" (2001) The show, set in a basement party atmosphere, featured four contestants trying to \\"smush\\" the answers to clues together to create a new phrase. For example, the clue \\"A New England state + 'Flying Circus' man\\" would result in an answer of \\"Vermonty Python,\\" formed by combining \\"Vermont\\" and \\"Monty Python\\". Smushes did not have to use the exact spelling of both words. For example, \\"Belly Lafghanistan\\" could be a combination of \\"belly laugh\\" and \\"Afghanistan.\\" Rounds 1 and 2 Rapid- fire clues are presented in which the answers smush together. The first contestant to buzz in with the correct answer scored points, but an incorrect answer gave the opposing contestants a chance to take a guess. Round one featured two-part clues which created two answers to be smushed together. Each correct answer was worth one point. Later in that round, the remaining clues were visual clues. Round two had three-part clues with three answers smushed together, called \\"Smush Tris\\", with each correct answer worth two points. The final smush in the second round was called the \\"Smush Quad\\", a four-part clue worth three points. The contestant with the lowest score at the end of each of the first two rounds was eliminated from the game. Round 3 (Smush Chain) Round three was called the \\"Smush Chain.\\" Clues were given one at a time to a smush that would grow progressively longer. To score, the contestant must buzz in and recite the entire chain, starting at the first clue. A total of seven clues were asked, the first of which served as the base of the smush, and was not a smush in itself. For example, the chain might become \\"Leap Yeardrum Major Tommy Thompson Twin Cities,\\" by combining \\"Leap Year,\\" \\"Ear Drum,\\" \\"Drum Major,\\" \\"Major Tom,\\" \\"Tommy Thompson,\\" \\"Thompson Twins,\\" and \\"twin cities.\\" The first clue was worth one point, the second clue was worth two points, and so on, up to seven points. The contestant with the higher score went on to the bonus round. Money Round In the bonus round, hostess Lisa wrote a word or phrase on a mirror in lipstick which served as the root word for the next five smushes. Five clues were read one at a time, the answers to which smush to either the left or right side of the root word. The winning contestant had 45 seconds to answer those clues. For each correct smush given, the winning contestant was awarded $1,000. If the contestant made a mistake the clue and smush was thrown out. The winning contestant could pass on a clue and return to it if time remained. If the contestant answered all five clues correctly in 45 seconds or less, the contestant won a total of $8,000.

The park's amenities are designed primarily for hikers, backpackers, and horseback riders and consequently use remains light compared to other state parks around the metro area. It preserves a remnant of Big Woods atop a hilly, glacially-formed landscape dotted with lakes and wetlands. The park was established in 1963 west of the city of Monticello. Natural history The St. Croix Moraine runs through the park. This rolling and uneven landform is a result of the Wisconsin glaciation and two previous glaciations. Irregular hills and ridges (kames) surround kettles, depressions left by melting blocks of ice during the glaciers' retreat. Flora and fauna Lake Maria State Park in winter The park's vegetation consists of Big Woods (maple, basswood, elm) mixed with old-growth oaks and dotted with numerous wetlands, ponds, and small lakes. The park is located near the northern limit of the Big Woods. The forest edge and wetland habitats support mammalian species including white- tailed deer, red fox, fisher, mole, gopher, mink, beaver, woodchuck, and muskrat. 205 bird species have been identified in the park. The park is noted for its population of Blanding's turtles, considered an endangered or threatened species by many U.S. states and Canada. Cultural history The park was first proposed in 1947 in a deal in which the U.S. Forest Service would acquire the land and trade it to the state for state-owned land within Superior National Forest. The deal fell through because the USFS would not use eminent domain to buy the land from the various current owners. Lake Maria State Park was re-authorized in a 1963 bill that authorized fourteen state parks. Land acquisition through eminent domain began and the park officially opened in 1971. The concept for the park emphasized conservation over recreation, and so hike-in campsites were made in lieu of a drive-in campground. The park was expanded to the north and west in 1980 to include the whole shoreline of Maria Lake. Incidentally the lake originally called Maria Lake was renamed Bjorkland Lake by the DNR, and \\"Maria Lake\\" became an arm of Silver Lake, which lies mostly outside the park's western boundary. Recreation A walk-in campsite overlooking Bjorkland Lake Lake Maria State Park does not have a traditional drive-in campground. Instead 17 backpacking sites and three camper cabins are scattered throughout the park, only accessible by a hike of . Two primitive group camps are accessible by road, each accommodating groups of up to 50 people. A picnic area along the shore of Lake Maria features fire rings, grills, and drinking water. Maria Lake has a public boat ramp and some rental canoes. Only outboard motors under are allowed on the lake. Bjorkland Lake has a canoe launch but watercraft must be portaged in. There is a fishing pier on Maria Lake near the picnic area. Game fish in Maria and Bjorkland include crappie, bass, bluegill, northern pike, bullhead, and perch. The park has of trails, of which are open to horseback riding. The Zumbrunnen and Forest Shadow Trails each boast interpretive signage. The park's trail center features interpretive displays, modern restrooms, and indoor picnic tables. It is open all year, serving as a warming hut in the winter. Lake Maria State Park accommodates a variety of winter activities. of trail are groomed for cross-country skiing. are groomed specifically for skate skiing. of trail are packed for hiking or snowshoeing, and snowshoers can roam anywhere in the park provided they stay off the groomed ski trails. A pond near the trail center serves as an ice rink with outdoor lighting.

Regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time, he is famous for having been one of the most successful head coaches in Italy, winning several domestic and international titles during his tenure with A.C. Milan. At Padova, he was one of the first proponents of catenaccio in the country. Playing career=Club Rocco playing for Triestina in the 1930s Rocco played as a winger in midfield; he had a modest playing career, spent mainly with Triestina, Napoli and Padova. He played 287 Serie A matches within 11 seasons, scoring 69 goals. Rocco was also capped one time for the Italy national football team. International Rocco made an appearance for the Italy national team on one occasion: in Vittorio Pozzo's selection in the 1934 FIFA World Cup qualification match, on 25 March 1934 against Greece, a 4–0 home victory.Le vicende della partita \\"Italia-Grecia\\" nei quattro goals del trionfo \\"azzurro\\", Il Littoriale, 26 marzo 1934, pag.3Italia-Grecia 4-0 Italia1910.com Coaching career=Triestina Rocco made his coaching debut for Triestina in 1947. He obtained a surprising second place in Serie A, which is still the highest result ever reached by the team. He left Triestina a few years later because of disagreements with the club chairmanship. In 1951 he briefly coached Treviso, then returning to Triestina. Padova In 1953 Rocco signed as coach of Serie B team Padova, being able to avoid a relegation and obtaining promotion into Serie A the following season. The Serie A period of Rocco's Padova is still remembered as the team's most successful in their history, despite having a small team, they were able to take third place during the 1957–58 season. During his time with Padova, he also coached the Italian team at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, alongside Giuseppe Viani, where they finished in fourth place. A.C. Milan Pierino Prati and Rocco in training with A.C. Milan in the 1967–68 season In 1961, Rocco was appointed as new A.C. Milan coach, starting one of the most successful periods for the rossoneri: he built a hard-working and defensively sound side around the team's young star playmaker, Gianni Rivera, which complemented the midfielders' creative playing style; Rocco formed an important relationship with Rivera throughout his career, and together, they played a key role in the club's successes, winning the Italian league in 1962 and the European Cup in 1963. After a good stint at Torino, where he obtained the best results since the disappearance of the Grande Torino, in 1967 Rocco returned to Milan, where he immediately won another scudetto and the Cup Winners' Cup. He left Milan in 1973, after having won also another European Cup in 1969, an Intercontinental Cup, an Italian Cup and another Cup Winners' Cup. After one year in Fiorentina, Rocco decided to end his coaching career in 1975. In 1977, he was appointed by Milan as Technical Director and Assistant of coach Nils Liedholm. Rocco is Milan's longest-serving manager, managing the club for 459 matches (323 as head coach and 136 as technical director). Style of management Rocco was one of first proponents of catenaccio in Italy, and used the tactic to great success; drawing from Karl Rappan's tactics, his teams made use of a sweeper, who would sit behind the defensive line and clear the ball away, often using a 1–3–3–3 formation. His teams were known for their work-rate and physicality, as well as their simple but effective and pragmatic tactical strategies, namely their defensive strength, ability to counter–attack quickly with long balls, and score goals after winning back possession, rather than for being aesthetically pleasing to watch. During his time with Milan, he made use of Rivera as the team's playmaker in midfield, who took on the creative responsibilities of the team. He was known to be an excellent motivator, and developed strong personal relationships with his players in order to create a good team environment and foster a winning mentality, often discussing the team's tactics and the players man–marking roles over dinner rather than at a white–board during training sessions. In addition to his tactical intelligence, Rocco was also known for his charismatic personality, leadership, and sense of humour, despite his shy personality, and was known for being a very animated figures on the bench during matches. He also became popular for his quips, which he would often say to his players and journalists. Rocco, popularly known as El Paròn (Triestin for The Master), was also popular for his strong use of his native Triestine dialect. Death and Legacy Rocco died on 20 February 1979, aged 66, in his hometown Trieste. On 18 October 1992, a new stadium in Trieste, named after Rocco, was inaugurated. Rocco's tactics heavily influenced manager Giovanni Trapattoni, who became one of the main proponents of the zona mista (\\"mixed zone,\\" in Italian), or gioco all'italiana, which drew elements from both man-to-man marking systems such as Italian catenaccio, and zonal-marking systems such as Dutch total football.

Some of his most popular films include Machuca, Violeta se fue a los cielos, and Historias de Futbol. He created his own production company known as Wood Producciones in 1993.  Early life and education  Born in Santiago, Chile, Wood is Chilean of Irish and Scottish descent. He grew up in a middle-class home and credits much of his artistic influence to his childhood in Chile based on the political climate of the country, specifically with the Pinochet dictatorship. Wood's father worked as an architect while his mother taught kindergarten. Both of his parents were conservative and favored an end to the Allende government. However, Wood had the opportunity to study at elite but progressive institutions throughout his life. Andres Wood attended Saint George's College. He graduated as an economist from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1988. In 1991 he attended New York University, majoring in film production.  Career  While most of his work is focused on film, Andres Wood is also responsible for producing the most popular television series in Chile called \\"Los 80\\" (Wood Producciones). In addition, Andres Wood's most recent project involves directing a miniseries based on human rights lawyer Carmen Hertz, titled Ecos Del Desierto. The film is a part of the special programming marking the 40th anniversary of the military takeover in Chile during the 1970s. \\"Ecos del Desierto\\" is the most expensive project in Chile costing $200 thousand per episode. Cinema production in Chile is still dependent on production companies overseas. Many of Wood's projects are productions with international entities. His primary concern is preserving the authenticity of the films. Wood is part of the post-dictatorship generation whose filmmakers are concerned with highlighting the impact that the Pinochet dictatorship between 1973 and 1989 had on Chilean society and how society can \\"work through\\" the trauma by reliving it on the screen.  Influence  Wood has always been a film lover and fell in love with the process of filmmaking. Wood describes his artistic process as the following: \\"First I get in love with the characters, then with small anecdotes and at the end something like the context. I do believe that film has to be very personal.\\" Moreover, Wood believes that cinema can help to create discussion and with that, changes in society. Machuca, Andres Wood's most successful film by high box office sales and international recognition, takes place during the 1970s and is based on his own experiences at Saint George's College. The film exemplifies the Pinochet dictatorship's influence on his films. When asked about the recurring political theme dealing with the Pinochet dictatorship in his projects, Andres Wood explained: Andres Wood's Machuca was named one of the Top 20 Latin American films and as a result, some believe this places him as one of the greatest Latin American directors of his generation.

The mine is known as Minnesota's oldest, deepest, and richest iron mine, and now hosts the Soudan Underground Laboratory. As the Soudan Iron Mine, it has been designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark. History Lake Superior Iron Ranges The headframe for shaft #8, still in active use today In the late 19th century, prospectors searching for gold in northern Minnesota discovered extremely rich veins of hematite at this site, often containing more than 65% iron. An open pit mine began operation in 1882, and moved to underground mining by 1900 for safety reasons. From 1901 until the end of active mining in 1962, the Soudan Mine was owned by the United States Steel Corporation's Oliver Iron Mining division. By 1912 the mine was at a depth of 1,250 feet (381 m).Van Barneveld, Charles E. (1913) Iron Mining in Minnesota, 199. University of Minnesota. When the mine closed, level 27 was being developed at 2,341 feet (713.5 m) below the surface and the entire underground workings consisted of more than fifty miles of drifts, adits, and raises. In 1965, US Steel donated the Soudan Mine to the State of Minnesota to use for educational purposes. The primary underground mining method used was known as cut and fill. This involved mining the ceiling and using Ely Greenstone and other waste rock to artificially raise the floor at the same rate as the ceiling was being mined out. As a result, the floor and ceiling were always 10–20 feet (3–6 m) apart. There was no need to move waste rock to the surface, because it was moved short distances and left in place. This technique was particularly suited to the Soudan Mine due to the strength of the hematite formations and the weakness of the encasing Greenstone. This method was not possible in the nearby mines in Ely because the iron formations there were fractured and thus were not as structurally stable as those at Soudan. State park The park is in Breitung Township, on the shore of Lake Vermilion in northern Minnesota's Vermilion Range. It has become a popular tourist site, often visited on the way to and from Ely and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The state park is operated under the Department of Natural Resources. It is a National Historic Landmark, meaning that it is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The surface buildings are open to the public, and during the summer months there are daily tours of the mine. Visitors are lowered in an 80-year-old electric mine hoist to level 27, the mine's lowest level at 2,341 feet (713.5 m) below ground. Two tours are open to the public: one that explores the historic mining facilities, and another that focuses on the currently active underground physics laboratory.  Underground laboratory  MINOS Detector Surface outcrop, folded Soudan Iron-Formation, age about 2.69 billion years. Scratches are from glaciation. In the 1980s, scientists from the University of Minnesota began to develop the Soudan Mine as a site for sensitive physics experiments because of the very low rate of cosmic rays in the deep underground site. The mine was originally home to the Soudan 1 proton decay experiment and its successor, Soudan 2 which operated from 1989-2001. The University and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources have since expanded the laboratory to accommodate other physics projects, such as the MINOS neutrino detector, dark matter search experiments CDMS-II, SuperCDMS, and CoGeNT, and also a work on electroforming copper to create pure radiation free copper. Low-background materials screening facilities are in use and continuing development. The mine was proposed as one possible site for a U.S. Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory, but that project has since been awarded to the Homestake Mine (South Dakota). Parts of the laboratory are open for daily tours, and there is an annual open house with more access to the facilities and representatives of the experiments to help with the tours and answer questions.  2011 fire  A fire broke out late on March 17, 2011, in the main shaft at the 25th level. The fire was smothered using 70,000 gallons of foam and a major cleanup of the area around the bottom of the shaft (27th level) was necessary, as it filled with dense foam from floor to ceiling. The Underground Laboratory lost power but remained safe. The mine tours were closed for the summer of 2011, but the above ground tours and interpretive center reopened. Underground tours resumed on May 26, 2012.

It was founded by the group around Guy Aldred's Spur newspaper – mostly former Communist League members – in 1921. They included John McGovern. The group sent delegates to the Third Congress of the Comintern, but refused to join the Communist Party of Great Britain on the grounds of the latter's parliamentarianism and aim to join the Labour Party. The APCF later declared itself against \\"Leninism\\", which it claimed had distorted any gains made by the October Revolution. The group began publishing Commune, with contributions from left communists across Europe, and moved towards council communism. Aldred left in 1933, claiming that parliamentarianism was finished, and there was therefore no point in an anti- parliamentary group. He later founded the United Socialist Movement. Adopting an increasingly anarcho-communist outlook, the group supported the Spanish Popular Front, working with Freedom, but later some anarchists in the APCF split away, and the group adopted a more critical approach to the CNT. Ernst Schneider, a seaman and veteran of the German Revolution joined the group following his departure from Nazi Germany in 1939. He was a consistent contributor to the federations journal Solidarity and in 1943 published an account of the Wilhelmshaven mutiny. In 1941, the group renamed itself the Workers' Revolutionary League. The League opposed World War II, during which it published the Solidarity newspaper, but dissolved in 1945 when the revolutionary upsurge they had predicted failed to occur. Some former members founded a Workers' Open Forum to continue political activity. This continued until the late 1950s.

He is an alumnus of Indiana University, where he was a standout for the Hoosiers baseball team. Career=Chicago Cubs The Chicago Cubs selected Orie with the 29th pick in the first round of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft.https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/o/orieke01.shtml?redir Orie made his Major League Baseball debut on April 1, , as a member of the Chicago Cubs. It was in his rookie year of 1997 that Orie would put up his best career statistics. In 114 games played, Orie compiled a .275 batting average with 8 home runs and 44 RBI. Orie was a finalist in the 1997 MLB Rookie of the Year Award balloting, losing out to the eventual winner, Scott Rolen. Orie had a role in Kerry Wood's near perfect game on May 6, 1998, where he threw a one-hit, no walk, 20-strikeout shutout against the Houston Astros, tying Roger Clemens' record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game and breaking Bill Gullickson's single- game rookie record of 18 strikeouts in 1980. Wood allowed only two baserunners: an infield single by Ricky Gutierrez, and he hit Craig Biggio. The single went off third baseman Orie's glove. Florida Marlins Through the first 64 games of the season, Orie got off to a dismal start, compiling only a .181 batting average in over 200 at-bats. Subsequently, on the last day before the July 31 trading deadline, the Cubs sent Orie and minor leaguer Todd Noel to the Florida Marlins for Félix Heredia and minor leaguer Steve Hoff. After concluding the 1998 season with the Marlins, Orie would remain with Florida for the entire season, tallying a .254 batting average with 6 home runs and 29 RBI while appearing in 77 games. Free agency After the 1999 season, the Marlins needed to make room for their future third baseman, Mike Lowell, making Orie expendable. On November 12, 1999, the Marlins sent Orie to the Los Angeles Dodgers as part of a conditional deal. Although Orie put together an impressive spring training with the Dodgers prior to the season, the club already had two established third basemen on their roster: Adrián Beltré & Dave Hansen. Thus, the Dodgers released Orie on March 29, 2000, days before the season would begin. Two months later, on June 15, 2000, Orie signed a free agent contract with the Kansas City Royals, only to be released two months later. The next suitor for Orie turned out to be the New York Yankees, who signed Orie two days after his Royals release. He would remain in the Yankees minor league system the entire 2000 season, without making a single appearance at the major league level. After the 2000 season, Orie would once again be released. He would sign another free agent contract prior to the season with the Philadelphia Phillies, and once again spend the length of the season in the minor leagues. He would then be released. On November 19, 2001, Orie would be signed by one of his old teams, the Chicago Cubs. He would appear in 13 games with the Cubs in , serving as a backup to starting third baseman Bill Mueller. On March 12, , Orie's second stint with the Cubs would end. Over the next three years, Orie would be signed by three more teams: the Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros, and Milwaukee Brewers. He would not appear in the majors with any of the teams. 2006 Spring training in preparation for the 2006 season would find Orie once again in camp with the Houston Astros. Although Orie had played in only 13 major league games since the 1999 season concluded, he compiled impressive numbers every year in the minor leagues. Many thought that Orie still had the potential to stick in the major leagues and serve as a valuable backup third baseman for a number of teams. Orie didn't make the Astros and was assigned to the Triple-A Round Rock Express. Orie retired after the first game of the season. Post- retirement Orie is an associate specializing in retail with real estate management firm Grubb Ellis in Pittsburgh and later served as the pregame and postgame announcer for 93.7 The Fan in Pittsburgh.

The sentence was subsequently shortened to 35 years in prison when an appeal court upheld a lesser charge for aiding and abetting genocide. Early life and education Krstić was born in Vlasenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He attended primary school in Vlasenica and elementary school in Han Pijesak, where he also completed his secondary education in a grammar school. Krstić describes his young years as very peaceful, and the community in which he lived as \\"heterogeneous\\" and very tolerant, particularly among the youth.ICTY official site: \\"Trial of Radislav Krstić Transcript\\", icty.org, 16 October 2000. In 1968, upon completion of his secondary education, he began his university education by enrolling in the military academy in Belgrade. He graduated in 1972, whereupon he became an active duty officer of the former JNA. Personal life Krstić is married and has a daughter named Tamara. His brother-in-law is former Drina Corps Chief of Intelligence Lieutenant Colonel Svetozar Kosorić. His wife died in 2005. Career  Krstić was first assigned to the Sarajevo garrison from 1972 to 1981, where he attended secondary military school at the hub there which was called \\"Josip Broz Tito\\". His first assignment was a platoon commander at this secondary military school. He was also a company commander, and was head of his class during his graduating year. Krstić remembers Sarajevo as being unique in Yugoslavia due to spirit of unity amongst the ethnically diverse population. Krstić's tour of duty in Sarajevo ended in 1981 when he was posted to the general staff of the Military Academy of Serbia. While this assignment was very sought-after by career- minded military officers, Krstić insisted that his family remain in Sarajevo, in the hopes that he might be reassigned there. Upon completion of his education in 1983, however, he was assigned to Negotin, a small town positioned on the borders of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Romania. In mid-1986, Krstić was reassigned to Priština, in Kosovo, in charge of training of officers and units in the Priština corps. Due to the unrest that had begun brewing in that region, he was posted to Kosovska Mitrovica in early 1987 as Chief of Staff of the Motorised Brigade. He remained at that post until 1990 when he took over as the brigade commander of that garrison.  Role in the Yugoslav wars  Joining the VRS = In mid-1992, after Bosnia proclaimed independence, Krstić decided that, rather than trying to find a place in this new Yugoslavia, as he was born in Bosnia and considered himself to be a citizen of Bosnia, he would return to Bosnia. He stayed with family in Han Pijesak for a short time, and in June 1992 with the war already in full swing, he reported to the Han Pijesak garrison and joined the Army of Republika Srpska. He was immediately assigned with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel to the post of the Commander of the 2nd Romanija Motorized Brigade, which was located in the Sokolac garrison. This brigade was a new experience for Krstić, as it was ethnically homogenous; composed only of ethnic Serbs from the Sokolac municipality, Olovo and Kladanj municipalities, and from the refugees from the Zenica, Kakanj, Breza, and Vareš municipalities. = Early engagements = Krstić initially had command and control functional problems due to the inexperience of the officers in the brigade command and their subordinate units, but the situation rapidly improved, and in October of the same year he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. On the Serbian Orthodox holiday of St. Ilija's Day in August 1993, behind the positions of Krstić's units that were engaged in the front line in the area of Kladanj, there was a synchronised infiltration of Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the villages in the territory of the Han Pijesak municipality, such as Žerovice, Rijeka, and Potkosovaca were destroyed and most of their inhabitants killed. In late April of the following year there was a significant effort by the Eastern Bosnia Corps to break through the Kladanj front to capture Vlasenica and link up from the direction of Kladanj with the forces within the protected area of Žepa. The offensive lasted for about 20 days, and it was crushed on 20 May. = UN \\"Safe Area\\" warnings = On 15 August 1994, Krstić was appointed Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps. Krstić worked with his replacement to familiarize him with his roles and function until 1 September, and then worked with the former Chief of Staff whom he would be replacing to learn his new post until 28 September. He was then briefed about Bosnian operations coming from the direction of Tuzla, Živinice, Kladanj, and Olovo against Serbian civilians. His predecessor also briefed him and told him that, despite the status of the safe area accorded to Srebrenica and Žepa and the obligations stemming from agreements on demilitarization, the forces of the 28th Mountain Division of the Eastern Bosnia Corps in Srebrenica and Žepa were, in fact procuring from Tuzla and Kladanj or directly from Sarajevo more weapons in addition to the light or infantry weapons they already had. There were numerous reports from Serb intelligence sources of the BiH Army troop movements in and out of protected enclaves carrying arms, reconnoitering Serb positions, and other military actions against Tuzla, Živinice, and Kladanj, all using UN protectorates as a base of operations in the region and operating under the radar so as to avoid notice by UNPROFOR. Krstić stayed at his post at the Corps Command until 1 November 1994, whereupon he established a brigade and took it to the area of the Herzegovinian Corps for the purpose of combatting the offensive which was being conducted by the Eastern Bosnia Corps from the area of Bjelašnica and Igman towards Treskavica and Trnovo. He remained in the area of Treskavica and Trnovo until mid-December 1994, whereupon he returned to his post as the commander of the Corps in Vlasenica. He was again briefed about the situation with operations that the Bosniak command of the 28th Division in Srebrenica, acting upon orders from the Main Staff of the 2nd Corps in Tuzla, was conducting towards the positions of the Drina Corps, in particular the Milici municipality, Han Pijesak, and the Vlasenica municipality. He was also briefed about intel on the continuation of the army and weapons and ammunitions supply to the protected area to the members of the 28th Brigade. They began intercepting communications indicating an attempt by the BiH Army to conduct supply chain operations from Tuzla to link up with their forces in Srebrenica in an operation named \\"Skakavac\\" (grasshopper). = Landmine injury = On 29 December 1994, while inspecting force deployment at Kladanj and Olovo, Krstić stepped on a landmine and was seriously wounded. He was taken to a military hospital in Sokolac where, on 3 January, his right leg below his knee was amputated. He stayed in the military hospital in Meljine until the end of March 1995 when he was transferred to the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade, remaining there until the end of April 1995. He was discharged from the military hospital at his request and stayed for a couple of days with his family in Kosovska Mitrovica, and then returned to Bosnia with his wife to report to his doctors in Sokolac and Vlasenica for further treatment. He underwent therapy alternately in Sokolac and Vlasenica until the middle of May 1995, when he returned to his official post. = The Bosnian Army offensive = Upon returning to his official duties, Krstić was again briefed that activity by Bosnian Muslim forces between Tuzla and the UN protectorates was increasing, and Serb forces were suffering heavy losses to infiltrators.ICTY official site: \\"Trial of Radislav Krstić Transcript\\", 17 October 2000 Serb intelligence reported that, despite a no-fly order on much of the area, BiH military helicopters were landing in protected areas daily with munitions and supplies. Noting the buildup toward a major offensive by the BiH Army, the Drina Corps began preparations for a counter-offensive. On 15 June 1995, forces of the 2nd Corps of the BiH Army launched simultaneous offensives against the 1st Brčanska Brigade, the 1st Zvornik Infantry Brigade, and the 1st Vlasenica Brigade along the Tuzla-Zvornik and Kladanj-Vlasenica axes.ICTY official site: \\"Trial of Radislav Krstić Transcript\\", 18 October 2000 There were casualties suffered on both sides, but the Drina Corps made territorial gains in the Kalesija and Osmaci municipalities, and after four days of fighting the 2nd Corps was driven back to their original positions. The Eastern Bosnia Corps then concentrated their forces on the Tuzla-Zvornik axis, however, and after establishing a bridgehead on the Spreča River, they broke through Serb lines and destroyed the villages of Markovica, much of Osmaca, and the entire village of Zelena. The 28th Division of the 2nd Corps then occupied the villages of Višnjica and Rječice, and when they attacked the VRS Main Staff from the direction of Banja Lučica and Krivace. This territory was held until 26 June, when the Drina Corps fortified their defenses and managed to halt and then repel the BiH Army back to their initial positions. = Operation Krivaja 95 = Since the UN-protected enclaves of Srebrenica and Žepa were never demilitarized, and that they hid what amounted to \\"five or six brigades\\" of BiH Army troops and weapons, the VRS Main Staff ordered the Drina Corps Command to undertake an operation codenamed Krivaja 95. This was in response to an 8 March 1995 directive from the Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadžić himself (although it is believed that Krstić was a co- planner), ordering that \\"The Command of the Drina Corps, pursuant to operations directive number 7 and 7/1 of the GS VRS, and on the basis of the situation in the Corps area of responsibility has the task of carrying out offensive activities with free forces deep in the Drina Corps zone, as soon as possible, in order to split apart the enclaves of Žepa and Srebrenica, and to reduce them to their urban areas.\\"ICTY official site: \\"Trial of Radislav Krstić Transcript\\", 25 October 2000\\" The directive went on to detail the \\"complete the physical separation of the Srebrenica and Žepa enclaves as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals between the two enclaves. By planned and well-thought-out combat operations, create an unbearable situation of total insecurity, with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica or Žepa.ICTY official site: \\"ICTY Prosecution Indictment Against Zdravko Tolimir, Radivoje Miletić and Milan Gvero\\" \\" The operational objective was to \\"By a surprise attack, to separate and reduce in size military forces in Srebrenica and Žepa enclaves\\" whose purpose was to \\"To improve the tactical position of the forces in the depth of the area and to create conditions for the elimination of the enclaves.\\" Mission parameters included a very accelerated timetable, complete radio silence, a ban on targeting UNPROFOR forces, and the operation was to be managed by several commanders, Krstić among them, from a forward command post in Pribicevac. There was also psychological components to the operation plan. The directive laid out support for combat operations by ordering that \\"The relevant state and military organs responsible for work with UNPROFOR and humanitarian organisations shall, through the planned and unobtrusively restrictive issuing of permits, reduce and limit the logistics support of UNPROFOR to the enclaves and the supply of material and weapons to the Muslim armies that are hiding inside the safe area, making them dependent on our goodwill while at the same time avoiding condemnation by the International Community and international public opinion.\\" It is believed that operations to this effect actually began three months before the attack in April 1995. Reconnaissance was carried out from the forward command post at Pribicevac, Besica Brdo, and the Bracan surface mine.ICTY official site: \\"Trial of Radislav Krstić Transcript\\", 19 October 2000 Following this, the Drina Corps requested that the VRS provide the cooperation of the 65th Protective Motorised Regiment, as well as that of the 1st and 2nd Podrinje Light Infantry Brigades. A sudden flare-up of fierce resistance by the BiH Army against all VRS axes delayed the commencement of the operation by several days, and resources were concentrated on re-acquiring territory lost in these attacks.... = Srebrenica = On 9 July, around 1700 hours, General Ratko Mladić, commander of the VRS Main Staff arrived without advance notice at the forward command post in Pribicevac along with other senior VRS Generals to monitor combat operations. Once commanders radioed from the battle theater that they had accomplished their given tasks, Mladić radioed back \\"This is Panorama 01. You haven't accomplished your task. Continue the attack. Enter Srebrenica. I am now in command of the forces engaged in this operation.\\" Resistance by the Eastern Bosnia Corps' 28th Division was finally beginning to flag, and Mladić had just effectively relegated Krstić to the role of an observer. Throughout the night and the next day, the VRS pressed forward, making gains in enough key areas to control all the needed strategic positions to take Srebrenica. It was at this point that NATO fighter pilots in F-16s began flying over combat operations. On 11 July 1995 the Bratunac Light Infantry Brigade, reinforced by a unit from the Vlasenica Light Infantry Brigade, began a final push into Srebrenica from the Southeast. At 1430 the two F-16s conducted air strikes against VRS tanks, inflicting some damage during the thirty-minute attack, to which Mladić responded by ordering ground troops to take air attack defense measures, such as the burning of haystacks to create smokescreens. The Drina Wolves from the 1st Battalion of the Zvornik Brigade were the first VRS soldiers to enter the town of Srebrenica around 1600 that day. After the area was cleared and more forces arrived, Krstić and the other Generals departed the forward command post and reassembled in Srebrenica. Mladić immediately ordered the brigade commanders to press the attack onward to Potočari and Bratunac, but after logistical and other considerations raised by Krstić and Živanović, Mladić ordered troops to hold and stabilize their present lines. That night at a meeting with Mladić, Krstić was placed in charge of infantry forces that would be conducting an overnight march toward Žepa in preparation for combat operations there. At this meeting it was also decided that Živanović would oversee the procurement of buses to remove civilians from Srebrenica to Kladanj. It is known that Krstić visited Potočari at least once, he gave a television interview there, but it is not known the extent of his involvement in the ensuing Srebrenica Massacre. It is known that the VRS separated the adult male refugees in Potočari from the others, and the latter were loaded to buses and transported to Kladanj. The former were taken in groups to isolated locations such as Čerska Valley, Kravica warehouse, Orahovac, Branjevo Farm, Petkovci Dam and Kozluk, blindfolded, and executed. The current body count stands at just over 3,000, with over two thousand more missing. Seized VRS documentsICTY official site: \\"Tribunal Update 131 (30 June 2000)\\" indicated that there were major logistical considerations provided for with regard to fueling of transport trucks, transporting prisoners, equipment to move earth for mass graves, as well as the assignment and provisioning of ammunition for the executions. The following coded communication was intercepted over unsecured lines between VRS Main Staff Security Chief Ljubiša Beara and Krstić in which Beara was requesting assistance with disposing of prisoners: RK: I will see what I can do, but it will disturb a lot. Please, you have some men down there at Nastić's and Blagojević's. LB: But I don't have any, and if I did—or if I did, I wouldn't still be asking for the third day. RK: Check with Blagojevic, take his Red Berets. LB: They're not there. Only four of them are still there. They took off, fuckers. They're not there anymore. RK: I'll see what I can do. LB: Check it out and have them go to Drago's. Krle, I don't know what to do anymore. RK: Ljubo, take those MUP guys from up there. LB: No, they won't do anything. I talked to them. There is no other solution but those 15 to 30 men with Indjić. RK: Ljubo, you have to understand me, too. You guys have fucked me up so much. LB: I understand, but you have to understand me, too. Had this been done then, we wouldn't be arguing over it now. RK: Oh, now I'll be the one to blame. LB: I don't know what to do. I mean it, Krle, there are still 3,500 parcels that I have to distribute and I have no solution. RK: I'll see what I can do.ICTY official site: \\"Trial of Vidoje Blagojević and Dragan Jokić Transcript\\" 13 November 2003 Krstić then allegedly undertook to arrange that men from the Bratunac Brigade assist with the Branjevo Farm and the Pilica Dom executions. = Stupcanica 95 = Over the next few days Krstić assembled the commanders from several brigades present in the area that would be contributing some or all of their forces to the Žepa attack (now codenamed Stupcanica 95), including the 1st Zvornik Infantry Brigade, the Bratunac Light Infantry Brigade, the Birač Infantry Brigade, the 2nd Romanija Motorised Brigade, the 1st Podrinje Light Infantry Brigade, the 5th Podrinje Light Infantry Brigade, the 1st Milici Light Infantry Brigade, the 1st Vlasenica Light Infantry Brigade, and the 5th Mixed Artillery Regiment. In Viogora they assembled the Bratunac Brigade, the Milici Brigade, and the Independent Skelani Battalion, marched southward, and arrived at the wider assembly area of Podravanje, Rupovo Brdo, and Bracan.ICTY official site: \\"Trial of Radislav Krstić Transcript\\", 20 October 2000 They would be attacking along the line of Podravanje-Orlov Kamen, Zlovrh and on to Žepa. On 13 July there was a flurry of preparatory measures involving scouring the terrain for remaining members of the 28th Division, organizing mine groups to detect minefields and conduct demining operations, removing obstacles on roads within the protected area as well as roads between units and the staging area for the Žepa operation. Numerous executions of bound prisoners also took place in this region. On 19 July the following conversation between Krstić and Deputy Commander of the 1st Zvornik Infantry Brigade General Dragan Obrenović was intercepted: RK: Is that you, Obrenović? DO: Yes. RK: Krstić here. DO: How are you General, sir? RK: I'm great, and you? DO: Thanks to you I am too. RK: Way to go, Chief. And how's your health? DO: It's fine, thank God, it's fine. RK: Are you working down there? DO: Of course we're working. RK: Good. DO: We've managed to catch a few more, either by gunpoint or in mines. RK: Kill them all. God damn it. DO: Everything, everything is going according to plan. Yes. RK: Not a single one must be left alive. DO: Everything is going according to plan. Everything. RK: Way to go, Chief. The Turks are probably listening to us. Let them listen, the motherfuckers. DO: Yeah, let them.ICTY official site: \\"Trial of Radislav Krstić Transcript\\" 1 November 2000 Despite losing some of his force in a transfer to augment operations in the Alibegovac and Kak areas, on the morning of 17 July, the march on Žepa commenced, with the attack building to full swing a few days later. The attack was initially slowed down due to terrain features along the attack axes. Žepa fell to the VRS on 1 August. = Promotion to Drina Corps Commander = Generals Mladić and Tolimir joined Krstić at the forward command post in Krivaca on the day the Žepa attack began and informed him that he (Krstić) would be soon taking over duties as Corps Commander. About a week later, after the forward command post had been moved to Godjenje, Mladić ordered Krstić to travel to a restaurant near Han Pijesak to take over Živanović's post as Corps Commander. There was a formal ceremony, after which Krstić performed some transitory duties and visited his family briefly in Kosovska Mitrovica.  Post-war  In August 1995, Krstić went to Zvornik and joined Obrenović in a review of the right flank of the 7th battalion trenches. A Srebrenica Massacre survivor was heard on a soldier's transistor radio giving an account over the radio broadcast from Tuzla. Krstić ordered that the radio be switched off, with the admonition that they should not listen to enemy radio. He then asked Obrenović if he had issued orders that enemy radio should not be listened to and Obrenović said that he had not. Krstić refused to discuss the executions further.ICTY official site: \\"Statement of facts as set out by Dragan Obrenović\\" Krstić was relieved of his duties as Corps Commander on 21 November 1995 and he was sent to the National Defense School in Belgrade. He returned to the Main Staff of the VRS in September 1996 for further deployment, and was appointed to the post of the Chief of Inspection for Combat Readiness of the VRS. He was appointed the Commander of the 5th Corps in April 1998.  Indictment by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia  On 1 November 1998 Krstić was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague for genocide, complicity to commit genocide, extermination, two counts of murder, and persecution. On 27 October 1999 the indictment was amended to include one count of deportation and one count of inhumane acts.ICTY official site: \\"Amended Indictment Against Radislav Krstić\\" = Arrest = On Wednesday, 2 December 1998, Krstić was driving through the village of Vršani on the Bijeljina-Brčko road while en route to Banja Luka on business when his car was disabled by road spikes and he was pulled through his car window and taken into custody in a joint SAS-Navy SEAL operation launched by SFOR. He was immediately transported to the Hague for trial. The Republika Srpska and Yugoslav governments expressed outrage, and even Russia protested against the manner in which Krstić was detained, in that it took place in an area of Bosnia patrolled by the Russian SFOR contingent, which was not apprised of the operation.Interfax News Agency, 4 December 1998 = Trial and sentence = Krstić's trial began five days after his arrest on 7 December 1998. Krstić did not deny that war crimes had been committed by the VRS, but he denied that he had issued orders for these actions. He pleaded ignorance and placed the likely responsibility on General Mladić's shoulders. He claimed that he did not participate in either the planning, organizing or ordering of killings and deportations, claiming instead that he concentrated on his attack on Žepa while the bulk of the killings were taking place. He claimed to have known and heard nothing about any atrocities until the event of his own trial. On 2 August 2001 Krstić was convicted on all counts and sentenced to 46 years in prison. On 15 August 2001, Counsel for Krstić filed a notice of appeal against the Trial Chamber judgement, arguing that the Trial Chamber both misconstrued the legal definition of genocide and erred in applying the definition to several circumstances of the case. The Appeal's Chamber dismissed the appeal with regard to the legal definition of genocide. With regard to factual errors, the Appeal's Chamber on 19 April 2004 dismissed the appeal on some issues, but granted it with regard to other issues. They pronounced him not guilty of genocide, but affirmed his guilt as an aider and abbetor to genocide, thus redefining Krstić's involvement and cutting 11 years from his sentence. Prison attack On 20 December 2004, Krstić was transferred to the United Kingdom to serve his sentence. On 7 May 2010, three Muslim inmates attacked Krstić, wounding him seriously in Wakefield prison, where he was serving the sentence. The three men - Indrit Krasniqi, Iliyas Khalid and Quam Ogumbiyi - were sent for trial at Leeds Crown Court. On 18 February 2011, the trio were found guilty of \\"wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm\\", but were acquitted of attempted murder. The judge sentenced Krasniqi to life with a specified term of 12 years, Khalid to life with a 10-year term and Ogumbiyi, who had played a smaller part in the attack, to life with a six-year term. Afterwards, Krstić was transferred back to the Netherlands, and he was later transferred to a prison in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland on 20 March 2014.

Hardin (June 21, 1780October 8, 1823) was a politician and lawyer from Kentucky. Born in Pennsylvania, his family immigrated to Kentucky when he was still young. He studied law under George Nicholas and commenced practice at Richmond, Kentucky. His cousin, future U.S. Representative Benjamin Hardin, studied in his law office. He represented Madison County in the Kentucky House of Representatives for a single term. Hardin later moved to Frankfort and was elected to the Kentucky House to represent Franklin County. Governor Isaac Shelby appointed him Secretary of State soon after his election. Concurrent with his service, he participated in the War of 1812, serving alongside future Kentucky Governor George Madison as majors in Colonel John Allen's militia unit. Following the expiration of his term as Secretary of State, Governor Gabriel Slaughter appointed Hardin to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by William T. Barry, who resigned. Hardin served the remainder of Barry's term - approximately one year - and did not seek re-election. In 1819, he was elected to the Kentucky House for a third time and was chosen Speaker of the House. He died October 8, 1823. Hardin married the daughter of Kentucky pioneer Benjamin Logan, and their son, John J. Hardin, represented Illinois in the U.S. House of Representatives before being killed at the Battle of Buena Vista. In his book Life of Lincoln, Ward Hill Lamon speculated that future President Abraham Lincoln may have been the illegitimate child of Hardin and Nancy Hanks, but the rumor was later debunked. Early life and family Hardin was born June 21, 1780, along the Monongahela River in western Pennsylvania.\\"Hardin, Martin D.\\". Biographical Directory of the United States Congress He was the eldest son of Colonel John and Jane (Davies) Hardin.Little, p. 23 Named for his grandfather, he adopted the middle initial \\"D.\\" to distinguish between them.\\"Martin D. Hardin\\". Dictionary of American Biography The Hardin family moved to Kentucky in April 1786, settling near the present-day city of Springfield in Washington (then Nelson) County.Kleber, p. 403 Hardin matriculated to Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in Lexington, Kentucky. Afterward, he read law with George Nicholas. He was admitted to the bar in 1801 and commenced practice in Richmond, Kentucky. Among those who read law in his office were his cousin, U.S. Representative Benjamin Hardin; and future Kentucky Governor and Postmaster General Charles A. Wickliffe.Little, pp. 22, 204 Although he was not particularly politically ambitious, Hardin was elected to represent Madison County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1805, serving a single term. He was chosen clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1808.Green, p. 178 In 1810, he published Reports of Cases Argued and Adjudged in the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, covering the proceedings of the court between the years of 1805 and 1808. On January 20, 1809, he married Elizabeth Logan, daughter of famed Kentucky pioneer Benjamin Logan.Kleber, p. 404Barton, p. 200 Their eldest son, John J. Hardin, represented Illinois in the U.S. House of Representatives and was killed in the Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican–American War. In his work Life of Lincoln, Ward Hill Lamon promoted the notion that Abraham Lincoln was an illegitimate child of Nancy Hanks; Hardin was proffered as Lincoln's potential father. In a 1920 essay, William Barton opines that Hardin's paternity was unlikely since both he and Hanks were married at the time, and because Hardin's usual travels - to his law practice in Richmond and to state business in Frankfort - took him in the opposite direction of Nancy Hanks- Lincoln's house. The rumor arose from an inability to locate Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks' marriage license at the courthouse in Hardin County, Kentucky; the license was later found in the courthouse in Washington County, effectively discrediting the rumor.Barton, p. 201 Political career Politically, Hardin favored the construction of internal improvements at federal expense and adhered to a loose interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. His entry in the 1936 Dictionary of American Biography notes that, while some of his fellow Kentuckians believed he was a Federalist, Hardin was actually a national Democrat who probably would have associated with the Whig Party had he lived long enough to see its formation. In April 1812, as the War of 1812 became more imminent, Hardin wrote to Isaac Shelby, Kentucky's first governor and a hero of the Revolutionary War, asking him to consent to being a candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election.Connelley and Coulter, p. 552 Shelby went on to win the election, and Hardin, who had by this time relocated to Frankfort, was elected to represent Franklin County in the Kentucky House. In August 1812, shortly after the election, Shelby appointed Hardin Secretary of State. According to Shelby's executive journal, Hardin resigned on or before February 3, 1813.\\"Secretary of State Martin D. Hardin\\". Kentucky Secretary of State The next day, Shelby nominated Hardin's assistant, former Governor Christopher Greenup, to replace him. Greenup served only a month, resigning on March 11, 1813, after which Hardin was re-appointed and served for the remainder of Shelby's term. Hardin volunteered for service in the War of 1812. He was one of two majors serving under John Allen; future Kentucky Governor George Madison was the other.Green, p. 179 Hardin's unit pursued Tecumseh through northern Ohio and Michigan and participated in the Battle of the River Raisin. On November 13, 1816, Governor Gabriel Slaughter appointed Hardin to the U.S. Senate seat vacated when William T. Barry resigned. The appointment was only effective until the General Assembly convened later that year. When the Kentucky Senate convened, the senators elected him to serve out the remainder of Barry's term. Hardin did not seek re-election at the expiration of the term. In total, he served from November 13, 1816 to March 3, 1817. In 1818, Hardin returned to the Kentucky House, serving until 1820 and acting as Speaker of the House from 1819 to 1820. Later life and death In December 1820, Hardin was a candidate to become president of the Bank of Kentucky, but John Harvie was chosen instead. The following year, he was chosen as a presidential elector, voting for James Monroe. Hardin died in Frankfort in 1823, and was interred on his farm in Franklin County, Kentucky. His remains were later re-interred in the State Cemetery in Frankfort.

Note that this is distinct from the electronically controlled focusing employed in diagnostic ultrasound devices which employ arrays of transducers. The self-focusing effect exists even for a single crystal. Self-focusing refers to the narrowing of the ultrasonic beam in the near-field. The effect occurs because, if the ultrasound wave generated by the crystal is coherent, the edges of the emitting surface generate wavelets that constructively interfere with the plane wave that is generated. The volume near the transducer which exhibits this phenomenon is called the near field, as opposed to the far field where wave intensity decays approximately exponentially. The near-field size is usually approximated by D = \\\\frac{d^2}{4 \\\\lambda} where d = crystal diameter and \\\\lambda =wavelength of the emitted wave. At the edge of the near-field, where the focusing reaches its maximum, the beam width reaches \\\\frac{d}{2}. However, there exist techniques, such as apodization that may be used to reduce the near field size.

It refers to Attributeless God or Nirguna Brahman in here. This idea comes from ancient Yoga traditions originating in Swetashwetara Upanishad. This particular Upanishad deals with Yoga, Vedantic Monotheism. It describes the Supreme Being as Sat-Chit-Ananda. – Legend has it, that the slogan or elating cry for the Supreme Being was first coined by Matsyendranath. Matsyendra is popularly regarded as the 'second Guru' of Nath Yoga Cult after Lord Shiva as Adinath. He first used the words \\"Alakh Niranjan murmu\\" to denote God as perceived by a Yoga adept in known history. His disciple is known as MahaYogi Gorakhnath, also known as Gorakshanath, without whose mention, Nath Yoga becomes unimaginable. It is Gorakhnath and Matsyendranath who popularised Kaya Sadhana throughout known limits of India and beyond. Gorakhnath actually organised and assimilated most Yogis of the Hatha Yoga and Tantra Cult into the enormous Nath tradition. The city of Gorakhpur in North India is named after the legendary Yogi. 'Alakh Niranjan' became a very popular name for God all over India during and after Gorakhnath's time. Later first Sikh Guru, Nanak used this holy name to denote God. * Famous works by Guru Matsyendranath: Kaulayogini Tantra. * Guru Gorakhnath's celebrated works are Gorakhsha Samhita, Yoga-Bija. * Guru Nanak's works include Japji Sahib.

He was a Cambridge University and Worcestershire all-rounder who bowled right-arm fast and batted right-handed, generally in the lower middle order. Life and career Born in Stamford, Lincolnshire, the sixth son of John Rooe Lowe and his wife Mary Ann Laws, Lowe was educated at Malvern College and Pembroke College, Cambridge. He then returned to Malvern as an assistant master, becoming later a house master. He taught at Malvern from 1896 to 1932. Lowe died in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, at the age of 71. Cricket Lowe made his first-class debut for Cambridge against Somerset in 1895. He finished the English season with 309 runs at 30.90 and 31 wickets at 25.32, including 5-48 in the University Match against Oxford University, and was invited to join F Mitchell's XI on a tour of North America that autumn. It was while there that Lowe recorded his best bowling figures, taking 6-15 against the Philadelphians. On his return to England, Lowe played three times for Cambridge in 1896, but was then out of the game until August 1899 when he joined Worcestershire in the county's maiden first-class season. The highlight of his summer was undoubtedly the unbeaten 102 he hit against Derbyshire, when he added 87 in barely half an hour with Robert Burrows for the ninth wicket to set up a crushing innings win, one of only two County Championship wins by the county all season. The following year Lowe made ten appearances for Worcestershire, passing 500 first-class runs for the only time in his career, and in 1901 he averaged nearly 42 with the bat and made his highest score of 154 against Leicestershire; the innings took only 150 minutes and remains (as of 2009) the highest score for Worcestershire in first-class cricket for a man batting at seven. However, his form trailed off and after 1902 he dropped out of the first-class game, though he did have a brief and unsuccessful comeback in 1910 and 1911; his only wicket in his last year being that of Test all- rounder Len Braund. Association football Lowe played soccer for the Corinthian Football Club, from 1895 to 1900. In other sports, he was noted also for golf and skating.

Illusory contours or subjective contours are visual illusions that evoke the perception of an edge without a luminance or color change across that edge. Illusory brightness and depth ordering frequently accompany illusory contours. Friedrich Schumann is often credited with the discovery of illusory contours around the beginning of the twentieth century, however illusory contours are present in art dating to the Middle Ages. Gaetano Kanizsa’s 1976 Scientific American paper marks the resurgence of interest in illusory contours for vision scientists. Common types of illusory contours=Kanizsa figures Perhaps the most famous example of an illusory contour is the Pac-Man configuration popularized by Gaetano Kanizsa. Kanizsa figurers trigger the percept of an illusory contour by aligning Pac-Man-shaped inducers in the visual field such that the edges form a shape. Though not explicitly part of the image, Kanizsa figures evoke the percept of a shape, defined by a sharp illusory contour. Typically, the shape seems brighter than the background though luminance is in reality homogeneous. Additionally, the illusory shape seem to be closer to the viewer than the inducers. Kanizsa figures involve modal completion of the illusory shape and amodal completion of the inducers. Ehrenstein illusion The Ehrenstein illusion is of a bright disc Closely related to Kanizsa figures is the Ehrenstein illusion. Instead of employing Pac-Man inducers, the Ehrenstein illusion triggers an illusory contour percept via radial line segments. Ehrenstein's discovery was originally contextualized as a modification of the Hermann grid. Abutting line gratings Illusory contours are created at the boundary between two misaligned gratings. In these so-called abutting line gratings, the illusory contour is perpendicular to the inducing elements. In art and graphic design Olympic logos from 1972, 1984, 1988, and 1994 all feature illusory contours as does Ellsworth Kelly's 1950s series. A Kanizsa illusion in the lower arms Jacob Gestman Geradts often used the Kanisza illusion in his silkscreen prints, for instance in this work Formula 1 (1991). Cortical responses It is thought that early visual cortical regions such as V1 V2 in the visual system are responsible for forming illusory contours. Studies using human neuroimaging techniques have found the illusory contours are associated with activity in the deep layers of primary visual cortex. Related visual phenomena Neon color spreading: the cyan circle's contours are illusory Visual illusions are useful stimuli for studying the neural basis of perception because they hijack the visual system's innate mechanisms for interpreting the visual world under normal conditions. For example, objects in the natural world are often only partially visible. Illusory contours provide clues for how the visual system constructs surfaces when portions of the surface's edge are not visible. The encoding of surfaces is thought to be an indispensable part of visual perception, forming a critical intermediate stage of visual processing between the initial analysis of visual features and the ability to recognize complex stimuli like faces and scenes. *Amodal perception *Autostereogram *Filling-in *Gestalt psychology *Negative space *Reification ReferencesFurther reading * * External links *Illusory contours figures Many unpublished drawings (fr) Category:Optical illusions Category:Triangles ","title":"Illusory contours"},{"id":"4417862","text":"Centella asiatica, commonly known as Indian pennywort or Asiatic pennywort, is a herbaceous, perennial plant in the flowering plant family Apiaceae. It is native to the wetlands in Asia. It is used as a culinary vegetable and as a medicinal herb. Description Centella asiatica, India Centella grows in temperate and tropical swampy areas in many regions of the world. The stems are slender, creeping stolons, green to reddish-green in color, connecting plants to each other. It has long-stalked, green, rounded apices which have smooth texture with palmately netted veins. The leaves are borne on pericladial petioles, around . The rootstock consists of rhizomes, growing vertically down. They are creamish in color and covered with root hairs. The flowers are white or crimson in color, born in small, rounded bunches (umbels) near the surface of the soil. Each flower is partly enclosed in two green bracts. The hermaphrodite flowers are minute in size, less than , with five to six corolla lobes per flower. Each flower bears five stamens and two styles. The fruit are densely reticulate, distinguishing it from species of Hydrocotyle which have smooth, ribbed or warty fruit. The crop matures in three months, and the whole plant, including the roots, is harvested manually. It is a highly invasive plant, rated as \\"high risk\\". Centella has numerous common names in its regions of distribution. Habitat Centella asiatica is indigenous to the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and wetland regions of the Southeastern US. Because the plant is aquatic, it is especially sensitive to biological and chemical pollutants in the water, which may be absorbed into the plant. It can be cultivated in drier soils as long as they are watered regularly enough (such as in a home garden arrangement). Chemistry Triterpene compounds of Centella asiatica Centella contains pentacyclic triterpenoids, including asiaticoside, brahmoside, asiuyatic acid, and brahmic acid (madecassic acid). Other constituents include centellose, centelloside, and madecassoside.  Culinary use  Bai bua bok served as a drink in Thailand In Burmese cuisine, raw pennywort is used as the main constituent in a salad mixed with onions, crushed peanuts, bean powder and seasoned with lime juice and fish sauce. Centella is used as a leafy green in Sri Lankan cuisine, being the predominantly locally available leafy green, where it is called . It is most often prepared as , a traditional accompaniment to rice and vegetarian dishes, such as , and jackfruit or pumpkin curry. It is considered nutritious. In addition to finely chopped plants, the may be eaten with grated coconut, diced shallots, lime (or lemon) juice, and sea salt. Additional ingredients are finely chopped green chilis, chili powder, turmeric powder, or chopped carrots. The centella fruit-bearing structures are discarded from the due to their intense bitter taste. A variation of porridge known as is also made with in Sri Lanka. is made with well-boiled red rice with some extra liquid, coconut milk first extract, and purée. The porridge is accompanied with jaggery for sweetness. Centella leaves are also used in modern sweet \\"pennywort\\" drinks and herbal teas. In addition the leaves are served stir- fried whole in coconut oil, or cooked in coconut milk with garlic or . In Indonesia, the leaves are used for sambai oi peuga-ga, an Aceh type of salad, and is also mixed into asinan in Bogor. In Vietnam and Thailand, this leaf is used for preparing a drink or can be eaten in raw form in salads or cold rolls. In Bangkok, vendors in the Chatuchak Weekend Market sell it alongside coconut, roselle, chrysanthemum, orange and other health drinks. In Malay cuisine it is known as pegaga, and the leaves of this plant are used for ulam, a type of vegetable salad. Centella is widely used in various Indian regional cuisines.  Traditional medicine  In traditional medicine, C. asiatica has been used to treat various disorders and minor wounds. Clinical efficacy and safety have not been confirmed by high-quality medical research. Contact dermatitis and skin irritation can result from topical application. Drowsiness may occur after consuming it. The herb may have adverse effects on liver function when used over many months.  Agriculture  In the context of phytoremediation, C. asiatica is a potential phytoextraction tool owing to its ability to take up and translocate metals from root to shoot when grown in soils contaminated by heavy metals.

Grant Memorial on the west front of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Background Shrady was born in New York City. His father, George Frederick Shrady, Sr., was one of the physicians who attended Ulysses S. Grant during the former president's struggle with throat cancer. Shrady graduated from Columbia University in 1894, and spent one year at Columbia's law school. He left law school to join with his brother-in-law, Jay Gould (son of the financier Edwin Gould), at the Continental Match Company. The company failed, and Shrady contracted typhoid fever, which diverted him forever from the business world. His recuperation left spare time to pursue a growing interest in art. Shrady's wife, Harrie Moore, submitted some of his paintings to an exhibition of the National Academy of Design without his knowledge, and they sold quickly. He then began to teach himself sculpture using zoo animals and his pets as models. He modeled a series of popular bronze statuettes, mostly of animals. His first major commission came in 1901, for George Washington at Valley Forge, an equestrian statue for Continental Army Plaza in Brooklyn, New York. Grant Memorial Grant Memorial (1902-1922), United States Capitol, Washington, DC. Shrady and architect Edward Pearce Casey won the competition to build the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial in 1902. In the twenty years Shrady spent executing its sculpture program, he studied biology at the American Museum of Natural History and dissected horses to gain a better understanding of animal anatomy. The memorial was dedicated on April 27, 1922, two weeks after Shrady's death. The Grant Memorial is described as \\"one of the most important sculptures in Washington\\" by James M. Goode in The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C. It consists of a colossal equestrian statue of Grant atop a marble pedestal with bas relief plaques, guarded by four lions. Large sculpture groups of the Cavalry and Artillery flank this to the north and south, with a reflecting pool to the west. Legacy General Alpheus S. Williams is in the background. In 1908, the Roman Bronze Works built a home and studio for Shrady at White Plains, New York. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as the Leo Friedlander Studio. Shrady's papers are in the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution. His son, Frederick Charles Shrady (1907–1990), became a sculptor.

The word \\"lanthorn\\" is derived from an old English word meaning \\"look out\\" or \\"lantern.\\" A lanthorn was constructed of leather and a lens made of ox or steer horn, it was used for lighting or as a beacon. The common pronunciation of the word on campus is lan-thorn, although the proper pronunciation is lant-horn. History The Grand Valley Lanthorn first traces its history back to November 22, 1963, with the founding of at the time Grand Valley State College's first student-run newspaper, \\"The Keystone\\". The Keystone did not last long however, and had its last edition published on January 22, 1966. It was then replaced by GVSC's second newspaper, \\"The Valley View\\", on October 28, 1966 until its last publication on June 6, 1968. In October 1968, the college changed the name again, this time to \\"The Lanthorn\\". The internet edition of the newspaper, www.lanthorn.com, appeared in 1995, and was the first online edition of a weekly Michigan collegiate newspaper. The Lanthorn grew to broadsheet size on August 27, 1997 and averaged 20–24 pages in length each week. On January 13, 2000, the newspaper changed its name for the last time to the \\"Grand Valley Lanthorn\\". The GVL expanded to publications twice per week circulating 8,000 copies per publication to both the Allendale and Grand Rapids campuses. Although GVSU is a Division II athletics school, the newspaper competes at the Division I level for the Michigan College Press Association Awards. Controversy The Lanthorn has been involved in several controversies over its history, including a First Amendment lawsuit when the Ottawa County, Michigan sheriff's department closed down the newspaper in 1969 for printing several vulgar words. GVSU sued the sheriff, and eventually, the Michigan Attorney General sided with the university in order to settle the case before it reached a court. In 2008, a new county-wide smoking ban was established, which prohibited smoking within 25 feet of building entrances. When the Lanthorn's News Editor, Michelle Hamilton, questioned school officials about ash trays kept at building entrances, which defied the ban, she was told, \\"As it relates to this ordinance, Grand Valley State University is subject to its own jurisdiction pursuant to the Michigan Constitution. In other words, we are responsible for making our own smoking policies.\\" Hamilton wrote additional stories and follow-up that led to statewide publicity on the matter and Grand Valley State University eventually created a forum to implement new smoking policies.GVSU says it doesn't have to follow county smoking ban.GVSU holds forums on smoking policies.

The largest species in the guenon family, it is one of the most widespread arboreal African primates. Aside from size, it can be differentiated from other cercopithecus monkeys by its orange diadem and white beard. Due to its cryptic nature, the species is not well documented in all of its habitats but has shown unique traits such as pair-bonding and aggressive behavior towards other guenons.  Etymology  Locally known as swamp monkeys, these primates are named after the Italian- French explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. Their scientific species name, neglectus, which means to pay no attention to, was given to them because of their ability to hide from both humans and predators.  Description  290x290px The De Brazza's monkey is the most sexually dimorphic species of guenon; males weigh around 7 kilograms, while females weigh around 4 kilograms. Adults have grey agouti fur with a reddish-brown back, black limbs and tail, and a white rump. Both sexes have cheek pouches they use to carry food while they forage. Males have a distinct blue scrotum, while females have a red perianal region and visible nipples. Juveniles lack the darker colors on the extremities that is characteristic of adults, but retain the whites stripes and red rump while infants are a uniform brown agouti with only a small beard. The white muzzle and beard, along with an orange crescent on its forehead and white stripes on its thighs distinguish it from other guenons.  Ecology = Distribution and habitat  De Brazza's monkeys range across the swamps, bamboo and dry mountain forests of Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, South Sudan, Nigeria and Uganda and possibly Tanzania though reports have not been confirmed. Troops are found almost exclusively near water, rarely venturing farther than 1 km away from a river or tributary. As a result they can sometimes be seen swimming. The monkeys prefer dense forest and vegetation, only venturing into more open forest to feed. They are mainly arboreal, but descends to the ground to feed on herbaceous plants. Due to its cryptic nature there is no accurate population estimate for the species over its entire range.  Diet  The diet of De Brazza's monkeys consists mostly of herbaceous plants found on the forest floor, and fruits when available. These are supplemented with insects, seeds, and other food sources when primary foods are scarce.  Predators  Predators of the De Brazza's monkey include the crowned eagle, leopard, humans, and common chimpanzees. Though rare, dogs and pythons may also predate on juvenile De Brazza's. The typical predator response is to curl up in a tight ball against the side of a tree with the orange crown and white stripes on the thighs hidden and wait silently for the predator to leave. Individuals will only move if the predator approaches their position, and even then they move quietly and slowly to try and escape notice.  Behavior  Mother with young The lifespan of the De Brazza's monkey is thought to correspond similarly to other members of Cercopithecus which live up to 22 years in the wild and 30 years in captivity. Its cryptic nature makes the De Brazza's monkey hard to observe in the wild. Troop sizes are small for a guenon, ranging from 2-10 individuals on average. In some areas of Western Africa, such as Gabon and Cameroon, small pair-bonded groups of a male, female, and infants and juveniles have been observed. In Eastern Africa, the DeBrazza's monkeys live in single male, multi-female groups. Solitary males do not create bachelor groups and will occasionally depose an alpha male to take over access to the females. Male De Brazza's monkey communicates with booming sounds. These are usually heard early in the morning when the male calls out to establish his territory, though he will also use this call to bring the group back together if they get separated. When attacked by predators, males will give an alarm call. In the case of crowned eagles, males will emit a short bark before attacking the eagle to scare it off. Females have also been observed to give alarms calls and growl at humans. Otherwise, female vocalizations are limited to quiet croaks given when feeding or resting. Infants and juveniles will give shrill squeals of distress when separated from their mothers or the group. Given the cryptic nature of this species, hearing their calls is sometimes the only way to know they are present. Unlike other guenons, which often form polyspecific associations to decrease predation and increase foraging, DeBrazza's monkeys will be aggressive towards other species and have only been known to tolerate some colobine species which do not compete with them for resources.  Reproduction  Female De Brazza's monkeys reach sexual maturity around 5 years of age, while males do not reach maturity until closer to 6 years of age. Most juveniles males will leave their natal group before they reach maturity. The breeding season lasts from February to March, but females can also go into estrous during times of high food availability. Gestation lasts between 5 to 6 months, and an infant stays close to its mother for the first year of its life at which point it is weaned. Females usually have one infant at a time, though twins have been born on rare occasions, with a year long inter-birth interval.  Conservation  The De Brazza's monkey is listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List. The main threats to DeBrazza's monkeys are deforestation due to logging and agriculture, and bushmeat hunting. There are several captive population housed in zoos across Europe and North America. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) manages captive population under a species survival plan. This is unique because the species is not listed as vulnerable or endangered, but has been sponsored by the AZA to proactively prevent need for reactive conservation in the future. More data is needed to fully assess the conservation needs of this species.

It is 8.3 kilometres long and extended the previously existing Gungahlin Drive from the Barton Highway in the district of Gungahlin to the Glenloch Interchange to connect with the Tuggeranong Parkway, Parkes Way, and William Hovell Drive. Early in the planning stages, the GDE was to instead be designated the John Dedman Parkway.Gungahlin Drive Extension Stage 2 - Home, ACT Government, 23 March 2012; as archived on 3 December 2012Gungahlin Drive Extension Assessment - Information Kit, Section 2, ACT Government, December 2002 Route description The GDE consists of two roads: the section of Gungahlin Drive located between Barton Highway and Belconnen Way, and Caswell Drive, located between Belconnen Way and the Glenloch Interchange. Caswell Drive was pre- existing but duplicated and upgraded as part of the works.Gungahlin Drive Extension Western Alignment - Environmental Health Assessment, Page 3, ACT Government, 17 June 2002 The extension was originally opened with a speed limit of , but after review was increased to Gungahlin Drive Extension Speed Limit Review, ACT Government, 22 March 2013 History Construction of the GDE at Belconnen Way and Caswell Dr The Gungahlin Drive Extension project had its genesis in planning that emphasised the motor car as the primary means of travel in Canberra. This philosophy is shown in planning studies dating from the 1960s. In 1991, the ACT Liberal Government began consultations for a John Dedman Parkway project, which would have gone from the Barton Highway to Belconnen Way. This project was subsequently renamed the Gungahlin Drive Extension, with the road proceeding to the Glenloch Interchange. This Gungahlin Drive Extension route and the Majura Road upgrading (between the Monaro Highway and Federal Highway), are two transport routes that are on the drawing board as north-south routes. Some consider the GDE route as a crucial link in Canberra's transport network while others consider it a white elephant and support other transport alternatives, such as light rail between Gungahlin and Civic. The ACT Labor Government won election in 2001 promising a GDE alignment that would travel west of the Australian Institute of Sport AIS. However, the Commonwealth Government's National Capital Authority decided in December 2002 to support an alignment east of the AIS as the preferred route. On 16 January 2003 the ACT Government fell in with the NCA and decided to investigate options for an Eastern Alignment for GDE in the vicinity of the AIS, as well as reviewing options for the alignment in the Aranda Precinct. Supporters of natural parkland campaigned to have the road building stopped - staging a number of demonstrations. However the ACT Government determined that the road be built, and subsequently changed the law to prevent further opposition from community groups. When the GDE was completed it was controversial as the road was originally built to a 2-lane standard rather than four; leaving southbound and northbound commuters with lengthy delays each morning and afternoon. Work commenced in October 2009 to widen the 2 lane sections to 4 lanes as originally planned. The area near the south bound lanes leading into the Glenloch interchange was the first area to be widened as this area bears the heaviest traffic load during peak times. The road has now been completed to a 4 lane freeway standard.  Protests  When the Gungahlin Drive Extension plans were made public, there were protests by various groups in order to stop or delay work on the road. The main protests came from a group called \\"Save The Ridge\\". This group were angry about the destruction of the flora and fauna that would occur with the GDE running through the Bruce / O'Connor Ridge. Meanwhile, another group called GDE Now! was formed, with a slogan 'Pave the Ridge'. In 2004 Save The Ridge had a legal victory with the ACT Government in relation to local planning laws. The ACT Government then passed a new law with the purpose of overriding further legal challenges at the local level. In 2005 Save The Ridge took the ACT Government and the National Capital Authority to the Federal Court of Australia in a further effort to have the project shut down. In September 2005 the Federal Court ruled in favour of the NCA and the ACT Government, giving the go-ahead for the project to resume. On 10 December 2006, during Stage 1 of the GDE opening, Save The Ridge again protested against the road, and called for an immediate halt to the rest of the construction taking place. They called the GDE \\"one of the most expensive non tunnelled single lane roads per kilometre in Australia's history.\\" Bridge collapse GDE Bridge after the collapse On 14 August 2010, the eastern duplication bridge of the GDE, over the Barton Highway, partially collapsed. The new bridge was under construction when it collapsed. ACT Police, ACT Ambulance Service and the ACT Fire Brigade attended the scene and freed one man who was trapped under the rubble. At least 9 people were taken to the Canberra Hospital for treatment and another 5 were injured however there were no critical injuries, all those affected were working on a new span of the bridge. The Barton Highway and northern GDE were closed for several hours as investigations commenced.Bridge Collapse, Canberra Times Online 14 Aug 10Nine injured in Canberra bridge collapse 14 August 2010 The Barton Highway was reopened on 9 September 2010 after investigations and removal of the collapsed bridge.http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/10/3007818.htm Construction on the second span started afresh at the end of December 2010 with all contractors taking on board the recommendations made by ACT Workcover relating to worker safety and materials to ensure that the collapse of the old span is not repeated. Interchanges The GDE has multiple interchanges along its length providing access to suburbs and facilities in the Gungahlin and Belconnen districts as well as the Inner North, there are links to several arterial roads.Google Maps - Gungahlin Dr, Google, accessed 18 April 2013ACTMAPi , ACT Government, accessed 18 April 2013 See also * Freeways in Australia * Freeways in Canberra References External links  * Video of the extension (Barton Hwy to Belconnen Way) * Save The Ridge * Work on GDE can restart:ruling * Category:Streets in Canberra Category:Two-lane freeways ","title":"Gungahlin Drive Extension"},{"id":"4417932","text":"Black Lotus Records was an independent record label based in Greece that specialized in metal.

Liacouras, 1931–2016 was an American academic.The man behind the university’s image Career Liacouras was the President of Temple University from 1981–2000, and former Dean of the Temple University School of Law (1972–1982). He was chancellor of Temple since his retirement in 2000. During his presidency, the University developed into a Carnegie I classification institution, expansion of academic programs globally, growth in undergraduate enrollment and considerable infrastructure development.Major Changes during the Liacouras Years Liacouras' tenure was marked by substantial focus on urban economic and social development. Seeking to capitalize on the University's location in north central Philadelphia, Liacouras sought to market a vision of Temple as the quintessential working class university that would also increasingly appeal to working class suburbanites from the metropolitan Philadelphia area and South Jersey. He employed creative marketing strategies—notably, a marketing campaign with a tagline of \\"we could have gone anywhere—we chose Temple\\", and featuring alumnus and Philadelphia native Bill Cosby (later elected to the Temple Board of Trustees). Temple Town Liacouras also sought to impart an urban planning vision for Temple University in a concept he called \\"Temple Town\\". He invested considerable effort into redeveloping the University's main campus, with the development of on-campus housing at both sides of the campus, planning for new classroom and laboratory facilities to replace antiquated facilities, and the construction of an arena on campus on adjacent land sold to the University by the car dealership that previously occupied the space. The arena, originally named \\"The Apollo of Temple\\" (a pun on the Temple of Apollo, as well as a reference to the Apollo Theater in Harlem), was later renamed the Liacouras Center in his honor. The arena houses the intercollegiate basketball teams of the University and other athletics facilities, but a main focal point for its development was the desire of Liacouras to have academic convocations on-campus. The planning vision to inculcate local businesses along a stretch of the inner main campus was not successfully achieved until after his tenure. His planning vision failed to convince local planning leaders to move the local regional rail station on the far eastern side of the campus in closer to the campus (away from the low- income housing that one walks by on the way to the campus). The \\"Temple Town\\" concept was sometimes criticized as an effort to insulate the University's main campus from the surrounding north central Philadelphia neighborhood, and his efforts to promote an esprit de corps, having painted messages on wood structures covering decrepit infrastructure adjacent to the University's Broad Street gateway were sometimes ridiculed. His planning vision extended to the development of academic programs globally, with programs now located in London, Rome, Tel Aviv, Ghana, Seoul, and Beijing. Liacouras' planning also led to the development of a new Temple University Hospital facility on the University's Hospital campus (serving Allied Health Professions, Medicine, Podiatric Medicine, and Dentistry programs), and expansion of the Hospital as a business with satellite locations around the metropolitan Philadelphia area.  Labor relations  Liacouras' tenure was marked by contentious relationships with the University's dozen labor unions. In an unprecedented move, the faculty union struck twice in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, with an AAUP censure placed against the institution. Other labor unions representing various levels of staff also engaged in strike actions during his tenure.  Intercollegiate athletics  Liacouras was notable for his strong support of football and basketball. Other sports, like swimming, he dropped. He saw this as part of his strongly held beliefs in urban social and economic development, and a vehicle for successful marketing of the University. His hiring of John Chaney as head basketball coach—an outspoken critic of the NCAA and advocate for access to higher education—led to many NCAA Tournament appearances for the Temple men's basketball team, including several appearances in the \\"Elite 8\\" (notably losing to the Duke Blue Devils in 1999). Liacouras was less successful in intercollegiate football. He was pilloried for making comments about wanting to see Temple's football team in the Sugar Bowl by the mid-1980s. The main success of the football team came under coach Bruce Arians, whom Liacouras hired from Bear Bryant's staff at the University of Alabama (now coach of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals), in the early to mid-1980s. Minor success was had for a year under coach Jerry Berndt (hired from the University of Pennsylvania). After the 1990s, the football team was considered non-competitive, and eventually the University was kicked out of the Big East football conference. Critics assailed Liacouras' for his support of football as embarrassing to the University (for the lack of consistent success on the field, even if some players wound up as successful NFL players) and a drain on University resources that could be invested into academic facilities.  Political activity  Liacouras was active in local Philadelphia politics, typically supportive of local Democratic Party leaders. His administration frequently included people in executive and staff positions that drew from local and state political circles. However, he did not enjoy a good relationship with the district city councilman that represented the Temple main campus area, John F. Street (later elected Mayor of Philadelphia), and Street held up development of the arena until concessions were made for local business incubation. Liacouras unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for the US Senate in 1980. He was succeeded in 2000 by David Adamany, the former President of Wayne State University. Liacouras is a member of the Academy of Athens.
