The house was originally built for the industrialist and art collector Charles Lang Freer, whose gift of the Freer Gallery of Art began the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. The structure currently hosts the Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute of Child & Family Development of Wayne State University. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1970 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History Charles Lang Freer, in partnership with Col. Frank J. Hecker, made his fortune from the Peninsular Car Company.Charles Lang Freer Home from Detroit1701.org Freer travelled widely, with one of his favorite spots being Newport, Rhode Island. There, he was favorably impressed by the shingle style summer cottages built by the wealthy. Desiring a similar home, in 1890 Freer contracted with Wilson Eyre to design a home in Detroit. The house, on Ferry Street next door to Hecker's home, was completed in 1892. Architecture For the exterior, Eyre used coursed hard blue limestone (now discolored) from New York for the first floor. Dark, closely spaced shingles of Michigan oak cover most of the rest of the fa√ßade. On the third story, a triangular gable and various dormers interrupt the roofline. Chimneys dominate the east and west ends of the home, underneath which are porches. These porches were originally open-air, but are currently closed stucco. The structure on the right is the carriage house of the Freer House, where The Peacock Room was installed. The structure on the left is the carriage house of the next-door Hecker house. On the interior, Eyre designed the home with Freer's art collection in mind. (This collection is now in the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art.) There are 22 rooms and 12 fireplaces in the house, as well as an elevator, and numerous balconies, bay windows, enclosed porches, and skylights.Charles Lang Freer House from the city of Detroit In 1906, Eyre designed an art gallery, added above the stable. In 1904, Frederick Leyland's widow sold Freer The Peacock Room, designed by James Whistler, and Freer had Eyre design another room in the carriage houseFreer House history from the Merrill Palmer Institute in which to install it.

It is for recreational use such as a picnic spot or a trail head. A roadside park will generally be found in a rural setting, whereas a rest area will be found on an interstate highway in a suburban setting or between major destinations like cities. A rest area is specifically designed for the rest and relaxation of the motoring public. The roadside park with the use of picnic tables is the predecessor of the modern rest area / travel plaza. Different states would have formal and informal designations for these spots, including \\"roadside table,\\" \\"wayside table,\\" \\"wayside park,\\" or \\"wayside picnic area.\\" Many roadside parks have restroom facilities or at least pit toilets, where some small roadside parks have no restroom facilities at all. Some have water and many are designated on state maps with a small picnic table. Some continents have roadside parks, however they are not a worldwide phenomenon. They are popular in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, however basically not known in Mexico, Central America, South America, Africa, nor the Far East Asian countries. History Contains water, pit toilets, state map Roadside park sign to alert travelers A roadside park in Florida Herbert F. Larson started the idea of the roadside park. History records that the idea goes back to 1918 in the early days of auto touring. Larson was then a history-minded highway engineer just out of the University of Michigan School of Engineering. He came back to Iron County where he grew up to manage the highway department. Most of the big pines in Iron County were being cut down by the lumber companies at this time. Larson seeing this hoped someday to keep scenic wide strips of old growth trees along Iron County's principal roads. He envisioned the possibility of a In his words he The inspiration of the roadside park idea came from a disappointed Sunday outing of a nearby Wisconsin lake country picnic. In 1919 northern Wisconsin lake resorts were growing rapidly. On a particular Sunday of that year, Larson tried to have a cookout with a group of people in Wisconsin. Everywhere they went the property caretaker asked them to not have their picnic on the property and escourted them off the grounds. Larson wrote, He did not want the nearby Upper Peninsula of Michigan to suffer a similar loss of the much-loved pastime of picnicking. This is where he was inspired with the idea of a wide right of way road spot as a roadside park. One day Larson learned that a particular prominently located parcel of land of uncut virgin woods east of Iron River, Michigan, on U.S. 2 might be up for sale. He went to the landowners with the support of the Iron County board chairman. They then negotiated with the owners and bought it as a forest memorial public woods. This is where he placed his first picnic table for a designated rest spot for the motoring public.First Roadside Park Historical Marker - Iron CountyMichigan Department of Transportation There is a possibility this was even the first designated automobile rest area anywhere in the world.Iron County time lineAmerican Highways By American Association of State Highway Officials, page 16, Published 1973, Original at University of Michigan It is located at coordinates N 46.1067 W -88.54.78USGS Feature ID: 2129533 First Roadside Park Historical Marker in a stand of old-growth hardwood trees.

They operated primarily between 1961 and 1964. Foundation The roots of the MLN lay in the Committee to Promote Peace (CIP), founded in July 1959 by L√°zaro C√°rdenas. From the CIP came the Provisional Committee for National Sovereignty and Economic Emancipation (CLSNEEP), whose goal was to organize a local chapter within Mexico. On August 5, 1961, the committee announced the formation of the National Liberation Movement. The MLN stated as its priorities; regime change, release of political prisoners, solidarity with Cuba, municipal autonomy for unions and peasant organizations, opposition presence in Congress, weakened presidentialism, and undermined corporatist control. The founding organizations of the MLN was a composition of leftist Marxist parties, the National Peasant Confederation (CNC), the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), members of the official Institutional Revolutionary Party () (PRI) party, and the Popular Socialist Party () (PPS). Decline The Popular Socialist Party withdrew in December 1962 after rumors spread the MLN was planning to organize a new peasant movement outside the PRI to push for agrarian reform. In January 1963, L√°zaro C√°rdenas announced the formation of just such a party, the Central Campesina Independiente (CCI) to attack the PRI's corruption and betrayal of peasant struggles. Following the MLN's refusal to declare itself an official party for election, it was believed the group began a rapid decline. The issue of solidarity with the Cuban Revolution became a stopping point with the government of then President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos. In addition the issue of political prisoners, the release of Valentin Campa and Demetrio Vallejo, finally led Mateos to denounce the MLN, stating they had succumbed to communist infiltration. In 1968 the leaders of the MLN were jailed during the popular student movement, signaling the death of the party. Notable members Notable members of the Movement of National Liberation included: *Carlos Salinas de Gortari - Former Mexican president, 1988-1994. *Gilberto Rinc√≥n Gallardo - Former presidential candidate, politician and activist. *Arnoldo Mart√≠nez Verdugo - Politician and former leader of the Mexican Communist Party and of the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico. *Genaro V√°zquez Rojas - Former civic association leader, militant, and guerrilla fighter.

Loudness compensation is a setting found on some hi-fi equipment that increases the level of the high and low frequencies. This is intended to be used at low listening levels, to compensate for the fact that as the loudness of audio decreases, the ear's lower sensitivity to extreme high and low frequencies may cause these signals to fall below threshold. As a result audio material may become thin sounding at low volumes, losing bass and treble. The loudness compensation feature (often just labelled loudness) applies equalization and is intended to rectify this situation. Correct loudness compensation required a calibrated system with known listening level. Audio level at a listener's ears depends on listening environment, listener position, speaker sensitivity as well as amplifier gain. For loudness compensation to work correctly the playback system must also accurately assume what volume level was used in the mastering location. For movie soundtracks this reference volume level is an industry standardSMPTE 202m-1998 and can be used by manufacturers to provide a loudness feature that works with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

His most important work was a commission from the Archbishop of Bar, Andrija Zmajeviƒá, done at the end of the 17th century. This was a cycle of canvases for the church of Our Lady of the Rocks, opposite Perast, based on instructions of Andrija Zmajeviƒá. The lower series of paintings depicts prophets and sibyls; above these are the Presentation of the Virgin, the Death of the Virgin, and the Descent of the Holy Ghost. Above the arch is the Coronation of the Virgin. The ceiling, too, is painted, divided into 45 sections which depict scenes from the Life of the Virgin interspersed with images of evangelists, Fathers of the Church, angels, and still lifes of baskets of flowers. These paintings combine certain hallmarks of Baroque technique with a provincial understanding of both drawing and perspective. They were badly restored by a local Franciscan painter, Josip Rossi, in 1883. Other works known to be by Kokolja include portraits of Vicko Bujoviƒá and admiral Krsto Zmajeviƒá, both of which may be seen in the town museum, along with a self-portrait. A set of wall paintings in Archbishop Zmajevic's palace, done in 1670, is ruined, but is known to have included landscapes. Kokolja moved to Korƒçula, Croatia towards the end of his life, following the death of his friend Vicko Bujoviƒá, dying there in 1713. Among his later works are paintings for the Dominican church in Bol, on the island of Braƒç.

She created 'Mrs Appleby's Cheshire' which by the time of her death was the last remaining Cheshire cheese to observe the traditions of using unpasteurised milk from the farm herd, being bound in calico cloth and matured on-farm. Lucy went on to co-found the Specialist Cheesemakers Association to defend the use of unpasteurised milk in cheesemaking.  Early life and education  One of eight children, Lucy Appleby was born Florence Lucy Walley on 1 February 1920 to a farming and cheesemaking family at Lighteach Farm, Whitchurch, Shropshire. She attended Whitchurch Girls School which was integrated into Sir John Talbot‚Äôs School in 1936. She learnt cheesemaking from her grandmother and mother and went on to study it at Cheshire School of Agriculture (now Reaseheath College ) under the direction of a Miss Bennion, Chief Dairy Instructress and proponent of traditional cheesemaking techniques.  Cheesemaking  The Applebys' cheese company was founded in 1952. The stables at Hawkstone Abbey Farm were converted into a dairy where Appleby made cloth-bound Cheshire cheese to a traditional recipe using unpasteurised milk from their herd of Friesian cattle. Appleby's ambition was to revive a cheese that had been made on 2000 farms as recently as 1914 but whose production had declined to less than 50 producers by the time Lucy started the Appleby's cheese company. In 2017, the Appleby family was the only remaining regular producer of unpasteurised milk farmhouse Cheshire. Lucy Appleby took a number of decisions as a cheesemaker that went against the emerging trends and pressures of her time but which preserved the authenticity and quality of Appleby's Cheshire. At the time that Appleby began making cheese at Hawkstone Abbey Farm cheesemakers were experimenting with binding cheeses in wax, rather than the traditional calico cloth to reduce moisture loss and thus increase yield. Appleby rejected this method because she believed that calico allowed the cheese to breathe and better flavours to develop as a result. In later years she encouraged fellow cheesemakers who had adopted wax binding to revert to calico. As was customary at the time, the Appleby's cheese was initially sold through the Milk Marketing Board (MMB). But over time the MMB became less aligned with the Applebys' relatively small scale, artisan approach and in 1982 they broke ties with the organisation. This meant their cheese could be marketed for the first time under the family name. As a result, the Applebys needed to find new markets for their cheese and so they drove, with a typical 20kg wheel of cheese, to London to introduce leading artisan cheese sellers to Mrs Appleby's Cheshire. This direct approach was a success and within five years the Appleby's were selling 1.5 tonnes a week. In the late 1980s a series of public health scares led supermarkets to stop selling cheese made from unpasteurised milk. Whilst many cheesemakers felt compelled to pasteurise their milk in order to retain the supermarkets' business, Appleby did not follow suit believing that quality unpasteurised milk was key to the flavour and texture of her cheese. Appleby subsequently co-founded, with Randolph Hodgson, the Specialist Cheesemakers Association, to lobby for the preservation of cheeses made with unpasteurised milk and to encourage excellence in farmhouse cheesemaking.  Personal life  After leaving college she met farmer Lancelot Appleby, whom she married 16 October 1940. She made the Lighteach cheese on her wedding day. They lived for two years near the village of Malpas, Cheshire, before moving to Lance's family farm, Hawkstone Abbey Farm, situated on the edge of the Cheshire Plain in North Shropshire. Over the following decade Lucy and Lance had seven children: Edward, Helen, John, Margaret, Rachel, Robert and Ruth. After raising her children she returned to cheese-making using her own recipe. Lance Appleby died in 2003 and her son, Robert, died in 2002. Lucy Appleby died on 24 April 2008.  Awards  In 2001 Lucy and Lance Appleby were both awarded MBEs for their services to cheesemaking in Shropshire.

Most of them are small or rarely seen. But there are a few which are large or prominent. The largest reptiles which can be found in Singapore are the estuarine crocodile and the reticulated python. The ones most commonly seen in urban areas are the house geckos (typically called house lizard by the lay-person) and the non-native changeable lizard. The changeable lizard has pushed the local green crested lizard into forested areas. In gardens and parks, one can often see common sun skinks, the introduced red- eared sliders and flying lizards. Water monitors are common in rivers and mangrove. Another monitor that can be found in Singapore is the clouded monitor, which is a forest species. It is smaller than the Malayan water monitor, has slit nostrils and is paler in colour. In 2008, the Dumeril's monitor was rediscovered in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. This goes to show that there can still be surprises in the forests of Singapore. Equatorial spitting cobras can still be found in desolated urban areas of Singapore. The bigger king cobra is much rarer. The banded krait sometimes show up as road kills. There are also 2 coral snake and 9 sea snake species.

She rose up the ranks of the Zengakuren to become one of its top leaders. =JRA movement= In February 1971, she and Tsuyoshi Okudaira went to the Middle East to create international branches of the Japanese Red Army. Upon arrival, she soon split with the Red Army Faction in Japan due to both geographical and ideological distance, as well as a personal conflict with the new leader, Tsuneo Mori.https://unseenjapan.com/united-red-army-japan/ The Red Army went on to link up with the Maoist Revolutionary Left Wing of the Japanese Communist Party to form the United Red Army. Upon hearing about the internal purge the United Red Army carried out in the winter of 1971‚Äì1972, Shigenobu recalls her shock and sorrow.

Her destination was Lebanon, and her aim was to support the Palestinian cause. She originally joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) as a volunteer, but eventually the JRA became an independent group.Shigenobu. \\"A Personal History of the Japanese Red Army\\". She mentions in several of her books \\"The mission's purpose was to consolidate the international revolutionary alliance against the imperialists of the world.\\"Fusako Shigenobu Biography, enotes.com Shigenobu was listed as a wanted person by the INTERPOL in 1974 after the French embassy hostage-taking in the Hague in which she was believed to be involved. Process to arrest Shigenobu continued to escape although she was internationally arranged for her involvement in the 1974 French Embassy attack in The Hague. According to the materials seized by Shigenobu when she was arrested and the newspapers that reported it, she illegally entered Japan using a forged passport that she illegally obtained by impersonating herself as another person. She repeatedly entered and left People's Republic of China 16 times from Kansai International Airport since December 1997 to September 2000. Since 1991, she established the \\"People's Revolutionary Party\\" for the purpose of \\"Armed revolution\\" in Japan and the masked organization \\"The 21st Century of Hope\\" in charge of its public activity department. It is also said that she used it as a foothold to plan cooperation with the Japanese Socialist Party. After that, she was hiding in an apartment in Nishinari Ward, Osaka for a while. In 2000, Osaka Prefecture Security Guard Public Safety Section 3 was inspecting the supporters of the Japanese Red Army and began to investigate the person who was in contact with a woman similar to Shigenobu. Shigenobu was characterized by nevus, but she had hidden her nevus on her face with makeup. However, her fingerprints were collected from the coffee cup used by the woman similar to Shigenobu. Her way of smoking was similar to Shigenobu and she drank at a certain place. The third security department found that it matched Shigenobu's fingerprint. 26 years after the 1974 French Embassy attack in The Hague, Shigenobu was arrested on November 8 in Takatsuki City, Osaka, where she was hiding. In addition, the Tokaido Shinkansen was used for her transfer from Osaka to the Metropolitan Police Department in Tokyo, and a private room of the ‚Äúgreen car‚Äú was used to prevent escape. She was taken in for questioning from a hotel in Takatsuki, near Osaka, in November of that year.Fighel, Jonathan (Col. Ret.) (November 9, 2000) Japanese Red Army Founder Arrested in Japan, International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, Retrieved January 16, 2016 Japanese citizens were startled to see a handcuffed middle-aged woman emerge from a train arriving in Tokyo. When Shigenobu spotted the waiting cameras, she raised her hands and gave the thumbs-up, shouting at reporters: \\"I'll fight on!\\" She was sentenced to 20 years in prison on 8 March 2006,Japanese Red Army Leader Gets 20 Years in Prison , Palestine Press, February 23, 2007http://www.moj.go.jp/psia/ITH/organizations/ES_E-asia_oce/nihon-seki- gun.html and received a final verdict from the Japanese Supreme Court in 2010 with the same terms. The prosecution charged her on three counts, the use of forged passport, aiding another member in the JRA in obtaining a forged passport, and attempted manslaughter by planning and commanding the 1974 occupation and hostage taking at the French embassy in The Hague, the Netherlands. Shigenobu pleaded guilty to the first two charges, but not guilty to the charge linking her to the 1974 embassy hostage taking. Among the witnesses that appeared in her court for the defense was Leila Khaled, known for the 1969 hijacking of TWA Flight 840, and currently a member of the Palestinian National Council. In his final verdict, the judge stated that there was no conclusive evidence of her involvement in the armed occupation of the embassy that resulted in the injury of two policemen, or in the intention of attempted manslaughter, but sentenced her for possibly conspiring with members of her group to occupy the embassy.  Hague Trial  = Prosecution = Shigenobu was arrested for involvement in French embassy hostage-taking that took place in The Hague,Netherlands, in order to recapture (Yoshiaki Yamada) of the Japanese Red Army arrested by the French authorities on September 13, 1974. Shigenobu was prosecuted for conspiracy joint conviction for illegal arrest and imprisonment, and attempted murder. Prosecutors said the Japanese Red Army issued a crime statement the day after the execution and requested Palestinian Liberation People's Front (PFLP) from other Japanese Red Army publications to coordinate with the country that accepts arms procurement and released fellows. Based on evidence from former members who said that Shigenobu remarked for lack of preparation at the meeting after the incident, accused him of leading the crime as a mastermind in the French embassy hostage-taking and sentenced her to life imprisonment. In response to this, the defense side said, \\"At the time of the French embassy hostage-taking, the Japanese Red Army did not have an organizational structure and was not in a position to be instructed by Shigenobu because it was a PFLP operation and she was in Libya and has an alibi‚Äú. The Tokyo District Court found on February 23, 2006, \\"Defense Shigenobu played an important role in asking PFLP to coordinate arms procurement and countries accepting freed fellows.\\" \\"The details, time, and place of the conspiracy are not clear, but the defendant is conspiring with the criminal through a cooperating organization in the Arab countries, and it cannot be established as an alibi.\\" The sentence was \\"Selfish offense that absolutely regards one's principles and claims and does not care about the dangers to many lives and bodies, and no serious remorse is seen\\". But on the other hand, \\"Haruo Wako, the executing offender has decided on the important matters of the crime, and it cannot be asserted that the defendant had a core position but took the lead in the crime‚Äú. Then rejected the life imprisonment sentenced by the prosecution and sentenced to 20 years in prison. = Imprisonment = On the other hand, Shigenobu's daughter Mei Shigenobu and chief attorney Kyoko Otani filed an appeal on the same day. In the appeals court, both the defense and the prosecution received terrorist \\"Carlos\\" prison sentences in France in the 1970s and 1980s, as in Shigenobu, causing terrorist attacks in many countries around the world, slaughtering a large number of civilians. Obtained a testimony about the command system of the French embassy hostage-taking and the history of the provision of arms, and submitted it to the court. On December 20, 2007, the Tokyo High Court upheld the first- instance decision and dismissed the appeal . Shigenobu filed an appeal, but on July 15, 2010, the decision was made to reject it and the sentence was confirmed. Shigenobu filed an objection to the decision to reject the appeal, but on August 4, 2010, the Supreme Court No. 2 Small Court (Yukio Takeuchi, Chief Justice) decided to reject the decision, and the first and second trial sentences with 20 years in prison were finalized. Shigenobu later served. However, due to the inclusion of three years of detention for 810 days into prison, it was actually 17 years and Shigenobu's planned source was 2027.

At a press conference before the sentence in February 2006, her lawyers read a haiku she had composed: \\"[t]he verdict is not the end. It is only the beginning.

The film is alleged to be about Carmen Snedeker and her family, though Ray Garton, author of In a Dark Place: The Story of a True Haunting (1992), has publicly distanced himself from the accuracy of the events he depicted in the book. The film's story follows the fictional Campbells as they move into a house (a former mortuary) to mitigate the strains of travel on their cancer-stricken son, Matt. The family soon becomes haunted by violent and traumatic events from supernatural forces occupying the house. Although the film was moderately successful at the box office, grossing $77,527,732, it received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to Metacritic. In 2010 Gold Circle Films announced the production of two more entries in the franchise, The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia (released 2013) and The Amityville Murders: A Haunting on Long Island. They noted, however, that neither film would be a direct sequel to The Haunting in Connecticut and would instead be self- contained films with unique characters. Plot In 1987, Sara Campbell (Virginia Madsen) is driving her son Matt (Kyle Gallner) home from the hospital where he has been undergoing cancer treatments. Sara and her husband Peter (Martin Donovan), a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sara finds a man putting up a ‚ÄúFor Rent‚Äù sign in front of a large house. The man is frustrated and offers her the first month free if she will rent it immediately. The following day, Peter arrives with Matt's brother Billy (Ty Wood) and cousins Wendy (Amanda Crew) and Mary, and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, where there is a mysterious door. After moving in, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. The next day, Peter learns that the house was supposedly a funeral home; the room behind the mysterious door is a mortuary. Matt tells another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu (Elias Koteas), about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room who begins to move toward him. When the family comes home, they find a shirtless Matt with his fingers blood-covered from scratching at the wall. The family begins to crack under the stress of Matt's illness and bizarre behavior. The children find a box of photographs, which show Jonah, a young man from Matt's visions, at a s√©ance, emitting ectoplasm from his mouth. Wendy and Matt find out that the funeral home was run by a man named Ramsey Aickman. Aickman also conducted psychic research and would host s√©ances with Jonah as the medium. At one s√©ance, all those attending, including Aickman, were found dead and Jonah disappeared. Nicholas theorizes that Aickman was practicing necromancy in an attempt to control the dead and bind them to the house. That night, Nicholas finds human remains in the house and removes them. Matt awakens to find Aickman‚Äôs symbols carved into his skin. He is taken to the hospital, where he encounters Jonah. Nicholas and Matt begin to have simultaneous visions. Everyone in the s√©ance is burnt, after a flash of bright light. The barely alive Aickman told Jonah to get out of the house, concerned that the demonic presence will get him next. Jonah uses a dumbwaiter to escape, calling for help. Entering an unknown chamber, Jonah realizes that he has entered the crematory. The spirit traps Jonah in the crematory, and cremates him alive. Peter and Sara learn that Matt's cancer treatments have had no effect. They then discover that Matt has escaped the hospital. Back at the house, Nicholas leaves a message telling the family to get out of the house immediately ‚Äì Jonah's spirit was actually protecting them from the spirits. Matt breaks through the walls in the front room with an axe, revealing the dusty corpses Aickman hid in the walls. He forces Wendy and the children to get out, barricading himself inside and tearing down the other walls, as corpses begin to tumble into the room. The view switches from Matt to Jonah, who seems to be occupying Matt's body. Matt lights the bodies and the room on fire. Later on investigators arrive to the house to only find it engulfed in flames. As the fire department arrives, Sara and Peter frantically try to get in to save Matt. The spirits, finally freed, disappear. Outside, everyone watches tearfully as the emergency crew attempts to resuscitate a dying Matt. As Matt slips away, he has a vision of himself standing in the graveyard where he sees Jonah, no longer appearing burnt. He seems about to follow Jonah when he hears his mother‚Äôs voice. He returns to his body and Jonah's spirit leaves him. Matt's cancer disappears, and the house was rebuilt and resold with no further reported incidents of haunting. Cast \\"Based on a true story\\" controversy Promotional material for the film claimed that it was \\"based on true events\\" experienced by the Snedeker family of Southington, Connecticut in 1986. Ed and Lorraine Warren claimed that the Snedeker house was a former funeral home where morticians regularly practiced necromancy, and that there were \\"powerful\\" supernatural \\"forces at work\\" that were cured by an exorcism. Carmen Snedeker's claims of haunting by an \\"evil entity\\" and subsequent exorcism were dramatized in episodes of the television series A Haunting, Paranormal Witness and Mysteries at the Museum. However, according to skeptical investigator Benjamin Radford, there is \\"little or no proof that anything supernatural occurred at the house\\". Radford wrote that author Ray Garton was employed by the Warrens to write the supposedly \\"true story\\" and was instructed by Ed Warren, \\"You've got some of the story ‚Äî just use what works and make the rest up‚Ä¶ Just make it up and make it scary.\\" Researcher Joe Nickell has dismissed the story as a hoax. Nickell noted that since Ed Warren died in 2006, some of his coauthors have admitted he \\"told them to make up incidents and details to create scary stories.\\"Nickell, Joe.

Production Filming began on September 10, 2007 in Teulon and Winnipeg, Canada, and finished on 16 December 2007; it took roughly around three months to complete the filming. The film was released on March 27, 2009 in the UK, USA, and Canada. The film was later released over the course of nine months to other countries, and was shown at the Imagine: Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival the April following domestic release. Home release The Haunting in Connecticut debuted in the number one position on the DVD and Blu-ray charts with 1.5 million units sold. Rentrak reported that the DVD release of The Haunting in Connecticut was No. 1 in DVD sales for the week ending July 19, 2009.

The DVD material was produced and directed by Daniel Farrands, who also served as a producer on the film. \\"Anatomy of a Haunting\\" featured commentary by parapsychological researchers Dr. Barry E. Taff and Jack Rourke. The DVD release of The Haunting in Connecticut was the recipient of the Best Ghost Story award in Home Media Magazine's 2009 Reaper Awards ceremony held in Los Angeles in October 2009. Release =Critical reception= Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes rated the film as \\"rotten\\", with a 17% approval rating based on 105 reviews and an average rating of 4.29/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Though it features a few scares and some creepy atmosphere, The Haunting in Connecticut ultimately relies too much on familiar horror cliches to achieve its goals.\\" Metacritic found the film had received \\"Generally unfavourable reviews\\", scoring 33 out of 100 based on 23 critic reviews. While the film was mainly criticized for its use of horror cliches and \\"jump\\" scare tactics, certain aspects of the film were praised by many critics. Particular credit went to the acting: primarily the performances of Gallner and Madsen. Film critic Roger Ebert said the film \\"is a technically proficient horror movie and well acted,\\" though he gave the movie only two stars. =Box office= In North America, the film opened in second place (behind Monsters vs Aliens), averaging $8,420 at 2,732 theatres.

It was created by Larry Schwarz, who also created similar series, Kappa Mikey and Speed Racer: The Next Generation. It is a collaboration between Animation Collective in Manhattan, New York and the now-defunct Fatkat in Miramichi, New Brunswick as their last project. The show premiered on Nicktoons in the United States, and YTV in Canada on June 27, 2008. An episode of Three Delivery was first shown at the New York Comic Con 2008, on April 19, 2008. The show was broadcast CBBC in the UK having begun on February 21, 2009 and on Once TV in Mexico. Official show description Characters *Sue Yee (Stephanie Sheh): a tough girl dedicated to her friends and family. Despite some sibling rivalry, she and her older brother Sid will do anything to protect each other. Sue won't admit it, but she has a crush on Barney. * Tobey Li (Robby Duncan Sharpe): a boy with a big heart and stomach and a bigger sense of humour, in spite of his dark past. Despite his constant joking around, he loves being a superhero and will protect his friends no matter what. * Sid Yee (Johnny Yong Bosch): a cool and composed boy with a razor sharp wit and an interest in music. He is Sue's older brother and takes his duties as one of Chinatown's protectors seriously. * Nana (Nancy Wu): a kind but tough old lady who is the guardian of the magic cookbook and the most formidable defence against Kong Li; she's an expert in both magic and martial arts. She takes in Sue, Sid, and Tobey and trains them to defend Chinatown against Kong Li. Her real name is Mei Wa and she's Mr. Wu's mother, and Barney's grandmother. * Mr. Calvin Wu (Michael Alston Baley): the proud and boastful owner of Wu's Garden Restaurant, where Sue, Sid, and Tobey are employed as delivery people. While he yells at his employees often for slacking off and subjects them to trying his new and unusual recipes, Mr. Wu actually has a good heart. * Barney Wu (David Chen): Calvin's son who has his head in the clouds and his hands in a dirty sink so often that he doesn't notice Tobey, Sid, and Sue have been protecting Chinatown. Like his father, he has strange ideas, but a good heart. * Kong Li (Lex Woutas): a former martial arts student who became a cruel and ambitious magician who will stop at nothing to obtain the magic cookbook. For now, he remains trapped within the barrier around Chinatown. * Eugene (Jamie McGonnigal): Sue, Sid and Tobey's science nerd classmate and friend. Production Animation Collective partnered with FatKat to guarantee more fluid, traditional-style 2D animation not usually found in Flash shows. The backgrounds are also painted in Flash. Schwarz was drawn to the premise, saying that he used to live near Manhattan's Chinatown himself and that this show would reflect some of his personal experiences.Toonzone.net Release on Three Delivery panel at NYCC 2008 !!!!

He declined to take a position offered to him in the United States after the war, and he continued his teaching and research at Erlangen. Education From 1929 to 1933, Volz studied at the Eberhard-Karls-Universit√§t T√ºbingen and the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen. He received his doctorate in 1935 under Hans Geiger at the University of T√ºbingen. Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Volz.

From 1937 to 1944, Volz was a teaching assistant to Hans Geiger at the Technische Hochschule Berlin (today, the Technische Universit√§t Berlin, in Berlin-Charlottenburg. During this period, Volz worked on the German nuclear energy project, also called the Uranverein (Uranium Club). He specialized in experimental studies of neutron absorption in uranium, conducted with another former student of Geiger, Otto Haxel. From 1943 to 1944, he was also a lecturer at the Technische Hochschule Berlin. Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Volz. From 1944, Volz was an extraordinarius professor (professor without a chair) at the Friedrich- Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg. Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Volz. Near the close and after the end of World War II in Europe, the Russians and the Western powers had programs to foster technology transfer and exploit German technical specialists. For example, the U.S. had Operation Paperclip Naimark, 1995, 205-207. The author also points out that denying scientific and technical personnel to the Soviets was as much an objective as was acquiring their services for the West. Gimbel, 1986, 433-451. The author, in Reference #3 on page 434, points out that the Soviets protested to President Truman about U.S. and British removal in June 1945 of equipment, documents, and personnel from regions which were to fall within the Soviet zone of occupation. General Eisenhower investigated and reported that the Soviet‚Äôs were correct about the removals, but what had been done had exceeded their claims. Gimbel, 1990. and the Russians had trophy brigades advancing with their military forces. In the area of atomic technology, the U.S. had Operation Alsos and the Russians had their version. While operational aspects of the Russian operation were modelled after the trophy brigades, a more refined approach was warranted for the exploitation of German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, and scientific personnel. This was rectified with a decree in late 1944 and the formation of specialised exploitation teams in early 1945 under the Russian Alsos, which had broader objectives, including wholesale relocation of scientific facilities to the Soviet Union. Oleynikov, 2000, 3. Volz was offered a position in the United States through Operation Paperclip. Volz had received a letter from the Munich Branch of the American War Department indicating that he had been suggested for a position in the United States and that he should henceforth report any change of address to the United States occupation authorities. The letter was not clear if this offer was voluntary or compulsory. Under further investigation, Volz found that the offer had a number of stipulations. On the positive side, his family in Germany would receive better quality care and rations than the average citizen of Germany under the occupation. On the other hand, he would not be allowed to correspond with anyone other than his relatives, he was to obey all orders, he would be restricted to a 50-mile radius around his duty station, and the minimum obligation had to be for at least six months. Furthermore, after his contractual period, he would not be allowed to return to Germany without permission of his employer. That was the last straw; Volz declined the offer. However, even with these conditions, the United States was able to attract considerable scientific talent to the United States under Operation Paperclip, as the living conditions in Germany were harsh and there were limited opportunities for meaningful scientific work there. Walker, 1993, 179-181. From 1958, Volz was an ordinarius professor at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg. Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Volz. Internal reports The following reports were published in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics), an internal publication of the German Uranverein. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.

Life Garcin was born in Bourges. His maternal grandfather, Joseph Garcin, was director of a travelling company playing comic operas in the central and southern provinces of France. Having entered the Paris Conservatoire in adolescence, studying under Clavel and Alard, Garcin took the Premier Prix for violin in 1853, and entered the Op√©ra orchestra in 1856. He became solo violinist, then third conductor in 1871, and finally chief conductor in 1885. His long and successful teaching career at the Conservatoire de Paris began in 1875. Among his notable students were the child prodigy Henri Marteau (1874‚Äì1934) and Jules Boucherit (1877‚Äì1962). Garcin's association with the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire began in 1860, again as orchestral and then as solo violinist.Grove Dictionary - DAVID CHARLTON In 1885, he was elected principal conductor of the Conservatoire concerts. In this post he actively promoted German choral and symphonic masterpieces, from Bach's Mass in B minor (in 1891) to works of Brahms and Wagner (Brahms's music was then the object of much adverse criticism in Paris during the Franco- Prussian War). He was a founder-member of the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique in 1871. He wrote some music (including a violin concerto and viola concertino), a certain amount of which was published by Lemoine. Garcin also conducted the premiere of Franck's Symphony in D minor on 17 February 1889 at the Paris Conservatoire. This Symphony was dedicated to Henri Duparc, who was a member of \\"la bande √† Franck\\" at the Conservatoire, along with Vincent D‚ÄôIndy, Emmanuel Chabrier, and Paul Dukas. Three years later in 1892, Garcin retired and relinquished the post due to illness, but continued teaching. He died in Paris in 1896. He performed on violins by Antonio Stradivari, the \\"Il Cremonese\\" of 1715 (now known as the Ex-Joachim), another Stradivari (Cremona, 1731) (now known as the ex-Garcin), as well as \\"Le Messie\\", a copy of 1868 by Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume.Filimonov Fine Violins Accomplishments Prizes achieved include: 2nd Prix, solf√®ge, 1843; 1er Prix 1844; 2nd Prix, violin, 1851; 1er Prix 1853.

Life During the Morean War, Bujoviƒá took command of the forces of Perast, offering their services, in his own name and that of the people of the city, to the Republic of Venice, with whom he was deeply connected. The Venetians rewarded him well, enabling him to keep living in luxury; he built a palace and maintained a personal guard. In 1695 he assisted in an attack on Trebinje, and fought as well against north African pirates. Between 1694 and 1708 he was repeatedly elected a leader of the town. His palace was finished in 1694; on March 28, 1704, he was made a duke. Bujoviƒá provoked a quarrel with the Zmajeviƒá family, prominent locally, when he fled to Dubrovnik with the daughter of an Ottoman agha and had a child with her out of wedlock, who had been committed to the care of Krsto Zmajeviƒá; he spent several years in that town before returning to Perast. During her stay in Dubrovnik Agha's daughter converted to Catholicism and took the name Jela. The two later got married, their best man being notable painter Tripo Kokolja. On May 6, 1709, Vicko was provoked into and killed in a street fight by a member of the Stukanoviƒá family. For his involvement in the fight, Matija Zmajeviƒá was forced to leave Perast, eventually taking up service with the Russian Empire.

In machine- processed text, there is a long-standing practice of formatting transliterations in boldface and transcriptions in Italic type, as the two forms of rendering a runic text have to be kept distinct. Overview By not only showing the original inscription, but also transliterating, transcribing and translating, scholars present the analysis in a way that allows the reader to follow their interpretation of the runes. Every step has its challenges, but most Younger Futhark inscriptions are quite easy to interpret. Most Scandinavians can learn to read runic inscriptions with a little training. The Elder Futhark inscriptions, however, are much more challenging and they demand a great deal of knowledge in historical linguistics. Standard works such as Sveriges runinskrifter contain extensive presentations of the ways inscriptions have been interpreted throughout the centuries.Att l√§sa runor och runinskrifter on the site of the Swedish National Heritage Board, retrieved May 10, 2008. Runes ligature on the R√∂k runestone It is practically impossible to render the runes in all the various ways that they appear in the inscriptions, and so the way they look has to be presented in pictures and in drawings. Transliteration Variations of the ansuz rune. They are all transliterated as a. i Õ°≈ã bindrune. Transliteration means that the runes are represented by a corresponding Latin letter in bold. No consideration is given to the sound the rune represented in the actual inscription, and a good example of this is the ansuz rune, which could vary greatly in shape. In the oldest Younger Futhark inscriptions, it always represented a nasal a, as in French an, but later it came to represent other phonemes such as /o/. However, some runemasters continued to use the ansuz rune for an a phoneme. The ansuz rune is always transliterated as o from the Younger Futhark, and consequently, the transliteration mon represents Old Norse man in a runestone from B√§llsta, and hon represents Old Norse han in the Fr√∂s√∂ Runestone, while for√æom represents Old Norse for√∞om in an inscription from Repl√∂sa. Sometimes the runes are \\"dotted\\" which means that a dot has been added, and in transliterations dotted runes are treated differently from ordinary runes. Dotted u, k and i are transliterated as y, g and e though they are rather variations of the non-dotted runes than runes in their own right. Bind runes are marked with an arch. Some bind runes look in a way that makes it impossible to know which rune preceded the other, and then the scholar has to test the various combinations that give a comprehensible word. Thus all transliterations of bind runes are scholarly interpretations. Runes that are known from older depictions but that have since disappeared are rendered within square brackets. Transcription or normalization The runes are transcribed into normalized spellings of the languages the runes were written in, and normalizations are rendered with italics. Since a single rune may represent several different phonemes, normalizations can differ greatly from transliterations. The √æ rune can represent both the Old Norse letter √∞ (as in English the) or √æ (as in English thing).

History The British formed the South Persia Rifles in response to German influence in southern Iran in 1915 and early 1916. The German agents influenced tribal groups who were already in rebellion against the British. As a result, the British had to divert troops to Iran rather than Ottoman Iraq. The South Persia Rifles was a measure to use locally raised troops rather than British or Indian units, so that the latter could be sent to the main campaign against the Ottomans in Iraq. With the assent of the Shah‚Äôs government, the British were allowed to form a military force of up to 11,000 men to quell the resistive tribes and maintain order. Sir Percy Sykes was selected by the British to command the new force. In March 1916 he landed in Bandar-Abbas with a few British officers and non-commissioned officers, a company of Indian soldiers, and quantities of weapons and ammunition to equip the troops he recruited.Ward, p. 118 Most of his early recruits came from pro- British tribes. Sykes and his men spread out to cities in southern Iran such as Yazd, Esfahan and Shiraz, as well as Bandar-Abbas. Through the summer and fall of 1916 the South Persia Rifles conducted what to the British were mopping up operations.Ward, pp. 118-119 Sykes also gained formal recognition for the Rifles from the Iranian government. By December 1916, the South Persia Rifles had brigades located at Shiraz, Kerman, and Bandar-Abbas. Sykes had about 3,300 infantry and 450 cavalry, as well as a few artillery pieces and a machine gun.Moberley, p. 211 Training, equipment and organisation was along the lines of the British Indian Army. Winter closed many roads and brought the Rifles relief from tribal attacks. Sykes used the time to train his forces. In 1917, Sykes reached an agreement with the Qashqai tribe, ending their raids, allowing him to focus on other resistive tribes. The Rifles went after the tribes in their strongholds as well as their crops and livestock, crippling them logistically so they could not continue to raid British supply lines and garrisons.Ward, p. 119 By June 1917, the government that had agreed to the establishment of the Rifles fell, and the new prime minister and cabinet would not recognize them. Iranian attitudes towards the Rifles changed, and by late 1917 there was intense hostility towards the Rifles and the British.Ward, p. 121 The British even approached the United States with a proposal to take the Rifles over, but the US declined due to a lack of officers who could speak the language or were knowledgeable about Iran. In 1918 word of the worsening situation on the Western Front in France affected the morale of the Iranians in the Rifles and many deserted. The tribes in southern Iran became bolder, attacking Rifle outposts. The strength of the Rifles in April of that year was about 7,000.Moberly, pp. 476-477 Iranian resentment towards the Rifles only increased over time. Shia mullahs played a role in encouraging resistance to the British. The Shiraz brigade experienced poor morale, especially amongst the former genderamie in its ranks.Moberly, p. 319 That limited its use, and it was nearly disbanded. Desertions greatly reduced the size of the Fars brigade.Moberly, p. 373 The Kerman brigade remained loyal. Eventually more regular British units had to be sent to reinforce the Rifles. By October 1918, most tribal resistance had been broken.Ward, p. 122 After the war, the British continued to maintain the Rifles. In the years after the war, Iran was trying to recreate its armed forces and control internal unrest. While the British supported the development of a new army to keep out the new threat of Soviet influence, they realized that in the long run, the Iranians would not accept an army based on the Rifles, an organization run by foreigners.Ward, p. 128 Even so, the British were not willing to see it merged into the new Iranian Army. In 1921, they disbanded the South Persia Rifles.Ward, p. 131 Many former officers and NCOs from the South Persian Rifles later joined the new Iranian Army.Ward, p. 132 Notes References *David Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East (Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1989) *F.J.

A black flag was also flown from a high pole placed next to the monument and could be seen from the gravesite for several years afterwards.

Princeton, Illinois: Republican Job Printing Establishment, 1874. (pg. 262-264) In the summer of 1835, 23 Potawatomi warriors traveled over 500 miles to visit the gravesite of Senachwine. Their faces blackened and their heads wrapped in blankets, they performed a ritual invoking the Great Spirit to protect the gravesite and remains of the chieftain. According to a local resident observing the ceremony, the warriors spent several hours knelt around the gravesite as \\"their wails and lamentations were heard far away\\". The following morning they performed the \\"dance of the dead\\" which continued for several days before departing. A short time after, Senachwine's grave was robbed of its valuables including his tomahawk, rifle, several medals and other personal effects. The chieftains bones had also been scattered around the site. Members of his band returned to the site to rebury his remains and again placed a wooden monument over his grave. James R.

The light was warmed with an orange gel to match the sunset. Photographic lighting is the illumination of scenes to be photographed. A photograph simply records patterns of light, color, and shade; lighting is all-important in controlling the image. In many cases even illumination is desired to give an accurate rendition of the scene. In other cases the direction, brightness, and color of light are manipulated for effect. Lighting is particularly important for monochrome photography, where there is no color information, only the interplay of highlights and shadows. Lighting and exposure are used to create effects such as low-key and high-key.  Main sources  The main sources of light for photography are: *Daylight, which varies with the weather and the time of day. Different techniques are necessary to take best advantage of, say, brilliant sunshine, and an overcast evening. * Continuous artificial light, which may be normal lighting, or produced by special photoflood lights. The properties of different light sources vary; household incandescent lighting, fluorescent lighting, sodium discharge street lighting, etc., are very different and produce different results, and require different correction if a subjectively neutral rendition of colors is required. * A bright and very brief photographic flash from a single position (usually very close to the camera) or, in a studio environment, from several. * For special purposes lightning, electric sparks, fireworks, moonlight, or other light sources may be exploited. Perceptual cause and effect Lighting creates the 2D pattern of contrast the brain interprets to recognize 3D objects in photographs. In an in-person viewing experience the brain relies on stereoscopic vision, parallax, shifting focal in addition to the clues created by the highlight and shadow patterns the light on the object creates. When viewing a photo the brain tries to match the patterns of contrast and color it sees to those other sensory memories. The baseline for what seems \\"normal\\" in lighting is the direction and character of natural and artificial sources and the context provided by other clues. In the example, the photographer added a warming gel on the flash of the woman standing in a field in late afternoon light. The viewer knows the time of day from the angle of the shadows and neutral color balance would have seemed odd in that context. But similarly, the image of the woman if masked out and put on a plain white or neutral gray background would seem abnormally yellow. The goal in all photographs is not to create an impression of normality. But as with magic, knowing what the audience normally expects to see required to pull off a lighting strategy that fools the brain or creates an other than normal impression. Light direction relative to the camera can make a round ball appear to be a flat disk or a sphere. The position of highlights and direction and length of shadows will provide other clues to shape and outdoors the time of day. The tone of the shadows on an object or provide contextual clues about the time of day or environment and by inference based on personal experience the mood of the person. A skilled photographer can manipulate how a viewer is likely to react to the content of a photo by manipulating the lighting. Outdoors that can require changing location, waiting for the ideal time of day or in some cases the ideal time of year for the lighting to create the desired impression in the photo or manipulating the natural lighting by using reflectors or flash. In a studio setting, there is no limit to options for lighting objects to either make them look \\"seen by eye\\" normal or surreal as the goals for the photograph require. But more often than not the reaction on the part of the view will be from the baseline of whether the lighting seems normal/natural or not compared to other clues. Mistakes less-skilled photographer often make when mixing flash and natural lighting is not matching with the flash the highlight and shadow clues seen in the ambient lit background. If the background is illuminated by the setting sun but the face in the foreground appears to have been photographed at noon it will not seem normal because the clues don't match. The natural light baseline The sun hitting the front of objects facing the camera acts as \\"key\\" light creating highlights and casting shadows. Detail in shadows can be seen because the sunlight reflects off water vapor and dust the atmosphere creating omni-directional \\"fill\\". In open shade, 3D objects will also usually cast shadows because the downward vector of skylight is usually stronger than the sideways vectors illuminating the sides. When a photographer puts the sun behind an object its role in the lighting strategy changes from modeling the front of the object to one of defining its outline and creating the impression of physical separation and 3D space a frontally illuminated scene lacks. To differentiate that role from that of \\"key\\" modeling when a modeling source moves behind the object it is typically called a \\"rim\\" or \\"accent\\" light. In portrait lighting, it also called a \\"hair\\" light because it is used to create the appearance of physical separation between the subject's head and background. In natural lighting, the tone of the background is influenced by its reflective qualities and whether it is illuminated by the sun directly or skylight indirectly. So either the sun or sky, or a combination of both, can be the \\"background\\" lighting. Creating natural-looking artificial lighting Artificial lighting strategies that seem most \\"natural\\" duplicate the same contrast pattern clues seen on 3D objects in various lighting conditions. A typical studio lighting configuration will consist of a fill source to control shadow tone, a single frontal key light to create the highlight modeling clues on the front of objects facing the camera over the shadows the fill illuminates, one or more rim/accent lights to create separation between foreground and background, and one or more background lights to control the tone of the background and separation between it and the foreground. There are two significant differences between natural lighting and artificial sources. One is the character of the fill and the other is a more rapid fall-off in intensity. In nature skylight fill is omni-directional and usually brighter from above. That \\"wrap around\\" characteristic is difficult to duplicate with a directional artificial source. In a fixed studio location it is possible to bounce fill backwards off a white wall to flood the space with indirect reflected light similar to how the sun reflects off the atmosphere. Another way is to supplement a fill source from the direction of the camera with reflectors placed near the sides of the foreground subject. The Inverse-Square Law describes the predictable way a point light source radiates and changes in intensity with distance. As the distance from a source doubles, the area of the footprint of light increases by a factor of four, the square ^2 of the distance. Because the same number of photons are spread over four times the area when distance is doubled, the intensity at any point will be 1/ distance ^2 or 1/4 the strength. Photographic light sources are not point light sources so the law does not strictly apply but it explains why distance of artificial sources affects the character of lighting and lighting strategies in ways not seen in nature. According to the inverse-square law (intensity is inversely proportional to the distance squared) if the distance of a light source is changed in the following distance increments 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64 the intensity will decrease by one f/stop. Notice each step changes by the square root of 2. In practical terms, it means if one face in a group portrait is 4 metres from the \\"key\\" light and another is 5.6 m away, the face further from the light will be one f/stop darker. In an outdoor portrait of a group of 200 people taken on an overcast day, the lighting of all the faces will be equal. The same group photographed indoors would be far more difficult to light evenly. The simplest strategy requiring the least flash equipment would be to get above the group with the camera, have them look up and bounce the lighting off the ceiling so, like an overcast day, every face is as equidistant as possible to the apparent source of the light. Even something as basic as a head and shoulders portrait must take inverse-square fall-off into account by posing the front of the subject's face as close or closer to the \\"key\\" light than the shoulder or any other body part if the goal is to make the front of the face the most strongly contrasting focal point on a darker background. The position of the fill source relative to the face will also affect whether the nose shadow is the lightest (when fill is centered near camera) darkest (when fill is placed to the side) one on the face. The distance of the key and fill sources to the face will affect the rate at which the shadows transition from light to dark on the face. Creating surreal lighting Natural and surreal are just different sides of the same cause and effect coin. Understanding what makes lighting seem natural makes it easier to understand how to create other desired reactions. Natural light usually comes from above, so strategies which place the key light below the face will appear to be unusual or unnatural. The brain adapts color perception in a way that makes color balance seem neutral on white clothing and faces. The eyes also adapt to brightness as they scan and usually perceive a full range of detail in most environments. Lighting a scene with a tonal range or color cast which is out of context with what would typically be expected will cause the viewer to notice the environment and make other than normal assumptions about it. It is also possible to create the impression of environmental context where none is seen in the photograph, such as the look of a person standing under a streetlight at night by using a gridded flash attached to the ceiling of the studio with no fill source. Three light setup The three light setup is a standard method used in photography and, although is not the only method used, it is the most common. This method uses three separate positions that help the photographer illuminate the subject. It is formed by; the Key or main light, the fill light, and the backlight.

Similarly, a Royal Chase is a type of Crown Estate by the same description, but where certain rights are reserved for a member of the British Royal Family. Examples Examples of chases in England include the Wyre Forest that straddles the border of Worcestershire and Shropshire, Malvern Chase in Worcestershire, and Pensnett Chase near Dudley. Cannock Chase in Staffordshire has reverted to a chase (which like most chases has been partly reduced in size by settlements). It was in the Middle Ages a Royal Forest, although it merged with a chase around Beaudesert originally belonging (in most of the Middle Ages) to the Bishop of Lichfield. Rights and history The Victoria County History describes a chase as: > like a forest, uninclosed, and only defined by metes [houses and farmsteads > within] and bounds [hills, highways, watercourses etc];Edward Coke, The > Fourth Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England (1st ed, 1644) quoted > verbatim in 1797 > https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ulE0AAAAIAAJ&vq;=hampton%20court%20chase&pg;=PA301#v=onepage&q;=plainly%20appeareth&f;=false > but it could be held by a subject. Offences committed therein were, as a > rule, punishable by the common law and not by forest jurisdiction. Chases, often with more clearings than forests for hunting purposes, or due to their soil type, such as more heath, faced mass inclosure by Private (specifically local) Acts of Parliament primarily throughout the heyday of that type of privatisation 1600‚Äì1850. Inclosure converted from to some extent public to private land many chases. The private land after this has in many areas been converted, in part to residential, commercial, industrial or transport infrastructure use, however the chases listed here (see examples) remain largely undiminished by staying a common or by a gift to a public body whether to avoid inheritance tax or motivated by philanthropy. Misnomers A chase to which are attached particular officers and laws is legally a forest. So-called deer forests in Scotland are properly speaking chases as are other public \\"forests\\" without their own laws but with apportioned hunting rights over the whole area. Comparative status Chases and Royal Chases are beneath the status of forests designated as such and Royal Forests respectively. The word \\"forest\\" has since the late medieval period come to mean any large woodland. Virtually all of the National Park or AONB forests and significant other forests have officers and laws that apply only to them, making them forests in every sense of the word.

Japan-American Student Conference Logo Overview Each year, a group of students from universities in the United States and Japan spend four weeks living, traveling, and studying together. Students work to deepen the ties between the relations between the two countries through discussions about key topics in U.S.-Japan relations. The delegates collaborate with leaders in business, academia, and government on contemporary social, economic, and political issues that face the U.S., Japan and the world. JASC is student managed by 16 Executive Committee members from both countries who work in collaboration with International Student Conferences in Washington, D.C. and the International Education Center in Tokyo. History JASC is the oldest student-run exchange between these two countries. In 1934, a small group of Japanese university students concerned about the deteriorating relations between the United States and Japan initiated the first JASC in Tokyo. The following year, American students reciprocated by hosting the second JASC. This began the tradition of alternating host countries and holding JASC annually. Although World War II forced the suspension of JASC, it was revived in 1947 by Japanese and American students living in Japan. From its origin, JASC has been student-run, which ensures the creation of dynamic discussion focused on pressing current issues. Throughout its rich history, many JASC alumni from both nations have gone on to achieve distinction in business, academia, government and other circles. Program The conference venue alternates between Japan and the United States every year. Over the course of four weeks participating students visit 4-5 locations in the host country. During this time, they engage in academic round-table discussions, cultural and social events, lectures and panel presentations, field trips, and community service activities. These experiences provide a foundation for mutual understanding, social awareness, cultural sensitivity, and an exchange of ideas. More importantly, the bonds that form as a result of the 72 students living and working together will offer the basis for lifelong friendships that further strengthen the ties between Japan and the United States. In recent years the conference has attempted to include discussions of the rise of China as a major power in Asia by holding trilateral forums with Chinese students. Additionally, a new Korea-America Student Conference has been established to improve ties between the United States and its regional ally South Korea. =Roundtables= The core of JASC is the \\"roundtable,\\" a subgroup of ten students; four from the Japanese delegation and four from the American delegation, with one member of the Executive Committee from each delegation to act as roundtable leaders. The two Executive Committee Chairs do not lead a roundtable. Roundtable topics vary from year to year, and are decided by the Executive Committee for the conference. Roundtables aim to be diverse and cover a broad range of topics pertaining to U.S.-Japan relations. The 63rd JASC included the \\"Ethics of Technology and Its Impact on Human Life\\" roundtable, \\"Interpretation of History in International Relations\\" roundtable, and the \\"Comprehensive Security\\" roundtable, among others. Delegates spend much time in roundtable groups. Aside from discussions and debates, roundtables also embark on field trips to locations pertaining to the roundtable topic. 63rd JASC field trips included the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Niigata Prefecture, Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma and Camp Foster in Okinawa, and the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo. =Forums= Each site also features a forum where delegates engage in lectures with prominent experts and professors in numerous fields. Apart from these forums, delegates also prepare presentations for two forums of their own ‚Äì the Midterm and Final Forum. These forums are chances for each roundtable to present to the entire delegation the issues they discussed throughout the conference. Local high school and university students, as well as government officials and alumni are invited to attend these forums. =Receptions= Delegates also have the opportunity to engage in alumni receptions to network with past JASC alumni. Delegate selection American delegates are selected from all fields of study and will range from first year college students to Ph.D. candidates. Delegates need not be Asian studies majors or studying Japanese language because English is the primary language of the Conference. In fact, students of other disciplines are strongly encouraged to apply in order to broaden the depth of student representation. Applicants are asked to submit short essays, one longer essay, a writing sample, current transcript and letters of recommendation. Upon selection, delegates prepare a roundtable-related paper prior to the Conference.

Biondo was also the family underboss for approximately eight years. Career Born in Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto in Sicily, Biondo emigrated to New York City. He lived on New York's Lower East Side, where he became involved with future top Cosa Nostra members. Biondo stood at 5'4\\" and weighed 150 pounds. Biondo lived in the Jackson Heights section of Queens and owned a stately summer cottage in Long Beach, New York. He was married to Louise Volpe. Biondo's early criminal record included arrests for extortion, homicide, and illegal firearms possession. He was known to be a soldier in the Salvatore D'Aquila mafia family and was a bootlegging confederate of Umberto Valenti. In 1919, Biondo was convicted on a narcotics charge. In August 1922, Biondo was indicted on murder charges from a gang fight in which another gangster died, but the charge was later dismissed. In 1930, he was convicted of possessing a revolver and received a sentence of probation. During the Prohibition era, Biondo became involved in bootlegging. Biondo became close associates with bootlegger Dutch Schultz and mobster Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, and frequently served as an intermediary between them. In 1931, Biondo assisted Luciano in the assassination of Cosa Nostra boss Salvatore Maranzano. With the repeal of Prohibition, Biondo moved into labor racketeering in the taxi cab industry. During the 1930s, Biondo was close to the top, but stayed away from top position. Biondo owned a shipping business in Queens, a real estate office in Long Beach, and an automobile dealership in Flatbush, Brooklyn. In early 1938, Biondo was indicted on charges of extorting payments from taxicab companies. On July 13, 1938, a New York Police Department (NYPD) detective arrested Biondo in Queens after observing him driving with a female companion. Biondo cooperated in the arrest and was sent to jail. On June 24, 1942, a judge dismissed Biondo's 1938 indictment because none of the indicted men had been brought to trial. In 1957, Biondo and underboss Carlo Gambino conspired to assassinate family boss Albert Anastasia in a Manhattan barber shop. When Gambino took over after Anastasia's death, he appointed Biondo as underboss. In 1965, Gambino became dissatisfied with Biondo's independence and replaced him as underboss with capo Aniello Dellacroce. Working with mobster Sam DeCavalcante of the DeCavalcante crime family, Biondo had gained a share of revenues from a sanitation landfill in New Jersey. However, Biondo had hid this new revenue from Gambino to avoid sharing it with the family. DeCavalcante later revealed the deception to Gambino, who then removed Biondo from power. Death Joseph Biondo died in New York of natural causes on June 10, 1966. He is buried at the Maple Grove Cemetery in Queens.

Built in 1907, it was from 1930 to 1948 the home of Charles Evans Hughes (1862‚Äì1948), a prominent Republican politician and from 1930‚Äì1941 the Chief Justice of the United States. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972 and and is a contributing property to the Sheridan-Kalorama Historic District. It presently serves as the official residence of the Ambassador of Myanmar to the United States. Description and history The Charles Evans Hughes House is located in Washington's Embassy Row area. It is on the north side of R Street, between Sheridan Circle and 22nd Street. It is one of two stone row houses that are 3-1/2 stories in height, and modeled on an Italian palazzo. The ground floor is unpainted, with a flared glass-and-iron hood sheltering the central main entrance. A secondary entrance is in the rightmost bay. Second-floor windows are tall, and set in rounded arch openings, with shallow iron balconies. The third floor windows are rectangular, with bracketed stone window boxes. The house was built in 1907 to a design by George Oakley Totten, Jr. Its early uses were as either a diplomatic residence or embassy, including by the missions of Peru and Chile. In 1930 it was purchased by Charles Evans Hughes, recently appointed as Chief Justice of the United States. Evans was a leader in the Progressive Era of the early 20th century and 1916 presidential candidate. He held office as Associate Justice from 1910 to 1916, during which period he was a prominent dissenting voice on a conservative court. He held multiple executive positions under several Presidents before being appointed Chief Justice in 1930 by President Herbert Hoover. He lived in this house from 1930 until his death in 1948. In 1972, the building was purchased by the Union of Burma, now Myanmar. It currently serves as the residence of the Burmese ambassador.

It is the oldest suburb of Prayag at the bank of celestial river Ganges and not far from Triveni Sangam - the confluence of three sacred rivers: the Ganges and Yamuna, and the third invisible river Saraswati. Location Situated on the bank of the river Ganges, Daraganj is very cosmopolitan in the sense that a significant mix of Punjabi, Bengali , Marathi , Tamil, Telugu, Kannad and Gujarati communities, apart from natives thrive within a small area. Set up in a small village setting, Daraganj is a mesh of narrow lanes without any road signs. However, all of these lanes inevitably lead to the main road. This is the last bathing Ghat on the river Ganges before it joins the river Yamuna. The name \\"Daraganj\\" is presumably derived from the word \\"Dharaganj\\" meaning the place of the stream or current of water. Legend also has an alternative explanation that it is named after \\"Dara Shikoh\\", the elder brother of Mughal king Aurangjeb who was subsequently killed by Aurangjeb in the power struggle for the throne. Dara Shikoh was known to have studied Hindu Scriptures and translated many of the Upanishads and Puranas into Persian. Presumably, that translation work had taken place at Daraganj. Religious significance Allahabad religiously called Prayag is the king of all pilgrimage centers because Lord Brahma conducted first (pra) ten yajnas (yag) there at Dashaswamedh Ghat also located in Daraganj. Considering that Lord Brahma lives one hundred celestial years- equivalent to 311 trillion 40 billion earth years, and we are currently in fiftyfifth year of Brahma, and assuming that Brahma performed first ten Yajnas when he was twenty years of age, it is established that it happened 110 trillion years ago. \\"Lord BrahmƒÅ's day, consisting of his 12 hours, lasts 4 billion 320 million years, and his night is of the same duration.\\" (≈örƒ´mad BhƒÅgavatam 12.8.2-5) Lord Rama visited Prayag twice. The first stay was at Bharadwaj Ashram which still exists near University of Allahabad. Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshmana visited the Veni Madhav Temple during their fourteen-year-long exile and it was at Daraganj where \\"Nishad\\", the king of boatsmen, helped them cross the Ganges river. After killing Ravana,the \\"Pushpak Viman\\" carrying Lord Rama, Lakshman and Hanuman and the victorious army of monkeys and bears stopped over at Prayag again where Lord Rama and Lakshman did \\"prayashchit\\" for having killed Brahmanas. This happened 1.7 million years ago in Treta Yuga. NASA photographs confirm the bridge made of boulders between Sri Lanka and India and predict it to be 1.7 million years old. The famous debate between Shankaracharya and Mandan Mishra and his learned wife Bharati Mishra took place in 700 AD- Bharati Mishra was the judge. When the couple lost the philosophical debate and was about to enter alive in the pyre- according to \\"rules of engagement\\" in those days- Shankaracharya granted them pardon and right to live, and preach Vedic knowledge rather than Buddhism. About 500 years ago, Lord Chaitanya preached the essential principals of devotion to Rupa Goswami for ten days at Dashaswamedh Ghat. There is a plaque bearing the historic marking \\"Rupa Shikshsthali\\" at Dashaswamedh Ghat. Not far is another plaque bearing the foot prints of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu at Veni Madhava Temple, where Lord Chaitanya used to sing and dance everyday. Lord Chaitanya stayed for three nights at \\"Naag Vasuki \\" Mandir. About 500 years ago, Mirabai visited Daraganj and composed famous devotional poem \\"chalo man Ganga Yamuna teer\\". In 483 AD, Moghul Emperor Akbar named Prayag as Ilahabad - City of God- also called Allahabad. Founder of Arya Samaj Dayanand Saraswati too stayed at \\" Naag Vasuki \\" Mandir for three nights. It is an important religious center with hundreds of Hindu temples, such as Dashaswamedh Temple, Veni-Madhav Temple, Naag-Vasuki Temple,\\"Bhishma Shaiya\\", Bade Hanumaanji Temple, and Sri Jagannath Temple. Thus, it is considered inappropriate to skip the visit to Dashaswamedh temple after bathing in the holy river of Ganges at the Daraganj Ghat. Next to Daraganj is the \\"Alopi Devi Mandir\\", It is a temple dedicated to \\"Mother Sati\\", the wife of Lord Shiva. The story as told in Puranas suggests that the Alopi Temple was the place where the last remains of Mother Sati fell, when Shiva was sadly carrying them around the world. To bring Lord Shiva out of his mourning, Lord Vishnu threw his \\"Chakra\\" at the remains causing the remains to drop at various places on the earth. The last piece of the remains dropped at this place. Hence the place came to be known as \\"Alopi\\" meaning disappearance (of remains). Notable residents Daraganj is the home of the well known Hindi poet and writer, Mahakavi \\"Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala'\\" often known by his pen name \\"Niraala\\". Initially, Niraala was a native Bengali speaker and writer. When he got married, was encouraged by his non-Bengali speaking wife to write in Hindi and to write about the pains of an average man on the street, a job to which Niraala has no other match to compete with even today 45 years after his death. As a memorial to his contributions to Hindi literature, Niraala's statue has been installed at the main market square in Daraganj which now serves as a landmark for visitors and travellers known as ADDA. This place is in front of Daraganj Police Station. Daraganj is also home to well known academic statistician Ravindra Khattree who spent his early years in Daraganj. Hindi writer and painter Jagdish Gupt also resided in Daraganj for most of his life. Vinod Rastogi, a famous Hindi drama writer, was native to Daraganj. He worked for Allahabad Radio Station and acted in famous \\"Hawa Mahal\\"‚Äîa radio serial‚Äîas \\"Munsi Etwari Lal.\\" He has also written \\"Bahu Ki Bida\\", a drama, in the text book‚ÄîRang Bharti‚Äîfor the intermediate students of UP Board. Education It has a big Intermediate college named as Radha Raman Inter College in front of Daraganj Railway Station and behind Prayag Ghat Railway Station. Other Colleges are Maa Saraswati Inter College, Nirala Balika Vidyalaya, Navbharti Public School, Royal House Public School, Handia Baba Inter College and Mordern Nursery Primary School (1982‚Äì2000). Fine Classes (1998 ‚Äì present), Raj Coaching (2000‚Äì2010), Akansha Coaching (2000‚Äì2012) and Shukla Classes (2003‚Äì2007) are big names in Education. Festivals Moreover, Daraganj is a place for festivals. One can see a festival in every 15 days.these festivals are of native types which are celebrated mainly in daraganj and other very few places. Some of these are Vata Savitri,Ganga Dussehra,Dhendia,Bhai Duj,Parewa, Bada Ittwaar etc. Naag Panchami Mela at Naag Vasuki Temple in Daraganj is a unique festival where along with worshipping thousands of serpants, masses participate in shopping for fun and sing songs. Dussehra of Daraganj is famous all over its vicinity. Here Ramlila committee organizes the Dussehra in which Kali dance is famous, which is carried out for three nights of Navratri. Daraganj is the reference point for \\"Magh\\" fairs, held every year during winter and for \\"Kumbh Mela\\" fairs held every twelve years. On these occasions, an entirely new temporary town is created in the vicinity of Daraganj to serve the needs of the millions of pilgrims, with its own postoffice, bridges, police station and public services. During the \\"Kumbh\\" fairs Daraganj arguably becomes one of the most densely populated place on earth, when millions of pilgrims live within its small borders in the makeshift tents. Daraganj has its own railways station with the same name and has another major railway terminus train station known as \\"PrayagRaj Sangam\\" earlier known as \\"Prayag Ghat Railway Station\\".The station was awarded the cleanest station award in northern India by Northern Railways. Transport National Highway 19 (NH 19; previously NH2) runs through the middle of the Daraganj via Shashtri Bridge which links it to Allahabad and Varanasi. City buses, Tourist taxis, auto rickshaws (or tempos) are available for local transport. There are also city buses service run by UPSRTC as well as private operators that connects various parts of the city. But the most convenient method of local transport inside the city is the cycle rickshaw. Daraganj have two railway stations:- Daraganj and Prayag Ghat.

Buckingham House belonged to the Hudson's Bay Company and Fort George to the North West Company. For background see Saskatchewan River fur trade. Fort George Faced with a declining supply of beaver and the increasing unrest of plains tribes at Pine Island Fort, the North West Company moved 120 miles upriver and established Fort George. It was one of the several places also known as Fort des Prairies. Angus Shaw, who came south from Moose Lake (Alberta) was in charge for most of its history. Two of his clerks were Duncan McGillivray and John McDonald of Garth. Sixty to eighty men were there and an almost equal number of women and children. When news of the massacre at South Branch House reached them the men stayed inside the fort for six weeks and the men from Buckingham House moved into the NWC fort. In 1794-96 it produced 325 bales of fur and 325 bags of pemmican. David Thompson (explorer) spent the winter of 1799 at the post and found it dilapidated. By 1800 the local beaver had declined so much that it was abandoned in favor of Fort de l'Isle 20 miles upriver. In 1809 Alexander Henry the younger salvaged what he could and took it downriver to Fort Vermilion. Buckingham House Following Angus Shaw, William Tomison of the Hudson's Bay Company arrived with 28 men in October 1792. At various times Peter Fidler, George Sutherland James Pruden and Henry Hallet were in charge. It always had fewer men and less trade goods than its rival. Relations between the two posts were usually difficult but correct. During a drought the HBC tried to deny the NWC access to the HBC well. Access was restored when John McDonald of Garth told Tomison that either one or the other of them would visit the bottom of the well. Buckingham House was abandoned in 1800. Both posts were on a wooded north bank of the North Saskatchewan. A gully and a few hundred yards separated them. From 1993 there was an interpretive center. To the north were the posts on the upper Beaver River (Canada).

Unlike the rest of the album, \\"You'll Remember Me\\" was arranged by Mike Melvoin. The 2008 Collectors' Choice Music CD reissue of Make It With You also included the song \\"Pieces of Dreams (Little Boy Lost)\\" (the Oscar-nominated theme from the 1970 movie of the same name), which Lee recorded on June 1, 1970, between the sessions for Bridge Over Troubled Water and the sessions for this album.

Maclean's magazine was accused of publishing eighteen Islamophobic articles between January 2005 and July 2007. The articles in question included a column by Mark Steyn titled \\"The Future Belongs to Islam\\", an excerpt from a book written by Steyn. The Ontario Human Rights Commission ruled that it did not have the jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal heard the complaint in June 2008 and issued a ruling on October 10, 2008 dismissing the complaint. The Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed the federal complaint on June 26, 2008 without referring the matter to a tribunal. Komarnicki, Jamie, \\"Rights panel rejects action against Maclean's\\", The Globe and Mail, June 27, 2008 Canadian Human Rights Commission The federal Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) dismissed the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC)'s complaint against Maclean's in June 2008. The CHRC's ruling said of the article that, \\"the writing is polemical, colourful and emphatic, and was obviously calculated to excite discussion and even offend certain readers, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.\\" However, the Commission ruled that overall, \\"the views expressed in the Steyn article, when considered as a whole and in context, are not of an extreme nature, as defined by the Supreme Court.\\"\\"Canadian Human Rights Commission dismisses camplaint against Macleans\\" , Canadian Press, June 28, 2008 Faisal Joseph, lawyer for the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC), responded to the decision by saying that the CIC is disappointed the tribunal made its decision without hearing \\"the compelling evidence of hate and expert testimony\\" presented in the CIC's complaint to the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. Maclean's greeted the CHRC's decision stating that it \\"is in keeping with our long-standing position that the article in question, 'The Future Belongs to Islam,' an excerpt from Mark Steyn's best-selling book America Alone, was a worthy piece of commentary on important geopolitical issues, entirely within the bounds of normal journalistic practice.\\"Brean, Joseph, \\"Rights organization dismisses complaint against Maclean's\\" , National Post, June 27, 2008 The magazine also stated that \\"Maclean's continues to assert that no human rights commission, whether at the federal or provincial level, has the mandate or the expertise to monitor, inquire into, or assess the editorial decisions of the nation's media. And we continue to have grave concerns about a system of complaint and adjudication that allows a media outlet to be pursued in multiple jurisdictions on the same complaint, brought by the same complainants, subjecting it to costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars, to say nothing of the inconvenience. We enthusiastically support those parliamentarians who are calling for legislative review of the commissions with regard to speech issues.\\" British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal heard the case over a five-day period beginning on June 2, 2008; Mohamed Elmasry was not present. The co-complainant in this case is Naiyer Habib, the BC board director for the Canadian Islamic Congress, who filed the complaint on behalf of all Muslims in British Columbia. Joseph Faisal, legal counsel for the Canadian Islamic Congress opened his arguments by stating that the article Maclean's published presented Muslims as \\"a violent people\\" who hold traditional Canadian values \\"in contempt,\\" and depicted Islam as \\"inhuman\\" and \\"violent.\\" He also argued that the cover image that Maclean's chose to run, the image of two Muslim women, along with the magazine's cover line, \\"could have been the picture of a horror cult movie.\\" Faisal criticized 20 other articles that ran in Maclean's, beginning in January 2005 that he claimed were offensive to Muslims and criticized Maclean's for publishing letters from readers praising the magazine and Steyn. Faisal added that \\"We're prepared to deal with those articles piece by piece, paragraph by paragraph, and those things that we find objectionable.\\" Faisal and Habib's complaint claims that Maclean's and Steyn, who wrote the article, violated Section 7-1 of British Columbia's Human Rights Code, which stipulates that a person must not publish or cause to be published anything that discriminates against a person or group, or exposes them to hatred or contempt. Under the BC Human Rights code, the complainants are not required to prove harm, or malicious intent; all that is required is a reasonable determination that the excerpt did express hatred and contempt toward Muslims, and likely caused it to spread. Faisal implored the BC Human Rights Tribunal to take action, arguing that it is \\"the court of last resort. You are the only opportunity to right a terrible wrong to a clearly identifiable group numbering hundreds of thousands in this great country, and tens of thousands in the beautiful province of British Columbia. You are the only thing between racist, hateful, contemptuous Islamophobic and irresponsible journalism, and law-abiding Canadian citizens.\\" Mahmoud Ayoub, a historian of religion with a doctorate from Harvard University, testified that Steyn's claim in his article that Islam is \\"an underground movement trying to take over the world\\" has no basis in Islamic scripture or tradition. Ayoub disputed Steyn's interpretation of the word \\"jihad,\\" asserting that the word has a variety of meanings unrelated to violence. Ayoub also disputed Steyn's portrayal of Islamic extremism as mainstream saying that the extremist fringe represented less than one million of the total 1.5 billion Muslims. Lawyers for Maclean's argued that publication of the article is part of free speech and open debate. Julian Porter, the lead counsel for the magazine, asserted that Steyn's article \\"does not meet the standard of hatred or contempt, and that's what we'll argue later in the week\\". The lawyers for Maclean's did not call any witnesses during the week of hearings and instead argued against the complaint on constitutional grounds. In his closing arguments, Faisal stated that \\"There has never been a case in this country that has had such clear, concise evidence, ever. There will never be any more demonstrable evidence of hatred that has been perpetrated by this article.\\" Faisal also sharply criticized Julian Porter, one of Maclean's lawyers, stating that: > If [Mr. Porter] had his way, each and every Muslim in the country [would] > also bear the additional albatross that, apparently, we as Muslims in the > country are responsible, personally, for Osama Bin Laden. How ridiculous - > this is the type of mindset that prevails in the media. The Canadian Association of Journalists and the BC Civil Liberties Association presented a joint submission asking the tribunal to refine its interpretation of hate speech saying that previous rulings have been \\"overly expansive\\" and \\"have consequently brought the institutional legitimacy of the (tribunal) into question.\\" If Maclean's is found to have violated BC's Human Rights Code, it could face sanctions, including payment to the complainant \\"an amount that the member or panel considers appropriate to compensate that person for injury to dignity, feelings and self respect or to any of them.\\" However, Faisal has stated that he only wants the Tribunal to order Maclean's to publish \\"an appropriate response.\\" The Tribunal's hearing concluded on June 8, 2008. =Comments following the hearings= Steyn told the media that he was hoping the tribunal would rule against Maclean's. \\"We want to lose so we can take it to a real court and if necessary up to the Supreme Court of Canada and we can get the ancient liberties of free-born Canadian citizens that have been taken away from them by tribunals like this,\\" he said. Steyn was not called to testify at the hearing but was in attendance for several of the five days of the proceedings. The day after the hearing ended, Khurrum Awan, one of the complainants in the BC case, spoke to a meeting of the Canadian Arab Federation and complained that since Maclean's is not a member of the Ontario Press Council or any similar body there is no authority within the profession of journalism, that can \\"condemn the journalist, condemn the publication, direct them to publish a letter to the editor.\\" He added that he would \\"love\\" to see the case appealed into the regular courts.Brean, Joseph, \\"Muslims told to insist on equal voice in media\\", National Post, June 9, 2008 Awan also stated that: > And we have to tell them, you know what, if you're not going to allow us to > do that, there will be consequences. You will be taken to the human rights > commission, you will be taken to the press council, and you know what? If > you manage to get rid of the human rights code provisions [on hate speech], > we will then take you to the civil courts system. And you know what? Some > judge out there might just think that perhaps it's time to have a tort of > group defamation, and you might be liable for a few million dollars. At the Niagara-on-the-Lake conference of the Canadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies in June 2008, Wahida Valiante, national vice-president of the Canadian Islamic Congress, stated that the commissions are the only recourse available to minorities treated unfairly in the media since membership in press councils is optional and criminal hate speech charges require the consent of the federal Attorney-General. Valiante compared Steyn to James Keegstra, an Alberta high school teacher who taught and tested his students on how Jews \\"created the Holocaust to gain sympathy. They basically talk about the same theories. This is not a civil dialogue.\\" She said that, in Germany, long before the Holocaust, \\"it was the words that set the stage for what happened later on.... We may end up with the same fate, and that is at the heart of why [the complainants] wanted to take this on.\\" Haroon Siddiqui, a columnist for the Toronto Star, wrote that \\"Only genuine misunderstanding or deliberate distortion can explain the media's mostly one-sided discourse on the case of Maclean's before the federal, as well as the Ontario and British Columbia, human rights commissions.\\" Siddiqui asserted that the Canadian media \\"do not publish racist cartoons and anti-Semitic rants\\" and \\"that Maclean's published a series of virulent articles about Muslims itself speaks volumes.\\" Siddiqui also wrote that Mark Steyn's article was \\"a 4,800-word piece portraying Muslims as a menace to the West.\\". =Ruling= On October 10, 2008, the tribunal dismissed the complaint, stating that the Maclean's article did not violate the province's human rights law. The tribunal stated that the article contained historical, religious and factual inaccuracies, relied on common Muslim stereotypes and tried to \\"rally public opinion by exaggeration and causing the reader to fear Muslims.\\" However, they also ruled that the article was not likely to expose Muslims to hatred or contempt.Maclean's wins third round of hate fight by Joseph Brean, National Post, October 11, 2008. The Tribunal stated that \\"With all its inaccuracies and hyperbole, [the article] has resulted in political debate which, in our view, [B. C.'s hate speech human rights law] was never intended to suppress. In fact, as the evidence in this case amply demonstrates, the debate has not been suppressed and the concerns about the impact of hate speech silencing a minority have not been borne out.\\" =Comments following the ruling= Faisal Joseph, lawyer for the CIC, stated that he may appeal because the decision \\"sends the wrong message.\\" In a statement, Joseph wrote that \\"it is now acceptable for some columnists and media in this country to cloak freedom to hate in the mantle of freedom of speech.\\" However, Joseph also stated that: > Our objective of exposing Maclean's and Mark Steyn for their falsehoods, and > misrepresentation and stereotyping of Muslims has been achieved. We are > delighted the tribunal has discredited the content of the articles that > Maclean's and Mark Steyn have been publishing about Islam and Muslims. We > also appreciate the tribunal's citing of the vitriolic blogs related to the > Maclean's article as some evidence that the article exposes Muslims to > hatred and contempt...On the whole, however, the case was a leap forward in > the struggle against media-propagated Islamophobia. The fact that human > rights commissions in Ontario and B. C. have recognized the role of Canada's > national news magazine in promoting societal intolerance towards Muslim > Canadians and in publishing false and exaggerated material highlights the > urgent need for editors and newscasters to critically examine how they > represent Muslims in their news and editorial coverage. Mark Steyn, who wrote the offending article, stated that a lesser-known writer without a media conglomerate in his corner probably would have been convicted, adding that > For me the problem is not the book, the problem for me is Canada, and I will > never think of the deranged dominion quite the same way again. It has made > me understand just how easily and incrementally free societies, often for > the most fluffy reasons, slip into a kind of soft, beguiling > totalitarianism. I don't understand why they lack the cojones to find us > guilty and that \\"The only reason to go through all this nonsense is to get to the stage where you can appeal it to a real court, and if necessary up to the Supreme Court\\". Steyn further criticized the Human Rights Commissions and Canadian politicians, stating that > they didn't like the heat they were getting under this case. Life was > chugging along just fine, chastising non-entities nobody had ever heard > about, piling up a lot of cockamamie jurisprudence that inverts the > principles of common law, and nobody paid any attention to it.

Julian Porter, the lawyer for Rogers Publishing (which owns Maclean's) stated that the case illustrated how human rights commissions are neither trained nor equipped to rule on journalistic disputes, which require the delicate balancing of constitutional rights, stating that > It means that when you're making an editorial decision, you have to look > over your shoulder at this grey, fuzzy monster of the human rights > commission ...Suddenly, we're in a position where an immense group can, in > effect, bring a libel action without the libel defences [of truth or fair > comment]. =Other criticism= The complaints prompted criticism of the CIC from various writers as well as a federal cabinet minister, Secretary of State for Multiculturalism Jason Kenney, who said \\"attacking opinions expressed by a columnist in a major magazine is a pretty bold attack on the basic Canadian value of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.\\"Ditchburn, Jennifer, \\"Tory minister slams Islamic Congress complaint against journalist\\", Canadian Press, December 12, 2007 Brian Hutchinson, of the National Post, criticized the BC Human Rights Tribunal for agreeing to hear testimony from Khurrum Awan, one of the student lawyers who helped with the human rights complaint in Ontario on how Muslims in British Columbia were affected by the article. Maclean's argued that because Awan is not a resident of British Columbia, he should not be allowed to give testimony about the harm the article allegedly caused to Muslims in BC. However, Heather MacNaughton, the Chairwoman of the Tribunal, allowed his testimony, justifying the decision by stating that \\"strict rules of evidence do not apply\\" in cases before the Tribunal. Jason Gratl, a lawyer for the Canadian Association of Journalists and the BC Civil Liberties Association, criticized the hearing, stating that \\"We're of the view in the first place that the human rights tribunal doesn't have any business deciding what appropriate expression in Canada might be. Its activities and jurisdictions undermine the ability of journalists and members of the public to discuss important public issues such as race and religion.\\" Ezra Levant, former publisher of the Western Standard Magazine, and the former target of a complaint to the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission, opined that \\"I think this strikes at press freedom and even the freedom of thought of all Canadians. I think it's really an embarrassment that this is happening.\\" Ontario Human Rights Commission In April, 2008 the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) stated that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint, launched by Elmasry, based on a gap in the legislation (the relevant portions of the Ontario Human Rights Code only address discrimination via signs or symbols, not printed material). Despite not having jurisdiction, the Commission published a statement saying that Maclean's media coverage \\"has been identified as contributing to Islamophobia and promoting societal intolerance towards Muslim, Arab and South Asian Canadians\\". The Commission indicated that more discussion on the topic of Islamophobia in the media was warranted.Ontario Human Rights Public Statement. =Ruling= While it dismissed the complaint by the CIC against Maclean's, the OHRC also issued a statement saying the article in question \\"portray[ed] Muslims as all sharing the same negative characteristics, including being a threat to ‚Äòthe West‚Äô,\\" and thus promoted prejudice towards Muslims and others. In an interview, Chief Commissioner Barbara Hall stated that \\"When the media writes, it should exercise great caution that it's not promoting stereotypes that will adversely impact on identifiable groups. I think one needs to be very careful when one speaks in generalities, that in fact one is speaking factually about all the people in a particular group.\\" =Comments following the ruling= Response from Canadian Islamic Congress Faisal Joseph, a lawyer for the complainants, said he was \\"delighted\\" by the Commission's strong stance against the magazine, despite the failure of the complaint. He said he knew the complaint would probably be dismissed, \\"but we thought this would be an excellent way to demonstrate the gaping hole in human rights legislation in Ontario, and the [Commission] has done exactly that.\\" He also noted that other provincial human rights codes have provisions against published writings, and argued that it is \\"ridiculous\\" that Ontario does not. He said the inconsistency will require intervention by the Attorney-General to broaden the scope of the legislation.\\" Criticism of Hall and the OHRC Hall's statement drew criticism from a number of sources. Tarek Fatah, a founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress stated that for the Commission \\"to refer to Maclean's magazine and journalists as contributing to racism is bullshit, if you can use that word\\" and that the Commission has unfairly taken sides against freedom of speech in a dispute within the Canadian Muslim community between moderates and fundamentalists. \\"There are within the staff [of the Ontario Human Rights Commission], and among the commissioners, hardline Islamic supporters of Islamic extremism, and this [handling of the Maclean's case] reflects their presence over there\\" and that \\"In the eyes of the Ontario human rights commission, the only good Muslim is an Islamist Muslim. As long as we hate Canada, we will be cared for. As soon as we say Canada is our home and we have to defend her traditions, freedoms and secular democracy, we will be considered as the outside.\\" As reported by an article from Barbara Kay in the National Post, Fatah stated in a press conference (on October 2, 2008) that the OHRC has been \\"infiltrated by Islamists\\" and that some of its commissioners are closely linked to the Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation, both of which, according to Fatah, have \\"contempt for Canadian values.\\"Barbara Kay, The Islamist elephant in the room no politicians will acknowledge by Barbara Kay, National Post, October 2, 2008. Jonathan Kay, a columnist for the National Post also criticized Hall's leadership of the OHRC in the aftermath of the decision, writing that Hall was had been influenced by \\"radicals\\" in the OHRC bureaucracy. Kay also stating that the OHRC statement was \\"a genuinely frightening manifesto written by people who have a thinly disguised contempt for press freedom and heterodox opinions.\\" Kay argued that if a media outlet chooses \\"to be \\"unfair,\\" or simply to have an opinion that some people, or even everyone, disagrees with, that's our right. We'll pay the price in lost readers and advertisers.\\" Mark Steyn, who wrote the article in Maclean's that the complaint was based on, commented that \\"Even though they (the OHRC) don't have the guts to hear the case, they might as well find us guilty. Ingenious!\\" Hall's response In an interview, Hall defended her actions and her comments about Maclean's, stating that: > Every day we comment on things that aren't [formal] cases. Part of our job > is to identify discrimination and to work to address it, but more often it > is putting out a statement, having a debate, meeting with people, discussing > and understanding the impact. Whenever we comment on what someone has said > or done, we comment because we want them to think about the Human Rights > Code, and the implications of it, and to think seriously about what they're > saying or doing does to other people. I think that's an important and > legitimate part of our role... I think that part of freedom of speech is > being able to say things and another part of it is being able to be critical > of things that are said. I don't view it as a chill. I view it as > responsibility. Maclean's responds The editors of Maclean's denounced the OHRC for its \\"zealous condemnation of their journalism\\" accusing them of \\"morphing out of their conciliatory roles to become crusaders working to reshape journalistic discourse in Canada.\\" Maclean's alleged that Hall's press release was \\"a drive-by smear,\\" and \\"perhaps the greatest disappointment in this whole saga.\\" The editors claimed that \\"[Hall] cited no evidence, considered no counter- arguments, and appointed herself prosecutor, judge and jury in one fell swoop. If we weren't tolerant and charitable people, we'd be calling for her resignation.\\" OHRC's letter to Maclean's On April 2008, OHRC Chief Commissioner Barbara Hall wrote a letter to Maclean's, which the magazine subsequently published as a letter to the editor. Hall wrote that once that decision to dismiss the complaint was made, the OHRC was \\"free to comment on the issues raised. We followed the correct process for both aspects of our mandate under section 29 of the Ontario Human Rights Code ‚Äì protecting and promoting human rights in order to create \\"‚Ä¶ a climate of understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person‚Ä¶,\\" as set out in the Preamble. Hall further stated that: > Maclean‚Äôs and its writers are free to express their opinions. The OHRC is > mandated to express what it sees as unfair and harmful comment or conduct > that may lead to discrimination. We need to keep in mind that freedom of > expression is not the only right in the Charter. There is a full set of > rights accorded to all members of our society, including freedom from > discrimination. No single right is any more or less important than another. > And the enjoyment of one depends on the enjoyment of the other. This means > if you want to stand up and defend the right to freedom of expression then > you must be willing to do the same for the right to freedom from > discrimination. The human rights system exists in Canada, in part, to shine > a light on prejudice and to provoke debate ‚Äì and action. We called for > debate and dialogue; we still do. We have taken controversial views before > and no doubt will again. That is inevitable because we have a mandate to > promote change ‚Äì away from unfair stereotypes and discriminatory behaviour > and towards a culture of human rights. We agree with the Editors of > Maclean‚Äôs: critics are entitled to their opinions. Sometimes we must be > critical. We have that duty, enshrined in law, to speak up on human rights > issues of the day ‚Äì and we will continue to do so. Subsequent statements by Elmasry Elmasry stated that \\"You should understand there is a difference between criticizing a religion, OK, comparing it to another religion, and to make a mockery of the symbol of that religion. This is up to the legal system to decide.\\" Elmasry argued that Canadian law is deficient because it lacks the concept of \\"group defamation,\\" which he explained should be based on the principle that \\"There is (sic) individual human rights and there is (sic) collective, group human rights, and both of them are very important.\\"'We've been victimized' by Joseph Brean, National Post, November 22, 2008. Elmasry sharply criticized British Columbia MP Keith Martin, who proposed scrapping the hate speech provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Elmasry stated that Martin's proposal was \\"obviously\\" motivated by fear of Muslims.\\" Subsequent statements by Khurrum Awan In a subsequent interview with the Canadian Arab News, Khurrum Awan stated that, although the all of the complaints were dismissed, \\"We attained our strategic objective ‚Äî to increase the cost of publishing anti-Islamic material\\"; Awan claimed that Maclean's collective legal costs for the complaints was approximately $2 million.\\"Ezra Levant sued in \\"jihad chill\\" by Robert Sibley, Ottawa Citizen, January 26, 2010.

Roderick McKenzie Petrie (born 22 April 1956) is a Scottish football executive, who is currently the president of the Scottish Football Association. He was the chairman and chief executive of Hibernian F.C. for over 20 years. Petrie, who is a qualified chartered accountant and trained with Ernst & Young, has also served on the boards of the Scottish Football Association and Scottish Premier League. Career Petrie trained to be a chartered accountant with Ernst & Young, eventually becoming an audit partner in 13 years with the firm. He was then managing director of investment bank Quayle Munro for over six years. Petrie, who had advised Tom Farmer throughout his rescue of Hibernian FC (Hibs) from receivership in 1991, joined the club's board of directors in 1996 and was appointed managing director in 1997. Petrie was involved in the creation of the Scottish Premier League, but Hibs themselves missed the first season in the new top flight of Scottish football due to being relegated to the First Division in 1998. The club won the First Division at the first attempt in season 1998‚Äì99 and returned to the top division. A new, multimillion-pound main (West) Stand was built, to add to the new North (Famous Five) and South Stands already built during Sir Tom's ownership. Most Scottish football clubs hit financial difficulty in 2002 when the television broadcast deal with Sky Sports ended after the league and broadcaster failed to reach agreement on a renewal. Hibernian was one of the first Scottish clubs to react to the new financial landscape, taking action to reduce costs as quickly as possible. However losses accrued and added to the loan taken to develop the new stand, the club saw its debt level increase. Petrie, the only significant minority shareholder in Hibs, and the board explored options to reduce debt. Two options were identified: one was for the club to stay at Easter Road while increasing revenue; the second was to sell the Easter Road site to clear the club's debt and to share a proposed new ground in Midlothian with Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts, who also had significant financial problems. Hibs opened discussions with Hearts about the possibility of moving to Straiton, but this was met with a sceptical reaction by the Hibs support. Hibs then appointed former player and manager Pat Stanton to act as an \\"honest broker\\" in a public consultation process that followed. The result of the consultation was that Hibs decided to stay at Easter Road. The club launched a campaign called Stand Up And Be Counted to engage with fans in an effort to increase revenues. Land behind the east side of Easter Road was sold by the parent company after the Club identified the footprint of land it wished to keep for future redevelopment. The sale, to a housing developer (Westpoint Homes), helped to reduce the club's debt to a more manageable level after the parent company forgave a significant sum owed to it by the club. The club continued to exercise prudence in its financial dealings, with tight control of costs. = Hibs chairman = Petrie was appointed Hibs chairman in December 2004, after the resignation of Ken Lewandowski. After the appointment of Tony Mowbray as Hibs manager in May 2004, Hibs made a trading profit in four consecutive years. Hibs also received significant transfer income for Garry O'Connor (¬£1.6M),Garry O'Connor Completes move to Lokomotiv Moscow www.hibernian-mad.co.uk, 6 March 2006 Kevin Thomson (¬£2M), Scott Brown (¬£4.4M), Ivan Sproule (¬£0.5M), Steven Whittaker (¬£2M), and David Murphy (¬£1.5M) during this same period. Hibs also lost the services of Scottish internationalists Ian Murray,Hibs subsequently re-signed Murray, O'Connor, Riordan, Sproule and Thomson later in their careers. Derek Riordan and Gary Caldwell for little or no fee due to the expiry of their contracts. Despite criticism, particularly after the resignation of John Collins, that he has not used enough of these revenues on increased spending on players, Petrie has argued that the club has increased the budget for player wages four times and invested in a new training ground in East Lothian, while also reducing the net debt to under ¬£3M. Petrie's relationship with the Scottish media has also been a point of interest. Despite praise for his sure financial management, some journalists accused Petrie of being uncooperative. Petrie resigned from his position as chief executive in April 2008 and was replaced by Scott Lindsay, but has retained his position as chairman. Petrie stated that Lindsay would take over the \\"day-to-day running of the club\\", while Petrie would retain control of \\"executive duties\\", including the negotiation of player contracts and setting the player budget. Hibs continued to break even in the 2009‚Äì10 season, although this was due to the sale of players offsetting a trading loss. After manager John Hughes left the club by mutual consent in October 2010, Petrie received criticism from former player Paul Kane for his track record in appointing managers. The previous three managers ‚Äì John Collins, Mixu Paatelainen and Hughes ‚Äì had all left the club within 18 months of being appointed. Petrie was again criticised when Colin Calderwood was sacked after just over a year as Hibs manager. Hibs announced that two other directors, Scott Lindsay and Fyfe Hyland, would conduct the next recruitment process. After two years of declining attendances and financial losses, attendance stabilised in the 2012‚Äì13 season. Lindsay and Hyland both left the club during 2012, with other directors taking on their executive tasks. Hibs continued to struggle on the field, culminating in their relegation to the Scottish Championship in 2014. Petrie, who had made Terry Butcher his seventh managerial appointment in 10 years as chairman during the 2013‚Äì14 season, pledged to continue as chairman while overseeing the introduction of Leeann Dempster as chief executive. A group of fans, led by former player Paul Kane, called on Petrie to resign. Petrie left the Hibs board in July 2019, after American businessman Ronald Gordon acquired majority ownership of the club. = Scottish Football Association = Petrie has served on the committees of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) since 1998. He was elected second vice-president in 2011 (under the presidency of Campbell Ogilvie), and then became first vice-president under Alan McRae. Petrie was himself elected SFA president in 2019, without any opposition. His election was criticised by John Collins, who said he felt there were other people who could offer greater \\"passion and knowledge\\". SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell defended Petrie, citing his long service and he claimed that Petrie was \\"misunderstood\\" by the public. Soon after his election as president, the SFA completed a deal to purchase Hampden Park from Queen's Park.

A redundant church is a church building that is no longer used for Christian worship. The term most frequently refers to former Anglican churches in the United Kingdom,Disposal of redundant churches and other places of worship, GOV.UK, accessed 20 June 2018 but may also be used for disused churches in other countries. Reasons for redundancy include population movements, changing social patterns, merging of parishes, decline in church attendance (especially in the Global North) or other factors. Historically, redundant churches were often demolished or left to ruin. Today, many redundant churches are repurposed e.g. as community centres, museums, or homes; demolition occurs only if no alternative can be found. Anglican buildings Although some church buildings fall into disuse around the world, in England, the term \\"redundancy\\" was particularly used by the Church of England which had a Redundant Churches Division. In 2008, the Church changed the terminology surrounding church closure and as such \\"redundancy\\" is now known as \\"closure for regular public worship\\". The Redundant Churches Division became the Closed Churches Division.Closed Churches, Church of England, accessed 20 June 2018 The redundant Holy Trinity Church, Wensley, in North Yorkshire, England, has been vested in the Churches Conservation Trust since 2006 There are a number of reasons for a church building being declared redundant, although it is primarily due to a reduction in the number of regular Sunday worshippers, which fell since the late 1980s to about 1.7m in 2008.Church of England: \\"around 1.7 million people continue to attend Church of England services each month\\", 22 January 2010\\"Redundant churches: Pints in the pews\\", The Economist, 28 March 2002 Other reasons include the amalgamation of parishes, or a preference for another building where two churches exist in close proximity, for example at Swaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire. Population shift is another factor. For example, many redundant churches were formerly maintained in parishes situated in deserted or shrunken medieval villages (such as Wharram Percy in Yorkshire). The square mile City of London has only a few thousand permanent residents, far smaller than its historic population because most workers now commute from outside its boundaries, so there are many redundant churches within the City. Approximately 30 Church of England churches are declared closed for regular public worship each year.Closed Churches Division The buildings are only demolished as a last resort. Some active use is made of about half of the closed churches. Between 1969 and 2010, a full 1795 closures were achieved, equalling roughly 11% of the stock, with about a third Listed as Grade I or II. (Of these closures, only 514 were made since 1990.) Only 20% of closed churches were demolished and 75% of those were unlisted.http://www.theheritagealliance.org.uk/hrba/wp- content/uploads/2015/01/churches-and-closure-in-cofe-mar-2010.pdf, p=2 The aim of the closure process is to find new uses for them. Responsibility for doing this rests with the diocese. Some closed churches remain consecrated in occasional use by the Church of England. Some are purchased by other denominations or faiths for regular use. Several charitable trusts have been set up to preserve churches of particular architectural merit, such as the Churches Conservation Trust in England or the Friends of Friendless Churches in Wales (although the latter also maintains a number of churches in England). Similarly, Historic Churches Scotland cares for several former Church of Scotland church buildings. =Re-use= Closed churches can have a variety of uses. Depending on the listed status of a building, many can be converted for other uses. Several former churches are used as community or education centres, for example All Saints' Church, Bristol or All Saints Church, Harthill. Likewise, Holy Trinity Church, Chester now serving as the town's Guildhall or St Michael's Church, Chester as a heritage centre. St Peter's Church, Offord D'Arcy managed by the Churches Conservation Trust is used to host festivals, including a film festival. Others are used in more unusual ways; Old St Ann's Church, Warrington is an indoor climbing centre (one of several churches used in this way), other former churches may be art galleries, coffee shops and even pubs and clubs (e.g. High Pavement Chapel in Nottingham). Many are converted into residential properties. However, in some cases, such as the grade I listed St Ninian's, Brougham, a Churches Conservation Trust church, the remote location means that it cannot be used for an alternative purpose and is rarely used for worship. Methodist buildings The popularity of Methodism, and other non-conformist churches in the 19th century has led to many chapel buildings which cannot be sustained; at their height, various Methodist factions ran about 14,000 chapels in the United Kingdom. Today, the United Methodists own just over 6,000 chapels and dispose of roughly 100 each year. Particularly significant chapels may be taken into the care of the Historic Chapels Trust.

History In North America, the game was previously released as Space Cowboy Online through a portal known as gPotato, which was operated by Gala-Net. Space Cowboy Onlines client was made available for download on May 22, 2006, and the service went live on May 26, 2006. On December 26, 2007, Space Cowboy Online was shut down. This was announced to the public with a letter from Space Cowboys last active GM, \\"Xarfox\\". Following the closure of Space Cowboy Online, the European version of the game would be hosted under GameForge4D GmbH and renamed to AirRivals in early 2008 (originally, it was intended to be known as Flysis). The North American release would soon follow, with hosting from Suba Games beginning on September 26, 2008, titled Ace Online. Other publishers eventually followed, with Arario Corporation acquiring the license to host Ace Online in Japan and launching in the first quarter of 2009, while Axeso5 officially opened the first Latin American Ace Online server in February 2011. In 2016, GameForge4D GmbH relinquished the rights for hosting AirRivals , which were then handed to MasangSoft. Players were offered the chance to transfer their gears and in-game items to a new server, where the European version would once again be renamed, this time to Ace Online. Gameplay Collected kill points dependency on player level In Ace Online, players pilot their own individual starfighters (called \\"Gears\\") throughout a number of maps, including terrestrial, lunar, and space maps. It has typical MMORPG elements such as leveling, currency, a skill system and combat mostly based on player equipment and level. Ace Online is a largely player vs. player-oriented game (PvP), with character leveling and item acquisition achieved through combat against non-player characters and the completion of missions. After the conclusion of certain missions, more maps will be accessible to the player. Although a high level character will have better character attributes than most other players, no one at any level is invincible against other players in PvP. As in other MMORPGs, players can trade items, customize their gears, form parties (\\"formations\\") and guilds (\\"brigades\\"), and fight with other players via PvP combat. Almost all of the combat in Ace Online is aerial, from the third-person view. Players have the option to use an in-cockpit, first-person view. When players create their account, they can choose their fighter, each with different play styles. =Item shop and enchantments= Ace Online is a free-to-play MMO, with the option of buying in-game items via an \\"Item Shop\\" that can be accessed when the player interacts with the item shop icon in the bottom right corner of the screen, or by speaking to an NPC in the main hub. A player can only purchase the items from the item shop using currency that must be purchased through a website via a Ace Online account. There are many items available to purchase that affect a gear's weapons (e.g. change the trail effect of the missiles), stats (e.g. full reset or partial reset of stats), experience (e.g. increase experience rate) or others for a limited time. This item shop was made available to players on June 23, 2006. The item shop also includes \\"Weapon Gamble\\", \\"Enhancements\\", \\"Enchant Protection\\" and \\"Legending\\" services. Weapon Gamble allows weapons to be \\"gambled\\" and enchanted. This card randomly gambles the weapon stats with prefix and suffix to add extra attributes to the weapon. \\"Enhancements\\" affect a player's weapons and armor to boost performance, such as having faster missiles, higher rate of fire, or damage. To limit the power of weapons and armor, only five enchantments can be applied safely to a piece of equipment. For the sixth enchant and onward, there is a chance to break the weapon. =Nation War= Ace Online offers a PvP system of \\"Nation Wars\\", which revolves around a point system: \\"National Contribution Points\\" (NCP). The two nations in question are Bygeniou City United (BCU) and Arlington National Influence (ANI). Every time an enemy gear is shot down, the shooter's nation gains 1 NCP. NCP are also gained for other events, such as Strategic Points, Mothership wars, and Arena battles. Arena battles usually give a small amount of NCP compared to Strategic Points and Mothership wars. *Raids - The two nations (BCU and ANI) are separated by a series of maps. Nation Wars involve a constant battle between these two nations to raid and defend these maps, which provide strategic and economic advantages. For example, the boss monster \\"Pathos\\" only spawns in the BCU map \\"Zaylope Beach\\". Whoever controls \\"Zaylope Beach\\" will have the chance to destroy it and receive its rare drops if \\"Pathos\\" should spawn. Battling over these maps often results in tens of thousands of NCPs gained for either nation, speeding up the spawning of motherships (see below for motherships). Some of these maps are restricted to low level players, which they cannot access until a certain level or by fulfilling a certain condition (e.g. finish a particular mission). *Skirmishes - Random, unorganized battles, often on neutral maps. They are a major source of fame and NCP. The one and only objective in these wars is to kill as many players of the opposing nation as possible. These wars are often started by a single gear traversing through enemy territory. The nation leader of the defending territory will then inform players of this intruder, where they may respond and intercept. The intruder can call upon reinforcements or assistance. This encourages players to participate, where a skirmish sometimes transpires into a full war. These wars are heavily appreciated among the population. One of the most popular areas for these unorganized battles is \\"Bark City\\", as it is a neutral zone between the two warring nations. It contains wide open spaces, a repair shop, and access to four teleports, two of which only open during a time-specific event that either nation can participate in. * Mothership Wars - A major component of the game's core design. A nation leader (one elected for every month for BCU and ANI) can choose when a \\"mothership\\" - a stationary target which players must attack or defend - spawns. Each nation can only choose when the opposing mothership spawns, which they must defeat. If the mothership is not completely destroyed in two hours, it will despawn. Successful destruction of the enemy mothership grants the attacking nation a 5% increase in recovery rate of energy, shield, and skill points, also allowing access to the \\"Hornian King Habitat\\" and \\"Eopi\\", maps with exclusive mobs, bosses, and rare items. Successfully defending a mothership does not grant the defender any bonuses; instead, it prevents the enemy from receiving the reward. The BCU mothership, Anubis, spawns in Tylent Jungle, while the ANI mothership, Horus, spawns in Reynard Beach. Bonuses obtained from destroying/defending motherships are reset at the end of every month, as are NCP. The fourth mothership of each side that spawns also gives a special reward. In older versions of the game, motherships would spawn when a nation reached 100,000 NCP. This was likely changed due to scheduling conflicts among the population, which saw players waking themselves up at odd hours to participate, in fear of losing out on War Points which were required for highly desirable end-game items in the War Point Shop. * Strategic Points - Strategic Points are spawned in a random map at random times, and it will despawn one hour after its spawn if not destroyed completely. An announcement is made to all players of both nations which map the Strategic Point has spawned in. When a Strategic Point is destroyed, all attackers gain 300 War Points and a \\"SPI Capsule\\", which provides them with SPI (the game's currency). When a Strategic Point is successfully defended, the defending nation gains bonuses. If a Strategic Point is lost while defending players are in the same map or adjacent maps, they will gain 100 War Points. All players in the same map or adjacent maps as the Strategic Point will gain \\"Personal Contribution\\" which is a monetary reward based on the player's performance in combat. *War Points- Players can gain War Points from attacking/defending motherships, and Strategic Points. War Points can also be obtained in battles with the opposing nation. War Points allow players to buy unique items from the War Point Shop. These points can be used to buy stronger adhesives, armors, and other bonuses. *Nation Leader- Every month, players who are level 70 or higher, have 2000 fame, and lead a brigade (usually called \\"guild or \\"clan\\" in other MMOs) with at least 30 people that possess 1000 or more fame can run for the nation leader position. Multiple players can apply, and either nation's population can vote on who they want to have as their nation leader. Players who become nation leaders hold that title for a month until the next election. The nation leader of each side (ANI and BCU) obtains a leader mark and the leader adhesive. This provides them a defensive bonus, and the standard color for their name changes to a bright green, where they are easily identified. They are given special permissions, such as \\"Leader Chat\\" (a special type of chat function that allows their messages to be displayed to their entire nation, rather than a selective channel). They are also provided SPI (which the game brands as \\"war funds\\") upon completion of Strategic Points and Mothership Wars. The leader may also appoint two sub- leaders who can help them lead the nation. Leaders may set the time an opposing mothership spawns, up until a week before, at which point it cannot be changed. *Grinding Maps- Players from BCU and ANI will coexist in certain maps to \\"grind\\", where they can spend time leveling their gears. This mostly only occurs in grinding maps which contain an assortment of mobs that may require little effort to defeat and/or reward a fair amount of EXP. However, this coexistence between BCU and ANI is not a rule within the game itself; instead it is a player induced response to the game's naturally slow progression in later levels. =Duels= Ace Online contains a duel based system where players may challenge other players in either a 1 on 1 duel or \\"Formation Battle\\" (up to 6 players per formation). * 1 on 1 - A 1 on 1 duel can be initiated by one player challenging the other, in which the challenged must accept. If the duel is accepted, both participants receive a 5-second warning, after which there is an unlimited amount of time for either opponent to shoot each other down once. Should one of the players die under any circumstance (being shot down by the opposing player in the duel, crashing into terrain objects, being killed by a member of the opposing nation, or being killed by a hostile NPC) then the surviving player is declared the winner. Being disconnected results in a loss for the disconnected player, and moving to a different map will result in a loss, even if a player uses \\"Express City Return Portal\\" to teleport back to the city. * Formation Battle - A formation battle can be initiated with the command /formfight, which must be done by the formation leader. A formation battle may contain up to six players in a group (known as \\"Forms\\"), and can only occur if all members of both formations are in the same map, logged on, and if the challenged formation leader accepts the form fight request. Once a formation battle request is sent, no new players may be invited to the formation; existing formation members cannot be kicked; and the formation may not disband. A formation battle is won when all members of the opposing formation have been eliminated under any circumstance. If one member of a formation dies while the rest are still alive, they cannot respawn until the formation battle is won or lost.

According to Hammer, it is an exploration of the repression and marginalization of LGBT people since the First World War. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Teddy Awards, the film was selected to be shown at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016. Overview Nitrate Kisses combines interviews with homosexual couples, four same-sex couples making love, footage of 1933 homoerotic film Lot in Sodom and images of LGBT history. The couples making love are two elderly lesbians, an interracial gay male couple, two young pierced and tattooed women of color and an S/M lesbian couple.Foster, p.124 The scenes of the gay male couple are overlaid with the Motion Picture Production Code.Mellencamp, p.305 Part of the film focuses on the story of American novelist Willa Cather, who destroyed many personal letters and papers before her death; the film argues that Cather was covering up evidence of lesbianism. (Note, however, that such claims have been disputed by other scholars of Cather's life and career.\\"Cather did not label herself a lesbian nor would she wish us to do so, and we do not know whether her relationships with women were sexual.\\" Sharistanian, Janet. Introduction to My √Åntonia, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, p. xiii.) Another section explores the treatment of lesbians by the Third Reich.Holmlund, p.84 Background Hammer received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts to help finance Nitrate Kisses, which was her first feature film.Juhasz, p.85Hallam, p.53 She decided she wanted to make a film about the most marginalized groups within the queer community. When choosing which couples to film having sex, she decided to feature a mixed-race couple and asked two friends of hers, Jack Waters and Peter Cramer. She then met a young lesbian couple who were both women of color, and were pierced and tattooed, with shaved heads. She filmed them making love in a sculpture of a burnt out house, which Hammer felt represented \\"a history we don't have.\\" Next, she met a lesbian couple who arrived to shoot their scene with S/M paraphernalia.Juhasz, p.86 When looking for her fourth couple, Hammer decided that she wanted to explore ageism in the lesbian community. She went to an awards ceremony for older lesbians and chose a woman called Frances Lorraine who performed in the film with a friend. In an interview for Alexandra Juhasz's book Women of Vision: Histories in Feminist Film and Video, Hammer called Nitrate Kisses her best work. Distribution and reception Nitrate Kisses premiered at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on September 12, 1992 and has been shown at several other film festivals internationally. It was shown theatrically in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Austin, distributed by Strand Releasing. It was released on VHS on December 16, 1998. It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival. It won the Polar Bear Award at the Berlin International Film Festival and the Best Documentary Award at the Internacional de Cine Realizado por Mujeres in Madrid.

Thirteen of the nineteen buildings are contributing properties. Voorhees College was started by Elizabeth Evelyn Wright as the Denmark Industrial School, modeled on the Tuskegee Institute, which Wright had attended. She kept close ties with her mentor, Booker T. Washington. The school was a late 19th-century effort to provide education to underserved black children in a rural area. As the school matured, it became a normal school and eventually a four-year accredited college. The architectural and historical significance of this district is that it represents sophisticated styles for an African-American college in the early twentieth century. Many of these buildings were constructed by its students. In addition, the college was a pioneer in African-American education and associated with the notable educator and founder, Elizabeth Evelyn Wright. Photographs of some of the buildings are available. On January 21, 1982, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Of 13 contributing properties, several have significant architectural or historic importance: * Booker T.

Genie ohne Namen. Der Meister des Bartholom√§us-Altars (2001), the eventual result of an exhibition at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum. Career Almost nothing is known of his life, including his name; nevertheless, his hand is distinctive enough that scholars have found it fairly easy to trace his career. His name is derived from an altarpiece dated to between 1505 and 1510, depicting Saint Bartholomew flanked by Saint Agnes and Saint Cecilia. The painting is known to have hung in the church of St. Kolumba, Cologne; the inclusion of a Carthusian monk in the picture indicates a possible connection to the Carthusian monastery in that city. The identity of the Master remains unknown; it has been suggested, given the number of commissions he executed for the Carthusian order, that he may have been a member himself. It is now believed that, despite his associations with Cologne, and with German artistic circles, elements of his style suggest that the Master was initially trained in the Netherlands - a point of origin in Utrecht, or in the Gelderland region, has been posited. A Book of Hours, open to an identifiably middle Netherlandish text, in the hand of Saint Columba in a panel attributed to the Master conserved at Mainz,Pieper 2000. offers a clue to his cultural origins. It is further suggested that he emigrated to Cologne in about 1480. His early style may be seen in the miniatures he painted for the Book of Hours of Sophia van Bylant; the Flagellation in this collection is dated to 1475, the earliest date associated with the Master. The calendar in the book is that of the diocese of Utrecht; nevertheless, certain oddities of language indicate an affinity with Arnhem, which was also the home of the donor. Other early works, dated to the 1480s, include an Adoration of the Kings and a Madonna and Child with Saint Anne, both of which exhibit affinities with northern Netherlandish painting and may have been created in the Netherlands. Among the very few works attributed to the Master for which the original location is documented are a pair of altarpieces commissioned for the Carthusian monastery in Cologne by a lawyer, Dr. Peter Rinck, and the Deposition, now at the Mus√©e du Louvre, that was executed for the hospital of the Antonite brothers in Paris.Marjorie O'Rourke Boyle, \\"Coquette at the Cross? Magdalen in the Master of the Bartholomew Altar's Deposition 59.4 (1996:573-577). Style It has been said that the Master is the last \\"Gothic\\" painter to be active in Cologne. Approximately twenty-five paintings have been attributed to him on the basis of his highly individual style, which does not seem to bear any affinity to that of any other school then active locally. Despite the fact that he seems to have been the leading painter of his time in Cologne, no evidence of any followers, or of a school in the usual sense, may be found. A number of influences, mainly Netherlandish, have been traced in the Master's paintings. These include Dirck Bouts and Rogier van der Weyden,WGACartage whose influence may be seen in the Munich Madonna and Child with Saint Anne. Stylistically, the Master's paintings are characterized by their use of bright, enamel-like colors and an affinity to the International Gothic style of painting. Collections The Master's work may be found in a number of international museum collections. Three panels from the altarpiece which gave him his name are in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and the Deposition for the Order of St Anthony is at the Mus√©e du Louvre. There are four works in the National Gallery, LondonNational Gallery and a double-sided panel of the Journey of the Magi (or Three Kings) and the Assumption of Mary at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. A Baptism of Christ is in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

It thrives in a humid climate, prevailing in areas with cool and moist summers and warm and wet winters. P. glycyrrhiza can often be found growing on the trunks and branches of winter deciduous trees, particularly bigleaf maple, but is also often found on rocks, logs, and wet, mossy humus. It takes advantage of the mild, wet winters and the substrate of deciduous trees to photosynthesize and grow during the cold season when most other temperate plants are dormant. Habitat elevation is lowlands below 600 meters.http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi- bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?85,86,89 Licorice fern acquires its name from its licorice-flavored rhizome, which was chewed for flavor by numerous Native American groups, including the Squamish, Shishalh, Comox, Nuxalk, Haida, and Kwakwaka'wakw. The rhizomes were also usually used medicinally as a treatment for the cold and sore throats. Spores are located in rounded sori on the undersides of the fronds, and are released in cool weather and high humidity. This species is a diploid, and is one parent of several species of hybrid origin: *Polypodium vulgare (with Polypodium sibiricum) *Polypodium hesperium (with Polypodium amorphum) *Polypodium calirhiza (with Polypodium californicum)  Description  Licorice fern does not grow its fronds from a centralized location; this is contrast to other ferns that grow their fronds from the same spot. The name Polypodium refers to this characteristic‚Äîit means \\"many-footed.\\" The fronds are once-divided and triangular in shape, with finely toothed margins and pointed leaflets. They are usually at least one foot in length, but may grow to be over two feet long. They also display parallel venation. The rhizome is creeping and the fronds appear to have random placement, originating at various points. The rhizome appears reddish- brown, and is a sweet licorice-flavored. The name glycyrrhiza refers to this flavor--glykys in Greek means sweet, with rhiza meaning root. Since it is a fern, P. glycyrrhiza reproduces by spores; the spores grow in a pattern of spots on the undersides of the leaves. These sori may be oval in immaturity. Licorice fern may grow over the ground, rocks, or as an epiphyte. The plant prefers moist environments, so it is typically found on wet ground, rocks, and logs. Occasionally it can be seen on fallen trees. It is very often associated with Acer macrophyllum. The fern is mycorrhizal, meaning it can form root associations with the hyphae of fungi. The sweet flavor of the rhizome was once attributed to the glycoside glycyrrhizin. However, a study has shown that the flavor may actually be due to polypodoside, which is 600 times sweeter than 6% sucrose solution. The species is unrelated to licorice (genus Glycyrrhiza), which are among the Fabales order. Cultivation Licorice fern is cultivated as an ornamental garden plant. The cultivar 'Longicaudatum' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Use  The licorice fern is sometimes valued for its licorice-flavored rhizome. Occasionally it is chewed, and it can also be brewed into a licorice-flavored tea. It may be used as a medicine for colds and respiratory conditions by indigenous peoples. It is considered an important medical plant and may have been used similar to cough drops. Since the rhizome is so sweet even in its naturally occurring state, and since the chemical is not a saccharide, it is possible that this compound could be used as a natural alternative to traditional sweeteners.

Onuf is currently Professor Emeritus of International Relations at Florida International University and is on the editorial boards of International Political Sociology, Cooperation and Conflict, and Contexto Internacional. He is one of the primary figures among constructivists in international relations. Thought His best known contribution to constructivism is set out in World of Our Making (University of South Carolina Press, 1989). His approach is based on a continuum of performative language, rules and rule. Three types of speech act (instructive, hierarchichal, commissive) yield corresponding types of rule that, in turn, yield three types of rule (hegemony, hierarchy, heteronomy). Compliance with rules helps sustain rule, but failure to abide by them erodes rule. Rule, generally through institutionalized means, has distributive effects in political society (domestic or international), granting privileged access to material and symbolic resources to some agents over others. One novelty of this approach is to go beyond the 'anarchy problematique' in IR (Richard Ashley's term). Instead of different types of anarchy (as in Alexander Wendt's Hobbesian, Lockean, and Kantian anarchichal settings), Onuf presents hegemony, hierarchy, and heteronomy as different structures of domination in world affairs (i.e. the absence of world government does not necessarily imply anarchy). These structures are respectively enabled by the repetition over time of behavior consistent with instructive, hierarchichal, and commissive rules by agents. Instructive rules constitute reality: if one person utters the locution 'country X has moral superiority in world affairs', another person accepts it (illocution), and many other people act accordingly (perlocution), reality will have been constituted by this speech act. This may be converted into a number of instructive rules, which in turn, if followed over time, create, for instance, cultural hegemony. Hierarchichal rules work likewise but have to do with social relations based on force. Cold War spheres of influence are a classical example of their deployment in world affairs. Commissive rules create obligations for agents that would otherwise not exist: when an agent utters the locution 'I promise to make tariff cuts', such a statement can only exist in and through language and may be converted into a general rule. Such rules limit the agent's autonomy, resulting in a heteronomous structure of domination such as that found in the core-periphery setting of the world economy as expounded by Dependency Theory. Selected works Onuf further developed and refined the ideas set out in World in a series of chapters in edited volumes: *\\"A Constructivist Manifesto\\" in Burch & Denemark, eds., Constituting Political Economy (Lynne Rienner, 1997) *\\"Constructivism: A User's Manual\\" in Kub√°lkov√°, et al. eds., International Relations in a Constructed World (M.E.

The band has been recognized several times among the best in collegiate sports, promoting sportsmanship and civility, and has been hailed as \\"best pep band in Division III athletics \\". History DePauw Bands began in the early part of the 20th century. The earliest incarnation of a DePauw Pep Band can be found as far back as 1907 when the newly formed band played for a \\"jollification\\" event for the first Old Gold Day (later to be known as DePauw's homecoming). The Tiger Pep Band's creation date (1907) would make it the second oldest \\"scramble band\\" in the country next to the Columbia University Marching Band which was founded in 1904. While never losing its purpose of bringing joy and support for DePauw, Marching Bands took over shortly thereafter and continued on in one form or another until its final performance during the Presidential Inauguration Parade in honor of Alumnus Vice President Dan Quayle, class of 1969. During the later half of the 20th century, the DePauw Marching Band was led by Director of Bands and Alumnus Dan Hanna, class of 1947. Prof. Hanna, loved by his students, strongly believed that the Tigers playing on the field or the court should always know that regardless of the score, the musicians were always behind them. Hanna led bands at athletic events as large as 100 and as small as 15. Affectionately calling his marching band the Stumblebums, Hanna instilled a little zaniness into each performance including once having the marching band form the shape of a banana, begin peeling itself, all the while playing the stripper as they \\"stumbled\\" off the field during the Battle for the Monon Bell - which was televised nationally on ABC. He also created the long-standing \\"Tarnished Spit Valve Award\\" who he regularly gave to the largest \\"character\\" in the Stumblebums. The DePauw University Band appeared at football games in 1993 and 1994 after an outpouring of requests by students, faculty, alumni, and fans that musical support to athletes competing on behalf of the University. No band performed between 1989 and 1992. The Tiger Pep Band was founded on September 9, 1995, and first appeared at a DePauw University football match against Albion College. The first student directors were Jason Dibler and Christine Russell, and were selected by Director of Bands Dr. Craig T. Par√©. The TPB continued the tradition, established by Prof. Hanna, by traveling to Crawfordsville, Indiana when it appeared at the 1996 Battle for the Monon Bell at Wabash College . However, it was not until 2002 that the band made its triumphant return to post-season performance, supporting the DePauw Basketball men's and women's teams in their NCAA championship runs in Ohio and Indiana. This was the first time since the DePauw Men's Basketball Team appeared in the NCAA Division III Championship at Calvin College in 1984 that the Band performed out-of-state. Since its recreation in 1995, the TPB has become the leading cheering group for DePauw Tiger Athletics and has modeled itself in the form of a soccer supporter group. The TPB supports DePauw Athletics not only with music - both on field and from the stands - but also with chants (known as Spam), an assortment of signs, and a large variety of flags. The TPB's musical library has grown exponentially. Today, it can boast nearly five hundred pieces including DePauw's fight song, \\"Here's to DePauw,\\" and alma mater, \\"A Toast to DePauw.\\" The styles include rock and roll classics, top 40 hits, movie and TV soundtracks, and jazz standards. In the early part of the 21st century, TPB leaders believed it was time to revise the lyrics to the DePauw fight song in order to better represent the outstanding achievements of the University's women's teams. The reworded fight song was adopted by the University shortly thereafter and printed in the student handbook. It also created, named, and maintains the DePauw Athletic Mascot, Tyler the Tiger. Finally, as a way to show leadership and belief that \\"DePauw Never Quits\\", a member of the TPB leads athletic teams out onto the field of competition with a large, black flag containing a gold D. With this variety of music, as well as custom-authored cheers, unusual outfits, cooperative performances with other bands, and unique auxiliary units, the Tiger Pep Band was said by one out-of-state journalist to have a \\"Division I zaniness\\". Performances In addition to performing for DePauw University's own football and men's and women's basketball teams at home, the Tiger Pep Band has established a reputation for travelling on the road, which is somewhat unusual for Division III bands. In addition to annual appearances at the Battle for the Monon Bell between DePauw University and Wabash College, the band has been the official band of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference basketball tournament each year since it started in 2002. The band has also performed for several NCAA tournaments following the Final Four appearance and subsequent third-place finish of DePauw's women's basketball team in 2002. When DePauw' team lost in the Final Four and the band remained in the stadium to play for the championship game alongside Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology's Rose Pep Band, it so impressed NCAA officials that they named the bands as the best in the nation in Division III athletics and invited them to return as the official bands for the 2003 national basketball tournament. These performances were selected among favorite Final Four moments by a journalist from D3hoops.com, a popular Web site covering Division III basketball. Later, the Tiger Pep Band also appeared as the official band for the 2003 NCAA Men's and Women's Indoor Track and Field Championship and represented DePauw at the 2003 NCAA Tennis Championship. The band or its performance units have also appeared at non-DePauw events, including Greencastle, Indiana's holiday parade, at an Indianapolis Ice hockey contest, and Putnam County's annual Relay for Life event. By virtue of their performances at NCAA and SCAC tournaments and the Battle for the Monon Bell, the band has appeared on several television networks, including ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, HDNet, and Indianapolis' PBS affiliate. They are regularly heard on WGRE radio. Membership The Tiger Pep Band (TPB) is student-led, volunteer organization. Thus, membership has fluctuated during its tenure at DePauw University. At times, membership has been as low as 15 and as high as 100. The TPB is composed of two specific components: The Pep Band and the Tiger Team. The Pep Band, or the musician component, like many scramble bands, includes non-traditional band instruments called \\"miscie's\\" short for miscellaneous as seen in the Columbia University Marching Band and Stanford University Marching Band. In the past, members of the band have been known to play kazoos, Conga drums, vuvuzelas, bicycle horns, and other auxiliary noise makers, the band has even had a violin section and has included performers playing oboe, string bass, and electric guitar. The Tiger Team is the designated cheering leaders of the TPB. Formerly known as the Tiger Maniacs, the Tiger Team was formally adopted into the TPB in 2001 and are non-musicians responsible for leading the group and DePauw fans in cheers, yells, and other activities. The leader of the Tiger Team is the Capo - a term known in soccer supporters groups for the individual who leads the cheers. Other members maintain the DePauw mascot, run teams out onto the field with Big D, and more. Two groups that no longer are distinguished by their own designation are the Tiger Drumline and the Tiger Color Guard. The drumline appeared alongside and independently of the TPB from 2004 to 2006. The Drumline was not included in the 2008 revision of the TPB constitution due to insufficient participation to sustain the unit. The Color Guard began in 2006 and was a unique addition to a Division III athletic and stumble band. However, also due to lack of continued interest, it was discontinued in 2012. Traditions =Sportsmanship= The Tiger Pep Band has been recognized by NCAA officials and the media as an organization which displays a high degree of good sportsmanship, earning top honors in Division III athletics. This reputation has led to the band's invited appearances as the official ensemble of three NCAA national championship events and every SCAC conference basketball tournament since 2004. When possible, the band salutes DePauw's opponents before contests by performing their school songs, continuing a tradition from its predecessor, the DePauw Marching Band. When appearing as the official band at SCAC tournaments, the Tiger Pep Band plays the fight song for each competing school before, during, and after the game. Further, each year since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the TPB has reached out and invited its rival Wabash College to perform the National Anthem together. This invitation was finally accepted in 2009 and has continued since. =BIG D and Spirit Flags= Early in its history, parents of members of the TPB donated hand-sewn spirit flags for band members to use while cheering their team. By 1998, band members had begun taking the flags during a 100-yard sprint on the stadium track whenever the DePauw football team scored a touchdown. In 2000, the Tiger Pep Band added to its inventory \\"BIG D,\\" an eight-foot square black flag featuring an old gold letter 'D.' Soon, BIG D was the flag that was used to escort the DePauw teams on to the field or court, and was carried in the 100-yard touchdown sprints, as well as in victory laps around the basketball court. BIG D was stolen by students from Wabash College in 2002. It was quickly replaced by a black bedsheet spray painted with a D, named \\"BIG D, JR.\\" The Wabash administration agreed to pay to replace the original flag. Due to a manufacturing error, two flags were actually produced. One is known as \\"BIG D, III\\" and is also black flag with a (larger) gold 'D,' while the second flag is known as \\"DOUBLE D,\\" and is the same colors, but is unusual in that the 'D' reads correctly left-to-right regardless of which side the flag is viewed from. =Field and Parade Performances= Beginning with the 2002 Battle for the Monon Bell football game, the Tiger Pep Band began the practice of performing the \\"Here's to DePauw\\" and the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" from an on-field position. With the first performance of the next football season, the ensemble instated an on- field tunnel through with the DePauw football team runs when they enter the stadium, escorted by a Tiger Maniac running BIG D. After the DePauw Marching Band's final performance at President George H. W. Bush's 1989 inauguration parade in Washington, D.C., no DePauw band appeared in a parade until the school's 2005 homecoming festivities. Celebrating its tenth anniversary, the Tiger Pep Band stepped off in the first Old Gold Parade in recent history. The event was successful and continues annually. The band does not actually march, however, preferring to walk without trying to be in step. Called \\"stumbling\\" by band members, it is a reference to the DePauw Marching Band's nickname, \\"Stumble Society,\\" whose members were known as \\"Stumblebums.\\" (The DePauw Marching Band did in fact march in step, although the name was coined by then- Director of Bands Daniel H. Hanna, who conducted the bands at DePauw for over three decades.) =Inclusive and Cooperative Performances= After their performance experience with Rose-Hulman's Rose Pep Band at the NCAA Women's Basketball Championship in 2002, the two bands have established a performance relationship where they play as a single ensemble whenever the two schools' teams clash. The combined group performs both schools' fight songs. Although Rose-Hulman left DePauw's athletic conference in 2005, Rose Pep Band members still perform with Tiger Pep Band at the SCAC Basketball Tournament and at other events. The band has also performed cooperatively with the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater Warhawk Pep Band and the University Schools Band of the Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Humanites and Burris Laboratory School from the campus of Ball State University, as well as with members of the bands from Rhodes College and Centre College. In 2001, the TPB sought a cooperative performance of the national anthem with the rival band from Wabash College at the annual Battle for the Monon Bell football matchup. Wabash College finally agreed to perform the national anthem in 2009 and the two schools continue to do so. =Cheers/\\"Spam\\"= Early in the ensemble's life, band members would compose lengthy verses, which usually rhymed and contained words chosen to be awkward to pronounce. These were distributed to the band members who would cheer them on the way to the stadium and at other times during the game, frequently to the confusion of spectators who could not make out all the words. Often these cheers, known to band members as \\"Spam,\\" were often customized to poke fun at specific opponents. Membership Recognitions Since the Tiger Pep Band is a student organization, its members receive no formal recognition from DePauw University. According to the band's faculty advisor, Dr. Valarie Ziegler, motions in faculty meetings failed to give the band academic credit similar to that given to students in the DePauw University Band or the campus TV and radio stations. Instead, the band and its alumni ensemble counterpart, the Tiger Alumni Bands and Stumblebums, has established its own recognitions. Although the practice has been reduced in recent seasons, the band's student leaders would recognize graduating seniors each year with \\"Extraordinare Awards\\" which were customized for each student, in the style of \\"Pep Band Poet Extraordinare\\" or \\"Pep Band Paper-Hat-Woman Extraordinare.\\" In 2002, the Tiger Pep Band began issuing its own varsity letters upon receiving consent from university officials. The letters were distinctive from the ones given to athletes, and were denied recognition by the university's alumni association. Students elected to suspend the varsity letter after three years due to this lack of official support. To encourage continued support from the ensemble's graduates, the Tiger Alumni Bands and Stumblebums created two recognitions of its own. The \\"Non-Conformist\\" certificates recognize any alumni band participant, and are patterned after the DePauw Marching Band's traditional membership cards. The \\"Colonel of the Tiger Pep Band\\" award is given to alumni and individuals demonstrating sustained support for at least ten years. Only four recipients have been named since the award was created in 2005: Tiger Pep Band founding director Jason Dibler, DePauw University Director of Bands Craig T. Par√©, Tiger Pep Band faculty adviser and saxophonist Valarie Ziegler, and DePauw University Director Emeritus of Bands Daniel H. Hanna. The award certificate resembles the Sagamore of the Wabash award, the highest award given by the governor of the State of Indiana. The \\"Colonel\\" title was selected for its multiple significances to the band: It was Dibler's nickname, itself coined by Par√©, and was also Ziegler's undergraduate mascot.

Its fossils have been found in Greece, China, Iran, and Africa. It was first discovered by Wagner in 1857, and contains nine species, O. rothii, O. atropatenes, O. jiulongkouensis, O. noverca, O. robustus, O. stenocephalus, O. lishanensis, O. wegneri, and O. tanyceras. Former species include O. grangeri (Pilgrim, 1934), now recognized as the genus Sinomegoceros, and O. xiejiaensis (Li and Qui; 1980), now recognized as the genus Sinopalaeoceros. Oioceros somewhat resembled a gazelle. Description Horns In 1997, an almost complete skull of O. rothii proved that it was similar to Samotragus praecursor, with a short face, compared to its relatively long braincase, and isolated horn cores. However, unlike S. praecursor, O. rothii had a jaw of primarily premolar teeth, which were longer than the molars found in the latter. Pilgrim and Hopwood described the genus as being \\"small size with long slender muzzle; face bent down on basicranial axis either slightly or to a moderate extent; orbits with expanded orbital roof; horn-cores twisted counter-clockwise in a fairly close spiral of one or two revolutions, widely separate, tilted backward or fairly upright, divergent, with a cross-section almost circular or elliptical, keeled either anteriorly or posteriorly or both; dentition moderately hypsodont, premolar series rather long and slender, molars broad with ribs of medium strength\\" (Pilgrim and Hopwood, 1928, p. 24). The horn cores of Oioceros have a torsion. Species *Oioceros rothii was first named by Wagner in 1857. He originally had the specimen he had found in Pikermi, Greece, under the name \\"Antilope rothii\\". In 1902, Gaillard reassigned the species to Oioceros rothii. *Oioceros atropatenes was first named by Rodler & Weithofer in 1890. *Oioceros jiulongkouensis was first named by G. Chen and W. Wu in 1976. *Oioceros noverca was first named by Pilgrim in 1934. *Oioceros robustus was first named by Chen and Wu in 1976. *Oioceros stenocephalus was first named by Chen and Wu in 1976. *Oioceros wegneri was first named by Andree in 1926.

This was due in large part, to the empire's policy of allowing conquered rulers a fair amount of autonomy as long as they paid tribute and provided military contingents when ordered.Fage, page 315 The asantethene during this period was Kusi Oboadum, who had ascended the throne in 1750. During his reign, the southern states under Asante's influence such as Denkyira, Wassa, Twifo and Akyem became openly hostile and threatened the empire's commercial routes to the coast. This was not only a threat to Asante's commercial interests but to its national security, since its supply of firearms came from the coast.Pescheux, page 449 Casus belli In 1763, the Asante vassal kingdom of Akyem under its King Pobi Asomaning II, the Okyenhene, made contact with the Kingdom of Dahomey while planning a rebellion with other dissidents within the empire, including the Kwahu and Brong. Meanwhile, the bantamahene, one of the major Asante military officers,Thornton, page 68 had been relentlessly pressuring Asantehene Kusi Oboadum for war. Bantamahene Adu Gyamera had even gone so far as to threaten the ruler's impeachment. The asantehene did not order an invasion, however, until learning that the Akyem had sought out aid from the Oyo Empire. The battle Sometime in 1764, the Ashanti army marched out to invade the Dahomey. The exact size of either force is known. What historians are sure of is that the Ashanti army was ambushed in or near Atakpam√© in what is now Togo. A force of Dahomean infantry, including the kingdom's elite Ahosi corps of female soldiers, as well as levies from the Oyo Empire, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Ashanti army. During the battle, the Juabenhene (head of the royal clan of Oyoko) was killed. The Ashanti army never reached Dahomey and was forced to retreat. Aftermath News reached European merchants trading with the alliance had inflicted a severe defeat on the Ashanti. The consequences were far reaching in that the unpopular asantethene was removed and replaced by the more youthful Osei Kwadwo. There were fewer documented confrontations between Ashanti and Dahomey in the early 19th century, but peace was the norm between them. This particular battle caused Asanteman to refocus its foreign policy back to its original goals rather than spreading itself too thin.Thornton, page 79 See also * History of Togo * Ashanti Empire * Kingdom of Dahomey * Oyo Empire Footnotes Sources  Category:Military history of Africa Category:Battles involving the Ashanti Empire Category:Ashanti Empire Category:Dahomey Category:Military history of Togo Category:Conflicts in 1764 Category:1764 in Africa Category:Oyo Empire ","title":"Battle of Atakpam√©"},{"id":"17359569","text":"Kipsigicerus is an extinct genus of East African antelope from the Middle Miocene.

Baton Rouge Gallery is one of the United States' oldest artist co-ops and an important aspect of Baton Rouge's arts community. History The Baton Rouge Gallery was founded in 1965 when eight artists formed a gallery to showcase not only their own work but also that of other local artists. The original eight were reflected in the gallery's original name, The Unit 8 Gallery. The gallery gained incorporation in 1966, having grown to include twelve artists, and became known as Baton Rouge Gallery. In 1984, the gallery moved to City Park. The pavilion where the gallery is located was originally the park's pool house, built in the 1920s and closed in 1963. When the Gallery celebrated its Silver anniversary in January 1991, its 25 years of operation were believed to be a record for a unique art gallery and the gallery's development mirrored that of Baton Rouge's arts community. Until a brief closing in April 1994 due to a controversy over an artist's work, the gallery was the nation's oldest professionally run artist co-op and still remains one of the longest-running. Today, the gallery not only has an artist member roster of over 50 contemporary artists who work in a wide array of mediums, but also offers a wealth of programming that have become favorites in and around the greater Baton Rouge area, including its Movies & Music on the Lawn program. The gallery also hosts national and regional juried exhibitions throughout the year including the Surreal Salon (January, highlighting the quality & popularity of contemporary surrealism and the pop-surrealist movement in the United States), the Flatscape Video Art Series (February, featuring contemporary works in video art from across the U.S.) the CFA REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCE Juried High School Exhibition (April, honoring the work of high school students in East Baton Rouge Parish) and Venus Envy (April, celebrating the work of female artists living in Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida.)

History  In The 1950s, a network of rural credit cooperatives was created. At this time, they were not commercial enterprises similar to banks, but rather channeled credit between the state and the people's communes in rural areas.Kellee Tsai, \\"Imperfect Substitutes: The Local Political Economy of Informal Finance and Microfinance in Rural China and India\\" World Development 32:9 (September 2004): 1487‚Äì1507. In the late 1970s, after economic reforms enabled some individual entrepreneurialism and the creation of collective enterprises, the RCCs began to function as grassroots banks that provided credit and savings accounts to families and collective enterprises. In the reform era, the RCCs were intended to serve as a means for the Agricultural Bank of China to funnel credit into rural areas. However, the RCCs were insufficient to meet the high demand for credit in these areas.Kellee Tsai, Back-Alley Banking: Private Entrepreneurs in China(Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 2002), 152. Individual and enterprises often turn to other sources of credit, which range from rotating savings and credit associations to pawn shops. However, these other forms are all illegal (although some are tolerated to a greater degree than others, and are tolerated in some locations more than in others). Commercial banks are legal, but since fewer than one percent of loans from state banks go to private entrepreneurs, they do not meet the credit needs of rural areas.Tsai (2002), 2. Until 1996, the RCCs were supervised by the Agricultural Bank of China. In 1996, they were transferred to the People's Bank of China.Tsai (2002), 152. In July 1998, the rural credit foundations (RCF) () were banned when the State Council of the People's Republic of China () issued the \\"Provisions on the Cancellation of Illegal Financial Institutions and Activities\\". This left the RCCs as the only legal financial institution (other than banks) that served rural enterprises and individuals. As of 1998, when the RCFs were banned, there were approximately 44,000 township-level RCCs and 280,000 village-level RCC branches.Tsai (2004), 1489. Since 1998, many of the RCCs have gradually been transformed into rural commercial banks (RCBs). The first foreign investment in an RCB was allowed in 2006, when Rabobank and the International Finance Corporation (the private sector arm of the World Bank) acquired stakes in the United Rural Cooperative Bank of Hangzhou.IFC News ‚Äì Press Releases & Features ‚Äì Press Release  Challenges  Due to a high volume of non-performing loans, many of the RCCs are technically insolvent. Since 1998, central banking authorities have injected approximately US$4 billion into recapitalization the RCCs, and have considered other measures for improving the performance of the RCCs. Although the RCCs are gradually being transformed into independent commercial banks (RCBs), they are still not immune from government requests to make policy loans (loans issued for political reasons, such as the desire to support certain politically important industries or firms, rather than because the firm is an attractive candidate for a loan).Tsai (2002), 208.

The plane was shot down by a large-calibre machine gun and the pilot was killed as his parachute did not open after ejecting. Despite the efforts of the Sudanese and Russian governments to conceal the incident, news of his death was leaked by the independent Echo of Moscow radio station in Russia and the Sudanese newspaper Alwan (which was promptly closed down for having \\"disclosed sensitive military information harmful to the country‚Äôs security and its accomplishments\\"). JEM forces entered the city of Omdurman, targeting the Arba'een military base and the Al- Aswat police station. Government troops backed up by tanks, artillery, and helicopter gunships were immediately deployed to Omdurman, and heavy fighting raged for several hours. The rebels then started to move towards the Al-Ingaz bridge to cross the White Nile into Khartoum in an apparent attempt to reach the Presidential Palace, while another JEM force headed towards the National Radio and Television building in Omdurman. Both attacks were repelled by government forces.

Prejudicial press coverage of the case prior to the trial suggested Adams was guilty and that the verdict would be a foregone conclusion, but Lawrence successfully secured an acquittal.Devlin, Patrick. Easing the passing: The trial of Doctor John Bodkin Adams, London, The Bodley Head, 1985. Adams, if convicted, night have been hanged, had he also been found guilty on a second murder indictment that had been brought. Devlin at the time and later investigation suggested Adams was acquitted in part due to inadequate prosecution preparations and also due to the lack of strong and credible evidence. Early life The son of a master butcher and a singing teacher, Lawrence was educated at the City of London School before going up to New College, Oxford. He enjoyed a variety of sports, but his main recreation was music, being an accomplished pianist and violinist. He was President of the University Musical Club. After graduation he acted as tutor to two sons of Jan Masaryk, travelling with the family to the United States of America, and Prague. They remained close friends until the murder of Masaryk during the Czech coup in 1948. Having decided to enter the law, Lawrence was awarded a Harmsworth scholarship and became a pupil to Eric Neve, being called to the Bar in 1930 from Middle Temple. Career Before the Second World War Lawrence had built a respected general law practice on the south-eastern circuit. In 1944 he acted as junior to Sir Walter Monckton in a disciplinary hearing against Flight Lieutenant Pensotti, an RAF judge advocate who had been court martialled for interfering with the papers of another court martial in 1943. Lawrence and Monckton effectively turned the hearing into a retrial of the original case (despite the absence of the original witnesses), and the disciplinary hearing took no action against Pensotti, but the original court martial verdict stood. After the war, Pensotti attempted to clear his name and this first brought Lawrence's name to the attention of the press. Lawrence now began to specialise in planning, parliamentary and divorce cases. Time magazine described Lawrence as a \\"puckish, mousy little man with a mind as orderly as a calculating machine\\". Cullen describes him similarly as \\"used to digesting boring technicalities\\", though Robert Hounsome highlights his \\"magnetic oratory style. 'Certainly no-one, other than his brothers (both in the legal profession) can make such polysyllables as \\"cerebral\\" and \\"respiratory\\" sound like something out of Keats'\\"Robert Hounsome, The Very Nearly Man, 2006, page 183 He first achieved judicial office in 1948 with his appointment as Recorder (a part-time judge) of Tenterden. He was appointed a King's Counsel (KC) in 1950, and in 1951 he was appointed as a member of a Royal Commission investigating the laws on marriage and divorce (Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce). In 1952 he was appointed Recorder of Canterbury, and in 1953, Chairman of the Court of Quarter Sessions for West Sussex. In 1957 Lawrence defended John Bodkin Adams and in 1958 he successfully defended Charles Ridge, Chief Constable of Brighton, England, who was charged with conspiracy to obstruct the course of justice by taking bribes. Lawrence was chairman of the Bar Council from 1960 to 1962. In 1962 he was appointed to chair the National Income Commission), the Commission was dissolved in 1965. He was knighted in the 1963 New Year Honours. In 1964 Lawrence was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex, and chaired the Committee on the Remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament (known informally as \\"the Lawrence Committee\\").Catalogue information for series PRO 41/1, records of the Committee on the Remuneration of Ministers and MPs (the Lawrence Committee), The National Archives. Retrieved 13 May 2008. He was appointed a High Court judge on 30 September 1965, but fell ill not long after. He died in 1967. Bodkin Adams case Lawrence made his name defending Dr John Bodkin Adams. Adams was arrested in 1956 for the murder of two elderly widows, Gertrude Hullett and Edith Alice Morrell. He was tried for the murder of the latter in 1957 with the prosecution, led by Sir Reginald Manningham- Buller, alleging that he had killed her with excessive doses of heroin and morphine for mercenary motives. Lawrence was hired by the Medical Defence Union to defend Adams, making this Lawrence's first capital case. Indeed, Time magazine described Lawrence as \\"a relative stranger in criminal court\\". He was assisted by Edward Clarke QC and junior counsel was John Heritage. Lawrence's conduct of the defence was admired by many. On just the second day of the trial he dropped a bombshell. While cross-examining a witness, one of the nurses who had taken care of Mrs Morrell, some \\"notebooks\\" the nurses had kept were mentioned. Unfortunately they had long ago gone 'missing'. Lawrence summarised the situation: \\"If only we had those old books we could see the truth of exactly what happened.\\" To the surprise of all but the defence team, he then produced eight notebooks which had been written by the nurses, detailing their and Adams' treatment of Morrell. The entries differed markedly from the accounts in witness statements produced by the police from testimony obtained in 1956. The prosecution was wrong-footed and never fully recovered from the notebooks showing far less opiates had been given to Mrs Morrell than had been suggested in the opening prosecution speech. Testimony from expert witnesses for the prosecution, Dr Arthur Douthwaite and Dr Michael Ashby, was rendered ineffective as they had prepared their hypothesis of murder by opiate poisoning based on the police evidence of the amounts of opiates prescribed and the assumption that everything prescribed had been administered, without having had access to the detailed evidence of amounts administered in the notebooks. When they attempted to adjust their evidence to take the notebooks into account, they were accused by Lawrence of being inconsistent. Lawrence again surprised the court with his decision not to call the defendant as a witness.Ockham's Razor ‚Äì 23 July 2006 ‚Äì The Strange Case of Dr John Bodkin Adams Although it was not obligatory for the defendant to give his or her version of events, and a defendant's legal right to silence had been acknowledged since the turn of the 20th century, when it first became legal for a defendant to give evidence in their defence under oath,) it had become usual for them to do so. Therefore, when Lawrence announced that Adams would not speak in his own defence, it surprised many present in court, with Devlin considered that Lawrence was taking a risk in not allowing Adams to enter the witness box, although conceding that Adams' garrulousness was a credible reason for that strategy. Most surprised of all was the prosecutor, Manningham-Buller. He had been expecting Adams giving evidence, and being able both to provoke him onto making the sort of damaging admissions that the police had recorded and discrediting his explanation of events. When this opportunity was not presented, the prosecution strategy was thrown into disarray. Lawrence is also remembered for his final address to the jury:lawinaction.ca Adams was acquitted after just 44 minutes and the case made Lawrence's reputation. Personal life In 1941 Lawrence married Marjorie Avice. She survived him and they had no children. In his spare time Lawrence was an accomplished violinist, having played first violin for the orchestra of the Oxford Bach Choir under Sir Hugh Allen.

Worn primarily during summer, it is fine, transparent, and looks best when worn over another color. Used for female clothing, it was popular until the first decade of the 20th century.\\"Mechlin.\\" The Oxford English Dictionay. 2nd ed. 1989. It was made in Mecheln, Antwerp, Lier and Turnhout. It was used for coiffures de nuit (evening hair-styling), garnitures de corset (corset trims), ruffles and cravat.  History  Its history goes back to the Brabant laces. Originally the term 'mechlin lace' was used for any bobbin lace from Flanders. Mechlin lace grew in popularity throughout the late 17th century and the 18th century, and was mentioned several times. The 1657 inventory of the Mar√©chal de la Motte included 'a pair of Mechlin ruffles'. Jean-Fran√ßois Regnard, when visiting Flanders in 1681, wrote of the lace and lace-makers. When the English prohibition was removed in 1699, Mechlin lace became the grand fashion in England, and it was advertised in the London Gazette. It was very popular at this time in France and Holland as well. The earliest with a r√©seau (open net) ground wasn't made until 1720, and at this point the term became specific to this lace with the open net. In 1755 Mechlin lace went into decline in England, and by 1834 there were only eight manufacturers left. Machine-made Mechlin lace started to be produced in 1819. Another machine was invented in 1847 which exactly followed the hand movements a lace-maker would make. Manufacture has since died out. Mechlin lace was also very popular with the English royalty. Queen Mary II, in spite of the prohibition against imported laces, purchased two yards of knotted fringe for her Mechlin ruffles in 1694. Queen Anne purchased quite a bit of it‚Äî 83 yards in 1713. George I had a Mechlin cravat, and it was a favorite of Queen Charlotte and Princess Amelia. Appearance Mechlin lace is known for its rich floral patterns, fine twisted-and-plaited, hexagonal ground, and its outlined designs. It looks much like Brussels lace, however it is made all at once, with the r√©seau or ground made at the same time as the pattern on the pillow. Also, the plait is shorter, and the mesh smaller than those of Brussels lace. All Mechlin laces are outlined with a loosely spun silk cord used to define the pattern, whereas Valenciennes lace isn't. Mechlin lace is also more expensive than Valenciennes lace, as it takes more time to make because of the different r√©seau. Sometimes Mechlin is grounded with an ornamental r√©seau, instead of the usual hexagons. In the regular hexagonal r√©seau, the two sides parallel to the long axis of the lace are plaited three times, and the other four sides crossed. The same threads pass across the whole width, and thus form both the ground and the pattern. Mechlin net is a machine imitation of the Mechlin lace ground.

On August 5, he had an American flag flown from his village and allowed Levering to enter as to receive the letter from Clark. He told Levering that he was willing to cooperate with Clark, at least to the best of his ability, and called a council of the local chieftains. Levering left some tobacco as a gift for the council while they visited other villages upriver. Gomo encouraged other chieftains to attend and hear the address of the governor for themselves so that he would not be accused of treachery or of being a \\"sugar mouth\\". Held on the morning of August 16, the Potawatomi discussed the escalating violence and horse stealing against the settlers. The council refused to turn over the perpetrators, although they eventually agreed to return the horses. Little Chief returned two horses to Captain Nathan Heald at Fort Dearborn while Gomo promised to return the rest. The murderers of the Coles party were also found in a village 20 miles west of Tippecanoe.Davidson, Alexander and Bernard Stuve. A Complete History of Illinois from 1673-1873.

Princeton, Illinois: Republican Job Printing Establishment, 1874. (pg. 198) as well as eighteen other minor chiefs and warriors. During the conference, Edwards warned the Gomo and the others of British ambitions in the region. Although he assured the Potawatomi that the United States government had no intentions of forcing the Potawatomi from their lands, Gomo and the others were reluctant to accede to their requests. During the War of 1812, his village was one of a number of Potawatomi settlements destroyed during an expedition by the Illinois Rangers. Under orders from Governor Edwards, a detachment of Illinois Rangers set fire to every major Potawatomi settlement on the Illinois River between Edwardsville and Quincy, Illinois.Perry, Albert J.

A left-arm slow roundarm bowler with a remarkable capacity for drift, his most famous achievement was taking all ten wickets in an innings for the Players against the Australians in 1878. On three occasions, he took over 100 wickets in a season. His Wisden obituarist wrote of his bowling, \\"At his best Barratt was certainly a very fine slow bowler, being able on certain wickets to get more work on the ball than almost any other cricketers of his generation.\\" Bowling style Standing 5'8\\" tall and weighing 11 st. 4 lbs, he spun a long way from leg and was especially effective against batsmen reluctant to use their feet. He had a deadly quicker ball, which went on with the arm, but his primary proclivity lay in floating the ball up to the bat, about a foot to the offside, and turning it a few inches away. WG Grace saw many \\"an impatient or thoughtless batsman 'spooned' in trying to hit\\"; indeed, even the \\"good\\" ones were prone to slashing wildly at it and often fell foul of the extra offside fieldsman that Barratt had in play. Grace gave Barratt little credit: \\"It was all owing to the eagerness of the batsman, who could not resist the temptation to hit out at everything off the wicket. A little thought would have shown that stepping back and cutting it, instead of hitting it on the rise, was the right way to treat it; or that quickness in running out and hitting before it pitched would have been equally effective.\\" It is a mark of Barratt's respect for Grace and his brother EM that he never bothered with this ruse against them; indeed, he was often completely at their mercy, especially in the case of EM, who habitually destroyed his confidence. Playing career season by season A plumber by trade, Barratt's first engagement as a professional cricketer was at the Longsight club in Manchester in 1870 and 1871. He was taken on the Lord's ground staff in 1872 and made his first-class debut that same year with great success, taking 8/60 for the North against the South at Prince's Cricket Ground in a fixture beginning on 16 May. He played twice more that season for North v. South,In 1877, he would play in a match for the South against the North. as well as in four games for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), to whom Grace, taking a keen interest in his progress after first encountering him at Swindon, had recommended him. In seven matches, he took 25 wickets at an average of 13.48, with five or more wickets in an innings three times. In spite of this success, his next first-class match was not until 1876. In 1873, he was employed at Prince's Cricket Ground and, in 1874, moved to the Surrey ground staff. In both 1874 and 1875, he also played for his native Durham. He qualified for Surrey by residence in 1876, and played for them until 1885. In 13 first-class matches in 1876, he took 36 wickets at an average of 19.38, not particularly good given the generally poor pitches of the time. He had few pretensions as a batsman‚Äîalthough strong on the slog, he had a weak defence‚Äîbut that season made his highest score of 67, the only time that he reached fifty. He played in 18 matches in 1877 and was given more bowling, so that he finished with 92 wickets. His average, however was similar to the previous season‚Äî20.02. He did much better in 1878. 20 matches brought him 135 wickets at 14.04. He took five or more wickets in an innings on 15 occasions and five times took 10 or more in a match. He appeared to take a particular liking to the touring Australians. Playing for Surrey against them, he returned innings figures of 8/58, at last improving on the 8/60 he had taken on debut back in 1872. But, later that season, he surpassed this. Appearing for the Players at The Oval, on 2 September he returned innings figures of 10/43. The Australians nevertheless won by eight runs in a low-scoring affair: none of the four innings reached 100.Scorecard of Players v Australians at The Oval, 1878. The feat of taking 10 wickets in an innings against an Australian touring side was not repeated until Jim Laker did so twice, once for Surrey and once for England, in 1956.David Lemmon, The History of Surrey County Cricket Club, Christopher Helm, 1989, , p245. He lost form in 1879, taking only 10 wickets at 31.50 in seven matches, and never represented the Players again, kept out by the likes of Alfred Shaw and James Southerton. He played only six times the following season, but his figures were much better: 29 wickets at 17.65. The next four seasons were productive ones. In 1881, 14 matches brought him 82 wickets at 19.57. The following year was slightly better, with 15 matches producing 94 wickets at 16.93. 1883 was his most productive season: 21 matches, 148 wickets at an average of 15.90, with 18 five-wicket innings and six 10-wicket matches.His wickets that season exceeded his runs, which totalled only 126. He was not quite so effective in 1884: the same number of matches as the previous year yielded him 121 wickets at 18.17. 1885 proved to be his final season with Surrey. In 10 matches, he managed only 15 wickets at 26.40 and was not selected for any fixtures after the middle of July. \\"It was rather hard luck on Barratt,\\" wrote Grace, \\"that when he represented Surrey the eleven was not only weak, but had very little fast bowling. In many matches he was kept on too long because there was no one good enough to relieve him, and the consequence was that the batsmen got set and hit him. Nothing disheartens a bowler so much; and these circumstances must be taken into consideration in forming an estimate of the good work he did for his county.\\" Barratt played only one further first-class match after leaving Surrey, turning out in July 1886 for CI Thornton's XI against the Australians. Although he was no longer playing for Surrey, the county granted him a benefit match at The Oval in 1887, the fixture against Yorkshire. Later life He occasionally umpired during his playing career as this was part of the duties of senior professionals on the Oval staff. He was one of the umpires used in major matches during 1889 and 1890, standing in seventeen first-class matches. In January 1889, Barratt became the landlord of the Duchy Arms, a public house not far from The Oval. Two years later, he died there from consumption at the early age of 46 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery Notes References *Grace, William Gilbert: Cricket (J.W.

Emblematic of Portuguese medieval military architecture, the Castle of Santa Maria da Feira is one of the monuments that best reflects the diversity of defenses used during the Middle Ages, having been instrumental in the process of Reconquista and autonomy of the County of Portugal. It has been listed as a National monument since 1910. History A reenactment of the medieval fair that gave rise to the Castle's name The interior courtyard and main keep of the Castle of Feira The courtyard interior with medieval exterior walls and parapets Tradition has it that the Castle of Feira stands on the site of an indigenous temple dedicated to the local divinity Bandeve-Lugo Toiraeco, which was later transformed into a Marian temple. Although tombstones and other vestiges encountered in the defensive area confirm the presence of Roman settlement dating back to the early empire, there is no confirmation of the link to other temples. In the vicinity of this site existed the Roman via Olissipo-Bracara Augusta connecting Lisbon and Braga, respectively. When, in the middle of the 9th century (868), Alfonso III of Le√≥n created the administrative and military region, that he called Terra de Santa Maria, he laid its defences in the military fortress that existed there, in Civitas Sanctae Mariae. For many years, the fortress functioned as a forward base in the Christian Reconquista from the Arab invasions from the south. Twice in 1000, the armies of Al-Mansur conquered the Castle and destroyed the local population, but they were retaken successively by Christian forces. During the reign of Bermudo III (1028‚Äì1037) Arab continued to attempt to capture the Castle, but were defeated definitively in the Battle of Ces√°r. The governors, Mem Guterres and Mem Luc√≠dio developed a giant project to reconstruct the Castle and develop the lands of the Terra de Santa Maria. The Leonese kings distinguished the population with the Honra de Infan√ß√µes, an honour at the time only received by the judges, magistrates and councilmen of Lisbon. The first reference to a built structure in this location occurred in the 11th century, in the Chronica Gothorum, identifying the construction of the inferior portion of the keep and fortress. Since 1117, Feira was the location of one of the most important fairs in Portugal, which, over time, gave the town its name. The fair was established in the shadow of the castle. The castle was at the centre of the 1128 revolt between Afonso Henriques and his mother Queen Teresa, Countess of Portugal. Teresa had created tensions between the rulers of the Iberian peninsula through conflicts with her sister Urraca, and later rebuking Alfonso VII (her nephew), resulting in his invasion of the County of Portugal. Teresa also alienated the clergy and nobles, pandering to her alliance with Galicia, through her lover Fernando P√©rez, and favouring the ecclesiastical pretensions of the rival Galician Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, Diego Gelm√≠rez. The clergy and nobility allied themselves with Afonso Henriques pretensions to the stewardship of the County of Portugal over his mother. Pero Gon√ßalves de Marnel, from a family of landholders, governor of Santa Maria da Feira and alcade of the Castle at the time, was one of these nobles who felt threatened by the growing power of Galicia within the County: he had been substituted as the governor of Coimbra by Fernando P√©rez himself, and saw a threat to his wealth, prestige and possessions, and therefore aligned himself and his Castle with the Afonso Henriques at the S√£o Mamede. The Galician-supported forces of the Queen were defeated on 13 June 1128, partly due to the activities that occurred at the Castle. By 1251, the settlement in Santa Maria da Feira was identified in the royal inventory ( of King Afonso I. The castle and lands of Feira were provided as a dowry in 1300 on the nuptials of Elizabeth of Aragon in the 13th century. During the 14th century, the walls were finally constructed, likely at the time Gon√ßalo Garcia de Figueiredo was alcalde in 1357. On 10 September 1372, King Ferdinand donated the lands of Santa Maria to Jo√£o Afonso Telo, Count of Barcelos. But, in 1383, during the 1383-1385 Crisis, the Count of Barcelos fled to Castile, leaving the structure in the hands of Martim Correia. This change later facilitated its capture by men loyal to the Master of Aviz, John, in 1385. On 8 April 1385, the territory comes under the stewardship of √Ålvaro Pereira by King John I, cousin of the Constable Nuno √Ålvares Pereira, before being conceded to Jo√£o Rodrigues de S√°. In 1448, it is donated to Fern√£o Pereira, who was obligated to reconstruct the castle, which was only completed in the second half of the 15th century. Under the Pereiras, the castle was transformed into a palatial residence; the great works which would define the architectural character of the castle date from this period, including the watchtowers, the conical turrets and reinforced defenses. The fourth Count of Feira, Diogo Forjaz, orders the marker/inscription that was erected over the barbican to commemorate the construction of the clock tower (which existed until 1755).Maria Helena Barreiros (2001), p. 46 During the 17th century, the construction of internal palacete was concluded (which has since been destroyed: the only remnant being a local fountain). It was also around this time (1656) that Joana Forjaz Pereira de Meneses e Silva, Countess of Feira, ordered the constructed of the octagonal-shaped Baroque chapel. But, after 1708, the Counts of Feira were extinct, and their possession were passed onto the Casa do Infantado, marking its long decline and ruin. Due to abandonment the castle was devastated by a fire on 15 January 1722. Its ruins were purchased during a public sale by General Silva Pereira in 1839. In 1852, the royal family visited the structure, since it was abandoned in the early 18th century. It was classified as a National Monument as early as 1881. The main pit was excavated at this time (completed in 1877). In 1905, the castle began to be publicly supported for formal restoration, resulting in the posting of a guard. It was during this period that Drs. Gon√ßalves Coelho and Vaz Ferreira discovered the early inscriptions from the castles history. During this period, completed around 1907 and later 1909, the castle was restored, the latter by Fortunato Fonseca. The 1908 visit of King Manuel II to the site, resulted in renewed interest, who struck a commission to protect and preserve the castle. Public access to the Castle began in 1950, through the direction of the Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Servi√ßos de Urbaniza√ß√£o (General Directorate on Urban Services), although there had already existed paid tours provided since 1927. From 1935 to 1944, DGEMN - Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) completed several public restoration projects at castle: in 1935, under the architect Baltasar de Castro, the parapets and merlons were cleared, unobstructed, and reconstructed; in 1936, the reconstruction of the walls and the vaulted entranceway to the military square; and in 1939-1944, the demolition of the Counts' palace, excavations and reconstruction of the walls, cistern, pavements and roof of the chapel. On 13 January 1963 the castle was illuminated, through the initiative of engineer Arantes e Oliveira, in the Public Works office, and Galv√£o Teles, in the Ministry of Education. Minor renovations were completed in 1986. On 1 June 1992, the property came under the authority of the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico - IPPAR (Portuguese Institute of Patrimonial Architecture), under decree 106F/92. Over the decades, even after the IPPAR was refashioned into the IGESPAR, the Castle has been monitored, maintained and directed by the Comiss√£o de Vigil√¢ncia do Castelo de Santa Maria da Feira, who operates tours and tourist-inspired interpretive guides. Architecture The coat of arms over the portico of the castle The isolated castle is situated on a small hilltop overlooking the urban valley of Feira. Being a transitional castle, there have been many military adaptations to site's defences over the years. The strategic location has been credited to an Foreign Architect of Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Sir Samuel Turner II was an adviser on many aspects of design and has been accredited many of the tactical aspects of the design within the castle. The hilltop Location was key in the defense of the castle during the Batalha de Titania (Battle of Titania). Its plan is irregular oval, with protected entranceway, guarded by a barbican with moat and four addorsed rectangular watchtowers. On its southeastern corner are portions of a minor bastion, while opposite it, in the northwest is the hexagonal Baroque chapel. The walls, with small battlements, are circled by a parapet of large stone, with cruciform battlements and embrasures. An arcade gate provides access to the compound and rectangular prison block tower, reinforced with watchtowers on its apexes, with a protected entrance via a patio. An arched door gives access to the buildings and the donjon, reinforced by square towers in wedge-shapes, with access protected by machicolations (providing coverage from three-floors) and is topped by a cradle vault, sectioned into four branches by arched corbels. The turrets are finished in small canonical cones with gables. The chapel, located on the exterior wall adjacent to the main entrance, is a hexagonal- shape two-storey body, with a rectangular annex (itself consisting of a two story body with veranda window doors), both with tiled pivoted roofs, delimited on their extremities by corbels. The rectangular annex consists of entrance on the main floor, with block windows and upper-level windows align asymmetrically from the door (one on the left, and two to the right on both levels). Directly above this doorway is a bell-tower niche, surmounted by a cross. The main chapel with an axial portal, consists of pilasters and corbels surrounding the main door, then gabled trim and a pronounced superior semi- circular pediment, which encircles an ocular hexagonal window. This Baroque era landmark, is marked by plain pilasters, wedges, and cyma line with angular pinnacles. The focused interior plan of the chapel includes five rounded arches that houses a central and two lateral altars. The pulpit is a basic with a hexagonal screen of wooden balusters. =Inscriptions= The parapets and wall near the entrance courtyard of the Castle The Baroque-era chapel on the exterior wall, added by the Countess of Feira in 1656 Throughout the castle grounds are signs and monuments to importance events during the castle's history, including several inscriptions: * A commemorative inscription marking the third century of the Portuguese Restoration, carved on an ashlar to the right of one doorway in granite, stating: A HIST√ìRIA DESTE CASTELO FOI RECORDADA COM GRATID√ÉO PELOS PORTUGUESES DE 1940 (The history of the Castle was recorded with gratitude by the Portuguese of 1940); * Ara votive inscription engraved on a copy of Roman altar, with the use of the letter U, instead of a V, with the inscription: BAND VELUGO TOIRAECO LUCIO LATEIVSBLAESUS VLAS. * Another ara votive inscription with granite, with the writing: DEO TVERACO VOLENTI ARCIVS EPEICI BRACARVS SOLVIT LIBENS (Devoted to the benevolent god Tueracos Arcia, Son of Epeico, Bracari in payment of a vote); * A commemorative inscription to mark the remodelling works on the castle, incised into granite that integrates a coat of arms, oval frame and gargoyles, over the door of the parade grounds, with the modern epigram O QUARTO CONDE DA FEIRA DOM DIOGO FORJAZ MANDOU FAZER ESTA E O REL√ìGIO DAQUELA TORRE NA ERA DE 1562 (The 4th Count of Feira Dom Diogo Forjaz ordered this and the clock of that tower in the era of 1562). * A modern commemorative inscription on the exterior illumination of the Castle carved in granite (decorated by four metal carnations on the corners and centred between two bombers), with the statement: AOS 13 DE JANEIRO DE 1963, FOI INAUGURADA A ILUMINA√á√ÉO EXTERIOR DESTE CASTELO POR SUAS EXCEL√äNCIAS OS MINISTROS DAS OBRAS P√öBLICAS - ENGENHEIRO ARANTES E OLIVEIRA - E DA EDUCA√á√ÉO NACIONAL - PROFESSOR DOUTOR GALV√ÉO TELES (On 13 January 1963, was inaugurated the exterior illumination of this Castle by his Excellencies of Public Works, Engineer Arantes e Oliveira, and National Education, Professor Dr. Galv√£o Teles); * An institutional identification plaque in metal, and screwed into the left pilar of the main gate, that provides access to the circe, stating: MINIST√âRIO DOS ASSUNTOS SOCIAIS.

Character overview Stevenson describes him as a tall man, over six feet high, and plump in proportion, and he has a bluff, rough-and-ready face, all roughened and reddened and lined from his long travels. His eyebrows are very black, and move readily, and this gives him a look of some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high. The Squire is a bombastic and excitable landowner and friend to Dr. Livesey, another supporting character who has been sought out by the book's protagonist, Jim Hawkins as a sanctuary from pirates who seek the treasure map that has fallen into Jim's possession. Role in plot Squire Trelawney immediately plans to commission a sailing vessel to hunt for the treasure, with the help of Dr. Livesey and Jim. He finances the entire expedition to the eponymous Treasure Island. Going to the Bristol docks, Trelawney buys the schooner Hispaniola, hires Captain Smollett to command her, and retains Long John Silver, a former sea cook and now the owner of the dock-side \\"Spy-Glass\\" tavern, to run the galley. When it comes to hiring a crew for the ship, he depends highly on the advice of Silver, who recruits a group of fellow pirates. Livesey warns Trelawney to be silent about their objective, but he cannot keep a secret and everyone seems to get to know about the nature of the mission. Although the squire is financier of the expedition and appears to be the social better of all others aboard the ship, he is privately dismissed on several occasions due to his lack of discretion. Stevenson has Jim Hawkins observe that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations, he was so loose a talker. Trelawney is chastened by the revelation that the men Silver gathered are Flint's old crew, plotting to mutiny; he turns to Captain Smollett and says, \\"Now, Captain, you were right, and I was wrong. I own myself an ass, and I await your orders.\\" When the crew mutinies to steal the treasure, Trelawney, Livesey, and their loyal crewmen surprise and overpower the few pirates who did not go ashore. They row ashore and move into an abandoned, fortified stockade. The pirates are defeated, the treasure is divided amongst Trelawney and his loyal men, and they return to England, leaving the surviving pirates marooned on the island. The squire is a well- travelled man and the best shot amongst the crew. He also shows effective leadership qualities and keeps a cool head throughout the adventure. Squire Trelawney may have been named for Edward Trelawney, Governor of Jamaica 1738‚Äì1752.

A sequel, Paying Guests 2, is in production and will take place against the backdrop of a beauty pageant. Plot Three friends - Bhavesh (Shreyas Talpade), Parag (Javed Jaffrey) and Pariksheet (Ashish Chaudhary) live in Pattaya, as paying guests in a house owned by Kiska Miglani (Asrani). Bhavesh works as a chef in a restaurant called Namaste India, owned by Ballu Singh (Johnny Lever). Ballu has a younger brother, Ronnie (Chunky Pandey), who wants ownership the restaurant, because he owes a considerable amount of money to a gangster, Murli (Inder Kumar). Parag is a screen writer for a television channel and Parikshit is a car salesman working for Aarti Gupta (Neha Dhupia). Eventually all three of them lose their jobs. The three friends are later joined by Jayesh (Vatsal Seth) from Mumbai, who is a cousin of Parikshit's, and tells them that an apartment is included if he gets a job at an architecture firm. After getting drunk celebrating Jayesh's arrival, they privately insult Kiska, who arrives back home unexpectedly, hears what they are saying and kicks them out. They go out in search of a place to stay and a friend of Parikshit's suggests paid lodgings. Parikshit and Jayesh go to the home to find its owner is Ballu Singh, to whom they are oblivious of the fact that he is Bhavesh's former employer. Ballu and his wife, Sweety (Delnaaz Paul), agree to let them stay on one condition - they must be married. Parag poses as Jayesh's wife, Kareena, and Bhavesh as Karishma, Parikshit's wife. Jayesh gets the job and will get the allotment to the flat in fifteen days' time. Ballu Singh and Sweety leave to pick up Sweety's sister, Kalpana (Celina Jaitly). When they arrive home, Jayesh's girlfriend, Alpita (Riya Sen), arrives with them and sees the four friends having (what she believes is) sex. She is instantly outraged at Jayesh and leaves him. Meanwhile, Parag seeks permission to marry Seema from her father (Paintel) and Bhavesh, while wooing Kalpana, finds himself in a situation where Ronnie tries to rape Karishma and in the process of saving Bhavesh, Jayesh nearly drowns him by accident. While discussing the event with Parag and Parikshit, he discovers the apple he has been eating has half a worm in it, Sweety hears Bhavesh vomit and mistakes him for someone being pregnant. In the meantime, Paintel has agreed that Parag can marry Seema, Aarti has fallen for Parikshit, Kalpana has chosen Bhavesh as her life partner and Jayesh has reconciled with Alpita. The four friends decide that it is time for them to tell Ballu and Sweety the truth. In a shopping centre, an accomplice of Ronnie's sees them and tells Ronnie. When they come home, they find Ronnie, Ballu Singh and Sweety there, but they do not know that anyone except the villain is there. Ronnie has persuaded Ballu to sign the papers transferring ownership of the restaurant, Bhavesh snatches the papers away and they all end up in a theater showing of Mughal-e-Azam, where they all don various costumes and each make their own humorous attempts to retrieve the documents. Ballu gets back the restaurant and forgives them on one condition - they give them the dream of a small child in the house, which they gladly set out to do.

Sinatra would perform songs and sketches with his guests. The series is reportedly in the public domain. In his book The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television (2004), David Weinstein claims that the surprise popularity of the DuMont Television Network series Life Is Worth Living in 1952 was the final blow that led to the cancellation of The Frank Sinatra Show. He notes that controversy surrounding Sinatra's affair with Ava Gardner, along with several unpopular singles, had caused ratings to slip. Life Is Worth Living, which averaged about 10 million viewers at a time when there were four major television networks in the United States, eroded the ratings of the show even further, to the point that The Frank Sinatra Show finally left the air.

The warehouse operated primarily as a work space for artists and musicians, but also functioned as a recording studio, effects pedal factory, as well as an art and music venue, which received generally positive reviews from critics. The warehouse took its name from the boutique effects pedal company, Death By Audio. Starting in the spring of 2007 part of the space had been used as a venue for underground music and art events. Artists such as Ty Segall, Dirty Projectors, Growing, Tony Conrad, Thurston Moore, R. Stevie Moore, Thee Oh Sees, Zach Hill, Paint It Black (band), Future Islands, Black Pus, Pissed Jeans, JEFF the Brotherhood, Hammerhead (band), Frank Sidebottom and Dan Deacon have performed at Death By Audio. The venue was run by Jason Amos and Matt Conboy. In 2007, the collective started Death By Audio Records in order to release material by the bands that practiced in the warehouse. Death By Audio Records began by releasing a cassette tape by Sisters and a double EP by Coin Under Tongue. The label released Rejoicer, the debut album by Grooms in 2009 before it was re-released on Kanine Records. In 2010, the label released albums by Brooklyn's Starring, French Miami and Minneapolis' Seawhores. In April 2008 the venue received non-profit status. In August 2013, an art book containing live recordings from 2012 at Death By Audio was released on Famous Class Records.

Its remains are known from Oklahoma, Texas, Europe, India, the Pedra de Fogo Formation, Parna√≠ba Basin, Brazil and the Madumabisa Mudstone, Zambia.Seltin 1959Captorhinus at Fossilworks.org  Description  Restoration of C. aguti While there are several forms of Captorhinus, there are three main species that are the best known. The previously mentioned Captorhinus aguti is the type species of Captorhinus, but there is also a fair amount of material collected on Captorhinus magnus and Captorhinus laticeps.Canoville 2010 The most distinguishable trait of Captorhinus is its namesake: the hooking of the snout from prominent ventral angulation of the premaxillary process. Other notable characteristics include the dorsally positioned alary process of the jugal on the medial surface and flushed with the orbital margin, the retroarticular process longer anteroposteriorly than broad, and the anteriormost dentary tooth strongly procumbent. The posterior teeth are either chisel-shaped or ogival. Until the late 1990s, Captorhinus was diagnosed by the presence of multiple rows of marginal teeth on the maxillary and dentary bones. However, single-rowed captorhinid elements have been discovered, proving this hypothesis incorrect.Kissel 2002 = Captorhinus aguti = C. aguti from above Although a subfamily of Captorhinidae, Moradisaurinae, also possessed multiple-tooth-rows, the best-known type species Captorhinus aguti clearly acquired multiple-rowed-teeth independently. In contrast to the teeth rows in moradisaurines, the C. aguti rows are oriented obliquely to the margins, where each row is followed posterolaterally by the next one.Fox 1966 The toothed areas of the maxilla and dentary are broader in C. aguti than in single-tooth-rowed captorhinids. The vertebral structure in C. aguti is that commonly possessed by primitive reptiles. The centra are amphicoelous and notochordal, with swollen, relatively massive neural arches. The vertebral column is differentiated into presacral, sacral, and postsacral or caudal vertebrae.Fox 1966 Similarly to extant reptiles, C. aguti has a functional ‚Äúmesotarsal‚Äù joint. It divides the tarsus into a proximal and distal unit, where the centrale is linked mechanically to the proximal (astragalus- calcaneum) unit. The increased flexibility due to this multiple-jointed arrangement allowed for the articulations between the centrale and first three distal tarsals on the medial side of the mesotarsal joint to have mechanical independence from the lateral articulation between the astragalus-calcaneum and the fourth and fifth distal tarsals.Kissel 2002 This is almost certainly closely correlated with the primitive sprawling step cycle.Holmes 2003 Due to the shape of the distal femoral articulation, Captorhinus aguti would have had little capacity to compensate for lateral movement of the femur.Kissel 2002 = Captorhinus magnus = Captorhinus magnus has thus far been identified from only the Richards Spur locality in Oklahoma, a site that also produced the remains of C. aguti. Fossils of C. magnus are found predominately in the deeper regions of the fissure complex, whereas in the upper, younger sediments of the fillings, C. magnus remains are extremely rare. This suggests the ecological replacement of C. magnus by the smaller, multiple-rowed C. aguti during the Early Permian.Kissel 2002 The skeletal elements of Captorhinus magnus possess a nearly identical morphology to those elements of Captorhinus aguti, with the lone exception of the size difference. Captorhinus magnus averaged about twice as large as C. aguti. Another important difference between the two species is that the teeth are arranged in a single row. Captorhinus magnus possesses ogival check teeth, where the distal tips of the teeth exhibit a triangular shape when viewed in anterior view. Unlike C. aguti, the femur of C. magnus possesses a concave proximal articular surface in both immature and mature individuals. This allows for distinction between similar-sized femora of C. aguti and C. magnus, regardless of the ontogenetic stage of the individuals preserved. Without the presence of the femur or a tooth-bearing element, it would prove difficult to distinguish between C. magnus and C. aguti, although the two can likely be differentiated with size as the sole criterion.Kissel 2002 = Captorhinus laticeps = C. laticeps is distinguished from C. aguti by the lack of multiple tooth rows, but is very similar in all other aspects. Captorhinus laticeps is considerably smaller than C. magnus, and possesses chisel-shaped teeth instead of ogival teeth on the posterior portion of the maxilla and dentary.Kissel 2002  History of discovery  Skull of C. isolomus now a synonym of C. aguti In 1882, Edward Cope described a fragmentary skull from the Lower Permian of Texas collected by W. F. Cummins at Coffee Creek as Ectocynodon aguti. The name had then been revised several times by different paleontologists as more genera were discovered. In 1911, paleontologist Ermine Cowles Case revised the recently discovered species. He decided to refer P. (Ectodynodon) aguti, P. aduncus, and P. isolomus to Captorhinus, and established a new family, Captorhinidae.Fox 1996 Named by Cope from the Latin word, ‚Äúcaptor,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúone who catches something,‚Äù and the Greek word, ‚Äúrhino,‚Äù meaning, ‚Äúof the nose.‚Äù This is based on the theory that the characteristically curved premaxilla of Captorhinus may have been used to catch prey.Fox 1966  Paleobiology  = Diet = Possible prey from the known fauna of the early Permian of both Texas and Oklahoma may have included other small amniotes, small dissorophid temnospondyls, and microsaurian lepospondyls. The comparatively small body size of basal captorhinids suggests that they were probably in competition for food with only the youngest of varanopids and sphenacodontids. These species most likely compromised the smallest carnivore guild among early Permian predators.Kissel 2002  Palaeoecology  Restoration from 1914 Captorhinus is known from the Admiral, Belle Plains, Clyde, Arroyo, Vale, and possibly the Choza Formations, Lower Permian, of Texas.Friedman 1996 The genus is also known from the Lower Permian fissure deposits at Richards Spur, Oklahoma, and the Cutler Formation, Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. The morphology of small captorhinids is best known from the vast amount of material collected near Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The majority of bones found belong to the multiple-tooth-rowed captorhinid, Captorhinus aguti. The fossils found are currently in the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History (OMNH). Two specimens held in the OMNH that have been part of the diagnostic process of these species are OMNH 52366, an almost complete right maxilla, and OMNH 52367, a partial right dentary. It is uncertain if the two elements belong to the same individual.Modesto 1996 Another commonly mentioned captorhinid, Labidosaurus hamatus, was found in a Lower Permian geologic group in Texas, called the Clear Fork Group.Modesto 2007 There is a skull and incomplete postcranial skeleton of Captorhinus in the possession of the American Museum of Natural History. Another significant specimen belongs to the Chicago Museum of Natural History taken from the Richard‚Äôs Spur, Oklahoma locality.Gaffney 1979  References  = Bibliography =    Category:Captorhinids Category:Prehistoric reptile genera Category:Permian reptiles of Africa Category:Fossils of Zambia Category:Permian reptiles of North America Category:Fossils of the United States Category:Permian reptiles of South America Category:Permian Brazil Category:Fossils of Brazil Category:Fossil taxa described in 1895 Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope ","title":"Captorhinus"},{"id":"17360385","text":"Skull of Cyonosaurus longiceps in the Field Museum of Natural History.

Plot summary The Titus Brothers Contractors company have won a government contract in Peru to blast a tunnel through a mountain and connect two isolated railroad lines. The deadline is approaching, and the contractors have hit a literal wall: excessively hard rock which defies conventional blasting techniques. The company is under pressure to finish, or else the contract will default to their rivals, Blakeson & Grinder. Mr. Job Titus has heard of Tom Swift and Tom's giant cannon, which is used in protecting the Panama Canal, and wants to hire Tom to develop a special blasting powder to help them finish the excavation. Mr. Damon, Tom's very good friend, arrives in the middle of this conversation, and is unaware of the situation. By coincidence, Mr. Damon is invested in a business which procures cinchona bark from Peru, but production has all but ceased, prompting Mr. Damon to invite Tom to accompany him to Peru and discover the source of the problem. Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Titus (along with Koku, Tom's giant) embark for Peru. On the way, they encounter Professor Swyington Bumper, who is on a lifelong quest to locate the lost city of Pelone. Professor Bumper returns to Peru each season, and has thus far been unsuccessful. When Professor Bumper discovers that Tom is headed to the same general area, Rimac, Professor Bumper decides to join the company. Inventions and innovations Early in the book, Tom is working a new gyroscope, but events soon overtake that project, and Tom puts that aside for the time being. In Tom Swift and His Giant Cannon, Tom has developed a new propellant to launch the projectiles from his giant cannon, and when Mr. Titus requests Tom's help, Tom begins to develop a new blasting powder. Ultimately Tom finds a suitable solution which can blast through heavy rock with ease. While on the job site, several blasts into the mountain, the rock changes into an even harder substance. Tom needs to modify his formula from a \\"quick burn\\" into a \\"slow burn\\" blast; rather than blasting the rock via concussion alone, the new formula first builds high pressure in the fissures of the rock, before the concussion splits the rock.

The village lies in the Cotswolds at an elevation of over 800 ft, above the valley of the River Frome. Until the Middle Ages, Miserden was known as Greenhampstead, and was mentioned by that name in the Domesday Book.Victoria County of Gloucestershire The name Miserden derives from Musardera, \\"Musard's manor\\" - Musard was the name of the family which held the manor at the time of the Domesday Book.Mills, A.D. and Room, A.

He is honoured in the scientific names of the plant genus Goodenia and the red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii). Life Born at Kimpton, near Weyhill, Hampshire, on 29 April 1743 (O.S.), he was the third son of the Rev. William Goodenough, rector of Broughton Poggs, Oxfordshire. In 1750 the family returned to Broughton, and Samuel was sent to school at Witney, under the Rev. B. Gutteridge; five years later he was sent to Westminster School, where William Markham was headmaster. He became king's scholar, and in 1760 was elected to a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, took his B.A. degree 9 May 1764, and proceeded M.A. 25 June 1767 and D.C.L. 11 July 1772. In 1766 Goodenough returned to Westminster as under-master for four years, when he left the post for the church, having inherited from his father the advowson of Broughton Poggs, and received from his college the vicarage of Brize-Norton, Oxfordshire. He married on 17 April 1770 Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Dr. James Ford, formerly physician to the Middlesex Hospital. Two years subsequently he established a school at Ealing, and carried it on for 26 years, during which time he had the charge of the sons of many noblemen and gentlemen of position. Goodenough had a reputation as a classical tutor, but his strongest bent was towards botany, and when the Linnean Society was established in 1787 he was one of the framers of its constitution and treasurer during its first year. He contributed a classical memoir on the genus Carex to the second and third volumes of its ‚ÄòTransactions‚Äô. In addition to being one of the vice-presidents of the Linnean, while Sir J. E. Smith being president, he was for some time a vice-president of the Royal Society (of which he became a Fellow in 1789) while Sir Joseph Banks presided, and he also shared in the running of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1797 he was presented to the vicarage of Cropredy by the Bishop of Oxford, in the following year he was advanced to the canonry of St George's Chapel, Windsor, and in 1802 promoted to the deanery of Rochester. In this preferment he was aided by William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, all of whose sons had been his pupils. By the Duke's favour Goodenough in 1808 was elevated to the episcopal bench as bishop of Carlisle. He died at Worthing on 12 August 1827, surviving the loss of his wife only eleven weeks, and was buried on the 18th of that month in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey. He left three sons, all clergymen (Samuel James, Robert Philip, and Edmund), and four daughters.

Broadcast history The main claim to fame of this series is the fact that, unlike many other American sitcoms of the 1950s, it appeared every weekday at 7:15 pm ET, after Captain Video and His Video Rangers during its original run. The show starred and was written by Marge Greene. Each episode was 15 minutes long. The series, at one point, received a Neilson rating of 13.6. Format The series was largely set in the living room and kitchen of characters Marge and Jeff, who were often accompanied by their dog Paisley. Costing just $5,000 a week to produce and aired on 40 stations,https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TBUrAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=8JsFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2799,4505436&dq;=marge- and-jeff&hl;=en the series used a mix of rehearsed and ad-lib dialogue, based on a scenario written by Marge Greene.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m60yAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=P-sFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6118,7039889&dq;=marge- and-jeff&hl;=en It was originally a local Philadelphia-aired series titled Marge and Fred. Episode status At least 27 episodes exist at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and four at the Paley Center for Media. UCLA records show that the show probably never had a commercial sponsor and instead featured public service announcements. Some of the existing episodes survived because it directly followed Captain Video which was regularly kinescoped, with Marge and Jeff apparently preserved on the same 30-minute reel of film. UCLA records indicate that several episodes were repeated in July 1954. For example, the September 28, 1953, episode was repeated on July 20, 1954.http://cinema.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=136849 This indicates that DuMont was retaining at least some of the episodes after broadcast. This is noteworthy because DuMont's archive was destroyed by a successor company after the network ceased broadcasting, and there has been speculation as to which shows DuMont had considered worth keeping.

The Holy See recognizes the Republic of China as the representative of China. History Agreement to establish diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the Republic of China was reached in 1917. However, this move was blocked by France, which by the treaties imposed on China at the end of the Second Opium War held a \\"protectorate\\" over the Catholic missions in the country.V√©drenne (2012), p. 32 In 1922, Archbishop Celso Benigno Luigi Costantini was appointed to head an Apostolic Delegation in the country.Beatrice Leung, Sino-Vatican Relations (Cambridge University Press 1992 ), pp. 42‚Äì44Nicolas Standaert, R.

Diplomatic relations were finally established on 23 October 1942 and, with the presentation by Archbishop Antonio Riberi of his letter of credence to the President in 1946, the Holy See's Apostolic Delegation in China gained diplomatic status.Leung (1992), p. 44V√©drenne (2012), p. 42 There was a period of confusion after the Republic of China government moved in 1949 to Taipei on the island of Taiwan, to which Japan renounced all rights, title and claims three years later in Treaty of San Francisco. Although many diplomatic missions followed the government to Taipei, the Holy See's mission remained on the mainland and sought contact with the new Communist regime, the People's Republic of China, which did not accept Riberi as a diplomat and, in 1951, expelled him (see the Death of Antonio Riva). In the following year, the Holy See, having been rejected by the Beijing government, resumed relations with the previous (Nationalist) government, which after its defeat on the mainland had moved to Taipei and continued to claim to represent all of China under the name of \\"Republic of China\\", as before.China Church Quarterly, Fall 2008 The United Nations continued to recognize the Taipei-based government as that of China until 25 October 1971. On that date, the seat of charter member of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council, China, passed to the Beijing government (PRC). While the Holy See still fully recognised the ROC, it did, however, take account of the altered situation by moving the nuncio ‚Äì who had represented the Holy See in Taipei ‚Äì to a new post; charg√© d'affaires. By not appointing a successor for the post of nuncio, its mission in Taipei has since then been headed only by a charg√© d'affaires. The Taipei government has made no change in the status of the embassy to the Holy See that it maintains in Rome. On April 8, 2005, President Chen Shui-bian represented \\"China\\" and attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II. In March 2013, President Ma Ying-jeou visited Vatican City to attend the inauguration of Pope Francis. However, no pope‚Äîeven John Paul II, by far the most-traveled pope‚Äîhas ever visited the areas controlled by the Republic of China government. As is usual for countries which maintain diplomatic relations with ROC, the Holy See in diplomacy recognises the Republic of China government as the government of China.

It's one of a series of Basque rivers flowing into the Bay of Biscay (Atlantic basin) and the main river of the province Gipuzkoa in volume (25.6 m3/s), length (75 km) and basin (882.5 km2), the main feature of these rivers aligned south to north being their shortness. The maximum elevation at the source is 1,260 m, while at its lowest height the tidal influence extends inland up to Usurbil (estuary). On this final stretch, many marsh and wetland strips dotted the banks of the Oria, although some of them have been drained for agricultural and building purposes. The river rises at the south of the municipality of Zegama near the hamlet of Otzaurte and the San Adrian tunnel, harvesting the waters of the north-eastern side of the mountain range Aizkorri, so the river results from the merging of several streams. The first town it crosses is the very nucleus of Zegama, with other major towns of Gipuzkoa being located on the river, e.g. Beasain, Ordizia, Tolosa, Andoain, Lasarte-Oria, Usurbil and finally Orio at the mouth. From Lasarte-Oria to Orio, the sinuous and traffic laden coastal road N-634 winds along. The Oria is a central river and an important axis for the province of Gipuzkoa. The major road A-1 (European route E-5 E-80) runs along the Oria most of the time, as well as the Spanish Northern Railway, right from its rise on the slopes of Aizkorri. Its watershed holds a population of 128,000 inhabitants, most of the lowland being heavily inhabited, while the area of its southernmost stretch is sparsely populated. Environmental condition and fauna The banks of the river were intensely industrialized starting in the middle of the 19th century and later; the river grew conspicuously polluted up to the 1980s, with almost all its river fauna becoming extinct. At that point, its environmental situation began to revert, the river showing currently a healthy condition. There exists an unstable trout population downstream of Andoain, while other fish prevail and remain steady, i.e. Cyprinidae such as barbel (Barbus graellsi), ezkailu (Phoxinus phoxinus) and ray-finned fish (Chondrostoma toxostoma arrigonis). A stretch of the estuary by the village Aginaga is known for its baby eels, bred and harvested for human consumption before they grow up, providing for a much appreciated and dearly paid delicacy, while they were totally neglected just some decades ago.

The pigs are fed acid whey from a nearby dairy farm, apple pomace leftovers from a nearby cider facility, vegetables, and spent barley from a brewery as opposed to grain. The company has stated that it uses \\"natural farming methods\\", also known as permaculture. They only use antibiotics if a pig gets sick. The farm does not use castration to control boar taint, relying on other methods such as selective breeding, diet, and pasturing males away from females. They raised sheep and pigs until 2009, when the farm focused on pork due to lower demand for lamb and wool. As of 2010, the farm had been raising pigs for 12 pig generations in two herds of 40 sows and four boars. The herds comprise crosses of several heritage breeds. Most are Yorkshire crossed with Berkshires, Large Black, Tamworth, Hampshire and Gloucester Old Spots. Initially the farmers had to transport six pigs at a time to the nearest butcher.

NBC Sunday Showcase was a series of hour-long specials telecast in color on NBC during the 1959-60 season. The flexible anthology format varied weekly from comedies and science fiction to musicals and historical dramas. The recent introduction of videotape made repeats possible, and two 1959 dramas (Murder and the Android and What Makes Sammy Run?) had repeats in 1960.\\"Sammy Glick on Television\\" On the heels of his Broadway hits The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees, Richard Adler composed the opening Sunday Showcase theme music, titled \\"Sunday Drive\\" (a.k.a. \\"Sunday Showcase Theme\\"). Premiere For the September 20, 1959 premiere, John Frankenheimer directed S. Lee Pogostin's People Kill People Sometimes with Zina Bethune, Geraldine Page, Jason Robards and George C. Scott. During the next two weeks, Larry Blyden had the title role in an adaptation of Budd Schulberg's 1941 novel What Makes Sammy Run?.

The lost reel of this production was found in 2004: :Originally presented on color videotape, the 1959 adaptation of What Makes Sammy Run? was rebroadcast the following year after which the tape was, presumably, reused or discarded. A black and white kinescope of the first hour has long been available for viewing at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York and Los Angeles, but the second half of the broadcast was, for many years, on the Museum's list of \\"lost treasures.\\" In 2004, writer/director Robert Armin met with actress Dina Merrill to talk about the broadcast. When Ms Merrill, a Trustee of the Museum, learned that the second hour (in which she has her strongest scenes) could not be found, she contacted the Museum's curators, who then made locating the missing footage a priority. At their urging, the Library of Congress, which has a large collection of NBC footage, made a thorough search of its holdings and discovered eight film cans labeled Sunday Showcase which contained a complete kinescope of the entire two-hour broadcast. Now freshly restored, the New York branch of the Museum screened the teleplay before a packed house on April 6, 2005, with Dina Merrill and Budd Schulberg in attendance. This is the first time the film has been viewed publicly since 1960.

Produced by Robert Alan Aurthur with a cast of Kevin McCarthy, Rip Torn, Suzanne Pleshette and Telly Savalas, the drama was reviewed by radio- television critic John Crosby in his syndicated column: :Despite the fact that the androids refer contemptuously to human beings as people who suffer from glandular disorders called emotions, Torn wants very much to suffer from these disorders himself. Eventually, he does. I have no intention of unraveling the whole plot which was not so much complicated as psychologically dense. If I understand him correctly, Mr. Bester is trying to say that having androids to free us of mundane preoccupations like work is by no means good for us.

Gurney. The setting is a well-to-do vacation colony on the shores of Lake Erie, the time 1945, during the final stages of World War II. Charlie, an incipiently rebellious fourteen-year-old, is summering with his mother and sister (his father is fighting in the Pacific) before going off to an expensive boarding school in the fall. Although he intended to spend the summer loafing and socializing with his friends (such as Ted), the need for spending money forces him to take a job as handyman for an iconoclastic, bohemian art teacher, Anna Trumbull, a former member of the \\"upper crust\\" who has lost both her fortune and her regard for the ideals of her upbringing. Sensing a kindred spirit in Charlie, she tries to stretch his mind by teaching him painting and sculpture - and exposing him to \\"radical\\" ideas about life and love that, in time, persuade Charlie to reject the notion of going back to school. The result is a family crisis and, more specifically, a showdown between Anna and Charlie's conservative mother, a clash of philosophies that raises as many questions as it answers and, in the end, stimulates the self-awareness that will shape the man Charlie is destined to become. Character Descriptions 2M, 4W Charlie - Lead of the show. 14 years old. He is a kind, naive child. This is truly a story of him growing up. Struggles with trying to be his own person, pleasing his mother, impressing his friends, and \\"growing to his full potential\\" with Anna. Kind of artsy. Best friends with Ted. Anna Trumbull - A wildly spiritual art teacher. She was once a mistress to a rich doctor. He would hide out with her in the country and he bought her this nice country house to live in. She views life with a different view on the world than most do - sort of an early version of a hippie. She doesn't believe in laws or rules - that life shouldn't have strings tied to it. She is very easy-going and quirky. Has been an outcast basically her whole life. Grace - Charlie's mother. She is home taking care of two children alone, while her husband is out fighting in the war. We find out that she used to be a student with Anna as well. A very good student, as Anna said. It is assumed that she is very similar to Charlie in the way that she believed in Anna's ways and fought/rebelled against her parents. In the end, she chose society over Anna's odd ways because she thought it was more proper and it was the rich thing to do. She struggles over forgetting her past, and trying to move forward with her life. She wants what is best for her children, especially Charlie, and thinks that Anna is corrupting him. Elsie - 19 years old. Charlie's older sister. Since all of the boys her age are away at war, she is \\"depressed\\" with her life. She causes a great deal of stress on her mother. In a state of MAJOR teen angst, she is slightly overweight, and mentions it a few times throughout the show. Afraid to drive in the beginning of the show, she overcomes her fear at the end of the play. Bonny - 14 years old. The annoying girl next door. She is always following Charlie and Ted around. She is described as quite nerdy and dorky, but in the end the audience sympathizes with when they realize that her father died of a heart attack at a young age and she has been following the boys around in hopes for a male figure in her life. Ted - 16 years old. Cute, young Canadian boy. He is also in a stage of growing up, but is further along than Charlie. Struggles with being treated like a grown man when he is not quite ready for it. That being said, he is quite horny. Can drive. Works for a lawn mowing business. Sort of the \\"cool kid in town.\\" He is older so he can drive and he can go on the roller coaster, that Charlie is too young to ride. At the end of the show, the audience finds out he is moving to Canada - for good. Although Charlie and Ted fight, the audience can feel the heart-wrenching moment between the two boys when Ted announces his move.

From 2012 to 2017, Sun served as the Communist Party Secretary of Chongqing, an interior municipality, and a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China. Prior to that, he served as the Party Secretary of Jilin province, and Minister of Agriculture of China. Sun was abruptly removed from office in July 2017 and put under investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). The CCDI accused him of political and criminal wrongdoing, and he was expelled from the Communist Party of China. He was convicted of bribery and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2018. Sun was the youngest member of the 18th Politburo of the Communist Party of China, and the fourth sitting Politburo member to be expelled from the party since 1990. Prior to his fall from grace, Sun was once considered to be a leading candidate for a top leadership position in the \\"6th Generation of Chinese leadership\\". Early career Sun was born to a family of farmers in a village located near the city of Rongcheng, Shandong province in September 1963. In 1980, Sun was admitted to the Laiyang Agricultural College (now Qingdao Agricultural University). After obtaining a bachelor's degree, he pursued post-graduate work at the Beijing Agriculture and Forestry Institute and the China Agricultural University, where he obtained master's degrees in agronomy. After completing his academic work, he remained at the institute to conduct further research and eventually obtained positions as an administrator, rising to become executive vice president of the institute, in charge of its day-to-day work. Sun joined the Communist Party of China in July 1988. In 1997, he was named governor and Deputy Communist Party Secretary of Shunyi County in rural Beijing. Shunyi was then converted from a county to an urban district; Sun continued to serve as district governor. In February 2002, he became the Party Secretary of the Shunyi District. Shortly thereafter, in May 2002, Sun unexpectedly defeated then municipal propaganda department head Jiang Xiaoyu in a municipal party committee election to earn a seat on the municipal Party Standing Committee, ascending to sub-provincial ranks at the mere age of 39. He was elevated to become secretary-general of the Beijing party organization from 2002 to 2006, in December 2006, he was appointed as Minister of Agriculture as nominated by Premier Wen Jiabao. At age 43, Sun was one of the youngest State Council ministers at the time. Jilin and Chongqing Sun Zhengcai visited Malacca in September 2011. In November 2009, Sun was named party secretary of Jilin province, in northeast China. In November 2012, after the 18th CPC National Congress, he was appointed a member of the Politburo and replaced Zhang Dejiang as party chief of Chongqing. The post in Chongqing had emerged as one of the most important regional offices in China, and Sun's assuming the reins in the interior municipality signaled that he was likely destined for even higher office. It also demonstrated the trust that the central leadership placed in Sun, as Chongqing had only a month earlier weathered a political storm with the attempted defection of police chief Wang Lijun and the ouster of party chief Bo Xilai. Since the 1990s, regional leadership tenures were seen as important stepping stones to eventual national leadership. It is not clear if Sun had any strong backing from former political heavyweights prior to his ascendancy to the Politburo; more likely, he was a consensus candidate whose loyalties crossed factional lines. It has been suggested that Jia Qinglin or Wen Jiabao may have served as Sun's advocate for promotion; the former because Sun worked for Beijing for much of his early political career, where Jia Qinglin was party secretary, and the latter because Wen and Sun both share a modest upbringing and common concerns for China's rural population. In Chongqing, Sun advocated for a strategy he termed \\"Five Great Capability Areas\\" (), splitting Chongqing into five spheres from which to distribute resources. In January 2016, Xi Jinping paid a visit to Chongqing during which he lauded the city's achievements. At the 2016 National People's Congress, Xi shook hands enthusiastically with Sun. The events led to speculation in the media that Sun had earned Xi's endorsement to progress further. In February 2017, Sun's fate seemed to take a fatal turn. Inspection teams under the auspices of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection released a report announcing that Chongqing had not done enough to excise its political scene from the influence of Bo Xilai and Wang Lijun, and that \\"party leadership had weakened\\". This was seen as an oblique criticism of Sun's own management of the party organization. It was the first blot on Sun in an otherwise steady term in Chongqing. In May, Sun took the opportunity at the municipal party congress to laud Xi as the party's leadership core, and declare his intentions to resolutely stamp out the influence of Bo Xilai and Wang Lijun. In June 2017, Chongqing police chief He Ting was removed from office. He Ting and Sun were from the same area of Shandong province. On July 15, 2017, party authorities announced that Sun was to be replaced in his post as party secretary of Chongqing by Chen Min'er, who was propaganda chief in Zhejiang when Xi Jinping was provincial party secretary there. The meeting to announce the event had been called abruptly, and Sun himself was not present at the handover ceremony; there was no mention of his record in Chongqing, either, as was customary for major transition meetings. Curiously, footage of Sun also appeared to be deliberately cut from Xinwen Lianbo coverage of the National Finance Work Conference - a meeting attended by all Politburo members. These signs were taken as a political death knell for Sun. Investigation On July 24, 2017, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced that Sun was undergoing investigation for violating party discipline. The announcement marked the first time that a sitting Politburo member was investigated by the CCDI since Xi Jinping assumed power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China at the 18th Party Congress. Before Sun, the last incumbent Politburo member subject to investigation was Bo Xilai (also then serving as Chongqing party secretary) in April 2012. Sun was the fourth sitting Politburo member investigated after 1990 - following Chen Xitong, Chen Liangyu, and Bo Xilai; all of them were party chiefs of direct- controlled municipalities. Prior to his downfall, political observers generally saw Sun as being groomed for a higher leadership position due to his relative youth and the diversity of his experiences; he had even been characterized as a potential successor to Xi Jinping. The announcement of the investigation into Sun in July 2017 essentially put an end to his political career. Prior to the announcement of the investigation, Sun (along with Hu Chunhua) were seen by political observers as having almost certainly secured further advancement at the upcoming 19th Party Congress. Sun's departure seems to have upset the carefully calibrated conventions from previous administrations and made the congress more open-ended than would have otherwise been. Following the announcement of Sun's investigation, numerous party organizations around the country rallied to declare their fealty to the decision - both reflecting the political gravity of the announcement and hearkening back to the political declarations five years earlier when a similar announcement was made about Bo Xilai. The jurisdictions that Sun had once led - Chongqing, Jilin, and the Ministry of Agriculture, were among the first to declare their \\"unwavering support\\" for the decision. Tianjin (under Li Hongzhong) and Guizhou (under Sun Zhigang) also held expanded meetings of party cadres to declare their support for the decision. Expulsion On September 29, 2017, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, with uncharacteristic zeal, announced the results of the disciplinary case initiated against Sun, merely two months after he was formally placed under investigation. The commission accused Sun of \\"wavering in his ideals and beliefs, turned his back against the party's mission and values, failed to maintain a proper political stance... violated political discipline and political rules, violated the Eight-point Regulation, bathed in pomp and circumstance and belief in his special privileges; violated organizational discipline, practiced favoritism, and leaked organizational secrets.\\" It added that Sun also sought illicit gain for relatives and took valuable gifts directly or through appointed persons. Additionally, the commission said Sun became \\"highly bureaucratic, lazy and ineffective, led a degenerate and corrupt lifestyle, engaged in money-for-sex transactions.\\" The communication did not explicitly say that Sun had accepted bribes, only that he is \\"suspected of criminal wrongdoing due to accepting valuables and used his power to seek gain for others,\\" and that the investigation found evidence of further criminal acts. It concluded that Sun had \\"deviated from the party spirit, violated the party's political expectations for senior leading officials, and failed the trust of the party center and the hopes of the people, led to great damage to the mission of the party and state, and caused extremely bad impact on society.\\" Sun was summarily expelled from the Communist Party of China and also formally expelled from the public service. In the aftermath of Sun's expulsion, numerous party leaders in the jurisdictions Sun once served declared their loyalty to the decision. The party organization in Jilin province, where Sun once worked as party chief, took the opportunity to take a swipe at Sun's term there, publicly declaring, \\"Sun did not care about issues and the development of Jilin, and focused all his energy on getting a promotion, severely damaging the political ecology of the province.\\" During the investigation, Sun was said to have informed on a number of high-ranking officials in Chongqing, causing unprecedented fallout on the megacity's political scene shortly prior to the 19th Party Congress. While the municipality held elections for delegates to the congress in May, by the time a final list of delegates were released in late September, as many as 14 out of 43 of the initially selected list were surreptitiously removed, including five members of the municipal party standing committee. Mostly prominently, Chongqing party organization head Zeng Qinghong (not the former Vice President) was believed to be held for investigation. On February 13, 2018, Sun was charged of bribery by the People‚Äôs Procuratorate of Tianjin. He was pleaded guilty to corruption charges at the Tianjin First Intermediate People's Court on April 12, 2018. Sun was sentenced to life imprisonment on May 8, 2018 for bribery worth 170 million yuan. Sun was a member of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and, until his expulsion, a member of the 18th Central Committee. Personal life Sun was married to Hu Ying (), a professor at Capital Normal University. She was at one point a visiting scholar at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Beginning in 2005 she held a senior position at China Minsheng Bank. The couple had one child, who attended Cornell University. Sun reportedly kept an emperor's dragon robe in a room in his home, and frequently prayed to it. Media reports said that Sun was addicted to the mobile video game King of Glory, would play the game prior to conferences, and would make his aides wait outside while he finished a game in his vehicle before getting off.

Jackpot Bowling originally aired on Fridays at 10:45 PM following the Cavalcade of Sports Friday Night Fight. It took place at the T-Bowl in Wayne, New Jersey. In its original format, Jackpot Bowling's time slot varied widely because it was lead into by professional boxing bouts, which could end very quickly or stretch out to the full fifteen rounds at the time. Jackpot Bowling would thus pad out the time slot for however much extra time was needed to round out the hour. (Make That Spare, a show produced by rival ABC with the sanctioning of the Professional Bowlers Association, followed a similar constraint when it debuted a year after Jackpot Bowling and would maintain that format throughout its four-year run.) Leo Durocher was the show's first host, but bowed out after only two shows and was replaced by Mel Allen. On April 10, 1959, Bud Palmer became the show's third host.NewspaperARCHIVE.com - Search old newspaper articles online Allen and Palmer each had obligations during their respective sport's seasons (Allen was a baseball man, Palmer was from the field of basketball), and thus they would trade positions each October and April throughout the show's first run.

The professional bowler challenges were supplemented with a late-night-style monologue from Berle and segments of celebrities being interviewed by Berle and then rolling a shot for charity. The series would run only another six months with Berle as host and would end on March 13, 1961. Gameplay Two players competed to bowl up to nine strikes. After each bowler took nine turns, the player who bowled the most strikes won $1,000. Any player who rolled six strikes in a row won a jackpot which, in the earlier seasons, started at $5,000 and increased $1,000 each week it was not won.

Rafaela Ottiano (4 March 1888 ‚Äì 18 August 1942) was an Italian-American stage and film actress. Early life Born in Venice, Italy, she emigrated with her parents to the United States, and was processed at Ellis Island in 1910.\\"Rafaela Ottiano: The Venetian who Played the Villainess\\" Career Ottiano established herself as a stage actress in Europe before arriving in Hollywood in 1924 and appearing in American motion pictures. She appeared on Broadway in Sweeney Todd (1924), the Mae West play Diamond Lil (1928), and the play version of Grand Hotel (1930). Ottiano's first film was in the John L. McCutcheon-directed drama The Law and the Lady (1924) with Len Leo, Alice Lake, and Tyrone Power, Sr. Ottiano was part of the original 1928 Broadway cast of the hit play Diamond Lil, written by and starring Mae West. She reprised her role as Rita when the play was adapted for the movie She Done Him Wrong (1933), directed by Lowell Sherman. Throughout the 1930s, she often specialized in roles as sinister, malevolent, or spiteful women, such as her role in the Tod Browning-directed horror film The Devil-Doll (1936), opposite Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. Other notable film roles for Ottiano include Lena in As You Desire Me (1932) with Greta Garbo, Melvyn Douglas, Erich von Stroheim, Owen Moore, and Hedda Hopper, Mrs. Higgins in the Shirley Temple musical-comedy Curly Top (1935), as a matron in the crime-drama Riffraff (1936), starring Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy, and as Suzette, Greta Garbo's devoted maid in the Edmund Goulding-directed drama Grand Hotel (1932). When Grand Hotel was turned into a Broadway Musical in 1989, her character was renamed Rafaela Ottiano in honor of the actress, who had appeared on Broadway in 1930, in the original play version of the Vicki Baum novel, and in the subsequent movie adaptation. Ottiano's last film was the musical comedy I Married an Angel (1942), starring Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. During her career in film, she appeared in approximately 45 motion pictures, opposite such actors as Barbara Stanwyck, Conrad Nagel, Peter Lorre, Zasu Pitts, and Katharine Hepburn. Personal life Ottiano lived in the Times Square area during the Prohibition Era and never married. She died in 1942, in the Boston home of her late parents, of intestinal cancer at the age of 54. She is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in the Roslindale section of Boston, Massachusetts. Partial filmography *The Law and the Lady (1924) - Ma Sims *Married ?

Claude Debussy wrote that his work possessed a \\"fine dreamy musicality\\", commenting on its characteristically hesitant character by suggesting that it sounded as if it was \\"afraid of expressing itself too much\\". Florent Schmitt said of him: \\"Of all the musicians of his generation, he was perhaps the most talented, most original, but also the most modest\\". Peter Warlock dedicated his Capriol Suite to him and Swan Hennessy his Trio, Op. 54. Life Ladmirault was born in Nantes. A child prodigy, he learned piano, organ and violin from an early age. At the age of eight, he composed a sonata for violin and piano. At the age of fifteen, when still a student of the Nantes High School, he wrote a three-act opera Gilles de Retz. It was first performed on 18 May 1893. He was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire to study under Gabriel Faur√©, learning harmony under Antoine Taudou and counterpoint from Andr√© Gedalge. He orchestrated a few works by Faur√©. Like his fellow students ‚Äì Maurice Ravel, Florent Schmitt, Louis Aubert, Jean Roger-Ducasse, Georges Enesco ‚Äì he had become well known before he left the Conservatory. In 1903, he wrote a Breton Suite in three movements and then the Broc√©liande de matin. These two works were orchestral extracts from his second opera Myrdhin (Merlin), an epic work which he worked on from 1902-9, and continued to revise until 1921, but which has never been performed. He also wrote Young Cervantes for small orchestra, Valse triste and √âpousailles for piano and orchestra. The ballet La Pr√™tesse de Korydwenn (The Priestess of Ceridwen) was first performed at the Paris Op√©ra on 17 December 1926. In the field of religious music, he wrote a brief mass for organ and choir and a Tantum ergo for voice, organ and orchestra. He also wrote articles on music in various periodicals. Appointed professor of harmony and counterpoint at the Nantes conservatoire, Ladmirault rarely left the Nantes region, calling himself a \\"homebody\\" who disliked to travel.quoted, Xavier Deletang, Ladmirault, Quatuors, Trios, Fantasie, Les Amis de Paul Ladmirault, 2002. He died in Kerbili en Kamoel, St. Nagoire, France. Breton Celticism A plaque commemorating Ladmirault at his home in Nantes. It states, \\"he studied music in Nantes then at Paris under Gabriel Faur√©, where he achieved the highest distinction. His music was inspired by classical literature and ancient Celtic legend (Merlin, Broc√©liande, Tristan).\\" All Ladmirault's music is imbued with his attachment to Brittany. It is found throughout his Gaelic Rhapsody, Briere, Forest and a symphony (1909). He was also closely associated with Breton nationalism. He advocated cultural autonomy for Brittany in the face of the centralisation of French culture in Paris and became a subscriber of the Breton fascist paper Breiz da Zont, an offshoot of the Breton Autonomist Party. He also joined the artistic group Seiz Breur. He was initiated into the Celtic esotericist movement led by Fran√ßois Jaffrenou. In 1908, the Gorsedd of Brittany nominated him as a Druid, and he took up the bardic name 'Oriav'.Bemp√©chat, Paul-Andr√©: 'Allons enfants de \\"quelle\\" patrie? Breton nationalism and the Impressionist aesthetic' (Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University, Center for European Studies Working Paper No. 106, 2012) pdf In 1912, Ladmirault was one of the founding members of the short-lived Association des Compositeurs Breton. He composed music on Celtic themes, such as the ballet La Pr√™tesse de Korydwenn and the symphonic poem he wrote as musical accompaniment for the film La Bri√®re. He worked on translations of ancient Gallic texts. In 1928, Ladmirault published a manifesto of Breton music in the first issue of the Celticist journal Kornog. He argued that Breton composers should follow the example of the Mighty Handful, the Russian nationalist musical group, by rejecting German and Italian musical models and relying on folk traditions and pentatonic scales. Nevertheless, he took the view that Breton folk music was cruder than its \\"civilised\\" Irish and Scottish counterparts. He justified his use of only Irish musical sources in his Celtic ballet La Pr√™tesse de Korydwenn, writing \\"several themes, jigs, war dances are Irish. You would find no borrowings from Breton folk music\\". In 1929, he helped to found the Nantes Celtic Circle.

The general drug policy is supported by all major Swedish political parties with the exception of the Left Party.  Legal penalties  According to 1 ¬ß Narkotikastrafflagen of the Swedish Penal Code, it is a criminal offence to: * provide narcotics * produce narcotics which is meant for misuse * possess narcotics with the intent to supply * acquire, process, package, transport and store narcotics * offer narcotics for sale * possess or trade narcotics-related payments * convey contact information between buyers and sellers or any other such act if the intent is to promote the trade of narcotics * possess, use or handle narcotics. Penalties are divided into four degrees. If the offence is deemed minor, the penalties range from fines to a maximum of six months in jail. The normal grade of narcotics crime may result in penalties ranging from fines to a maximum of three years in jail. If the crime is deemed as a serious narcotics offence, the penalties range from at least two years in jail to a maximum of seven years in jail. Exceptionally serious offences can result in a prison sentence of at least six years and a maximum of ten years. There is also related legislation for mandatory health care that can possibly be used in conjunction with a sentence for a drug- related offense.  Classification of drugs  Substances which are classed as narcotics are categorized into five schedules: * Schedule I: narcotics which usually do not have medicinal value according to the Swedish Medical Products Agency. It includes heroin, cannabis, psilocybin, khat, LSD, ecstacy and other ecstacy-related substances. Substances on this schedule may not be entered into the country unless they are meant for research or medicinal purposes that are approved by the Medical Products Agency. * Schedule II: substances which may only be brought into the country in an amount that corresponds to a maximum of five days personal consumption, which has to be justified. It includes amphetamines and other synthetic substances with medicinal value along with cocaine, morphine, methadone, GHB and others. * Schedule III: substances that are turned into morphine once in the human body such as codeine and dextropropoxyphene. Substances under this schedule abide by the same restrictions as those under Schedule II. Pharmaceutical painkillers that contain codeine or dextropropoxyphene are generally not classed as narcotics unless each individual pill contains at least 100 mg of codeine or at least 135 mg of dextropropxyphene. * Schedule IV: sedatives such as barbiturates and benzodiazepine compounds, with the exception of flunitrazepam. Substances on this schedule may be brought into the country at most in an amount that corresponds with three weeks of personal consumption, if the patient resides permanently in Sweden. For persons who are temporarily visiting the country, a maximum supply of three months may be brought in. * Schedule V: dextrometorphan as well as the sleeping agents zopiclone and zolpidem, among others. The same rules that apply to Schedule IV apply to Schedule V substances.  Effects  A study conducted in 2000 supported the view that the new, tougher policy had had a preventive effect on drug use. A report by the UNODC praised Sweden for having one of the lowest drug usage rates in the western world, and attributed this to a drug policy that invested heavily in prevention and treatment (including free community services), as well as in strict law enforcement.UNODC: Sweden's successful drug policy, 2007 However, the methodology of the UNODC report has been criticized for being unscientific and fundamentally biased in favour of repressive drug laws, since Sweden was the fourth largest donor to the UNODC in 2007.Peter Cohen: Looking at the UN, smelling a rat: A comment on \\"Sweden‚Äôs successful drug policy: a review of the evidence\\" UNODC September 2006 According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), in 2005, the rate of drug-related deaths per capita in Sweden was more than twice that of the Netherlands and there were more persons addicted to severe narcotics (\\"heavy drugs\\") than in other countries. White House Drug Policy Director Kerlikowske in 2011 cited Sweden's Drug Control Policies as Model for U.S.; prevalence rates for cocaine use in Sweden are barely one-fifth of fellow European countries, such as the United Kingdom and Spain.White House Drug Policy Director Kerlikowske Meets with Swedish Counterdrug Officials, ONDCP, 21 March 2011 Between 2005 and 2013, the EMCDDA recorded a more than doubling in the rate of drug-induced mortality among adults (15‚Äì64) in Sweden, with the country moving from having the ninth to having the second highest rate in Europe. EMCDDA: Drug-induced mortality rates among adults (15‚Äì64) There is no evidence that the increase in the number of drug-related deaths is due to an increase in the number of injecting drug users; most indications are that the number of injecting drug users has declined. There are several other causes behind the increase in the reported number. History Historically, Sweden has been a poor country with a comparably low standard of living. Although it is a member of the vodka belt and has a tradition of widespread tobacco use, other drugs were rarely used until the mid-20th century. The 19th century, saw the rise of the temperance movement, alongside the free churches and the labour movement.SFI: The health of the swedish people ‚Äì a historical perspective, 2004 State alcohol rationing, state monopoly on retail stores in alcohol, and temperance boards in the municipalities were introduced around the First World War. This decreased alcohol use to a level that was low through the 1930s, during the worldwide economic crises. The temperance boards continued to exist after alcohol rationing ended in 1955. =The first narcotics law= The first official narcotics law came in 1923 with the Royal Ordinance on Narcotic Drugs, or Narkotikakung√∂relsen, when Sweden joined the International Opium Convention. The law regulated the import and export of some opiates and cocaine. In 1930, the law was extended to include more opium derivatives and cannabis. Possession was restricted as well. Initially, the punishments consisted of fines. Before Narkotikakung√∂relsen, a person's use of drugs was considered a personal choice of the user and their doctor. Non- medical drug use was rarely seen, but did exist among medical personnel, bohemian artists, writers and jazz musicians. Often the drugs used were supplied by prescription. =Introduction of amphetamines= In 1938, amphetamine was introduced in Sweden, and a year later required a prescription. In 1942, approximately 3% of the Swedish population had a prescription for amphetamine, while the vast majority used under five amphetamine tablets per year, about 3,000 citizens were known to take it daily and among them about 200 used over 10 amphetamine tablets per day.\\"The Swedish experience\\" in The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs, 1972, http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/library/studies/cu/CU39.html In 1942, amphetamine was added to the list of controlled substances. Gradually the supervisory authority, the Royal Medical Board, made more stringent recommendations for prescribing narcotic drugs. Sometime in the late 1940s, a group of artists began dissolving amphetamine tablets in water so that it could be purified and injected intravenously. This habit was soon taken up among criminals in Stockholm. =Early changes in the drug laws= In the 1950s, there were signs of emerging drug use among criminals in Stockholm. On 27 April 1954, the first debate was held in the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament, regarding drug use. The center-right opposition had filed an interpellation about the drug problem. The issue discussed was whether the government considered that drug use justified an increased vigilance by society and, if so, if it was considering a change in the laws to rectify the problem. The Riksdag believed that further debate was unnecessary since information, collected from the Royal Medical Board and the Police, stated that drug abuse was not a serious problem in Sweden. In 1958, the punishments became harsher, setting a minimum fine and introducing up to six months imprisonment as a possible penalty. In 1962, the law was superseded by the Decree on Narcotic Drugs, Narkotikaf√∂rordningen, which increased the maximum prison term to two years. Amphetamines became the primary illicit drug until the late 1960s, when cannabis became more popular. In 1965, the maximum term was reduced to one year. There were signs of increasing drug use; hashish was smoked openly in major cities in the late 60s. The National Board of Health and Welfare, the agency that superseded the Royal Medical Board, argued that police would use the resources better than the prison system. The intention was to arrest more drug offenders, given the hope that a higher risk of getting caught in itself would have a more preventative effect then a long sentence. =The Legal Prescription Program= In 1965, the legal prescription of drugs began in Stockholm, after a campaign strongly supported by Expressen, the biggest newspaper in Sweden in the 1960s. Some doctors received the right to prescribe drugs, such as amphetamine and morphine, to addicts. The idea was that doctors would have the right to prescribe the drug to chronic addicts in order to reduce their propensity to commit crimes. An inspiration for this movement was a book, The Addict and the Law, written by American sociologist Alfred R. Lindesmith.The United States Needs to Follow Sweden's Lead in Drug Policy, RNS, November 2013 The Legal Prescription Program was controversial from the start; the users were allowed to determine the dosage and were given a few days ration with an option to refill when needed. More than 4 million normal doses were prescribed. A number of the clients were former prison inmates. Eventually, police seizures showed that the drugs had become available to persons not involved in the project. Nils Bejerot, who opposed the prescriptions and worked as consulting physician to the Stockholm Remand Prison, conducted studies of injections marks from drug abuse at the prison which indicated a strong increase in the number of intravenous drug users during the experiment.Nils Bejerot: The Swedish Addiction Epidemic in global perspective, 1988 The project ended in 1967, when a young girl was found dead from an overdose of morphine and amphetamine in the apartment of one of the participants.Jonas Hartelius: Nils Bejerot, 2002Boekhout van Solinge, Tim (1997), The Swedish drug control policy.

Foreword by Dr. Robert L. Dupont, M.D. The local temperance boards came about in the 1960s to work with drug abusers. In 1970, the municipal temperance boards merged in with the boards for social welfare and child social welfareNykterhetsn√§mnd 1916-1981 The Narcotic Drugs Penalty Code of 1968, including an increase of the maximum penalty for sale of illegal drugs from 2 years to 6 years in prison. The law distinguish between three grades of drug offences. Section 1 was applied for offences of normal severity: illegal production, offering for sale, transfer, and possession of narcotics were punishable by fines or imprisonment for not more than two years. Section 2 was applied for petty offences; punishable by fines only, nolle prosequi was easy to receive for minor drug crimes in the 1970s. Section 3 was applied for gross offences, punishable by imprisonment for between one and four years. When determining whether the offence was gross, special attention was to be paid to whether it was committed professionally, on a large scale, involved large amounts of drugs, or whether it was especially dangerous. But these were only examples of relevant factors; their presence was not a guarantee the offence was gross, and their absence did not mean the offence could not still be gross. The preparatory works mention that transfer of drugs to young people could lead to the offence's classification as gross. The danger of the drug involved was also to be taken into consideration. The Prosecutor General expressed the view that substances which threaten life or rapidly debilitate the addict should lead to the application of section 3 of the Narcotic Drugs Penalty Code. This group included opium derivatives, like heroin, as well as LSD. Michael Bogdan: Reflections on some international and Swedish legal rules relating to drug offences, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Lund, 1977 In 1969, fearing that low punishments would attract international drug traffickers, the government increased punishments for crimes involving the most gross degree, and the corresponding laws on smuggling were increased to a maximum penalty of six years. Hemp, which had been grown for industrial purposes, had not been affected by the opium conference in 1925. However, in 1970 cultivation of hemp was banned on the grounds that it was a drug. In 1972, the Narcotic Drugs Penalty Code was strengthened again, increasing the maximum prison sentence to ten years for more severe crimes. 1969‚Äì72, was a period of temporarily increased police resources for drug law enforcement but also frequent waiving of persecution for possession of illegal substances. In 1969, about 750 police took part in a short-term, fivefold increase in the numbers of officers engaged in drug enforcement. The resources allocated to drug work steadily decreased between 1970 and 1975.Johannes Knutsson: SWEDISH DRUG MARKETS AND DRUGS POLICY, National Police Academy, Norway, in Crime Prevention Studies Volume 11, 2000Prop. 1972:67 , p. 44. Only published in Swedish 1972‚Äì75, was a period with much lower police resources for drug- related crimes; the number of police officers dedicated to drug crimes was almost cut to the low level before 1970. In 1976‚Äì79, the Prosecutor General recommended that prosecutors lower the limit for drugs which could be ignored as personal use. Tougher prosecution policies were introduced by the chief prosecutor in Stockholm, and resources for drug law enforcement were again increased. From 1971‚Äì83, use of illegal drugs among 16-year-old boys fell from about 16% to 5%. =Subsequent policy changes= In the 1980s and 1990s, lawmakers continued to make smaller modifications of the drug laws, expanding their coverage, increasing maximum sentences, altering early release rules, and introducing treatment options as an alternative to imprisonment to be used at the discretion of the courts. In 1980, contract treatment for drug abuse as an alternative to imprisonment was implemented into the law. Contract treatment is a possible consequence of a clearly drug-related crime, and an option for any Swedish court; the option is not limited to special Drug courts. If the person misbehaves, the sentence can be transformed into a prison sentence.Red. Henrik Tham: Forskare om narkotikapolitiken, 2003, p. 6]Kriminalv√•rden: Contract treatment In 1981, the maximum imprisonment for ordinary crimes increased from two years to three. The minimum imprisonment for serious crimes increased from one year to two. In 1982, the Misuser Act (LVM) made it possible for municipalities to place very seriously drug dependent criminals in mandatory treatment with restrictions for a number of months. The same type of law had been used only for very serious alcoholics in the past. Mandatory treatment, according to this law, has been used for a hundreds people per year; in 2007, it was used for 330 people with serious drug problems, and 219 with both alcohol and drug problems.SiS statistik, 2007, p. 14] In 1988, all use of drugs, even in very small quantities, became a criminal offense, punishable with fines, under The Narcotic Drugs Penalty Code of 1968. In the same year, a special form of probation, contract treatment, became available as an alternative to imprisonment in cases of alcohol or drug-related crime. This treatment was available only to offenders willing to undergo the drug or alcohol treatment as decided by the courts.Ministry of Justice, Sweden: Information about the Swedish prison and probation service, 2004 In the beginning of the 1990s, Sweden had a financial crisis with up to 500% as the interest rate. This hurt the local economy with the cutting of tax financed social budgets. For example, the number of residential treatment places decreased by 40%. Many specialized drugs squads all over the country disappeared. In 1993, the maximum sentence for illicit use of drugs was raised to six months in prison, though the normal punishment remained a fine. The reason for raising the maximum penalty for drug use to six months' imprisonment was to make it legal for police to conduct a body search, which may only be implemented if someone is suspected of a crime carrying at least six months' imprisonment as the maximum punishment. In the same year, the law was amended to allow for early release of all prisoners, not only those convicted of drug crimes. Between 1983 and 1993, in principle, prisoners were released after serving half the time. For those who were convicted after 1 July 1993, the rule became two thirds of the imprisonment term. After 1999, early release became conditional. On 1 January 1995, Sweden became a member of the European Union (EU). One effect of the EU's rules was reduced control of illicit drugs at the borders. The Swedish customs authority stop making random stops on the traffic and passengers who enter from EU countries; the number of employees in the Swedish customs authority is reduced by a third.Motion 1994/95:Sk648 Nedsk√§rningar vid tullen Surveys of illicit drug showed use in the last month almost doubled drug use among 16-year-old boys (from 5% to 10%, mostly cannabis) in 2000. The level had been essentially stable since 1983 (below 5% usage in the last month for boys and 2% usage for girls).EMCDDA: National Report, 2006 , p. 12]ECAD: SWEDEN‚ÄôS SUCCESSFUL DRUG POLICY: A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE Statistical annex Between 2000‚Äì01, professor Johannes Knutsson concludes after a study of drug use and drug policy in Sweden that the \\"stricter enforcement contributed to Sweden by international standards has a lower percentage of young people who tried drugs.\\" =National Alcohol and Drug Action Plan= In 2002, Parliament approved the National Alcohol and Drug Action Plan for the years 2002‚Äì2006. > \\"The objective of the Swedish drug policy should continue to be a drug-free > society.

In 2005, in compliance with EU rules, cultivation of industrial hemp with less than 0.2% THC was legalized providing the farmer followed a number of rules such as yearly registration of the field.G√•rdsst√∂d f√∂r odling av hampa ‚Äì Jordbruksverket, March 2007. In 2005, the Prosecutor General issued a recommendation containing more than 100 pages to prosecutors about penalties they will require for drug offenses based on previous judgments of the Supreme Court in Sweden. The report also contained a classification of hazard of more than 50 different drugs. The recommendation was expanded for a revised edition in 2009 and 2010.R√§ttsPM 2009:1 Narkotika, √Öklagarmyndighetens Utvecklingscentrum, July 2010 Published only in Swedish In 2006, Parliament approved an updated National Alcohol and Drug Action Plan for the years 2006‚Äì2010. The strategy was similar to the 2002 plan. The overall objective of the Swedish drugs policy is: a drug-free society. There are three sub-objectives: * reduce recruitment to drug abuse * induce people with substance abuse problems to give up their abuse * reduce the supply of drugsThe Swedish action plan on narcotic drugs 2006‚Äì2010Prop 2005/06:30 , p. 3 In 2007, an updated study showed a continued decline in drug use among pupils and high school students.Erik Fender, Thomas Hvitfeldt:Skolelevers drogvanor 2007 Police efforts to combat drug use focused on drug supply prior to 1980, data support the conclusion that it had a preventive effect. As police efforts began to focus on demand reduction (from 1980 to 1992) drug use of cannabis continued to drop. Among 9th year students, drug experimentation was highest in the beginning of the 1970s. Drug experimentation was falling throughout the 1980s, redoubling in the 1990s, and falling again in the 2000s. Estimates of heavy drug addicts have risen from 6,000 in 1967 to 15,000 (1979), 19,000 (1992), and 26,000 (1998). According to inpatient data, there were 28,000 such addicts in 2001 and 26,000 in 2004, but these last two figures may represent the recent trend in Sweden towards out-patient treatment of drug addicts rather than an actual decline in drug addictions.CAN:Drug Trends in Sweden 2007, pp. 7‚Äì11 Amphetamines are still the drug most used by problem drug users, whereas heroin is the main problem in most of Europe. Between 2006 and 2013, drug-induced mortality rates in Sweden have risen steadily, with the country moving from having the ninth to the second highest rate in Europe. EMCDDA: Drug-induced mortality rates among adults (15‚Äì64) From 1 April 2011, the police and customs may seize synthetic drugs that are not on the list of drugs covered by the anti-drug laws if the police suspect that the purpose of the holding is related to drug abuse. It's about synthetic drugs that manufacturers changed a bit in the recipe so that the drug therefore become lawful. See also designer drugs. Following a decision by a prosecutor, the police may destroy the seized. The reason for this change in the law are a number of deaths due to ingestion of unclassified synthetic drugs, often sold in online stores.Nu beslagtar svenska tullen lagliga droger, Sveriges Radio, 23 april 2011 The last decade, the treatment of drug addicts with Methadone and Subutex and the number of people in the syringe exchange programs increased significantly. The number of clinics that provide treatment with Methadone or Subutex has increased from one clinic to 110 clinics. The downside of this development is much less control over who gets those drugs and how much. An increasing number of drug-related deaths can be linked to over-consumed prescribed drugs. This has led to claims that the number of doctors who can prescribe such drugs must be strictly limited to a minor number of specialist.Sven Britton et all: ‚ÄùNarkotika sprids via recept‚Äù, Svd, 2016-07-28 Implementation Since 1993, the police have had the legal right to take action against people they suspect of being under the influence of drugs even if they are not disturbing anyone. Many Swedish police officers have, since 1993, received training in how to recognize the signs and symptoms of being under the influence of drugs. In such cases, the suspect may have to produce a blood or urine sample for analysis. About 27,500 drug use verification tests and 10,000 drugged driving and drug use tests (two separate offences) were carried out in 2006. If the sample contains drugs or traces of drugs, the person is guilty of a personal use minor drug offence. One of the justifications for this legislation was to make it possible to find and apprehend people to offer care and treatment at as early a stage as possible. The police have an obligation to inform the social services of all cases of drug use that come to their attention. The penalty for drug offences depends upon the seriousness of the offence. For minor drug offences, the court may impose a fine or prison sentence of up to six months. More serious offences always carry a prison sentence, usually up to a maximum of three years. If the offence is considered particularly serious, the sentence will be anything from a minimum of two to a maximum of ten years. In 2005, there were 18,818 total prosecutions. Of these, 73% were for minor drug offences, 25% for drugs offences (give often some months to a some years in prison), and 2% for serious drug offences (give normally several years in prison). Brottsf√∂rebyggande r√•det, 2008 In recent years, drug testing of suspected abusers has been used as a first step in motivating them to seek treatment.THE SWEDISH NATIONAL DRUG POLICY COORDINATOR: MUMIN- motivating young drug abusers to treatment, 2007 Eva Br√§nnmark Detective Superintendent Law Enforcement ‚Äì the Swedish Model, 2007 Conditional sentences for drug offenses includes such measures as mandatory urine tests or treatment. The anti-drug program also includes information and low cost treatment for any citizen with an addiction to drugs.Your rights and options in treatment and care of drug addicts, Produced for the National Action Plan on Narcotic Drugs, 2008 Treatment for drug dependency in various parts of The Prison, Probation and Rehabilitation Authority (Kriminalv√•rden') is described in The Acton plan of 2006 as a very important part of the Drug Policy of Sweden. Contract treatment instead of prison is primarily used for recurrent drug addicts where there is a clear link between a crime and the addiction. Instead of serving a prison sentence of up to two years, the convicted person signs a contract with the court to undergo a treatment programme (at an institution or at home), to partake in non-custodial care, or both. 1,439 persons were sentenced to contract treatment in 2006.Swedish Prison and Probation Service: Basic Facts, 2007 Almost every municipality has its own local anti-drug coordinator to provide a broad drug preventive work directed at youths, in cooperation with politicians, police, church, educational associations and societies.Drug coordinator - drug preventive work in the municipality of H√•bo. A small municipality in Sweden with 19000 citizens, 2008 Sweden has a number of non governmental anti-drug organizations as well. Imprisonment for drug crimes In 2004, Sweden had 84 people per 100,000 in either prison or remand prison. This is less than the average for the OECD (132 people per 100,000) and much less than the number for the United States (725 per 100,000).Human Development Report 2007/2008 - Prison population (per 100,000 people) The average number of prisoners per day is 4700.Basic facts, Swedish Prison and Probation Service, Head Office, 2008 Minor drug related crimes, like own use of illegal drugs, provides only a daily fine but means that the person ends up in the Police records. If the penalty was only fines the police erase the penalty from the Police record after 5 years.Polisen:Gallringsregler f√∂r belastningsregistret Some employers and others can demand an extract from Police records e.g. before employment. In 2008, 23% of those imprisoned were primarily convicted for drug crimes or goods trafficking. A majority of the prisoners have more or less serious drug addiction before they come to the prison, but random drug test of the prisoners show a low and decreasing number (less than 2%) of ongoing drug use inside the Swedish prisons. This has helped to create a more calm situation also in high security prisons.Inga internetdroger i landets anstalter, Kriminalv√•rden , 12 July 2011.

By comparison the figures for the U.K. were 4.38 (2006) to 4.46 (2013), and for the Netherlands less than 1.0 per 100,000 population. EMCDDA: Drug-induced mortality rates among adults (15‚Äì64) The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare believes that the reported increase very largely is result of improved, more sophisticated methods to detect drug-related deaths and more analyzes of blood than before. It can not be excluded that there also has been a real increase in the number of drug-related deaths.Socialstyrelsen: Narkotikarelaterade d√∂dsfall En analys av 2014 √•rs d√∂dsfall och utveckling av den officiella statistiken, 2016-02-29 According to the EMCDDA standard definition that only counts deaths directly related to drug consumption, there were 157 drug-related deaths recorded in 2006, of a total Swedish population of 9.2 million (1.7 people per 100,000). Morphine (including Heroin), methadone and amphetamines cause most of the registered drug-related deaths in Sweden.Fugelstad, Anna (2011) \\"Akuta narkotikarelaterade d√∂dsfall 2011 ; rapport f√∂r Folkh√§lsoinstitutet \\" (in Swedish: \\"Acute drug-realated deaths 2011 ; report prepared for the Swedish National Institute of Public Health\\") Karolinska Institute In the same year, the number of drug-related recorded deaths in the Netherlands amounted to 112, of a total population of 16.5 million (0.68 people per 100,000). The reported drug-related death rate in U.S. was 12.6 per 100,000, the reported drug- related death rate in the U.K. was 39.8 per 100,000.National Center for Health StatisticsEMCDDA:Country overview: United Kingdom In Sweden, drug-related deaths is counted in three ways. One is according to the EMCDDA definition for international comparisons presented above, but a general weakness of the EMCDDA's statistics is that many drug-related deaths are treated as death of natural causes even though the deaths are due to a disease that typically comes after a long period of substance abuse or due to an accident under influence of drugs. The other two take that in account and find usage in national comparisons over time. The longest series of statistics is from the register on Causes of Death, it includes cases where drug-related diagnoses is noted on the death certificate both as direct and underlying cause. There is also a line of statistics for which all cases where illicit drugs are detected in the blood of the deceased is registered, the so-called Toxbase. Using the definition for Toxbase, 292 cases where drug-related in 2006. With the definition for the register of causes of death, 242 cases were drug-related in 2006.Davstad, Ingrid et al (2011) \\"Self-reported drug use and mortality among a nationwide sample of Swedish conscripts - A 35-year follow-up\\" ResearchGateOfficial statistics of Sweden: \\"Causes of Death 2009 \\" The National Board of Health and Welfare (2011) Drugs and driving The Swedish traffic police have a zero tolerance policy for driving influenced by drugs. Annually about 2.5 million random tests are performed for alcohol and about 12 thousand tests on suspicion of drugs.Bl√•stestet avsl√∂jar knarkade bilf√∂rare, Ny Teknik, 9 March 2011 The limit for alcohol is the same as in most European countries, zero point two promilles (0.02 milligram per 100 milligram of blood). Sweden has among the lowest mortality rate in the world in road traffic, with 2.8 fatalities/100,000 populationIRTAD Annual Report 2011 This however doesn't affect the ones with an prescription for an illegal drug like amphetamine known as Adderall, unless stated which is the case with most dissociatives and other drugs which can seriously affect driving like opioids. Health care for drug abusers All Swedish citizens have the right to health care at a health clinic owned by the County Council or, in the case of a medical emergency, at hospital owned by the County Council. Most Swedes have therefore no private health insurance.Dalarna County Council A medical consultation will cost between US$14 and $50 including the cost of various laboratory tests. For professionals in health care any information about a patient's drug abuse is confidential by law unless the patient is suspected of a crime that could result in at least two years imprisonment or of driving under the influence of drugs. A person who has developed a drug addiction can apply to the local social welfare board in his home community to become admitted to a treatment center for drug addicts in another part of the country. If the application is approved, the social welfare board pay the treatment including all cost for staying at the treatment center for several months. The social welfare board is financed by local taxes. This type of treatment is expensive (but less expensive than a long imprisonment for crimes) so only a few thousands of applications are approved per year. Cannabis in health care Treatment with drugs that are extracts or synthetic variants of cannabis are not legal to use in health care with one small exception. Nabiximols, trade name Sativex, a cannabinoid oromucosal mouth spray, was approved in December 2011, for multiple sclerosis (MS); only on prescription as a third alternative to two other approved drugs for that condition to patients who not responded adequately to other medication for spasticity and show a clinically relevant improvement of symptoms related to spasticity during an initial trial treatment. About 13,000 people in Sweden have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), about 50 of them used Sativex December 2011. The Pharmacy Company that sells Sativex state that the risk for drug dependence is lower for Sativex than the morphine based alternatives because the dose of THC so low that the patients shall not be \\"high\\" on it. Drug test It is common that big- and midsize companies have a zero tolerance policy for illegal drugs and demand a drug test for new employees. Those big- and midsize company normally also demand the same rules for subcontractors and consultants that visit them. Random drug tests among all employees has also become more common.Bo Joffer: ABB inf√∂r slumpvisa drogtester av var fj√§rde anst√§lld.

Only hemp with less than 0.2% THC is allowed.G√•rdsst√∂d f√∂r mark d√§r du odlar hampa Jordbruksverket Criticism An often repeated criticism is that a decline in resources for treatment of drug addicts started in the 1990s. If the person has not been convicted for a serious crime so must that person's home municipality pay a large part of treatment for drug addiction. The same committee in the municipality is also responsible for supporting other groups like old, the disabled, refugees, long-term unemployed and others within a limited budget. These other groups often have the support of relatives or strong local associations that speak for them against the municipality. Relatives of drug addicts do not have the same strong position. Information on a drug addict age 18 or older are covered by confidentiality. This confidentiality also applies to near relatives. Relatives of addicts has not, in practice, the same legal possibility, as some other groups, to appeal against the lack of care to any court. All these factors together end in that only a small proportion of drug abusers get more intensive treatment for their drug addiction or that treatment begins only after the abuse has been become very serious.

The child hesitates to move forward as they see the transparent surface. The Visual Cliff is an apparatus created by psychologists Eleanor J. Gibson and Richard D. Walk at Cornell University to investigate depth perception in human and animal species. The visual cliff apparatus allowed them to conduct an experiment in which the optical and tactile stimuli associated with a simulated cliff were adjusted while protecting the subjects from injury. copy The visual cliff consisted of a sheet of Plexiglas that covers a cloth with a high-contrast checkerboard pattern. On one side the cloth is placed immediately beneath the Plexiglas, and on the other it is dropped about below. Using a visual cliff apparatus, Gibson and Walk examined possible perceptual differences at crawling age between human infants born preterm and human infants born at term without documented visual or motor impairments.  Visual Cliff Study (1960)  Gibson and Walk (1960) hypothesized that depth perception is inherent as opposed to a learned process. To test this, they placed 36 infants, six to fourteen months of age, on the shallow side of the visual cliff apparatus. Once the infant was placed on the opaque end of the platform, the caregiver (typically a parent) stood on the other side of the transparent plexiglas, calling out for them to come or holding an enticing stimulus such as a toy. This allowed so the infant would be motivated to crawl across towards them. It was assumed if the child was reluctant to crawl to their caregiver, he or she was able to perceive depth, believing that the transparent space was an actual cliff.Cherry, Kendra. What Is a Visual Cliff? psychology.about.com. The researchers found that 27 of the infants crawled over to their mother on the \\"shallow\\" side without any problems.Watch Out For The Visual Cliff. The Neuron (29 March 2009). A few of the infants crawled but were extremely hesitant. Some infants refused to crawl because they were confused about the perceived drop between them and their mothers. The infants knew the glass was solid by patting it, but still did not cross. In this experiment, all of the babies relied on their vision in order to navigate across the apparatus. This shows that when healthy infants are able to crawl, they can perceive depth. However, results do not indicate that avoidance of cliffs and fear of heights is innate.  Infant Studies  During early development, infants begin to crawl, sit, and walk. These actions impact how the infants view depth perception. Thus, infant studies are an important part of the visual cliff. When an infant starts to engage in crawling, to sit, or walking, they use perception and action. During this time, infants begin to develop a fear of height. The everyday exploration of infants gives them clues about things or objects to avoid when exploring. Other research that has used the visual cliff focuses on preterm infants, prelocomotor Infants, and maternal signaling. = Preterm Infants = Sixteen infants born at term and sixteen born preterm were encouraged to crawl to their caregivers on a modified visual cliff. Successful trials, crossing time, duration of visual attention, duration of tactile exploration, motor strategies, and avoidance behaviors were analyzed. A significant surface effect was found, with longer crossing times and longer durations of visual attention and tactile exploration in the condition with the visual appearance of a deep cliff. Although the two groups of infants did not differ on any of the timed measurements, infants born at term demonstrated a larger number of motor strategies and avoidance behaviors by simple tally. This study indicates that infants born at term and those born preterm can perceive a visual cliff and change their responses accordingly. = Prelocomotor Infants = Another study measured the cardiac responses of human infants younger than crawling age on the visual cliff. This study found that the infants exhibited distress less frequently when they were placed on the shallow side of the apparatus in contrast to when they were placed on the deep side. This means that prelocomotor infants can discriminate between the two sides of the cliff. = Maternal Signaling = James F Sorce et al. tested maternal emotional signaling to see how maternal emotional signaling affected the behaviors of one-year-olds on the visual cliff. To do this they placed the infants on the shallow side of the visual cliff apparatus and had their mothers on the other side of the visual cliff eliciting different emotional facial expressions. When the mothers posed joy or interest most of the babies crossed the deep side but if the mothers posed fear or anger, most of the babies did not cross the apparatus. On the contrary, in the absence of depth, most of the babies crossed regardless of the mother's facial expressions. This suggests that babies look to their mother's emotional expressions for advice most often when they are uncertain about the situation. Joseph J. Campos research focuses on facial expressions between the caregiver and infant. Specifically his researcher shows that the infants will not crawl if the caregiver expresses a signal of distress. If the caregiver gives the infant a positive facial expression the child is more likely to crawl across the visual cliff.  Visual Cliff Experiments with Animals  Before Gibson and Walk conducted their study with human infants, multiple experiments were conducted using rats, one-day-old chicks, newborn kids, kittens, pigs, adult chickens, dogs, lambs, and monkeys. Overall, most species would avoid the deep side of the visual cliff, some right after being born. The first visual cliff experiment was conducted with rats who were raised in the dark and in the light. The results were that both groups of rats would walk all over the shallow and deep parts of the cliff without an issue, which surprised Gibson, Walk, and Thomas Tighe (a research assistant). A later experiment with kittens raised in the dark and then placed on the visual cliff showed that depth perception was not innate in all species as the kittens would walk on either side of the visual cliff. After six days of being in the light, the kittens would avoid the deep side of the visual cliff (Rodkey, 2015). Later researchers conducted experiments using other species. = Rats = Rats do not depend upon visual cues like some of the other species tested. Their nocturnal habits lead them to seek food largely by smell. When moving about in the dark, they respond to tactual cues from their stiff whiskers (vibrissae) located on the snout. Hooded rats tested on the visual cliff show little preference for either side of the visual cliff apparatus as long as they could feel the glass with their vibrissae. When placed upon the glass over the deep side, they move about as if there was no cliff. = Cats = Cats, like rats, are nocturnal animals, sensitive to tactual cues from their vibrissae. But the cat, as a predator, must rely more on its sight. Kittens were observed to have excellent depth- discrimination. At four weeks, the earliest age that a kitten can skillfully move about, they preferred the shallow side of the cliff. When placed on the glass over the deep side, they either freeze or circle backward until they reach the shallow side of the cliff. = Turtles = The late Robert M. Yerkes of Harvard University found in 1904 that aquatic turtles have somewhat worse depth-discrimination than land turtles. On the visual cliff one might expect an aquatic turtle to respond to the reflections from the glass as it might to water and prefer the deep side for this reason. They showed no such preference; 76% of the aquatic turtles crawled onto the shallow side. The large percentage that choose the deep side suggests either that this turtle has worse depth-discrimination than other animals, or that its natural habitat gives it less occasions to \\"fear\\" a fall. = Cows = The ability for cows to perceive a visual cliff was tested by NA Arnold et al. Twelve dairy heifers were exposed to a visual cliff in the form of a milking pit while walking through a milking facility. Over this five-day experiment the heifers‚Äô heart rates were measured along with the number of times they stopped throughout the milking facility. Dairy heifers in the experimental group were exposed to a visual cliff while dairy heifers in the control group were not. The experimental group was found to have significantly higher heart rates and stop more frequently than the heifers in the control group. Depth exposure did not have any effect on cortisol levels or the ease of handling of the animals. These findings provide evidence of both depth perception and acute fear of heights in cows. This may lead to a reorganization of the way milking factories function.  Criticisms  One of the criticisms of the visual cliff study was whether the research in the study really supported the hypothesis that depth perception was innate in humans. One issue was about the glass over the deep part of the visual cliff. By covering up the deep side with glass the researchers enabled the babies to feel the solidity of the glass before they would cross over. This response was repeated over and over again in tests. Adolph, K. E., & Kretch, K. S., Infants on the Edge: Beyond the Visual Cliff, Adobe PowerPoint Another criticism has to do with the experience of the infant. Infants who learned to crawl before 6.5 months of age had crossed the glass, but the ones that learned to crawl after 6.5 months of age avoided crossing the glass. This helps support the hypothesis that experience does influence avoidance of the glass, rather than just being innate. Nancy Rader, Mary Bausano and John E.

It is located at an elevated position within Kay Park, to the east of Kilmarnock Town Centre. The monument was opened in 1879, and is a category B listed building. In 2004 a fire destroyed part of the monument. The building was restored and extended as a genealogy centre, reopening as the Burns Monument Centre in 2009. History Kilmarnock has many links with Burns; the first edition of his work was printed here in 1786, by John Wilson, a local printer. Of this first edition only 612 copies were printed, and copies of this rare book are now known as Kilmarnock Editions. The original monument, circa 1900 On Burns Night 1877, a movement to erect a memorial in Kilmarnock was begun. Subscriptions came in so quickly that the organisers decided to investigate the possibility of a memorial building as well as a marble statue. In October, a design by local architect Robert S Ingram was accepted by the committee, and he began the preparation of drawings. In December, a design competition for the statue attracted 21 entries, and William Grant Stevenson of Edinburgh was judged the winner. The foundation stone was laid on 14 September 1878, by R. W. Cochran- Patrick of Woodside, Depute Provincial Grand Master for Ayrshire. In August 1879, the Kay Park was opened, with the completed Burns Monument as its focus. The statue was officially unveiled by Colonel Charles Alexander of Ballochmyle MP on 9 August. The monument cost around ¬£1,500, with another ¬£800 spent on the statue. The design of the monument has been described as \\"an eclectic fusion of Scots Baronial, neo-Gothic and Italianate, with a dash of Baroque and a hint of Romanesque.\\" The original building comprised a two-storey T-plan museum, topped by an high octagonal tower and spire, with the life-size white marble statue of Burns by Stevenson in a porch at the front. The tower offered wide views across Kilmarnock. Ingram, a prolific local architect, considered the monument to be his finest work. Fire and redevelopment The monument was badly damaged by fire in November 2004. The two storey museum section, at the rear, and the semi-octagonal two-storey tower collapsed, leaving only the front stairs, porch, part of the ground floor outer walls and two of the main internal walls. The redeveloped extension Planning permission was granted in September 2006 for the partial re-instatement of the Burns Monument, with an extension to provide a marriage suite, registration service and archive service. The extension, designed by East Ayrshire Council architects, envelopes the remaining staircase and portico, which houses the statue of Robert Burns, and provides a courtyard setting with the statue of Burns and the remaining section of the original monument as a focal point to the northern elevation of the courtyard. The ¬£5m Burns Monument Centre was opened in May 2009 by First Minister Alex Salmond, as Scotland's first purpose-built genealogy centre. In July 2010, it was announced that the rebuilt Centre was one of six buildings nominated for the annual Carbuncle Cup, given to the \\"ugliest building in the UK completed in the last 12 months.\\" The Carbuncle Cup is given by Building Design magazine, based on nominations from the public. The nominator of the Burns Monument Centre described it as a \\"forced, clumpy monstrosity with pointlessly random rooves\\".

Design  The World War I Memorial was designed by Pietro Montana, an Italian-born painter and sculptor. Montana studied at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in Manhattan, New York City, New York. Montana's monuments were well-known, particularly in New York, and included an earlier \\"Doughboy\\" sculpture erected in 1920 to honor the war dead of the Bushwick, Brooklyn and Ridgewood, Queens. The success of this the earlier \\"Fighting Doughboy\\" memorial resulted in the production of three copies by 1921. By 1932, he had produced over 40 statues and won a gold medal from the National Academy of Design for \\"Orphans\\" in 1931. For the design of the sculpture, Montana modeled Charles Atlas and \\"strove to communicate the U.S. doughboy's upstanding character and valor by way of a muscle-bound physique\\". In 1926, the East Providence Memorial Committee expressed concerns that Montana's design was \\"too brutal\\" and modified the original design provided by Montana. The statue was erected in 1927, and formally dedicated on July 30, 1927. At the dedication, Major General Charles Pelot Summerall gave an address which highlighted the handicap placed upon the soldiers by a lack of preparedness and \\"invoked the fighting ideal embodied by Montana's doughboy.\\" The sculpture of a soldier stands tall, wide and deep. Ronald J. Onorato, author of the National Register nomination, writes that \\"the soldier stands with legs apart, his left hand at his belt, the right at his side. The face is impassive and expressionless. He wears a disheveled infantry uniform, rough shoes, the shirt collar open and askew, the sleeves rolled back, the knee torn open, his helmet on the ground behind his left foot. ... A holster hangs from the belt on the soldier's right hip.\\" Montana signed the sculpture with \\"Pietro Montana/SC/1927.\\" The sculpture rests atop a grey granite base that is tall, wide and deep. The corners of the base have small leaf designed and has by bronze reliefs with arched tops on each side. The front relief states that it was erected in the memory of the citizens of East Providence who served in World War I from 1917 to 1918, and lists the names of twenty three soldiers. The left relief depicts a marching infantry column of one man on horseback and four on foot, the right relief depicts four or five men loading a cannon and the rear relief depicts a nurse assisting two wounded soldiers. At the time of its nomination, the sculpture was described as in \\"moderately good condition\\", with the surface being both stained and pitted, but free or breaks or missing pieces. The statue still stands in its original location in front of a school that has since been re- purposed for residential housing.  Importance  The World War I Memorial designed by Montana is \\"historically significant as the city's principal effort to honor those who served in the first World War and because it is an unusually successful depiction of the soldier in battle.\\" The larger-than-life masculine figure depicted in the sculpture stands apart from the stock figures of other war monuments by its dynamic pose, as if the soldier was \\"[arising from] the heat of battle\\".

He was the fourth son and fifth child among seven siblings. His parents, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich (1866‚Äì1933) and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna (1875‚Äì1960), were first cousins once removed. Consequently, Prince Dmitri was the great-grandson of Tsar Nicholas I (from his father's side) while the great-great-grandson of the same Tsar Nicholas I (from his mother's one), the grandson of Tsar Alexander III and the nephew of Tsar Nicholas II. During the Russian Revolution Prince Dmitri was imprisoned along with his parents and grandmother the Dowager Empress at Dulber, in the Crimea. He escaped the fate of a number of his Romanov cousins who were murdered by the Bolsheviks when he was freed by German troops in 1918. He left Russia on 11 April 1919, at the age of seventeen, aboard the Royal Navy ship to attend to Malta where they spent nine months before settling to England.Royal Russia - The fate of the Romanovs: The Survivors Exile In exile, Prince Dmitri lived between England and France. He had a varied career. In the late 1920s he emigrated to the United States where he worked as a stockbroker in Manhattan. He returned to Europe in the early 1930s. For a brief period in the 1930s, he managed Coco Chanel's shop at Biarritz. It was through Chanel that he met a Russian aristocrat who worked as model for her fashion house: Countess Marina Sergeievna Golenistcheva-Koutouzova (20 November 1912 ‚Äì 7 January 1969). She was the second daughter of Count Sergei Alexandrovich Golenishchev-Kutuzov (1885 ‚Äì 1950) and his wife Maria Alexandrovna, born Chernysheva-Bezobrazova (1890 ‚Äì 1960). After the revolution, Marina and her family moved to Kislovodsk and later to Crimea, where her father served as head of the Yalta County. In August 1920 the family was evacuated to Istanbul and then to Paris. In the French capital, Marina began to work for Chanel. Prince Dmitri fell in love with her and they married in Paris on 25 October 1931. The wedding attracted a lot of attention and the bride wore a Chanel wedding dress. The couple had one daughter : *Princess Nadejda Dmitrievna (4 July 1933 ‚Äì 17 September 2002). Nadejda married Anthony Allen, with whom she had two daughters and one son: Penelope, Marina and Alexander; after divorcing Allen, she married William Hall Clark. During World War II, Prince Dmitri served as a Lieutenant Commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.Be√©che & Hall, Apapa: Christian IX of Denmark and his Descendants, p. 211 After the war, he became secretary of the travelers club in Paris. In 1947 he divorced Princess Marina who moved with their daughter to the United States. In 1949 she remarried Otto de Neufville (1898‚Äì1971), a descendant of a French-German aristocratic family. Marina Sergeievna Golenistcheva-Koutouzova died on January 7, 1969, in Sharon, Connecticut. During the 1950s, Prince Dmitri studied wine-making and worked as the European sales representative for a whisky firm in London. As his ex-wife did, Prince Dmitri also remarried. His second wife was the Dowager Lady Milbanke, n√©e Margaret Sheila MacKellar Chisholm (9 September 1898 ‚Äì 13 October 1969). Born in rural New South Wales, Australia, she was married, firstly, to Francis St Clair-Erskine, Lord Loughborough (heir to the 5th Earl of Rosslyn), and secondly, to Sir John Milbanke, 11th baronet. She married Prince Dmitri on 20 October 1954. No children were born of this marriage. The couple lived modestly in Belgravia, in central London. Princess Dmitri died October 13, 1969, and was buried in a chapel, near Edinburgh, next to her youngest son, Peter St. Clair-Erskine, who had died, at the age of twenty, in 1939. Following the creation of the Romanov Family Association in 1979, Prince Dmitri was chosen as its first president serving until his death a year later in England.

The shipyard has been state-owned since its founding in 1865 and is now operated as Jiangnan Shipyard (Group) Co. Ltd. Before 2009, the company was south of central Shanghai at 2 Gaoxing Road (). In 2009, the shipyard was moved to Changxing Island, in the mouth of the Yangtze River to the north of urban Shanghai. (). The shipyard builds, repairs and converts both civilian and military ships. Other activities include the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment, pressure vessels and steel works for various land-based products. History =Kiangnan Arsenal= Gun transportation at Kiangnan Arsenal in Shanghai, during the Self-Strengthening Movement. The origins of the Jiangnan Shipyard lie in the Self-Strengthening Movement of the late 19th century in China, during the Qing Dynasty. The Self-Strengthening Movement (), c. 1861 ‚Äì 1895, was a period of institutional reforms initiated in China during the late Qing dynasty following a series of military defeats and concessions to foreign powers. One of the projects in this campaign of modernisation was the establishment of defence industries, including the Kiangnan Arsenal in Shanghai in 1865 (the fourth year of the Tongzhi era). Plans for the arsenal were established under Zeng Guofan, who served as Viceroy of Liangjiang, although its actual establishment became the responsibilities of Li Hongzhang. The Manderin Chinese name of the Kiangnan Arsenal was the General Bureau of Machine Manufacture of Jiangnan (), or the Jiangnan (or Kiangnan) Machine Works for short. It was established to both manufacture firearms and also build naval vessels. The shipyard, plant and machinery were initially leased from Thomas Hunt and Company, an American firm within the concessions of Shanghai. Due to the influx of workers and the reluctance of the concession authorities to allow arms to be manufactured within their territory, the Chinese authorities purchased the plant and equipment and combined these with the existing assets of the old Suzhou and Anqing arsenals as well as new equipment purchased by Yung Wing in the United States to form the new Kiangnan Arsenal in 1865. The Kiangnan Arsenal was the largest of the arsenals established during the Self-Strengthening Movement, and also the one with the largest budget‚Äîfrom 1869, its annual budget was more than 400,000 silver taels. A series of high officials, including Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, and Zhang Zhidong, served as its head, although Li Hongzhang served the longest term during the Qing Dynasty. Most of the senior technical staff were Westerners, such as the first chief engineer, American T. F. Falls, and prolific translator John Fryer. During the Tongzhi era, the Arsenal was the largest weapons factory in East Asia. Among its other achievements were the first domestically produced steam boat (the Huiji) in 1868 and the first domestically produced steel in 1891. As well as its manufacturing works, the Arsenal also comprised a language school, a translation house and a technical school. =Kiangnan Shipyard= In 1905, the shipbuilding operations of the Kiangnan Arsenal were de-merged into the separate Kiangnan Shipyard. In the 1920s Kiangnan built six new river gunboats for the US Navy South China Patrol on the Yangtze River. The remaining arms manufacturing arm of the Kiangnan Arsenal operated until its dissolution in 1937, at the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The shipyard was evacuated to Chongqing and re-established as the Chongqing Shipyard. Large parts of the assets of both the Arsenal and the Shipyard were left behind in Shanghai to be occupied by Japanese forces during the war. During this period, the Japanese occupying forces absorbed the plant and equipment of the Arsenal into the Shipyard. This combination was not reversed after the surrender of Japan. =Jiangnan Shipyard after 1949= New location of Jiangnan Shipyard - Changxingdao island After the establishment of the People's Republic of China under the Communist Party of China in 1949, the shipyard changed its Chinese name to the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory () in 1953. The shipyard was corporatised in 1996 and organised as a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation. Beginning in 1964, the Communist government moved a number of industrial and technological institutions of strategic importance inland, in preparation for a potential war with either the United States or the Soviet Union. The Jiangnan Shipyard was again moved to Chongqing during this period. Although the shipyard subsequently moved back to Shanghai, it retains two subsidiary shipyards in Chongqing. The Jiangnan Shipyard remained a focus of investment by the Chinese government during this period. Amongst other \\"firsts\\" in the People's Republic were the first ten-thousand-tonne hydraulic forging press, the first domestically designed ocean-going freight ship, the first ocean exploration and communication ship, the first liquid petroleum tanker, and the first sea- crossing train ferry. In August 2000, the Qiuxin Shipyard became a wholly owned subsidiary, although its name and identity remain. In 2010, the shipyard was requisitioned for Expo 2010. The shipyard's operations moved to Changxing Island, an island within Shanghai Municipality at the mouth of the Yangtze River. Staffing The total staffing is about 10,500.

The ministries of home, border affairs and defense have to be headed by a serving military officer. The military also appoints one of the country's two vice presidents. Hence, the country's civilian leaders have little influence over the security establishment. History Before independence, Myanmar had two quasi- constitutions, The government of Burma Act, 1935 and Constitution of Burma under Japanese occupation, 1943. After independence, Myanmar adopted three constitutions in 1947, 1974 and 2008. 2008 constitution is present constitution of Myanmar. =1947 Constitution= The 1947 constitution was drafted by Chan Htoon and was used from the country's independence in 1948 to 1962, when the constitution was suspended by the socialist Union Revolutionary Council, led by military general Ne Win. The national government consisted of three branches: judicial, legislative and executive. The legislative branch was a bicameral legislature called the Union Parliament, consisting of two chambers, the 125-seat Chamber of Nationalities ( Lumyozu Hluttaw) and the Chamber of Deputies ( Pyithu Hluttaw), whose seat numbers were determined by the population size of respective constituencies.The Constitution of the Union of Burma (1947), Chapter VI: Parliament The 1947 constitution was largely based on the 1946 Yugoslav Constitution, and several Burmese officials visited Yugoslavia earlier that year.DASMIP, PA, 1947, f-124, 425154, Zabeleska o razgovoru druga Price sa predstavnikom burmanske vlade Maung Ohn, dana 5 decembra 1947 godine [Minutes of conversation between comrade Prica and the representative of the Burmese Government Maung Ohn, December 5th 1947]. F. S. V. Donnison, Burma (London: Ernest Benn Limited, 1970), p. 141. =1974 Constitution= Approved in a 1973 referendum, the 1974 constitution was the second constitution to be written. It created a unicameral legislature called the People's Assembly (Pyithu Hluttaw), represented by members of the Burma Socialist Programme Party.The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma (1974), Chapter IV: Pyithu Hluttaw Each term was 4 years. Ne Win became the president at this time. =1988-2008= Upon taking power in September 1988, the military based State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) suspended the 1974 constitution.Liddell, Zunetta (1997) \\"No Room to Move: Legal Constraints on Civil Society in Burma\\" (conference paper) 'Strengthening Civil Society in Burma.

The constitutional convention was again called in 2004, but without the NLD. Myanmar remained without a constitution until 2008. 2008 Constitution On 9 April 2008, the military government of Myanmar (Burma) released its proposed constitution for the country to be put to a vote in public referendum on 10 May 2008, as part of its roadmap to democracy. The constitution is hailed by the military as heralding a return to democracy, but the opposition sees it as a tool for continuing military control of the country. The legislative branch is the Assembly of the Union () Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, which is a bicameral legislature consisting of the 440-seat House of Representatives and the 224-seat House of Nationalities. Military (Tatmadaw) member delegates are reserved a maximum of 56 of 224 seats in the National Assembly and 110 seats of 440 in the People's Assembly. This is similar to former Indonesian and Thai constitution. The revisions in state structure, including the creation of self-administering areas were not implemented until August 2010.Xinhua Staff(21 August 2010) \\"Myanmar re-designates areas under new constitution ahead of election\\" People's Daily Online, last accessed 5 October 2010 At the time of its release, foreign media often incorrectly alleged that the constitution barred Aung San Suu Kyi from holding public office because of her marriage to a British citizen; in fact, she would only be barred from the office of President, under the disqualification of those who have a spouse or children who are foreign citizens. There is no similar disqualification for any other public office. =2008 constitutional referendum= On 10 May 2008Ossenova, Katerina (9 April 2008) \\"Paper Chase Newsburst: Myanmar constitution referendum set for May 10\\" Jurist: Legal News and Research, last accessed 5 October 2010 a referendum was held to outline the political framework of the country. According to Chief Justice Aung Toe, who is chairman of the drafting commission, The government did not allow Cyclone Nargis to delay the referendum which took place as scheduled except in the delta areas affected by the cyclone. The National League for Democracy, which is led by Aung San Suu Kyi, was not allowed to participate in the creation of the constitution, and urged citizens to reject the constitution which it labelled as a \\"sham.\\" The referendum itself passed the 2008 Constitution, but was generally regarded as fraudulent by the opposition party and those outside of Burma.Martin, Michael F. (29 April 2010) [\\"Burma‚Äôs 2010 Elections: Implications of the New Constitution and Election Laws\\"] United States Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, last accessed 5 October 2010 =2012 by-elections= In spite of its earlier opposition to the 2008 constitution, the NLD participated in the 2012 by-election for 46 seats and won a landslide victory, with Aung San Suu Kyi becoming a member of parliament, alongside 42 others from her party. =Amending process= The ruling party and opposition parties have acknowledged that amendments are needed. The 2008 constitution reserves 25% of seats in parliament for members of the military, with the most powerful posts given to active-duty or retired generals. =Content of Constitution= The Myanmar Constitution has 15 chapters. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 concern the separation of powers between the legislature, judiciary, and executive. Due to over 50 years of military rule, the Constitution of Myanmar is dominated by the military, with 25% of the seats in both houses of the Assembly of the Union (Pyidaungsu Hluttaw) reserved for military representatives. Proposed changes to most parts of the constitution must be approved by more than 75% of both houses of the Assembly of the Union. For some others it must do so then go to a referendum. When the referendum is held, the changes must be approved by at least 50% of the registered voters, rather than 50% of those voting.No Constitutional Amendments Before Election: Shwe Mann The Irrawaddy, 18 November 2014 A 194-page booklet containing the text in Burmese and English is available to download.

The building currently serves as the Capital Research Center headquarters. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and designated a contributing property to the Sixteenth Street Historic District in 1978. Description and history The Robert Simpson Woodward House is located a short way north of Scott Circle, on the east side of 16th Street NW between P and Church Streets. It is a four-story brick building with Romanesque styling, and is not of particular architectural significance. Prominent features include hipped dormers with tile roofing, the entrance recessed under a rounded arch, and the right-side curved window bay that extends to the third floor. The house was built in 1895 and designed by William M. Conley. Robert Simson Woodward lived in this house from 1904 to 1914. He apparently moved frequently in his lifetime, and this building is one of his longest residencies. A native of Michigan, Woodward studied civil engineering at the University of Michigan before landing a job at the United States Geological Survey. In a long and distinguished career, Woodward made substantive contributions to the fields of astronomy, mathematics, surveying, and geology. He was also known as an effective administrator, serving as dean of the Columbia University School of Pure Science before becoming the first head of the Carnegie Institution in 1903.

Career Raised in the town of Corral de Bustos in C√≥rdoba Province, Argentina, Desio began his career in his native country playing for Club Renato Cesarini and Independiente, winning the 1993‚Äì94 Clausura with the latter. He had departed by the time they claimed the 1994 Supercopa Sudamericana, having transferred (initially on loan) to play for Celta de Vigo of Spain's La Liga, whose manager at the time, Carlos Aimar, hailed from the same town. Desio's spell in Galicia outlasted that of Aimar, but in December 1996 he moved to second-tier UD Salamanca where he played only until the end of that season; the team finished as runners-up and were promoted, but Desio would remain at the same level, joining Deportivo Alav√©s. Earning respect for his combative approach and ball-winning abilities, he immediately helped the Basque club achieve their own promotion as winners of the 1997‚Äì98 Segunda Divisi√≥n, and alongside a new arrival with a similar style, compatriot Mart√≠n Astudillo, played regularly as the side coached by Man√© narrowly maintained their status in the top division, qualified for the UEFA Cup and then reached the final of the European competition in successive years ‚Äì Desio made 12 appearances in the continental run, which included the elimination of Inter Milan, and played the entirety of the 2001 UEFA Cup Final which Alav√©s lost 5‚Äì4 to Liverpool. Having missed only 10 league matches in the previous four years, he was absent for almost all of the following campaign with a serious injury to his right knee sustained in a pre-season match in England, and though he made a successful return to the squad in 2002‚Äì03, his involvement was interrupted by two red cards. He retired at the end of that season, aged 33, as the team were relegated. With his spell in Europe lasting nine years, he also acquired Spanish nationality. After retiring as a player, in 2009 Desio became co-ordinator of youth football with his hometown team, Sporting Club de Corral de Bustos, moving on to a similar role at professional club Estudiantes de La Plata in 2013 (working under sporting director and subsequent president, Juan Sebasti√°n Ver√≥n), and in 2017 taking up a post overseeing the underage national squads for the Argentine Football Association, also in collaboration with Ver√≥n. Personal life Desio has two brothers who are also involved in football: Jorge is a fitness coach who has assisted Jorge Sampaoli at numerous managerial roles including the Chilean and Argentine national squads; Carlos is a former player and a coach whose appointments include the national under-17 squad working with Pablo Aimar. His son Gonzalo (born in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain) is also a footballer, trained in the ranks of Estudiantes and involved with Argentina's national youth squads, appearing at the 2018 South American Games.

The house was built around the year 1750, enlarged slightly in 1780, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The house is a very simple one-and-one-half-story, center-chimney cottage set behind stone walls on a large lot at the corner of Diamond Hill Road and Fairhaven Road. The asymmetrical, four-bay facade and slightly offset chimney testify that it was originally built as a half house and then later extended around 1780. The house served as the center of a small farm and cottage industries throughout most of its history. An earlier house on the site is said to have been a blockhouse during King Philip's War 1675‚Äì1677. The Whipple‚ÄìJenckes House was constructed by Samuel Whipple beginning about 1750 when he inherited this property from his father, William Whipple, a direct descendant of John Whipple, one of the area's earliest settlers in the 1600s. At that time, the property also contained an earlier house, which is sometimes referred to in deeds as \\"Samuel Whipple‚Äôs old house\\" and in secondary sources as a \\"blockhouse\\". Its construction date is not known, but it stood immediately northeast of the present house well into the nineteenth century. Diamond Hill Road was one of the area's first primary north-south roads and is described in early deeds as the road between Providence, Rhode Island and Franklin, Massachusetts. Significance The Whipple‚ÄìJenckes House is significant as a well-preserved example of mid-eighteenth-century rural vernacular domestic design, and illustrates the evolution of the half house to a full center chimney form.

In 1970, the company was awarded a NASA contract to produce precision, small- format position transducers for aircraft flight control testing. The successful completion of this contract led to the development and production of a complete line of innovative, small-size position transducers. In 1974, the company was tasked with producing a multi-dimensional \\"swivel head\\" air data probe to enhance total and static pressure accuracy at the high angles of attack associated with rotary wing aircraft. The resulting product, the 100510 air data boom, is used for flight test air data sensing requirements to include STOL, VSTOL, rotary wing, business jet, military transport, and general aviation aircraft. Through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, significantly all U.S., Canadian, and European aerospace companies have used the company's air data products and position transducers in their research, development, and test activities. Often, these products were designed and manufactured to custom specifications. In 1989, the company began its focus on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the development and introduction of the 100400 miniature air data boom. That product use led to the adoption of SpaceAge Control air data products on a broad range of unmanned aircraft to include aerial targets, autonomous vehicles, and experimental vehicles. Also in 1989, a single auto racing team began using these position transducers to monitor throttle movement and suspension travel. This use resulted in the adoption of the products in automotive test and measurement projects including anthropomorphic dummy instrumentation, impact testing, and control verification.

It participates in the Species Survival Plan for the Mexican wolf. Features Notable species at the zoo include the White Sands pupfish, the Mexican wolf, the Hawaiian goose, and the Ring-tailed Lemurs. The zoo is a Species Survival Plan Captive Facility for the Mexican gray wolf, and in 2006 there were two wolves resident in the zoo. Three Mexican gray wolf pups were born at the zoo in 1994, and seven in 1995. The zoo receives birds of prey that have been injured and are non-releasable. Some special exhibits include a lemur exhibit, a birds of prey exhibit, and a butterfly garden. Several programs operate in the Educational Center, including an Eco-Ranger Junior Zookeeper program. The center is also open to the public for viewing videos and reading books from the collection. Some animals are housed in the center. History The zoo was created in 1898 at its present location at the south end of Alameda Park to entertain train passengers while they waited for the train to refuel. In the early days the zoo received gifts of exotic pets such as raccoons, skunks and birds from local residents. Cages in the early days were made of chain-link fencing, and these were gradually replaced beginning in the 1970s and 1980s. The zoo went into decline in the 1970s, and in a 1987 interview the zoo director said that in the mid-70s \\"the zoo was a dilapidated menagerie\\". The zoo had become a hangout for loiterers and drug dealers, and the city was faced with a decision to either shut down the zoo or upgrade it. They chose to upgrade, and a perimeter fence was added in 1986 to control access. The zoo is sometimes claimed to be the \\"oldest zoo west of the Mississippi\\". However, there are several older zoos, including * Oregon Zoo (founded 1887) * Dallas Zoo (founded 1888), * Henry Doorly Zoo (Omaha, founded 1894) * Denver Zoo (founded 1896) Even the more modest claim that Alameda Park Zoo is the oldest zoo in the Southwestern United States depends on the definition of Southwest, as Denver and Dallas are sometimes considered to be in the Southwest.

The first lightcurve was already obtained in 1974, by Swedish astronomer Claes-Ingvar Lagerkvist at Uppsala Observatory from photographic photometry, but it was only fragmentary and gave a tentative period of 12 hours (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, √ìgyalla measures between 26.59 and 36.11 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.064 and 0.10 (without preliminary results). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) derives an albedo of 0.0916 and a diameter of 33.31 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.6. CALL also classifies it as a stony S-type asteroid (as it does with all Themistians).  Naming  This minor planet was named for the Hurbanovo Observatory (IAU code: 551; formerly known as O'Gyalla Observatory), a seismological, meteorological and astronomical observatory in the former Hungarian city of √ìgyalla. Since 1948, the city belongs to Slovakia and is now known as Hurbanovo. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

Due to the extraordinary faculty invited to teach and the exceptional talents admitted to the school, the International Piano Academy Lake Como has imposed itself as one of the major piano academies in the world in its ten years of activity. Despite the name, the atmosphere is more familial than that of an academy, and communal rather than competitive. The Academy is housed in a beautiful 17th century palazzo overlooking Lake Como. Away from the pressures of the outside world, students are able to learn and work in a relaxed, stimulating and contemplative environment. Here they receive inspiration, opportunities and guidance in every aspect of concert and artistic life, including chamber music, accompaniment, physiology (the treatment/prevention of occupational injuries) and piano technique.

Henr√≠quez claimed to have been victorious, but the official result showed PRI candidate Adolfo Ruiz Cortines to be the winner.

It is situated on the heights of Sillery and run by a team of Marist Fathers and laymen. History It is in 1929 that the Marists Fathers founded the Seminary.In this article, \\"Seminary\\" is used as the literal translation of \\"S√©minaire\\" and does not signify that this high school is a clerical institution. They brought it on an old educational tradition of more than a century. Established at first as an apostolic school, the Seminary widened its objectives and opened more widely to the public in the middle of the 1960s. In 1986, the social changes and the evolution of its clientele brought the school to accept only external students. In autumn, 1990, with the opening of every year of the secondary to the girls, the Seminary admits in its walls all the young people of the region who look for its services for an intellectual, human and Christian quality formation. In June 2002, the Seminary inaugurated a new building which allowed the school to meet the needs better, by being equipped with specific infrastructures for the plastic arts, the music and the artistic production. In 2004, new spaces are fitted out with the repair of the facade of the main building. Then, in May 2007, the addition of a second gym and a training room comes to reaffirm the place granted to sports and health within the Seminary. In 2011‚Äì12, new classrooms were added above the first gymnasium; thus making space for more students. In 2008, the principal of the Seminary Jean Blais retired and was replaced in August by Jean-Fran√ßois Bussi√®res. There was now three principals at school, one for pedagodical services, one for student services and one for general services. In 2017 Bussi√®res decided to retire and was then replaced by Fran√ßois Sylvain and in 2018 Tousignant decided to retire too probably because of the school's scandal in 2018 because he didn't want to be involved with all that stuff. Today there is only one remaining Marist Father working at the school and it is P√®re Jean Martel, s.m. In May 2018, 6 male students were arrested for sharing explicit photos of minors.

They acted as guides, translators, or porters and in this role were also called yanakuna, particularly within the old Inca Empire and Chile. The term was also used for formations composed of indigenous warriors or Indios amigos (friendly Indians), which they used for reconnaissance, combat, and as reserve in battle. The auxiliary Indians remained in use after the conquest, during some revolts, in border zones and permanent military areas, as in Chile in the Arauco War.  History  The formations of auxiliary Indians arose commonly from alliances established by the Spaniards, exploiting ethnic and tribal antagonisms that they found during their occupation of the territory they were attempting to conquer. Hern√°n Cort√©s was one of the first captains who was known to strengthen his columns with these natives. Commonly after the conquest these auxiliary Indians were divided among the settlers of the territories already conquered. They often constituted the most numerous group of the conquerors' followers: =Fall of Tenochtitlan= During Hern√°n Cort√©s' campaign against the Aztecs from 1519 to 1521, he supplemented his meagre force of Spanish soldiers (numbering some 1,300) with hundreds of thousands of native auxiliaries, from various states such as Tlaxcala. During the final siege of the Aztec capital city of Tenochtitlan Cort√©s, according to the account of one of his soldiers, Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, had some 200,000 Tlaxcallan and other native auxiliaries, while the Aztec warriors drawn from the numerous cities surrounding Lake Xochimilco in the Valley of Mexico numbered more than 300,000. =Guatemala= The expedition of Pedro de Alvarado to Guatemala was composed of 480 Spaniards and thousands of auxiliary Indians from Tlaxcala, Cholula and other cities in central Mexico.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Lovell 2005, p. 58. Matthew 2012, pp. 78-79. In Guatemala the Spanish routinely fielded indigenous allies; at first these were Nahua brought from the recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard on the field of battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly decisive.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 16. Some newly conquered Maya groups remained loyal to the Spanish once they had submitted to the conquest, such as the Tz'utujil and the K'iche' of Quetzaltenango, and provided them with warriors to assist further conquest.Carmack 2001, pp. 39‚Äì40. In 1524, fresh from his victory over the Tz'utujil, Pedro de Alvarado led his army against the non-Maya Xinca of the Guatemalan Pacific lowlands.Letona Zuleta et al., p. 5. At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec.Letona Zuleta et al., p. 6. The Mam fortress of Zaculeu was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of Pedro de Alvarado,Gall 1967, p.39. in 1525, with 40 Spanish cavalry and 80 Spanish infantry,Lovell 2005, p. 61. and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies.Carmack 2001, p. 39. When the Spanish besieged the Ixil city of Nebaj in 1530, their indigenous allies managed to scale the walls, penetrate the stronghold and set it on fire. Many defending Ixil warriors withdrew to fight the fire, which allowed the Spanish to storm the entrance and break the defences.Lovell 2005, p. 65. =Peru and Chile= * During the siege of Cuzco, Francisco Pizarro had 200 Spaniards and 30,000 native Chankas, Huancas, Ca√±aris and Chachapoyas. * The column of Diego de Almagro, who went into Chile, had 500 Spaniards, 100 African slaves and about 10,000 auxiliary Indians. * In the case of the conquest of Chile by Pedro de Valdivia, the original group who left Cuzco included 11 Spaniards and 1,000 auxiliary Indians. =Colonial Period after the Conquest= After the initial conquest, most of these allies were considered less necessary and, sometimes, a liability. At times they were needed for defense of the extended Spanish Empire. They were incorporated into the military forces of the Empire, forming their own units, organised along European models under their own names, such as Compa√±√≠as de Indios Nobles (\\"Companies of Noble Indians\\"). The necessity of defence came from either European threats like the Caribbean buccaneers and pirates or American threats such as the Chichimeca, Apache or Comanche tribes or the protracted Arauco war. These units fought in the independence wars.Mart√≠nez La√≠nez and Carlos Canales 2009.

It details the creation of director Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 thriller Psycho. The 2012 American biographical drama film directed by Sacha Gervasi, based on this non-fiction book is titled Hitchcock. The film was released on November 23, 2012. The book was first published on April 15, 1990, by Dembner Books, and distributed by W. W. Norton & Company. Stephen Rebello researched the film thoroughly through Hitchcock's personal records and archives and he interviewed virtually every surviving cast and crew member. Prior to the book's publication, Rebello's initial research appeared as a 22-page article in the April 1986 issue of Cinefantastique magazine entitled \\"Psycho: The Making of Alfred Hitchcock's Masterpiece\\". That research was expanded for the book version. Synopsis The book details Hitchcock's acquisition of the original novel by Robert Bloch to his work with two different screenwriters, casting, filming, editing, scoring, and promotion. Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho shows the daily lives of the filmmakers, who believed they were making a modestly budgeted, black-and-white shocker, representing a radical departure from the elegant, suspenseful films that had made director Hitchcock's reputation, including Rope, Rear Window, To Catch a Thief, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and North by Northwest. The project, which Hitchcock tackled in part to compete with financially successful, low- budget, youth-oriented horror movies, went on to astound many by becoming a cultural watershed, an international box-office success, a film classic, and a forerunner of the violent, disorienting films and real-events of the turbulent 1960s and '70s. Publication history Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho was initially distributed in hardcover print by W.W. Norton for Dembner Books on April 15, 1990, in the United States. A trade paperback edition was released in the United States in 1998 by St. Martin's Griffin. Subsequently, the book has been published in hardcover and paperback by Marion Boyars Limited in Great Britain and Australia. It has also been published in translated international editions in Japan by Byakuya Shobo, France, Germany, and in Italy by Il Castoro. The book has since become a standard and continues to be used in film studies classes on director Alfred Hitchcock. In 2010, Open Road Media launched the first e-book version of the book, which in 2013 was re-published in a motion picture tie-in edition in the U.S.. The book has been re-published in early 2013 in the England, Italy and Japan, as well as published for the first time in Brazil, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Korea, and China. Blackstone Audio in 2013 released an unabridged audiobook narrated by Paul Michael Garcia and, subsequently, by Richard Powers. Critical reception The book received considerable praise upon its publication as well as in subsequent years for reprints. On the publication of the hardcover first edition in 1990, critic Richard Schickel called the book \\"indispensable and marvelously readable\\" and \\"one of the best accounts of the making of an individual movie we've ever had.\\" Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times declared it a \\"meticulous history of a single film production.\\" Anthony Quinn in The Sunday Times wrote; \\"[the book] combines a gossipy retrospective with a serious work of criticism, presenting an articulate guide to Hitchcock's idiosyncratic approach to film-making and the collaborative efforts that underpinned it. The author has conducted interviews with all those involved in the making of Psycho ‚Äì its casting, scripting, art design, lighting, editing, selling ‚Äì in the course of it, we inch closer to the bizarre, unpredictable quality of its director.\\" The critic for Newsweek called the book \\"wonderful\\" and observed, \\"Stephen Rebello makes reading about Psycho almost as much fun as watching it.\\" Psycho star Anthony Perkins called the book, \\"Meticulously researched and irresistible ... Required reading not only for Psycho-philes, but for anyone interested in the backstage world of movie-creation.\\" Images Journal reviewer Gary Johnson called it \\"one of the best books ever written about the making of a movie.\\" Gerald Kaufman of The Sunday Telegraph found it \\"joyously entertaining.\\" Entertainment Weekly, referring to Rebello's revealing how Hitchcock arrived at the sound of the knife stabbing the heroine in the shower, opined \\"the melon tale alone is worth the price of [the book].\\" Another top critic wrote that, unlike other books about films and filmmakers, it \\"reads more like a gripping novel than detached intellectualism.\\" In a January 6, 2010 Newsweek story called \\"The Mother of All Horror Films,\\" Malcolm Jones called the book \\"fascinating\\" and Robert Graysmith, true crime author of the non-fiction book Zodiac, termed the book \\"groundbreaking.\\" Leonard Maltin, in his \\"Movie Crazy\\" blog entry of October 29, 2010, called the book a \\"landmark.\\" In 2012, a writer for The Hollywood Reporter declared the book \\"a masterpiece about a masterpiece.\\" The Guardian critic John Patterson called the book \\"enthralling\\" and, on February 1, 2013, in The Guardian described the book as \\"revelatory.\\" Wrote David Pitt of Booklist: \\"There are a handful of Hitchcock biographies‚ÄîDonald Spoto‚Äôs The Dark Side of Genius and Patrick McGilligan‚Äôs Alfred Hitchcock, among them‚Äîbut here, though focusing on a single film, Rebello offers a close-up look at the director that is perhaps more revelatory about the man‚Äôs character and working style than any full-length biography.

Official investigations in both Britain and France found that Diana died in a manner consistent with media reports following the fatal car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. In 1999, a French investigation concluded that Diana died as the result of an accident.Paul Webster and Stuart Millar \\"Diana verdict sparks Fayed appeal\\", The Guardian, 4 September 1999 The French investigator, Judge Herv√© Stephan, concluded that the paparazzi were some distance from the Mercedes S280 when it crashed and were not responsible.Martyn Gregory \\"Stranded on Planet Fayed\\", The Spectator, 27 June 2007 After hearing evidence at the British inquest, a jury in 2008 returned a verdict of \\"unlawful killing\\" by driver Henri Paul and the paparazzi pursuing the car. The jury's verdict also stated: \\"In addition, the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased were not wearing a seat belt and by the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else\\".Scott Baker's hearing transcipts at the verdict Prominent in disputing the official version of events have been the British newspaper Daily ExpressTina Brown The Diana Chronicles, Random House, 2007, p.406Louise Jack \\"The Express' and Diana: Cover-ups, spies and conspiracies\\", The Independent, 18 December 2006 and Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, whose son, Dodi, was Diana's boyfriend at the time and also died with her in the crash. In 2003, Diana's butler Paul Burrell published a note that had been written by Diana, in which she had claimed that someone was \\"planning 'an accident' in [her] car, brake failure and serious head injury\\" so that her former husband could marry again. A special Metropolitan Police inquiry team was established in 2004, Operation Paget, headed by Commissioner John Stevens to investigate the various conspiracy theories which led up to the British inquest. This investigation looked into 175 conspiracy claims that had been made by Fayed.Martyn Gregory \\"Al-Fayed can't rewrite the death of Diana\\", The Independent, 7 October 2007 Fayed has persistently suggested what were found to be conspiracy theories at the inquestGordon Rayner \\"Coroner: No evidence Diana was murdered\\", telegraph.co.uk, 31 March 2008Stephen Bates \\"No evidence Diana killed by MI6, coroner tells jury\\", The Guardian, 1 April 2008 and has repeatedly claimed that he believes his son was murdered with Diana.\\"Diana murdered, Al Fayed claims\\", BBC News, 18 February 2008 Henri Paul =Security service connections= Theorists have alleged that the driver of the Mercedes-Benz, acting head of Ritz security Henri Paul, was in the pay of a national security service, though different versions of the allegation name the country of the security service alternately as Britain, France or the United States. Evidence purported to support this arises mainly from money in his possession at the time of his death and his personal wealth. These allegations are covered in chapter four of the Operation Paget criminal investigation report. Mohamed Al-Fayed claims that Henri Paul was working for MI6 and that they set him up. The inquiry found no evidence Henri Paul was an agent for any security service. =Blood samples= Another allegation concerns the reliability of blood tests carried out, which indicated Paul had been drinking before he took the controls of the car. The French investigators' conclusion that Paul was drunk was made on the basis of an analysis of blood samples, which were said to contain an alcohol level that (according to Jay's September 1997 report) was three times the French legal limit. This initial analysis was challenged by a British pathologist hired by Al-Fayed. In response, French authorities carried out a third test, this time using the more medically conclusive vitreous fluid from inside the eye, which confirmed the level of alcohol measured by blood and also showed Paul had been taking antidepressants. It has been claimed that the level of alcohol reported to have been found in Paul's blood was inconsistent with his sober demeanour, as captured on the CCTV of the Ritz that evening.\\"Q&A;: What really happened\\", BBC News, 8 April 2008 Professor Robert Forrest, a forensic pathologist, said that an alcoholic like Paul, with a higher tolerance for alcohol, would be able to appear more sober than he actually was.Martyn Gregory Diana: The Last Days, p.122Clive Myrie \\"A tragic end to a day in Paris\\", BBC News, 7 April 2008 The families of Dodi Fayed and Henri Paul did not accept the findings of the French investigation. It was disclosed in November 2006 that Lord Stevens had met with Paul's elderly parents telling them that their son was not drunk.Andrew Alderson \\"Stevens faces grilling over Diana's driver\\", telegraph.co.uk, 10 February 2008 Just prior to Stevens's appearance at the inquest, a source close to Stevens stated that this inconsistency could be explained as him being \\"considerate\\" and \\"sensitive\\" towards the elderly couple, an assessment Scott Baker suggested might be credible in his opening comments to the jury.Paul Cheston and Robert Jobson \\"Stevens must explain 'drunk'U-turn\\", Evening Standard, 3 October 2007 Under cross-examination at the inquest in February 2008, Stevens denied \\"deliberately misleading\\" Paul's parents and said that the chauffeur's condition at the time of the crash did not match the police's definition of being drunk, which he said relied upon someone's physical responses.\\"Lord Stevens demands apology for Al Fayed allegations 'that he failed to properly investigate Diana's death'\\", Evening Standard, 15 February 2008 Stevens said that the available evidence suggested Paul had consumed only two alcoholic drinks, but this was not necessarily all that Paul had consumed, and that he was indeed \\"under the influence\\" of alcohol at the time of the crash. An expert cited in the report estimated that Paul had drunk the equivalent of five measures of Ricard, his favourite liquorice-flavoured French aperitif, before driving. In the two French TOXLAB tests, Paul was found to have 12.8% carbon haemoglobin saturation, a combination of blood's iron-carrying pigment and carbon monoxide. A smoker normally has about 10%, so the result was not unusual.Martyn Gregory Diana: The Last Days, Random House, 2010, p.74 Paul had been smoking small cigars, Cigarillos, in the hours before the crash.\\"A tender touch, minutes before death drive\\", The Scotsman, 5 October 2007 Another test, backed by the opponents of the official findings, showed Paul had 20.7% in his blood at the time of death; if accurate, the rate of dispersal of carbon monoxide from the bloodstream would have meant that Paul's blood had 40% saturation a few hours earlier, and he would scarcely have been able to function at all. On 9 December 2009, it was reported that DNA samples confirm the blood samples with high alcohol levels were indeed from the driver. This was established by a comparison with samples provided by Paul's parents, demonstrating that the blood tested was that of Henri Paul and that he had three times the French legal limit of alcohol in his blood. Tomlinson's allegation of MI6 involvement Richard Tomlinson, a former MI6 officer who was dismissed from the intelligence services and later served five months in prison for breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989,\\"Richard Tomlinson and the Big Breach\\", MI5 website claimed in a sworn statement to the French inquiry in May 1999 that Britain's MI6 had been involved in the crash, suggesting that the security service had documentation which would assist Judge Stephan in his inquiry.\\"Tomlinson deposition\\" , Inside News website (Switzerland) The previous August, he had been reported by the BBC to have claimed that Paul was working for the security services and that one of Diana's bodyguards, either Trevor Rees-Jones (now known as Trevor Rees) or Kes Wingfield, was a contact for British intelligence.\\"Ex-spy speaks to Diana inquiry\\", BBC News, 28 August 1998 Tomlinson alleged that MI6 was monitoring Diana before her death, had told Mohamed Al-Fayed that Paul was an MI6 agent,\\"MI6 'Diana-style' plot dismissed\\", BBC News, 13 February 2008 and that her death mirrored plans he saw in 1992 for the assassination of then President of Serbia Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, using a strobe light to blind his chauffeur.Nick Allen \\"Diana inquest: MI6 'plotted tunnel murder'\\", The Telegraph, 12 February 2013 On 13 February 2008, Tomlinson told the inquest that he may have misremembered and that he had no evidence that Paul was an MI6 agent, but he had said in the previous day's court session that Paul was supplying MI6 with information. Speaking by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he \\"could not remember specifically\\" whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milo≈°eviƒá, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. The Operation Paget Inquiry was given unprecedented access to the offices of both MI5 and MI6 to investigate Tomlinson's claims. It was later revealed that the mentioned memo was a proposal written in March 1993 to assassinate another Serbian figure if he gained power, not Milo≈°eviƒá. Furthermore, the plan didn't involve anything about using flashlights. Further evidence discrediting Tomlinson's claims was found in drafts of a book he was writing about his time in MI6 before he was jailed in 1998 for breaching the Official Secrets Act. The draft, dating from 1996, referred to the memo and contained none of the detail about a staged car crash with flashlights in a tunnel. The inquest was later told by an anonymous MI6 manager (referred to during proceedings as \\"Miss X\\") that MI6 weren't keeping any file on either the Princess or Dodi, and that there wasn't any plan involving them. The inquiry concluded by dismissing Tomlinson's claims as an embellishment. It went on to comment that this embellishment was largely responsible for giving rise to the theories Diana was murdered. Tomlinson was arrested by French authorities in July 2006 as part of their inquiry into the death of Diana. French police were also reported to have seized computer files and personal papers from his home in Cannes. Relationship with Dodi Fayed One of the main motives which has been advanced for alleged murder includes suggestions Diana was pregnant with Mohamed \\"Dodi\\" Fayed's child and the couple were about to get engaged. The alleged dislike of the idea of a non-Christian within the British Royal Family meant such a relationship between the mother of the future king and a prominent Egyptian Muslim would not be tolerated. In Mohamed Al-Fayed's view, which he repeated in court at the inquest in February 2008, Prince Philip, the Prince of Wales, Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and numerous others were all involved in a plot to kill the Princess and his son.Stephen Bates \\"They're all guilty? 'Definitely.' Fayed gets his day in court\\", The Guardian, 19 February 2008 Jeffrey Steinberg of the Executive Intelligence Review, a publication of the American Lyndon LaRouche movement, has also put forward theories that the Princess of Wales was murdered by the security services under the instructions of Prince Philip.John David Bausch \\"Executive Intelligence Review\\" in Peter Knight (ed.) Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia, Santa Barbara, California: ABC-Cliio, p.246 An article in The Daily Telegraph in 1998 reporting the EIR conspiracy theories alleged earlier links between the EIR and Al-Fayed,Ambrose Evans Pritchard \\"US cult is source of theories\\", The Daily Telegraph, 4 June 1998 while Francis Wheen reported the following year that Al-Fayed's spokesman had advised journalists to contact Steinberg.Francis Wheen \\"Francis Wheen on: conspiracy theories, Blair and Clinton vs Slobodan, and Labour's lucky escape\\", The Guardian, 19 May 1999 Al-Fayed made the assertion in television interviews that the couple were going to announce their engagement on the Monday after the accident, 1 September 1997. Operation Paget commented that an announcement of such magnitude from the Princess of Wales would have been a substantial media event of worldwide interest and would have required significant preparation. No evidence was found that any such preparation had been made. CCTV evidence shown at the inquest indicates that Dodi left Alberto Repossi jewellers on the 30 August with nothing more than a catalogue.Gordon Rayner and Richard Holt \\"Princess Diana jury shown CCTV footage\\", telegraph.co.uk, 3 October 2007 Repossi said in 2003 that the ring had been placed on Diana's finger in a St Tropez hotel, and was being resized for future collection in Paris, but later admitted to writer Martyn Gregory that he had received \\"legal papers\\" from Al-Fayed, a client for more than 20 years. Al-Fayed said the couple chose the ring in Monte Carlo, and Dodi had picked it up in Paris the day before he died after it had been altered. This statement of Al-Fayed was contradicted by the statements of Claude Roulet, a shop assistant, and the CCTV footage.Operation Paget Report, pp. 54-78 A CCTV recording demonstrated that a ring had been selected by a Ritz hotel official. It was bought by Mohammed Al-Fayed after the couple's death. A few hours before the accident, on the afternoon of 30 August, Diana's journalist friend Richard Kay received a call on his mobile phone from Diana in which she asked about what was likely to appear in the following day's Sunday papers about her.Tina Brown The Diana Chronicles, p.17 During this call, she made no mention of any announcement she intended to make.\\"No paparazzi conspiracy to kill Diana - and journalists deny she wanted to marry Dodi\\" , Press Gazette, 16 December 2006 More revealing was the statement given by Diana's eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who testified that in a phone conversation with Diana on Friday 29 August, Diana spoke about Dodi Fayed in a manner that gave her sister the impression the relationship was on \\"stony ground\\".Operation Paget Report, page 26 Statements from other friends and confidantes Diana spoke to in the week before her death, including her butler Paul Burrell, her friend Lady Annabel Goldsmith, and her spiritual adviser Rita Rogers, were unanimous that she was firm about not wanting to get engaged or married to anyone at that point in her life. A week before she died, the princess had told Goldsmith: \\"I need marriage like a rash on my face.\\" Diana's former private secretary, Patrick Jephson, said to the BBC in reaction to the publication of the Operation Paget Report in December 2006 that her facial expression in the CCTV footage of her at the Paris Ritz on her final evening with Dodi Fayed was one she would wear when she was disgruntled with a situation. However, CCTV images released on 6 October taken just minutes before their deaths, show a relaxed Diana and Dodi affectionately holding hands. An inquiry witness was Hasnat Khan, a Muslim heart surgeon of Pakistani origin based in London, who had a relationship with Diana for two years. Diana had explored the possibility of marriage with him. This had been met with no opposition from the Royal Family and Prince Charles had given his blessing.Angela Balakrishnan \\"Pregnancy rumours, MI6 plots and Henri Paul\\", theguardian.com, 7 April 2008 Khan stated that he had received some racist hate mail from members of the public because of the relationship but had no reason to take what was said in this hate mail seriously. He also stated that he felt the relationship was not opposed by the Royal Family or any other branch of the British Government including the security services. Paul Burrell stated that Diana was still not over her break-up with Khan at the time of her death.Operation Paget Report, pp. 121-129 It was also pointed out that Dodi and Diana had only met just under seven weeks before the accident, at Al-Fayed's villa in St. Tropez on 14 July, meaning there were only 47 days from their first meeting until the night of the accident. Of those days, their schedules permitted them to be together for an absolute maximum of 35 days. From analysis of Diana's actual movements, it is likely they had spent approximately 23 days together before the accident.Operation Paget Report, pp. 20-25 John Macnamara, a former senior detective at Scotland Yard, headed Al-Fayed's own investigation for five years from 1997. Cross- examined at the inquest on 14 February, he conceded that he had found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy to kill the Princess, or that she was engaged or pregnant at the time of her death, apart from the claims Al-Fayed had relayed to him.Stephen Bates \\"Diana conspiracy theory unravels as Fayed's investigator tells of lies and lack of evidence\\", The Guardian, 15 February 2008 Pregnancy In January 2004, the former coroner of the Queen's Household, Dr. John Burton, said (in an interview with The Times) that he attended a post-mortem examination of the Princess's body at Fulham mortuary, where he personally examined her womb and found her not to be pregnant. In an effort to examine the assertions made by Al-Fayed, Operation Paget had scientific tests carried out on pre-transfusion blood found in the footwell of the seat in the wrecked Mercedes the Princess of Wales occupied at the time of the accident. This blood was found to have no trace of the hCG hormone associated with pregnancy.Operation Paget Report, p. 82 The inquiry also extensively interviewed friends of Diana's who were in close contact with her in the weeks leading up to her death. The evidence obtained from these witnesses was of a very sensitive nature and most of it was not included in Operation Paget's criminal investigation report. However, it was reported that friends said she was in her normal menstrual cycle and there was evidence she was using contraception. Al-Fayed's persistence in asserting Diana was pregnant led him to get members of his staff to tell the media that on their final day together, Diana and his son had visited a villa he owned in Paris to choose a room \\"for the baby\\". While the couple had indeed visited the villa, the circumstances of the visit were exaggerated to say it had lasted two hours and that it was in the presence of a prominent Italian interior designer. A security guard at the villa, Reuben Murrell, felt uncomfortable lying about the matter and sold his story to The Sun stating that the visit lasted just under thirty minutes and was not in the company of any interior designer. He provided stills from CCTV to prove this and said he had been in the presence of Diana and Dodi for the entirety of their visit, with there having been no conversation about them coming to live at the villa. He later resigned from Al-Fayed's employment and initiated an employment tribunal for constructive dismissal after Al-Fayed successfully sued him for breach of contract because of the CCTV images he supplied to The Sun.Operation Paget Report, pages 668-671 Senior members of Al-Fayed's staff made derogatory comments about Murrell and Trevor Rees-Jones in their statements to Operation Paget. In 2004, a Channel 4 documentary, The Diana Conspiracy, claimed that the butler at the villa who, in a June 1998 interview with the ITV documentary Diana: Secrets Behind the Crash, claimed to have shown the couple around with their intent being to live there, was not even present at the villa on that day as he was on vacation. Al-Fayed first claimed that the Princess of Wales was pregnant at the time of her death to the Daily Express in May 2001. \\"If it is true, it is strange that he sat upon this important information for three and a half years,\\" Scott Baker said at the inquest. Absence of CCTV images The absence of CCTV images showing the Mercedes's journey from the hotel to the crash site has been frequently cited as evidence of an organised conspiracy. According to The Independent newspaper in 2006, there were more than 14 CCTV cameras in the Pont de l'Alma underpass, though none recorded footage of the fatal collision. Judge Herv√© St√©phan was appointed as Examining Magistrate in this case on 2 September 1997. On that day, by Judicial Order, he tasked the Brigade Criminelle with identifying all video and photographic images along the route taken by the Mercedes. Lieutenant Eric Gigou of the Brigade Criminelle led the team that carried out that work, initially by retracing the route several times and drawing up a list of possible locations. His report showed that the team identified ten locations of CCTV cameras. None of these had any images relevant to the inquiry, since they were principally security cameras facing the entrances to buildings. Most of the cameras were not maintained by the City of Paris; the owners of the buildings to which they were attached operated them privately. There was a traffic-monitoring camera above the underpass in the Place de l'Alma itself but this was under the control of la Compagnie de Circulation Urbaine de Paris (Paris Urban Traffic Unit). That department closed down at about 11 p.m., had no night duty staff and made no recordings. Officers in the Police Headquarters Information and Command Centre could continue to view the pictures shown by the traffic camera in real time but could not control it. The subject of the CCTV cameras is dealt with in Chapter 5 of the Operation Paget report. It was also found that a photograph that was published in a book by David Cohen Diana, Death of a Goddess and captioned as having been taken just before the car entered the tunnel was in fact taken by a photographer as the car left the back of the Paris Ritz. White Fiat Uno and James Andanson Analysis of the wreckage of the Mercedes revealed it had glancing contact with a white Fiat Uno car which left traces of paint on the Mercedes bodywork. Extensive attempts by the French police to find the vehicle involved were unsuccessful. Although no one had seen the Fiat in the tunnel, some witnesses reported seeing an Uno exiting the tunnel. Mohamed Al-Fayed alleged in his July 2005 statement to Operation Paget, and at other times, that the white Fiat Uno was being used by MI6Gregory, p.140 as a means of causing the Mercedes to swerve and thereby crash into the side of the tunnel. Al-Fayed further alleged that the Fiat Uno was owned by a French photojournalist named Jean-Paul James Andanson, a security services agent according to Fayed, who had photographed Diana while she was at his villa in St. Tropez in July 1997. Andanson's death in May 2000, Al-Fayed claimed, was either due to guilt over what he had done or because he was assassinated by the French or British security services to silence him. Operation Paget found that the white Fiat Uno Andanson owned was in an unroadworthy condition, being nine years old at the time, with 325,000 km on the odometerMartyn Gregory Diana: The Last Days, Random House, 2010, p.129 (suggesting that the car had been driven 27,000 miles per annum) and had not been maintained for several years prior. Andanson's neighbours confirmed the veracity of this evidence. Andanson had sold the car in October 1997.Elizabeth Stewart \\"Diana inquest hears Fiat conspiracy theory\\", theguardian.com, 5 February 2008 Operation Paget concluded it was extremely unlikely due to the car's condition and the fact Andanson had so openly disposed of it that it was the one at the scene of the accident in Paris. French police had examined Andanson's car as part of their effort to trace the one that had come into contact with the Mercedes with a view to prosecuting the driver for failing to render assistance and had reached the same conclusion. The French police spent a year after the accident searching for the vehicle and eliminated over 4,000 white Fiat Unos from their inquiry. Operation Paget decided it would be unlikely renewed enquiries would identify the vehicle involved as such a long period had elapsed since the accident. It concluded the threat of prosecution for a custodial offence probably deterred the driver from coming forward at the time. A retired major in the French Brigade Criminelle, Jean Claude Mules, gave evidence to the inquest in February 2008. Andanson had been interviewed by French police in February 1998, and had been able to provide documentary evidence about his movements on the previous 30 and 31 August which had satisfied them that he could not have been the driver of the Fiat Uno involved. These demonstrated that Andanson could only have been at his home in Lignieres, 177 miles from Paris, at the time of the crash. Elizabeth, his widow, said at the London inquest in February 2008 that her husband had been at home in bed with her at the time of the accident. =Andanson's suicide= Andanson died in May 2000. The official verdict was suicide.Gregory Diana: The Last Days, p.130 His body was found in a black, burnt-out BMW in a forest near the town of Nant, near Millau, in the south of France. Andanson's death was attributed to problems in his private life. The 2008 inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales heard that evidence was uncovered from his friends and associates that prior to his death he had talked of suicide by pouring petrol in a car and lighting a cigar, as noted by Richard Horwell QC, for the Metropolitan Commissioner. The Paget report states that when the car was found, Andanson's body was in the driver's seat of the car, and his head was detached and lay between the front seats. There was a hole in his left temple. The French pathologist concluded this hole was caused by the intense heat of the fire rather than, for example, a bullet wound. Operation Paget found no evidence Andanson was known to any security service and, contrary to Al- Fayed's claims, his death was thoroughly investigated by French police (although the whereabouts of the car keys has never been explained). A break- in at his former workplace in June 2000 alleged to have been carried out by security services was found to be unconnected to his death, as no items related to him were stolen. =Le Van Thanh= It has been reported by numerous publications that the white Fiat Uno belonged to Le Van Thanh who was a 22-year-old taxi driver at the time of the accident. Thanh owned a white Fiat Uno identical to the one that struck the Princess of Wales' Mercedes. Georges and Sabine Dauzonne identified Thanh as \\"the agitated man they may have seen driving the car\\". Thanh has always refused interview requests. In 2006, Thanh's father said his son had re-sprayed his white Uno red hours after the accident, allegedly waking up his mechanic brother in the night to help him. Following tests, it was concluded that the car \\"could have been involved in the accident\\", but Thanh's involvement in the accident \\"was ruled out by French police because he said he was at work on the night in question\\". It was later uncovered that he had left work early that night and could have been at the scene of the crime. Multiple witnesses recall seeing a man matching his description exit the tunnel seconds after the crash. Bright flash An alternative explanation for the cause of the crash has been reports of a bright white flash just before the car entered the tunnel, blinding the driver. Richard Tomlinson made this allegation at the inquiry, but the veracity of his evidence was found wanting. It was found by the authorities that three eyewitnesses at the scene of the crash claimed to see a bright flash of light before the accident.Gordon Rayner \\"Diana witness: crash was like an explosion\\", telegraph.co.uk, 17 October 2007 Fran√ßois Levistre (originally Fran√ßois Levi)Gregory Diana: The Last Day, p.89 made a clear, specific claim that he saw a bright flash, but his three statements to the authorities were in conflict with each other.Martyn Gregory \\"Of course there was no ‚Äòflash before the crash‚Äô\\", The Spectator, 24 October 2007 Both the French detectives investigating after the crashGregory Diana: The Last Days, p.69 and later the officers who worked on Operation Paget rejected his evidence.Gregory Diana: The Last Days, p.143 With the Mercedes behind him, he claimed to have seen the flash in his rear-view mirror and recounted other elements of what he saw while he was negotiating the difficult bend out of the tunnel.James Orr \\"Diana crash witness tells of 'white flash'\\", theguardian.com, 15 October 2007 Crucially, however, his testimony was directly contradicted by his then-wife, who was in the passenger seat next to him. However, eyewitness Brian Anderson, an American tourist, told detectives that he too saw a bright flash. French Police in 1997 were aware of Levistre's conviction in Rouen during 1989 for dishonesty and his subsequent prison sentence, and he was not thought by them to be a reliable witness.How Diana Died: The Conspiracy Files, BBC Two, 10 December 2006 (BBC transcript); \\"How Diana Died: The Conspiracy Files\\"', BBC News, 7 December 2006 Television documentaries produced by Channel 4 in 2004 and the BBC in 2006 both raised this issue; he appeared as a witness at the British inquiry via a video link in October 2007. Diana: Secrets Behind the Crash (3 June 1998), an ITV programme presented by Nicholas Owen, then ITN's Royal Correspondent, gave enough weight to the claims of Levistre that 93% of viewers polled by the Mirror newspaper just after the broadcast believed there had been a bright flash of light at the time of the crash. The detail of eyewitness testimony was thoroughly reviewed and Operation Paget officers succeeded in uncovering two new witnesses. Other eyewitness testimony made little reference to the appearance of any inexplicable flashes at the crash site. Several witnesses who would be expected to have seen a blinding flash made no reference to one. In any event, the detailed crash reconstruction revealed that the chain of events that led to the car unavoidably colliding with the pillar started well before it was at the mouth of the tunnel where the flash is alleged to have occurred. Furthermore, a strobe light of the type that was alleged to have been used is so powerful that a flash emitted from it would have been bright enough to illuminate a very wide area. It would have likely blinded not only Paul, but also the driver of the white Fiat Uno, the pursuing paparazzi and witnesses standing at the road side. The Operation Paget report concluded that the alleged flash did not happen. Seat belt There was some media discussion in April 2006 suggesting that Diana was a faithful seat belt user and therefore the fact that both her and Dodi's seat belts either failed or were not used was sinister and might suggest sabotage. Her sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale later said that Diana \\"was religious in putting on her seat belt\\". Other sources question if she did in fact use her seat belt all the time, as was suggested. \\"What is certain is that she was not wearing a seat belt and this made things worse. We would like to think that if she had been wearing a seat belt, we'd have been able to save her,\\" said Prof. Andr√© Lienhart, who reviewed the emergency services' response for the French government investigation of the incident. CNN did an analysis of the crash in early September 1997 and concluded that injuries would have been minor had the occupants been wearing seat belts. The conclusions were provisional owing to limited data about the specific Mercedes model as the limousine was not sold in the US. Analysis of the wreckage of the car after its repatriation to England in 2005 by a Forensic Accident Investigator from the Transport Research Laboratory of thirty-five years experience on behalf of Operation Paget found that all the seat belts were in good working order except for the right rear one which was attached to the seat Diana occupied. Follow up enquiries with French investigators found that they had declared all the seat belts operational at an examination in October 1998, suggesting the damage to this seat belt took place after the accident. The British inquest verdict explicitly stated that lack of seat belts had \\"caused or contributed to\\" the deaths of both Dodi and Diana. Transport to the hospital The first call to the emergency services' switchboard was logged at 12.26 a.m. The SAMU ambulance carrying the Princess arrived at the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital at 2.06 a.m. This length of time has prompted much conspiracy-related comment. The period between the crash and the arrival at the hospital takes into account the following: the time taken for emergency services to arrive; the time taken by the Sapeurs-Pompiers (fire service) of Paris to remove Diana from the damaged car; and the actual journey time from the crash site to the hospital. Police Officers S√©bastien Dorzee and Lino Gagliadorne were the first emergency officials to arrive at the scene at around 12:30 a.m. Sergeants Xavier Gourmelom and Philippe Boyer of the Sapeurs-Pompiers arrived at around 12:32 a.m. Doctor Jean-Marc Martino, a specialist in anaesthetics and intensive care treatment and the doctor in charge of the SAMU ambulance, arrived at around 12:40 a.m. Diana was removed from the car at 1:00 a.m. She then went into cardiac arrest. Following external cardiopulmonary resuscitation, her heart started beating again. She was moved to the SAMU ambulance at 1:18 a.m. The ambulance departed the crash scene at 1:41 a.m. and arrived at the hospital at 2:06 a.m.--a journey time of approximately 26 minutes. This included a stop at the Gare d'Austerlitz ordered by Dr Martino because of the drop in the blood pressure of the Princess of Wales and the necessity to deal with it. The ambulance was travelling slowly on his express instructions. The doctor was concerned about Diana's blood pressure and the effects on her medical condition of deceleration and acceleration. The SAMU ambulance carrying Diana passed the H√¥tel-Dieu Hospital on the Ile de la Cit√© en route to the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital. The decision to transfer her to the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital was taken by Dr Marc Lejay who was on despatch duty in SAMU Control on that night, in consultation with Dr Derossi, who was at the scene. The Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital was the main reception centre for multiple trauma patients in Paris. The H√¥tel-Dieu was not equipped to deal with the injuries Diana had sustained. Lejay stated: ‚ÄòThe H√¥tel-Dieu hospital on the ‚ÄòIle de la Cit√©‚Äô is closer but not equipped with heart surgery teams or neurosurgical teams or teams trained to take patients with multiple injuries.‚Äô Lejay was also aware that Professor Bruno Riou was on duty at the Piti√©- Salp√™tri√®re that night and was particularly skilled to treat her injuries. Dr Jean-Marc Martino supported this view. Embalming of the body Mohamed Al- Fayed alleged that Diana's body was deliberately embalmed shortly after her death to ensure that any pregnancy test at the post-mortem would produce a false result. Operation Paget found that 31 August 1997 was a very hot day in Paris. Diana's body had been stored in an empty room adjacent to the emergency room where she had been treated at the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital, as the mortuary was on the other side of the hospital grounds and some distance away. Dry ice and air conditioning units were placed in the room to keep it cool but appeared to have had little success.The Operation Paget inquiry report into the allegation of conspiracy to murder Metropolitan Police Service, 2006-12-14, Chapter 9, page 532, paragraph 4, page 538, statement 177: 'Jean Monceau is an experienced embalmer. ... He believed she needed to be embalmed. This was principally for presentation purposes before the Princess of Wales‚Äôs family ...', page 539: 'I suggested arterial injections to preserve the body from the proliferation of bacteria (odours and change of colour), especially given that the heat in the room where the body was, being so high was a contributory factor.' Diana's two sisters and Prince Charles were scheduled to view the body later that afternoon before bringing it back to the United Kingdom. President Jacques Chirac and his wife also wished to pay their respects. This meant there was very little time to prepare the body for viewing, and it was clearly unacceptable to present Diana's body to her family and the President of France in the state it was in. Faced with this situation, the hospital staff decided to press ahead with embalming with only verbal authority from Madame Martine Monteil, the local superintendent of police, who assured Jean Monceau \\"that everything would be in order\\". Under French law, paperwork must be completed before undertaking the embalming of any corpse likely to be subject to a post-mortem. This paperwork was completed, but only after the embalming had been carried out, giving rise to allegations of suspicious circumstances. The allegations were made despite there being no way the hospital staff could have known whether or not Diana was pregnant, as a pregnancy test would have been irrelevant to her post crash treatment and accordingly was not carried out.Operation Paget Report, Chapter Nine SAS The Court Martial of SAS Sniper Danny Nightingale led to a letter written by witness, Soldier N, and sent to his in-laws coming to wider attention. Soldier N, Nightingale's former roommate, was in prison for illegally hiding firearms and ammunition. On 17 August 2013, the Metropolitan Police announced they were reviewing evidence that Soldier N had boasted that the SAS were behind the death of Princess Diana.\\"Report: Princess Diana Death Probe: British Media Reports Allegation That Royal's Death Was No Accident\\", ABC News, 19 August 2013 The parents of Soldier N's estranged wife reportedly wrote to the SAS's commanding officer, claiming Soldier N had told his wife the unit \\"arranged\\" Diana's death and it was \\"covered up\\".\\"Diana letter: were the SAS involved in her death?\\", Channel 4 News, 18 August 2013Sam Marsden, and Ben Farmer \\"Royal bodyguards' shock at claims SAS killed Princess Diana\\", telegraph.co.uk, 18 August 2013 The information was reportedly passed onto Scotland Yard by the Royal Military Police.

At the end of November 2013, Scotland Yard ended its study of the SAS allegations and released a statement: \\"The Metropolitan Police Service has scoped the information and is in the process of drawing up conclusions, which will be communicated to the families and interested parties first, before any further comment can be made,\\"Richard Eden \\"Princes William and Harry to learn 'truth‚Äô of Diana murder claims\\", telegraph.co.uk, 1 December 2013 On 16 December, it emerged from Sky News reports that there was \\"no credible evidence\\" that the SAS was involved in the death of the Princess and the others, and thus no reason to re-open the investigation.Hayley Dixon \\"Princess Diana was not murdered by SAS, Met Police say\\", telegraph.co.uk, 16 December 2013Press Association \\"Diana, Princess of Wales death: no evidence SAS was involved, says Met\\", theguardian.com, 16 December 2013 Conspiracy theories in other media The Murder of Princess Diana is a bestselling 2004 book by British journalist Noel Botham which disputes the official version of events and suggests an orchestrated conspiracy. A fictionalised telemovie adaption, The Murder of Princess Diana was later released. Many people believe that comedian John Mulaney is responsible for the death of Princess Diana since his comedy show New In Town which gave reason to believe that he may be accountable. Unlawful Killing, a British documentary film about the deaths of Diana and Dodi, was shown May 2011 in Cannes, while the 2011 Cannes Film Festival was in progress. It was directed by Keith Allen and funded by Mohamed Al-Fayed. The film was not shown in British cinemas; lawyers for the producers suggested that 87 cuts needed to be made before it could be certified for release. Following its failure to gain insurance against possible legal action, following putative distribution in the United States, the film was shelved in 2012.

Coastal Balasore district was one of the worst-hit areas in the Odisha famine of 1866. The Orissa famine of 1866 affected the east coast of India from Madras northwards, an area covering 180,000 miles and containing a population of 47,500,000;\\"The Orissa famine o 1866\\", by Ganeswar Nayak (PDF) the impact of the famine, however, was greatest in Orissa, now Odisha, which at that time was quite isolated from the rest of India. In Odisha, one third of the population died due to famine. Causes Like all Indian famines of the 19th-century, the Orissa famine was preceded by a drought: the population of the region depended on the rice crop of the winter season for their sustenance; however, the monsoon of 1865 was scanty and stopped prematurely. In addition, the Bengal Board of Revenue made incorrect estimates of the number of people who would need help and was misled by fictitious price lists. Consequently, as the food reserves began to dwindle, the gravity of the situation was not grasped until the end of May 1866, and by then the monsoons had set in. Course and relief Efforts to ship the food to the isolated province were hampered because of bad weather, and when some shipments did reach the coast of Odisha, they could not be moved inland. The British Indian government imported some 10,000 tons of rice, which reached the affected population only in September. Although many people died of starvation, more were killed by cholera before the monsoons and by malaria afterwards. In Odisha alone, at least 1 million people, a third of the population, died in 1866, and overall in the region approximately 4 to 5 million died in the two- year period. The heavy rains of 1866 also caused floods which destroyed the rice-crop in low-lying regions. Consequently, in the following year, another shortfall was expected, and the Government of British India imported approximately 40,000 tons of rice at four times the usual price. However, this time they overestimated the need, and only half the rice was used by the time the summer monsoon of 1867, followed by a plentiful harvest, ended the famine in 1868. In the two years of the famine, the Government of British India spent approximately Rs.9,500,000 on famine relief for 35 million units (i.e. one person per day); a large proportion of the cost, however, was the high price of the imported grain. Effects Lessons learnt from this famine by the British rulers included \\"the importance of developing an adequate network of communications\\" and \\"the need to anticipate disaster\\".Hugh Tinker, South Asia: A Short History, University of Hawaii Press, 1990. 2nd edition. p. 113 Indian Famine Codes were slowly developed which were \\"designed to be put into place as soon as a failure of the monsoon, or other warning-signal, indicated a probable shortage\\".Hugh Tinker, South Asia: A Short History, University of Hawaii Press, 1990. 2nd edition. pp. 113-114 One early success of this new approach was seen in the Bihar famine of 1873-74 when the famine relief under Sir Richard Temple resulted in the avoidance of almost all mortality.Hall- Matthews, David (1996), \\"Historical Roots of Famine Relief Paradigms: Ideas on Dependency and Free Trade in India in the 1870s\\", Disasters 20 (3): 216‚Äì230 The famine also served to awaken educated Indians about the effect that British rule was having on India. The fact that during the Orissa famine India exported more than 200 million pounds of rice to Great Britain even while more than one million succumbed to famine outraged Indian nationalists. Dadabhai Naoroji used this as evidence to develop the Drain Theory, the idea that Britain was enriching itself by \\"sucking the lifeblood out of India\\".

Cindy formed east of the island and became the annual hurricane season's third named storm on August 14\\\\. Due to unfavorable atmospheric conditions, Cindy remained disorganized throughout its journey across the northeastern Caribbean Sea. After attaining maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), the storm began to weaken from an interaction with the high terrain of Hispaniola. It made landfall in the Dominican Republic as a tropical depression on August 16, and dissipated over the territory the following day. Despite its poor cloud structure, Cindy dropped torrential rain over portions of the northeastern Caribbean. The island of Martinique received a record 12 inches (305 mm) of rain over a 24-hour period, causing severe river flooding throughout northern villages and communes. Le Pr√™cheur was particularly devastated by an extensive debris flow, which dragged away entire structures. The storm wrought $19 million (1993 USD) in damage across Martinique, and left two people dead and hundreds homeless on the island. En route to Hispaniola, Cindy affected the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with rough surf and moderate rain. Heavy downpours and flooding killed two people in the Dominican Republic, though the exact extent of the damage there is unknown. Meteorological history The origins of Tropical Storm Cindy can be traced to a tropical wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August 8, 1993. Over the following days, the wave tracked steadily west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic while retaining a distinct cloud pattern on satellite images. Although data from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on August 13 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation, a second mission at 12:00 UTC the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at the lower levels of the atmosphere. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a tropical depression--a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than 39 mph (62 km/h)--and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter. Steered by a mid- to low-level wind flow, the depression continued west-northwest toward Martinique, decelerating in reaction to the island's northern mountain range. Satellite images on the afternoon of August 14 showed the development of a central dense overcast, as greater atmospheric turbulence over the rugged terrain amplified the cyclone's convection; the next reconnaissance flight revealed that wind speeds near the center had increased to gale force. Based on these observations, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Cindy around 18:00 UTC, at which time the cyclone was located over Martinique with winds of 40 mph (65 km). Although Cindy briefly developed a favorable outflow, its upper-level structure debilitated after it moved away from the Lesser Antilles, impeding further development. Over the course of August 15, Cindy's cloud pattern remained disorganized due to unfavorable wind shear; the center of circulation became ill-defined, with the strongest thunderstorms confined to the eastern portion of the cyclone. Despite the unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to strengthen marginally on August 16, attaining peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1007 mbar (hPa; 29.74 inHg), roughly 85 mi (140 km) southeast of Santo Domingo. Shortly after peaking in strength, Cindy began to interact with the mountains of Hispaniola. The high terrain disrupted its circulation, causing it to weaken to a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC on August 16\\\\. The depression made landfall near Barahona, Dominican Republic, with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). It became increasingly diffuse over land, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone on August 17\\\\. The remnants proceeded inland near the border with Haiti and emerged into the Atlantic, where they spread across the Bahamas before dissipating the next day. Preparations When Cindy became a tropical cyclone on August 14, tropical storm warnings were issued for the Lesser Antilles from Martinique northward to the Virgin Islands. A tropical storm watch was posted for Puerto Rico at the time. As Cindy drifted farther north on August 15, the watch for Puerto Rico was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Officials issued flash flood warnings for parts of the island, and about 600 people living in flood-prone areas sought shelter ahead of the storm. Ferry service between Fajardo and the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques was suspended, leaving about 400 passengers stranded for a day. A price freeze was placed on emergency supplies such as wood, nails, batteries, kerosene, and lanterns. On August 15, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Dominican Republic, from Saman√° to Cabo Enga√±o along the northern coast and westward to Isla Beata off the southwestern coast. Thousands of residents stocked up on bottled water, canned goods, and gas, although many stores in and around the capital remained closed for the day. The Santo Domingo International Airport suspended all flight operations on the morning of August 16. The tropical storm warning for the island was discontinued when Cindy made landfall as no more than a weak tropical depression. In Cuba, a storm alert was issued for eastern provinces as forecasters warned of possibly heavy rainfall. Impact =Martinique= On August 14, Cindy passed over Martinique with rough winds and particularly violent rain, amplified by the storm's interaction with the rising terrain. The greatest quantities fell to the northeast of a line between Sainte-Marie and Fort-de-France, with day totals of more than 4 in (100 mm) recorded at every weather station in that region. The highest 1- and 24-hour rainfall rates were observed in Le Pr√™cheur, totaling 5.79 in (147 mm) and 12.0 in (305 mm), respectively. These amounts were well above the September average of 9.29 in (236 mm), making Cindy one of the most extreme rain events in the island's history. A maximum gust of 40 mph (65 km/h) was recorded during the storm, though sustained winds onshore did not reach tropical storm force. Initially, Cindy's brisk winds downed banana trees and power lines across northern Martinique. After hours of continued rain, several rivers‚Äîsuch as the Rivi√®re des P√®res, Rivi√®re Claire and Rivi√®re S√®che‚Äîquickly swelled and overflowed. Severe flooding and mudslides swept through northern villages, submerging homes and destroying roads and bridges. News footage on national television showed \\"cars [being] swept away to sea and buried in mud\\". The Pr√™cheur River, which normally flows at 18 ft3/s (0.5 m3/s), burst its banks upon attaining an exceptional discharge rate of nearly 25,000 ft3/s (700 m3/s). Large amounts of volcanic matter from the riverbed congealed into a massive debris flow, which struck the small commune of Le Pr√™cheur. Reaching heights up to 10 ft (3 m), the sediment engulfed houses and roads, wreaking an estimated ‚Ç£15 million (1993 value; $2.7 million in 1993 USD) in structural damage. Flash floods surged through the village of Grand'Rivi√®re following the overflow of its river, devastating property and drowning one person. Despite recent improvements to its flood defenses, the Rivi√®re Roxelane rapidly topped its banks and inundated much of Saint-Pierre. Farther south, a combination of torrential rainfall and poor storm drains resulted in flood damage to private property and an aquafarm in Le Morne-Vert. In all, Cindy killed 2 people, injured 11, and destroyed more than 150 homes across Martinique. Monetary losses reached ‚Ç£107 million ($19 million), with road damage comprising ‚Ç£68 million ($12 million). After the storm's passage, thousands of people on the island sought refuge in emergency shelters, and about 3,000 residents became homeless. La Capricieuse, a French Navy ship stationed in French Guiana, delivered disaster relief supplies to Fort-de-France; the goods included 250 packages with clothing items, distributed by the Lions Club Association of Saint Barth√©lemy. Unseasonable sea conditions in Cindy's wake hindered local fishers from selling their catch to trading vessels in Petite Martinique. Due to the severity of the flooding in Martinique, waterways and harbors were dredged, and river banks and dykes were reinforced to prevent recurrence. =Other islands in the Lesser Antilles= Minimal effects were felt elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles. In Guadeloupe, the storm dropped rain across southern Basse- Terre Island through August 14-15; a peak total of 9.02 in (229 mm) was recorded at the summit of La Grande Soufri√®re. Wind gusts at Raizet Airport reached 38 mph (61 km/h), just below tropical storm force. A moderate breeze with 28 mph (44 km/h) gusts brushed Dominica, and 1.25 in (32 mm) of rain fell at Canefield Airport within 24 hours of Cindy's passage. Farther south, a weather station in Saint Lucia recorded 1.88 in (48 mm) of precipitation, as well as light winds. As Cindy passed south of the Virgin Islands, unsettled seas caused minor beach erosion along the islands' southern shores, with swells of 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) reported at Saint Croix. Onshore, the island experienced wind gusts to 35 mph (55 km/h) and 1.48 in (38 mm) of rainfall. =Greater Antilles= WPC On August 16, Cindy made its closest point of approach to Puerto Rico, although its center remained well south of the island. Impact from the storm was therefore limited to intermittent downpours and 8 ft (2.4 m) waves along the southern coast. The rough seas caused some minor erosion to beach facilities. According to a report from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a maximum of 5.54 in (141 mm) of rain fell near R√≠o Cerrillos in Ponce; the highest measurement from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) was 4.60 in (117 mm) at Puerto Real in Cabo Rojo. Many other locations received rainfall amounts of 2.0‚Äì4.5 in (50‚Äì115 mm), which flooded some roads and low-lying areas. Cindy brought considerable rainfall to southern and eastern parts of the Dominican Republic, with totals of 4‚Äì10 in (100‚Äì255 mm). Upon the storm's landfall in the country, winds reached 35 mph (55 km/h) in Barahona. The rain filled rivers and caused scattered street flooding, affecting hundreds of houses. In Villa Altagracia, one fatality occurred when a child drowned in flood waters; the final death toll for the country stood at two. There were no reports of damage elsewhere after Cindy's rapid demise over Hispaniola, though its remnants likely produced localized showers in Haiti.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 The 2-8 was originally known simply as \\"The Schweizer Two-Place\\" when it first flew in June 1938. When World War II started, the 2-8 became a military trainer for the US Army, Navy and Marines and all existing aircraft were drafted into military service. After the war they were sold as surplus and quickly became sought after in civil soaring for their structural strength, lightness and their rugged all-metal design. The 2-8 became one of the most popular post war trainers in the United States. Design and development During the 1920s and 1930s gliding was often self- taught or taught in single place sailplanes. An instructor would often coach the student using hand signals from the automobile towing the glider into the air. By the mid-1930s the benefits of having a two-place glider for training were beginning to be recognized by glider instructors. A number of two-place designs were demonstrated in the United States, including the Gross Sky Ghost in 1932, the Funk two-place and the Bowlus-duPont two place, both of which first flew in 1933. In late 1937 the Airhoppers Gliding Club of Long Island, New York approached the Schweizer brothers to see about the design of a Schweizer two-place glider specifically for training purposes. The Schweizer Metal Aircraft Company built the 2-8 prototype over the winter of 1937-1938. The aircraft was completed and first flew in June 1938, in time to fly in the US National Soaring Championships. The first dozen 2-8s delivered went to clubs and individuals and were not certified aircraft at that time. One 2-8 was ordered by the Soaring Society of America for use by their general manager, Henry Wightman, and was flown from the Washington DC area.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, page 69. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. At the time of the sale to SSA, Bob McDowell, the attorney who notarized the bill of sale, indicated to the Schweizers that they should move their manufacturing operation out of their father's barn and relocate to the Elmira, New York area. The Schweizers received the suggestion positively as they needed more space to produce gliders, but they had no money with which to make the move. McDowell convinced Elmira Industries Inc, the local business development corporation, to provide space for the Schweizers on the second floor of the Elmira Knitting Mill Building in return for stock in the company. This resulted in the Schweizer Metal Aircraft Company becoming the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation, with a sale of shares to Elmira Industries, local businessmen and soaring pilots. Orders for 2-8s came in from a group of Bell Aircraft employees, a youth group, a number of gliding schools, as well as several individuals. The 2-8 received type certificate GTC 5 on 28 June 1940. The type certificate is currently held by K & L Soaring of Cayuta, New York. K & L Soaring now provides all parts and support for the Schweizer line of sailplanes. Manufactured aircraft are known as SGS 2-8s while those assembled from factory kits are designated as SGS 2-8A. The 2-8 has a welded steel tube fuselage covered in aircraft fabric. The aluminum wings feature assembly with self- tapping PK screws and very few rivets. Operational history Parris Island, 1942. N3N Canary trainers were used to tow three LNS-1. In April 1941 the Schweizers were contacted by the US Army Air Force (USAAF). The USAAF, impressed by the Luftwaffe's use of gliders to capture the Belgian fortress of Eben-Emael during the campaign of the previous summer, had decided to commence a glider pilot training program. The USAAF was in need of training gliders and the Schweizers offered the SGS 2-8 as the ideal aircraft for the role.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, page 78. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. On 10 August 1941 the AAF issued a statement on the procurement of the 2-8: > \\"What is probably a record in procurement was established in the case of the > contract with the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation of Elmira New York. This > contract, covering three two-place gliders to CAA Class 2 requirements, with > certain modifications, was signed in Washington DC on June 27, 1941. The > first glider under contract has its initial flight test July 2, at Big Flats > Airport, Elmira, New York and is now at Wright Field.\\" In the first part of 1942 Lieutenant General William S. Knudsen of the War Production Board conducted an inspection of the Schweizer factory, still located on the second floor of the Elmira Knitting Mill. He looked at the antiquated plant and instructed the Schweizers to \\"get out of here\\". He was instrumental in the move of the 2-8 production line to a new plant built for Schweizer Aircraft by the Defense Plants Corporation at the soon-to-be completed Chemung County Airport.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, page 85. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. The US Navy and Marine Corps also ordered the 2-8 as a glider trainer. Because the 2-8 was made from aluminum and steel, which were both declared \\"strategic materials\\", a replacement design was needed. The Schweizers designed the SGS 2-12 as a wooden version of the 2-8, incorporating some improvements, such as a lower-mounted cantilever wing to improve instructor visibility. The 2-12 succeeded the 2-8 in production and 114 were produced with the designation TG-3A. =Competitions and records= Ex USAAF Schweizer TG-2 (SGS 2-8) competing in a vintage glider event at Moriarty, New Mexico in 1997 Distance flying in the 2-8 is challenging, given its 23:1 glide ratio and red-line speed limit of just 72 mph (117 km/h). SGS 2-8s were flown in several US national competitions and held a number of records at one time. Records held include a flight to goal from Elmira, New York to Washington, DC, a distance of 373 km (232 statute miles) flown by Bob Stanley and Ernie Schweizer. Dick Johnson set a multi-place distance record of 499 km (310 statute miles) in a 2-8. In May 2008 there were still 23 SGS 2-8s registered in the US along with one 2-8A. Variants ;SGS 2-8 :The basic factory produced model was designated as the SGS 2-8. ;SGS 2-8A :SGS 2-8s assembled from factory kits were accepted as certified aircraft and were designated as SGS 2-8A. They were otherwise identical to the 2-8. ;TG-2 :The production version of the 2-8 for the US Army Air Force was given the military designation of TG-2, indicating \\"Training Glider 2\\". ;TG-2A :The designation of TG-2A was applied to previously produced civilian versions of the 2-8 that were conscripted into USAAF use. The military tracked down all 2-8s in the USA and bought them for military training from their civilian owners. ;LNS-1 :The production version constructed for the US Navy and US Marines was designated as the LNS-1.

Biography  He was born in Comodoro Rivadavia, province of Chubut. His family moves to Buenos Aires when he was 1 year old.https://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/413/Naveira-Virtual- chat-with-Gustavo-and-Giselle/ He played the guitar from age 7 to 20 and studied it at the conservatory for 3 years. He has been dancing since the age of 20. My first steps with dancing occurred unexpectedly when I studied economy in the University of Buenos Aires where there was a course which I attended. There I came to know of my affinity with dancing. Later I studied folk music dancing and enrolled in short courses of classical, modern and Spanish dances. But always it was rather out of curiosity than for a professional interest. https://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/413/Naveira-Virtual-chat- with-Gustavo-and-Giselle/ The first teacher I had was Rodolfo Dinzel. But I learnt things from several milongueros in a not much organized way. An instructor that gave me a lot was Pepito Avellaneda but I cannot leave unmentioned Antonio Todaro and Gerardo Portalea. 'https://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/413/Naveira-Virtual-chat- with-Gustavo-and-Giselle/ He appeared in the tango lesson movie with Sally Potter in 1997 and he formed a group with Fabian Salas and Pablo Veron during preparation for that movie. Later, together with Salas he would begin the Cosmotango organization in which he took part for just a couple of years. He has been dancing with Giselle Anne since approximately 1995. They met in Spain, at Sitges dancing directly together in a show. https://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/413/Naveira-Virtual-chat- with-Gustavo-and-Giselle/ They are known for their intellectual approach to dance as teachers. Together they have 2 kids. Gustavo has also 2 kids, Ariadna and Federico, from previous relationship with Olga Besio. Gustavo and Gisele Anne live in Boulder, Colorado, USA, where they have their own tango studio and teach their famous \\"tango seminars\\" a genuine method that they have created to make the tango dancers improve their dance. They travel and teach tango abroad also, all over the world. From 2010 they organise in Boulder, Colorado an Argentine Tango Festival: BTF (Boulder Tango Festival, around the months of September/October each year.  Relationship with tango nuevo  In 2009 he published programmatic essay New TangoTango, A History of Obsession, Virginia Gift, 2008, (self published, appeared first in 2009) in which he states: There is great confusion on the question of the way of dancing the tango: call it technique, form, or style. The term tango nuevo, is used to refer to a style of dancing, which is an error. In reality, tango nuevo is everything that has happened with the tango since the 1980s. It is not a question of a style... The words tango nuevo express what is happening with tango dancing in general; namely that it is evolving. Tango nuevo is not one more style; it is simply that tango dancing is growing, improving, developing, enriching itself, and in that sense we are moving toward a new dimension in tango dancing...There has been much recent discussion, in the community of tango dancers, on the problem of the embrace, dividing the dance into open or closed style, which is also a matter of great confusion. Open embrace or closed embrace, dancing with space or dancing close, these are all outmoded terms. This is an old way of thinking, resulting from the lack of technical knowledge in past eras. This simple and clumsy division between open and closed is often used by those who try to deny the evolution of the dance, to disguise their own lack of knowledge. Today it is perfectly clear that the distances in the dance have a much greater complexity than a simple open or closed... We have learned, and we have developed our knowledge. The result of this is a dance of greater possibilities, and also of a much more artistic quality.  Tango Legacy  He is probably the teacher that has influenced tango-dance teaching the most, in all its styles and worldwide. He managed to clarify concepts about the structure of the dance. This has allowed many to understand tango dance better and teaching levels have risen considerably thanks to these concepts. He exposed the different uses of the axis and the structure of the turn ('giro'). He managed to translate this structure to the whole dance simplifying it all in 'cruce adelante', 'apertura' and 'cruce atr√°s'. He also managed to clarify the different ways of understanding and explaining changes of directions and he also transmitted the interpretation of rhythmical patterns specially the so-called 'cincopations'. The critics in Bs. As. said: \\"‚Ä¶You could say that three stylistic tendencies contend for supremacy: Urquiza‚Äôs style, Almagro‚Äôs style and Naveira‚Äôs style ‚Ä¶\\" (Clar√≠n 8/8/99, Buenos Aires Argentina). He is also one of the main influences of Chicho Frumboli's beginnings as a tango dancer.

A Voice in the Wind A Voice in the Wind (1993) is the first novel in Francine Rivers' Mark of the Lion Series. The novel follows the lives of Hadassah, a young Jewish girl captured when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and is sold into slavery yet still holds firm to her faith in God; Marcus, a wealthy Roman aristocrat determined to get the most out of life; Julia, Marcus' younger sister, a high-spirited girl who desires to be happy and control her own life who is served by Hadassah; and Atretes, the high chief of a Germanic tribe who is captured and sold to be a gladiator. Throughout the book, readers receive a glimpse of the extreme faith and love Hadassah has for her God, and the way it impacts the people she meets. An Echo in the Darkness An Echo in the Darkness (1994) begins where A Voice in the Wind left off, in the arena where Hadassah is thrown to the lions. A young physician, Alexander, must choose one of the mauled bodies in the arena, so that he can examine it and further his knowledge as a physician. He chooses Hadassah's because she shows signs of life, and it is illegal to examine a dead body. He finds that the lion has struck no vital organs. On a sudden impulse, Alexander saves Hadassah and nurses her back to health. Although she remains crippled, she regains the ability to walk and talk. Meanwhile, Marcus, believing that Hadassah is dead, tries to deal with his grief by travelling to Israel (Hadassah's homeland) and learning about Hadassah's God. As Sure as the Dawn As Sure as the Dawn (1995) is rather a split of A Voice in the Wind than a follow-up of An Echo in the Darkness following the life of Atretes after he won his freedom in the arena. This novel covers the search for his believed dead son, finding him with a widowed Christian woman, Rizpah, and their travels back to Atretes' homeland in Germania. Here a whole new world unfolds as Atretes is confronted with Christianity, loyalty, love, friendship, family and tradition.

A split leap or split jump is a sequence of body movements in which a person assumes a split position after leaping or jumping from the floor, respectively, while still in the air. Split leaps and split jumps are both found in various genres of dance including acro, ballet and jazz dance, and in gymnastics. Split jumps may also serve as a form of exercise, and the term split jump is also commonly used to describe similar body movements in figure skating. __TOC__ Types Some types of split leaps and jumps are named according to the type of split that is performed, while others may use nomenclature associated with specific dance genres. For example, a straddle (sometimes called side) split leap incorporates a straddle split, with legs extended symmetrically to the sides, whereas a grand jet√©, which involves a front split, derives its name from ballet terminology. A stag split leap is a split leap in which one knee is bent, whereas both knees are bent in a double stag split leap. File:Chenxin Liu - Don Quichotte, Kitri - Prix de Lausanne 2010-7 edit.jpgA ballerina performing a grand jet√©. File:NwFusionAngelaLeap.jpgStag split leap. Technique Split leaps and split jumps require significant flexibility and strength. Flexibility and strength are both needed to attain a split position without the aid of external leg support. Also, in order to remain airborne while in the split position, strength is needed to propel the body upward with sufficient kinetic energy to compensate for the loss of vertical momentum that results from raising the legs into a split position while airborne. In dance, the perceived quality of a split leap or split jump depends in large part on the application of various dance techniques. In particular, emphasis is often placed on pointing the feet while airborne, especially during the split, so as to extend the leg lines. Also, proper technique (i.e., best practice) typically calls for straight legs (except in stag variations) and a full split position at the apex of the leap or jump. Ballon, which is the appearance of effortless and weightless movement, is another important aesthetic. Ballet In ballet the leap, called a grand jet√© in ballet terminology begins with a grand battement. Ballet demands that knees are stretched and feet are pointed when performing the jump. One variation of the jump colloquially called the \\"Plisetakaya head kick\\" after Bolshoi prima ballerina assoluta Maya Plisetskaya is a jump with the front leg tilted downward and a full backbend.Eric N.

Reflection Upon the Disputed Traditions or The Perspicacious) is a Hadith collection, by the famous Twelver Shia Hadith scholar Abu Jafar Muhammad Ibn Hassan Tusi, commonly known as Shaykh Tusi. This work is included among The Four Books of Shia Islam. It includes the same subjects as Tahdhib al-Ahkam (lit. Rectification of the Statutes) but in a shorter form. Author Muhammad ibn Tusi, commonly known as Shaykh Tusi, lived during the first half of the 5th century AH. He is the best known jurist and Mujtahid of the Shia. Born in Tus in 385 AH, he lived his early life there. He received primary education in his homeland of Iran, and had higher studies in Baghdad. At the time Baghdad was the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate and a great center of learning. Abbaside rule stretched from Spain and south Arabia to China and from the Mediterranean coast to North Africa. Consequently, Baghdad was a seat of learning and meeting point for scholars and intellectuals from all parts of the world. The greatest personality of this period was Shaykh Mufid who resided in the Shia neighborhood of Karkh in an opulent atmosphere. Shaykh Tusi taught the teachings of Islam in the presence of the great masters such as Shaykh Mufid, Sharif al-Murtaza, Ibn Ghada‚Äôiri, and ibn Abdun. Two authoritative Shia resources, Tahdhib al-Ahkam and Al-Istibsar, were written by Shaykh Tusi. He also authored many works such as Talkhis al-Shafi, al-Muqni fi ‚Äòl-ghayba, al-Ghayba, al-Tibyan fi Tafsir al-Quran, al-Khilaf, al-Mabsut fi fiqh al-Imamiyah. Sayyid Murtada Alam al-Huda (Sharif al-Murtaza) wrote some works on an Imamate called al-Shafi. It was written as a response to the section on Imamte of Mutazili Qadi Abd al-Jabbar‚Äôs al- Mughni. This work summarized by Shaykh Tusi that was titled Talkhis al-Shafi. Background Al- Istibsar is one of the four major Shia collections of Hadith authored by Shaykh Tusi. He authored this book after writing Tahdhib al-Ahkam, when his colleagues asked him to summarize the book and determined traditions which disagree and explain the reconciliation between the two without leaving out anything which was influential. He wrote in the introduction of Al-Istibsar: It does not include many traditions and explanations are brief. Context Al-Istibsar is authored about Hadiths that seemingly are at variance with each other or \\"show discrepancies\\" in their contents. It included three parts.

The highway travels from U.S. Route 195 (US 195) in Colfax to a short concurrency with parent route SR 27 in Palouse before ending at the Idaho state line and becoming Idaho State Highway 6 (SH-6). Prior to 1964, the highway was split between Secondary State Highway 3F (SSH 3F) from Colfax to Palouse and a branch of Primary State Highway 3 (PSH 3) from Palouse to the Idaho state line. Route description SR 272 begins as Canyon Street in Colfax at an intersection with Main Street, signed as US 195. The highway passes Colfax Cemetery before leaving Colfax and traveling northeast along the Palouse River into farmland. SR 272 turns southeast into Palouse, crossing the Palouse River and becoming Church Street before an intersection with Division Street, signed as SR 27. The highway turns south and east onto Echanove Avenue concurrent with SR 27, crossing a Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) rail lube before turning south onto Division Street and splitting off. SR 272 continues east as Main Street and leaves Palouse, traveling northeast over the WSDOT rail line towards the Idaho state line, where the highway becomes SH-6. SH-6 continues east for along the Palouse River towards Potlatch, Idaho. Every year the WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 350 and 2,100 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in Colfax and Palouse. History A road connecting Colfax to Palouse and Potlatch, Idaho was first constructed in the early 20th century and appeared on a 1910 United States Geological Survey map of the Pullman area. The road, following the course of the Palouse River, was later paved between Palouse and Idaho and designated as a branch of PSH 3, while the gravel road between US 195 in Colfax and Palouse was signed as SSH 3F. SSH 3F was later paved in 1955, as the two highways merged to form SR 272 in the 1964 highway renumbering.

He holds a Doctor of Philology, is a full member of the Academy of Sciences of the Tatarstan Republic, and served as a chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Tatar ASSR (Chairman of the republican parliament in the Tatarstan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the former USSR). Zakiev conducted major scientific research in the field of the Tatar Linguistics, T√ºrkology. For Zakiev's fundamental research in syntactic architecture of the Tatar language, academician B.A. Serebrennikov commented: \\"This is the first most full and logically faultless monograph about the syntax of the T√ºrkic languages\\". Zakiev published several hundred scientific works, including thirty-five monographs, brochures, textbooks and instruction manuals for the Tatar language; a history of the Tatar school of T√ºrkologists; and an ethnic history of the Turkic peoples, covering inter- ethnic and interlingual contacts, bilinguality and multilinguality. Zakiev claims that \\"proto-Turkish is the starting point of the Indo-European languages\\", that Sumerian, Ancient Greek, Icelandic, Etruscan and Minoan are languages of Turkic origin, and that the Sumerians, Scythians and Sarmatians were of Turkic origin. These views are generally rejected by the vast majority of scholars (see Pseudo-Turkology) and he has been frequently described as an \\"alternative historian\\" and a \\"militant amateur\\". Zakiev served in a number of higher schools and institutes as a rector, director and department head (KGPI 1967-1986, IJALI 1986-1997), created Departments of Ethnography, Manuscripts and Textology, Lexicology and Lexicography, was instrumental in compiling a Collection of Monuments of History and Culture, and created a Tatar Encyclopedia. He headed the Scientific Commission of the Education Ministry of the Russian Federation for the philological sciences, and is a member of Presidium of AN RT. Zakiev created scientific schools in the fields of language, interethnic and interlingual contacts, bilinguality and multilinguality. Zakiev prepared thirty Ph.D.s and Doctors of Science. Twelve of his pupils became Doctors of Science and professors. Under his guidance the Department of Linguistics in the IJALI created the three-volume Academic Grammar of the Tatar Language, a multivolume Tatar Lexicology.

SR 278 turns south onto 1st Street and leaves Rockford, crossing over Rock Creek and beginning to parallel it east as Hoxie Road to the Idaho state line, where the roadway becomes Idaho State Highway 58, continuing to U.S. Route 95 (US-95). Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 3,100 and 4,100 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in Rockford. History The route of SR 278 was previously Hoxie Road, which was graveled in 1938 and later paved by the 1950s. Hoxie Road was signed as SR 278 in 1991, and no further major revisions have occurred.

In anti-spammer slang, the name is often abbreviated \\"MMF\\". History The original \\"Make Money Fast\\" letter was written around 1988 by a person who used the name Dave Rhodes. Biographical details are not certain, and it is not clear if this was even the person's actual name. The letter encouraged readers of the email to forward one dollar in cash to a list of people provided in the text, and to add their own name and address to the bottom of the list after deleting the name and address at the top. Using the theory behind pyramid schemes, the resulting chain of money flowing back and forth would supposedly deliver a reward of thousands of dollars to the ones participating in the chain, as copies of their chain spread and more and more people sent one dollar to their address. According to the FAQ of the net.legends Usenet news group, Dave Rhodes was a student at Columbia Union College (now Washington Adventist University), a Seventh-day Adventist college in Maryland, who wrote the letter and uploaded it as a text file to a nearby BBS around 1987. The earliest posting to Usenet was posted by a David Walton in 1989, also using a Columbia Union College account. Walton referred to himself as, \\"BIZMAN DAVE THE MODEM SLAVE\\", and referred to \\"Dave Rhodes\\" in his post. The true identity of Dave Rhodes has not been found. A supposed self-published web site by Dave Rhodes was found to be fake. The scam was forwarded over e-mail and Usenet. By 1994 \\"Make Money Fast\\" became one of the most persistent spams with multiple variations. The chain letters follow a rigidly predefined format or template with minor variations (such as claiming to be from a retired lawyer or claiming to be selling \\"reports\\" in order to attempt to make the scheme appear lawful). They quickly became repetitive, causing them to be bait for widespread satire or parody. One widespread parody begins with the subject of, \\"GET.ARRESTED.FAST\\" and the line, \\"Hi, I'm Dave Rhodes, and I'm in jail\\". Another parody sent around in academic circles is, \\"Make Tenure Fast\\", substituting the sending of money to individuals on a list with listing journal citations. Legality The text of the letter originally claimed this practice is \\"perfectly legal\\", citing Title 18, Sections 1302 & 1341 of the postal lottery laws. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service cites Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302 when it asserts the illegality of chain letters, including the \\"Make Money Fast\\" scheme: It also asserts that, \\"Regardless of what technology is used to advance the scheme, if the mail is used at any step along the way, it is still illegal.\\" The U.S. Postal Inspection Service asserts the mathematical impossibility that all participants will be winners, as well as the possibilities that participants may fail to send money to the first person listed, and the perpetrator may have been listed multiple times under different addresses and names, thus ensuring that all the money goes to the same person. In recent years, one avenue that spammers have used to circumvent the postal laws, is to conduct business by non-postal routes, such as sending an email message and instructing recipients to send money via electronic services such as PayPal. While the specific laws mentioned above will only be violated if regular postal mail is used at some point during the process of communication, the sending of chain letters is often prohibited by the terms of service and/or user agreements of many email providers, and can result in an account being suspended or revoked.

The general partner is the financial entity used to control and manage the fund, while the limited partners are the individual investors. The investment managers work at the general partner and are also limited partners. Limited partners collect their return as capital interest. Carried interest, or carry, in finance, is a share of the profits of an investment paid to the investment manager in excess of the amount that the manager contributes to the partnership, specifically in alternative investments (private equity and hedge funds). It is a performance fee, rewarding the manager for enhancing performance.Lemke, Lins, Hoenig and Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds: Regulation and Compliance, ¬ß13:20 (Thomson West, 2013‚Äì2014 ed.). The purpose of the performance fee structure is to ensure managers have \\"skin in the game,\\" i.e., to align manager and investor incentives. The structure also takes advantage of favorable tax treatment in the United States. History The origin of carried interest can be traced to the 16th century, when European ships were crossing to Asia and the Americas. The captain of the ship would take a 20% share of the profit from the carried goods, to pay for the transport and the risk of sailing over oceans. Definition and calculation Carried interest is a share of the profits of an investment paid to the investment manager in excess of the amount that the manager contributes to the partnership, specifically in alternative investments i.e., private equity and hedge funds. It is a performance fee rewarding the manager for enhancing performance. The purpose of the performance fee structure is to ensure managers have \\"skin in the game,\\" i.e., to align manager and investor incentives. The structure also takes advantage of favorable tax treatment in the United States. =Amount and calculation= The manager's carried-interest allocation varies depending on the type of investment fund and the demand for the fund from investors. In private equity, the standard carried-interest allocation historically has been 20% for funds making buyout and venture investments, but there is some variability. Notable examples of private equity firms with carried interest of more than 20% (\\"super carry\\") include Bain Capital and Providence Equity Partners. Hedge fund carry percentages have historically centered on 20%, but have had greater variability than those of private equity funds. In extreme cases performance fees have reached as high as 44% of a fund's profits but is usually between 15% and 20%. The distribution of fund returns is often directed by a distribution waterfall. Returns generated by the investment are first spent to return each investor's initial capital contribution, including the manager. This is not \\"carried interest,\\" because it is a repayment of principal (i.e., not interest). Second, returns are paid to investors other than the managers, up to a certain previously agreed rate of return (the \\"hurdle rate\\" or \\"preferred return\\").\\"Hurdle Rate\\" explained by mergers- acquisitions.org . The customary hurdle rate is 7‚Äì9% per annum. Third, returns are paid to the managers until they have also received a rate of return equal to the hurdle rate (the \\"catch-up\\"). Not every fund provides for a hurdle and a catch-up. Often, returns during the catch-up phase are split with the manager receiving the larger (e.g. 80%) share and the investors receiving a smaller (e.g. 20%) share, until the manager's catch-up percentage has been collected. Fourth, once the manager's returns equal the investor returns, the split reverses, with the manager taking a lower (often 20%) share and the investors taking the higher (often 80%) share. All manager returns above the manager's initial contribution are \\"carry\\" or \\"carried interest.\\" Technically investor returns are also carried interest, but the term is typically used to refer to manager returns only. =Timing= Private equity funds distribute carried interest to managers and other investors only upon a successful exit from an investment, which may take years. In a hedge fund environment, carried interest is usually referred to as a \\"performance fee\\" and because it invests in liquid investments, it is often able to pay carried interest annually if the fund has generated a profit. This has implications for both the amount and timing of the taxes on the interest (discussed below). =Other fees= Historically, carried interest has served as the primary source of income for manager and firm in both private equity and hedge funds. Both private equity and hedge funds also tend to have an annual management fee of 1% to 2% of assets under management per year; the management fee is to cover the costs of investing and managing the fund. The 1%-2% management fee, unlike the 20% carried interest, is treated as ordinary income in the United States. As the sizes of both private equity and hedge funds have increased, management fees have become a more meaningful portion of the value proposition for fund managers as evidenced by the 2007 initial public offering of the Blackstone Group. Taxation Private equity returns are tax-advantaged in several ways. Private equity carried interest is treated as a long-term capital gain for tax purposes in many jurisdictions. Long-term capital gains are returns on financial and other investments that have been held for a certain statutorily determined amount of time before being sold. They are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income to promote investment. Private equity funds' long time horizons allow their returns, including the manager's carried interest, to qualify as long-term capital gains. Manager carried interest can be categorized as capital gains even if the return on the manager's initial investment is higher than the total rate of return for the asset. Furthermore, taxes on the increase in value of an investor or manager's share of the fund are not due until a realization event, most commonly the sale of the fund, occurs. This allows investors to defer taxes for as long as they stay invested in the fund, which is an advantage to the investor. = United States = Treatment of active partners' return on investment as capital gains in the United States originated in the oil and gas industry of the early 20th century. Oil exploration companies, funded by financial partners' investments, explored and developed hydrocarbon resources. The profits generated were split between the explorers and the investors. The explorers' profits were subject to favorable capital gains treatment alongside the investors'. The logic was that the non-financial partner's \\"sweat equity\\" was also an investment, since it entailed the risk of loss if the exploration was unsuccessful. The implication of treating private equity carried interest as capital gains is that investment managers face significantly lower tax burdens than others who would otherwise be in similar income brackets. , the maximum capital gains rate in the United States is 20% (compare the maximum 37% ordinary income rate). The effects of this advantage are only partly mitigated by the alternative minimum tax regime. This has generated significant criticism (see below). Taxes on carried interest are deferred until a realization event due to the difficulties of measuring the present value of an interest in future profits.See, e.g., Campbell v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (8th Cir. 1991). The Internal Revenue Service affirmed this approach in 1993 as a general administrative rule,Revenue Procedure 93-27, 1993 C.B. 343, clarified by Rev. Proc. 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury. and again in regulations proposed in 2005.Prop. Treas. Reg. section 1.83-3(l), 70 Fed. Reg. 29675, 29680-29681, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury (May 24, 2005). Carried interest is tax advantaged in several other ways as well. Private equity and hedge funds are often structured as legal partnerships or other pass-through entities for tax purposes, which reduces taxes at the entity level (compared to corporations). Private equity funds also benefit from the interest deduction. ;Controversy and regulatory attempts Critics of the carried interest system (as opposed to critics of the broader tax systems that affect private equity) primarily object to the ability of the manager to treat their entire return as capital gains, including amounts above and beyond the amount directly related to the capital contributed by the manager. Critics characterize this as managers taking advantage of tax loopholes to receive what is effectively a salary without paying the ordinary 37% marginal income tax rates. This controversy has been ongoing since the mid-2000s. This controversy has increased as the growth in assets under management by private equity and hedge funds has driven up manager compensation. , the carried interest tax regime's total tax benefit for private-equity partners is estimated to be about $2 billion per year up to 14 or 16 billion dollars. On June 22, 2007, U.S. Representative Sander M. Levin introduced , which would have eliminated the ability of managers to receive capital-gains tax treatment on their income. On June 27, 2007, Henry Paulson said that altering the tax treatment of a single industry raises tax policy concerns, and that changing the way partnerships in general are taxed is something that should only be done after careful consideration, although he was not speaking only about carried interest. In July 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department addressed carried interest in testimony before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee.07.11.07 Testimony Solomon on Carried Interest.doc U.S. Representative Charles B. Rangel included a revised version of H.R. 2834 as part of the \\"Mother of All Tax Reform\\" and the 2007 House extenders package. In 2009, the Obama Administration included a line item on taxing carried interest at ordinary income rates in the 2009 Budget Blueprint.. See page 122 of the White House version of \\"A New Era of Responsibility ‚Äì Renewing America‚Äôs Promise\\". On April 2, 2009, Congressman Levin introduced a revised version of the carried interest legislation as . Proposals were made by the Obama Administration for the 2010, 2011, and 2012 budgets. Favorable taxation for carried interest generated national interest during the 2012 Republican primary race for president, because 31% of presidential candidate Mitt Romney's 2010 and 2011 income was carried interest. Billionaire Warren Buffett, who also benefits from the capital gains system, famously opined that he should not be paying lower taxes than his assistant. On May 28, 2010, the House approved carried interest legislation as part of amendments to the Senate-passed version of . On February 14, 2012, Congressman Levin introduced . On February 26, 2014, House Committee on Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) released draft legislation to raise the tax on carried interest from the current 23.8 percent to 35 percent. In June 2015, Sander Levin (D-MI) introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2015 (H.R. 2889) to tax investment advisers with ordinary income tax rates. some in the private equity and hedge fund industries had been lobbying against changes, being among the biggest political donors on both sides of the aisle. In June 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that if Congress were to fail to act, as president she would ask the Treasury Department to use its regulatory authority to end a tax advantage. In 2018, under President Donald Trump's administration, a new tax plan increased the statutory amount of time assets must be held to qualify for the capital gains treatment from one year to three years, and limited the amount of interest deduction that could be taken to 30% of earnings before interest and taxes. The new rule had many exceptions, including excepting the entire real estate sector. Treasury guidance in August 2020 tightened certain of these exceptions. = United Kingdom = The Finance Act 1972 provided that gains on investments acquired by reason of rights or opportunities offered to individuals as directors or employees were, subject to various exceptions, taxed as income and not capital gains. This may strictly have applied to the carried interests of many venture-capital executives, even if they were partners and not employees of the investing fund, because they were often directors of the investee companies. In 1987, the Inland Revenue and the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) entered into an agreement which provided that in most circumstances gains on carried interest were not taxed as income. The Finance Act 2003 widened the circumstances in which investment gains were treated as employment-related and therefore taxed as income. In 2003 the Inland Revenue and the BVCA entered into a new agreement which had the effect that, notwithstanding the new legislation, most carried-interest gains continued to be taxed as capital gains and not as income.\\"Memorandum of Understanding, 2003, Inland Revenue and BVCA\\" (PDF). HM Revenue and Customs. Such capital gains were generally taxed at 10% as opposed to a 40% rate on income. In 2007, the favorable tax rates on carried interest attracted political controversy.. BBC News. July 3, 2007. It was said that cleaners paid taxes at a higher rate than the private-equity executives whose offices they cleaned.. BBC News. June 12, 2007. The outcome was that the capital-gains tax rules were reformed, increasing the rate on gains to 18%, but carried interest continued to be taxed as gains and not as income.\\"HMRC PBRN 17\\" (PDF).

The bet was to be settled on January 1, 2011. At the time the bet was made in 2005, the price of oil was $65. It soared to an all-time high of $145 per barrel in 2008 before plummeting below $50 per barrel in the same year in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The average price for a barrel of oil in 2010 was $80 ($71 in 2005 dollars), less than the $200 Simmons predicted. Simmons died on August 8, 2010, and the bet was paid out by his colleagues in Tierney's favor., The New York Times, By JOHN TIERNEY, Published: December 27, 2010 Background Simmons and Tierney had never met prior to the bet. Their association began after Simmons had been interviewed by a journalist colleague of Tierney's, Peter Maass, for a New York Times Magazine article called \\"The Breaking Point,\\" published on August 21, 2005. The article heavily emphasized the doomsday claims of Simmons's latest book Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy, which contains Simmons's prophecy of imminent global catastrophe which he asserted will be triggered by the allegedly soon-coming \\"peaking\\" of Saudi oil output, and the supposed domino effect of destruction that will subsequently be wreaked upon the global economy. Tierney's dubious reaction to the article prompted him to call Simmons, introduce himself, and ask Simmons to back up his claims with cash. The friendly wager was immediately worked out over the phone. Terms of the bet Of the many claims that Simmons made in the Times article, his prediction of a tripling in the price-per-barrel of crude oil struck Tierney as perhaps the most incredible. In the Peter Maass article, Simmons was quoted as saying: > \\"We're going to look back at history and say $55 a barrel was cheap,\\" > [Simmons] said, recalling a TV interview in which he predicted that a barrel > might hit triple digits. [Simmons] said that the anchor scoffed, in > disbelief, \\"A hundred dollars?\\" Simmons replied, \\"I wasn't talking about low > triple digits.\\" Tierney focused upon that one detail and the two men fashioned the bet accordingly. Their final agreement was a commitment to tabulate every closing price-per-barrel of oil for each market day of 2010, then average out those prices for the entire year from January 1 through December 31, adjusted for inflation to 2005 prices. If the year-end adjusted average comes out to $200.00 or more per barrel, Mr. Simmons wins. If it averages out to less than $200.00, Mr. Tierney wins. The winner takes the entire pot of US$10,000.00, plus interest‚Äî$5,000.00 from both parties, placed in escrow. The bet was made public just two days later in an op-ed piece by Tierney published in The New York Times on August 23, 2005 called \\"The $10,000.00 Question\\". Precedent and legacy of the Simon‚ÄìEhrlich wager This bet was admitted by both parties to be a good-natured resurrection of the same spirit and tradition behind the famous Simon‚ÄìEhrlich wager which spanned the years 1980‚Äì1990. Tierney was a lifelong friend and prot√©g√© of the late Julian Simon (the winner of the Simon‚ÄìEhrlich wager), and eagerly embraced the opportunity to follow in his mentor's footsteps. Tierney is (as was Simon) an avowed Cornucopian, believing in the ingenuity of humankind to adapt and improvise. Meanwhile, Simmons' Twilight in the Desert seemed to Tierney to be cut from the same doom-and- gloom cloth as Paul R. Ehrlich's The Population Bomb, a book published in 1968 which later became the impetus for the Simon‚ÄìEhrlich wager. When that well- renowned wager was settled in 1990, Simon's boomster victory over Ehrlich's doomster philosophies was heralded as a triumph for Cornucopian economics. Tierney made unabashed reference to that legendary wager as he gave his apologetic for embarking upon this redux of it: > I didn't try to argue with [Simmons] about Saudi Arabia, because I know next > to nothing about oil production there or anywhere else. I'm just following > the advice of a mentor and friend, the economist Julian Simon: if you find > anyone willing to bet that natural resource prices are going up, take him > for all you can. Inclusion of Rita Simon After the bet was agreed upon (but before it was made public) Tierney immediately called Rita Simon, the widow of Julian Simon. She delightedly joined with Tierney's effort to carry on with her late husband's legacy, and even financed one half of Tierney‚Äôs obligation to the bet by contributing US$2,500.00 of her own. Simmons's death Matthew Simmons died on August 8, 2010, thus preventing him from personally seeing the bet through to its resolution on January 1, 2011. Ongoing updates The price-per-barrel of crude oil was heavily scrutinized by oil industry watchers aware of this bet. Many peak oil websites made frequent reference to the Simmons‚ÄìTierney betUpdate on the Simmons‚ÄìTierney Bet, theoildrum.com, by Stuart Staniford on March 17, 2008 and some made daily tabulations and adjusted-for-inflation charts on the latest price-per-barrel. (The price-per- barrel of oil at the time of the bet‚ÄîAugust 2005‚Äîwas around $65.00. The price as of the initial publishing of this article‚ÄîMay 10, 2008‚Äîwas $125.96; the record high of $147 in July 2008 was attributed by some to a weak U.S. dollar.) With the dramatic drop in demand and prices for many commodities in the economic crisis of 2008, the average per-barrel price for December 2008 reached a post-spike low of $40.88. At the time, Simmons was asked by a reporter if he had any second thoughts about the wager and replied, \\"God, no. We bet on the average price in 2010. That‚Äôs an eternity from now.\\" The price of oil steadily climbed back to an average of $78.33 for the month of January 2010.Spot Prices for Crude Oil and Petroleum Products, WTI ‚Äì Cushing, Oklahoma. Retrieved 2010-02-26. As of December 2018, the inflation adjusted price of oil has still not surpassed the Jul 2008 peak.https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart Both Simmons and Tierney publicly availed their e-mail addresses with a formal and open invitation to anyone else in the general population who might like to make similar wagers.

Consisting of 0.36 oz of copper, it was designed by Benjamin Franklin and minted only in 1787. Its design is very similar to a 1776 Continental Currency dollar coin that was produced in pattern pieces as potential Continental currency but was never circulated. History Continental Currency 1/3-Dollar (obverse) with inscriptions \\"Fugio\\" and \\"Mind your business\\". On April 21, 1787, the Congress of the Confederation of the United States authorized a design for an official copper penny, later referred to as the Fugio cent because of its image of the Sun and its light shining down on a sundial with the caption, \\"Fugio\\" (Latin: I flee/fly, referring to time flying by). This coin was designed by Benjamin Franklin; as a reminder to its holders, he put at its bottom the message, \\"Mind your business\\". This design was based on the 1776 \\"Continental dollar\\" coin, which was produced in pattern pieces but was never circulated. Some historians believe that the word \\"business\\" was intended literally here, as Franklin was an influential and successful businessman. It does not mean \\"mind your own business\\" as that phrase is used today, but rather, \\"pay attention to your affairs\\". The reverse side of both the 1776 Continental dollar coins and paper notes, and the 1787 coins, bore the third motto \\"We Are One\\" (in English) surrounded by thirteen chain links, representing the original thirteen colonial states. Following the reform of the central government with the 1788 ratification of the 1787 Constitution, gold and silver coins transitioned to the motto \\"E pluribus unum\\" from the Great Seal of the United States. = The Bank of New York Hoard = In 1788, the Bank of New York stored several thousand Fugio cents in a keg in its basement. In 1856, the coins were put into cotton bags and stored away again. The trove was rediscovered in 1926. The coins were then given out as souvenirs and keepsakes to clients until 1948 when the American Numismatic Society examined the remaining 1,641 coins. The cache became known as the Bank of New York Hoard. Several of the coins were donated to the society while others were sold to collectors. All of the coins found were in mint state condition, most with brown toning and some with water damage. The bank retained 819 of the coins.

Japanese visual novel developed by Haikuo Soft, and was originally released in Japan as an erotic game on January 27, 2006, for Microsoft Windows. A PlayStation 2 version titled Yotsunoha: A Journey of Sincerity, published by Gadget Soft with adult content removed, was released in 2008, and an English version for Windows was released by Sol Press in 2018. The story in Yotsunoha focuses on the appeal of the four female main characters. The gameplay follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction. Yotsunoha has since then spawned two spin-off titles, Osananajimi to no Kurashi Kata and Nono to Kuraso, and has made several transitions to other media. A manga adaptation illustrated by Japanese artist Bow Ditama was first serialized in the Megami Magazine on January 30, 2008. It was followed by an original video animation series animated by Hal Film Maker. This was released on two single-episode DVDs on February 29, 2008, and March 28, 2008. There were also two Drama CDs, and two Internet radio shows hosted by Yui Sakakibara in order to promote the game. Gameplay An average conversation in Yotsunoha depicting the main character talking to Iori. Gameplay in Yotsunoha requires relatively little player interaction as most of the duration of the game is spent on only reading the text that appear on the screen, representing the dialogue between the numerous characters in the game. Similar to role-playing video games, the player is allowed to navigate through the school in a top-down perspective, and is allowed to enter different areas such as classrooms. At times, the player will come to a point, where he or she is given the chance to choose to navigate through the school with different female characters. During so, gameplay pauses until the player makes a choice. Depending on the choices the player makes, different events might occur as the player enter different areas, effectively progressing the plot in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience. To view all of the plot lines, the player will need to replay the game multiple times, picking different girls and access different areas to progress the plot in an alternate direction. One of the player's objective in the original version of the game is to view the hentai scenes depicting the main character Makoto having sexual intercourse with one of the heroines. Plot =Setting and themes= The main part of Yotsunoha's story takes place in an abandoned school named and its surrounding area. The school is a four-story building, housing facilities such as classrooms, the art room, the home economics room, and the light music club's room. There is also a small field outside of the school building, housing the small garden where the characters buried their time capsule prior to their separation. Childhood friendship plays an important role in the story. Throughout the story, characters are constantly reminded of their childhood memories by different locations in the school. This is further expressed by the characters' emotions before and after their separation, and the time capsule they have buried. =Principal characters= ; :Voiced by: Hideki Tasaka (OVA) :Makoto is the male protagonist of Yotsunoha. Despite being friendly, and always thinking for his friends before himself, he has trouble of expressing his feelings to others. Makoto choose Nono over everyone else before she left. ; :Voiced by: Yui Sakakibara :Nono is the main heroine of Yotsunoha. Despite being one year younger than Makoto, she is really helpful, taking tasks such as cooking and homemaking for Makoto and Iori, who lived next door to her prior to their separation. She moved to the Kansai region after the school's closure. ; :Voiced by: Junko Kusayanagi (game), Y≈´ko Got≈ç (OVA) :Iori is one of Makoto's childhood friends, and is the oldest of the group. Prior to their separation, she lived in Makoto's house, and despite being older than him, when at home would always refer him as her elder brother. She has an affection towards sweets and snacks, to such an extreme that she brought only tidbits despite her plans of staying at the school overnight. ; :Voiced by: Shizuku Ibuki (game), Mai Got≈ç (OVA, PS2 game) :Matsuri is another childhood friend of Makoto's. She has the highest academic scores among the group of friends, and stayed at a local school after their school's closedown. Matsuri is considerably more inarticulate and anti-social after the reunion, as a result of taking Makoto's comments before their separation too seriously. ; :Voiced by: Miru (game), Sayuri Yahagi (OVA, PS2 game) :Arisa is a weak and quiet girl who has transferred into Makoto's class shortly before its closure. =Story= The story of Yotsunoha revolves around a group of friends, reunited after being separated for three years as a result of the closure of Mochizuki Academy, the school they have attended in together. Upon arrival, Makoto Y≈´ki, the protagonist discovers that the time capsule the group of friends buried prior to their separation has been dug up. In its place is a note left by his former teacher Yamamoto, informing him that he has dug up their capsule and hidden it elsewhere in the school. After being reunited, Makoto and his group of friends decide to stay overnight, looking for clues left behind by their teacher, and find the time capsule. Development Yotsunoha is the second commercial project of the then d≈çjin soft developer Haikuo Soft, following their previous work on Sukumizu Police. Tatomu and Keikei, two writers who have previously worked on _Summer, planned the scenario used in Yotsunoha, while work on the computer graphics, in addition to character designs, were split between four members, Hƒ´de, Xsara, Koshino and Akira Kasukabe. The music used in the game was composed solely by Ry≈ç Ky≈çna. Several improvements have been made to the PS2 version of the game. Gadget Soft hired Suno, a scenario planner to provide additional scenario after the adult content in the game is removed. Hal Film Maker, the studio that has previously adapted Yotsunoha into OVA, was also hired for the computer graphics used in the game. =Release history= Yotsunoha was first available to the public as a free game demo, released online on September 24, 2005, which gives the player a glimpse into the story and gameplay of Yotsunoha. The game was later released as a limited edition containing a set of three CD-ROMs for Microsoft Windows on January 10, 2006. It was later followed by a regular edition, released on September 1, 2006, as one DVD. This version of the game contained new computer graphic scenes and additional voice acting for side characters, which was later available to the limited edition through a patch. A PlayStation 2 version titled Yotsunoha: A Journey of Sincerity with adult content removed published by Gadget Soft was originally released on August 28, 2008, as both a limited edition and a regular edition, after it was delayed from its original July 24, 2008, release date.

It was later followed by a second Drama CD release, released on April 23, 2008, featuring the voice cast of the OVA adaptation. =Manga= Yotsunoha was also adapted into a manga series, illustrated by Japanese artist Bow Ditama, known for his previous work on Mahoromatic.

The second volume was then released on March 28, 2008. Both volumes contain the episode itself and a book containing illustrations by Hƒ´de. Music Yotsunoha's soundtrack was composed solely by Ry≈ç Ky≈çna, who has previously also worked on Suku Mizu Porisu, the first commercial project of Haikuo Soft. Aside from the in-game soundtrack, he has also composed the two theme songs used in the game, \\"Yotsunoha\\", the opening theme sung by Chata, and \\"Shining Orange\\", the ending theme sung by Yui Sakakibara. The lyrics of both of the songs were written by Keikei, one of the scenario planners. An original soundtrack disc, containing the music used in the game and the opening and ending themes, were included as an extra in the limited edition release of the game. The OVA adaptation of Yotsunoha featured a new set of soundtrack, written by artists from I've Sound.

It focuses on the use of computation to solve problems that students are most passionate about. It presents computer science as a cutting-edge technological discipline that empowers them to solve problems of personal interest (socially relevant with a \\"little s\\"), as well as problems that are important to society at large (socially relevant with a \\"capital s\\"). SRC emphasizes the use of computation for solving problems of personal and societal interest to students. It offers opportunities to demonstrate that computer science is a mainstream endeavor and that it offers conceptual and technological tools for solving meaningful, real-world problems. Courses in this new framework help students identify and model tasks, and design and implement computational solutions that show deep understanding of their embedding in the real world. At the very least, SRC offers interesting examples to illustrate foundational concepts in computer science. By emphasizing problem-solving, and by giving students practice in recognizing needs and engineering solutions to them via computation, SRC at its finest promises to create a more entrepreneurial, as well as a more broadly educated computer scientist.

SR 290 travels parallel to a Union Pacific railroad from (I-90) in Spokane through Millwood and across the Spokane River thrice towards Spokane Valley, where the highway intersects . From Spokane Valley, the roadway continues to the Idaho state border, where it becomes . The current route of SR 290 was formerly county roads between 1901 and 1937 when it became Secondary State Highway 2H (SSH 2H). The highway ran from (US 2) and in Downtown Spokane to Idaho until a 1964 renumbering of state highways, which re-designated SSH 2H as SR 290\\\\. A short spur route connecting the main highway to I-90 was also added during the renumbering, but SR 290 was realigned to replace the route in 2005. Route description SR 290 begins as a short freeway at a directional T-interchange with (I-90) east of downtown Spokane. This interchange was originally built for a planned North Spokane Corridor in the 1970s. The freeway continues north to an interchange with 2nd Avenue that only allows eastbound traffic to enter and westbound traffic to exit the freeway. The highway is named Hamilton Street and travels north over Sprague Avenue, BNSF Railway tracks, and the Spokane River before intersecting Trent Avenue, the former route of the roadway prior to 2005. At the intersection, located near Gonzaga University, SR 290 turns east and becomes Trent Avenue before crossing the Spokane River again. Trent Avenue travels northeast through an industrial district, paralleling the Spokane International branch of the Union Pacific Railroad, through Millwood before intersecting , locally named Pines Road. The highway crosses the Spokane River a third time and enters the Trentwood neighborhood of Spokane Valley, where it intersects Sullivan Road by way of a diamond interchange. From Spokane Valley, the roadway travels northeast through farmland to Newman Lake, where it crosses into Idaho and becomes , which continues east to Rathdrum as Trent Road. SR 290 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 7,000 vehicles at Havana Street in eastern Spokane to a maximum of 35,000 vehicles at the intersection of Hamilton Street and Trent Avenue. One of the main uses for SR 290 is to connect Interstate 90 to Spokane's University District, which includes the campuses of Gonzaga University, Washington State University, and Eastern Washington University. History SR 290 was SSH 2H prior to 1964. A road following the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway line from Spokane to the Idaho state border at Newman Lake has existed since 1901. In 1937, the road became Secondary State Highway 2H (SSH 2H) and ran from in Spokane to Wellesley Avenue at the Idaho state border. SSH 2H was scheduled to be designated SR 290 in 1970 after a highway renumbering in 1964. The new designation was made to align with the sign route, now state route, system. In 1967, the eastern terminus of SSH 2H was shifted north to align with (ID 53). In 1970, the state route system came into effect and SR 290 was established along with a spur route connecting the main highway to (I-90). In 2005, the western terminus of SR 290 was moved southeast to an exit with I-90, replacing the spur route. The highway crosses the Spokane River on the East Trent Bridge, which was constructed in 1910 by the Spokane city government. The concrete arch bridge is planned to be closed on June 1, 2020, and will be replaced by a new structure that is set to open in 2023. Major intersections Spur route Washington State Route 290 Spur was a long spur route of SR 290 prior to 2005. The spur route served as a short connector to (I-90) east of downtown Spokane and ran from SR 290 at the intersection of Trent Avenue and Hamilton Street near Gonzaga University to a directional T-interchange with I-90, via a bridge over the Spokane River. The highway was originally established along with SR 290, which went east from (US 2) and (US 395) in downtown Spokane to Idaho. This spur route was proposed to be the southern terminus of the North/South Freeway that would bypass Downtown Spokane and a freeway segment was built, but never finished due to priority going to the Interstate Highways. The western terminus of SR 290 was realigned in 2005, ending at I-90 along the former route of SR 290 Spur. ;Major intersections References External links *Highways of Washington State *WSDOT ‚Äì S.

Hepatotoxicity Determining hepatotoxicity (toxic effects of a substance on the liver) remains a major challenge in clinical practice due to lack of reliable markers. Many other conditions lead to similar clinical as well as pathological picture. To diagnose hepatotoxicity, a causal relationship between the use of the toxin or drug and subsequent liver damage has to be established, but might be difficult, especially when idiosyncratic reaction is suspected. Simultaneous use of multiple drugs may add to the complexity. As in acetaminophen toxicity, well established dose dependent pharmacological hepatotoxicity is easier to spot. Interpretation The CIOMS/RUCAM scale has been proposed to establish causal relationship between offending drug and liver damage. The CIOMS/RUCAM scale involves a scoring system which categorizes the suspicion into \\"definite or highly probable\\" (score > 8), \\"probable\\" (score 6-8), \\"possible\\" (score 3-5), \\"unlikely\\" (score 1-2) and \\"excluded\\" (score ‚â§ 0). In clinical practice physicians put more emphasis on the presence or absence of similarity between the biochemical profile of the patient and known biochemical profile of the suspected toxicity ( e.g. cholestatic damage in amoxycillin-clauvonic acid ).

In other words, memory cannot be localized to a single cortical area, but is instead distributed throughout the cortex. This theory is contrasted by functional specialization. This is one of two principles that Karl Lashley published in 1950, alongside the equipotentiality principle. Early theories In the 19th century, animal researchers and scientists were divided into two main groups in terms of how they believe the brain compensated for induced brain damage. The redundancy theorists hypothesized that any lesioned section of cerebral mass had an almost duplicate section, usually on the opposing hemisphere. This \\"back-up\\" area was considered to be what takes over the functions of the lesioned area. On the other hand, vicariation theorists believed that different areas of the brain with different functions could assume responsibility for the affected area. Both ideas were highly debated and led to increased research on neuroplasticity and lesion research, eventually affecting the lesion research of Flourens and Lashley. Contributors Localization theories can be dated as far back as Aristotle, but the man credited with the beginning concepts of field theory was Jean Pierre Flourens. Field theory is the concept that the brain acts as a single functional unit. He devised the first principle of mass action, stating, > \\"As long as not too much of the lobes is removed, they may in due time > regain the exercise of their functions. Passing certain limits, however, the > animal regains them only imperfectly, and passing these new limits it does > not regain them at all. Finally, if one sensation comes back, all come back. > If one faculty reappears, they all reappear.... This shows that each of > these organs is only a single organ.\\" He also developed the theory of equipotentiality, stating, \\"All sensations, all perceptions, and all volition occupy concurrently the same seat in these organs. The faculty of sensation, perception, and volition is then essentially one faculty.\\" Karl Lashley's most famous research was an attempt to find the parts of the brain that were responsible for learning and memory traces, a hypothetical structure he called the engram. He trained rats to perform specific tasks (seeking a food reward), then lesioned varying portions of the rats' cortexes, either before or after the animals received the training depending upon the experiment. The amount of cortical tissue removed had specific effects on acquisition and retention of knowledge, but the location of the removed cortex had no effect on the rats' performance in the maze. This led Lashley to conclude that memories are not localized but widely distributed across the cortex. Mass action principle versus functional specialization There is evidence supporting both the mass action principle and functional specialization within the brain. Functional specialization is the idea that functions are localized within the brain and can only be carried out by particular area(s) of the brain. Some tasks appear to work on the mass action principle, with lesions causing less drastic effects than would be expected if the tasks were localized within the brain. This was shown in Lashley's rat maze experiments, in which the amount of tissue removed was more important to the rat's performance than where the tissue was removed from within the brain. There are, however, examples of highly specialized areas of the brain in which even small amounts of damage can cause dramatic effects on people's abilities to perform certain tasks. Two such areas effect the comprehension of speech and the ability to produce coherent speech, Wernicke's area and Broca's area, respectively. Criticisms It is now believed that Flourens may have removed more than just the parts of the hemispheres that he claimed because his experiments can be replicated without his same drastic results. At the time, extraction methods were very crude and little was understood about the stages of recovery. These things contributed to the increased likelihood of symptoms occurring right after extraction to be attributed directly to the site of the lesion. Flourens' doctrine was widely accepted even though there were anatomists and physiologists disproving his ideas: * Thomas Willis showed that there are nerves that connect the heart, lungs, and stomach to the cerebellum. * Fran√ßois Pourfour du Petit demonstrated that localization of motor movements on one side of the body was contained in the hemisphere on the opposite side. In the 1860s, Hughlings Jackson also came to these conclusions after connecting convulsions on one side of the body to the disease of the opposite side of the brain * Alexander Bain explained the nervous system as a sort of interconnected system with the brain that transmits impulses * New experiments on electrical excitability in 1870 from Gustav Theodor Fritsch, Eduard Hitzig, and David Ferrier contributed to new findings regarding localization of function. And although their methods were still producing results that are considered off the mark today, they were important in building a foundation of support for a localization theory * Then Lashley came along with his publication of Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence in 1929. His findings were under the umbrella of field theory, but he didn't completely agree with Flourens. He determined that only the more elementary functions are localized, with the more complex ones not being bound to certain structures. Shepherd Ivory Franz contributed to this field greatly by using better methods to study live animals. Lashley used these methods in combination with a large sample of animals to get results that can be statistically analyzed, and therefore came up with his equipotentiality and mass action theories. However, many others came up with different conclusions based on his results that again cast doubt upon Lashley's determinations of what was observed. Conclusion Currently mass action principle is accepted as a mechanism for some functions within the brain. However, there have been some functions that are believed to be contained within specific areas of the brain (many related to speech, which was impossible to determine when the mass action principle was theorized, as experiments historically only used animals). It does not appear that this difference is determined by difficulty of the function, as some highly specialized tasks are localized.  References  Further reading Lashley, K. S. (1929).

Woolley was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and raised in a Quaker family. He joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in the 1830s and later served as a missionary in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. In 1851, Woolley was a member of the Utah Territorial Legislature. For many years Woolley was bishop of the 13th Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City. He referred to a member of his ward, the young Heber J. Grant, as lazy, which has been likened to someone calling Abraham Lincoln dishonest.Madsen, Truman G., Defender of the Faith: The B. H. Roberts Story, (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980) p. 67 Woolley was the grandfather of J. Reuben Clark and Spencer W. Kimball, among other Latter-day Saint leaders. He was also the father of John Wickersham Woolley and grandfather of Lorin Calvin Woolley, founding leaders of the Mormon Fundamentalist movement. Early life Edwin Dilworth Woolley was born and raised in West Chester, Pennsylvania. His family were initially members of the Society of Friends (Quakers). His mother died in 1826 and in 1831 Woolley married Mary Wickersham. When Woolley's father died in 1832, he and his wife moved with Woolley's six siblings to East Rochester, Ohio, to the Wickersham home. He operated a general store and when coal was discovered on his property he set up a mining operation as well. He became acquainted with Mormon missionaries but his wife was actually the first to convert. After meeting Joseph Smith's family, Woolley decided to convert as well, in 1837.Arrington, Leonard J.;Bitton, Davis Saints without Halos (Signature Books, 1981 Retrieved 10-26-11) Chapter Six His family followed suit soon afterwards, as well as members of Mary's family. Woolley, being a man of influence and wealth, was appointed to serve as the leader of the East Rochester branch of the church. Woolley continued to prosper and soon was financing Mormon operations and loaning money to the founder of the church, Joseph Smith. He also served an LDS proselytizing mission to West Chester, Pennsylvania.Arrington, Leonard J.

He also served several terms as a representative in the Utah Territorial Legislature and as Salt Lake County Recorder.

Ferguson), which upheld the constitutionality of state laws requiring racial segregation.  History  The Reconstruction period and its subsequent end led to a discussion among both Blacks and Whites in the South how to interpret \\"equal rights\\" and the new Reconstruction Amendments. J. P. Weaver, a Black preacher, had advised Blacks to accept separate accommodations if they are \\"first-class\\".Hasian Jr., pp. 3‚Äì5 \\"But if there is no such accommodation set apart for you, and you are crowded upon by base and reckless beings, depriving you of all that tends to your happiness ... excuse yourself for being colored, and walk in another car and cabin\\".Hasian Jr., p. 5 Following Reconstruction and the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, the Democratic Party came back to power. There began a process of \\"renegotiating the definitions of 'equal rights' in debates over post-Civil War amendments\\". Legislators proposed the Separate Car Bill which segregated Blacks from Whites in separate but equal conditions on train cars. Violations of the law were a misdemeanor crime punishable by a fine of at most $25 or twenty days jail time. The law did not go uncontested through the legislature. Republican legislator Henry Demas from St John the Baptist Parish challenged the bill as coming from the \\"ranks of Democratic Senators who pandered to the needs of the lower classes\\".Hasian Jr., p. 9 To him, the bill was not a product of upper class white citizens but those with no \\"social or moral standing in the community\\". Despite some opposition, the Separate Car Act passed the Louisiana State Senate by 23 to 6.  Reception  Paul Trevigne, a Louisianan African American, said the law was not practical. He felt that this \\"force class legislation\\" would fail in the near term because it did not take into account the lives of people living in a cosmopolitan Louisiana. \\"[F]uture generations would be ashamed\\", he said, to see such laws on the books.Hasian Jr., p. 10 Although most Blacks opposed the law, it had strong support from Whites. An editorial in The Daily Picayune of New Orleans spoke of \\"almost unanimous demand on the party of White people of the State for the enactment of the law\\" which would \\"increase the comfort for the traveling public\\".Hasian Jr., p. 11 The editorial also argued that it would put Louisiana in line with other Southern states.  Testing the law  In 1891, under Louis Martinet, a group of activists from New Orleans set up the Citizens Committee to Test the Constitutionality of the Separate Car Law in order to challenge the constitutionality of the law.Packard, p. 74 The first case the committee decided to test was Daniel Desdunes, son of Citizens Committee co-founder Rodolphe Desdunes, in 1892. On February 24, Desdunes bought a first-class ticket, boarded a designated White car on the Louisiana and Nashville Railroad from New Orleans to Montgomery, Alabama. The destination of another state was chosen specifically because of the belief that it violated the Commerce Clause. Desdune's case never went to trial because the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled on May 25 in the unrelated Abbott v. Hicks that the Separate Car Act did not apply to interstate passengers, rendering the test moot. For their second attempt the group found Homer Plessy, a mostly white \\"octoroon\\", who was still considered a \\"negro\\" under Louisiana law.Packard, pp. 73-4 On June 7, 1892 Plessy purchased a first-class ticket to take him from New Orleans to Covington on the East Louisiana Railroad, this time both destinations being within the state. Plessy boarded the \\"white carriage\\" where the conductor had been informed ahead of time that the light-skinned Plessy was legally Black. The conductor was told by Plessy that he was colored and the conductor had him arrested and charged with violation of the law. The case was brought before John Howard Ferguson‚Äîthe same judge who had argued the law could not apply to interstate travel in Abbott v. Hicks. Plessy's lawyers argued on the basis 13th and 14th Amendments that their client's rights had been violated. Ferguson ruled that Louisiana was free to regulate such actions and that Plessy was guilty as charged. The Louisiana Supreme Court upheld this decision. Finally, the case ended in the Supreme Court of the United States in Plessy v. Ferguson with the judgment being upheld, leading to the judicial sanction of \\"separate but equal\\".

Route description Beginning at an intersection with SR 231, named Main Street, in Springdale, the highway travels east, quickly exiting the city and traversing rural woodlands, paralleling a BNSF Railway line. The highway descends, crossing over the railroad line and entering the community on the northern shores of Loon Lake before terminating at US 395. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WSDOT calculated that as few as 1,800 cars traveled on the highway near the western terminus, and as many as 4,800 cars used the highway at its eastern terminus at US 395.

Accessed May 10, 2008 In the early 1930s, he began working on another syndicated feature, Tillie the Toiler, for King, as well as writing gag cartoons, articles and features for the Newark Star-Eagle/Ledger newspaper (1931‚Äì1934), also finding time to work on a number of pulp magazine stories throughout the 1930s. =National Allied Publications (DC)= In late 1934, he became associated with Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson's fledgling company National Allied Publications, later known as DC Comics. Initially an assistant editor, before becoming associate editor (1936‚Äì38), Ellsworth worked on such titles as Billy the Kid, Little Linda and More Fun Comics, as well as producing cover roughs for several years. Ellsworth left the company in c. 1937-38 for a brief hiatus in California before returning to DC a couple of years later. He subsequently served as editorial director until c. 1951‚Äì1953, in particular on such titles as the flagship titles Action Comics, Adventure Comics, Batman, Detective Comics and Superman between 1940 and 1951, and later on such diverse titles as The Adventures of Alan Ladd, All-Star Comics, Green Lantern, Mr. District Attorney, Real Fact Comics, Real Screen Comics, Scribbly, Superboy and Wonder Woman (among others) between 1948 and 1951. In 1945, he licensed The Fox and the Crow and other animated characters from their distributor, Columbia Pictures. =Pulps= Ellsworth also wrote short stories for the pulp titles Black Bat, G-Man (including the Dan Fowler novel \\"Spotlight on Murder\\" in September 1942Pulp Superhero #D.

Accessed May 10, 2008 Comics, including Batman Acting as DC's major creative guide and editor during the company's early years, Ellsworth oversaw editorially both scripts and art for several diverse comics (including Batman, World's Best Comics, World's Finest Comics, et al.), developed a number of projects (including creating Congo Bill in 1941) and wrote several more, including Hollywood Screen Shots (1936) (which, like some others, he also pencilled and inked), Slam Bradley, Genius Jones, Laughing at Life, Speed Saunders and Starman, among many other characters and comics. He also sketched \\"rough cover layouts for DC's top titles,\\" including notably some for \\"Batman and Detective Comics until about 1946.\\" =Newspaper strip= Ellsworth was also the first writer on the Batman & Robin newspaper strip, which appeared first on Sundays and later on weekdays. Featuring artwork primarily from Sheldon Moldoff and Joe Giella, Ellsworth wrote the strip between 1966 and 1970, whereupon E. Nelson Bridwell took over for a couple of years. TV and film In addition to his extensive comics work, Ellsworth \\"was DC's movie studio contact\\" on a number of projects, keeping his \\"editorial director\\" title, but working mainly on \\"DC properties in Hollywood\\" between c. 1951‚Äì1959. =The Superman serials= Ellsworth was the representative from National Comics during the production of the 1948 serial Superman, a position which gave him absolute control of the script and production. He initially objected to casting of Kirk Alyn as the lead, whom producer Sam Katzman had found by looking through studio photographs. This was made even worse when Alyn came in for a screen test, during filming on a historical film, with a goatee and moustache. These initial reservations were eventually overcome and Alyn got the part. Columbia's advertising claimed that they could not get an actor to fill the role so they had hired Superman himself. Kirk Alyn was merely playing Clark Kent. =The Adventures of Superman= Most notably, Ellsworth was a consultant on the serial sequel Atom Man Vs. Superman (1950) (also with Kirk Alyn), and co-wrote the feature film Superman and the Mole Men (1951) before becoming a producer, episode writer, and script editor on the subsequent live- action TV series The Adventures of Superman (both starring George Reeves as the Man of Steel). In 1958, he created a pilot titled Superpup, which attempted to capitalise on that series' success by recasting the Superman mythos in a fictional universe populated by dogs instead of people. Three years later, Ellsworth helped produce another, ultimately aborted pilot for another spin-off series called The Adventures of Superboy. =Other= According to noted comics historian Jerry Bails, Ellsworth was also a consultant on the two Batman serials in 1943 and 1949; the Superman serial starring Kirk Alyn that was a precursor to the later live-action Superman features, and the Congo Bill serial (1949). He is listed as having been ‚Äì for \\"one week only\\" ‚Äì a consultant on the 1966 Batman TV series (with Adam West), and a writer for the Superman radio show during the war years. In addition, he wrote the Off-Broadway production Maiden Voyage (1935), for the TV series The Millionaire1 (1955) between c. 1954‚Äì56 and produced another pilot in 1961, this time for a \\"comedy-detective series starring Sheree North\\" to be called Here's O'Hare (ABC did not pursue the show).Whitney Ellsworth at the IMDb. Accessed May 10, 2008 Ellsworth is also said by Bails to have helped co-write The Godfather. Later life Ellsworth left DC (shortly after leaving the Batman newspaper strip) in 1970/1971. He died on September 7, 1980, in North Hollywood. In 1985, he was posthumously named as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great. =References in popular culture= *The actor/film historian Jim Beaver, preparing a biography of Adventures of Superman star George Reeves, played a character called \\"Ellsworth\\" in the TV series Deadwood (2004).

Biography John McGuire initially studied composition with Robert Arthur Gross at Occidental College, where he earned a BA in 1964 (; ; ). He received a succession of three Alfred E. Hertz Traveling Scholarships from the University of California at Berkeley (1965‚Äì66, 1966‚Äì67, 1967‚Äì68), and a Fulbright Traveling Scholarship (1966‚Äì67), which together enabled him to study with Krzysztof Penderecki at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen from 1966‚Äì68, and at the Fourth Cologne Courses for New Music, under Karlheinz Stockhausen, in 1967 (; . Two scholarships from the State of North Rhine‚ÄìWestphalia for studies in Germany made it possible for him to participate in the composition studios given by Stockhausen at Darmstadt in 1967 and again in 1968. Returning to the United States, he continued his studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where his composition teachers included Ingolf Dahl and Seymour Shifrin. After completing his MA there in 1970, he once again moved to Europe, at first studying computer composition with Gottfried Michael Koenig at the Institute of Sonology of the University of Utrecht from 1970 to 1971. Having found the atmosphere in Germany congenial, following his studies in Utrecht he settled in Germany again in 1972 and remained for the next twenty-five years, at first working as a pianist with the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Saarbr√ºcken from 1972‚Äì75. From 1975 to 1977 he studied electronic music with Hans Ulrich Humpert at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln, later working as an organist at the Kirche St. Nikolaus von Tolentino in R√∂srath from 1979‚Äì82. He received six commissions from WDR in Cologne for pieces he realised in the electronic-music studio there, among them Pulse Music III in 1978, Vanishing Points in 1988, and A Cappella in 1997 (; ). He has also had works commissioned by Radio Bremen, from pianist Herbert Henck (48 Variations, for 2 pianos), from Dartmouth College, and from the Ministry of Culture of North Rhine‚ÄìWestphalia. In 1995 he was composer-in-residence at the Akademie Schloss Wiepersdorf in Brandenburg. In 1998 he returned to his native country, working for a time as an editor for the Carl Fischer music-publishing firm in New York City starting in 1998. From 2000 to 2002 he taught advanced composition and twentieth- century music as a part-time Visiting Adjunct Professor at Columbia University. He is married to the soprano Beth Griffith, for whom he composed A Cappella in 1990‚Äì97 and Contradance in 2000‚Äì2004. Musical style and influences Kyle describes McGuire as a \\"postminimalist\\". His music seeks a synthesis of minimalism and the serialism with which he had become acquainted during his studies in Germany, especially with Stockhausen. \\"His work over the next 25 years was devoted entirely to the exploration and development of various aspects of this synthesis, in particular the fusion of elemental tonal functions with chromatic time structures\\" .

Of his Christian contemporaries, Lang was influenced by the writings of G.H. Pember, C.H. Spurgeon, Arthur Tappan Pierson, and George M√ºller. Today, some admirers of G.H. Lang remember him as one of the few Bible expositors who, in the past 150 years, saw the 'ground of the church'. He argued that the ground of the church is essentially related to the practical oneness of all the believers in Christ.G. H. Lang, The Churches of God - Their Constitution, Government, Discipline and Ministry, London: The Paternoster Press, 1959. Life and Belief Lang was born in Greenwich, England. His mother died shortly after Lang's birth, and he was raised under the influence of his Christian father. Lang made a profession of the Christian faith and dedicated his life to Jesus Christ at 7 years old. His family belonged to the Exclusive Brethren; but later in life, he affiliated himself with the Open Brethren. Lang held the belief that the only qualification for a believer was having made a sincere profession of faith. For this one belief, Lang is considered by some Plymouth Brethren as the most controversial figure since Darby regarding the administration of the Church affairs.Douglas W. Brealey, \\"The Witness,\\" December 1958 Later in Lang's life and teachings, he challenged Darby's \\"federation view\\" of the church and stressed the local fellowship's autonomy and independence. Ministry and Work Lang upheld a principle that he \\"did not look to man for the means of his subsistence, but only to God\\", and Lang's faith grew with its exercise. In Lang's words,G.H. Lang, Praying is Working, 1988, 4th ed. > \\"Praying is working, and not merely an adjunct to working. It is a form of > working, and not simply a somewhat properly added to our efforts out of > reverence to the Almighty; nor is it only an appeal for His blessing to > prosper our labours. When a righteous man prays he works. For prayer in the > spirit is one agency by which the Spirit of God effects through the believer > His will, and is, indeed, a putting forth of His energy.\\" Lang was a very close student of the Holy Scriptures and an independent thinker. He was not prepared to take traditional interpretations unless he was personally convinced that they were right. Lang was also an active Gospel preacher and from time to time he was found in countries from the Arabian deserts to the Russian steppes preaching. Lang almost traveled and preached in the entire world in his missionary career. Lang once said,Schoettle Publishing Company, A Short Biography of George Henry Lang > \\"No man should write a book until he is 40. He needs to prove his theories > in practice before publishing.\\" Most of Lang's books were published after he was 50 years old. Death Lang died at age 83, in Wimborne, Dorset, England. Books Lang's writings include fourteen major books and many other booklets. Some of his works are noted below. *Anthony Norris Groves - Biography of A.N.

Early life and education  King was born in 1940 in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. His father died when King was only ten, leaving his mother, Gladys, a widow at thirty-one. Gladys raised King and his two siblings while working in a kitchen at The Greenbrier resort, all the while instilling in them the importance of hard work and education. King and his sister would later endow a scholarship at West Virginia University in honor of their mother‚Äôs dedication to her children and their education. After receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from West Virginia University in 1961, King entered active duty in the United States Air Force and served as an officer in the Office of Special Investigations. After his discharge in 1964, he returned to Greenbrier County to work as a teacher. While teaching, he met his future wife, a fellow teacher named Julia Kay Doak, and the two wed in April 1965. The following year, King enrolled at West Virginia University College of Law, where he was a member of the West Virginia Law Review and president of the Student Bar Association. He graduated Order of the Coif in 1968.  Professional career  King began his legal career as a law clerk in Charleston for Judge John A. Field, Jr. on the Southern District of West Virginia. After clerking, King joined the firm Haynes & Ford in Lewisburg. He returned to Charleston in 1970 to serve as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of West Virginia, where he stayed until 1974. One of King‚Äôs most significant prosecutions during this time involved the bribing of a juror in the 1968 trial of former West Virginia Governor William Wallace Barron and some of his associates, who faced corruption charges. The jury foreperson confessed to accepting a bribe for acquittals, and Governor Barron subsequently pled guilty, received a twelve- year prison sentence, and became a government witness in the trials of two other people implicated in the bribery. As an Assistant U.S. Attorney, King also prosecuted five Logan County officials on civil rights charges relating to electoral fraud. In 1974, King returned to private practice at Spilman, Thomas, Battle & Klostermeyer in Charleston and became a partner in 1975. While at the Spilman firm, King served on the West Virginia State Bar‚Äôs Committee on Legal Ethics. He investigated alleged ethical violations by lawyers and represented the committee in proceedings before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. In 1977, at the recommendation of West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, President Carter appointed King U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia. As U.S. Attorney, King took on high- profile white-collar crime and public corruption cases. His investigation into the liquor industry and Alcohol Beverage Control Commission of West Virginia resulted in the conviction of more than forty individuals and corporations on charges including commercial bribery, mail fraud, extortion, and RICO violations. In 1981, King returned to private practice and helped found the law firm King Betts & Allen (now Allen Guthrie McHugh & Thomas). He was a managing partner from 1981 to 1993 and from 1997 until his judicial appointment in 1998. During his thirty years of practice, King tried over 120 cases and argued many appeals. As a federal prosecutor, he prosecuted defendants in cases involving public corruption, electoral fraud, organized crime, and many other crimes. In private practice, he also handled many criminal cases as well as civil cases ranging from wrongful death, personal injury, products liability, professional malpractice, and civil rights. Reflecting on King‚Äôs record, Judge M. Blane Michael of the Fourth Circuit remarked that ‚Äúthere was little that Judge King had not done in the practice of law by the time he became a judge.\\"  Federal judicial service  President Bill Clinton nominated King to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on June 24, 1998, after Judge K. K. Hall took senior status. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the utmost compliment to be recommended and supported by Senator Byrd and Senator Rockefeller,‚Äù said King to the Charleston Gazette, ‚Äú[a]nd the expression of support by President Clinton is the greatest honor of my life.‚Äù At the Senate Judiciary Committee‚Äôs hearing on September 9, 1998, Senator Byrd praised King‚Äôs ‚Äúdeep-seated integrity, strong work ethic, and love of public service.‚Äù He also compared King to Alexander the Great, who, when presented with an indictment, would ‚Äúput one hand over one ear and keep that ear closed‚Äù to ensure both sides would have an equal opportunity to present their case. ‚ÄúI believe that Bob King will be the same [kind of judge],‚Äù said Byrd. The United States Senate unanimously confirmed King to the Fourth Circuit on October 8, 1998, and he received his commission the next day.

History =Bridge (1925‚Äì1939)= The Julia Butler Hansen Bridge southbound from Cathlamet towards Puget Island. In June 1925, Walter Coates began a ferry service across the Cathlamet Channel, from Puget Island to Cathlamet. The original ferry was later replaced by the Cathlamet, which could load cars. In 1932, Coates sold the ferry service, fearing that the newly completed Ocean Beach Highway, soon to be SR 4, would press drivers to the competing Astoria‚ÄìMegler Ferry. In 1939, the year the Julia Butler Hansen Bridge opened, ferry service ceased on the Puget Island - Cathlamet run. The Julia Butler Hansen Bridge, which currently carries the route of SR 409, which will be designated in 1964, from Puget Island to Cathlamet, opened in August 1939. The bridge, initially named the Puget Island - Cathlamet Bridge, was later renamed to honor Julia Butler Hansen, who served in the Washington House of Representatives from 1939 until 1960, and U.S. representative for the third congressional district from 1960 until 1974. Lacey V. Murrow, R. W. Finke and Clark H. Eldridge designed the bridge, which spanned and consisted of four steel spans when first constructed. Steel comprises the majority of the truss bridge's structure. President Franklin D. Roosevelt commenced the five-day celebration of the bridge's opening with a ribbon cutting, remotely controlled from the White House via telegraph. =Designation (1943‚Äìpresent)= SSH 12F (1943‚Äì1964) After a reconstruction of the Primary and Secondary Highways in 1943, the road that later became SR 409 was established as Secondary State Highway 12F (SSH 12F).

He was born at Benfeld, Alsace in 1872. He was ordained as a priest in the order of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart in 1896, after study in Rome. He began active missionary work in Papua in 1900, then in 1906 re- established the Catholic Church in Palmerston (now Darwin), Northern Territory. He established an Aboriginal mission on Bathurst Island in 1910 and worked there until 1938. Though unsuccessful in converting adults, he persisted with children's education and \\"bought\\" many girls promised in marriage to older men according to tribal custom. He became known as the \\"Bishop with 150 wives\\" (also the title of his autobiography) for his activities in freeing girls from such arranged marriages, thus making it possible for them to marry men of their own age. Gsell was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1935,GSELL, Francis Xavier, It's an Honour (Australian Government), 3 June 1935. and was Bishop of Darwin from 1938 to 1949, during which time he was influential in founding Aboriginal missions at Port Keats and Arltunga.

As Bishop of Darwin he was in charge of the Catholic Church's share of the policy of child removals of children of mixed parentage now known as the Stolen Generations. He defended the practice, writing \\"if they had families, and if they were surrounded by that love and affection family life offers to the young even amongst primitive peoples, it might be cruel.

Biography Martin Segitz was born in F√ºrth in 1853, in what was then the independent Kingdom of Bavaria. After originally working in the tin industry, in 1890 he became an editor for the Fr√§nkische Tagespost newspaper in Nuremberg. He engaged himself in the workers movement and became a member of the SPD. From 1897 to 1927, he was a member of the Bavarian parliament, the Landtag. He also served as a member of the German Reichstag from 1898 to 1903 and again from 1912 to 1918. He was also a member of the council of the city of F√ºrth for 25 years. He formed a workers library in Nuremberg, which was then the biggest in Germany. Segitz also had a large part in the formation of the first metal worker union in Germany.City of F√ºrth website - Gedenken an Martin Segitz (in German), 24 August 2006, accessed: 10 May 2008 After World War I, he became a state commissioner for the demobilizing of the home coming troops of the Bavarian army. After the assassination of Kurt Eisner, Segitz became for a short time, from 1 March to 17 March 1919, the acting prime minister of Bavaria. Due to the political turmoil at this stage, his government, and initially the following one under Johannes Hoffmann too, had little control and was not universally recognized in Bavaria. After these events, he served as the Minister of the Interior and Minister of Commerce, Industry and Trade under the Hoffmann government in 1919. He held the position of Minister for Social Welfare from 1919 to 1920. 716 References =Sources= * Universit√§tsbibliothek Regensburg - Bosls bayrische Biographie - Martin Segitz (in German) author: Karl Bosl, publisher: Pustet, page External links * Historisches Lexikon Bayerns - search results for Martin Segitz (in German) * Die bayerische SPD w√§hrend der Weimarer Republik (in German) The Bavarian SPD during the Weimar Republic - History * Picture of Martin Segitz, taken in 1919 Historisches Lexikon Bayerns Category:1853 births Category:1927 deaths Category:People from F√ºrth Category:People from the Kingdom of Bavaria Category:German religious humanists Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:Members of the 10th Reichstag of the German Empire Category:Members of the 13th Reichstag of the German Empire Category:Ministers-President of Bavaria Category:Members of the Bavarian Chamber of Deputies ","title":"Martin Segitz"},{"id":"17363753","text":"Man-prisoner hieroglyph ‚Äì iconography from predynastic Battlefield Palette. The ancient Egyptian Man-prisoner is one of the oldest hieroglyphs from Ancient Egypt. An iconographic portrayal from predynastic Egypt eventually led to its incorporation into the writing system of the Egyptian language. Not only rebels from towns or districts, but foreigners from battle were being portrayed. The nine bows concept of internal ancient Egyptian rebels, as well as 'foreign' rebels, began with actual bows, for example under Pharaoh Djoser's feet on his seated statue, 3rd Dynasty; (his feet rest upon 9 bows). The more prolonged use of the 'prisoner' hieroglyph in language and iconography continued into New Kingdom, and Ptolemaic times with the prisoner hieroglyph, as a \\"foreign rebel people\\" presented and named inside of a \\"cartouche\\". The 'cartouche' was often identified on its perimeter ring with the fortifying blocks of a city fortification, representing either the people, or their city-state location. Example from the Hierakonpolis Palette One of the oldest examples of the Man-prisoner hieroglyph is found on the predynastic palette, the Battlefield Palette. As some of the palettes involved animals, hunting, and weapons, captives were taken and displayed. Since the prisoners are shown, battles are implied. The famous Libyan Palette shows towns or districts, surrounded by enclosures, presumed walled fortifications, against outside forces or people. Language usage of Man-prisoner hieroglyph Since Egyptian walled reliefs often told stories, battle descriptions with prisoners is common. Of note, stories, and hieroglyphs of piled dismembered body parts are known, partially to show proof of the body counts. =3000 years later: Rosetta Stone use= The Rosetta Stone, (the surviving second half, the Nubayrah Stele being the surviving first half), lists 22 reasons for honoring the pharaoh Ptolemy V-(Ptolemy Epiphanous-(with pr (hieroglyph) Eucharistos - the Greek on the stone), and the first third of the Rosetta Stone ends the list of 22. Line 1 summarizes what to do with the rebels from the town-(district): to display them on stakes (in the Demotic script) so everybody will be shown the example). The Nubayrah Stele uses four of the second version of the Man-prisoner hieroglyph, first in line N-19, and three times in line N-22, near the summary of the rebel story. Line 1 of the Rosetta Stone tells of the impaling on the stakes-(the branch hieroglyph). Shoshenq I portrayed 39 cartouched at Karnak after his campaign.

In late Classical Greek art, ichthyocentaurs (, plural: ) were centaurine sea- beings with the upper body of a human, the lower anterior half and fore-legs of a horse, and the tailed half of a fish. The earliest example dates to the 2nd century B. C., among the friezes in the Pergamon Altar. There are further examples of Aphros and/or Bythos, the personifications of foam and abyss, respectively, depicted as ichthyocentaurs in mosaics and sculptures. The term \\"ichthyocentaur\\" is of late coinage, attributable to the Byzantine writer John Tzetzes in the 12th century. They are also referred as sea-centaur.  Nomenclature  = Origin = \\"Ichthyocentaur\\" is not a term in the vocabulary of Classical antiquity at all. The word's earliest known use occurs in the 12th century by Ioannes Tzetzes in his commentary On Lycophron, 34 and may have been coined by him., p. 329, note 7 = Meaning = Ichthyocentaur is a Triton represented as having the fore-legs of a horse, rather than just having a fish-like lower-body. Ichthyocentaur comes from two different words, ichthyo- and centaur. Ichthyo- is an adjective stem from Greek ikhthis () \\"fish\\"; centaur, from Greek kentauros (), a creature from classical mythology that has a man's upper body attached to a horse's body and legs. = Synonyms = The term or its equivalent in other European languages (, plural: Ichthyokentauren; ) has been used in classical art commentary in the modern age, and vernacular terms such as \\"sea-centaur\\" (; ) have also been interchangeably applied. Henri van de Waal (1976) placed \\"ichthyocentaur\\", \\"centaurotriton\\", and \\"sea-centaur\\" in the same iconographic group or iconclass synonymous treatment of these terms are also seen in archaeological papers., where \\"ichthyocentaur\\" and \\"sea centaur\\" are equated. Centaur-Tritons is another name for ichthyocentaurs, noted in a 19th-century reference.  Greek art  Triton on Pergamon Altar The earliest datable depiction of an ichthyocentaur is found in the relief sculptures of the Pergamon Altar (2nd century, B. C.), although the inscription labels the figure as a \\"Triton\\". and note 140, cited by , note 84. The ichthyocentaur in this relief sculpture has wings on its back; these wings are of a peculiar type which are lined with either seaweed or sea creature parts instead of feathers. Ichthyocentaurs are sometimes portrayed with a pair of pincered arms (similar to a lobster's clawed arms) emerging out of their heads. = Aphros and Bythos = Aphrodite with Bythos and Aphros.  Zeugma mosaics  A \\"Birth of Venus (Aphrodite)\\" mosaic unearthed at Zeugma, Turkey shows Aphrodite emerging from a shell, supported by two \\"sea-centaurs\\", construed as special names for Tritons, according to a paper published by the leader of the French excavation team. The mosaics bear inscriptions, identifying the sea-centaurs as Aphros (\\"Sea-Foam\\", personified) and Bythos (\\"Sea-Depths\\"). The Aphros is shown with a pair of lobster-like appendages growing out of his head, as is Bythos (see images). In the Zeugma mosaic, the elder-looking triton is labeled Aphros and the youthful-looking one is called Bythos, which is contrary to convention seen in other examples.; This mosaic dates to the 3rd century CE, and is now part of the Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology's collection, now housed in the annex named the Zeugma Mosaic Museum.  Apamea, Paphos and others In the marine procession mosaic found underneath a cathedral at Apamea, Syria (c. 362-363 CE), there is an Aphros in ichthyocentaur form.. Fig. 5; Fig. 7 This Aphros (identified by inscription) is depicted as a youthful triton with lobster-like antennae on its head and hair of seaweed. Bythos also appears in the same group; he evidently appears old-aged and the commentator remarks this is none other than the \\"Old Man of the Sea\\".. Fig. 9 Thetis (center), Bythos (center bottom). The Paphos mosaic depicts Bythos alone carrying the nereid Thetis along with two other nereids, Doris and Galateia. The two sea gods also appear in a pair of matching sculptures (belonging to the Louvre and Vatican Museums) depicting them carrying silen companions of the god Dionysus after his company was driven into the sea by King Lycurgus of Thrace.  Aphros in glosses  Aphros is glossed as a king of Ancient Libya and the progenitor of the Aphroi (or Carthaginians) according to the entry in the Byzantine lexicon, the Suda.\\"\\", Suda On Line\\", tr. Jennifer Benedict. 5 June 2001. A mosaic uncovered in Tunisia confirms this belief; it depicts a pair of African sea gods swimming alongside Poseidon's chariot‚Äîone is the ichthyocentaur Aphros and the other a twin-tailed Triton, god of the Libyan Lake Tritonis. The Suda also states this Aphros was the son of Cronos and Philyra. This matches the parentage of the centaur Chiron, who was the son of the Titan Cronos and the nymph Philyra (Bibliotheke of Pseudo-Apollodorus 1.2) from which it might be deduced this Aphros and Chiron were siblings. Aphros was perhaps regarded as Aphrodite's foster-father, given their similarity in names. = Other examples = The monochrome mosaic Ishthmia (2nd century CE or later), included an ichthyocentaur-form Triton on the upper panel and a winged-form Triton on the lower; both these beardless Tritons were depicted with a pair of what look like crustacean pincers growing out of their heads. and Plates 97‚Äì99 A pair of marine thiasos fresco fragments in Herculaneum have been described, such that in one fragment, are two tritons, one of them an ichthyocentaur. The ichthyocentaur here is beardless, and bears a ribboned trident. A pair of sea crayfish (lobster) feet or pincers sprout from each triton's head. In the second fragment, a youthful ichthyocentaur proceeds ahead of a mounted Venus marina; the ichthyocentaur holds two objects difficult to identify.  Literary examples  One late literary example that has been noted is the poem by Claudian (d. 404), the Epithalamium for the wedding of Honorius and Maria, in which Venus rides Triton on her back as her whole procession heads for the wedding. Here Triton is described as follows \\"The dread monster uprose from the abyss; his billowing hair swept his shoulders; hoofs of cloven horn grown round with bristles sprang from where his fishy tail joined his man's body\\". Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher observed that this Triton (with cloven hooves) is being described as an ichthyocentaur subtype with a bull's forelegs.  Renaissance period  Konrad Gesner's \\"sea- satyr\\" or \\"sea-Pan\\" was also described as an \\"ichthyocentaur\\" or \\"sea-devil\\" in his chapter on tritons in his Historia animalium IV (1558).Gesner, Konrad (1558) Historiae animalium , p. 1197; (1604 ed.) p. 1001. In the German translated edition, this creature is called \\"Meerteuffel ['sic.]\\" or \\"sea devil\\".Gesner, Konrad (1558) , p. 153 This \\"marine daemon\\" (), with other names such as \\"sea Pan monster\\", \\"monstrous sea satyr\\" or \\"centaur-fish\\" has also been used on heraldic devices. via EEBO See also *Onocentaur *Hippocampus (mythology)  Explanatory notes   References  ;Citation ;Bibliography   . , L'Erma di Bretschneider.

The area served as an important trading point and included a sawmill, a gristmill, a blacksmith, hotel, and various stores. Slightly predating Rockville's establishment, a log schoolhouse was built in 1843. This would be rebuilt in brick after burning down ten years after its founding. During this era, Rockville served as a stagecoach stop for those heading west of the Mississippi River. The Rockville post office opened June 15, 1846 with Olmstead serving as postmaster, and a hotel was opened for travelers of the Western Stage Company. The town's popularity even saw Charles W.

In 385 BC Sparta attacked Mantinea claiming they had failed to fulfil their allied obligations. When Sparta took the city they split it into four settlements, as that was what it had used to be. In the north the city of Olynthus grew in power and violated the terms agreed upon at the end of the Corinthian War. Because of this Sparta sent an army against the city under the command of Phoebidas. When the army was in Boeotia around 383 or 382 BCE, Leontiades, who was leader of the oligarchic party in Thebes, asked Phoebidas to occupy the Theban Citadel as Leontiades felt threatened by the democratic party. The Spartans were ruled by kings and, therefore, were supportive of oligarchic governments in other Greek cities. Because of this Phoebidas agreed, occupying the city and practically taking control of Thebes. Outbreak of the War 220px Upon the seizure of the Theban citadel by the Spartans, Pelopidas and other leading Theban democrats fled to Athens where Pelopidas took the lead in a conspiracy to liberate Thebes. In 379 BCE the democratic party surprised and killed their chief political opponents in Thebes (members of the aristocratic party that supported the Spartans), and roused the people against the Spartan garrison, which surrendered to an army gathered by Pelopidas.Kennell (2010), p. 139 A Spartan expedition against Thebes was mounted, led by the Agiad Spartan king Cleombrotus. It achieved little but left a garrison in Thespiae under Sphodrias.Kennell (2010), p. 140 That winter Sphodrias attempted a raid on Piraeus which ended in a fiasco.Kennell (2010), p. 140 Sphodrias had not acted under orders and was brought to trial. However, he was acquitted, which led Athens to declare for Thebes.The Historians' History of the World, vol. 4, p. 140 The War The Spartan Eurypontid king Agesilaus led two expeditions against Thebes but achieved little.The Historians' History of the World, vol. 4, p. 142 It is likely that the Dema wall was built at this time to defend Attica.Mark H. Munn, The Defense of Attica: The Dema Wall and the Boiotian War of 378-375 BC (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993) An expedition in 376 BCE led by King Cleombrotus was blocked at the passes of Cithaeron.The Historians' History of the World, vol. 4, p. 142 As the Spartans failed to get over the Cithaeron Mountains, this gave the Thebans the chance to take the attack to the Spartans, and in doing so they conquered the Spartans' remaining strongholds in Boeotia while the Spartan base in Thespiae was also lost. The Spartans were only left with some land in the south and Orchomenus in the north-west. Because the Spartans were having a hard time attacking Thebes over land, they decided to change their strategy and rather use a naval force to try and block support for the Athenians. In response, the Athenians sent a powerful fleet towards Sparta. The Spartan general Pollis then led his small fleet to try and stop the siege, but was killed during a naval battle against the Athenian general Chabrias. This naval victory was the first ever victory by an Athenian naval fleet since the Peloponnesian War. Later in 376 BCE Chabrias raided Laconia, and possibly reached Sellasia which is to the north- east of Sparta. In 375 BCE Athens mounted two successful expeditions - one into the northern Aegean under Chabrias and a second which sailed around the Peloponnese to western Greece. This force was led by Timotheos, son of Conon, who won the battle of Alyzeia in Acarnania.Agesilaos, P Cartledge p377 Ancient Boeotia In 375 BCE there was a renewal of the King's Peace, but this lasted but a few months.Kennell (2010), p. 142 The capture of Plataea by the Thebans put the Theban-Athenian Alliance under strain,Kennell (2010), p. 142 as the Plataeans were expelled from their city and found asylum in Athens, where they were a strong voice against Thebes.The history of ancient Greece: its colonies and conquests, from the earliest, By John Gillies p 323 Though the alliance held, Athens insisted on negotiations with Sparta.Kennell (2010), p. 142 A peace treaty was agreed but significant disagreements arose at the treaty signing. Epaminondas insisted that he should sign for the Boeotians as a whole rather than just for Thebes. In response, the Spartan king Agesilaus struck the name of Thebes off the list of signatories.Kennell (2010), pp. 142-143 Both sides then left the conference and prepared for renewed hostilities. As a result of the failure to come to terms with Thebes, the Spartans under Cleombrotus marched against Thebes in 371 BC however were defeated at Leuctra by the Boeotians led by the Thebans. Due to this battle, Spartan supremacy was effectively overthrown and a new era of Theban hegemony was set up.Kennell (2010), pp. 143-145 In 370 BC Epaminondas invaded the Peloponnese but the Spartans refused to engage his now superior army in battle. Instead of marching on Sparta, Epaminondas set up the city of Megalopolis and re-founded the city of Messene, an old enemy of Sparta. Having two new powerful enemies close to its capital severely limited Sparta‚Äôs power. He launched a second expedition in 369 BC but not much was achieved on either side. Meanwhile Pelopidas was active in Thessaly as many cities there had asked for help against the tyrannical ruler of Thessaly, Alexander of Pherae. In his first expedition Pelopidas was successful but after further complaints about Alexander‚Äôs rule he was sent again, this time as an ambassador. Alexander had him imprisoned. In 368 BC Thebes sent an army into Thessaly to deal with Alexander, with Epaminondas serving as a soldier due to his enemies in Thebes blocking his election to Boeotarch. The army failed to defeat Alexander and was saved from destruction by Epaminondas who led the retreat. In 367 BC another army this time under the full command of Epaminondas was sent into Thessaly. Epaminondas outmanoeuvred Alexander and got him to release the prisoners without much of a fight. Pelopidas now had a hatred for Alexander and would eventually return with an army. He defeated Alexander in the Battle of Cynoscephalae but in his haste to kill the tyrant was himself killed. Alexander was then forced to make peace with Thebes As Thebes grew in power, more Greek states began to oppose it, chief among them Athens, who now feared Thebes. Another was Mantinea, a city in the Peloponnese who began to act against Thebes. In 362 BC Epaminondas and his Arcadian allies marched against Mantinea, who was supported by Sparta and Athens. The Spartans has been rebuilding their army and decided to fight Epaminondas at Mantinea. In the resulting battle the Thebans won the day but at an extremely heavy cost, including the loss of Epaminondas himself. The death of their leader convinced the Thebans to seek peace and pursue a more defensive policy in the future. By the end of the war Spartan supremacy had been broken but Thebes were no longer in a position to fill the vacuum. Athens was once again the most powerful state in Greece but only by a small margin and they wouldn‚Äôt be powerful enough to combat the rise of Macedon in the following years.
