Origins The family took its name from the manor of Cogan, in Glamorgan, Wales, now a suburb of Penarth, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) south west of Cardiff. The Liber Niger Scutarii of 1166 recorded Milo as holding Cogan as two knight's fees, under the overlordship of William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester (d.1183). Career In 1170 Milo was one of the knights who sailed in Strongbow's expedition of conquest to Ireland. He was appointed constable of Dublin Castle. On the invaders having become besieged in the city by the native Irish, Cogan led a sally outside the castle walls and defeated the besiegers, thus the siege was raised due to his distinguished action. In 1177 he was granted, jointly with Robert FitzStephen (d.1183), the Kingdom of Cork, to be held by the feudal tenure of 60 knight's fees. Marriage and children He married Christiana Paynel, a daughter of Fulk II Paynel (d.1208), feudal baron of Bampton, Devon.Sanders, I.J., English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, p.5, note 4, quoting Cokayne, THe Complete Peerage, new edition, III, p.357 His children included: *William de Cogan, his heir as tenant of Cogan, who at some time before 1182 witnessed three charters of Margam Abbey, Glamorgan. He was appointed constable of Neath Castle, Glamorgan, at some time after 1184. *Another possible relative was John de Cogan, who granted land in Penarth to St Augustine's Abbey in Bristol. Death Milo de Cogan was killed in 1182 during an affray in Desmond. Later succession The succession can be traced through the history of the Feudal barony of Bampton. *Richard de Cogan (thought to have been the son of William de Cogan, son of Miles), in 1207 received large grants of land in Ireland. The descent from him was as follows: *John I de Cogan (d.1278). In the extent made in 1262 he was recorded as holding two fees in Cogan, valued at ¬£10. In 1267 he obtained the feudal barony of Bampton in Devon, surrendered to him after the death of Edmund of Lancaster (d.1296), who had taken it into his wardship following the death of Auda Paynel (d.1261), wife of John II de Ballon (d.1275) of Much Marcle, Herefordshire, and heiress of the Paynel barony of Bampton.Sanders gives John de Cogan's date of death as 1302, and whose subsequent pedigree differs from that given by the Inventory of Ancient Monuments in Glamorgan, Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments in Wales. The Devon historian Tristram Risdon (d.1640) stated that at Bampton the Cogans \\"had...a very stately house and kept great entertainment when they lived here, and having greater possessions in Ireland for the most part dwelt there\\".Risdon, Tristram, Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, p.64 *John II de Cogan. (son). He received livery of his inheritance in 1280/1 and was still alive in 1320 when recorded as a tenant in the survey made in that year by Hugh Despencer, Lord of Glamorgan. *(a later descendant) Richard de Cogan (d.1368/9) *John III de Cogan (d.1389), only son and last in the male line. His heir to his lands in Ireland, Devon and Somerset was his sister Elizabeth.

The song Tolko s Toboy (With You Only) was included in the Putumayo World Music compilation (featuring also Peter Gabriel, Gipsy Kings, Bob Marley, Johnny Clegg among others) which led to Farlanders‚Äô traveling to the USA when they toured the East Coast, starting in Washington DC. The tour's high point was the band‚Äôs performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics' opening ceremony. Inozemets (Foreigner, 1998) CD, recorded in the Netherlands and released by Moscow GreenWave Records, came out in the USA under the title Inna and the Farlanders. Later that year the band played at the WOMEX (Worldwide Music Expo) forum in Stockholm. Live album Moments, recorded in Bremen, Germany, came out in 2000 on GreenWave. In 2001 the German Jaro Medien record label released Winter in Moscow CD, recorded in the early 1990s by Zhelannaya, Starostin and Norvegian singer Mari Boine. It was followed by Tantsy Teney (Shadows' Dances, 2001), an acoustic set of songs written by Sergey Kalachyov based on Inna's lyrics. Another studio album Vymysly (Fairytales) featuring Russian folk songs came out in January 2004 on GreenWave. Farlanders' jubilee 2004 concert celebrating the band's 10 years career (it was released on DVD in 2006, as –ò–Ω–Ω–∞ –ñ–∞–ª–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏ Farlanders) proved to be their last: the band broke up to reunite just once, on April 2, 2005, to perform at the Goldenmask theater festival, with Trey Gunn, whom Inna played with in 2004. Gunn also played on three songs of Inna Zhelannaya's Kokon (The Cocoon, 2008) CD. Before that in 2006 the singer joined the band Maler–∏—è to record the album 77RUS which came out in June of that year. In 2013, Inna Zhelannaya started working with a new band featuring Sergey 'Grebstel' Kalachov (bass), Oleg Maryakhin (saxophone, electronics), Dmitry Frolov (drums) and Vladimir Goubatov (sound engineer, referred to as a band member), her new songs combining elements of folk, progressive rock, jazz, trance, electronic, and psychedelia. Zhelannaya's double album Izvorot (The Bending) came out in October 2014, to some critical acclaim. \\"It's as if King Crimson would have approached the traditional musical folklore rooted out of the deepest Russian backwood,\\" a Russian Rolling Stone reviewer opined.The (Russian) Rolling Stones review of Izvorot album On 18 May 2017 Zhelannaya and Kalachov (now, drums and arrangements) presented their new art and music project called VILY (–í–ò–õ–´, Pitchfork), featuring three more modern folk female singers, Margarita Kozheurova, Svetlana Lobanova and Alyona Lifshits.Inna Zhelannaya.

The 41-bed establishment, which opened in the 1960s, was the inspiration for Fawlty Towers, a British situation comedy first broadcast in the mid-1970s. John Cleese, and his then wife Connie Booth, were inspired to write the series after they had stayed at the hotel and witnessed the eccentric behaviour of its owner, Donald Sinclair (who sold the hotel in 1973). Later the hotel was managed by Best Western. In February 2015 the hotel closed. It will be replaced by retirement apartments.  History  The Gleneagles was not originally built as a hotel but was modified to become one. The hotel was first opened in 1963 and was managed by Donald Sinclair . It was initially described as \\"upmarket\\" because it advertised private bathrooms in every room. In the early 1970s, cast members of Monty Python's Flying Circus stayed at the Gleneagles for a planned three weeks, while filming in Paignton. Due to Sinclair's rudeness towards them, which included criticising Terry Gilliam's \\"too American\\" table etiquette and tossing Eric Idle's briefcase out of a window \\"in case it contained a bomb\\", the cast left the hotel apart from John Cleese and his wife, Connie Booth. Cleese described Sinclair as \\"the most marvellously rude man I've ever met\\" and based his Basil Fawlty character on him when he and Booth created Fawlty Towers five years later. Sinclair sold the Gleneagles in 1973. For the rest of its existence, the hotel retained a reminder of Sinclair's legacy: the 41 rooms all had names such as Coral or Mimosa. This was introduced in the Sinclair era of Gleneagles. In August 2003, developers submitted plans to demolish the hotel and build a block of flats on the site, claiming the building was \\"unattractive with little architectural merit\\". In October, Torbay Town Council rejected the application, claiming that it would be against its rules of tourism. In September 2006, Prunella Scales, who played Sybil Fawlty, was \\"guest of honour\\" at the reopening of the hotel after a ¬£1,000,000 makeover. The hotel was a part of the Best Western hotel chain. After the hotel was closed permanently in February 2015, permission was given in November 2015 to demolish the hotel and replace it with retirement apartments, to be built by Churchill Retirement Living.  In popular culture  The Gleneagles Hotel is mentioned in \\"The Builders\\" episode of Fawlty Towers as a suggestion for alternative dinner arrangements for the guests while Fawlty Towers was undergoing renovations.

He was a professor of music history at the University of Heidelberg from 1981 to 1995 and editor of the encyclopedia Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart. He is respected internationally as an authority on the history of Western Classical music from the 16th century to contemporary classical music, with a view on music in cultural, social, historical and philosophical context, in a clear language for both specialists and lay readers.  Life and career  Born in Kassel, the youngest of five siblings, Finscher studied musicology, English, German and philosophy at the University of G√∂ttingen from 1949 to 1954. Students at the same time included Gerhard Croll, Carl Dahlhaus and Rudolf Stephan. He earned a doctorate with a thesis about the masses and motets by Loyset Comp√®re, with advisor Rudolf Gerber. From 1954, he worked for the Deutsches Volksliedarchiv (German archive of folk songs) in Freiburg im Breisgau. He returned to G√∂ttingen in 1955, working as a freelance journalist and music critic. He became a scientific assistant to Walter Wiora in 1960, first at the University of Kiel and from 1965 at the University of Saarbr√ºcken. In 1967 he obtained his habilitation in Saarbr√ºcken with the work Das klassische Streichquartett und seine Grundlegung durch Joseph Haydn (The classical string quartet and its foundation by Joseph Haydn). From 1968 to 1981, he held a chair for musicology at the University of Frankfurt, and from 1981 until his retirement in 1995 the same position at the University of Heidelberg. Finscher was president of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Musikforschung (Society for music research) from 1974 to 1977 and the International Musicological Society from 1977 to 1981. He died in Wolfenb√ºttel on 30 June 2020 at the age of 90.  Research work  One of Finscher's most important accomplishments was his editing, beginning in 1994, of the new edition of the encyclopaedia Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart in 28 volumes, for which he wrote or updated some 40 articles. His extensive works on string quartets, chamber music and Joseph Haydn are regarded as musicological standards, as is the two-volume Music of the 15th and 16th centuries. Finscher contributed to the complete editions of the works of Christoph Willibald Gluck, W. A. Mozart, and Paul Hindemith. He was also co-editor of the Capellae Apostolicae Sixtinaeque Collectanea Acta Monumenta. He published over 130 articles in anthologies and journals, aiming for simple wording accessible to lay readers as well as specialists.

He was one of the best European two-year-olds of 1980, when he won the Coventry Stakes by five lengths and the Grand Crit√©rium in France. In the following year he won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, but was beaten in his last three starts. In all, he recorded five wins and five placings in a career of thirteen races. He was retired to become a breeding stallion in Kentucky, but had little success as a sire of winners. Background Recitation was a \\"big, well-made\\" bay horse with a white blaze and two white socks bred in Ohio by Marvin Warner Sr. He was from the first crop of foals sired by the 1976 Preakness Stakes winner Elocutionist. Recitation's dam Irish Party won nine races and became a successful broodmare: her other descendants include the Breeders' Cup Classic winner Volponi. As a yearling, the colt was offered for sale and bought for $35,000. He entered the ownership of Mr A. Bodie and was sent to Europe where he was trained by Guy Harwood at Pulborough in West Sussex. At the time, Harwood was noted for his modern approach to training, introducing Britain to features such as artificial gallops and barn-style stabling. Racing career=1980: two- year-old season After finishing third over five furlongs on his racecourse debut, Recitation won a maiden race over the same distance at Newbury Racecourse, beating I'll See You by half a length. The colt was then moved up sharply in class for the Group Three Coventry Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot in June in which he was ridden by Greville Starkey and started at odds of 11/1. In a performance which Timeform described as \\"a revelation\\", Recitation took the lead a quarter mile from the finish and drew clear of the field to win easily by five lengths from Motavato, Bel Bolide and Another Realm. The form of the race was subsequently boosted when the third and fourth placed horses won the Gimcrack Stakes and the Richmond Stakes respectively. In the July Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse Recitation started 2/5 favourite against two opponents, but was beaten two and a half lengths by Age Quod Agis. After a break of two months, Recitation returned in the Westhampnett Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in September. In a race run in thick fog, Recitation led until the final furlong, but was caught and beaten a neck by Clear Verdict. Later in the month he was moved up in distance for the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Ascot. In a strong field Recitation finished second to the Seaton Delaval Stakes winner Robellino, with the Champagne Stakes winner Gielgud in third and Beldale Flutter in fourth. On 12 October, Recitation was sent to France to contest that country's most prestigious two-year-old race, the Group One Grand Crit√©rium over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. He started a 14/1 outsider in a field of eleven, with the betting being headed by the Prix des Ch√™nes winner Dunphy and the Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte winner Cresta Rider. Starkey restrained the colt at the back of the field and turned into the straight in ninth placed. Recitation was then switched to the outside and produced a strong late run to dispute the lead 200m from the finish and won by a short-head from the Irish-trained Critique. On his final appearance of the year, Recitation returned to England for the William Hill Futurity at Doncaster Racecourse. Running less than two weeks after his win in Paris, he finished fourth behind Beldale Flutter, Shergar and Sheer Grit. 1981: three-year-old season Recitation began his three-year-old season in the Group Three 2000 Guineas Trial Stakes over seven furlongs at Salisbury Racecourse and won easily by two lengths from Tahoe and Dalby Mustang. With the Harwood stable relying on To-Agori-Mou in the 2000 Guineas, Recitation was sent to contest the French equivalent, the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp on 26 April. Cresta Rider started favourite, with Recitation second choice in the betting on 2.4/1. Starkey settled the colt just behind the leaders before moving through on the inside to take the lead on the turn into the straight. He quickly went clear of the field and won easily by two and a half lengths from Redoubtable, with Cresta Rider in third. Recitation returned to France for the Prix du Jockey Club on 7 June at Chantilly Racecourse. He was never in contention and dead-heated for seventh place behind Bikala. The colt was brought back in distance for the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp on 4 July but showed no improvement, finishing sixth behind The Wonder. In Autumn he was brought back to seven furlongs for the Harroways Stakes and finished second to the four-year-old Belmont Bay. Assessment In 1980, the independent Timeform organisation gave Recitation a rating of 126, eight pounds below the top-rated juvenile Storm Bird. In the official International Classification he was rated six pounds below Storm Bird and was the joint- highest-rated two-year-old to race in France. In the following year he was rated 124 by Timeform, sixteen pounds below Shergar. The International Classification rated him the twelfth-best three-year-old colt in Europe. Stud record Recitation was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Ashford Stud in Kentucky, starting at a fee of $40,000 a foal. He was later exported to stand as a stallion in Japan. He was not a success at stud, with his best winner being Country Recital who won the Grade III Chrysanthemum Handicap in 1986.

The 70-foot vessel was designed specifically to carry out research on cetaceans (and other marine fauna) using benign research techniques such as passive acoustic monitoring. Description Song of the Whale is a cutter-rigged steel-hulled research vessel commissioned by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and built in 2004. The vessel was designed by Rogers Yacht Design of Lymington and built to Lloyd's Special Service Craft Rules for world-wide service - the first sailing vessel to meet those standards for 30 years. Ordered from Blondecell Ltd, the subcontracted steel hull was fabricated by Corus Steel and assembled by Riverside Fabrication at Falmouth, Cornwall. The addition of the composite superstructure and the full outfitting was carried out at Blondecell's facility at Cracknore Hard, Marchwood, Hampshire. The vessel cost ¬£1.5 million. The design minimises acoustic emissions to facilitate the benign research techniques favoured by her former owners IFAW and the engine-room is encased in a Faraday cage to contain electrical fields. The outfit of Song of the Whale includes the latest computerised recording and tracking devices to ensure that best and most advanced acoustic research can be carried out. To assist physical observation, there is a two-person crow's nest. The new vessel was launched in St Katharine Docks, London, on 6 June 2004 by Pierce and Keely Brosnan. Operation Song of the Whale was formerly owned by IFAW until 14 March 2014 when the vessel was granted to Marine Conservation Research International of Kelvedon, UK. She is based at Ipswich and continues to carry out the research for which she designed, using benign techniques. She replaced a smaller vessel of the same name, a converted 46-foot luxury yacht, which had been in service for 17 years. Song of the Whale carries out most of its research under sail to reduce the impact on the whales and other marine mammals being researched. The focus of projects is on their presence, distribution, movements and behaviour. Noise suppression is particularly important when assessing populations of whales as the researchers can listen to their sounds up to 20 miles away using hydrophone arrays, not relying solely on surface sightings. Research undertaken is focused on the conservation of threatened species and habitats and includes work on the problems of underwater noise, whales becoming entangled in fishing gear or in collisions with ships.

Synopsis The Monsoon Oracle is an intimate portrayal of the central festival of Telangana, called Bonalu. It narrates stories of women and men who dedicate their lives to enacting the roles the Hindu goddess Mahankali‚Äôs oracles and to the role of Pothuraju, the goddess's whip wielding brother. It presents an insight into extraordinary ritualistic practices that are performed every year in India in the hope of a bountiful Monsoon and explores the emotional and psychological dimensions of these annual role enactments. Their stories reveal the relationship between the effective charge of a religious crowd and an extreme form of animal sacrifice. The Film also delves into themes of modernization, commercialization, and politicization of religion in modern India. The dialogue in the film takes place in TelanganaTelugu with English subtitles. The narration is in English. In an Interview with Deccan Chronicle, Shrenik said > \\"It's about people, their stories, their tradition of predicting monsoons > and the oracles. The idea germinated as I watched a report on a local news > channel. I decided to pursue it because of the contrast the traditions > offered against the backdrop of a high tech Hyderabad\\".

He is the face of the annual multi-media charity event Serious Request.  Career  Eric Corton is an educated actor on the Maastricht Academy of Dramatic Arts, but he is a common celebrity and television personality in the Netherlands, not specifically known as an actor. He sang and played guitar for the now extinct bands Eric Corton Trio and Tacker. Despite his thorough acting background, Eric got known as a diskjockey at Dutch radio station 3FM before anything else, while his characteristic voice was used in numerous commercials too.  Acting  In 1995 Corton featured in the Veronica-series '20 Plus'. He met his wife Diana Sno on the set of that show. He was also part of the a comedy company called Purper, which played in theaters. He has also played in several Dutch movies and television series, but due to other commitments these have not been big, substantial roles. Most characters he played were either for his warm voice, or his typical masculine appearance. He did bring his theater and acting experience to the spotlight already, but not with great acknowledgment. That would rapidly changed when in 2012 he got cast for the series Penoza, alongside the much laurelled actress Monic Hendrickx, in a cast featuring several top-rated actors in the Netherlands. In the series, he plays the character of John de Weerd, a big-hearted, withdrawn and loving man, who would not harm a fly, but who is married to a Carmen (played by Monic Hendrickx) who gets dragged deeper and deeper into the world of the international organized crime against her own will, due to the mistakes her late husband and brother had made. The character of John strongly disapproves of the actions his wife has to take, but he lets her, out of his eyesight. In the meanwhile he takes care of both her and his sons from prior relationships, as well as Camen's orphaned grandson.  Presenting In 2002 and 2003 Eric was the voice over for Robot Wars: The Dutch Battles, a spin-off from the British television show. He also presented ‚ÄòDe Garage‚Äô for another broadcaster than BNN, namely VPRO and several radio shows.  DJ  Eric is a well-known radio host and DJ. Partly due to his remarkable features, among which several tattoos, including on his hands, he is embraced by the Dutch rock scene, more than any other radio DJ. He is also an avid supporter of live music, using his radio station to promote Dutch live bands on any given occasion. One of the bands that profited from Eric's support is Voicst, which he aired on any occasion for a long period of time on his radio shows.  Music  Eric is a well- known rock fan and has testified on this in several interviews. Eric Corton en Giel Beelen, Pinkpop 2007.jpgHe was a guest as fan of Queens of the Stone Age on Dutch television show De Wereld Draait Door, which is the biggest daily talkshow of the Netherlands. The same report also featured politician Esther Ouwehand. Eric has had a career as a musician himself too. The highlight in Eric's career was his band Tacker. Tacker review at Lords of Metal webzine He also was part of the eponymous band Eric Corton Trio He also shared the stage with Seasick Steve and the Belgian rockband Triggerfinger at the Pinkpop Festival, being humorously announced as \\"the most handsome grey man from Holland\\", by Triggerfinger singer Ruben Blok. Eric Corton is co-initiator of Cortonville,Article about Cortonville on musicfrom.nl a live music platform for Dutch musicians, including albumreviews, interviews, reports, backgrounds, concertregistrations. Cortonville also organizes music events and small tours, in which new and coming bands are often given a change to display themselves to bigger audiences they would have had by their own power.  Writing Eric Corton has a big love for cars. He has owned many cars and said about this on Dutch television: I can fall in love with a car, but when I see another one I fall in love with, my current car has to go. That‚Äôs my form of infidelity like a rock star, while I treat my actual wife with a lot more respect and devotion. He wrote down a lifetime of stories, following the cars he then possessed, suitably dubbed ‚ÄòEric Corton: Auto-Biography‚Äô, which was released in 2013. He had written a lesser known book before in 2010, named ‚ÄòWilde Wereld‚Äô (which means \\"wild world\\"), about African Stories. This was Eric‚Äôs debut as an author and it displays the stories, often very touching of nature, he heard by African children for his work as ambassador for The Red Cross.  Trivia In 2011 he received the \\"Pop Media Award\\". The jury described him as a \\"musician, DJ, program maker, tv-presenter, and an advocate for alternative music on stations that usually don't pay attention to is in particular\\". He officially married a couple as a special Civil registry servant. He did this in 2007, in the Glass House, after an auction for Serious Request. Eric Corton is an official The Red Cross ambassador. He travels to Africa to show the Dutch viewers what this year's theme for Serious request is and why it is important. This gave him the officious title \\"mister Serious Request\\". Despite being born in 1969 he works for BNN, which explicitly aims at a teenage and young adult audience. Besides hosting shows, he is the voice- over or announcement voice for most of the BNN radio and television shows. Private life Eric Corton is married to actress Diana Sno.

With its length of , it is one of the longest passenger-carrying aerial tramway lines in the world. There are four supporting towers located between the two terminals. The aerial tram consists of two passenger cabins, each capable of carrying 80 passengers. Two fixed track cables are for support while one loop of cable, solidly connected to the cabins, is for haulage. An electric motor drives the haulage rope, which provides propulsion. When the cabins arrive at the end stations, the cable loop stops and reverses direction so that the cars shuttle back and forth between the terminals. The base station is located between the towns of √áamyuva and Tekirova in Kemer district at altitude and about south of Antalya. The mountain station offers a panoramic view of the Mediterranean coast from Finike in the southwest and Side in the northeast, and features a restaurant and gift shops. In case of a power supply cut, a hydrostatic emergency power system ensures safe continuation of operations. Passengers can be evacuated by ropes at locations where the cabin is not very high from the ground. Evacuation of passengers is also possible by small emergency cabins capable of carrying 25 people, or by helicopter in good weather. Mt.

The law authorizes clinical research and the revision of rules about organ donation and transportation as a result of the research. Organs from HIV donors would only be going to individuals who are already HIV positive, but could lead to 600 additional organ transplants a year. The use of HIV-positive organs was previously a federal crime. This bill passed the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress, and also passed the United States House of Representatives. It was signed into law as PL 113-51 by President Barack Obama on November 21, 2013. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act revised the Organ Transplant Amendments Act of 1988, a law that prevented patients from receiving organs from HIV positive people. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act shortened organ transplant wait times, including the wait times for people without HIV as more HIV positive patients receive organs. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act amends the Public Health Service Act to repeal the requirement that the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network adopt and use standards of quality for the acquisition and transportation of donated organs that include standards for preventing the acquisition of organs infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The bill replaces this requirement with authorization for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to adopt and use such standards with respect to organs infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), provided that any such standards ensure that organs infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who are: (1) infected with such virus before receiving such an organ; and (2) participating in clinical research approved by an institutional review board under the criteria, standards, and regulations regarding organs infected with HIV developed under this Act or, if participation in such research is no longer warranted, receiving a transplant under such standards and regulations. The bill would revise similarly the requirement that organ procurement organizations arrange for testing to prevent the acquisition of organs infected with the AIDS etiologic agent to require that they arrange for testing to identify organs infected with HIV. The bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and publish guidelines for the conduct of research relating to transplantation of organs from HIV-infected donors. The bill also requires the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to revise its standards of quality regarding HIV-infected organs and the Secretary to revise related regulations. The bill requires the Secretary to: (1) review annually the results of scientific research in conjunction with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to determine whether they warrant revision of quality standards relating to donated HIV-infected organs and to the safety of transplantation of organs with a particular strain of HIV into a recipient with a different strain; and (2) direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, if the review so warrants, to revise its standards in a way that ensures the changes will not reduce the safety of organ transplantation. Finally, the bill amends the federal criminal code to declare that an organ donation does not violate the prohibition against a knowing organ donation by an HIV-infected individual if the donation is made in accordance with this Act. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on March 20, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 330 amends provisions of the Public Health Service Act that authorize the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish guidelines and quality standards for conducting research relating to donated organs and for acquiring and procuring such organs. The bill removes a provision in current law that prohibits the acquisition and procurement of donated organs that are infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. S. 330 also requires the Secretary of HHS to develop guidelines for conducting research relating to organ transplants from donors who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Secretary is required to annually review the results of the research to determine whether the results warrant revising the quality standards for acquiring and procuring donated organs. Finally, the bill authorizes the Secretary to establish standards for acquiring and procuring donated organs that are infected with HIV, provided that any such standards ensure that an organ infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who are infected with HIV before receiving such organ. To implement S. 330, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that HHS would incur administrative costs of less than $500,000 annually and about $1 million over the 2014-2018 period. Any such costs would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act was introduced into the Senate on February 14, 2013 by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D, CA). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. On June 17, 2013, the Senate voted by unanimous consent to pass the bill. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act was received in the United States House of Representatives on June 18, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act would be considered under a suspension of the rules on the House floor on November 12, 2013. Debate and discussion The Human Rights Campaign was in favor of the bill. According to the Human Rights Campaign, \\"the Act is supported by dozens of organizations that advocate on transplant policy and communities with an increased need for transplantation, including: AIDS United, amfAR, American Medical Association, American Society for Nephrology, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, American Society of Transplantation, American Society of Transplant Surgeons, Dialysis Patient Citizens, HIV Medicine Association, and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *United Network for Organ Sharing *Organ donation *HIV/AIDS Notes/ReferencesExternal links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 330 *beta.congress.gov S. 330 *GovTrack.us S. 330 *OpenCongress.org S. 330 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 330 *Congressional Budget Office report on S. 330 Category:United States federal health legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress Category:HIV/AIDS Category:Organ donation ","title":"HIV Organ Policy Equity Act"},{"id":"41050000","title":"Stockholm bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics"},{"id":"41050002","text":"Temple Beth El, also known as Temple Beth-El, is a Reform synagogue in Madison, Wisconsin, in the United States. The synagogue was founded in 1939. History The synagogue's founding rabbi was Dr. Manfred Swarsensky. He was a Holocaust survivor who emigrated from Berlin, Germany, to the United States in 1939, established the synagogue, and was the rabbi of Temple Beth El for 36 years, until he retired. At the beginning, the synagogue had 12 members. In 1950, when the synagogue had 150‚Äì200 families as members, it built the present synagogue building on land it had purchased on Arbor Drive, and dedicated the new building. By the end of Swarsensky's tenure, the synagogue had 400 families as members. The synagogue after his death created in his honor an annual lectureship, known as the \\"Swarsensky Weekend\\". Sign located near the entrance of Temple Beth El in Madison, WI Rabbi Kenneth Roseman, who has a Ph.D. in Jewish history, was the rabbi of the synagogue following Swarsensky, from 1976 to 1985. He was followed by Rabbi Jan Brahms, who served for nineteen years before deciding in 2004 to take a post at a smaller congregation in The Woodlands, Texas. Brahms was known for his interfaith activities and for his many columns on religious topics for The Capital Times newspaper. During Brahms' tenure the congregation grew from 480 families to about 700. After Brahms, Daryl Crystal served as rabbi on an interim basis until the current rabbi, Jonathan Biatch, took the position in 2005. Lawrence Kohn served as Education Director for 35 years, starting in 1979. Henry James Cargas was the first Rabbi Manfred Swarsensky Scholar at the synagogue, in 1982. In 2008, the Madison Jewish Community Day School opened in rented space at Temple Beth El. Beginning in February 2014, the synagogue hosted Beth Israel Center‚Äôs after-school services while renovations were underway at Beth Israel for six months. The synagogue had to postpone a planned group trip to Israel scheduled for August 2014 due to fighting in Israel. Rabbi Biatch said: \\"There's a great deal of disappointment. But there is optimism that we will go eventually.\\" National Football League player Gabe Carimi, now a guard and tackle for the Atlanta Falcons, and his family attended the synagogue as he grew up. Carimi celebrated his bar mitzvah at the synagogue, and helped in the synagogue's Hebrew school when he was in high school. In 2014, the synagogue had 650 member families. The congregation is a member of the Union for Reform Judaism. Its members reflect Madison‚Äôs demographic as the seat of state and county government, home of the University of Wisconsin, and a regional center for medical care, scientific research, and business.

Arapaha entered historical records with the establishment of the mission of Santa Mar√≠a de los Angeles de Arapaha in the 1620s. This mission was to the north of missions established in Timucua Province (in the original narrow sense of the territory of the Northern Utina), and northeast of Yustaga Province.

(\\"Arapaha\\" is presumed to have been changed to \\"Alapaha\\" by speakers of one of the Muskogean languages, which lack \\"r\\".) \\"Arapaha\\" likely meant \\"many houses\\" or \\"bear town\\" in the Timucuan language.

A Spanish traveler in 1630 referred to \\"Harapaha Province\\" located between Santa Isabel de Utinahica and Apalachee Province. The missions at Arapaha, Cachipile, Chamile and Chuaquin were reported to be in Northern Utina Province in 1655, but Arapaha, Cachipile and Chamile were located further from St. Augustine than were the missions of San Pedro y San Pablo de Potohiriba and Santa Elena de Machaba in Yustaga Province, which were themselves further from St. Augustine than were the southerly Northern Utina missions. The chiefs of Arapaha, Cachipile, Chamile and Chuaquin did not join the Timucua Rebellion of 1656, which was instigated by the head chief of the Northern Utina, indicating the possibility of some degree of autonomy or separation.Hann 1986: 382Hann 1996: 5, 9, 182Milanich: 93 In the wake of the Timucua Rebellion of 1656, the Spanish executed many of the chiefs of Timucua (Northern Utina), Yustaga and Potano Provinces. Many of the towns thus left leaderless were already depopulated. The Spanish pressured the chiefs and people of Arapaha, Chamile, Cachipile and Chaquin to move to towns along the royal road. The chief of Arapaha was given Santa F√© de Toloca as his chief town, as well as jurisdiction over San Francisco de Potano, San Pedro y San Pablo de Potohiriba, San Juan Guacara and other mission towns.

These grow in the forest of Verzy, 25 km south of Reims in France. In this forest are less than a thousand dwarf beeches, some dozen dwarf oaks and some dwarf chestnuts (see Biology below), but this article speaks in the main about dwarf beeches. Etymology and toponymy The word designated the beech in Old French (the plural was ); this word came from the Latin , now the French word for beech is that has a Germanic origin. These trees therefore give the name, Les Faux de Verzy, to the touristic area located in France 25 km south of Reims in Marne where the world‚Äôs largest concentration of dwarf beeches stands with about a thousand trees.  The dwarf beeches (The faux)  They are not more than high. In summer, they spread their leaves like heavy sun umbrellas; some looking like leaf igloos. In winter, their tortuous shape can be seen naked: trunks and branches are crooked, bent, twisted and pendulous to the ground. Such dwarf beeches are also known in other places: in Germany (in the S√ºntel area, not far from Hanover), in Sweden (at Dalby S√∂derskog National Park near Malm√∂, not far from the northern limit for this species), in Denmark, and in another place in France (in Lorraine). Nobody knows whether these plantings have the same origin or not. But there are too few such beeches in these two places to feel confident about the future of their population. The situation is healthier around the dwarf beeches of Verzy, especially now that the construction of a pathway enables visitors to admire them without making harmful trampling on the ground over the fragile roots. A fenced reserve also enables the preservation of a part of the population. With more than 1,000 dwarf beeches, the National Forest of Verzy is the world's principal reserve of dwarf beeches. Among them, the most specific ones were given a name inspired by their peculiar shapes: ‚Ä¢the umbrella Fau, ‚Ä¢the Fau of the bride, ‚Ä¢the ox-head Fau, ‚Ä¢the Fau of the Young Lady (the legend says that Joan of Arc came and had a rest in this forest). This area has been listed at a national level since 1932.  Pictures gallery  Image:Fau de Verzy.JPGA fau of Verzy in winter Image:Fau de Verzy.jpg... in spring Image:Verzy09.JPG... in autumn Image:Fau Verzy1.JPG... in summer  History  A mass of speculation, from far-fetched to more credible, but often scientifically unfounded, have been put forward to explain the origin of the Faux of Verzy. It is known that there were already some ‚ÄúFaux‚Äù in the forest of Verzy thanks to old books written in the abbey of St-Basle during the 6th century. The monks may have increased their number by layering and then by transplanting them in the forest to make a kind of ‚Äúbotanical garden‚Äù. These monks were great travellers and, according to Y. Bernard they may have brought back a treasured young plant from an eastern area that they were passing through for evangelizing. A dwarf beech called ( standing for meaning tree, and meaning fairy at that time) which together gives ‚Äò‚Äôthe tree of the fairies‚Äô‚Äô stood in the south of Domr√©my-la-Pucelle, the native village of Joan of Arc. This beech was already one hundred years old at that time; it was venerated because of its beauty and was the subject of rural worship: a procession used to walk there every year to chase away the bad spirits. During Joan of Arc‚Äôs trial of rehabilitation (1450-1456), 11 witnesses spoke about this very tree as if it was an essential piece of information. It was said that when going with Charles VII of France to the abbey of St Basle, Joan of Arc climbed up in the branches of a fau at Verzy and sat down. True or not, the story shows the swarm of legends which had surrounded these dwarf beeches that still are a mystery for the scientists.  Biology  The dwarf beech trees belong to the family Fagaceae as the usual common beech trees do. Their distinctive features are, apart from their shape: * their life expectancy. Not up to 800 years as it was claimed, but tree rings counts reached 350 at Verzy. * their capability of anastomosis (self welding of branches, even between different beeches and trees of different species as oaks). * their easiness in natural layering. *their seeds are rare and their rate of germination is lower than 10%. Furthermore, only 40% of these 10% will be dwarf beeches. A genetic mutation is now the most probable hypothesis to explain the dwarf aspect of these trees. This mutation may have occurred spontaneously or could have been introduced by a pathogenic agent centuries ago, the mutation would be stable and hereditary. Friedrich Lange proposes the hypothesis of a recessive mutation. He based this conclusion on the appearance inside a forest of common beech trees in the neighborhood of an old colonisation of disappeared dwarf beech trees of spontaneous seedling of dwarf trees. According to Lange, that is an out turn of the recessive characteristic actual in heterozygote coming from a common beech. The hypothesis of a temporary adaptation ( in French) due to the local environment, still frequently in favour in the area, can‚Äôt be taken on because this adaptation is not genetically stable; the dwarf beeches, when they are transplanted from Verzy to other environments or when they are grafted on a common beech tree keep their dwarf tree aspect. The earth of Verzy is poor for agriculture. Could this have led to a lineage of a distinct phenotype? No, because many beeches there are not dwarf beeches. The hypothesis of a pathogen which may have induced a mutation is compatible with the fact that there are some dwarf oak trees Quercus petraea and some dwarf chest nut trees Castanea sativa or sweet chestnut. Nevertheless, the photonic and electronic analysis with transmission carried out by J. C. Audran in 1985 failed in discovering an active presence of virus or of mollicutes (a class of small bacteria). Year after year, even stranger trees are found in this area; these ones look globally as dwarf beech trees but with a branch growing as it would do in a common beech tree. These stranger trees seem to be more frequent, they are called chimera beech trees. In 1998, by comparing the DNA coming from common beech trees, dwarf beech trees from Verzy, common purple beech trees and purple dwarf beech trees from the S√ºntel, Anita GalloisA. Gallois, J.-C. Audran, M. Burrus, Assessment of genetic relationships and population discrimination among Fagus sylvatica L. by RAPD, Theo Appl Genet, 97, 1998, - 219 working in the laboratory of biology and plant physiology in Reims University brought to light that these morphological differences are indeed there because of a genetic factor, a result that confirms the hypothesis of a mutation.  Tourism and prospect  These dwarf beeches have been taken care of for decades. The S√ºntel area is not much visited and it expands thanks to replantations and graftings. This area of Verzy belongs to the French National Forests Office and thus is visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists every year who were a threat for the survival of this variety. The forest path was diverted to turn the visitors towards some dozens of specimens protected by barriers. This low strain brought by this protection plan is justified by the pleasure to pass on these natural beauties to the future generations. Explanatory boards explain walkers-by about the importance of the safeguard of such a natural heritage. The National Institute of Agricultural Research and the Nancy botanical and gardens conservatory collect beechnuts for future uses. The laboratory in plant biology of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne proceeds in vitro micropropagations. In the Ar√®nes de Lut√®ce, in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, stands a 2 meter high dwarf beech tree belonging to the same species; it was planted in 1905.  Bibliography  * GALLOIS A., M.

Life William Swinton was born in Kirkcaldy in Fife, the son of William Wilson Swinton, a clerk, and Rachel Cargill; he had one sibling, his younger sister Mary.Swinton genealogy chart at the Swinton family website, www.swintonfamilysociety.org He received his secondary education in Dundee and Glenalmond College. From 1917, he studied Sciences at the University of Glasgow, graduating BSc in 1922. In 1920, he partook in an expedition to Spitsbergen. Between 1922 and 1924, he was an assistant at the geology department of the British Museum (Natural History) in London. Subsequently, Swinton was appointed as a curator of fossil amphibians, reptiles and birds. In 1933, he received his first doctorate (Ph.D) from the University of Glasgow. In 1932 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Douglas Alexander Allan, Robert Campbell, Herbert Harold Read and Thomas Matthew Finlay. He enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1937, and served during the entire Second World War with Navy intelligence, eventually reaching the rank of Lieutenant commander. In the late 1950s he joined an expedition to climb Mount Everest, but he failed to reach the summit. He received the Darwin Medal from the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1959. Two years later, he emigrated to Canada to take up a post in Toronto. Career at the British Museum (Natural History) At the museum, Swinton was responsible for writing a large number of museum guides and books; the latter mainly popularizing works about paleontology. One of his most famous works was The Dinosaurs from 1934.Alan Charig (1994) Obituary: Professor William Swinton, The Independent 28 June 1994. These books were translated into many languages, making him influential in determining the public perception of dinosaurs in the middle of the twentieth century. However, his ideas on the subject were formed during the eclipse of Darwinism, they were already old-fashioned in the 1930s, and this problem became worse as the books were being reprinted for decades. Career in Canada Swinton left the BMNH in 1961, to accept a post as professor of zoology at the University of Toronto, Canada. He combined this post with the directorship of the department of biology at the Royal Ontario Museum, and was soon appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 1963, he became overall director of the ROM. Under his directorship, the museum gained both in public attendance and scientific prestige.Chris McGowan & Anita McConnell, \\"Swinton, William Elgin (1900‚Äì1994)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.

In terms of its theoretical foundations, PNC combined elements or orthodox Marxism, Leninism, Trotskyism and Neo-anarchism (as inspired by Daniel Cohn- Bendit of May 1968). The economic system that existed in the USSR was viewed by PNC members as socialist, but at the same time the political system was seen as non-socialist (neo-Stalinist, bureaucratic), which, in their opinion, represented the classic conflict of Marxism: the conflict between productive forces and the relations of production, and would inevitably lead to a political revolution. PNC members believed that the victory of a group of Joseph Stalin's supporters over their political opponents in the inner-party struggle within VKP (b) in the late 1920s and early 1930s was the reason of the fundamental differences between political and economic systems. PNC set it as their objective to perform a political revolution and return the country back to pre-Stalinist ideological and political foundations. Students were thought to be the vanguard of the new revolution. PNC had neither a developed structure, nor official theoretical documents (it was expected that such documents would be adopted by the future party conference). The organisation consisted of just two groups in Moscow and one in the city of Kaliningrad (presently known as Korolyov, a city in Moscow Region). \\"The Principles of Neo-communism\\" (Russian: –ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–ø—ã –Ω–µ–æ–∫–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞) written by A. Tarasov in the form of a catechism in November 1973, served as a temporary theoretical and programme document of the party. In some theoretical issues, important from the point of view of PNC members, they were guided by Tarasov's works, written in 1973-1974 and revised after they had been discussed within PNC. Such theoretical issues included: preference of revolutionary approach to the reformist one (based on the work \\"Chile, Cyprus crisis and Eurocommunism\\"); identification of the new Soviet philistines as representatives of petite bourgeoisie and a major reactionary force in the Soviet society (based on the work \\"Swamp Rot. Black Hundreds as Revolutionary Counter-revolutionism of Petit Bourgeoisie\\"); incompatibility of representative democracy and communism, the need for direct democracy (based on the work \\"Every Man is a King\\"). None of these works have survived; they were burnt in January 1975. PNC members were engaged in sourcing, selecting and distributing illegal literature (\\"samizdat\\" and literature of the pre-Stalinist period), established contacts among students and young people, promoted their ideas through verbal propaganda (in the 1970s, such propaganda was prosecuted as felony, which carried a penalty of up to seven years in prison under Art. 70 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR). In the summer of 1974, PNC members ran a trial graffiti propaganda campaign, when they inscribed in chalk on buildings and fences about fifteen messages that read \\"Revolution ‚Äì here and now!\\", \\"Remove the seniles from power!\\", \\"Ten years is enough!\\" (referring to long years of Brezhnev's term in office). The campaign proved to be a failure: the inscriptions were fairly dull in colour and were easily washed away by rain. It was decided to abandon the use of graffiti and start printing and distributing flyers. In September 1973, PNC established contacts with another underground leftist group, called the Left School, having first concurred with them in their views on the reasons for the defeat of the Chilean revolution of 1970‚Äì1973 years, and then on the nature of the political regime in the USSR. In May 1974 PNC and Left School agreed to unite their forces, and in September 1974 they merged into one organization under the name of the Neo-Communist Party of the Soviet Union (NCPSU). Despite the agreement to merge, de facto PNC and the Left School were operating separately for some time; therefore, when part of the Moscow group of PNC (including its leaders) was arrested by the KGB in January 1975, the unaffected leaders of the Left School took on the task of saving the organisation through increased secrecy. They successfully kept the organization alive deep underground up until 1977, when arrested NCPSU leaders (from among former PNC members) were released to freedom and began to revive the party. Thus, until January 1977, PNC existed as a separate clandestine group effectively controlled by the Left School.

His slow, soulful, heartfelt tunes have gained wide popularity at Shabbat tables and kumzits gatherings. One of his most successful compositions is \\"Vezakeini\\" (Give Us Merit), derived from the ancient prayer recited at Shabbat candle lighting.  Early life and education  Baruch Levine was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. He attended Eitz Chaim Day School, where his father, Rabbi Michoel Levine, is currently a fifth-grade rebbi (Jewish studies teacher). He also studied at the Toras Moshe and Mir Yeshivas in Jerusalem Levine earned a master's degree in educational leadership, as well as teaching degrees from several institutions. He received his rabbinic ordination from the Jerusalem rabbinical court. After Levine got married, he moved to Waterbury, Connecticut. In 2005, he joined the staff of the Yeshiva Ketana of Waterbury, Connecticut as a fifth-grade rebbi. Levine has four children - Nechama (19), Tova (17), Yisroel (14), and Yonina (8). Music career Levine first began singing at the age of 8 in his school choir. Soon after he began studying keyboard, and performed at school and in summer camp during his youth. He tried out for a spot on the album The Marvelous Middos Machine and was not accepted, but he did sing on a Miriam Israeli album.Besser, Yisroel. \\"The Songs We Sang\\". Mishpacha supplement: \\"10 Years\\". Pesach 5774 (Spring 2004), p. 39. After his marriage, Levine began writing songs which he sold to other performers. One of his demos came to the attention of several music producers, who asked Levine why he wasn't performing his own songs. This led to the production of Levine's first album, Vezakeini, in 2006. The title song, which took him ten minutes to write, has become a relative classic in the Orthodox Jewish world. Like many of Levine's hits, it is a heartfelt tune with a rising crescendo. On his second album, Chasan Hatorah, Levine performed a medley of his compositions that other performers had made famous. For Levine's 2009 album, Touched by a Niggun, Rabbi Yechiel Spero, author of the Touched by a Story series of books, wrote the English lyrics to the songs, which are based on his stories. In 2010 Levine wrote two new songs and performed live in concert with Yaakov Shwekey; the resulting album, Live in Caesarea II ‚Äì 5770, was later released on CD and DVD. Levine was a guest performer at the 12th Siyum HaShas on August 1, 2012, at MetLife Stadium, which was attended by nearly 100,000 Jews. He also performs at charity benefits. On November 27, 2011 he performed together with Shwekey in a concert benefiting Hatzolah in London. He was featured at the HASC 27 \\"A Time for Music\\" concert on January 12, 2013.

Santana was a transportation planner for an engineering firm in the private sector. He was president of the Warrendale Community Organization and served as a legislative assistant to Detroit City Council President Kenneth Cockrel Jr.  Politics  Santana entered a crowded, nine-person field for the Democratic nomination in the 10th District in the Michigan House of Representatives to succeed state incumbent Gabe Leland, who was term-limited. Santana was announced as the winner of election night, taking 35 percent, beating his nearest opponent Stacy Pugh, by just 82 votes. Due to the small margin of his victory, Pugh requested a recount. Santana was later declared the winner by the State's Board of Canvassers, defeating Pugh by 85 votes. In December 2011, Santana made headlines when he lunged at fellow Democratic state Rep. David Nathan during a heated exchange on the House floor. After the altercation, Santana was temporarily removed from the House floor and the rest of the chamber was ordered to stay at their desks, which was termed by some at the state Capitol as an \\"adult time-out.\\" In 2015, Santana was expelled from the Democratic caucus in the Michigan House of Representatives for accepting a committee assignment from Republican House Speaker Kevin Cotter that House Minority Leader Tim Greimel wanted to go to Rep. Brandon Dillon. Santana criticized House Democratic leadership and despite being removed from the caucus, he would continue to work with Democrats and Republicans to best serve the interests of his district.  Later career  In January 2017, Santana was tapped by Governor Rick Snyder to work in the Office of Urban Initiatives. His work focused on assisting members of the Detroit caucus advance legislation as well as corrections reform. Santana transitioned his political career into law enforcement and became a Wayne County Sheriff Deputy in 2018.

It was erected on November 13, 1923, and stands in Section 18 of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States. History=American dead at Arlington and the Women's Legion United States armed forces numbered about 2.8 million during World War I,Caplow, p. 298. although only about 126,000 Americans died in the conflict.Capozzola, p. 209. Many of the dead died in the United States of disease or at ships at sea, and just 79,531 were buried in Europe.Dickon, p. 59. Nonetheless, this was a significant number of burials. France, wishing to return to normal as quickly as possible, did not wish to see mass disinterments. But domestic pressure to \\"bring the boys home\\" led the American government to force the issue. The French relented, and some 20,000 American remains were returned to the United States. After the repatriation of American remains from other European countries, 30,799 Americans remained buried in Europe.Dickon, p. 62-64. Of the repatriated American remains 12.5 percent (or 5,241)Poole, p. 165. were interred at Arlington National Cemetery.Subcommittee on Hospitals, p. 4201. Accessed 2013-11-10. Most of these were buried in the southwest corner of the cemetery in Sections 17, 18, and 19. Design for the Argonne Cross approved the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in 1921. On October 25, 1919, Mary S. Lockwood co-founded the American Women's Legion in Washington, D.C., to assist veterans and their families and to engage in patriotic work.\\"Legion Calls Women.\\" Washington Post. October 26, 1919. The organization swiftly grew into a national one. Lockwood had helped found the Daughters of the American Revolution several decades earlier, and she patterned the Women's Legion on the DAR. Membership in the Legion was open to any women who was a mother, wife, daughter, sister, or official next-of-kin of a veteran who served in World War I.Hendricks, p. 58. Accessed 2013-11-10.

Her two-year term began in 1921, and one of her immediate concerns was the erection of a monument to American war dead. The exact genesis of the memorial is unclear. What is known is that the organization made five separate submissions for a memorial to the United States Commission of Fine Arts, which had review (but not approval) authority over the \\"design and aesthetics\\" of all monuments and memorials on federal land. It is not clear when the commission approved the memorial, except that it did so some time in 1921 prior to November.Commission of Fine Arts, Ninth Report..., p. 70. Accessed 2013-11-10. The Legion didn't yet have approval to erect any memorial.

The $2,500 memorial ($ in dollars) was a plain Latin cross of white marble, to be dedicated to all those who died in the Great War. The chairman of the memorial committee was Miss Abbie B.

Latin cross of white marble from Vermont.\\"After Many Battles.\\" American Stone Trade. 1929, p. 6. The image of an eagle with outspread wings, clutching and appearing in the middle of a wreath, was carved where the arms of the cross met. The cross stands on a rectangular marble base about high. On the front of this base is carved the original inscription:Commission of Fine Arts, Tenth Report..., p. 69. Accessed 2013-11-10.Historian James Mayor wrote in 1988 that an inscription was added to the Argonne Cross after World War II to include the dead of that war as well, but this is not substantiated by the memorial. See: Mayo, p. 112. > IN MEMORY OF OUR MEN IN FRANCE > 1917 - 1918 On the rear of the base is the following inscription: > ERECTED THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF THE > ARGONNE UNIT AMERICAN WOMEN'S LEGION In accordance with a plan designed by the American Women's Legion and approved by the Commission of Fine Arts, the area around the memorial was landscaped. Nineteen pine trees, originally grown in the Forest of Argonne in France, were planted in an arc behind the memorial. Another element of the landscape design was a broad, grassy tapis vert between the headstones, leading to the memorial from Grant Avenue. Photographs from 1923 show that this \\"street of grass\\" was lined with deciduous trees. All the grading and landscaping work was performed by the War Department. Little of the original landscaping survives. All of the original French pines died, and as of 2011 had been replaced with an arc of seven small pines. None of the trees lining the tapis vert survived, either. In the 1980s, the Armenian Apostolic Church of America was given permission to plant a Southern Magnolia about to the east-southeast of the Argonne Cross. This \\"living memorial\\" has a bronze plaque mounted on a granite pedestal at its base.

No lawsuit demanding the Argonne Cross Memorial's removal has been filed against the federal government as of November 2013. However, federal courts have mentioned the memorial in dicta. In January 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit discussed the Argonne Cross as part of its ruling in Jewish War Veterans v. City of San Diego, 629 F.3d 1099, 1108 (9th Cir. 2011). The court noted the existence of Argonne Cross at Arlington National Cemetery and similar crosses at Gettysburg National Military Park. Such crosses, overwhelmed by a nonsectarian environment, are unlikely to run afoul of the Constitution prohibition on establishment of religion. The Ninth Circuit observed:Jewish War Veterans v. City of San Diego, 629 F.3d 1099, 1108 (9th Cir. 2011), 1114, quoting Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005) at 702 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment); DeGirolami, p. 134. :None of these crosses is a prominent or predominant feature of the cemetery, and the overall image and history of this military burial ground are not founded on religion. All three crosses stand among, if not immediately next to, the countless headstones of soldiers buried in Arlington and alongside a large number of other monuments that do not incorporate religious imagery. Headstone after headstone, punctuated by the eternal flame at President Kennedy's grave site, represent the imagery of Arlington. Much the same can be said for the Irish Brigade Monument and the monument to the 142nd Pennsylvania Infantry. Those monuments, which stand at Gettysburg National Military Park, are also surrounded by other statues and monuments‚Äîincluding over 100 other monuments honoring Pennsylvania troops alone‚Äîthat do not feature the cross. The Arlington and Gettysburg crosses are, in other words, non-dominant features of a much larger landscape providing a \\"context of history\\" and memory that overwhelms the sectarian nature of the crosses themselves. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to review the case on June 25, 2012.Mount Soledad Memorial Association v. Trunk et al. and United States v. Trunk et al. 567 U.S. _____ (2012).

This type of group portrait was popular in Dutch Golden Age painting during the 17th century, and in the 18th century. They were intended to be hung in the regentenkamer, the regents' meeting room,\\"Informatiepakket Frans Hals\\", Frans Hals Museum (Dutch) or another prominent location in the institution. The regents of a charitable organization (such as an orphanage, poorhouse, hospital or hofje) or guild were drawn from the regenten, the upper class of Dutch society. It was a prestigious honorary office, so the regents were keen to have themselves depicted in this role. The leading portraitists of the day were commissioned to make regentenstukken, including Rembrandt (whose Syndics of the Drapers' Guild is a subtle treatment of a group round a table), Frans Hals, Ferdinand Bol, and Bartholomeus van der Helst. The commissions proved lucrative, particularly since the regents only served for a few years, to be replaced with a new set of regents who were equally eager to be painted. Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse in Haarlem, Frans Hals, 1664 In some institutions the regentesses were all female, and so the portraits were of all-female groups, or there were mixed-gender regents who were painted separately, as in Hals' two portraits of the Regents and Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse. Occasionally the painting depicted not just the regents but also others, such as the binnenvader or binnenmoeder, who was in charge of the day-to-day operations. For instance, Abraham de Vries in 1633 painted a regentenstuk for the Burgerweeshuis orphanage in Amsterdam showing not only the regents but also the binnenvader leading in a young orphan girl. Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the militia group portrait or schuttersstuk showing officers of a city's schutterij or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the 17th century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Boards of trustees preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces. Scientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter. The cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. In Amsterdam most of these paintings ultimately ended up in possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the Amsterdam Museum.

It was established in 1949 by Pierre Castel, who continues to run the company as a family-owned concern. Castel is the largest French wine producer and owns the biggest French and foreign wine brands distributed in France. Castel Group is also the French leader for table wines and the number four for beers and soft drinks in Africa (after SABMiller and Heineken and Guinness), and ‚Äì after Constellation Brands and Gallo ‚Äì number four for wine worldwide. Castel claims to have a 25 percent share of profits from the African beer market. History Starting with a wine merchant business in Bordeaux, the company steadily expanded in size and scope. Castel grew into other parts of the wine business, first bottling, then acquisition of viniculture lands and brands - Chateau de Goelane, a Bordeaux Superieur, was acquired in 1957 -, later distribution by buying the wine specialty stores of Nicolas (1998) and marketing.Castel Group website Wine Groupe Castel produces many table wines (vin de table). It expanded its wine offering by buying its main competitor, Soci√©t√© des Vins de France, from Pernod Ricard in 1992. The company has a number of well branded wines such as Baron de Lestac, Roche Mazet, Vieux Papes and La Villageoise. It also bought the Malesan and Sidi Brahim wines. In 2008 the company expanded from the south of France to the Loire valley and the Bourgogne. Higher tier wines are sold by the Chateaux and Estate section of Castel (listed below). Since 2008 Groupe Castel has made more efforts to decrease its dependence on the French market and become more visible in English speaking countries, Eastern Europe, and the Eastern Asia, primarily China. As of 2015, Castel owns 1,400 ha of vineyards in France and 1,600 ha in Morocco, Tunisia, and Ethiopia in Africa. It produced 640 million bottles, 59% for the French market. Beer sconce for Castel Beer, the company's core beer product In 1990, it purchased a major competitor in African beer, Brasseries et Glaci√®res Internationales (BGI). In 1994 Castel added La Soci√©t√© de Limonaderies et Brasseries d'Afrique (SOLIBRA) that is focused on soft drinks. In 2003 the company bought Brasseries du Maroc, 2011 Brasseries Star Madagascar, and 2014 Nouvelle Brasserie de Madagascar. Major beer brands are Flag and Castel. The company produces 28 million hectolitres of beer and soft drinks in Africa each year. In 2001, SABMiller acquired 20 percent of Castel's African Beverages operations and Castel acquired 38 percent of SABMiller Africa and SABMiller Botswana. An update of the partnership in 2012 saw the two combine their Nigerian businesses under SABMiller's control with their Angolan businesses set to be handled by Castel.

Zendaya portrays the lead role, Zoey Stevens. Plot Zoey Stevens is an average 16-year-old girl whose mother has just remarried. They move in with her new stepfather and three stepbrothers. Zoey's stepbrother Adam is always in a rush due to being captain of the basketball team; the youngest one, Ben, is always getting dirty; Zach, the middle child, has a habit of making disgusting food creations, and their father, Ted, is the basketball team coach and is always loud. When Zoey arrives at her high school following a disastrous first morning with her new family, Adam quickly abandons her and she makes an unlikely friendship with a kind student named Rachel. Rachel accidentally leads Zoey to the wrong side of the school and she walks in on a science class. She is escorted by Jackson Kale to the correct room and is watched by Taylor Dean. Later, she arrives at dance tryouts, but she learns that her shoes were spoiled by her new brothers. Zoey attempts to dance her own routine during tryouts, further irritating Taylor. She falls due to her shoes and both Zoey and Rachel are banished to the junior varsity team. Zoey goes home to find out the family dog, Humphrey, has destroyed her room. Her phone drops into a bathtub of water, gets thrown out the window, slides down a solar panel and lands in Humphrey's food bowl. Zoey‚Äôs mom puts the phone in a bowl of rice and reassures her that things will work out. The next morning, the phone seems to be working again. Zoey then tries to use a dog app she downloaded previously on Humphrey but to her dismay, it was malfunctioning. However, she noticed that her brothers seem to obey her commands using the app. Zoey uses the app on her brothers and stepfather, making them quieter, more focused, cleaner and healthier. She also uses the app to improve the behaviors of the boys at her school. Later that day, Zoey arrives at dance practice and is elected as the captain. However, her group dances horribly. Zoey uses the app powers on her team and they dance amazingly. She goes to the principal and proposes a dance-off competition between the junior varsity team and varsity team. The principal schedules the dance-off for the night of the upcoming basketball tournament. Everything seems to have been changed for the better, thanks to the app. However, as time passes, Zoey sees that the boys are becoming lifeless after being forced to do things. Zoey tries to reverse her commands with new commands but during dance practice, Taylor mocks the J.V. team's lifeless and robotic dancing. Zoey gets mad and uses the app to mess up the varsity team's dance practice. When Jackson walks in and sees Zoey showing Taylor up, he leaves. Zoey chases after him and (accidentally) uses the app to make him kiss her. Jackson is confused and walks away. Zoey returns to the team and decides to end the practice. In the restroom, Taylor steals the phone while Zoey washes her face. Zoey and Rachel are at Zoey's house, discussing how to reverse the effects of the app, when they learn that Adam has college scouts coming to his basketball game. To make matters worse, they realize that the phone is missing. Meanwhile, Taylor is busy trying to figure out how Zoey controls boys. Just before the basketball game begins, Taylor walks in and controls every male in the room. Zoey steps in (and one by one the rest of her family join her) and persuades Taylor to use it on her instead. Rachel is able to tackle Taylor and the game begins. Zoey figures out how to reverse the app with the word \\"Release\\", smashes her phone and throws it out, much to Taylor's shock. The basketball game begins and Adam's team wins. At the dance-off, the J.V. team is able to win using their own unique dances. At the end of the film, Zoey and Jackson are dating and Zoey and her stepfamily have finally adjusted to living together. In a post-credits scene, two students in detention find the phone and turn it on, showing the app. Cast * Zendaya as Zoey Stevens, the central character of the film. * Chanelle Peloso as Rachel, Zoey's best friend. * Spencer Boldman as Jackson, Zoey's love interest and former boyfriend of Taylor's. * Emilia McCarthy as Taylor, Zoey's rival, school diva. * Adam DiMarco as Adam Thompson, Zoey's oldest stepbrother who plays basketball. * Louriza Tronco as Yuki, Taylor's best friend. * Lucia Walters as Jeannie Stevens, Zoey's mom.

Gandhi. Their mission is to foster peace through development and the empowerment of communities using the philosophy and principles of nonviolent social change. Its missions are carried out through research, education, and technical assistance in underprivileged, conflict, and post-trauma/conflict communities around the globe.Communities Without Boundaries International Home Page Their work can be found in Africa,Honoring Nelson Mandela in Nigeria the Balkans, Turkey,Martin Luther King III with CWBI working with Turkey youth Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia,CWBI working in Nepal and North America. CWBI enters communities to break down social boundaries by creating peaceful bridges. The programs are intended to relieve suffering, increase security, and help people take charge of their lives and their communities. The techniques employed for accomplishing their work are utilized in community building and community development programs. Constructing local, regional, and international partnerships builds on greater communities for implementing peaceful non-violent social change. Their partnerships are integral for developing and implementing several initiatives: From Chaos to Community and Youth Without Boundaries. The success of these initiatives led CWBI to speak at the 50th Anniversary March on Washington. History Martin Luther King, Jr. called for a coalition of organizations to bring on new strategies for overcoming barriers enforced by distressed and disadvantaged communities. After his assassination, organizations emerged with new outlooks on breaking barriers, but many were not considering the power nonviolent social change philosophy could bring to underprivileged and disadvantaged parts of the world. CWBI's emergence came from two previous organizations looking to grasp the same message from Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1990 Coretta Scott King established the Center for Community Development to fill the void of her late husband's vision. Seven years later this initiative was launched nationally as the National Institute for Community Empowerment (NICE) by Johnny J. Mack. Their flagship project was the American Cities Project, targeting neighborhoods in major city urban centers across the United States. The goal of the project was community restoration and revitalizing communities through nonviolent social development. In 2007, NICE was re- articulated and Realizing The Dream (RTD) was born in collaboration with Martin Luther King III. RTD was designed to look at the problems and opportunities of the 21st century in freedom, justice, and equality. Simultaneously the organization works towards eliminating poverty, racism and violent conflict in the United States and throughout the World. RTD was eventually subsumed into the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in 2010. In the fall of 2011, CWBI was founded by Johnny Mack, who held responsibility for the launch of both NICE and RTD. He was joined by Dr. Maneshka Eliatamby. CWBI was established to continue the legacy of NICE/RTD. Lessons and strategies were adopted from these campaigns and pursued. Initiatives CWBI implements its programs with a theory of change seeking to empower individuals and communities. Community development and community building are at the forefront of this change. Through research, education, training, and technical assistance services, CWBI creates sustainable changes and positive approaches. All of their work is developed with the philosophy and methodologies of nonviolence. CWBI has implemented several initiatives all geared to new strategies for approaching community development and community building through nonviolence. These initiatives include From Chaos to Community: An International Initiative, which encompasses their Bridges, Preventing Chaos, and Global Communities Network programs, and Youth Without Boundaries. From Chaos to Community: An International Initiative CWBI works with a network of local partners for engaging conflict and post-conflict communities in peacebuilding. Through interventions targeting communities with research and education From Chaos to Communities accomplishes two things. The first is promoting additional change, tolerance, and mutual respect among disparate identity, cultural, ethnic and religious groups. Secondly it enhances the quality of life for target communities establishing a framework for carrying out sustainable development projects. The goal of this initiative is to redress poverty, building community and fostering peace by engaging targeted communities where youth, clergy, and business leaders work together through community building and community development strategies. The Bridges, Preventing Chaos, and Global Communities Network all fall within this initiative. Previous From Chaos to Community work has been conducted in Bosnia/Herzegovina, India, Kenya, Nepal,Video for Program trip to Nepal Sri Lanka, and the United States. Preventing Chaos This initiative is the violence prevention arm of CWBI. Viewing violence as a strategy employed by groups for positive social change in their community, CWBI bring together elements from philosophical orientation, policies, programs and projects that foster the elimination or mitigation of the elements producing violent responses. CWBI fashions programs for the challenges and opportunities each specific community may be facing. This initiative promotes individuals and groups to take charge of the peace, security, and safety of their communities. Global Communities Network The Global Communities Network is CWBI's partnership with communities within the United States and around the world utilized for carrying out its objectives. They are the principal sponsors and/or collaborators in building and sustaining their community empowerment theory of change. They represent the framework for CWBI to achieve its work in community development and community building. This network comprises civil society networks, nonprofits, foundations, and universities, all promoting nonviolence in tangible ways. The same network is responsible for helping CWBI place interns and YWB members. CWBI's partnership with these organizations is to effect mutually reinforcing capacity among its membership. Access to the network provides organizational development, leadership development, and resource development training and technical assistance. Youth Without Boundaries (YWB) This initiative brings together youth (ages 18‚Äì35) from around the world to travel and experience other cultures, lifestyles, and challenges their peers around the world face. CWBI promotes the role of youth in the world, YWB is therefore designed to put youth at the center of program development in their own countries, where they serve, collaborate, and engage in dialogue with their own communities. Young leadership is important in the future for building peace at global, regional, or local levels through means of nonviolence, civic responsibility, and intercultural collaboration. Selected participants of YWB develop leadership skills consistent with nonviolent philosophy while expanding their vision of the world's realities and possibilities. YWB has members participating in Afghanistan, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Cameroon, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mali, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, South Africa, Sri Lanka, United States, and Zimbabwe. National Action to Realize the Dream In 2013, CWBI joined an alliance of other organizations advocating in issues from labor, civil rights and human rights, education, media, and housing, to march on Washington since Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic 1963 March on Washington. The event was to bring the American peoples attention to a variety of issues in the United States. These include worker's rights, immigration, LGBT equality, and women's rights. CWBI's Johnny Mack, Maneshka Eliatamby, and members of their YWB initiative spoke in front of the Lincoln Memorial, 50 years after Martin Luther King Jr. gave his legendary 'I Have a Dream' speech. Calling on over 20,000 individuals present, Mack and Eliatamby asked to not forget Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision of freedom, justice, and equality.Dr. Maneshka Eliatamby Speaking at 50th Anniversary March on Washington, 2013 Emphasizing the importance of youth, they launched a new challenge to raise the consciousness of the world for quality education, jobs, and peaceful communities.

The lead weaver Mathuradas Burha Aata a disciple of Sri Sir Madhabdev was the first Satradhikar of the great Barpeta satra. Mathuradas Burha Aata along with his 12 assistant weavers wove the Brindavani Bastra. The large drape illustrates the childhood activities of Lord Krishna in Vrindavan. Parts of the original Vrindavani vastra are presently owned by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and Musee Guimet (the Guimet Museum) in Paris. The piece of cloth demonstrates the skillful weaving methods developed during medieval times and such complexity is rarely seen in present-day Assam. History Assamese silk weavers depicted scenes from Bhagavatha, Mahabharatha, mainly of the childhood days of Lord Krishalala on silk clothes under the supervision of Saint, scholar, and poet Srimanta Sankardeva and his disciple Madhvadeva during 16th Century. First woven between 1567 and 1569, it was taken to Bhutan and then later to Tibet, where European merchants brought it back to Europe. Presently, it is owned by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Musee Guimet in Paris. Some reports suggest that the Vrindavani Vastra piece was collected by a reporter of \\"The Times\\" (London) and donated to the museum around 1904. Similar silk drapes are also held by other museums like The Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 2004, a similar piece of silk drape, probably designed by Sankaradeva during 16th Century, was put up for auction by the auction house of Christie's in New York, with a reserve price of $120,000. This type of silken-weaving artwork was produced up to around 1715 in Assam and its neighborhood and exported to places like Tibet. The exhibit owned by British Museum, acquired in 1904 from Tibet, is nine and half meters long and is made up of several pieces of silk drapes depicting Krishna's (or Vishnu's) life. Along with colorful pictorial depictions, it has a portion of a poem written by Srimanta Sankardev woven on it. There were futile efforts by government agencies of India to bring back the silk drape back to India. During 2013, Assam government, India has requested British Museum to exhibit Vrindavani Vastra at London so that art lovers, researchers, and local people with Assamese heritage can admire the piece of art. This textile is now on display until August 2016 in the exhibition 'Krishna in the garden of Assam: the cultural context of an Indian textile' in Room 91 of the British Museum.

He was summoned to Parliament as Lord FitzWarin in right of his wife and is thus deemed to have become 9th Baron FitzWarin.

White served as a Captain in the West Virginia National Guard during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army Judge Advocate General's Corps during World War I. White was a member of the City Council and Board of Affairs of Charleston, West Virginia from 1907 to 1911, and frequently served as the city's mayor pro tempore. He was later appointed a member of the West Virginia Board of Control, where he served as the board's treasurer, secretary, and president at various times. White was a member of the White political family of Virginia and West Virginia and was the son of Hampshire County Clerk of Court and West Virginia Fish Commission President Christian Streit White (1839‚Äì1917) and the grandson of Hampshire County Clerk of Court John Baker White (1794‚Äì1862). White was a nephew of West Virginia Attorney General Robert White (1833‚Äì1915). Early life and education John Baker White was born on August 24, 1868, in Romney, West Virginia. He was the only child of Hampshire County Clerk of Court Christian Streit White (1839‚Äì1917) with his first wife Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Jane Schultze White (1837‚Äì1869) and the eldest of his father's five children. He was a grandson of Hampshire County Clerk of Court John Baker White (1794‚Äì1862), for whom White was named, and a great-grandson of the prominent Virginia judge Robert White (1759‚Äì1831). His uncle Robert White (1833‚Äì1915) served as Attorney General of West Virginia. Through his descent from Robert White and Reverend Christian Streit, White was eligible for and attained membership in the Society of the Cincinnati and Sons of the American Revolution. White received an English education in both the local public schools and at his father's residence in Romney. White further supplemented his education with \\"broadened courses of reading and private study\\". Beginning at the age of 13, White attended school from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. and worked on his family's farm before and after school, and during holidays. At the age of 16, White left his schooling to work on the farm and in his father's county court clerk office while studying privately at home. Early political career White departed his home in Romney for Charleston, West Virginia, where he was entirely dependent upon himself and his own resources. There, White commenced his career in public service in 1886 when he began serving as a messenger in the office of West Virginia Secretary of State Henry S. Walker. He received successive promotions within the Secretary of State's office beginning with clerk, then to stationery clerk, and finally to chief clerk of the office during the latter part of Walker's term in office. White was retained as the chief clerk of the office by Walker's successor, William A. Ohley. White was affiliated with the Secretary of State's office for seven years. He continued to fulfill that position until March 8, 1893, when he was appointed to serve as the private secretary to West Virginia Governor William A. MacCorkle. As a representative of Governor MacCorkle, White traveled across the state to high- profile events, such as the June 1895 strikes at the Crozier Works on Elkhorn Creek in McDowell County, to urge calm and to provide the governor with situational awareness on the strike. White performed as Governor MacCorkle's private secretary for four years until the end of his administration's term in 1897. During the West Virginia general elections of 1892 and 1896, White was recognized for his leadership efforts in support of the campaigns of Democratic candidates.  Law career  While he was employed at the West Virginia State Capitol, White began studying jurisprudence with legal coursebooks. He undertook his study of jurisprudence in the law firm of Chilton, MacCorkle and Chilton in Charleston. White was admitted to the bar in 1897 and afterward established a law practice in Charleston. White's practice began arguing cases in county, state, and federal level courts within West Virginia. On December 19, 1901, the West Virginia Secretary of State office issued a charter authorizing $100,000 in capital stock for the incorporation of Midland Railway, of which White was a corporator with one subscribed share of $100.  Military career  In 1888, White volunteered his service in the West Virginia National Guard, where he entered service with the rank of Private. White was gradually promoted and served in the West Virginia National Guard's 2nd Battalion, 2nd West Virginia Infantry Regiment. White and his regiment were dispatched to the scenes of several strikes throughout West Virginia, where he performed as \\"a special representative\\" of the governor.  Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War  At the onset of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and shortly after his admission to the bar in 1898, White again volunteered for service with the West Virginia National Guard and served throughout the duration of the war. He received his commission from West Virginia Governor George W. Atkinson as Captain in command of Company B of the 1st West Virginia Infantry Regiment in the United States Volunteers. During his service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, White received a promotion to the rank of Major. After a year of serving with his regiment in the war, White received an honorable discharge and vacated the West Virginia National Guard following ten years of service in the guard as a military officer. According to Governor Atkinson in his Bench and Bar of West Virginia (1919), White \\"served faithfully and efficiently until the close of the war\\".  World War I  Major John Baker White (pictured), Judge Advocate General's Corps, photographed c. 1917 during World War I Following the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, White tendered his legal services to the United States Army and served in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. White had previously attempted to enter the service of the United States Army through its various training schools to serve in World War I, but he had been rebuffed each time due to his advanced age of 49. On December 6, 1917, White received \\"special permission\\" from United States President Woodrow Wilson to serve in the Army's Judge Advocate General's Corps with the rank of Major. Upon receiving his commission, White was ordered to London where he served as Assistant Judge Advocate General for United States Armed Forces personnel serving in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. White continued to carry out his duties in London until June 1919 when his base section there was closed and he was transferred to the United States military's general headquarters in France. From France, White deployed to the 3rd Infantry Division occupation headquarters in Koblenz, Germany, along the Rhine where he served as the division's Judge Advocate General. While serving in that position in Koblenz, White was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in April 1919. He continued to serve as the Judge Advocate General for the 3rd Infantry Division until September 1919, and shortly thereafter White was discharged from the United States Army and subsequently transferred to the United States Army Reserve. For his service to the Allies in World War I, White was created a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order by George V on behalf of the British Empire. Following his relief from active military service in Europe, White embarked upon a global journey that consisted of Egypt, Palestine, India, Burma, the Malay Peninsula, Java, China, Japan, and the Philippines. He returned to the United States in June 1920 and soon thereafter resumed his law practice in Charleston.  Later political career  Following his service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, White ran for election as a Democrat and won a seat on the Charleston City Council. White also concurrently fulfilled a four-year term from 1907 to 1911 as a member of the Charleston Board of Affairs during the period in which Charleston was organized under a commission form of government. While serving on the Board of Affairs, he frequently performed duties as the city's mayor pro tempore. Around 1931, White became a member of the West Virginia Board of Control and was serving as the board's treasurer by 1932. White later served as the board's president for two years. In 1939, Governor Homer A. Holt reappointed White to serve another term on the West Virginia Board of Control ending on June 30, 1941.  Marriage  On August 22, 1939, White married Mary Ann Williamson near Malvern in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Williamson was a native of Berkeley County, West Virginia, but resided in Athens, West Virginia, at the time of her marriage. Williamson was a graduate of Shepherd College in Shepherdstown, of Concord College in Athens, and of the University of Kentucky in Lexington. She had been a member of the faculty at Marshall College in Huntington since 1934. Later life and death In his later years, White and his wife resided in St. Petersburg, Florida during the winter season. White died of heart failure on June 2, 1944 at 1 p.m. at the age of 75 at his summer camp near Rupert, Greenbrier County, West Virginia. The medical certification of White's death stated the cause of his heart failure was due to age and overexertion. White's funeral was held in Charleston, and he was interred in the White family burial plot at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. At the time of his death, White was residing at 610¬Ω Capitol Street in Charleston. Affiliations and community service White was a practicing Mason and Knights Templar affiliated with Royal Arch Masonry and the Thirty- second Degree Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. In addition to the Society of the Cincinnati and the Sons of the American Revolution, White was also a member of the Military Order of Foreign Wars, United Spanish War Veterans, American Legion, and the Shriners. White was also an inaugural stockholder and member in the Henry G. Davis Club, named for United States Senator from West Virginia Henry G. Davis, which received its charter on May 31, 1906. The Henry G. Davis Club was founded \\"for the study of political economy and the science of self-government; for the education of the young men of the State of West Virginia in these sciences and the promulgation of such information, literature and statistics as will in the judgment of its directors be best suited for such purposes\\". White also served on the Entertainment Committee for the West Virginia Homecoming Week in Point Pleasant which took place October 7‚Äì10, 1909, to celebrate the Battle of Point Pleasant and the unveiling of the monument to that battle. Legacy In his Bench and Bar of West Virginia (1919), Atkinson remarked of White's service in Charleston city government: \\"His chief aim was to render a service that would advance the interests of the people, without showing favors to any class or classes of the citizens of Charleston.

They expelled the Portuguese from coastal strongholds in Muscat and united the country. They improved agriculture, expanded trade and built up Oman into a major maritime power. Their forces expelled the Portuguese from East Africa north of Mozambique and established long-lasting settlements on Zanzibar, Mombasa and other parts of the coast. The dynasty lost power during a succession struggle that started in 1712 and fell after a prolonged period of civil war. Background Oman has traditionally been divided between the relatively barren and sparsely populated interior and the more populous coastal region. There was often little or no overall government in the interior, and the tribes often fought amongst each other. They shared belief in the Ibadi branch of Islam, distinct from the main Sunni and Shia schools. The coastal region, particularly the northeast coast around Muscat, was more outward looking, with longstanding connections to Mesopotamia and Persia. After the early days of Islam, the interior tribes were led by Imams, who held both spiritual and temporal power. The Yahmad branch of Azd tribes gained power in the 9th century. They established a system where the ulama of the Banu Sama, the largest of the Ibadi tribes of the interior, would select the Imam. The authority of the Imams declined due to power struggles, and in 1154 the Nabhani dynasty came to power as muluk, or kings, while the Imams were reduced to largely symbolic significance. The Imam had little moral authority since the title came to be treated as the property of the dominant tribe at any time. In 1507 the Portuguese captured the coastal city of Muscat, and gradually extended their control along the coast up to Sohar in the north and down to Sur in the southeast. Early rulers Nakhal Fort, a stronghold of the dynasty The Al-Ya'ariba trace their descent from Ya'arab bin Kahtan, whom some date to about 800 BC. The family originated in Yemen and belonged to the Ghafiri faction. Nasir bin Murshid bin Sultan al Ya'Aruba ( 1624-1649) was the first Imam of the Yaruba dynasty, elected in 1624. He moved the capital to Nizwa, the former capital of the Ibadhi Imamate. Nasir bin Murshid was able to unify the tribes with a common goal of expelling the Portuguese. He built up the Omani army and took the main towns as well as the forts of Rustaq and Nakhal. His forces threw the Portuguese out of Julfar (now Ras al-Khaimah) in 1633. In 1643 they took the fort at Sohar. Nasir bin Murshid was succeeded by Sultan bin Saif (r. 1649-1688), his cousin. Sultan bin Saif completed the task of expelling the Portuguese. He captured Sur, Qurayyat and Muscat, expanded the fleet and attacked the Portuguese on the Gujarat coast. Under Sultan bin Seif and his successors Oman developed into a strong maritime power. The Omanis took many of the Portuguese possessions in East Africa. The first attack on Zanzibar, then held by the Portuguese, was in 1652. In 1660 Omani forces attacked Mombasa, forcing the Portuguese to take refuge in Fort Jesus. There was continued fighting between the forces of Portugal and Oman in the East African coast in the years that followed. Bil'arab bin Sultan (r. 1679-1692) succeeded as Imam in 1679 after the death of his father, Sultan bin Saif. This confirmed that the succession was now hereditary, since his father had also succeeded dynastically, while in the Ibadi tradition the Imam was elected. Most of his reign was occupied in a struggle with his brother, Saif bin Sultan, who succeeded Bil'arab bin Sultan when he died at Jabrin in 1692. Height of power Fort Jesus on Mombasa Island Saif bin Sultan ( 1692-1711) invested in improving agriculture. He built aflaj in many parts of the interior to provide water, and planted date palms in the Al Batinah Region to encourage Arabs to move from the interior and settle along the coast. A large falaj was built to provide water for the town of Al Hamra, and it seems that the Ya'ariba supported major investment in settlement and agricultural works such as terracing along the Wadi Bani Awf. Saif bin Sultan built new schools. He made the castle of Rustaq his residence, adding the Burj al Riah wind tower. In 1696 the Omanis again attacked Mombasa, besieging 2,500 people who had taken refuge in Fort Jesus. The Siege of Fort Jesus ended after 33 months when the thirteen survivors of famine and smallpox surrendered to the Omanis, who now became the dominant power on the coast. The expansion of Omani power included the first large-scale settlement of Zanzibar by Omani migrants. The Omanis became known to the Europeans as pirates, and attacked Portuguese bases in western India. The Omanis also moved into the Persian Gulf, taking Bahrain from the Persians and holding it for several years. Saif bin Sultan died on 4 October 1711. He was buried in the castle of Rustaq in a luxurious tomb, later destroyed by a Wahhabi general. At his death he had great wealth, said to include 28 ships, 700 male slaves and one third of Oman's date trees. He was succeeded by his son. Sultan bin Saif II (r. 1711-1718) established his capital at Al-Hazm on the road from Rustaq to the coast. Now just a village, there still are remains of a great fortress that he built around 1710, and which contains his tomb. Civil wars and Persian invasions Rustaq fort, another important stronghold When Sultan bin Saif II died in 1718 a struggle began between rival contenders for the Imamate. One faction supported the young boy Saif bin Sultan II while another supported Muhanna bin Sultan, whom they felt was better qualified to become Imam. In 1719 Muhanna bin Sultan was brought into Rustaq Fort by stealth and proclaimed Imam. He was unpopular, and the next year was deposed and killed by his cousin Ya'arub bin Bal'arab. Ya'arub bin Bal'arab set up Saif bin Sultan II as the Imam and proclaimed himself Custodian. In May 1722 Ya'Arab took the next step and proclaimed himself Imam. This caused an uprising led by Bel'arab bin Nasir, a relative by marriage of the deposed Imam. In 1723 Ya'arub bin Bal'arab was deposed and Bal'arab bin Nasir became the Custodian. A civil war commenced in which Muhammad bin Nasir seized power and was elected Imam in October 1724. His rival, Khalf bin Mubarak, stirred up trouble among the northern tribes. In an engagement at Sohar in 1728 both Khalf bin Mubarak and Muhammad bin Nasir were killed. The garrison of Sohar recognized Saif bin Sultan II as Imam, and he was re-installed at Nizwa. However, some of the inhabitants of Az Zahirah elected Saif's cousin Bal'arab bin Himyar as Imam. After early clashes, the rival Imams remained armed but avoided hostilities for a few years. Belarab controlled most of the interior, and gradually gained the ascendancy on land. Saif was only supported by the Beni Hina and a few allied tribes, but had the navy and the main seaports of Muscat, Burka and Sohar. The fort at Sohar With his power dwindling, Saif bin Sultan II eventually asked for help against his rival from Nader Shah of Persia. A Persian force arrived in March 1737. Saif bin Sultan joined the Persians. They marched to Az Zahirah where they met and routed the forces of Bal'arab bin Himyar. The Persians advanced through the interior, capturing towns, killing, looting and taking slaves. They then reembarked for Persia, taking their loot with them. For a few years after this Saif bin Sultan II was undisputed ruler, but he led a self-indulgent life, which turned the tribes against him. In February 1742 another member of the Yaruba family was proclaimed Imam, Sultan bin Murshid. Sultan bin Murshid was installed at Nakhal and began to hound Saif bin Sultan, who again appealed to the Persians for help and promised to cede Sohar to them. A Persian expedition arrived at Julfar around October 1742. They besieged Sohar and sent forces to Muscat, but were unable to take either place. In 1743 Saif was tricked into letting the Persians take the last forts in Muscat. He died soon after. The Persians took Muscat and again attacked Sohar. The Imam Sultan bin Murshid was mortally wounded under the walls of Sohar in mid-1743. Bal'arab bin Himyar was elected Imam in his place. After enduring nine months of siege in Sohar, the governor Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi negotiated an honorable surrender and was confirmed as governor of Sohar and Barka in return for payment of tribute. In 1744 he was elected Imam. The Persian forces dwindled through desertions. In 1747 Ahmad invited the remaining Persian garrison to a banquet at his fort in Barka, where he massacred them. At first some towns in the interior still adhered to Ya'ariba or other local leaders. On the coast of East Africa, Ahmad bin Said was recognized as Imam only by the governor of Zanzibar. Ahmad bin Said only became undisputed ruler of Oman when Bal'arab bin Himyar died in 1749. The Yaruba family retained some independence. It was not until 1869 that their last stronghold, the fort of al-Hayam in the Al Batinah Region, was taken by Azzan bin Qais.

It is the house most closely associated with his life and career. The house is now operated as the David Adler Music and Arts Center. History David Adler was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1882 to wealthy clothier Isaac David Adler and Therese Hyman Adler. After graduating from Princeton University in 1904, he studied in Europe at Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen and √âcole des Beaux-Arts. After completing his schooling in 1911, he moved to Chicago, Illinois to study under prominent country house architect Howard Van Doren Shaw. After six months, Adler opened his own architectural firm in partnership with Henry Dangler in Orchestra Hall.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/205748.pdf When David Adler married Katherine Keith in 1916, he decided that they should have a new house. The pair had been living in an apartment in Chicago near Adler's main offices. Over the next two years, Adler remodeled an 1864 farmhouse in Libertyville, and the couple moved in in 1918. Libertyville was close to Lake Bluff and Lake Forest, the location of many of his commissions. Although famed for his stately country houses, Adler decided to live in a more humble setting. However, the architectural themes that dominated Adler's country houses were present in the farmhouse remodel. The reformed farmhouse was an eclectic mix of styles, predominately Colonial Revival. Adler enclosed the southwest corner porch and connected to an addition that would become the living room. He added a room to the north that would be used as a dressing room and bath for his wife. Adler also extended the dining room in this direction with a projecting bay. He added a Neoclassical dining porch on the east which opened into the living room. At the same time as the initial remodel, Adler added a one-story servants' cottage. Adler also planned the landscape, designing a formal garden to the rear of the property. Adler constantly experimented with his estate. Over the next thirty years, Adler made over 1300 sketches, documents, and drawings related to the property's design. In 1926, Adler added a five-bay garage with a dogtrot style opening. It serviced a new entrance road that was built to the south which then turned to the west to connect to Milwaukee Avenue. It is topped with a Georgian cupola. In 1934, Adler added a -story extension on the southeast, connecting the servants' quarters to a barn. He expanded the second story of the barn at this time to add more bedrooms and built open porches on the south side of the addition and barn. The most extensive remodeling after 1918 came in 1941. Adler added a -story wing to the farmhouse connecting it to the servants' cottage and elevated the roof of the cottage. This created new rooms for a large sitting room and a new dining room. He also remodeled the bedrooms of the servants' cottage into a pantry and kitchen at this time. Donation and restoration David Adler died of a heart attack in his sleep in September 1949. The estate was passed to his sister, noted interior designer Frances Elkins. Elkins lived in Monterey, California and had little interest in maintaining a second property. Elkins decided to donated the property to the Village of Libertyville on the condition that it be used as a cultural and recreational center. The village was concerned about maintenance costs and initially would not accept the property. A non-profit organization called the David Adler Memorial Park Association formed in 1951 to rehabilitate the property. By 1956, when Elkins died, the organization had done so well to improve the property's value that the village purchased the house. The building was vacant until 1958, when the Libertyville Arts Center was given the building. The property was again renovated in 1971 by the Libertyville Junior Women's Club and in 1980 by the newly formed David Adler Cultural Center. Former Adler client William McCormick Blair helped to raise $250,000 for renovations and then provided an endowment for the property in his will. The David Adler Cultural Center continues to operate the property today. On November 22, 1999, the estate was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Location The David Adler Estate is in Libertyville, Illinois, roughly north of Chicago. The western facade faces Milwaukee Avenue (Illinois Route 21), a major north-south thoroughfare in the northern suburbs. The estate is just south of Buckley Road (Illinois Route 137). The estate is approximately west from Lake Bluff and Lake Forest. The original property purchase was for , which backed up to the Des Plaines River on the east. The house is near the Mrs. Isaac D. Adler House, which was designed by Adler for his mother in 1934.

He was billed as \\"America's Foremost American Jewish Humorist\\". He frequently performed at the Grossinger Hotel in Liberty, New York, in the so-called \\"Borscht Belt\\". Cohen's Yiddish humor was well received by the predominantly Jewish audiences in this area. Cohen was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1911, the son of Julius and Ida (Magidoff). He was raised in Wilmington, Delaware with his sister Rose and his brothers Hym and Phil. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, Cohen became a comedian at the Grossinger Pancoast Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. It was there he met and married\\\\ Lillian Rothman in 1950. The couple had two sons, Jay and David. Cohen developed a unique style of humor in which he delivered jokes and stories with a punch line in Yiddish followed immediately by an English translation. His smooth delivery ensured that audience members who only understood English could still appreciate the joke in its authentic style. Cohen was known for his double-entendre Yiddish-English humor, particularly his translation of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address into Yiddish. His humor was inspired by the lives of the Jews of Eastern Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and Cohen worked to preserve the heritage of Yiddish humor. Cohen was also a gifted raconteur and singer of traditional Yiddish songs, Chassidic melodies, Palestinian songs, and Jewish cantorial selections. Cohen frequently spoke to groups in support of Jewish philanthropic causes. During his career, Cohen raised tens of millions of dollars for the United Jewish Appeal and Israel Bonds. Cohen continued to perform until about a year before his death in 2000 at age 88.

It was found under the foundation stone of the original school buildings from that time. It stated that the school building was erected with the aid of subscriptions for the purpose of a school for the poor white children of the Parish. The school was to be supported by the rent of land and a donation from Francis Williams, Esquire. The endowment was not coming from Francis Williams but from his dead brother, Captain John Williams who in his will had bequeathed 100 acres of land and 300 pounds to be used for the establishment of the school. Francis inherited from John and, instead of giving both the land and the money to the school, he gave only the land. In the will of Francis Williams, he expressly stated that the school was intended for the education of boys primarily. Any funding would be given to the boys' school, with the girls receiving whatever was left over. Boys would be educated in the front building and the girls, housed in a building at the rear between the headmaster's quarters and the church wall. The ratio of boys to girls attending the school was set at 2:1. Reverend Dr. Thomas Harrison Orderson, who was rector of Christ Church Parish Church from 1803 assisted greatly in getting the school started and called some of his Lodge School teachers and asked them to teach at Foundation. Many of Foundation's founding partners were from the Lodge school, including some of Foundation's headmasters. The foundation stone for The Parochial School, as it was called, was laid on July 10, 1809, by The Honorable John Spooner, President of His Majesty's Council in the Island and Commander-in-chief. The land which John had left for the school was rented as directed by the will. Funds received from its rental were given to the school. It was also used to pay for scholarships, which allowed poor people to attend Foundation. The school was destroyed by a hurricane on the 11th of August, 1831, and, along with the church, was relocated to the Fort in Oistins, now known as Christ Church District Hospital. At the time Bishop Coleridge recommended building a separate school for the girls when the boys' school was rebuilt. Provision was therefore made for 12 girls to be admitted to the school. The first stone for the foundation for the new building was laid on June 1, 1832, by his Excellency, Sir James Lyon, Governor and Commander-in-chief of the island. The new building was built using funds given to the government for the construction of schools on the island. The school was opened on September 19, 1832, with 30 boarders, 18 boys and 12 girls, along with 15 daytime-only students, 8 boys and 7 girls. Lunch consisted of six white biscuits and a glass of syrup. Dinner, dependent on the day of the week consisted of soup, fresh fish, meat, and rice. The daily expense of running the school was provided through the close ties it had with the nearby church. Money was collected from rents, sacramental money, sermons and contributions from the vestry. On July 10, 1894, the Legislature passed an Act called \\"The Christ Church Foundation Act\\". The Act gave land around the island and buildings to the school. A committee was appointed to see after it. The Act removed the \\"white\\" color requirement for entrance into the school. As the school continued to grow, more room was required, so in 1898 the committee bought a neighboring house for the girls' school while the boys remained in the current location. The school thus became two separate entities - the Christ Church Boys Foundation School and the Christ Church Girls Foundation School. 1906 saw a momentous change in the school structure. Prior to this date, the school was looked on as a primary or middle school. Teaching only reading, writing and arithmetic along with some religious teaching to children between 7 and 14 years old. After hard work by a man named Samuel Kirton, and despite opposition from the wealthy planters, the school was upgraded to the status of a second grade (Secondary) school. In then taught Languages, Algebra, Geometry, History, and Geography. The age of the students was extended from 14 to 16 and persons wishing to go to Foundation had to pass an entrance examination. In 1928, the school was officially recognized which allowed the school to receive annual grants from the Government. Miss Bradshaw was the head mistress of the girls' school. The school once again out grew its confines and permission was granted by Canon Farrar, Rector of the parish for the school to use the Memorial School building. The Memorial school at that time housed a mixed primary school. It outgrew itself once more and Miss Bradshaw added another large room to the plant. During 1945, Mr. Howard Hayden Director of Education at the time tried to repeal the 1906 act and proposed that the two schools be joined into one. This proposal was opposed by most of the teaching staff, as well as those who had known about the poor treatment of the school by the leaders of the country. The shabby treatment of the girls' school was an especially sore point. However constant pressure by Government caused them to change their minds. Around this time the land which was left to the school by Francis Williams was sold by Government and renamed Parish Land. Samuel Kirton died and left money to pay for persons who have won scholarships to go to Foundation. The first head boy, Frank Broome, was appointed. In 1957, a new building was proposed to be constructed by Miss Gwilliam of the Colonial Office. The cost of $442,100 was collected from the Colonial Office and Welfare departments. The school was opened on January 14, 1957. On February 16, 1960, the school was visited by Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal, who unveiled a plaque commemorating the newly built school. The new building, constructed in 1957, was built on a new foundation. The previous generations of Foundation Boys' School was constructed on the land where Christ Church High School, which had closed, used to be. The land is currently being occupied by a community centre which was constructed by the parish church. The previous generations of the Girls' School were situated in a small building, on the pasture by the current school's west gate. Although occupying the same land and, for the first time, the same building, the school still existed as the Christ Church Foundation Girls' School and the Christ Church Foundation Boys' School. Girls were not allowed on the boys' side and boys were not allowed on the girls' side. The two schools had separate Heads, Deputy Heads and teaching staff. They also had different eating areas and a separate canteen. There were some classes the girls took, (mainly science) which were done over on the boys side, but these were very few. In September, 1978, the amalgamation process was started. New female students who had passed to Foundation were admitted into the boys side and shared classrooms with boys who had similarly passed for Foundation that year. The remainder of the school remained single sex. The following year the batch of mixed first formers were promoted into second form and a new set of mixed students entered first form. During this time no one was admitted to the girls' school and that school composed only students who had gained entry prior to 1978. Thus, at the end of the school year in July 1982, the entire school was mixed and the Foundation Boys' and Girls' Schools no longer existed. The resulting school was called Christ Church Foundation School. After the merger began, the Acting Headmistress of the Girls' school, Mrs. Beryl Sealy, resigned and Mrs. Ruby St. John took over the running of the school until it was finally closed in 1982. The Headmaster of the Boys' school and his Deputy were transferred to the corresponding posts at the amalgamated Foundation School. In 1983 the school began to take in their first batch of mixed-race students including Maryann Redman, Current President of the Barbados Secondary Teachers Union and Alison Hinds and then soon after that other mixed-race students were taken in and then they later became a permanent part of the school's student role both boys and girls alike.

Species have, in cross section, a highly compressed body, a pointed, sometimes highly elongated snout, and tremendous orbits. The living animals would have superficially resembled modern-day trout or small mackerels. As per the family, the trunk shield is short. The genus is distinguished from other members of the family in that the median dorsal plate of the trunk shield is often keeled, with the keel often very high and prominent. Species=B. carinatus The type species. The length of the skull of the holotype is 11.7 cm. Has a broad nuchal plate that is convex posteriorly. The dermal bones are decorated with large, concentrically arranged tubercles. B. bicarinatus There is a postero-median process on the nuchal plate, and a pre-pineal fenestra in this species. The skull of the holotype is 8.5 cm long. B. gracilis The smallest species in this genus: the skull length of the holotype is 6 cm. Differs from B. minor by having a more steeply arched back, smaller facial plates and a lack of a postpineal fenestra. B. grandis One of the largest species in this genus: the skull length of the holotype is around 20 cm. Has a postpineal fenestra, an unusually long (for the genus/family) lateral trunk shield, and comparatively small orbits. The dermal bones are decorated with a pattern of small, evenly spaced tubercles. B. magnus A very large species originally described as a specimen of Anomalichthys. Differs from B. grandis by having a very high, prominent thick keel on the posterior region of the median dorsal plate, and the dermal surface is covered in very large tubercles. B. minor Another small species: the skull length of the holotype is 7.4 cm long. It differs from B. gracilis by having a posterio-median notch on the nuchal plate, the presence of a postpineal fenestra, and larger facial plates.

These 'battles' are performed using material items such as money, mobile phones, clothes, alcohol or foods. In most instances a battle is won by the intentional destruction or wastage of one's own expensive items to demonstrate the lack of concern for such material possessions due to the ability to afford more of the same. A competitor's chances of victory are improved by having items that are more expensive than those of their opponent it can be money or clothes. Some of the Izikhothanes are from Botswana (Fearless Mosha).  Origin  The word \\"Izikhothane\\" is a slang word that originates from the Zulu word \\"Osikhotheni\\". Osikhotheni means people who live in the bushes/bundus, and that is derived from the Zulu word \\"Isikhotha\\" that means \\"bush\\". The singular form of this Zulu word is called \\"usikhotheni\\". This term is township slang for hustlers who live a lavish lifestyle (nice expensive clothes etc.) without having a job or owning a business. You can call them modernised beggars who live by using illegal ways to satisfy their hunger for their lavish lifestyles. Izikhothane originated in the early 2000s in the South African townships of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan previously known as the Eastrand, but mainly started in Katlehong, one of the townships in Eastrand. The act remained largely unnoticed until it gained popularity in 2011 and 2012. A similar trend called uSwenka existed in South Africa in the 1950s where migrant workers and labourers dressed themselves in their finest suits and shoes to compete in contests. The winner of these contests would win money, household necessities or livestock, which they would send back home to their families.  Practices  The Izikhothane are usually from impoverished backgrounds and spend beyond their financial means to purchase high-end designer apparel, prestige branded alcohol, luxury food items, and expensive accessories including jewellery and mobile phones. These items are then destroyed or disposed of in an attempt to create a perception of opulence and thereby gain social status. In Eastern Cape this culture is mostly joined at 11 to 18 years old. The purpose of the culture is to impress and making your clan famous. The members make battles of showing off tags and dancing with other groups to make themselves famous. In P.E. the culture mostly includes music in it. The members end up dissing each other's in terms of challenging. In Eastern Cape a Clan called Kallawa Jewish is the most famous group in the Eastern cape and also Skeem Seh Njabulo, in Jeffreys Bay is Smart Fellaz. Hankey got the elderly clan called Mpolo Trend. The members get money in different ways. Uitenhage got a clan called smart Vegas that is really famous.Eastern cape got the mostly talented clans for example Innocent Squad (also known as Obhuti abamsulwa) is one of the clan with its own recording studio (Omthina fam). As the Producer and the member of the clan meets Young Talents Int, he said \\"I am very glad to be in my clan. My wish is us to be the example of our fellow clans. Grow and glow.Be wise,stop wasting and save for the future\\" said Blessing Brighter mostly known as Jostar. In other ways community don't support this culture but it never stopped. In Eastern Cape, Carvela is mostly worn in terms of showing you afford. They always show themselves in Public places for attention and makes Saturday a big day for them. The ability to afford expensive clothing is fundamental to Izikhothane and one's reputation is determined by this expression. The Izikhothane sometimes demonstrate this by buying two pairs of the same high-end brand of shoe in different colours and then wearing one shoe of each colour to indicate that two pairs of the same expensive shoe can be afforded. Another tactic in battle is to wear expensive clothing in layers and then destroy one layer at a time thereby destroying more clothes than the opponent. Price tags are sometimes retained on the clothing so that competitors can flaunt the cost of their items. Some of the greatest legends are Figo,Lucardo,Thapelo Sello (Sisto Di Boto), King Mosha, Cvk, Don Dada, Fearless Mosha,Mandana,Mavesta,John Bravo.etc.  Battles  The aim of the dance battle is to show more abundance than your opponents as this determines the winner of the battle. There is no tangible reward for winning an Izikhothane battle, just the recognition and affection from the audience that witnesses the battle. Izikhothane battles occur predominantly across South Africa's townships. The act or battle is performed in a public place such as a park or any open space so that large crowds may gather to witness the event. Competitors are predominantly males aged between 12 and 25 years. The popularity of Izikhothane has also started to attract female youth (Material.Mix and Material.Prix). Izikhothane groups compete against each other in inter- or intra-township battles. A group's identity and reputation is upheld by its members' wasteful extravagance. To perform in an Izikhothane battle, a contestant must purchase expensive items such as clothing, shoes, alcohol and exorbitant accessories. Loud, colourful, branded items are a necessity. The more a competitor's gear costs, the more dominant they are able to be in the battle. Once at the battle venue, the contestant calls out an opponent. Thereafter these two competitors dance around, showing off their expensive material items to each other and to the crowd. To win the battle, a contestant may be required to destroy their items such as tearing up cash notes, burning or tearing up their designer branded clothing, pouring out expensive alcohol or custard onto the ground and submerging their mobile phones in water. The champions are decided by the crowd whereby the crowd cheers for the Izikhothane that impressed them the most with their abundance of wealth as depicted by the destruction of their high-value items.

It is a subsidiary of the Brunswick Corporation and a division of the Brunswick Boat Group. Harris Boats pontoons are manufactured in Fort Wayne, Indiana at the Brunswick Boat Group Fort Wayne Operations facility.  History  Brothers Pete and Ernie Harris established their manufacturing business, Harris Manufacturing, in the 1940s and 50's. While looking for a way to expand their business, inspired by an increasing number of individuals building early pontoon boats on 55-gallon barrels and drop tanks from airplanes, the brothers founded Harris FloteBote Marine in 1957. The original Harris FloteBote pontoons were 20-feet in length with steel tubes. Dealers were not receptive to the large boats occupying the extra showroom space, as they were accustomed to typical 16-foot runabouts. In order to gain visibility in the marine industry the Harris brothers would showcase their boats first hand to people around Eastern Indiana and South-eastern Michigan lakes. This tactic successfully built a positive reputation through word-of-mouth. Harris FloteBote revamped the early pontoon boat industry in the 1960s by installing upholstered pontoon seats and furniture on their pontoon boats. Harris Flotebote adopted aluminum tubes around 1968, when welding equipment big enough to accommodate the material became available. In the 1970s Harris Flotebote pontoons were early adopters of sterndrives, and had motor-pods capable of holding engines as powerful as 140 horsepower‚Äîwhich enabled Harris Pontoons to pull water-skiers, an early innovation for pontoon boats. The splash guard added to the front of the pontoons, referred to as a ‚Äúdolphin-nose cone‚Äù were implemented in 1959, this design feature has become standard within the industry. In 2005 Harris-Kayot was purchased by Brunswick Corporation. To meet market demand, Brunswick Fort Wayne Operations, the producer of Harris FloteBote expanded their production facility in June 2013 to a 360,000-square foot manufacturing campus in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Harris FloteBote pontoons will have been produced in the region for over 50 years.  Awards  Recipient of the J.D. Power and Associates award for \\"Highest in Customer Satisfaction with Pontoon Boats.‚Äù Ranking was determined based on responses from consumers who purchased a Harris FloteBote during model year 2005 and 2006. National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) has awarded Harris FloteBote with eleven Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) Awards since it began participating in the program. This indicates positive customer satisfaction surveys of greater than 90% in a given year.

Until Fari√±a became the target of a probe into money laundering in 2013, he was known to the Argentinian public chiefly as the husband of famous model Karina Jelinek, who separated from him after the scandal broke. Because of his high-level involvement in the money manipulations and his marriage to Jelinek, Fari√±a attracted a great deal of media attention and was identified as the ‚Äúman most wanted by the [TV interview] programs.‚Äù The controversy swirling around both his personal and professional life caused La Naci√≥n to state that he was at the center of one of the ‚Äúscandals of the year.‚Äù As of mid 2014, Fari√±a is in prison awaiting trial. Early life and education Fari√±a grew up in a working-class neighborhood in La Plata. He attended the to obtain the degree of accountant, however he dropped out. In June 2013, La Naci√≥n stated that Fari√±a had been ‚Äúa student of accounting until three years ago,‚Äù but in the same publication it stated that he dropped it out. Early in his career, he worked at Dow Agrosciences Argentina. Career Due to personal connections, Fari√±a quickly rose to a pivotal role in the orbit of President N√©stor Kirchner and businessman Lazaro B√°ez, playing various roles in Kirchnerite business activities and financial transactions that would later become the subject of investigation and prosecution. He was part of a circle of high-earning and high-living young men surrounding Kirchner, but was reportedly the only one who was able to ‚Äúmaintain his expensive tastes and expenses‚Äù after Kirchner's death. The article described Fari√±a's connection with powerful leaders as ‚Äúinexplicable‚Äù to ‚Äúmany of those who interacted with him.‚Äù Fari√±a would later be described in La Naci√≥n as having been ‚Äúbold and arrogant‚Äù and ‚Äúunpolished‚Äù by the usual ‚Äúcorporate standards,‚Äù and as having exuded an air of mystery. Even as he ‚Äúmoved millions,‚Äù he ‚Äúcould owe 500 to 1000 pesos to several friends.‚Äù Fari√±a opened a consulting firm named Andr√≥meda, but other businessmen suspected the legality of his operations, noting that Andr√≥meda did not have a landline phone or a corporate e-mail address. The only contact information available for the firm consisted of Fari√±a's own cell phone and his e-mail address at gmail.com. In late 2010, Fari√±a approached businessmen and Kirchner intimate Carlos Molinari, head of the firm Rei Fiduciaria, with the idea of starting a luxury-car rental agency. Molinari approved of the idea and gave money to Fari√±a to purchase a fleet of luxury cars and rent them to millionaires. The company paid for Fari√±a's and Jelinek's wedding. In February 2013 Fari√±a was detained at the airport in Ezeiza with $20,000 he was planning to take to Chile. Marriage to Karina Jelinek Fari√±a gained celebrity as the husband of the famous model Karina Jelinek, whom he met at a party where they were introduced by mutual friends. ‚ÄúWe met in Punta del Este,‚Äù she later recalled. ‚ÄúLeo won me over with his nature‚Ä¶. He treated me like a queen.‚Äù Jelinek was ‚Äústruck by the high standard of living of a man who was just over 24 years old‚Äù and who, despite his humble upbringing, already owned ‚Äúseveral high-end cars‚Äù and ‚Äúan apartment on Avenida Del Libertador‚Äù and enjoyed ‚Äútrips to Miami on private jets.‚Äù She said, however, that his millionaire status did not matter to her; what mattered was that he was ‚Äúsweet.‚Äù Three and a half months later she proposed to him at a bowling alley. Three hundred and fifty guests, including leading politicians, businessmen, models, actors, and journalists, attended their 2011 wedding at the luxurious Palermo Tattersall. Accusations and investigations On April 14, 2013, Periodismo para todos (Journalism for All), an investigative-journalism series on Argentinian TV hosted by Jorge Lanata, presented an episode entitled ‚ÄúThe K money trail‚Äù that included hidden-camera footage on which Fari√±a described in detail the financial maneuvers whereby L√°zaro B√°ez, a businessman close to the Kirchners, managed to transfer about 55 million euros from Argentina to Switzerland. Fari√±a said he had aided in this money-laundering operation, and it was established that the link between B√°ez and Fari√±a was Molinari, who was described as the ‚Äúprotector‚Äù of Fari√±a. Fari√±a claimed in an April 16 interview on the Intrusos program, hosted by Jorge Rial, that he was not involved in money laundering. He called Lanata an ‚Äúanti-government operator‚Äù and accused him of ‚Äúhaughty arrogance.‚Äù Fari√±a said that he had met B√°ez's son Martin through his work as a financial advisor to Austral Construcciones SA, that he had thereafter held meetings with the elder B√°ez and given him advice, and that he had subsequently met N√©stor Kirchner through B√°ez. Fari√±a also maintained that he had known all along that he was being recorded on the Lanata show: ‚ÄúLanata wanted fiction, so I gave him fiction,‚Äù he claimed. In reply to Fari√±a, Lanata said: ‚ÄúI love everything you‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶because it enhances what we will show next Sunday.‚Äù On April 17, 2013, La Naci√≥n stated that Fari√±a had been the subject of an official report, issued a year and a half earlier, on a ‚Äúsuspicious operation.‚Äù On the same date, La Naci√≥n reported that in November 2010, at a meeting with a company involved with a multibillion hydroelectric project, Fari√±a had been presented as a representative of the Development Bank of China, and, to the surprise of his interlocutors, had exhibited knowledge of information that was supposedly known only to the Ministry of Strategic Planning. Also on April 17, La Naci√≥n reported that on March 10, Federal Judge Adolfo Ziulu, in response to a complaint by the tax authorities, had issued a restraint on alienation of properties against Fari√±a in the amount of 314,686.52 pesos (US$38,000). It was additionally reported on April 17 that Fari√±a had again been caught on hidden camera, this time on the Rial program, during which he had been recorded while the program was on a commercial break. Fari√±a said during this break that he did not talk about his business activities to his wife ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs a danger.‚Äù La Naci√≥n reported on April 19, 2013, that federal prosecutor Ramiro Gonzales had asked federal judge Sebastian Casanello to order an investigation into alleged money laundering by Fari√±a and Elaskar. The transactions in question, which involved sums adding up to some 20 million pesos (US$2.4 million), were not those that the two men had admitted on Lanata's show to carrying out on behalf of B√°ez, but other activities that had taken place in 2010 and 2011. Proselac, the Office of Economic Crime and Money Laundering, had received three reports of suspicious transactions from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), headed by Jos√© Sbattella. Much of the FIU's attention was focused on Fari√±a's cash purchases of ‚Äúhigh-end cars.‚Äù The report stated that on the evening of April 18, the offices of Elaskar's firm SGI had been raided, as had Fari√±a's offices in his home in La Plata, and that documents had been seized at both places. It was reported on April 27, 2013, that, according to sources in the aviation sector, Fari√±a had flown several times, always at night, to Punta del Este, Uruguay, ‚Äúin different private planes.‚Äù Moreover, Fari√±a had used airports where the customs controls were less strict. Media reports on April 28 stated that Fari√±a had also traveled frequently on private planes to the U.S., Mexico, Italy, Panama, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina during the previous three years, in some cases returning within hours, a pattern of activity that had raised the suspicions of investigators. According to the manifest of one flight, Fari√±a had been the only passenger, and the cargo had consisted of ‚Äúpersonal effects.‚Äù On April 30, 2013, B√°ez filed legal actions with federal judge Sebastian Casanello against both Fari√±a and Elaskar for having defamed him on Lanata's program. On May 30, 2013, it was reported that Casanello had ordered Elaskar and Fari√±a to testify in court about money laundering on their part, evidence of which had been collected by the FIU on the orders of prosecutor Carlos Gonella. On June 3, Fari√±a failed to present himself in court for a scheduled inquest, of which his lawyer Ivan Mendoza had requested a postponement. In early June, Maximiliano Acosta testified in court that he, Fari√±a, and Maximiliano Goff, during a January 2011 stay in Uruguay, had been offered the right to purchase a 150-hectare plot of Uruguayan beachfront property, called The Entrevero, which Acosta had ended up buying as a front man for Daniel Perez Gadin, an associate of B√°ez. Also involved in the transaction were Carlos Molinari and his son Matthias, who planned to build a real-estate development on the site. Although promised a sizable commission, Acosta received nothing, and later received death threats, presumably from persons close to B√°ez, as a result of which he moved to Uruguay. On June 5, 2013, Acosta requested judicial protection for himself and his family. On June 6, Casanello froze Fari√±a's and Elaskar's assets and ordered them to appear in court for questioning on June 10. Both men presented themselves in court on that date and spent several hours answering the judge's questions. Fari√±a repeated his claim that he had known Lanata was doing a hidden-camera program and that everything he had said on the program was ‚Äúfiction.‚Äù Fari√±a admitted having bought land in Mendoza at B√°ez's request, but denied having transported bags of money for B√°ez and said that his numerous flights to Uruguay had been ‚Äúsightseeing trips.‚Äù Both he and Elaskar denied that B√°ez had run a money- laundering operation, and both accused Lanata of promulgating lies in an effort to overturn the government. Testifying again before Casanello in June 2013, Fari√±a said that he was an auditor for Austral Construcciones, a firm owned by B√°ez, and that he worked under Molinari, who paid him a monthly salary of 70,000 pesos (US$8,460). It was reported on June 12, 2013, however, that Fari√±a's official earnings could not account for the amount of money he had spent in recent years on various high-ticket items, such as his apartment in Buenos Aires and a number of cars, including two Ferraris, an Audi, and a BMW. It was also reported that Fari√±a had told Casanello that his flights to Mexico and Uruguay had been paid for by Molinari. In addition, Fari√±a said that Molinari's car-leasing firm had paid him several hundred thousand pesos in commissions. He outlined various other business activities in which he had been involved with Lazaro and Martin B√°ez. A June 16 report indicated that details of Fari√±a's financial relationship to SGI had been uncovered. On June 17, a complaint was filed against him for tax evasion. In early July 2013, a court rejected B√°ez's suit against Fari√±a for allegedly defaming him on Lanata's program. Appearing in early July on a TV interview show, Fari√±a repeated his claim that he had not been telling the truth on Lanata's program. He said that his standard of living had ‚Äúnot changed since I met Karina,‚Äù that he had never committed a wrongful act, and that he was ‚Äúproud‚Äù to have known and worked with B√°ez. He asked Lanata for the ‚Äúright to reply,‚Äù charging the journalist with manipulating his on-camera testimony. ‚ÄúI have been mistaken in many things,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I'm not a criminal.‚Äù In September 2013, Casanello ordered a raid on Molinari's firm Rei Fiduciaria, in order to determine the legitimacy of Fari√±a's claim that his lavish lifestyle could be accounted for by his income from Rei Fudiciaria. Separation and divorce Fari√±a's marriage to Jelinek was the frequent subject of headlines in the Argentinian press in the months following Lanata's program. On April 18, 2013, La Naci√≥n reported that Jelinek's life had ‚Äúbecome an inferno‚Äù since the program aired. ‚ÄúI love him, he's my husband,‚Äù she told reporters, but added that she and Fari√±a were ‚Äúnow at an impasse.‚Äù An April 23 article reported that Fari√±a and Jelinek were still living together, despite everything. It was reported on May 22, 2013, that Jelinek, in the next few hours, would be flying to Miami ‚Äúto get away from journalistic harassment, rethink her relationship with Leo Fari√±a, and make some decisions relating to her future career.‚Äù Fari√±a was reportedly ‚Äúvery angry‚Äù and felt abandoned in a moment of crisis. According to a June 18 report, Jelinek had said that she still loved Fari√±a but that their marriage was in a ‚Äústalemate.‚Äù Asked in an early July TV interview if she knew about the investigation into the K money trail, Jelinek said that she knew ‚Äúnothing about politics,‚Äù but asserted that she believed in her husband and denied having separated from him. Fari√±a showed on camera some of his 19 tattoos, including one that read: ‚ÄúOnly God can judge me.‚Äù On August 28, 2013, Jelinek ended the marriage, reportedly motivated less by his legal troubles than by his extramarital indiscretions during travels abroad. ‚ÄúLately he changed a lot,‚Äù she explained, ‚Äúand I was very neglected as a woman. He didn‚Äôt even want me to accompany him on his trips; there was always some excuse.‚Äù In a September 2 interview, she called Fari√±a an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù (boludo) and affirmed that they were now separated. Although she had supported him over the money- laundering charges, recent revelations about his infidelities had caused her to distrust him fully. In reaction, Fari√±a gave a phone interview to Jorge Rial on Intrusos in which he accused Jelinek of breaking a ‚Äúpact‚Äù she had with him and trying to commit extortion against him. He made lewd remarks publicly about Jelinek, which she completely dismissed. Jelinek filed for divorce and in September went to court to ask that his estate be preserved intact in expectation of liens that she expected to file. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose any more,‚Äù she said. She also asked for police protection, telling prosecutor Guillermo Marijuan that she felt threatened because she claimed Fari√±a was prone to violence, a charge Fari√±a denied. The couple's first settlement hearing was held on September 24. La Naci√≥n noted that although Fari√±a's public identity had been that of a millionaire, he had in fact ‚Äúnothing in his name.‚Äù The couple could not come to any agreement at the first hearing, after which Jelinek told the press that Fari√±a was a ‚Äúpathological liar‚Äù and ‚Äúpsychopath.‚Äù A second divorce hearing was held on September 30. In late September came reports that Fari√±a was involved with Uruguayan model Monica Farro and that model Magali Mora was expecting his child. On December 1, Fari√±a tweeted a picture of him and his new fianc√©e, Macarena Perez, writing that they were ‚Äúso happy.‚Äù The divorce from Jelinek was finalized in February 2014. Vehicles On November 27, 2013, Fari√±a was involved in a near- accident in the Palermo neighborhood of Buenos Aires and was taken into police custody after the police ascertained that the BMW he was driving was not the same one for which he presented ownership documents. Fari√±a's lawyer Rodolfo Baqu√© told reporters that the vehicle belonged to a friend. The friend turned out to be Juan Ignacio Suris, who in December was charged with being the head of a drug-smuggling gang and arrested in January 2014. In January 2014, shortly after marrying Macarena Perez, Fari√±a was again detained by the police for driving a vehicle, this time an Audi, for which he did not have the proper papers. Shortly thereafter, authorities ascertained that Fari√±a had not paid taxes on the car and that his summer home in Pinamar, in another apparent tax dodge, was officially listed as vacant land. The car was seized so that authorities could auction it to cover a portion of Fari√±a's tax debt. In March 2014, Federico Holjevac, son of a Croatian businessman who was under investigation for fraud, claimed ownership of an impounded Ferrari that he said he had bought from Fari√±a and that, the FIU believed, had perhaps been transferred as part of a money-laundering operation. La Naci√≥n reported on March 10, 2014, that the FIU had submitted reports to Casanello outlining Fari√±a's possession of luxury items registered in other people's names in order to avoid taxes. The FIU was also looking into the question of whether business activities by Suris were connected to money laundering by Fari√±a. Arrest and pre-trial detention On March 25, by order of Judge Manuel Blanco of La Plata, Fari√±a was arrested for tax evasion in a hotel in the Palermo section of Buenos Aires. La Naci√≥n reported on March 30 that the Fari√±a scandal was ‚Äúexpanding and branching off.‚Äù On April 9, the newspaper reported an October 22, 2013 phone call in which Fari√±a proposed transferring $90 million from a bank in Portugal to Central America via Liechtenstein and other countries. On April 11, 2014 Blanco indicted Fari√±a on charges of tax evasion and aggravated fraudulent fiscal insolvency. Blanco stated that the court had gathered ample evidence to support the charges. The ‚Äúcourtroom walls,‚Äù stated La Naci√≥n in April 2014, were ‚Äúclosing in on Fari√±a.‚Äù In May, Casanello indicted Fari√±a and Elaskar for money laundering related to B√°ez's operations. Fari√±a was accused of laundering 35 million pesos (US$4.2 million). Casanello seized Fari√±a's residence at Avenida del Libertador as well as several cars, property in Mendoza, and shares in three firms. In a May 2014 police operation against a drug gang, a BMW belonging to Fari√±a was confiscated along with large amounts of marijuana and cocaine. Also in May, Blanco refused for the second time to release Fari√±a from jail; in June, the Federal Court of Appeals of La Plata, consisting of judges Carlos Nogueira, Antonio Pacilio, and Carlos Vallef√≠n gave its approval to Fari√±a's continued pre-trial detention.

He seized control of Aleppo in 975 and governed it until 977, when the rightful Hamdanid ruler, Sa'd al-Dawla, regained it. Given the governorship of Homs, in 983 he went over to the Fatimids and launched an attack on Aleppo, which was defeated through the intervention of Byzantine troops. Bakjur then became governor of Damascus for the Fatimids until 988. He made a last attempt to capture Aleppo in 991, which again was defeated thanks to Byzantine assistance. Bakjur was captured by Sa'd al-Dawla and executed.  Life  Bakjur was a Circassian military slave (mamluk or ghulam), originally recruited by the Hamdanids. By 969, he had risen to be the deputy of Qarquya, the powerful chamberlain (hajib) of the emir Sayf al-Dawla. After the latter's death in 967 Qarquya took over rule of Aleppo, effectively dispossessing Sayf al-Dawla's son Sa'd al-Dawla, who after long wanderings managed to find refuge in Homs. Syria (Bilad al-Sham) and its provinces in the 9th century In 975, Bakjur deposed and imprisoned Qarquya and seized Aleppo for himself. This encouraged Sa'd al- Dawla to attempt to recover his father's capital. Aided by some of his father's ghulams, and, crucially, the powerful Banu Kilab tribe living around Aleppo, Sa'd al-Dawla besieged Aleppo and captured it. Qarquya was set free and again entrusted with the affairs of state until his death a few years later, while Bakjur was given the governorship of Homs in compensation. Sa'd al-Dawla had recovered control of his emirate, but his position was precarious: Aleppo was situated between two great powers, the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate, who vied for control over the Hamdanid emirate, and northern Syria with it. Since 969, Aleppo had been tributary to the Byzantines, a fact Sa'd al-Dawla resented. On the other hand, he was dependent on Byzantine aid to prevent the Fatimid caliph, al-Aziz, from annexing the emirate outright. As a result, his policy vacillated between the two powers. In 983, Bakjur quarrelled with Sa'd al-Dawla and went over to the Fatimids. The Fatimids supplied him with an army, with which he attacked Aleppo in September. Sa'd al-Dawla was forced to appeal to the Byzantine emperor Basil II for help, and the Fatimid siege was raised by an army under Bardas Phokas the Younger. The Byzantines then proceeded to sack Homs in October. The city was returned to Hamdanid control, while Bakjur fled to Fatimid territory. Bakjur now appealed to al-Aziz, and requested the governorship of Damascus. This request produced a rift between the Caliph al-Aziz, who favoured expansion in Syria and saw in Bakjur a tool for capturing Aleppo, and his long-serving vizier, Yaqub ibn Killis, who was opposed to this policy and moreover wished to maintain the incumbent governor, Baltakin, a prot√©g√© of his. Powerful interests within the city, especially the Jews under Manasseh ibn al-Qazzaz, and the Turkish military establishment also opposed Bakjur's appointment due to his relation with the local Arab tribal leaders, particularly the Banu Tayy under Mufarrij ibn Daghfal. In the end, al-Aziz overrode any objections and ordered the city handed over to Bakjur (December 983). Bakjur's tenure in Damascus was troubled due to the opposition he faced, and the brutal measures with which he repressed it made him unpopular. Already soon after his assumption of the governorship he executed one of Manasseh ibn al-Qazzaz's Jewish supporters, while in 987 a plot, sponsored by Ibn Killis, to unseat him resulted in a wholesale slaughter of Bakjur's opponents in the city. Finally, in spring 988 Ibn Killis persuaded al-Aziz to depose Bakjur, and dispatched an army under Munis against Damascus. Bakjur and his Arab ally Mufarrij skirmished with Munis' Fatimid troops and their Arab tribal allies for about two months, before Munis scored a major success at a battle in Dariya, south-east of Damascus. Disheartened, Bakjur obtained a promise of pardon and free passage, and left for Raqqa on the Euphrates on 29 October. He was replaced by another of the prot√©g√©s of Ibn Killis, the ghulam Ya'qub al- Siqlabi. From Raqqa, he continued to plot against Sa'd al-Dawla, hoping to regain control of Aleppo. Sa'd al-Dawla, again with Byzantine assistance, was able to defeat and capture Bakjur at Na'ura east of Aleppo in April 991, and later had him executed.

Every local authority in England was obliged to secure the provision of health checks to be offered to eligible persons (aged from 40 to 74 years) in its area.  Creation and criticism  In January 2008, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that preventive healthcare was planned to be offered throughout England to \\"monitor for heart disease, strokes, diabetes and kidney disease‚Äìconditions which affect the lives of 6.2 million people, cause 200,000 deaths each year and account for a fifth of all hospital admissions.\\" Some, such as the Glasgow GP Margaret McCartney, have criticised the programme of health checks as being without evidence of effectiveness. However, the head of health and wellbeing at Public Health England Kevin Fenton defended the programme, claiming it was evidence-based. A study published in 2014 in the British Journal of General Practice found no significant differences in the change to the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease or atrial fibrillation in general practices providing NHS Health Checks compared with control practices.  Costs and take-up  Peter Walsh, deputy director of the Strategy Group at NHS England admitted that take-up of the checks was poor in January 2016, after a study showed that 20% of those eligible aged 60‚Äì74 attended and 9.0% of those between 40‚Äì59. In May 2016 researchers from Imperial College London concluded that the checkup reduced the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease by 0.21%, equivalent to one stroke or heart attack avoided every year for 4,762 people who attend. The programme cost ¬£165 million a year. A retrospective observational study by the Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London found that take up in an ethnically diverse and socially deprived area of East London had increased from 7.3% of eligible patients in 2009 to 85.0% in 2013‚Äì2014. New diagnoses of diabetes were 30% more likely in attendees than nonattendees, hypertension 50%, and Chronic Kidney Disease 80%. Only 8.1% of adults aged 40‚Äî74 years in England had an NHS health check in 2018/2019, although 17.6% were offered one. In August 2019 Matt Hancock announced that the checks would be more tailored to individuals‚Äô risks.  Elsewhere in the UK  A similar provision under the \\"Life Begins at 40\\" programme was announced by the Public Health minister for Scotland Shona Robison in 2011. However, the health checks have yet to be implemented in Scotland, with some GPs arguing that there is no evidence for its effectiveness and challenging that it is a waste of money and time.

Merit Network staffs and operates the Michigan Cyber Range in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Range's infrastructure contains virtual servers placed on Merit's fiber-optic network. The Michigan Cyber Range currently has four physical locations in Michigan, on the campuses of Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan, Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Northern Michigan University in Marquette, and the 110th Attack Wing facility in Battle Creek. Expansion plans could involve as many as 10 sites.  History  The Michigan Cyber Range was a foundational piece of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder's cyber initiative, which was launched in October 2011 to improve cybersecurity efforts to protect families, communities, businesses and government. Merit Network's CEO and President Don Welch who, while a professor helped create the United States Military Academy's cybersecurity program, worked with David Behen of the State and Brigadier General Mike Stone from the Michigan National Guard to create the vision for the Cyber Range and secure its start-up funding. Throughout 2012, public and private organizations pledged funds and the Michigan Cyber Range was created and staffed. William J. \\"Joe\\" Adams joined Merit Network in June 2012 as executive director of research and the Michigan Cyber Range. Adams, a career Signal Corps officer in the U.S. Army, was formerly CIO of the National Defense University. Adams has also served as a professor and research scientist at West Point and network engineer for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. Shortly after his hiring, Adams assembled a staff to create and maintain the Michigan Cyber Range's cybersecurity training environment, which is called Alphaville. Alphaville is a virtual environment that simulates the computer systems of a town hall, library, small company, police station, and power company. Organizations and companies can practice the detection and mitigation of cybersecurity threats using the Alphaville environment. On November 9, 2012, Michigan Governor Snyder participated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for Michigan Cyber Range. Michigan Cyber Range partners include Merit Network, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Energy, National Institute of Standards and Technology, DTE Energy, Consumers Energy, Plante and Moran PLLC, Juniper Networks, Eastern Michigan University, Michigan State Police, Michigan's Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, Michigan Economic Development Corporation, and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget. In January 2013, the Michigan Cyber Range began a collaboration arrangement with Mile2, a developer and provider of vendor neutral professional certifications for the cybersecurity industry. Mile2 provides course materials, instructors and certification exams to the Michigan Cyber Range, and the Range offers a full curriculum of training courses in many cybersecurity disciplines. Mile2 is recognized by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) as an Information Assurance (IA) Courseware Institution, and the company is NSA CNSS-accredited as well as NIST and NICCS-mapped. Organizations and businesses use the Michigan Cyber Range to conduct cybersecurity exercises and simulate various kinds of cyberattacks. On July 24, 2013, members of the West Michigan Cyber Security Consortium (WMCSC) participated in a red team‚Äìblue team exercise, where WMCSC team members defended the IT resources of a virtual town from cyber attacks initiated by Michigan Cyber Range staff. The Michigan Cyber Range, members of the West Michigan Cyber Security Consortium (WMCSC) and members of the Michigan Cyber Civilian Corps (MiC3) joined forces again for a second red vs. blue team exercise on the campus of Davenport University on July 23, 2014. In September 2013, Merit Network introduced a new cybersecurity service, called Merit Secure Sandbox, which uses the infrastructure of the Michigan Cyber Range. Organizations can use the service for cybersecurity exercises, educational purposes, and software testing. On March 25, 2014, the Michigan Cyber Range opened the first cybersecurity hub of its kind at a U.S. National Guard base, dedicating the facility located at the 110th Attack Wing in Battle Creek, Michigan. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony. During the event, teams in Battle Creek participated in cybersecurity exercises with similar teams at the United States Military Academy at West Point and at the California National Guard. On October 15, 2014, Consumers Energy and DTE Energy conducted an incident response exercise using the Michigan Cyber Range. Representatives from the two power companies and the Michigan State Police worked closely with Cyber Range staff to create the exercise, called \\"Power Phoenix\\", which required participants to diagnose and mitigate a malware-compromised computer network and SCADA environment.\\"Michigan Cyber Range to Debut SCADA Security Training Component,\\" by Nikolay Tsvetkov, Mile2 , retrieved April 27, 2015. In early 2015, Wayne County Community College District (WCCCD), in conjunction with the Michigan Cyber Range and Mile2, hosted a groundbreaking veteran's retraining program. The 13-week program prepared a group of military veterans for a career in cybersecurity. 17 students participated in the retraining program. The veterans were selected based on their experience and aptitude, in conjunction with Wayne County‚Äôs veterans affairs office.\\"New Cybersecurity Program for Veterans\\", press release, Merit Network, February 12, 2015. During 2016, the Michigan Cyber Range added new publicly-accessible hubs of the in Southeast Michigan. Each location provides certification courses, cybersecurity training exercises and product hardening/testing through a direct connection to the Michigan Cyber Range. Cyber Range Hubs opened inside the Velocity Center at Macomb-Oakland University\\"Michigan Cyber Range opens in Sterling Heights\\", Sean Delaney, Macomb Daily, March 18, 2016. in Sterling Heights on March 18th and at Pinckney Community High School\\"Pinckney CTI Grand Opening\\", news article, Pinckney Community Schools, December 7, 2016. on December 7th. During the fall of 2016, Merit Network and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder launched the Governor's High School Cyber Challenge, a competition for high school students to test their skills in computer science, information technology and cybersecurity. The final round of the challenge happened at the North American International Cyber Summit, hosted by Governor Snyder on October 17, 2016. The three-person team from Clinton High School was crowned champions of the competition after defeating the 28 other teams in the inaugural event. The Michigan Cyber Range provided the challenges and infrastructure for the annual cyber competition.\\"Michigan aims to spur economy through student cyber competition\\", Darlene Aderoju, State Scoop, August 12, 2016. Michigan Cyber Range has twice been named the North American Authorized Training Center (ATC) of the year by Mile2.\\"Merit Named Mile2 Training Center of the Year,\\" by Brian Warkoczeski, Merit, March 26, 2015, retrieved April 27, 2015. In 2017, the Michigan Cyber Range doubled the participation in the Governor‚Äôs High School Cyber Challenge from 292 high school students to 584. This included successful elicitation of participation from Native American tribal areas in Michigan. Another milestone was the addition of Cyber Range hubs in Florida and Georgia. Continuing their commitment since 2015, the Cyber Range provides exercises, support and infrastructure to the US Cyber Challenge, a national cyber competition sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security. Other milestones include the creation of virtual environments to facilitate cybersecurity involvement in kinetic training exercises, creation of an International Cyber Exercise (ICE) to promote collaboration and partnership between states‚Äô National Guard units and the countries participating in the State Partnership Program (SPP), and the successful launch of the Regional Cybersecurity Education Collaboration in partnership with the State of Michigan and Cisco. The ICE event in 2017 was run at the NAICS ‚Äì 12 states and 10 countries participated. See also *  References See also *  External links  *Michigan Cyber Range *Merit Network, Inc.

It relies on viral or non-viral vectors to deliver DNA or RNA to target brain areas where seizures arise, in order to prevent the development of epilepsy or to reduce the frequency and/or severity of seizures. Gene therapy has delivered promising results in early stage clinical trials for other neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, raising the hope that it will become a treatment for intractable epilepsy.  Overview  Epilepsy refers to a group of chronic neurological disorders that are characterized by seizures, affecting over 50 million people, or 0.4‚Äì1% of the global population. There is a basic understanding of the pathophysiology of epilepsy, especially of forms characterized by the onset of seizures from a specific area of the brain (partial-onset epilepsy). Although most patients respond to medication, approximately 20%‚Äì30% do not improve with or fail to tolerate antiepileptic drugs. For such patients, surgery to remove the epileptogenic zone can be offered in a small minority, but is not feasible if the seizures arise from brain areas that are essential for language, vision, movement or other functions. As a result, many people with epilepsy are left without any treatment options to consider, and thus there is a strong need for the development of innovative methods for treating epilepsy. Through the use of viral vector gene transfer, with the purpose of delivering DNA or RNA to the epileptogenic zone, several neuropeptides, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors have shown potential as transgenes for epilepsy treatment. Among vectors are adenovirus and adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV), which have the properties of high and efficient transduction, ease of production in high volumes, a wide range of hosts, and extended gene expression. Lentiviral vectors have also shown promise. Clinical research Among challenges to clinical translation of gene therapy are possible immune responses to the viral vectors and transgenes and the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, which can be detrimental to patient safety. Scaling up from the volume needed for animal trials to that needed for effective human transfection is an area of difficulty, although it has been overcome in other diseases. With its size of less than 20 nm, AAV in part addresses these problems, allowing for its passage through the extracellular space, leading to widespread transfection. Although lentivectors can integrate in the genome of the host this may not represent a risk for treatment of neurological diseases because adult neurons do not divide and so are less prone to insertional mutagenesis Viral approaches in preclinical development In finding a method for treating epilepsy, the pathophysiology of epilepsy is considered. As the seizures that characterize epilepsy typically result from excessive and synchronous discharges of excitatory neurons, the logical goal for gene therapy treatment is to reduce excitation or enhance inhibition. Out of the viral approaches, neuropeptide transgenes being researched are somatostatin, galanin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY). However, adenosine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABA receptors are gaining more momentum as well. Other transgenes being studied are potassium channels and tools for on-demand suppression of excitability (optogenetics and chemogenetics). Adenosine  Adenosine is an inhibitory nucleoside that doubles up as a neuromodulator, aiding in the modulation of brain function. It has anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to neuroprotective and anti-epileptic properties. The most prevalent theory is that upon brain injury there is an increased expression of the adenosine kinase (ADK). The increase in adenosine kinase results in an increased metabolic rate for adenosine nucleosides. Due to the decrease in these nucleosides that possess anti-epileptic properties and the overexpression of the ADK, seizures are triggered, potentially resulting in the development of epileptogenesis. Studies have shown that ADK overexpression results from astrogliosis following a brain injury, which can lead to the development of epileptogenesis. While ADK overexpression leads to increased susceptibility to seizures, the effects can be counteracted and moderated by adenosine. Based on the properties afforded by adenosine in preventing seizures, in addition to its FDA approval in the treatment of other ailments such as tachycardia and chronic pain, adenosine is an ideal target for the development of anti- epileptic gene therapies. Galanin Galanin, found primarily within the central nervous system (limbic system, piriform cortex, and amygdala), plays a role in the reduction of long term potentiation (LTP), regulating consumption habits, as well as inhibiting seizure activity. Introduced back in the 1990s by Mazarati et al., galanin has been shown to have neuroprotective and inhibitory properties. Through the use of mice that are deficient in GalR1 receptors, a picrotoxin-kindled model was utilized to show that galanin plays a role in modulating and preventing hilar cell loss as well as decreasing the duration of induced seizures. Conducted studies confirm these findings of preventing hilar hair cell loss, decreasing the number and duration of induced seizures, increasing the stimulation threshold required to induce seizures, and suppressing the release of glutamate that would increase susceptibility to seizure activity. Galanin expression can be utilized to significantly moderate and reduce seizure activity and limit seizure cell death. Neuropeptide Y  Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is found in the autonomic nervous system, helps modulate the hypothalamus, and therefore, consumption habits. Experiments have been conducted to determine the effect of NPY on animal models before and after induced seizures. To evaluate the effect prior to seizures, one study inserted vectors 8 weeks prior to kindling, showing an increase in seizure threshold. In order to evaluate the effects after epileptogenesis was present, the vectors were injected into the hippocampus of rats after seizures were induced. This resulted in a reduction of seizure activity. These studies established that NPY increased the seizure threshold in rats, arrested disease progression, and reduced seizure duration. After examining the effects of NPY on behavioral and physiological responses, it was discovered that it had no effect on LTP, learning, or memory. A protocol for NPY gene transfer is being reviewed by the FDA.  Somatostatin Somatostatin is a neuropeptide and neuromodulator that plays a role in the regulation of hormones as well as aids in sleep and motor activity. It is primarily found in interneurons that modulates the firing rates of pyramidal cells primarily at a local level. They feed-forward inhibit pyramidal cells. In a series of studies where somatostatin was expressed in a rodent kindling model, it was concluded that somatostatin resulted in a decreased average duration for seizures, increasing its potential as an anti-seizure drug. The theory in utilizing somatostatin is that if pyramidal cells are eliminated, then the feed forward, otherwise known as inhibition, is lost. Somatostatin containing interneurons carry the neurotransmitter GABA, which primarily hyperpolarizes the cells, which is where the feed forward theory is derived from. The hope of gene therapy is that by overexpressing somatostatin in specific cells, and increasing the GABAergic tone, it is possible to restore balance between inhibition and excitation.  Potassium channels Kv1.1 is a voltage-gated potassium channel encoded by the KCNA1 gene. It is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral nerves, and plays a role in controlling the excitability of neurons and the amount of neurotransmitter released from axon terminals. Successful gene therapy using lentiviral delivery of KCNA1 has been reported in a rodent model of focal motor cortex epilepsy. The treatment was well tolerated, with no detectable effect on sensorimotor coordination. Gene therapy with a modified potassium channel delivered using either a non- integrating lentivector that avoids the risk of insertional mutagenesis or an AAV has also been shown to be effective in other models of epilepsy .  Optogenetics A potential obstacle to clinical translation of gene therapy is that viral vector-mediated manipulation of the genetic make-up of neurons is irreversible. An alternative approach is to use tools for on-demand suppression of neuronal and circuit excitability. The first such approach was to use optogenetics. Several laboratories have shown that the inhibitory light-sensitive protein Halorhodopsin can suppress seizure-like discharges in vitro as well as epileptic activity in vivo. A draw-back of optogenetics is that light needs to be delivered to the area of the brain expressing the opsin. This can be achieved with laser-coupled fiber-optics or light-emitting diodes, but these are invasive.  Chemogenetics An alternative approach for on-demand control of circuit excitability that does not require light delivery to the brain is to use chemogenetics. This relies on expressing a mutated receptor in the seizure focus, which does not respond to endogenous neurotransmitters but can be activated by an exogenous drug. G-protein coupled receptors mutated in this way are called Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). Success in treating epilepsy has been reported using the inhibitory DREADD hM4D(Gi), which is derived from the M4 muscarinic receptor. AAV-mediated expression of hM4D(Gi) in a rodent model of focal epilepsy on its own had no effect, but when activated by the drug clozapine N-oxide it suppressed seizures. The treatment had no detectable side effects and is, in principle, suited for clinical translation. Olanzapine has been identified as a full and potent activator of hM4D(Gi). A 'closed-loop' variant of chemogenetics to stop seizures, which avoids the need for an exogenous ligand, relies on a glutamate-gated chloride channel which inhibits neurons whenever the extracellular concentration of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate rises.  CRISPR A mouse model of Dravet syndrome has been treated using a variant of CRISPR that relies on a guide RNA and a dead Cas9 (dCas9) protein to recruit transcriptional activators to the promoter region of the sodium channel gene Scn1a in interneurons. Non-viral approaches Magnetofection is done through the use of super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with polyethylenimine. Iron oxide nanoparticles are ideal for biomedical applications in the body due to their biodegradable, cationic, non-toxic, and FDA-approved nature. Under gene transfer conditions, the receptors of interest are coated with the nanoparticles. The receptors will then home in and travel to the target of interest. Once the particle docks, the DNA is delivered to the cell via pinocytosis or endocytosis. Upon delivery, the temperature is increased ever so slightly, lysing the iron oxide nanoparticle and releasing the DNA. Overall, the technique is useful for combatting slow vector accumulation and low vector concentration at target areas. The technique is also customizable to the physical and biochemical properties of the receptors by modifying the characteristics of the iron oxide nanoparticles. Future implications The use of gene therapy in treating neurological disorders such as epilepsy has presented itself as an increasingly viable area of ongoing research with the primary targets being somatostatin, galanin, neuropeptide y, potassium channels, optogenetics and chemogenetics for epilepsy. As the field of gene therapy continues to grow and show promising results for the treatment of epilepsy among other diseases, additional research needs to be done in ensuring patient safety, developing alternative methods for DNA delivery, and finding feasible methods for scaling up delivery volumes.

It can be found along the Atlantic coast of North and South America, ranging from Virginia to Patagonia. Description The crested oyster is a rather irregular triangular or oval shape and grows to a length of about . The two valves are quite different; the left one is deeply concave, has a raised margin and is fixed to the substrate while the right one is flattish and fits inside the other. The valves are thick with variable surface sculpturing, the whitish colour being obscured by mud, algal growth and encrusting organisms. The inside of the valves is pearly grey or greenish, and the muscle scar is colourless, a fact that distinguishes this species from the much larger eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) which has a purple muscle scar. Distribution and habitat The species is found in shallow water on the Atlantic coast of North, Central and South America. Its range extends from Virginia in the United States southwards to San Mat√≠as Gulf in Patagonia. It grows on rocks, shells, jetties, oil platforms and other hard substrates in the subtidal zone.Abbott, R.T.; Morris, P.A. A Field Guide to Shells: Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and the West Indies. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1995. 35. Uses The crested oyster has been eaten by humans for at least 6,000 years; the empty shells have been found in shell middens dating to that period on the coast of the Santa Luc√≠a River basin where there were lagoons beside the estuary. Other mollusc remains found in these middens include the bivalves Mytilus edulis and Plicatula gibbosa, which grow on hard surfaces, and Erodona mactroides, Tagelus plebeius, Mactra sp., Anomalocardia flexuosa, and the gastropods Buccinanops deformis and Heleobia sp., all of which are found on soft sediment in the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones; this suggests that they were gathered locally from the estuarine environment.

History It was circumscribed by A. Raillo in 1929 for two species, P. roseus and P. vinaceus. No type specimens were retained by Raillo. In 1972, Samson designated a neotype for P. roseus, recognized three species (P. roseus Raillo, P. bhattii Samson and P. caucasicus Cejp & Milko) and synonymized P. vinaceus with P. roseus. In 1982, M√ºller described a fourth species, P. alpinus. In 2006, Rice and Currah described two additional species, P. appendiculatus and P. verrucosus. In 2013, Geomyces destructans the casual agent of bat white nose syndrome was transferred to this genus and is now referred to as P. destructans. Since 2006, intensive cave sampling has identified numerous Pseudogymnoascus isolates that have yet to be described. Species Characteristics Pseudogymnoascus alpinus M√ºller ascospores are described as navicular-fusiform in shape and hyaline to yellow in color. Typically, one side of the ascospore is flattened with 3 longitudinal rims. M√ºller collected P. alpinus from soil below Winter Heath in Switzerland. Pseudogymnoascus appendiculatus Rice & Currah differs from other Pseudogymnoascus species by the presence of long, pigmented, branched peridial appendages. The ascospores have a longitudinal rim or are otherwise described as smooth. This species was initially isolated from rotten black spruce wood found under Sphagnum peat in Canada. Pseudogymnoascus bhattii Samson has single-celled, hyaline to yellow fusiform ascospores which are described as flattened on one side. No anamorph (asexual state) was described. Samson isolated this species from alpine tundra soil in Canada and Alaska and stated that it could grow from 10 ¬∞C to 25 ¬∞C. Pseudogymnoascus caucasicus Cejp & Milko described this species as having stalked chlamydospore-like structures and no ascomata. This species was initially isolated from forest soil in Georgia. In 1982, M√ºller noted that the type culture was sterile. Pseudogymnoascus destructans Minnis & Lindner was initially described in 2009 as Geomyces destructans by Gargas et al. In 2013, further analysis of the phylogenetic relationship moved this species to the genus Pseudogymnoascus. The conidium of this species are hyaline and characteristically curved.Pseudogymnoascus destructans in culture demonstrating characteristic curved conidia in blue/purple. This species was first isolated from infected hibernating bats in New York state. Recently, this species has been isolated from cave environments no longer inhabited by hibernating bats. Pseudogymnoascus roseus Raillo has smooth ascospores that are ellipsoid to fusiform and can vary from yellow to reddish brown. Conidia are typically hyaline in color and globose to ellipsoid in shape. The base of the conidia are truncate. Pseudogymnoascus roseus is frequently isolated from soil, root and wood samples. Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus Rice & Currah is distinguished by the presence of warts that covers the ascospore surface. In contrast, the conidia are described as smooth to asperulate. This species was also isolated from the same substrate and locality as Pseudogymnoascus appendiculatus. Ecology Many Pseudogymnoascus species are cellulolytic, function as saprotrophs and are either psychrophilic or psychrotolerant. Pseudogymnoascus roseus was able to form an ericoid mycorrhizal association in vitro and Pseudogymnoascus destructans infects hibernating bat and survives in the cave environment as a saprotroph. M√ºller indicated that all known Pseudogymnoascus species, prior to 1982, were not known to be keratinolytic.

Etymology The species name refers to the broad sacculus and is derived from Latin amplus (meaning large, ample)., 2007, Shilap Revista de Lepidopterologia, volume 35 (137): 33-46 (2007) References Category:Moths described in 2007 Category:Cuproxena Category:Moths of South America Category:Taxa named by J√≥zef Razowski ","title":"Cuproxena amplana"},{"id":"41051402","text":"RGG may refer to: * Random geometric graph, a concept in mathematical graph theory * Responsible Government Group (2009), a centre-right caucus in the City Council of Toronto, Canada * Ry≈´ ga Gotoku, the game series known as Yakuza in the west ","title":"RGG"},{"id":"41051407","text":"James Calthorpe (died 1658) of Ampton who was Sheriff of Suffolk, in 1656, during the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, by whom he was knighted at Whitehall, 10 December, in the same year. Biography Calthorpe was the third son, and the only one of ten children of Sir Henry Calthorpe and his wife Dorothy (daughter and heiress of Edward Humphrey) to survive to adulthood. He was educated at Catherine Hall, Cambridge. He and was Sheriff of Suffolk, in 1656, during the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, by whom he was knighted at Whitehall, 10 December, in the same year. James Calthorpe survived his father by twenty-one years, being interred in the chancel of Ampton Church the same day of the month on which Sir Henry died, 1 August 1658. Family Calthorpe married Dorothy, second daughter of Sir James Reynolds, of Castle Camps, Cambridgeshire, and sister to Sir John Reynolds, Commissary-General in Ireland, on whose death she became his sole heiress). They had three sons and six daughters who were still living when he died in August 1658: *James (1649‚Äì1702), was nine years old when his father died. He inhered his father's, estate and during his adult life endowed a hospital for boys in Ampton (It was a school for six pupils). He did not marry and his brother Christopher inherited the estate. *Christopher (1652‚Äì1717), he married Elizabeth, one of the daughters and coheirs of Gardiner Kettleborough, of Elmswell in Suffolk, they had two sons, James 1699‚Äì1784) who became a politician and courtier; and Henry (1703‚Äì1780) who became a rector and never married; and three daughters. As Henry predeceased James and he also died unmarried, with his death, the direct male line of his family became extinct. *Reynolds(1655‚Äì1719). He was a member of parliament, married twice and had several children. *Henrietta-Mary. *Dorothy (1648‚Äì1693) she bequeathed ¬£1,000 for the endowment of an alms-house in Ampton, for six poor old widows or old maids of the age of sixty years and upwards and another ¬£500 to help apprentice poor boys into handicraft trades in the town of Bury St. Edmunds. She died unmarried. *Barbara (born 1651). *Katherine, (1656‚Äì1707), on 10 February 1680 married the Rev.

Work in his laboratory in the late 1960s established the existence of unique nociceptors. Perl was one of the founding members of the Society for Neuroscience and served as its first president. He was a Sarah Graham Kenan Professor of Cell Biology & Physiology and a member of the UNC Neuroscience Center at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.  Early life and military training  Perl was born in Chicago, Illinois to John and Blanche Perl, natives of Hungary and Czechoslovakia, respectively. As a child, Perl was fascinated by electricity, which led to an interest in electronics, radio, and the sciences. In college at the University of Chicago, Perl focused on physics and engineering, but a conversation with his father, who was a physician and surgeon, convinced him to pursue a career in medicine as a means of studying human physiology. While in college, Perl was accepted into the U.S. Navy's Officer Training Program. He served as a medical trainee at the V-12 Navy College Training Program at the Great Lakes Naval Station (Chicago) in the summer of 1945 and began studies at the University of Illinois School of Medicine (Chicago) in the fall of 1945, at which time he was discharged into the naval reserves with the end of WWII. Perl earned his Bachelor of Science degree in 1947 and his M.D. in 1949.Perl, Edward. Edward R. Perl. The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography, Volume 3. Ed. Larry R. Squire. San Diego: Academic Press, 2001. pp. 366-413.  Early research career  Perl's first exposure to neuroscience came at the University of Illinois School of Medicine's Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute (Chicago), where he worked for a time as a part- time graduate student in Warren S. McCulloch‚Äôs laboratory and where he met, among other notables of the time, Elwood Henneman, whose experiments on spinal reflexes and supraspinal control of motor function were to influence Perl's later research path. A project undertaken in the laboratory of cardiac physiologist William V. Whitehorn in the late 1940s led to Perl's first scientific paper, published in Science in 1949.Whitehorn WV and Perl ER. The principles behind the device Perl designed for this project became the foundation for impedance cardiography. This work earned Perl a master's degree in 1951. In the summer of 1948 Perl had served as a clerk on the Harvard Medical Service of Boston City Hospital, where his interactions with neurologist and neuroscience researcher Derek Denny-Brown steered Perl toward a career in neurophysiology. Perl began a postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Philip Bard in the Department of Physiology at Johns Hopkins University in the fall of 1950; there he met neuroanatomist Jerzy Rose and neurophysiologist Vernon Mountcastle, who would become a lifelong mentor in surgical and electrophysiological recording techniques. During this time Perl became interested in how the activity of C-fiber afferent neurons was transferred to the cerebral cortex, a project that proved difficult, but which influenced his interest in these unmyelinated afferent fibers and their then- presumed participation in the detection and transmission of pain and temperature sensations to the brain. Perl was called to active duty as a naval physician in January, 1952, and served as a medical officer at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, where he joined a neuroscience research group led by David McKenzie Rioch and staffed by Robert Galambos, Michael Fuortes, Walle Nauta, and David Whitlock.  First faculty positions  In 1954 Perl accepted a faculty position at the State University of New York, College of Medicine, Syracuse (now known as SUNY Upstate Medical University), where he not only researched crossed spinal reflexes, but also renewed his interest in the activity of C-fiber afferent fibers and their projections to the spinal cord. Perl left SUNY-Syracuse in 1957 to join the University of Utah‚Äôs Department of Physiology, then led by neurophysiologist Carlton C. Hunt. Perl‚Äôs work at Utah focused on spinothalamic somatosensory pathways and the interactions between primary afferent neurons and spinal dorsal column nuclei. Beginning in 1962, Perl spent a year in Yves Laporte's laboratory at the Facult√© de M√©decine in Toulouse, France. His time in Europe enabled him to meet with and observe French neurophysiologists Paul Bessou, Albert Fessard, Denise Albe-Fessard, Pierre Buser, Jean-Marie Besson, and Hungarian neuroanatomists J√°nos (John) Szent√°gothai and Mikl√≥s R√©thelyi. A visit with neurophysiologist Ainsley Iggo at the University of Edinburgh proved vital in allowing Perl expertise in recording the electrical activity of C-fibers. He would repeat trips to France over the coming decades in order to engage in collaborative research with European colleagues.  Documentation of nociceptors  Perl‚Äôs return to the University of Utah in 1963 marked the beginning of a research interest in primary afferent neurons, which evolved into a focus on nociceptors. Paul Bessou visited Perl‚Äôs laboratory and the two documented the activities of mechanoreceptive primary afferent neurons, whose thinly myelinated afferent fibers were responsive to non-noxious mechanical stimulation.Bessou P and Perl ER. A movement receptor of the small intestine. J. Physiol. (London) 182:404-426, 1966. Pioneering experiments in cats with then-graduate student Paul Richards Burgess demonstrated the existence of a class of thinly myelinated primary-afferent fibers that only responded to noxious (nociceptive) mechanical stimulation;Mason P. Placing pain on the sensory map: Classic papers by Ed Perl and colleagues. J. Neurophysiol. 97: 1871-1873, 2007. Burgess and Perl (1967) described in depth this class of high-threshold mechanoreceptor, using ‚Äúnociceptor,‚Äù a term coined by Charles Sherrington in 1906, to identify these neurons.Burgess PR and Perl ER. Myelinated afferent fibres responding specifically to noxious stimulation of the skin. J. Physiol. (London) 190: 541-562, 1967. The work by Burgess and Perl represents the first thorough documentation of a large sample of nociceptors, primary afferent neurons that detect stimuli capable of causing tissue injury and transmit information about these insults centrally. (Previous work by Ainsley Iggo had provided a small sample of primary afferent fibers that are now understood to have been C-polymodal nociceptors.Iggo A. Cutaneous heat and cold receptors with slowly conducting (C) afferent fibres. Q. J. Exp. Physiol. Cogn. Med. Sci. 44: P362-P370, 1959.) Perl extended these studies to primate, showing the existence of high-threshold mechanoreceptors in squirrel monkey.Perl ER. Myelinated afferent fibres innervating the primate skin and their response to noxious stimuli. J. Physiol. (London) 197: 593-615, 1968. Further experiments with Bessou not only revealed the complexity of myelinated and unmyelinated nociceptors, but also thoroughly documented the existence and properties of C-polymodal nociceptors, which respond to a variety of noxious stimuli.Bessou P and Perl ER. Response of cutaneous sensory units with unmyelinated fibers to noxious stimuli. J. Neurophysiol. 32: 1025-1043, 1969. Later experiments with Lawrence Kruger and Mathius \\"Skip\\" J. Sedivec in Perl's laboratory in the late 1970s (after Perl had moved to the University of North Carolina) examined the fine structure of peripheral endings of cutaneous high-threshold mechanoreceptors (nociceptors) in cats.Kruger L, Perl ER, and Sedivec MJ. Fine structure of myelinated mechanical nociceptor endings in cat hairy skin. J. Comp. Neurol. 198: 137-154, 1981. In parallel with this work at the University of North Carolina, Perl and co-workers sought to correlate how stimulating individual cutaneous nociceptors in awake human volunteers is experienced by these subjects; the resulting study proved the linkage between activation of identified nociceptors and the subjective experience of pain in humans.Konietzny F, Perl ER, Trevino D, Light A, and Hensel H. Sensory experiences in man evoked by intraneural electrical stimulation of intact cutaneous afferent fibers. Exp. Br. Res. 42: 219-222, 1981.  Central projections of nociceptors and nociceptive spinal circuitry  While still at the University of Utah, Perl and Burgess Christensen, then a post-doctoral fellow, determined that the marginal zone (lamina I) of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord contained neurons that were responsive to different kinds of noxious and innocuous stimuli from the periphery.Christensen BN and Perl ER. Spinal neurons specifically excited by noxious or thermal stimuli: marginal zone of the dorsal horn. J. Neurophysiol. 33: 293-307, 1970. Experiments with Takao Kumazawa in the late 1960s into the mid-1970s confirmed in monkey observations about unmyelinated primary afferent fibers and their central projections that had earlier been seen in cats.Kumazawa T and Perl ER.

These studies made clear that areas of the superficial dorsal horn served as integration sites for nociceptive and non- nociceptive information received from the periphery. Perl continued this work after he left the University of Utah to become chair of the Department of Physiology at the University of North Carolina in 1971. In the mid-1970s Alan R. Light, Mikl√≥s R√©thelyi, and Daniel Trevino joined Perl's laboratory to further map the central terminations of thinly-myelinated primary afferent neurons, to study their synaptic morphologies, and to characterize neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord that were responsive to activity of these fibers.Light AR and Perl ER.

Neurol. 207: 381-393, 1982. In a methodological tour de force, Perl worked with Yasuo Sugiura and Chong Lee in the mid-1980s to physiologically characterize and label (with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin) unmyelinated C-fibers. These studies revealed for the first time a functional organization to the central termination pattern of unmyelinated afferents with different response profiles to skin stimulation.Sugiura Y, Lee CL, and Perl, ER. Central projections of identified, unmyelinated (C) afferent fibers innervating mammalian skin. Science 234: 358-361, 1986. Experiments performed by Christopher Honda, Siegfried Mense, and Perl in the early 1980s demonstrated that neurons located in specific areas of the cat thalamus were responsive to noxious stimulation of the skin of the hindlimb.Honda CN, Mense S, and Perl ER. Neurons in the ventrobasal region of the cat thalamus selectively responsive to strong mechanical stimulation. J. Neurophysiol. 49: 662-678, 1983. As a whole, studies in the Perl laboratory in the 1970s and 1980s helped clarify a specific pattern of somatosensory (principally nociceptive) input to the spinal cord and brain and established the foundation for a circuitry devoted to the processing of noxious stimuli from the periphery. The last decades of work in the Perl laboratory were principally devoted to characterizing the functional organization of the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord and understanding how spinal neurons located within these regions interact with one another to process signals arising from the periphery. These experiments involved recording from neurons responsive to various types of primary afferent input and correlating these functional signatures with morphological features of the spinal neurons in question. This work in part resulted in the systematic categorization by Timothy Grudt and Perl of functionally characterized spinal neurons based on their morphological features and location within the dorsal horn.Grudt TJ and Perl ER. Correlations between neuronal morphology and electrophysiological features in the rodent superficial dorsal horn. J. Physiol. (London) 540: 189-207, 2002. Experiments with Yan Lu and Jihong Zheng were aimed at a better understanding of connections between spinal neurons and how afferent input from the periphery is modulated by these connections.Lu Y and Perl ER.

Inhibitory neurones of the spinal substantia gelatinosa mediate interaction of signals from primary afferents. J. Physiol. (London) 588: 2065-2075, 2010. Perl's experiments with Adam Hantman focused on a unique, homogeneous population of Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing neurons in the spinal substantia gelatinosa of a transgenic mouse. Hantman and Perl physiologically characterized these neurons, showing them to be inhibitory in nature and responsive only to unmyelinated afferents with a conduction velocity at the high end of the C-fiber range; they also demonstrated the highly specific connections of these GFP-expressing neurons with other types of neurons in the substantia gelatinosa.Hantman AW, van den Pol AN, and Perl ER.

Founding of the Society for Neuroscience  At the suggestion of neurophysiologist Ralph W. Gerard, whose idea it was to establish a Society for Neuroscience, Perl chaired a committee of fellow neuroscientists in 1969, the aim of which was to lay the groundwork for the function of the nascent society. As a founding member, Perl was elected president, but chose to take the title of acting president (1969‚Äì1970) until a president could be elected democratically by a representative membership. He felt that it was important for the society to attract young investigators who are active in the laboratory.Perl, Edward. \\"Society for Neuroscience -- A History of Beginnings,\\" In: The Society for Neuroscience's Neuroscience Newsletter 17(4): 2-5, 1986.  Awards and honors  Among other recognitions for his contributions to neuroscience, Perl was awarded the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Research on Pain in 1991 and the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience in 1998.Spector, B. People: Fourth Bristol-Myers Squibb Pain Award is Presented to UNC Nociceptor Pioneer. The Scientist, 20 January 1992. He was elected a Fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992.  Establishment of the Perl-UNC Prize  In 2000 Perl endowed a national prize to be given annually to investigators who have made significant contributions to neuroscience through outstanding discoveries or seminal insights. In establishing the Perl-UNC Neuroscience Prize, Perl noted that ‚Äúthe prize allows me to acknowledge the University of North Carolina for the opportunities it has given me‚Äù and, further, that it would be a tribute to the strength of the neuroscience research program at the University.Lang, Les. National Prize in Neuroscience Endowed by UNC-CH Professor. UNC News Service Press Release, 14 January 2000, No. 18. As of 2014, six recipients of the Perl-UNC Prize have gone on to win Nobel Prizes in either Physiology/Medicine (Linda Buck, Richard Axel, May-Britt Moser, Edvard Moser) or Chemistry (Roger Tsien, Roderick MacKinnon).

Incidents at the University of Texas In 2012, there were multiple incidences of balloons allegedly filled with bleach thrown at students between the months of June and September at the University of Texas. Four students filed reports with the UT police department, which were followed by protests from students, faculty, and alumni. The students who filed reports came forward once they were contacted by the UT police department. They had heard of the incidents and were concerned as to why the students had not already reported what happened. The students reported that the incidents took place near apartments in West Campus, an area located just off campus. The UT police have not been able to prove that there was in fact bleach in the balloons, but it has been investigated. The most recent incident occurred on August 21, 2013 to a 21-year-old student by the name of Bryan Davis while walking to a friend's house. He was reportedly struck in the leg by a bleach-filled balloon while walking by an apartment in West Campus. This event was also looked at as being not only physically dangerous, but potentially racially driven. However, upon further investigation and forensic testing, the balloon was confirmed to only have contained water. Other occurrences In 2010, a bleach balloon attack was reported in Atlanta, Georgia. It was reported that four high school students threw bleach balloons from a van at a Hispanic, male seventh grader who was walking home from school. The seventh grader, Miguel Mesa, was temporarily blinded upon being struck directly in the face. Two of Mesa's classmates called the police and were able to describe the van's appearance. The driver of the van was identified and arrested, the other three turned themselves in. The suspects told police they were only trying to ruin Mesa's clothing. No information was given or discussed on the possibilities of the attack having racist intentions. Mesa's vision returned after undergoing numerous medical treatments. Further back, in 2005, another racial attack with the use of bleach was reported in the Netherlands. A 16-year-old girl from Ethiopia was walking with some friends when a 25-year-old male threw bleach on her. As he threw the bleach he yelled, \\"This will make you whiter\\". The girl was not seriously hurt, and the man was arrested for assault and hate speech. Defense and related incidents The response from the university is that the balloon thrown in August 2013 appears to have been filled with only water, and they sent clothing and pieces of the balloon away for further forensic testing. Authorities claim that they had difficulty verifying that these were racially motivated because there were reports that claim that non-minority students have been hit also but the fact remains that a majority of students targeted have indeed been minority. Sources who were interviewed by the Huffington Post, who wished to be remain anonymous, claimed that as early as 2007, there had been bleach-filled balloons dropped on groups of women participating in sorority rush. They also claimed that bleach-bombing incidents are common and may occur \\"maybe once or twice a month.\\" See also *Acid throwing References Category:Balloons (entertainment) Category:Chemical weapons attacks Category:Projectiles ","title":"Bleach balloon"},{"id":"41051489","text":"Lafour Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in North Savadkuh County, Mazandaran Province, Iran.

It also authorizes grants and demonstration programs to be run by the Health Resources and Services Administration that will try to decrease preterm births. The bill passed the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Background Similar legislation was introduced in 2012 during the 112th United States Congress. That bill, , passed in the Senate. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Reauthorization Act or PREEMIE Reauthorization Act would amend the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act to revise and reauthorize requirements for research on prematurity and preterm births. The bill would authorize the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to: (1) conduct epidemiological studies (as currently required) on the clinical, biological, social, environmental, genetic, and behavioral factors related to prematurity, as appropriate; (2) conduct activities to improve national data to facilitate tracking preterm births; and (3) continue efforts to prevent preterm birth through the identification of opportunities for prevention and the assessment of their impact. The bill would authorize the Director of the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth to give preference in awarding grants to an eligible entity that proposes to use the grant funds to develop plans for, or to establish, telehealth networks that provide prenatal care for high-risk pregnancies. The bill would revise and reauthorize through FY2017 the authority of the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct demonstration projects related to preterm births. The bill would include as activities under such projects programs to test and evaluate various strategies to provide information and education to health care providers and the public on: (1) the core risk factors for preterm labor and delivery, medically indicated deliveries before full term, (2) the importance of preconception and prenatal care, (3) treatments and outcomes for premature infants, (4) meeting the informational needs of families during the stay of an infant in a neonatal intensive care unit, and (5) utilization of evidence-based strategies to prevent birth injuries. The bill would authorize as additional activities under such projects the establishment of programs to increase the availability, awareness, and use of pregnancy and post-term information services that provide evidence-based, clinical information through counselors, community outreach efforts, electronic or telephonic communication, or other appropriate means regarding causes associated with prematurity, birth defects, or health risks to a post-term infant. The bill would repeal the establishment of the Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight. The bill would authorize the Secretary to establish the Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality. The bill would direct the Advisory Committee (or an existing advisory committee designated by the Secretary) to develop, and periodically review and revise, a plan for conducting and supporting research, education, and programs on preterm birth through HHS. Finally, the bill would require the Secretary to designate an appropriate agency within HHS to coordinate existing studies and report to the Secretary and Congress on hospital readmissions of preterm infants. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on February 13, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 252 would amend provisions of the Public Health Service Act that authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct research and education activities relating to preterm labor and delivery and infant mortality. Those activities would be implemented by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The bill also would authorize the Secretary to establish a council that would provide advice and recommendations on research, education, and programs on preterm birth through the United States Department of Health and Human Services. For the activities described above, the bill would authorize the appropriation of about $10 million a year for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the bill would cost $4 million in 2014 and $42 million over the 2014-2018 period, assuming the appropriation of the authorized amounts. Pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The PREEMIE Reauthorization Act was introduced into the Senate on February 7, 2013 by Sen. Lamar Alexander (R, TN). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. On September 25, 2013, the Senate voted by a voice vote to pass the bill. The PREEMIE Reauthorization Act was received in the United States House of Representatives on September 26, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act would be considered under a suspension of the rules on the House floor on November 12, 2013. Debate and discussion The March of Dimes spoke out in favor of the bill, urging people to tell Congress that they support the bill.

It pays homage to the cast of The Walking Dead TV series and features a trench-coated zombie slayer armed with a fan fret acoustic guitar equipped with optional head stock blade, body blade, variable angle chainsaw and a flame thrower whammy bar. Scary as that might be, musically there is nothing dead about this vibrant collection of 12 original compositions. In fact, the only scary thing here is that Alder's infectious fretwork will leave an indelible imprint in your musical memory. The highly accoladed Alder has attained more fret-cred than, perhaps any other fingerstylist over the past eight or nine years, yet there is no sense that he has any intention of resting on his laurels if this often energetic and engaging CD is any indication. Much like his last release, Not a Planet, Alder offers a variety of sonic flavors and styles with technique and execution that are precise and so very fluid. There is an improvisational feel to the performances on Armed & Dangerous that create an immediacy that is fast becoming an Alder trademark. \\"Going Rogue\\" opens the CD with a deceptively intricate and eloquent intro before sliding, literally and sonically, head long in a tasty, yet funky grove that burst continually in unexpected melodic directions - as if the fret board of Alder's baritone guitar were a roller coaster and his fingers were alternately delighted, thrilled and hanging on for dear life. Before you have time to recover from the opening track, Alder lets loose \\"Love & Life,\\" perhaps the most beautiful and satisfying vocal tunes he has ever penned, complete with full band accompaniment and violins that heighten the melody and Alder's spot on vocals. If I weren't for the phenomenal guitar work throughout this album, \\"Love & Life,\\" would be my favorite track. As he has proven before, the man can flat-out sing! \\"Dancing with Spin Doctors,\\" adds a whole new aspect to Alder's repertoire. He lays down and electric finger-style groove with help from Billy Sheehan on bass and Sam Cartwright on drums that has Eric Johnson-esque overtones and feels completely at home nestled in amongst the acoustic bulk of this collection. For sheer beauty both \\"Sophrosyne\\" and \\"Precious Moments\\" show the delicate side of Alder's fretwork as he coaxes sweetness from a baritone guitar that I haven't heard since Pat Metheny's One Quiet Night. Other highlights include \\"Circuitous,\\" a fingerstyle gem and the spirited \\"Three Good Reasons To Play,\\" a duet written and with Luca Francioso. Not surprisingly, the release of Armed & Dangerous coincides with Don Alder's name appearing on the cover of Guitar Player Magazine. Go figure...\\" James Filkins 2008 Not a Planet: \\"Acoustic fingerstyle soloist Don Alder branches out to sit in with a number of players on nine of the 13 tunes on this recording. The 2007 Winfield International Guitar Fingerstyle Champion even sings on two tracks. (He sings well enough to front a band.) Collaborations like \\"The Wall\\" yield a polished, rootsy pop. The ambient textures of \\"Sayonara.calm,\\" a duet with Michael Manring, border on a new age vocabulary. The solo \\"He Said, She Said\\" puts the melody right out front of a shuffle. The track reveals Alder's remarkable fluidity and ability to make clear statements. \\"Taiwan Traffic Jam\\" cuts out in a Willy Porter vein, with a driving urgency that showcases pure chops rooted in a strong, chiming melody. Overall, Alder proves he plays well with others on this outing. The emotional content is amorphous, yet specific to the moment at hand. At times you can feel an almost cinematic sensibility behind it.\\" Steve KlingamanMinor7th 2007 Acoustic Matters: \\"Acoustic Matters is a collection of interesting and sometimes fun pieces showing off Alder's abilities. There are 10 tunes with comical titles listed on the album's cover art. Alder's album is appropriately titled since every track is only the man and his acoustic guitar.\\"Rambles.net 2005 Take the Train, eh: \\"Canada is one of the places where many finger-style guitarists have their residence. Don Alder lives in Vancouver and has been a guitarist/ composer over 23 years. He performed with Don Ross, Alex de Grassi, Peppino D'Agostino among others. Also Don was a competitor in the prestigious U.S. National Finger-style Guitar Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Don Alder's influences come from guitar players like Michael Hedges, Don Ross and for instance Bruce Cockburn. His new album Take the Train Eh. is a groovy and up tempo album with extraordinary techniques on his selected guitars. He uses Greenfield, Lowden and Jenkins guitars, which all have their own unique sound. This album is a solo guitar album without Don's warm expressive voice. Don starts off with Dr. Dr. which is full of astonishing techniques as tapping, slapping, percussion and a brilliant groove. Meeting Pierre is in the style of Pierre Bensusan, who also as Don plays a lot in DADGAD tuning. This song embodies a lot of space and structure with a fine gentle touch. The album would even impress more if Don focused more on melody line building and not primary on skilled techniques. Chet or Cheese shows his admiration for Chet Atkins in a top-notch composition. One of my favorites is Its Only Goodbye which has all a good song needs, balance, structure and emotion. Tommy Time is an ode to Tommy Emmanuel with the typical melody lines and staccato approach. One thing is clear Don Alder has an own significant signature which covers all capabilities in finger-style music. Don Alder writes all his songs himself which can compete with the best guitarists in the circuit. Seldom one sees so much quality and versatility in one guitarist. Don Alder succeeds with this album to impress any serious acoustic guitarist and listener.\\"Henk te Veldhuis ‚Äì Bridge Guitar Reviews 2005 Best of Don Alder: \\"Don Alder compiles a dozen gems from his collection that's as pleasant as it's impressive. Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Alder intertwines his fingerpicking with percussion on his soundboard for a smooth but surprisingly propulsive effect. This solo, acoustic, instrumental disc features Alden's own compositions, which are invariably marked by their expressiveness. They range from the galloping Western of \\"Nutberry Farm\\" to the bittersweet \\"Marshall's Lanai\\" to the swinging \\"Granny on the Run.\\" His liner notes reveal compositional tidbits, adding to the fun, and also offer a glimpse into the huge heart of this versatile musician.\\" Fred KrausMinor7th 2003 Acoustiholic: \\"Most artists who arrive on the scene with acoustic guitar- in-hand proclaim themselves as either fingerstylists or singer-songwriters, but hardly ever both. Don Alder is an artist able to wear both hats quite comfortably. The former Winfield competitor and student of Don Ross can kick up his heels instrumentally (as on \\"Granny on the Run\\") but can also put his vocals and songwriting up on ear-catching display (\\"Haunting Me\\").\\" Alan FarkMinor7th  Media feedback  Penticton Herald: \\"Don Alder, the King of Strings.\\" Vancouver magazine: \\"Don Alder is widely acclaimed as one of the finest acoustic guitarists in the world.\\" Guitar Player Magazine: \\"He hasn‚Äôt stopped blowing minds\\" \\"In einer sehr melodi√∂sen Klangsprache entfaltet der Meister der Gitarre einen Song ohne Worte, ein musikalisches Zwiegespr√§ch zwischen zwei \\"Stimmen\\" seiner Gitarre.\\" (WAZ Herne, 12/2016 - With his very melodic sound language the guitar virtuoso creates a song without words, a dialogue between two \\"voices\\" of his guitar.) \\"Diese scheinbare Leichtigkeit bei gleichzeitig hochkar√§tiger Qualit√§t und atemberaubender Geschwindigkeit, das ist die eigentliche Kunst.\\" (RP Neuss, 04/2016 - Making it look simple but deliver high quality with breathtaking speed - that's his artistry.) \\"Don Alder ist nicht nur Gitarrist, sondern auch S√§nger. Seine Songs sind auch deswegen abwechslungsreich, weil er sie zum Teil auf einer Harfengitarre spielt, die Alders Klangspektrum noch einmal erweitert.\\" (NOZ, 09/2017) - Don Alder is not only a guitarist, but also a singer/songwriter. He's offering a big variety of songs by using different types of guitars, f.e. his harp guitar, which offers a wider sound spectrum than a normal acoustic guitar. \\"Der Kanadier ist der international mit den meisten Titeln ausgezeichnete Gitarrist und manchmal denkt man, es w√ºrde nicht nur ein Gitarrenspieler auf der B√ºhne stehen.\\" (Leverkusen, 11/2017) - The Canadian is an international successful guitarist who won several awards, and sometimes his music sounds like there is not only guitarist on stage.

His work as an archivist includes a complete digitization of Paul Krassner's counterculture magazine The Realist, and the website Comics with Problems, which has been featured on multiple segments of The Rachel Maddow Show. As a comics artist, he has been published by Fantagraphics, and received media attention for his website projects, including two projects with artist and co-collaborator Scott Marshall; a downloadable Halloween mask based on Senator Larry Craig and a Tijuana Bible based on George W. Bush and John McCain. The Larry Craig Halloween Mask, a downloadable paper mask designed to be fit over a paper bag, received widespread media attention, including Air America, CBS News, and the Washington papers Politico and Roll Call. Other satires on Persoff's website include an entire cosmetic line of Sarah Palin lipstick, and an audio piece of an angered Mitt Romney supporter blended with orchestral music that went quickly viral on the Internet until being forced offline. From 2009 through 2011, Persoff served as art director for Barney Rosset's Evergreen Review. While working for the magazine, he also contributed two pieces of writing, a profile of the beat poet recording project Paris Records and a report on George W Bush's first post-presidential appearance as a motivational speaker, entitled \\"A Day Spent In Hell.\\" Since 2013, Persoff has been working on a comics biography with Scott Marshall of underground journalist John Wilcock. The strip is serialized on the website Boing Boing, and has been recognized by Print, The New Yorker and New York magazines.  Archival Work  Persoff's website is recognized for its archive of scanned files of rare and unusual comics. The available titles on the site vary from the mundane, such as travel comics and educational booklets, to the disturbing, including comics that focus on drug use and racism. Socially conscious work is included as well, including a scan of the 1957 comic book Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story. In 2006, Persoff acquired an original copy of the comic (indicating only a handful of copies were then known to exist), scanned it, and posted it on his blog for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.Persoff, Ethan. \\"The 1956 International Bilingual Dr Martin Luther King Jr Comic Book Message,\\" Ethan Persoff's blog (early January 2006). In 2008, Persoff reported that the Cairo director of the American Islamic Congress (AIC) had translated the scanned comic into Arabic and Persian. The AIC's HAMSA (Hands Across the Mideast Support Alliance) initiative printed 2,500 copies of the translated comic, distributing them throughout Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Yemen.Persoff, Ethan. \\"HOW EP.TC IS UNINTENTIONALLY CONTRIBUTING TO WORLD PEACE,\\" Ethan Persoff's blog (March 27, 2008).

Regulation Due to the long absence of governmental regulation, it is uncertain how many foreigners travel to Somalia per year. However, visas and residence permits are now mandatory for all foreign nationals. As of April 2013, the re-established Somali Immigration Department requires all undocumented foreigners to register at its offices in the capital Mogadishu. As part of IOM Somalia's Capacity Building for Migration Management (CBMM) projects, a Migration Information and Data Analysis System (MIDAS) was installed in 2014. The new immigration and border management infrastructure strengthens security by screening travelers at 11 main ports of entry in the country. It in the process registers their biometric data and passport details, and generates statistics for policymakers. In April 2015, the Federal Cabinet also passed a new policy prioritizing the local workforce and restricting the reliance on foreign labour. Demographics Somali expatriates returning from Yemen in Bosaso (2015). As of 2012, most emigrants to Somalia consist of Somali expatriates, who have returned to Mogadishu and other urban areas for investment opportunities and to take part in the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process. Through both private efforts and public initiatives like the Somali Diaspora Corps, they have participated in the renovation of schools, hospitals, banks and other infrastructure, and have played a leading role in the capital's recovery. They have also helped to propel the local real estate market. In 2015, after the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, many returning Somali expatriates as well as various foreign nationals began emigrating from Yemen to northern Somalia. The UN expects the number of foreign nationals to eventually reach 100,000 over the following months. As of September 2014, the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation is scheduled to launch the first population census for Somalia in over two decades. The UNFPA assisted the Ministry in the project, which is slated to be finalized ahead of the planned plebiscite and local and national elections in 2016. Tourism Tourism in Somalia is overseen by the Federal Government of Somalia's Ministry of Tourism. The autonomous Puntland and Somaliland regions maintain their own tourist offices. The industry was traditionally noted for its numerous historical sites, beaches, waterfalls, mountain ranges and national parks. After the start of the civil war in the early 1990s, the Tourism Ministry shut down operations. It was later re-established in the 2000s, and once again oversees the national tourist industry. The Mogadishu- based Somali Tourism Association (SOMTA) also provides on-the-ground consulting services. Citizenship In December 2013, the Federal Government officially launched Somalia's new e-passport. Part of a broader initiative to strengthen security, the passport will be issued by the Ministry of Interior's Department of Immigration. Citizens are eligible for the e-passport upon production of government-issued national identity documents and birth certificates. According to Article 54 of the national constitution, the allocation of powers and resources between the Federal Government and the Federal Republic of Somalia's constituent Federal Member States shall be negotiated and agreed upon by the Federal Government and the Federal Member States, except in matters pertaining to citizenship and immigration, foreign affairs, national defense, and monetary policy.

The school was opened in 1984 at the former Rexdale Junior School before moving to the Heatherbrae Middle School in 1986. It is located next to St. Benedict Roman Catholic Church and Catholic School and was named after Percy Johnson (September 22, 1912 ‚Äì December 22, 1983), a Catholic priest and member of the former Metropolitan Separate School Board. . The motto of the school is Heart Speaks to Heart. History The origins of the school began in November 1983 when Metropolitan Separate School Board (the forerunner to the Toronto Catholic District School Board) and the Archdiocese of Toronto jointly launched a new secondary school to serve northern Etobicoke. With overcrowding at Father Henry Carr, Don Bosco and St. Basil, the MSSB recommended in a February 1984 meeting that the name, Monsignor Percy Johnson, be adopted. On September 4, 1984, the new Monsignor Percy Johnson school was opened in the facilities of the former Rexdale Junior School. Two years later, the school moved into the former Heatherbrae Middle School on Kipling Avenue, built in 1959, which was closed by the Etobicoke Board of Education in June 1985. Throughout its early years Johnson had classes inside a middle school which had features in Etobicoke board standards that Toronto Catholic high schools did not have such as the gymnatorium, cafeteria, and a field of portable classrooms. Due to the size of the gym, home games were relocated elsewhere. In 2004, the TCDSB purchased Heatherbrae from the Toronto District School Board. The old Heatherbrae school was demolished in 2005 and the replacement Johnson building was reconstructed until its completion in 2007, in which the new school opened for classes on September 4 that year. During construction, the student body was relocated to Regina Pacis on Finch and Highway 400. It was officially opened and blessed on May 16, 2008. The new school was designed by ZAS Architects and built by Aquicon Construction and includes a three-storey building with a six-lane track and full-sized sports field. Since then, Johnson is home to over 1000 students serving northern Etobicoke and northwestern North York with ethnic groups ranging from Blacks, Filipinos, Hispanics, Poles, Croatians, Arabs and South Asians. Academics Johnson offers various academic programs and courses ranging from French, English, mathematics, science, geography and technological education. Athletics and extra-curricular activities The school team, known as the Jaguars, offers intramurals, cross country, basketball, volleyball, track, hockey, soccer, badminton and softball. It also offers participation in various memberships in clubs such as Student Council, Yearbook, Empowering Student Partnerships and many others. The English and Drama Departments organize selected theatre trips once in a while.

Combustion system This engine used the Hesselman engine low compression combustion system where oils of varying grades were sprayed into the cylinder during compression but ignition was initiated and assisted by a spark plug. Overhead inlet and exhaust valves, water cooling and a magneto for ignition were standard features. Dimensions The capacity of 4 litres was achieved with a bore of 95 mm and a stroke of 114 mm and it made use of a compression ratio of 6 to 1. Power output was said to be 70 bhp at 2400 rpm. Wobble plate arrangement The wobble plate arrangement cleverly employed a bevel gear set to prevent its rotation around the crankshaft. One bevel gear was fitted to the rear of the wobble plate itself and meshed with another which was fixed to the main body of the engine.

History At the end of the 16th century the Skewbald Horde was led by Vonya, a prince of the upper Narym. Territory along the lower Narym fell under the authority of Prince Kichey who was related to Vonya: his granddaughter was married to Vonya's son, Taybokhta. These princes not only long and stubbornly defended their independence from Moscow and evaded the payment of yasak, but were inclined to go on the offensive. They even entered into relations with K√º√ß√ºm Khan of Sibir for joint action. Only with the construction of Narym ostrog in the 1590s was the Skewbald Horde subdued by Russia. With the submission of the princely families, who dominated the horde up to this point, it did not immediately lose its value. Vonya was succeeded by his son, Taybokhta Vonin, and Kichey by his son Vagay Kicheev, the father-in-law of Taybokhta. They to a certain extent retained their privileged position. In the event of war the troops served together with Russian servicemen. Soon the Narym princes chose to change their position on the ephemeral sovereigns more secure position in royal service. In 1610 Taybokhta Vonin, on his request, was relieved of yasak, and ordered to serve the sovereign and live in Narym ostrog with an annual salary of RUB 3 and 4 chetverik flour, groats and kama, and a pood of salt. He, however, continued to remain at the head of the upper Narym principality with a population of 50 yasak paying people, and his son had to pay yasak. Similarly, the descendants of Kichey began shifting to the role of public service. In the 1620s and 1630s, Vagay continued to be prince of the lower Narym principality, but his brother was baptized, and under the name of Grigoriy Kicheev was in the service in the Narym garrison with a salary of RUB 8, 8 chetverik flour, 2 chetverik groats and 2 poods of salt per year. His cousins, Ivan Boyarko and Olosha Olontayko (Aleksey Alatay) Sanbycheev, also baptized, were enrolled under the same conditions. During the life of Grigoriy Kicheev his son Aleksey entered the service. The same fate apparently befell some of the Parabel Princes: Kirsha Kunyazev with his brothers and children served in \\"all kinds of state service\\", but was not released from yasak and completely ruined. He pledged his wife and children, and only by special decree of Tsar Vasily IV he was given exemption from yasak, and his family was bought back by the treasury. His son Kanna stood at the head of one of the four municipalities of Parabel in 1626 ‚Äî1629. At the same time a member of the family of newly baptized princes, Prince Pyotr Parabelsky served in Surgut among the rank-and-file soldiers and Cossacks.  References  External links  * g. f.

He graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Engineering Physics in 1961. Career Basadur was hired by Procter & Gamble in Hamilton, Ontario and then transferred to the company‚Äôs research and development headquarters in Cincinnati in 1967. He received three U.S patents for his work there and brought several new industrial products to market. While employed in Cincinnati, Basadur became acquainted with the ideas of Sid Parnes, a creativity researcher and teacher at the Creative Problem Solving Institute. Basadur developed his own creativity process within Procter & Gamble to solve problems. He continued to research methods of stimulating and harnessing creativity at Frito-Lay, Ford and Pepsico. During that time, he also earned his MBA from Xavier University and PhD from the University of Cincinnati. His doctoral dissertation received the 1980 S. Rains Wallace Award for research in the area of industrial and organizational psychology By 1981 Basadur had developed a methodology which he called Simplex (\\"simple with an x\\") and a set of related tools for creative problem solving that could be used to improve creative performance in organizations.\\"Jo Staffelbach Heinz: Becoming Solutions-Driven, Not Crisis- Driven\\". D Real Estate, by Jo Staffelbach Heinz . Jul 28, 2011 His method was based on encouraging and facilitating unobstructed thinking and developing a sense of shared ownership and responsibility among participants for the solution they collectively identify. Basadur conducted extensive research to back up his claims that this collaborative process significantly improved the likelihood of successful solutions being identified and implemented. Basadur founded the Center for Research in Applied Creativity to provide training in Simplexity Thinking to corporations, public institutions and governments. To help organizations identify and encourage creative individuals among their staff, Basadur developed the Basadur Creative Problem Solving Profile (CPSP), and Inventory designed to determine an individual‚Äôs style of creative problem solving, by measuring his or her preferred activities within the creativity process. The four styles Basadur identified are generation, conceptualization, optimization and implementation. Basadur also developed a four-stage process for training managers in strategic planning skills. Basadur published two books on the subject of developing creativity, Flight to Creativity: How to dramatically improve your creative performance. in 1994 and The Power of Innovation: How to make innovation a way of life and put creative solutions to work in 1995. He also contributed chapters to a number of books, and published many articles on the subject. He has also made presentations at various scientific meetings.

The system was redesigned in 1981 to use a database, the SMS/800 service management system, which could direct any toll- free number to any destination based on various conditions; number prefixes remained tied to specific carriers until a RespOrg (responsible organisation) structure was introduced in 1993 (US) and 1994 (Canada) to allow subscribers to change providers by providing a Letter of Authorisation (LOA) on company letterhead to their new provider authorising a number to be moved.https://web.archive.org/web/20141111070316/http://www.sms800.com/Controls/NAC/Historyofsms800.aspx  New Zealand  TNAS Limited, a joint venture company owned by Telecom and Vodafone, operates the Toll Free Number Portability system.

History  Shepherd's Hill Academy was founded in 1994 by Trace Embry and his wife Beth. Embry attended Toccoa Falls College (TFC) and work for the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice. During his time at TFC, Embry and his family searched Northeast Georgia for property that would eventually become Shepherd's Hill Academy. Embry purchased a 60-acre tract of land in Martin for $200. From 2001 to 2003, Shepherd's Hill Academy partnered with the Atlanta- based school Gables Academy in a joint effort to provide residential care to families. At that time, the program was known as \\"The Edge at Shepherd's Hill.\\" Now on 185 acres, Shepherd's Hill Academy is an accredited private school and licensed residential care for students and their families.  Governance  Shepherd's Hill Academy is a 501(c)(3) organization governed by a board of directors with responsibilities for assigning an Executive Director, for operational policies and for the annual financial budget. Day- to-day operations are led by the Executive Director. Shepherd's Hill Academy's academic program and faculty are overseen by a Georgia-certified on-site principal. The therapeutic program and residential care are overseen by a licensed therapist.  Private school  Shepherd's Hill Academy's private school is accredited for grades 7-12 through the Georgia Accrediting Commission (GAC) under Education Agency with Special Purposes accreditation.

Friday quotes Dr. Jean Kim, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at George Washington University, \\"...if [Embry] had a licensed professional screen clients and triage them for appropriateness into his program, that would be less worrisome.\\" In the second article in that series Friday described the school as \\"a Georgia-based Christian boarding school with a history of alleged abuse, conversion therapy for LGBTQ teens, and religious indoctrination.\\" He wrote, \\"Trace Embry, who has no medical training or college degree, believes that students who have been diagnosed by professionals with very real and treatable mental illnesses are actually suffering from too much technology use, the overconsumption of media, and a lack of religious conviction.\\"  Media  * Executive Director Trace Embry hosts the radio broadcast License to Parent from a studio at SHA, and is a member of the National Religious Broadcasters. * Embry contributed to the book The Digital Invasion.Dr. Archibald Hart and Dr. Sylvia Hart Frejd.

In December 2007, President of Israel Shimon Peres formally apologised for the massacre.President Peres apologizes for Kafr Qasem massacre of 1956 Haaretz, 21 December 2007 Background Kafr Qasim memorial On the first day of the Suez War, Israel's intelligence service expected Jordan to enter the war on Egypt's side.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p. 289 Acting on this intelligence, soldiers were stationed along the Israeli-Jordanian frontier. From 1949 to 1966, Arab citizens were regarded by Israel as a hostile population, and major Arab population centers were governed by military administrations divided into several districts. As such, several battalions of the Israel Border Police, under the command of Israel Defense Forces brigade commander Colonel Yissachar Shadmi, were ordered to prepare the defense of a section close to the border officially known as the Central District, and colloquially as the Triangle. Timeline On October 29, 1956, the Israeli army ordered that all Arab villages near the Jordanian border be placed under a wartime curfew from 5 p.m. to 6 a.m. on the following day. Any Arab on the streets was to be shot. The order was given to border police units before most of the Arabs from the villages could be notified. Many of them were at work at the time. That morning, Shadmi, who was in charge of the Triangle, received orders to take all precautionary measures to ensure quiet on the Jordanian border. On Shadmi's initiative, the official nightly curfew in the twelve villages under his jurisdiction was changed from the regular hours. Shadmi then gathered all the border patrol battalion commanders under his command, and reportedly ordered them to 'shoot on sight' any villagers violating the curfew. Once the order was given, the commander of one of Shadmi's battalions, Major Shmuel Malinki, who was in charge of the Border Guard unit at the village of Kafr Qasim, asked Shadmi on how to react to those villagers who were unaware of the curfew. Malinki later testified as follows: > '[Shadmi said] anyone who left his house would be shot. It would be best if > on the first night there were 'a few like that' and on the following nights > they would be more careful. I asked: in the light of that, I can understand > that a guerilla is to be killed but what about the fate of the Arab > civilians? And they may come back to the village in the evening from the > valley, from settlements or from the fields, and won't know about the curfew > in the village ‚Äì I suppose I am to have sentries at the approaches to the > village? To this Col. Issachar replied in crystal clear words, 'I don't want > sentimentality and I don't want arrests, there will be no arrests'. I said: > 'Even though?'. To that he answered me in Arabic, Allah Yarhamu, which I > understood as equivalent to the Hebrew phrase, 'Blessed be the true judge' > [said on receiving news of a person's death]'. Shadmi, however, denied that the matter of the returnees ever came up in his conversation with Malinki. Malinki issued a similar order to the reserve forces attached to his battalion, shortly before the curfew was enforced: \\"No inhabitants shall be allowed to leave his home during the curfew. Anyone leaving his home shall be shot; there shall be no arrests.\\" (ibid., p. 141) The new curfew regulations were imposed in the absence of the laborers, who were at work and unaware of the new rules.Idith Zertal, Israel's Holocaust and the Politics of Nationhood, Cambridge University Press, 2005 p. 172 At 4.30 p.m., the mukhtar (mayor) of Kafr Qasim was informed of the new time. He asked what would happen to the about 400 villagers working outside the village in the fields that were not aware of the new time. An officer assured him that they would be taken care of. When word of the curfew change was sent, most returned immediately, but others did not. Between 5 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., in nine separate shooting incidents, the platoon led by Lt. Gabriel Dahan that was stationed in Kafr Qasim all together killed nineteen men, six women, ten teenage boys (age 14‚Äì17), six girls (age 12‚Äì15), and seven young boys (age 8‚Äì13), who did not make it home before curfew. One survivor, Jamal Farij, recalls arriving at the entrance to the village in a truck with 28 passengers: > 'We talked to them. We asked if they wanted our identity cards. They didn't. > Suddenly one of them said, 'Cut them down' ‚Äì and they opened fire on us like > a flood.'Yoav Stern: 50 years after massacre, Kafr Qasem wants answers > (Ha'aretz, 30 October 2006) One Israeli soldier, Shalom Ofer, later admitted: 'We acted like Germans, automatically, we didn't think', but never expressed remorse or regret for his actions.Idith Zertal, Israel's Holocaust and the Politics of Nationhood,p. 172. The many injured were left unattended, and could not be succoured by their families because of the 24-hour curfew. The dead were collected and buried in a mass grave by Arabs, taken for that purpose, from the nearby village of Jaljuliya. When the curfew ended, the wounded were picked up from the streets and trucked to hospitals. No villagers in other villages under Shadmi's control were shot, because local commanders gave direct orders to disobey Shadmi's and Malinki's orders by holding fire. Also, among the platoons stationed in Kafr Qasim itself, only the one led by Dahan actually opened fire. Following events The military censor imposed a total ban on newspaper reportage on the massacre. Nonetheless news of the incident leaked out after communist Knesset Members Tawfik Toubi and Meir Vilner managed to enter the village two weeks later and investigate the rumours.Gadi Hitman, Israel and Its Arab Minority, 1948‚Äì2008: Dialogue, Protest, Violence, Rowman & Littlefield, 2016 pp. 70‚Äì71 However, it took two months of lobbying by them and the press before the government lifted the media blackout imposed by David Ben-Gurion. The government started an internal inquiry on November 1 involving, among others, the Criminal Investigations Division of the military police. To limit publicity, a military cordon was maintained around the village for months, preventing journalists from approaching.Robinson (2003), p. 400 David Ben-Gurion made his first public reference to the incident on November 12. Following public protests, eleven Border Police officers and soldiers involved in the massacre were charged with murder in a military court. The trial was presided over by Judge Benjamin Halevy. On October 16, 1958, eight of them were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms. Malinki received 17 and Dahan 15 years imprisonment. The court placed great emphasis on the fundamental responsibility of Shadmi, though the latter was not a defendant. Shadmi was subsequently charged as well, but his separate court hearing (February 29, 1959) found him innocent of murder and only guilty of extending the curfew without authority. His symbolic punishment, a fine of 10 prutot, i.e. a grush (one Israeli cent), became a standard metaphor in Israeli polemic debate.Robinson (2003), p. 411; Bilsky, p. 193. The fact that other local commanders realised they had to disobey Shadmi's order was cited by the court as one of the reasons for denying Dahan's claim that he had no choice. None of the officers served out the terms of their sentences. The court of appeal (April 3, 1959) reduced Malinki's sentence to 14 years and Dahan's to 10. The Chief of Staff further reduced them to 10 and 8 years, then the Israeli President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi pardoned many and reduced some sentences to 5 years each. Finally, the Committee for the Release of Prisoners ordered the remission of one third of the prison sentences, resulting in all the convicted persons being out of prison by November 1959.Lipmann (2001). Soon after his release, Malinki was promoted and put in charge of security for the top secret Negev Nuclear Research Center. In 1960, Dahan was placed in charge of \\"Arab Affairs\\" by the city of Ramla.Bilsky, p. 322 Legal impact The Kafr Qasim trial considered for the first time the issue of when Israeli security personnel are required to disobey illegal orders. The judges decided that soldiers do not have the obligation to examine each and every order in detail as to its legality, nor were they entitled to disobey orders merely on a subjective feeling that they might be illegal. On the other hand, some orders were manifestly illegal, and these must be disobeyed. Judge Benjamin Halevy's words, still much-quoted today, were that : The hallmark of manifest illegality is that it must wave like a black flag over the given order, a warning that says: \\"forbidden!\\" Not formal illegality, obscure or partially obscure, not illegality that can be discerned only by legal scholars, is important here, but rather, the clear and obvious violation of law .... Illegality that pierces the eye and revolts the heart, if the eye is not blind and the heart is not impenetrable or corrupt‚Äîthis is the measure of manifest illegality needed to override the soldier's duty to obey and to impose on him criminal liability for his action.\\"Bilsky (2004), p. 170. The incident was partly responsible for gradual changes in Israel's policy toward Arab citizens of Israel. By 1966, the military administration was abolished. Memorials On November 20, 1957, 400 distinguished guests and representatives from different sectors of Israeli society, including Knesset members, cabinet ministers, members from the then ruling Mapai party, national trade union officials, and notable members from neighboring Arab villages, held a reconciliation ceremony in memory of the victims at Kafr Qasim. The ceremony was designed as a \\"sulha\\", explicitly referring to a Bedouin clan-based conflict resolution custom. The government subsequently distributed reparations to the family of the victims. At that time, the mainstream press (such as JTA or Histadrut owned Davar) gives a favorable account of the ceremony,See for example: , unlike the Arabic-language press (such as al- Ittihad and al-Mirsad, sponsored by MAPAM and MAKI parties) who denounced it as a fraud. In a 2006 academic article focusing on the massacre's commemoration, Shira RobinsonShira Robinson is Assistant Professor of History and International Affairs at Georgetown University: considers the sulha as a \\"charade\\" which villagers were highly pressurized to participate in, designed to position the conflict \\"within a contrived history of symmetrical violence between Arabs and Jews,\\" staged by the government for the purpose of escaping its responsibilities and lightening the weight of the court's verdict, making the ceremony itself \\"part of the crime that Palestinians commemorate today.\\" In a 2008 academic article, Professor Susan SlyomovicsSusan Slyomovics is Professor of Anthropology and Near Eastern Languages & Cultures at UCLA. corroborates this perspective on a ceremony \\"forced upon the villagers.\\" In this paper, Slyomovics notably relies upon Ibrahim Sarsur's testimony, which concluded: \\"Until today in Kafr Qasim, there is no one who agrees with the manner of treatment of the government of Israel concerning the massacre and its consequences.\\" In October 2006, Yuli Tamir, the education minister in Israel, ordered schools around the country to observe the Kafr Qasim massacre and to reflect upon the need to disobey illegal orders. In December 2007, President of Israel Shimon Peres apologised for the massacre. During a reception in the village for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha, Peres said that he came to Kafr Qasem to ask the villagers for forgiveness. \\"A terrible event happened here in the past, and we are very sorry for it,\\" he said. The founder of the Islamic Movement in Israel, Sheikh Abdullah Nimr Darwish, also spoke at the ceremony and called on religious leaders on both sides to build bridges between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The townspeople of Kafr Qasim annually observe the massacre and several memorial monuments have been raised since 1976. According to Tamir Sorek, the Israeli government financially supported the first monument in 1976 in order to ensure sanitized non-political language. Therefore, the inscription on the first monument describes the massacre merely as a ‚Äúpainful tragedy‚Äù without mentioning who was responsible for it., p. 90-91 Later expressions of spatial commemoration have been much more explicit about this aspect. A museum dealing with the events was opened on October 29, 2006. On 26 October 2014 Reuven Rivlin, keeping an electoral promise, became the first sitting President of Israel to attend the annual commemorations for the fallen at Kfar Qasim. He called it an 'atrocious massacre', 'a terrible crime' that weighed heavily on the collective conscience of the State of Israel.'Rivlin condemns 'terrible crime' of Kfar Kassem massacre', The Times of Israel 26 October 2014.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4584353,00.html Ynet 26 October 2014]Barak Ravid, Jack Khoury,'Rivlin remembers 1956 Kafr Qasem massacre: A terrible crime was committed', Haaretz 26 October 2014. Operation Hafarferet Approximately 1/3 of the court hearings were held in secret, and the transcript has never been published. According to journalist Ruvik Rosenthal, the court received descriptions of a secret plan called Operation Hafarperet (\\"mole\\") to expel Israeli Arabs of the Little Triangle in case of a war with Jordan.. A similar opinion is held by historian Adam Raz, who described the massacre as pre-planned and part of an Operation which would result in the expulsion of the Arab Israelis from the region. Shadami described his trial as staged so as to \\"keep Israel‚Äôs security and political elite ‚Äì including Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan, and GOC Central Command (and later chief of staff) Tzvi Tzur ‚Äì from having to take responsibility for the massacre.\\" See also * Kafr kasem (1975 Syrian drama film) * List of massacres in Israel * Killings and massacres during the 1948 Palestine War * Qibya massacre * Sabra and Shatila massacre * Khan Yunis massacre * Rafah massacre External Links * Kafr Qasim documents from the Israeli archives ReferencesBibliography * Shira Robinson, Local struggle, national struggle: Palestinian responses to the Kafr Qasim massacre and its aftermath, 1956‚Äì66, International Journal of Middle East Studies, vol 35 (2003), 393‚Äì416.

The Kingdom of Prussia, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Russian Empire emerged as great powers, while the position of Austria, France, Spain, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire was weakened. As a result of the war, the Russian Empress, Catherine the Great, was in almost complete control of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Catherine was supported by the Prussian monarch, Frederick the Great, who hoped to eventually annex Polish provinces of Royal Prussia and Greater Poland. After the death of Augustus III of Poland, two dominant political camps of Poland expressed their interest in the Polish throne. The Potocki family promoted Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki, while the Czartoryski family backed its leader, Duke Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. Under pressure of Catherine, the Czartoryskis, however, withdrew candidacy of Adam Kazimierz, and replaced him with Stolnik from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, who had been one of Catherine‚Äôs lovers. Russian support however, did not mean that Poniatowski would automatically become new monarch of the Commonwealth. Polish‚ÄìLithuanian szlachta was at that time strongly anti-Russian, and in case of a free election, Branicki‚Äôs victory was secure. The Czartoryski family, fearing a civil war, asked the Russian Empress for military assistance. They were not aware of the fact that the Russians and their Prussian allies had previously signed a secret pact, which stipulated use of a military force to support Poniatowski. As early as October 17, 1763, Catherine wrote a letter to Frederick, in which she express the opinion that from all candidates to the Polish crown, Poniatowski was the least popular one, therefore, he would be most grateful to those who had made him the monarch. On April 11, 1764, Russia and Prussia signed the pact, in which both sides pledged to promote Poniatowski. He was the most convenient candidate for the Russians: as former lover of Catherine he would guarantee submission to his Russian sponsor. The Czartoryskis, who called themselves Familia, regarded themselves as patriots, who saw the need for urgent reforms of the declining Commonwealth. At the same time, they were of the opinion that all reforms were to be carried out with Russian permission only, as the Russian Empire was the dominant force in Central and Eastern Europe. Therefore, leaders of the Familia, Andrzej Zamoyski and August Aleksander Czartoryski urged Catherine to send Russian army. The Empress did so, issuing an announcement that wanted to protect all freedoms of the Commonwealth. The Potockis, who called themselves the Republicans, on the other hand, supported the notion of Golden Liberty, together with liberum veto. First clash between the two camps took place during the Convocation Sejm, which began on May 7, 1764. The Republicans vetoed all bills brought forward by the Czartoryskis. Russian army, stationed near Warsaw, intervened and ordered the Republicans to leave the Polish capital. Remaining Sejm deputies called a confederation, but failed to carry out any significant changes in the government of the Commonwealth. Poniatowski himself was an envoy to the Convocation Sejm, he represented the Land of Warsaw. The Election Sejm, which as usual took place in early September 1764 in Wola near Warsaw, was attended by some 5,000 nobles. Poniatowski, backed by Russian and Prussian envoys, as well as diplomats from England and Denmark, was unanimously elected on September 7. The election itself was affected by a large Russian military contingent, which was stationed around Warsaw. On September 13 Poniatowski signed the pacta conventa, in which he pledged to marry a Roman - Catholic. On November 25, 1764, following the order of Catherine the Great, Primate W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åubie≈Ñski crowned Poniatowski as King of Poland. The ceremony took place at St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw, and the new king, to dismay of conservatives, did not put on traditional Polish clothes, preferring to wear a 16th-century Spanish outfit. Poniatowski‚Äôs election was not at first recognized by several European states, such as France, Austria and Turkey, which saw the new monarch as Catherine‚Äôs tool. This changed after several interventions of Russian and Prussian diplomats.  Sources  * U. Augustyniak, Historia Polski 1572-1795, Warszawa 2008 * M.

He was the Deputy General Secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), one of Britain's largest trade unions, until May 2013. He has been the Chairman of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) since 2009, and in 2013 was named a vice chair of the group Unite Against Fascism (UAF). In the 2015 general election, Hugh was the Labour candidate for the Canterbury constituency, in Kent. Despite not winning the seat, he did increase the Labour vote share and came second in the election results. Lanning has played a major role in persuading trade unions in Britain to declare solidarity with the Palestinians and to support the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement. During his tenure at PCS, Lanning was active in the effort to keep people he considered 'fascists' or 'racists' out of the union and out of union workplaces. Lanning has given speeches at many labour and anti-racism rallies and has been a frequent contributor to the Morning Star, the daily newspaper of the Communist Party of Britain. Career Lanning worked for the civil service trade unions for over 30 years, starting with the Civil Service Union and all the subsequent merged unions.‚Äù As Deputy Chairman of PCS, the UK's largest civil service trade union, he served on the National Trade Union Committee, and was responsible for negotiations with the Cabinet Office on jobs, pensions, and personnel management issues. Lanning lost an election for General Secretary of PCS in 2000 to Mark Serwotka. His loss was widely described as unexpected. Lanning accepted the result and agreed to serve as Serwotka's deputy, but the incumbent General Secretary, Barry Reamsbottom, declared the result invalid and continued in office. 2009 Lanning was named chairman of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) in 2009. 2011 During a U.S. visit in 2011, Lanning was the keynote speaker at the ninth annual convention of Al- Awda, an organization allegedly linked to pro-terrorist groups. His speech was entitled ‚ÄúThe Role of Trade Unions and Solidarity Campaigns in the Struggle for the Liberation of Palestine.‚Äù 2013 Lanning resigned from his position with the PCS in May 2013. In 2013, Lanning was elected a vice chair of Unite Against Fascism (UAF). He was a speaker at UAF's national conference in March 2013. Andrew Gilligan, in a June 2013 article in the Telegraph, noted Lanning's position with Unite Against Fascism, and recounted that UAF members had climbed on London's main war memorial, ‚Äúsquashing...flowers that mourners had placed there, then trying to remove half of them altogether and 'jeering' other visitors as they paid their respects.‚Äù Refusal of entry to Israel In March 2017, days after the Knesset passed Amendment No. 28 to the Entry Into Israel Law, which allowed known supporters of the BDS movement to be banned from entering Israel, Lanning became the first British national to be refused entry to Israel under this law. After landing at Ben Gurion Airport, Lanning was detained and refused entry. He claimed he was interrogated for eight hours. He was subsequently put on a flight back to the UK and informed that he would need to apply for permission to enter Israel in the future. Book Lanning and Richard Norton-Taylor wrote a 1992 book, A Conflict of Loyalties: GCHQ 1984‚Äì1991, about 14 employees of the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) who refused to obey a new directive requiring that they resign from their unions.

Based in the San Francisco Bay area, he is involved with the International Solidarity Movement and was a founder of the Free Gaza Movement and the Free Palestine Movement. Early life and education Larudee was born in Iran to an Iranian Presbyterian minister and his American missionary spouse in 1946 and grew up in the American Midwest. He attended Georgetown University from 1970 to 1973 and received a Ph.D. in linguistics. He also graduated from the Niles Bryant School of Piano Technology in 1990. Career Larudee spent 14 years in Arab countries, supervising a Ford Foundation project in Lebanon, working as a Fulbright-Hays lecturer in Lebanon, and a United States government adviser to Saudi Arabia. Larudee has worked in the U.S. and abroad as a piano technician. He is certified as a Registered Piano Technician by the Piano Technicians Guild and has conducted training classes for the Guild and in overseas programs. He is the inventor of the patented Lo-Torq tuning pin, which is used for piano rebuilding. He has also compiled an English-Spanish glossary of piano terminology. He now runs the company Sharpe & Flatte Piano Service in El Cerrito, California. Views Larudee supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and opposes Jewish emigration to Israel. He has accused Israel of carrying out \\"pogroms\\" and committing \\"genocide\\" against Palestinians. He believes that Israel \\"confiscates\\" Palestinian land and turns Palestinian cities into \\"concentration camps.\\" He has also expressed sympathy for Palestinians who turn to terrorism. He defines \\"Palestine\\" as \\"Israel, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem.\\" He believes that the Palestinian issue is the \\"root\\" of many problems in the wider Middle East and even in the United States. At a 2009 fundraiser for Gaza, Larudee said that \\"Palestine will be freed in our lifetime\\" and that \\"We are all Palestinians ... What happened to Palestinians can happen to everyone.\\" Appearing on Iranian Press TV in December 2012, he said: > \\"Israel has never really cared about international law unless it is enforced > in some meaningful way; for example all it takes is for the United States to > threaten to cutback aid and all of a sudden Israel changes its actions > completely.\\" He criticized the U.S., saying that it in other parts of the world the United States' reaction to deplorable actions \\"is very strong\\" while \\"when Israel does the same things, there is this hypocritical action of doing nothing or even worse supporting and providing billions of dollars a year.\\" Asked about Israeli security, he replied that \\"Israel is one of the most powerful nations on the planet, its military security is not in question, so why are we so concerned about this? How about a little concern for reciprocal matters and standards such as the security of the Palestinians?\\" In response to the notion that Israel has a natural right to sovereignty and existence, Larudee has responded \\"I am sorry but there is no nation on earth that has the right to exist and this was articulated by Thomas Jefferson.... nations have risen and fallen and disappeared from the earth and will appear on the earth according to the necessity and requirements of their population. No nation on the earth has the right to exist, let us get rid of this myth.\\" Larudee has blamed U.S. aid to Israel for exacerbating Palestinian suffering. He supports lawfare. Larudee has said of Palestinian acts of violence against Israel: > \\"I do not see wild-eyed religious fanaticism as the reason for the attacks. > I see instead a resilient people without other means of resistance, pushed > to desperation by the increasing pressures of ethnic cleansing, while their > cries for help are ignored. Is there a proud people anywhere that might not > be driven to such measures to defend themselves?\\" Elsewhere, he has stated that he is opposed to suicide bombing. Activism=International Solidarity Movement Larudee is an active member and local leader of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), in which capacity he has acted as a human shield in the West Bank. He has also written training materials for new ISM members. He has been described as the head of ISM's northern California chapter. Beit Jala incident Larudee was one of about 100 individuals who visited refugee camps in the vicinity of Bethlehem and Nablus between March 29 and April 13, 2002, to protest and, in his words, to \\"check on the families...to see how they were\\". Larudee claimed to have been shot at and wounded at a camp in Beit Jala on April 1. In a CNN interview, he said that before visiting the families he and his colleagues had to ask the IDF forces at the camps for permission. \\"But their reaction was to simply fire at us\\". After the CNN interviewer noted that a report stated the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers had \\"fired at your feet,\\" Larudee acknowledged that the IDF had not fired at their bodies. He claimed, however, that shots had bounced off the stone walls and caused \\"several head injuries\\" in his group. In a June 2002 interview, he admitted that it was \\"possible in some cases I was protecting the wrong people\\". Eviction in Contra Costa County On March 17, 2011, Larudee was lawfully evicted by the Contra Costa County Sheriffs Department. During the eviction, he was warned that he would be arrested if he refused to cooperate. He refused, and was carried to a transportation vehicle. Larudee later described this as \\"torture\\". Free Gaza Movement Larudee is a co-founder of the Free Gaza Movement (FGM) (along with Greta Berlin, Mary Hughes Thompson, Sharyn Lock and Renee Bowyer), which was formed in fall 2006 to challenge the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip. Its first attempt to break the Israeli blockade took place in August 2008. FGM has asserted that its activities fall under the banner of \\"civil resistance\\" and \\"direct action\\" against Israel's \\"brutal siege\\" and its \\"collective punishment\\" of Gazans. FGM has conducted eight separate trips to Gaza, between August 2008 and July 2009. Larudee was one of the passengers on the Free Gaza Movement's first trip, on August 23‚Äì29, 2008. Fellow passengers included ISM co-founder Huwaida Arraf. The Free Gaza Movement was given funds by the Turkish IHH for its 2010 flotilla, which resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists and one American/Turkish activist on the MV Mavi Marmara during the Gaza flotilla raid. In 2008, Israel designated the IHH as a terror group, accusing it of funneling support to Hamas and other terrorist groups. A 2006 online blog report linked IHH to fundraising for jihadis headed to Bosnia, Chechnya, and Afghanistan. In a Seattle trial, IHH was described as playing a major role in the Al Qaeda Millennium bomb plot targeting Los Angeles International Airport. It has turned out that none of the accusations were verified, and IHH is one of the very few UN MGOs affiliated with the UN. That IHH was banned in Germany later turned out to be a mixup between the Turkish ƒ∞nsan Hak ve H√ºrriyetleri and the banned German Internationale Humanit√§re Hilfsorganisation e.V.. The U.S. government said it \\"cannot validate\\" any relationship or connection between ƒ∞HH and al-Qaida Gaza Freedom Flotilla Larudee was a member of the U.S. delegation aboard the 2010 Gaza Freedom Flotilla, which was attacked by Israeli forces on May 31, 2010. Larudee was on board the ship Sfendoni when the raid took place. He later said that he and his collaborators \\"locked arms to prevent the Israelis from coming in but they used electric tasers, stun grenades, and batons and they smashed the windows of the wheelhouse and then they tied us. When it got light, they had removed all the handcuffs. I spoke to some of my Greek friends and got an OK to jump into water. So I made sure that everybody could see me, because I wanted lots of witnesses, and when the Israeli started coming closer to me, I jumped. My goal was to delay the Israelis and spoil their plans, and encourage the others on the ship to resist\\". Larudee jumped into the water, later explaining that \\"I chose to resist by jumping overboard from the Sfendoni soon after we were captured, far out at sea. I took the calculated risk that Israel would find it hard to explain its failure to rescue me, and that the act might disrupt their operations to at least some extent\\". He also said later that \\"the Israeli military had to send out an extra boat and fish me out of the sea. Consider it the last form of protest we could resort to\\". After this, according to Larudee, the IDF subjected him to \\"multiple beatings in two days of captivity in Israel\\". He wrote that he \\"continued to protest by refusing to speak or walk, forcing my captors to carry me. Pain was used to force me to comply, and of course, when pain didn't work, they applied more pain, with the same result\\". In an interview he said that \\"I forced them to carry me everywhere. I wouldn't open my mouth for most of the time. They were very rough with me. They put my arm behind my back and twisted my joints. This was basically torture. I screamed, but I also told them that you can tear my arm out and it's not going to make me walk. So they ended up carrying me\\". All Israeli government officials and members of the military were exonerated by an internal inquiry into these events. Although Larudee said he practiced nonviolence during this entire episode, he said that \\"it's not necessarily for everyone\\" and expressed his admiration for those on the Mavi Marmara, another boat in the flotilla, who resisted the IDF violently. He also maintained that all of the flotilla's participants were unarmed. Gene St. Onge, who took part in the 2010 flotilla, later said that in response to the IDF's orders, Larudee had \\"resisted at every point. If they told Paul to sit, he'd stand. If they told him to stand, he'd sit\\". It was when soldiers started paying attention to another passenger, St. Onge continued, that Larudee jumped overboard. Larudee organized the 2011 Gaza Freedom Flotilla under the auspices of the Free Palestine Movement, but Greek authorities refused to let the ships leave port. According to Larudee, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cautioned the 2011 flotilla organizers against \\"creating a situation in which the Israelis have a right to defend themselves\\". Free Palestine Movement Larudee is a co-founder of the Free Palestine Movement, which achieved official recognition by the United Nations in 2011. Global March to Jerusalem Larudee was one of the organizers of the Global March to Jerusalem. He and the other organizers, Feroze Mithiborwala and Ali Mallah, wrote at the Huffington Post in March 2012 that \\"Israel is justifiably concerned about being treated as an international pariah\\" because \\"Israel has, in effect, put all its eggs in the American basket. American power is what allows Israel to receive deferential treatment in most European countries....Without U.S. diplomatic intervention, advocacy and arm-twisting, it is doubtful that any country in the world would defend Israel's policies\\". They added that the Greek government had \\"humiliated itself by preventing a peaceful flotilla of boats from leaving its shores for Gaza in 2011, for the sake of relations with Israel\\". And they concluded that the Global March to Jerusalem was \\"merely the latest and possibly the largest and most diverse expression\\" of swelling worldwide anti- Israeli sentiment. Problems with FBI Larudee has said that \\"In Paris or wherever I have a stopover, FBI agents usually approach me, asking where I've been and what I've been up to. I answer none of their questions expect [sic] those already answered in my passport\\". He says that FBI agents visited him twice. \\"They asked me six questions; I remember the first one: 'Is it true that you wrote on your website that you had been training volunteers?' But they didn't even name the website\\". Deported from Israel Larudee was arrested in and deported from Israel in 2006. Larudee was accused by Israeli authorities of being engaged in \\"anti-Israeli\\" activities that included meetings with Hamas a group accused by the United States of being a terrorism. Larudee had been photographed with Hamas leaders when he received an award after the first Gaza flotillas. He was traveling this time under the false identity Paul Wilder because he had been banned from the country before due to his association with Palestinian terrorist groups according to Lee Kaplan. Lee Kaplan from StoptheISM.com alerted the Israeli security before his trip. LaRudee tried to remain in Israel in a case that went to Israel's Supreme Court but Larudee claimed he was deported due to Kaplan's articles about him. \\"This is something small I can do to make life under occupation just a little more bearable for people, so I do it,\\" he said. But when he disembarked from his plane, Israeli authorities put him in a holding cell. When they ordered him back onto the plane to be deported, he refused to go and instead contacted an Israeli leftist human-rights attorney. Deportation from India Larudee was taken into custody in December 2012 in Tirur in the Malappuram district of India, where he had spoken at a Student Islamic Organisation conference. Charged with \\"violating visa norms,\\" he was issued a \\"quit India\\" notice, which required that he \\"leave India as early as possible\\". He was then blacklisted by police in Kerala, which means that he cannot enter India again. According to one report, Larudee was taken into custody and was sent back due to his violation of the visa condition that tourists are not allowed to deliver speeches to the public. Personal life Larudee lives with his Lebanese wife, Betty, in the San Francisco Bay Area. They are both Christians. They met in the 1970s at the U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia, where he was working at the time. \\"I would like to live in Lebanon,\\" he said in 2012, \\"but my wife likes to live in America. She says she would not mind to move here, but does not want to leave her children,\\" who at the time were 39 and 34 years old. Larudee is fluent in French, German, and Arabic.

It was founded in 1982 during the build-up to the first war between Israel and Lebanon, and was incorporated in the UK in 2004 as Palestine Solidarity Campaign Ltd. The PSC says it campaigns for peace and justice for Palestinians, in support of international law and human rights. The PSC's stated goals include the right of return for Palestinians and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. It has stated that it opposes both \\"Israel‚Äôs occupation and its aggression against neighbouring states\\". The PSC has criticised Israel's practices when arresting children. PSC states that it is \\"opposed to all forms of racism, including anti-Jewish prejudice and Islamophobia\\". Whilst recognising differences between apartheid- era South Africa and Israel, PSC promotes the boycotting of Israeli goods as a method that it believes was previously successful in achieving political change. PSC chapters have run workshops on such questions as \\"How to deal with Zionists' arguments; what to say to those who call us anti-Semitic\\" and \\"What are settlements? What will boycotting Israeli goods achieve?\\" Activities organised by and statements from the PSC are reported on outlets such as the website The Electronic Intifada.http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali- abunimah/israel-actions-surpassbarbarism-apartheid-south-africa-group-says- after-naeem Structure=Founders and leaders The PSC has an executive committee of 20 members, plus two members representing the PSC‚Äôs Trade Union Advisory Committee, who are elected at the Annual General Meeting by its members. Its current Chair is Hugh Lanning and its current Director is Ben Jamal. Based in London, there are four staff members while the organisation relies on volunteers to perform many tasks, such as running campaigns and managing branch offices. Most of PSC's directors have not been of Palestinian or Middle Eastern descent. One of its founders, Tony Greenstein, is also a founder of Jews for Boycotting Israeli Goods. Branches The PSC has about 40 branches in England, Scotland and Wales, listed on its website. The organisation's activity in Scotland is co-ordinated by the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign. The Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign is a separate organisation set up in late 2001 by established Irish human rights and community activists. Patrons The PSC website lists many patrons, including: Bob Crow and Tony Benn were also patrons of the organisation until they died. Trade union affiliates These include: *Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen ‚Äì ASLEF *Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union ‚Äì BECTU *Fire Brigades Union ‚Äì FBU *GMB (trade union) ‚Äì GMB *National Union of Teachers ‚Äì NUT *Public and Commercial Services Union ‚Äì PCS *National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers ‚Äì RMT *Transport Salaried Staffs' Association ‚Äì TSSA *Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians ‚Äì UCATT *University and College Union ‚Äì UCU *UNISON *UNITE Boycott Israeli goods campaign PSC has officially supported the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement since 2001. A study published in The Jewish Chronicle has been reported as recognising the PSC as one of the main proponents of the BDS movement in Britain. The PSC organised disruptions of a performance by the Israel Philharmonic at the Royal Albert Hall in February 2011. BBC Radio 3, which was broadcasting the concert live, was forced to suspend the broadcast several times due to the protesters' shouting and heckling. On 28 May 2012, when Israel's Habima theatre company performed at the London Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, the PSC and other BDS groups organised a protest outside the building. On 29 May 2012, BBC Radio 4 reported that Habima was \\"being criticised for performing to Jewish audiences in the Occupied Territories.\\" A PSC press release corrected the report, saying that it was criticising Habima \\"for performing in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\\" After six months of pressure by PSC, the BBC Trust upheld the PSC's complaint. The PSC waged a two-year campaign to block an EU trade agreement, the ACAA, that recognised Israeli pharmaceutical standards as equal to those in Europe. The agreement was ultimately passed in October 2012. In November 2012, the PSC uploaded a 69-minute film to YouTube entitled The Case for Cultural & Academic Boycott of Israel, introduced by Ken Loach. PSC has supported the BDS campaign against the French company Veolia. Veolia has been criticised by the BDS movement because of its activities in Palestine and Israel. The allegations made included providing infrastructure and services to illegal settlements and racist recruitment policies. The PSC led a campaign to block the Israeli government's tourism bureau from advertising in British newspapers, its argument being that Israel was misrepresenting Palestinian territories as its own.

It describes itself as not-for-profit, independent and providing a Palestinian perspective. EI was founded by Ali Abunimah, the Palestinian-American son of Jordan's UN ambassador, and Arjan El Fassed, a former Dutch politician. History EI was founded in February 2001About The Electronic Intifada by Ali Abunimah, an American citizen of Palestinian descent; Arjan El Fassed, human rights activist based in the Netherlands; Laurie King, an anthropologist and former coordinator of the International Campaign for Justice for the Victims of Sabra and Shatila and the managing editor of the Journal of Palestine Studies in Washington; and Nigel Parry, currently an eclectic Internet consultant, writer and musician based in Pittsburgh. According to their website, The Electronic Intifada is mainly funded by its readers, with additional funds provided by private foundations. It does not receive funds from governments or political parties. In 2010 it received US$130,000 in donations from individuals and US$83,000 from private foundations. In April 2008, The Electronic Intifada released an article that documented e-mails sent between members of the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA). The stated purpose of the group was \\"help[ing] us keep Israel-related entries on Wikipedia from becoming tainted by anti-Israel editors\\".Damien, McElroy. \\"Israeli battles rage on Wikipedia\\" The Telegraph, 7 May 2008 Five Wikipedia editors involved in a CAMERA campaign were sanctioned by Wikipedia administrators, who wrote that the project's open nature \\"is fundamentally incompatible with the creation of a private group to surreptitiously coordinate editing by ideologically like-minded individuals\\". Reception=In Israel Hannah Brown of The Jerusalem Post calls EI \\"one of the most elaborate\\" sites of those that give a \\"Palestinian perspective of the news\\", going on to describe EI as \\"very professional, user-friendly and well written,\\" and added that it \\"is adorned by photos, such as a picture of a lone, small Palestinian boy aiming a stone at an Israeli tank.\\"Hannah Brown, \\"Virtual war\\", The Jerusalem Post, 27 September 2002 Gil Sedan, a Jewish Telegraphic Agency reporter, described EI as a \\"cyberpropaganda\\" site which \\"may contribute to a better understanding of the Palestinian cause,\\" but also said that it \\"is too biased to be of much use to mainstream publications.\\"Gil Sedan, \\"Mideast cease-fire doesn't extend into cyberspace\\", 29 June 2001 Other Political journalist and editor of the online newsletter CounterPunch Alexander Cockburn stated \\"there are a number of excellent news outlets for those who want unjaundiced reporting. ... The Electronic Intifada ... is trusted.\\" NRC Handelsblad, a Dutch major mainstream newspaper, recommended The Electronic Intifada to its readers in 2006 at the height of the war on Lebanon. NRC wrote, \\"The Electronic Intifada (EI), a news site in English, reports from a Palestinian perspective, but as impartial as possible. EI is often faster than the established media.\\" Conflict with NGO Monitor over Dutch funding In 2010, the Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor criticized the Dutch Interchurch Organisation for Development Cooperation (ICCO) for providing financial support to The Electronic Intifada, which it said was antisemitic and compared Israeli policies with those of the Nazi regime. Gerald M. Steinberg, head of the organization, described The Electronic Intifada as \\"an explicitly pro- Palestinian political and ideological Web site\\"\\"Human Rights Watch needs watching\\", Gerald M. Steinberg, The Jewish Week, 25 March 2005 that hosts \\"anti-Israel propaganda.\\"\\"Ken Roth's blood libel, Jerusalem Post, 26 August 2006 Marinus Verweij, chairman of ICCO‚Äôs executive board said \\"The EI reports frequently about the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the State of Israel. In no way is the EI anti-Israel or anti-Semitic.\\" He described The Electronic Intifada as \\"an important source of information from the occupied Palestinian territories\\" frequently used by newspapers such as The Washington Post and the Financial Times. Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman Ward Bezemer stated that whether ICCO had promoted anti-semitism, a criminal offence, is to be determined by the Public Prosecutor on the basis of Dutch law. On 26 November 2010, Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal, who is Jewish and has an Israeli wife, said: \\"I will look into the matter personally. If it appears that the government subsidized NGO ICCO does fund The Electronic Intifada, it will have a serious problem with me.\\" Rosenthal later told IKON radio that \\"anti-semitism is not the issue\\" but \\"my concern about calls to contribute to boycotts and embargoes\\". The Electronic Intifada responded to NGO Monitor's statements regarding ICCO's financial support. The Electronic Intifada wrote: \\"NGO Monitor is an extreme right-wing group with close ties to the Israeli government, military, West Bank settlers, a man convicted of misleading the US Congress, and to notoriously Islamophobic individuals and organizations in the United States.\\" EI co-founder MP Arjan El-Fassed, who also wrote for the website Al-Awda, told the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant that the fuss created by NGO Monitor was related to one quote from an interview with Jewish Holocaust survivor and anti-Zionist Hajo Meyer in June 2009. Meyer told EI: 'I can write up an endless list of similarities between Nazi Germany and Israel.' In the same article, the Director of the Centre for Information and Documentation Israel (CIDI), Ronnie Naftaniel, asserted that The Electronic Intifada is not an anti-Semitic website. He did, however, state that, while everybody should be free to express their opinion, the Dutch government should not indirectly fund a website that regularly calls for a boycott of Israel. On 14 January 2011, ICCO decided not to change its policy after a discussion held with the Dutch foreign minister. In response to ICCO's decision, The Jerusalem Post reports that Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal \\"will monitor ICCO‚Äôs activities. He will consider this as a minus when he makes up the balance when ICCO applies again in a new subsidies round,\\" as said by Ward Bezemer, a spokesman for Rosenthal.\\" Partos, a national umbrella for more than a hundred Dutch civil society organizations in the international development cooperation sector, strongly condemned Rosenthal's threats to ICCO's funding. \\"Rosenthal's position vis-√†-vis ICCO creates a dangerous precedent for the future. Development organisations will have to continue to fight for an independent voice in the debate. Partos will ... [fight] for that.\\" In April 2011, Professor of International Cooperation Studies Paul Hoebink argued that Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal has no say in Dutch government funding to ICCO because Minister Ben Knapen holds the portfolio. In addition, ICCO's contribution to The Electronic Intifada is paid with ICCO's own funds. Professor of International Law and Dutch politicians for the Labour Party, Nico Schrijver considered Rosenthal's threat to cut government funding if ICCO continues its financial support to The Electronic Intifada as very worrying.

Though deeply interested in Agastya, Nithya is shocked to learn about his dark past in Mughor, a region ruled by blood ridden underworld. His old promise to his friend Baala (Thilak Shekar) had pushed Agastya to enter criminal underworld. Within years he had managed to capture the entire region for Baala, against all odds; earning himself a fearful respect. Ultimately, Agastya's skirmish with Baala's younger brother had led to his death. Agastya had forced an exile upon himself, respecting his mother's (Padmaja Rao) vow, to live a life free of any violence. After murdering his father, deeming him weak, Dheeraj manages to capture Nithya and relocates her to Mughor, forcing Agastya to return.He faces the entire criminal fraternity of Mughor, kills Dheeraj and saves Nithya.

Soundtrack  The music for the film and soundtracks were composed by Ravi Basrur with lyrics written by Ram Narayan, S. Sarvesh and Basrur. The soundtrack has six songs.  Reception  Reviewing the soundtrack album, Kavya Christopher of The Times of India wrote, \\"Apart from the title track ‚Äì Ugramm Veeram ‚Äì which rightfully captures the essence of the title, translating to aggression, the rest of the numbers take you into a romantic journey of dream sequences that many stories try to rely on to bring in some breathing space in an otherwise adrenaline-packed plot.\\"  Marketing and release  The trailer of the film was released on YouTube on 25 November 2013 and received positive responses from filmgoers and impressed a section of the Kannada film fraternity. Srimurali promoted the film in various shopping malls and places such as Tumkur, Gulbarga, Belgaum and other towns. He also uploaded pictures with his fans on a regular basis on social networking sites. The film made its theatrical release on 21 February 2014 in 142 theaters across Karnataka.

His dear friend Darshan (Challenging star) helped Sri Murali during release as director Prashant Neel met with a major accident while traveling from Chennai  Reception  Upon its theatrical release, Ugramm received positive reviews from critics who praised the performances, the screenplay, the cinematography and the direction. B. S. Srivani of Deccan Herald wrote of the film, \\"The screenplay is a beauty .. and dialogues .. do their job very well.\\" and concluded writing, \\"An overdose of violence to simple-minded families, Ugramm, however, is a treat for those looking for instant kicks.\\" A. Sharadhaa of The New Indian Express wrote, \\"This is a landmark gangster film that balances commercial elements with a stirring screenplay.\\" and concluded writing, \\" A very well-made film, Ugramm is full of action, drama and fleshed out characters.\\" Shyam Prasad S. of Bangalore Mirror gave the film a rating out 3/5 and wrote, \\"The film is technically brilliant, but what it lacks is a style to the excessive energy that is drummed up.\\"  Box-office  Ugramm opened strongly at the box-office and collected 50 crore in Karnataka after its release.

The glacial and interglacial periods are linked to regular eccentricities in the Earth‚Äôs orbit and correspond to approximately 100 kyr cycles. The advancing, or glacial periods can cause a massive displacement of flora and fauna as it drives them away from the poles, with the most recent glacial maximum having occurred about 20,000 years ago.,Hewitt, Godfrey M. ‚ÄúSome genetic consequences of ice ages, and their role in divergence and speciation.‚Äù Biological Journal of the Linnean society. No. 58, 1996. (247-276) Ceridwen et al. ‚ÄúPoleward Bound: biological impacts of southern Hemisphere glaciation.‚Äù Trends in Ecology and Evolution. Vol. 27, No. 8, August 2012. (462-471) Refugia While most of the biota were driven away from the poles during the glacial advance, there were still isolated areas of sanctuary. These locations are referred to as refugia. A refugium is defined by Ceridwen et al. as a ‚Äúgeographical area in which populations of glacially impacted organisms persisted during the LGM (Last Glacial Maximum).‚Äù Some different types of these areas are coastal, embedded, and periglacial refugia. Coastal refugia are locations of refuge located on uncovered coastal regions or islands. Due to a lower sea level during the last glacial period, it is suspected that the exposed continental shelf played a large role in acting as a refugium to many different organisms as well as potential route for migration.Carrara, P.E., et al. ‚ÄúPossible refugia in the Alexander Archipelago of southeastern Alaska during the late Wisconsin glaciation.‚Äù Can. J. Earth Sci. 44: 229-244 (2007) Periglacial refers to refugia located adjacent to a glacier or an ice sheet. Embedded refugia are areas that remained uncovered within the limit of the glacial advance (hot springs or nunataks). Effects of ice age on Northern and Southern Hemispheres In the northern hemisphere, the last glacial maximum reached about 40Àö N in North America, covering the Great Lakes. In Scandinavia, it extended down to about 52Àö N, affecting parts of Britain and the northern regions of Europe. The majority of the ice coverage was over land, allowing for major retreat during glacial periods. There are some areas on the west coast of Alaska and British Columbia that are projected as coastal refugia for organisms. There is also a potential refugium in the far north of Scandinavia on the island of And√∏ya. In the southern hemisphere, the majority of the ice coverage was over the ocean with some glaciation present on South America and New Zealand. While this glaciation wasn‚Äôt as extensive as that of the northern latitudes, the climate was still affected. As a result of the glacial advance, biota retreated north to warmer regions and east over the Andes to avoid the Patagonian ice sheet. Also, many mobile marine fauna migrated north to some of the surrounding islands, out of reach of the oceanic ice sheet. In addition to periglacial and coastal refugia, there were also possible areas of embedded refugia in Patagonia and New Zealand. Southern Hemisphere=South America As the LGM ice sheet crept along the west coast of South America, it drove the previous inhabitants north and east. The northern traveling flora and fauna established in the warmer, coastal regions of Chile, out of reach of the ice that stretched up to 40Àö S latitude. Those that moved east jumped the Andes and established themselves in periglacial refugia on the eastern slopes, or further down in the more low-lying areas of Argentina that remained unaffected by the ice retreat. Additionally, there were areas of embedded refugia that may have allowed for habitation by freshwater crabs, fish, and even otters. The freshwater crabs (Aegla alacalufi) were suspected to have survived in hot springs, which may have kept the ice from forming in that area. The fish, Galaxias platei, were thought to have survived not only in eastern refugia over the Andes, but also in isolated proglacial lakes in the northernmost portions of Patagonia. This was inferred by the genetic lineages suggesting a larger group to the east of the Andes and smaller more isolated groups to the west of the Andes during the LGM.Zemlak, T.S. et al. ‚ÄúAcross the Southern Andes on fin: glacial refugia, drainage reversals and a secondary contact zone revealed by the phylogeographical signal of Galaxias platei in Patagonia. Mol. Ecol. 17, 5049-5061. As good food sources for the Patagonian otter (Lontra provocax), the Galaxias platei and the Aegla alacalufi may have played a part in sustaining this aquatic mammal during this glacial period. Today, this otter is found throughout Southern Argentina and Chile and is found as far north as 39ÀöS. During the LGM, most of its habitat was covered by ice. DNA testing of L. provocax in the Patagonian area has shown potential embedded refugia in the southern coastal region, with intertidal crustaceans in addition to other embedded aquatic life as possible food sources.Vianna,J. A., et al. ‚ÄúPhylogeography of the Patagonian otter Lontra provocax: adaptive divergence to marine habitat or signature of southern glacial refugia? BMC Evol. Biol. 11, 53 New Zealand Evidence of a possible refugium for forest habitat was found in the northern, glacially-affected Howard Valley, situated on the South Island of New Zealand. This location consists of high peaks and deep U-shaped valleys. Today it is characterized by grassland valley floor and forested slopes. Glacial advances in this area occurred around 28000, 21500, and 19000 years BP (before present).Marra, Maureen J., et al. ‚ÄúGlacial forest refugium in Howard Valley, South Island, New Zealand.‚Äù Journal of Quaternary Science (2010) 25(3). (309-319) The deep valleys found in this location may have acted as microclimates that sheltered the trees from glacial conditions and climate. Pollen studies show that these valleys consisted mostly of grasses and shrubs around 25,000‚Äì22,000 years BP. A low occurrence of beech (Nothofagus menziesii) pollen (dated to 25,742‚Äì22,988 years BP) suggests a refugium in this area. Another line of evidence was found in the fossilized remains of ground beetles dating back to 25,742‚Äì22,988 years BP. Because these beetles are normally associated with tree line habitats, their location suggests an altitudinal tree limit during the glacial period. Based on these lines of evidence, beech forest may have been more common in lower elevation areas of the Howard Valley during periods of glacial advance. Sub-Antarctic island refugia The many islands surrounding Antarctica may have played large roles in the survival of marine life during the LGM. With the extent of the ice sheet from the coasts of the Antarctic continent, only the most mobile of fauna were able to retreat north. In the case of petrels and other flying seabirds, the ability to nest on nunataks may have allowed them the ability to stay on the continent during the glacial period and fly down to the edge of the ice for food. However, this was most likely not the case with colony forming species such as the Ad√©lie penguin and the Antarctic elephant seal. The Antarctic elephant seal was likely a resident of the Antarctic continent (Victoria Land) 7,500‚Äì8,000 years ago. However, an advance of ice 1000 years ago drove them away to the more northern Macquarie Island. With evidence of such a large migration route, Macquarie and other similar islands likely acted as refugia for elephant seals as well as other marine life during the LGM as they moved to areas unaffected by the ice. An example of this is the Ad√©lie penguin, which is widespread on the islands surrounding Antarctica. Genetic evidence suggests that the modern Ad√©lie penguin has stemmed from two different lineages. This postulates two island refugia during the LGM. Northern Hemisphere=Alexander Archipelago The islands of the Alexander Archipelago make up a large part of Alaska‚Äôs panhandle. It is host to over 2000 islands, some with mountains exceeding 1000 meters in elevation. These higher peaks still support remnants of the ice age: snowfields and small glaciers. During the glacial period, glacier formation was accompanied by a lowering in the sea level, which likely helped expose the now submerged continental shelf. While the majority of the Archipelago was covered in ice, these outer coast areas where continental shelf was exposed were very likely coastal refugia for a variety of plants and animals. Examples of these spots include Baranof Island, which has a lack of glacial evidence on its southern end, suggesting lack of coverage during the LGM. Also, Coronation Island seems to have relatively minor glaciation. In support of possible refugia, a brown bear skeleton was found on Coronation dating back to 11630 years BP. This may show that there was a refugium nearby that this bear could have traveled from. It may also indicate that Coronation was a refugium that provided a food source for the bear. On both of the outer islands, Baranof and Coronation, there are high levels of endemic mammalian species. This is true of Chichagof, Forrester, and Warren islands as well; all three of which help make up the furthest extent of the Alexander Archipelago. These regions of endemism have been interpreted as possible coastal refugia. An example of this endemism is found when looking at brown bears in the Alexander Archipelago. These bears exhibit a lower genetic diversity than bears found inland. Additionally, genetic tests have shown them to be more closely related to present-day polar bears than mainland bears. This evidence suggests that they may have inhabited the Archipelago for at least 40,000 years, with habitable refugia existent throughout this time. Another species that might have made use of refugia during this time is the Chum salmon. It appears that the different groups of salmon that spawn on the Prince of Wales Island are more similar to one another than they are to salmon elsewhere in SE Alaska. This has been interpreted as meaning that Prince of Wales Island is the source of present-day Chum salmon, whose Wisconsin Glaciation may have been spent living in streams on the exposed continental shelf. There has also been possible evidence of flora in refugia. Analysis of pollen deposits on Pleasant Island, near Glacier Bay, dates the arrival of shore pine and mountain hemlock to about 11900 years ago. Because of the early arrival to the area, and also shared genetic information found almost exclusively in trees of this region, it is suggested that nearby coastal refugia were the source of this pollen. The exposed continental shelf during the LGM seems to have played a big part in supplying glacier refugia. That being said, the extent of the exposure is not well known. The evidence needed to show the composition and scope of these once exposed shelves is now deep underwater. A lack of information is due in part to the remoteness of the outer coast in addition to a lack of sea-floor imagery. Queen Charlotte Islands A study of endemic ground-beetle population on the Queen Charlotte Islands has given possible evidence for refugia in this region. The ground-beetle, or Carabid beetle, is an insect found worldwide. These beetles are oftentimes conspicuous and abundant, making them easy to collect, prepare, and study. The majority of carabids are found in cool- to cold-temperate zones, and almost half of its 20,000 identified species have been found in Canada and Alaska alone.Kavanaugh, David H. ‚ÄúThe Ground-Beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) fauna of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Its composition, affinities, and origins.‚Äù The Outer Shores. 1984 (131-146) There were three identified endemic species of carabid beetle found on the Queen Charlotte Islands. All three of these species were found to exhibit brachyptery, which is the reduction of the beetles‚Äô wings. Brachyptery was found to occur in areas of long-term occupation such as refugia, where wing- reduction allowed for the redirection of energy for travel towards other uses such as reproduction. Another finding was that between these three endemic species, they had two preferred habitats: high alpine zones and rocky beaches. These three species would have been well suited to refugia during the LGM as the continental shelf was exposed and some mountain peaks stuck out from the top of the ice sheet. Europe During the LGM, many of the species of Europe retreated south, out of reach of the ice sheet and the colder climate. These southern refugia have been shown in looking at the pathways of the common European meadow grasshopper. Through analysis of the grasshoppers‚Äô genome it was found that they had been divided into 5 different geographical regions: Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, and the Balkans.Hewit, Godfrey. ‚ÄúThe genetic legacy of the Quaternary ice ages.‚Äù Nature, vol. 405, 22 June 2000. (907-913) Despite significant differences in the ecology of species, some general colonization patterns are observed which are often common to several species groups.Hewitt, Godfrey. \\"Post‚Äêglacial re‚Äêcolonization of European biota.\\" Biological journal of the Linnean Society, 68, 87-112, 1999 These colonization entailed successive bottlenecks phenomena that led to a loss of genetic diversity in northern populations.Bennett, K. et al. \\"Quaternary refugia of north European trees.\\" Journal of Biogeography, 18, 103-115, 1991 Therefore, based on the data of numerous phylogeographic research, the high genetic diversity of populations of southern regions can often be an indication for positioning a Pleistocene refugium, while the geographical distributions of the northern populations are dictated by the colonization patterns of the refugia populations.Taberlet, P. et al. \\"Comparative phylogeography and postglacial colonization routes in Europe.\\" Molecular Ecology, 7, 453‚Äì464, 1998 While these southern refugia have been found for many other species of flora and fauna, there may have been high altitude refugia on the coast of northern Norway. One proposed refugium is on the island of And√∏ya in Norway. Pollen and chloroplast DNA of spruce and pine, found in the sedimentary deposits on this island, were dated to about 22,000 years BP for the spruce and about 17,700 years BP for the pine.Parducci, Laura, et al. ‚ÄúGlacial Survival of Boreal Trees in Northern Scandinavia.‚Äù Science, vol. 335, no. 6072. 2 March 2012. (1083-1086) This would put the pine in this region at a time when the ice sheet was just beginning to retreat, and would place the spruce in the area shortly after. When comparing this information to the geographical and climatic history of this region, the data seems questionable. As the ice retreated about 22,000 years ago, it resulted in the submergence of large parts of the coastline in water. The study site in And√∏ya was underwater until about 18,000 years BP, making habitation of spruce unlikely. Furthermore, this regions present climate does not support spruce and is not ideal for pine. Because this region was likely harsher during the glacial period, it is doubtful that an already ill-equipped species would have been able to establish let alone survive. A possible explanation for the debatable dates obtained from the pollen and chloroplast samples is measurement device contamination.Birks, Hilary H., et al. ‚ÄúComment on ‚ÄòGlacial survival of boreal trees in Northern Scandinavia.‚Äô‚Äù Science, vol. 338, no. 6108. 9 November 2012.

(KVC) is a private, nonprofit child welfare and behavioral healthcare organization. When Kansas became the first U.S. state to privatize its child welfare services in 1996, it selected KVC to be one of the service providers. As of 2018, KVC Kansas remains the only original contractor that is still providing these services. KVC has provided foster care case management services longer than any other private organization in the U.S. Since its founding in 1970, KVC has grown since from a single home for at-risk boys in Kansas to a national organization serving 60,000 children and families in the United States. KVC uses evidence-based research to achieve better outcomes and advance child welfare.  History  What is now KVC Health Systems started in 1970 as Wyandotte House in Wyandotte County, Kansas. B. Wayne Sims was hired in 1980 as President and CEO. He contributed some of the organization's guiding philosophies including, ‚ÄúWhat would you want for your child?‚Äù and ‚ÄúThere is no magic answer down the street.\\" He retired at the end of 2015, completing 35 years as KVC's President and CEO. The current CEO is Jason Hooper. When the state of Kansas became the first state to privatize child welfare services in 1996, KVC was selected as one of the contractors. In 2018, KVC remains the only original contractor in the state. On July 1, 2013, the Kansas Department of Children and Families awarded KVC an expanded contract, making KVC responsible for children needing foster care in 30 counties of eastern Kansas. These services are provided through subsidiary KVC Kansas, also known as KVC Behavioral HealthCare. An August 2013 visit to Kansas by a delegation from Singapore's government attests to KVC's success in improving outcomes for vulnerable children.  Overview  KVC provides services for children and families including foster care, adoption, in-home family therapy / family preservation services, behavioral healthcare, outpatient services and residential psychiatric hospital care for children and adolescents. The organization has been accredited by The Joint Commission since 1991. KVC Health Systems is the parent organization of subsidiaries including: *KVC Kansas (also known as KVC Behavioral HealthCare) *KVC Hospitals that includes KVC Prairie Ridge Hospital, KVC Wheatland Hospital and Niles (also known as Niles Home for Children) *KVC Nebraska (also known as KVC Behavioral HealthCare Nebraska) *KVC West Virginia (also known as KVC Behavioral HealthCare West Virginia) *KVC Kentucky (also known as KVC Behavioral HealthCare Kentucky) State and federal agencies as well as international governments often call on KVC Health Systems to provide consulting on how to improve child welfare.  Partnerships  Dr. Glenn Saxe, director of The Child Study Center at New York University's Langone Medical Center, has worked with KVC to adapt his Trauma Systems Therapy (TST) approach to the foster care community. This aims to equip foster parents to better support children who have experienced trauma such as abuse or neglect. KVC Health Systems partnered with the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Child Trends, and the Child Study Center at New York University to conduct a five-year study of integrating trauma-informed care into the child welfare system. The study found that the implementation of TST throughout the entire agency was successful and created positive results for children. Children exposed to TST showed measurable improvements in functioning, behavior regulation and placement stability (which means not moving from foster family to foster family). Within the first three months of exposure to trauma-informed care, children also showed improvements in emotional regulation. Finally, staff reported higher levels of effectiveness with children based on concerted care using an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach grounded in a common language and shared interventions. Sesame Street in Communities has partnered with KVC Health Systems to help bring resources to children and families in the Kansas City, KS area. This partnership will allow for KVC to train our employees and share with the families we serve on how to best help children deal with difficult topics like grief, traumatic experiences and others.

It is hypothesized to be a possible pre- Pleistocene, extraterrestrial impact structure. It lies underwater at a depth of . This underwater feature was found during the study of high-resolution bathymetric and sub-bottom profiler data collected south of the city of Sept- Iles in the northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.Lajeunesse, P., St‚ÄêOnge, G., Locat, J., Duchesne, M.J., Higgins, M.D., Sanfa√ßon, R. and Ortiz, J., 2013.

The Corossol Structure: a glaciated crater of possible impact origin in the northwestern Gulf of St Lawrence, eastern Canada. In Dowdeswell, J. A., Canals, M., Jakobsson, M., Todd, B. J., Dowdeswell, E. K. & Hogan, K. A. (eds) 2016. Atlas of Submarine Glacial Landforms: Modern, Quaternary and Ancient. Geological Society, London, Memoirs, 46(1), pp.127‚Äì128.  Geology  The Corossol structure has a maximum diameter of and rises above the surrounding sea floor. At its centre, there is central uplift is in diameter and rises to the same elevation as the crater rim to a depth of about below the surface of the Gulf of St Lawrence. This uplift lies within a in diameter and deep circular central cavity. The central cavity is surrounded by a wide brim. In addition, three concentric rings form narrow ( wide), shallow, and discontinuous depressions around the central cavity. The central uplift, associated central cavity, brim, and rings likely represent both deformation and differential erosion of sedimentary rocks of the Ordovician Saint. Lawrence Platform. The sedimentary strata surrounding the Corossol structure show no deformation. However, seismic data reveal that they are highly fractured by a series of deep faults. These faults also are associated with the concentric rings and form the irregular topography of the structure's brim. Less than of Quaternary sediments partially fill the central cavity. These sediments consist of glaciomarine and postglacial sediments. The central cavity and its sediment fill are interrupted by two diagonal high bedrock ridges that connect the brim to the central peak. Using high-resolution seismic, it was found that the bedrock is locally covered with a thin veneer of glacial till overlain by of glaciomarine and postglacial sediments. The discontinuous nature of the rings results from either partial burial of the rings under these sediments or partial erosion of the rings.  Geomorphology  The gulf bottom surrounding the Corossol structure is characterized by a relict cuesta landscape consisting of partially eroded, gently inclined sedimentary rock layers that decreases southwards into a flat topography. The cuestas consist of steep northward-facing scarps and gentle southward-dipping slopes. Along its north side, the crater is truncated by a steep scarp of one of these cuestas and a wide and deep basin. Distinct long and wide streamlined glacial lineations cut across the southern half of the Corossol structure. The cuestas and associated paleovalleys likely were created by fluvial erosion during regional sea-level lowstand(s) that likely predates Quaternary glaciations.Lajeunesse, P., 2014. Buried preglacial fluvial gorges and valleys preserved through Quaternary glaciations beneath the eastern Laurentide Ice Sheet. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 126(3‚Äì4), pp. 447‚Äì458.Loring, D.H. & Nota, D.J.G. 1973. Morphology and sediments of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Bulletin of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada, 182, pp. 1‚Äì147. The passage of the Laurentide Ice Sheet formed the streamlined glacial lineations that cut across the southern half of the Corossol structure. The orientation of these lineations indicate SE‚ÄìSSE-directed ice flow that scoured the surface of the Corossol structure.  Origin  It is proposed that the Corossol structure was created as a result of the impact of a meteorite of about 300 metres (980 ft) in diameter. The impact origin of the Corossol structure is indicated by its associated geology, faulting, fracturing, and a rock fragment recovered from the crater surface. This rock fragment exhibits, under the microscope, impact melt and shock-induced structures.Higgins, M.D., P. Lajeunesse, G. St- Onge, R. Sanfacon, and M. Duchesne, 2013, Impact Breccia Clast from the Corossol Crater, Canada. 76th Annual Meteoritical Society Meeting. Meteoritics and Planetary Science Supplement. id.5190.  Age  The precise, absolute age of the Corossol structure remains undetermined. It geological setting and cross-cutting relationships indicate that it was created long after the Middle Ordovician (470 million years ago) and before the accumulation of glacial till and creation of streamlined lineations, which are interpreted as subglacially produced mega-scale glacial lineations, on its surface. The relict cuestas and evidence of fluvial erosion observed on the outer walls of the structure, imply it was formed during one of the periods of regional lowstand of sea level prior to the Quaternary glaciations. In 2013, it was stated that the Corossol structure is related to a proposed impact event that is hypothesized to have taken place at the start of the Younger Dryas Episode and it supports the hypothesis that a meteorite impact triggered this cooling episode.Wu, Y., Sharma, M., LeCompte, M.A., Demitroff, M.N. and Landis, J.D., 2013. Origin and provenance of spherules and magnetic grains at the Younger Dryas boundary. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(38), pp.E3557-E3566. A later paper argues that their interpretation is based on the misreading of preliminary results, including a radiocarbon date, published in a conference abstract.Higgins, M.D., Lajeunesse, P., St-Onge, G., Locat, J., Duchesne, M., Ortiz, J. and Sanfacon, R., 2011, Bathymetric and petrological evidence for a young (Pleistocene?) 4-km diameter impact crater in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Canada. In Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (Vol. 42, p. 1504). Later papers conclude on the basis of regional studies and the presence of till and glacial lineations cutting across the Corossol structure that the radiocarbon date only indicates that it was formed before deglaciation, which occurred approximately 12.7 and 12.4 cal. ka BP. Furthermore, the conference abstract did not take into account the fluvial erosion of the cuestas which support a Pre-Quaternary, possibly Paleogene or older, age for the Corossol structure. As a result, it was concluded that this structure has never been \\"provisionally dated to 12.9 cal. ka BP\\" as stated in 2013.

Tolley and R. Young. McGill-Queen's University Press. . According to the CCR, refugee services should focus on mental health.  History  In 1978, known at the time as the Standing Conference of Canadian Organizations Concerned for Refugees, the organization was composed of approximately 100 refugee advocacy groups. Before the 2001 September 11 attacks in the US, the CCR issued a statement claiming that there was a disproportionate amount of immigration security provisions applied to particular refugee communities, including Kurds, Sri Lankan Tamils, Palestinians, Sikhs, people from Algeria, and people associated with the People's Mujahedin of Iran.Aiken, Sharryn J. 2007. \\"From Slavery to Expulsion: Racism, Canadian Immigration Law, and the Unfulfilled Promise of Modern Constitutionalism.\\" Pp. 55‚Äì111 in Interrogating Race and Racism., edited by V. Agnew. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. . p. 92. The CCR argued that, starting in January 2003, refugees became far less likely to show up for their asylum hearings, when Canadian officials stopped asking the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to guarantee that these refugees would not be arrested.Crep√©au, Fran√ßois, and Stephen H. Legomsky. 2007. \\"North American Responses: A Comparative Study of U.S. and Canadian Refugee Policy.\\" In New Regionalism and Asylum Seekers: Challenges Ahead, edited by S. Kneebone and F. Rawlings-Sanaei. Berghahn Books. . p. 157. Towards the end of 2005, the CCR became part of a coalition with Amnesty International and the Canadian Council of Churches to question the constitutionality of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States Safe Third Country Agreement.Aiken, Sharryn J. 2007. \\"Risking Rights: An Assessment of Canadian Border Security Policies.\\" Pp. 189‚Äì190 in Whose Canada?: Continental Integration, Fortress North America, and the Corporate Agenda, edited by R. Grinspun and Y. Shamsie. McGill-Queen's University Press. . According to the CCR, the agreement would result in increased illegal immigration and people smuggling.  Organization = Membership  The structure of the organization is based on membership. An organization must be a Canadian non- profit in order to join, while individuals can join as non-voting Associate Members. With over 170 member organizations, the Council has members in all of Canada's provinces (excluding territories).  Consultations  The CCR holds biannual consultations, the results of which are published on their website library. Each consultation, taking place over three days, has a specific focus. In the consultation of fall 2016, titled \\"Welcoming Diversity,\\" the CCR published their support for Bill C-6 (titled an Act to amend the Citizenship Act and make consequential amendments to another Act), which was introduced by the Liberal Party of Canada in the summer of 2017. Bill C-6 made significant amendments to Canada's Citizen Act, and made access to Canadian citizenship easier.  Relations with Government of Canada = Safe Third Country Agreement  In 2005, the CCR challenged the Canadian government's Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States, which came into effect in 2004. The Agreement stipulates that \\"refugee claimants are required to request refugee protection in the first safe country they arrive in, unless they qualify for an exception to the Agreement.\\" In the case of Canadian Council for Refugees, et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen, the CCR, along with the Canadian Council of Churches, Amnesty International, three NGOs and a John Doe, collectively took the Canadian government to Federal Court after a Colombian national was denied refugee status in the United States. At risk of refoulement due to his status being rendered illegal in the US, the court applicants claimed that the US was therefore not a \\"Safe Third Country\\" and that \\"[t]he United States' policies and practices do not meet the conditions set down for authorizing Canada to enter into a STCA. The U.S. does not meet the Refugee Convention requirements nor the Convention Against Torture prohibition.\\" Though, the Federal Court would uphold the challenge in 2007, the government appealed the decision in 2008, and so the STCA continues to be enforced.  Recommendations to the Canadian Government  In 2018, on Canada's Refugee Rights Day (4 April), the CCR published a set of three recommendations to the Canadian government, to: # Resettle 20,000 government- assisted refugees annually. # Ensure applications of privately-sponsored refugees are processed within 12 months. # Reform the refugee determination system so that all claimants have access to a fair hearing before an expert independent tribunal (i.e., the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada).

Symptoms generally consist of circular dark tan lesions that blight the leaf, water soaked leaves, stem cankers, and gummy brown ooze that exudes from cankers, giving it the name Gummy Stem Blight. Gummy Stem Blight reduces yields of edible cucurbits by devastating the vines and leaves and rotting the fruits. http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/09-051w.htm#disease There are various methods to control Gummy Stem Blight, including use of treated seed, crop rotation, using preventative fungicides, eradication of diseased material, and deep plowing previous debris.http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PP/PP28000.pdf Hosts and symptoms Gummy Stem Blight affects many cucurbits including watermelon, cantaloupe, cucumber, pumpkin, and some squash.http://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1995Articles/Phyto85n03_364.pdf Some symptoms are common of all Gummy Stem Blight infections while other symptoms can vary depending on the specific host the pathogen has infected. Hosts can become infected at any time in their life. When the pathogen is present in a young seedling, the cotyledons will sprout appearing dark and drenched.http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcollege/plantpathology/ext_files/PPFShtml/PPFS- VG-8.pdf When older plants become infected, their leaves may appear water soaked and begin to develop dark tan lesions. The leaves begin to turn brown at the margins and necrosis progresses towards the base of the leaf. Cankers, which may or may not have black spots, may appear in the epidermal cortical tissue and on the stems of infected plants. Black spots, if visible, are pycnidia and/or perithecia. Black rot is a common symptom on the fruit of Gummy Stem Blight infected cucurbits. Lesions formed on the fruit; start as water soaked spots that expand and exude gummy ooze. As the spots grow they develop fruiting bodies which turn the spots black. Fruit can also rot internally, with the only symptoms being shriveling and discoloration of centrally located tissue. Fruit rot can occur while in the field or after fruit has been harvested.Grabowski, Michelle. ‚ÄúDiseases of cucurbits‚Äù, ‚Äò‚ÄôUniversity of Minnesota Extension Services‚Äô‚Äô, Minnesota, 2013. Retrieved on 4 December 2013. D. bryoniae produces signs of infection such as white aerial mycelium, olive-green substrate mycelium and pycnidia. P. cucurbitacearum produces sparse serial mycelium and many pycnidia are present. Young leaves and cotelydons of melon and watermelon that are immature are at high risk to the Gummy Stem Blight infection whereas cucumber and some squash are resistant at young age and only become susceptible once they have matured. Disease cycle D. bryoniae is an Ascomycota fungus. In spring, asexual fruiting bodies called pycnidia and sexual fruiting bodies called perithecia are formed from last year‚Äôs infected plant debris. Pycnidia are flask-shaped structures that house asexual conidia which are readily released from pycnidia through the ostiole when enough moisture is present. Perithecia are also flask-shaped, but they are sexual fruiting bodies which give rise to bitunicate asci that contain 8 ascospores. Ascospores are readily dispersed and spread by wind after rain or during evening dew periods. Temperature and moisture are the most important factors for germination and development of the pathogen on the plant, with moisture being most important of all. Free moisture must be present on susceptible leaves for at least one hour in order for germination of spores to occur. The pathogen can enter a healthy host in a variety of ways. With enough moisture, conidia directly penetrate through the cuticle and infect healthy cucurbits. Wounds to the plant, especially those left by feeding insects such as the striped cucumber beetle or aphids, are important passageways for the pathogen to enter in older hosts. Other diseases, like Powdery Mildew, can also weaken a host enough to provide easy entry for D. bryoniae. After spore germination, symptoms can appear as soon as 7 days later. D. bryoniae survives on or in seeds, surrounding weeds, or organic debris from previously infected cucurbits. Without a host, the pathogen is able to overwinter and survive for over a year as chlamydospores, hardened masses of hyphae that act as survival structures during dry or otherwise adverse conditions. The pathogen is transferred from infected hosts to healthy plants via ascospores carried in the wind and by conidia that are released from pycnidia by water splash and in gummy exude. Conidia are hyaline and aseptate if produced by the anamorph, and either septate or aseptate (more common) if produced by the teleomorph form of the pathogen. The host must remain wet for growth and spread of the disease. Once the primary infection takes place, as long as it remains wet, the pathogen will spread to the stem where cankers form and ooze a gummy substance full of conidia. Conidia spread from the gummy ooze to another host is considered the secondary asexual cycle. Environmental presence Gummy Stem Blight occurs throughout the southern and eastern United States. Temperature and moisture are the most important factors in the spread of Gummy Stem Blight. For watermelon and cucumber, the best temperature for infection is around 25 ¬∞Ce; for melon the best temperature is around 20 ¬∞C. Continual leaf wetness from 1 ‚Äì 10 hours is necessary for germination, sporulation, and colonization of conidia. After infection has set in, large brown lesions will retain moisture for long periods of time. Even though it takes constant moisture to facilitate the pathogen, it is highly resistant to dry conditions and can survive as chlamydospores for over a year in dry organic debris. Management There are currently no varieties of cucurbit completely resistant to D. bryoniae. Cultural practices and preventive techniques can be taken to avoid or reduce harm done by D. bryoniae. Purchasing and planting reputable disease-free seeds is necessary for ensuring D. bryoniae will not be present at planting. A rotation (of at least 2 years) of cucurbit and non-cucurbit crops should be performed to greatly reduce the incidence of Gummy Stem Blight. Since Gummy Stem Blight can survive as chlamydospores in dead plant debris, it is recommended to remove or deep-plow dead cucurbit plant debris into the soil so it can fully decompose to lessen the likelihood of the pathogen overwintering. Keeping fields pruned and weed-free will help to control Gummy Stem Blight as overgrowth promotes poor air circulation and moisture from humidity, which support D. bryoniae germination and growth. If chemical control is needed in important cucurbit production regions, there are a variety of preventative fungicides commercially available that can be applied during the early stages of plant growth. Effective contact fungicides include chlorothalonil and mancozeb; effective systemic fungicides are Folicur¬Æ/Monsoon¬Æ, Inspire Super¬Æ, and Switch¬Æ.http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/BP/BP-142-W.pdf These fungicides should be applied around when the vines of different crops start to grow and make contact with each other Importance Yield losses due to D. bryoniae exceeding 30% can occur in early season crops facilitated by wet weather conditions.Keinath, A.P. (2000). Effect of protectant fungicide application schedules on Gummy Stem Blight epidemics and marketable yield of watermelon. Plant Disease84: 254‚Äì260 Curcurbits are important commodity crops in many parts of the world. In the United States, cucurbit production accounts for approximately 229,000 hectares with a value of $1.43 billion.Cantliffe, D.J., et al. \\"Current trends in cucurbit production in the U.S.\\", University of Florida Horticultural Society, United States, 2007.

Much earlier in 1944, he had joined the Vi·ªát Minh to fight for independence from the French. Yet as a Vietnamese Buddhist by 1949 he had decisively turned against Communism in Vietnam. He then joined pro-French forces. When Vietnam was divided in 1954, he became an officer in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). For many years he worked on assignments directly under President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám (1954‚Äì63). He became the mayor of Da Nang, and was later a province chief in the Mekong Delta. In particular, Ch√¢u became known for his innovative approaches to the theory and practice of counter-insurgency: the provision of security (\\"pacification\\") to civilian populations during the Vietnam War. The ultimate government goal of winning the hearts and minds of the people eventually led him to enter politics. In 1967, after resigning from the ARVN Ch√¢u was elected to the newly formed National Assembly in Saigon. He became a legislative leader. Along with others, however, he failed to persuade his old friend Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, the former general who had become President (1967‚Äì75), to turn toward a negotiated peace. Hence Ch√¢u associated with Assembly groups in opposition to the prevailing war policies and the ubiquitous corruption. Under the pretext that he spoke to his communist brother, Ch√¢u was accused of treason in 1970, during a major government crackdown on dissidents. Among others, Daniel Ellsberg spoke on his behalf before the United States Congress. Amid sharp controversy in South Vietnam, widely reported in the international press, Ch√¢u was tried and sent to prison for several years. Detention under house arrest followed. Soon after Saigon fell in 1975, he was arrested and held by the new communist regime, in a re-education camp. Released in 1978, he and his family made their escape by boat, eventually arriving in America in 1979.See text below for source references.

Traditionally Vietnam was a land of three religions (Tam Gi√°o): Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist. who lived in the ancient city of Hu·∫ø, then the imperial capital, on the coast of central Vietnam. Since birth records at that time were not common, his family designated January 1, 1924, as his birthday \\"just for convenience\\". His grandfather Tran Tram was a well-known scholar and a minister in the imperial cabinet, and his father Tran Dao Te was a chief judge.Fermoyle (2009), p. 422 (photo of grandfather), p. 423 (photo of father). As traditional members of the government, his family had \\"never resigned themselves to French rule.\\" Ch√¢u spent seven youthful years as a student monk at a Buddhist school and seminary. In addition he received a French education at a lyc√©e. Yet along with his brothers and sister, and following respected leaders, Ch√¢u became filled with \\"the Vietnamese nationalist spirit\\" and determined to fight for his country's independence.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at pp. 4‚Äì5, 7 (family background); at 8, 25 (joins Vi·ªát Minh); 8‚Äì9 (Buddhist school, French lyc√©e); 5 (two quotes). His mandarin grandfather (pp. 5, 79), and father (105). From a large family, Ch√¢u had three brothers and a sister who also joined the Vi·ªát Minh resistance (p. 109). Later Ch√¢u's own wife and six children, in addition to his small army pay, received income from family rental property (cf. p. 277).Grant (1991), re Tran Ngoc Ch√¢u: at 68‚Äì69 (family origins).Ch√¢u with Sturdevant (2001) p. 181. (brother joins Vi·ªát Minh), p. 182 (Ch√¢u). In the Vi·ªát Minh resistance Vi·ªát Minh flag In 1944, Ch√¢u joined the anti-French and anti- Japanese \\"resistance\\" (khang chien), that is, the Vi·ªát Minh. He followed two older brothers and a sister.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at p. 8 (family and Vi·ªát Minh); also p. 109.Grant (1991), pp. 69‚Äì70 (recruited for Vi·ªát Minh by a teacher and leader of Routiers, the French 'boy scouts'). \\"Ch√¢u and his brothers and sisters, all but the youngest boy, joined the Vi·ªát Minh\\" (p. 69).Chau with Sturdevant (2001) pp. 180‚Äì182. Then considered a popular patriotic organization, the Vi·ªát Minh emphasized Vietnamese nationalism.Tucker (2000) pp. 441‚Äì442. Vi·ªát Minh translates \\"Vietnam Independence League\\". Founded in 1941 as a \\"communist front organization\\" by 1945 it had successfully become the leading Vietnamese independence party by championing nationalism and obscuring its founders' class struggle ideology.Cf. Ho Chi Minh (1970) re Vi·ªát Minh: p. 30 [1941] (founded by communist party members, to attract nationalists and people of all classes), p. 32 [1945] (celebrates its support \\"from all social strata\\"), p. 46 [1951] (calculated concealment of communist class warfare doctrine in order to \\"unite the entire people\\").Cf. Halberstam (1971). Ho Chi Minh in 1941 was adamant that communists create a front party (the Vi·ªát Minh) to conceal their Soviet links, otherwise they would be vulnerable to charges of being controlled by foreigners. This front party must be more Vietnamese nationalist than any rival party (p. 63). Ho himself had then not set foot in Vietnam in 30 years (p. 61). Since 1924, he had worked as a professional revolutionary whose activities and travels were directed by the Communist International in Moscow (pp. 37, 39; 42, 44, 45‚Äì46; 70). Ch√¢u was picked to attend a 3-month \\"Political Military Course\\". Afterwards he was made a platoon leader.Ch√¢u, paper submitted to Congress, in US Senate (1970), p. 371. Here Ch√¢u mixed with peasants and workers for the first time, experiencing \\"the great gap between the privileged... and the underprivileged\\" and the \\"vital role\\" played by the rural villagers in Vietnam's destiny. He participated in the rigors of Vi·ªát Minh indoctrination, the \\"critiquing sessions\\" and party discipline, and admired the dedication of Vietnamese patriots. Exemplary was his young immediate superior Ho Ba, also from a mandarin family. Ch√¢u lived the rough life as a guerrilla soldier, entering combat many times. Yet he saw what he thought a senseless execution of a young woman justified as \\"revolutionary brutality.\\" He also saw evidence of similar harsh behavior by French colonial forces. Ch√¢u was selected to head a company (over a hundred soldiers) and led his compatriots into battle. Promoted then to \\"battalion political commissar\\", Ho Ba had asked him to join the Communist Party of Vietnam.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at pp. 12 (\\"great gap\\"); 33, 42‚Äì43, 54‚Äì55, 57‚Äì58 (Vi·ªát Minh doctrine); 87, 90‚Äì92, 101, 110 (yet Ho Ba opposed his father, pp. 91‚Äì92, because of his feudal privilege); 16‚Äì18 (senseless execution), 17 (\\"revolution is brutal\\" quote), cf. 37, [43], 58, 78, 80 (French brutality); 19, 23, 33, 117, 144 (leadership role in combat); 78‚Äì79 (commissar); 90‚Äì92, 113 (asked to join party by Ho Ba). About brutality, ironically it worked to increase support from the people (p. 78). Ch√¢u began in Vi·ªát Minh intelligence (p. 9), but soon switched to combat (p. 18). Years later, when Ch√¢u had changed sides and fought against the Viet Cong, he nonetheless used the \\"critiquing sessions\\" he'd learned from the Vi·ªát Minh (pp. 122, 162).Grant (1991). As a guerrilla Ch√¢u was wounded three times (p. 70), usually had little to eat, cut up rubber tires to make his sandals, \\"suffered malaria, and slept in a hammock in the rain and cold\\" (p. 72). Grant writes (at 70‚Äì71), contrary to Ch√¢u's memoirs (p. 78), that Ch√¢u was promoted to battalion commissar after the Vi·ªát Minh leadership dishonestly sentenced to death the prior commissar \\"for political reasons\\".Ch√¢u with Sturdevant (2001) p. 181. Many communist supporters within the Vi·ªát Minh were former political prisoners. During the Japanese occupation, communist party cadres had successfully recruited within the prisons. A year after Ch√¢u had entered the rural Vi·ªát Minh, Japan surrendered ending World War II. Up north Vi·ªát Minh armed forces seized control of Hanoi in the August Revolution. Ho Chi Minh (1890‚Äì1969) proclaimed Vietnamese independence, and became the first President.Halberstam (1971) pp. 75‚Äì78, 80‚Äì81.Tucker (2000) p. 446. The French, however, soon returned and war commenced anew. Several writers comment that in 1945 Ho Chi Minh had become indelibly identified with Vietnamese independence, conferring on him the Mandate of Heaven in the eyes of many Vietnamese, and that his ultimate victory against France and later America predictably followed.Robert Shaplen in his 1965 book The Lost Revolution presents a thesis that, in short, Ho's and the Vi·ªát Minh's national stature resulting from the independence achieved in 1945 already shaped the probable outcome of the Vietnam War. Cf. Shaplen (1970) p. xi.Karnow (1983) p. 146. In 1945 the Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's abdication conferred on Ho traditional legitimacy and the mandate of heaven. Later, \\"even anti-Communists regarded [Ho] as a hero\\" (p. 213). Re Dewey's OSS report: p. 139.Prados (2009) pp. 18, 19. A. Peter Dewey, leader of an OSS team to Vietnam in 1945, wrote a report strongly advising the U.S. stay out. In agreement were the views of the State Department's Far Eastern Bureau of John Carter Vincent and its Southeast Asia desk of Abbot Low Moffat.Cf. Fitzgerald (1972) p. 224. By his national charisma Ho \\"promoted himself out of the political sphere to become the revered 'ancestor' of the revolution within his lifetime.\\"Stephen B. Young, \\"The Mandate and Politics in Vietnam\\" pp. 13‚Äì34, in Donnell and Joiner (1974). \\"The central concept that runs through Vietnamese life is the ultimate power of heaven and its mandate over human affairs.\\" Such is fundamental in local traditions and is held by Buddhists. The Mandate of Heaven (mang troi in Vietnamese) is destiny and \\"assigns all of us our particular fate\\" (p. 13). The charisma of Ho Chi Minh in 1945 conferred on him a new mandate to rule, so that Ho could \\"legitimately replace old village councils\\" because his mandate would ultimately free Vietnam from foreigners (p. 26).Phan Thi Dac (1966) p. 92: 'Heaven' as determining destiny, a widespread belief. Cf., pp. 70, 78.Halberstam (1971) p. 82: In August 1945 \\"the Vi·ªát Minh had in one quick stroke taken over the nationalism of the country [and] Ho had achieved the legitimacy of power.\\" If the French \\"challenged him now they would only increase his authority.\\" Ho had become the \\"arbiter of Vietnamese nationalism\\". Accordingly, the Americans worked to avoid the national election scheduled for 1956 (p. 108).J. William Fulbright, The Price of Empire (New York: Pantheon 1989) p. 110: US President Eisenhower stated later that if the 1956 Vietnam elections (specified in the Geneva accords of 1954) had been held, Ho Chi Minh would have won by 80%.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) p. 294: The \\"honor and glory\\" from their war against the French still gave the Communists \\"an edge\\" into the late 1960s. Ch√¢u's promotion to battalion political officerAs is widely followed communist practice, Vi·ªát Minh units were led by both a political officer, who usually took priority, and a military officer. Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) pp. 78, 84. caused him to reflect on his path \\"from the contemplative life of a Buddhist monastery to the brutal reality of war.\\" The Vi·ªát Minh depended on popular support, which the political commissar facilitated and propagated. In that position, Ch√¢u was called upon to show his \\"personal conviction\\" in the war and in the \\"social revolution\\", and to inspire the goodwill of the people. \\"It was equally vital that the political commissar be able to impart that conviction\\", to set \\"a high standard for others to emulate\\". To do so, Ch√¢u says, was like \\"converting to a new religion\\". About Vi·ªát Minh ideology and practices, his Buddhist convictions were divided: he favored \\"social justice, compassion, and liberation of the individual\\" but he opposed the \\"cultivated brutality\\" and \\"obsessive hatred\\" of the enemy, and the condemnation of \\"an entire social class\\". Ch√¢u found himself thinking that communist leaders from the mandarin class were using their peasant recruits to attack mandarin political rivals. \\"President Ho and General Gi√°p... came from the very classes\\" that communist indoctrination was teaching the cadres to hate.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) pp. 78‚Äì79, 86‚Äì87; quotes: 78‚Äì79, 86 (re Ho and Gi√°p); pp. 58, 86‚Äì87, 99 (Ch√¢u observes political contradiction in Vi·ªát Minh leaders, e.g., Ho Chi Minh from the literate elite, who preached class hatred, and educated communist politicians in general who in pursuit of power manipulate rural peasants in order to eliminate their bourgeois mandarin rivals).Ch√¢u with Sturdevant (2001) p. 184. \\"It was the bourgeoisie, the mandarins, and the aristocrats... who formed the backbone of Ho Chi Minh's [republic] in 1945.\\"Halberstam (1971) pp. 70‚Äì71. Ho had a \\"hard and callous side rarely seen in public\\" and was proud of being a \\"tough old Bolshevik\\" even though he had seen the \\"crimes of Stalin\\". His lieutenants \\"liquidated rival nationalist elements\\", betraying \\"true Vietnamese patriots\\" because they were the competition. Ho's father was a mandarin (pp. 18, 43). In the 1920s Ho is said to have sold out Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u, a revered elder Vietnamese patriot and a friend of Ho's father, to the French for 150,000 piasters (pp. 21, 44‚Äì45). Yet Ch√¢u's duties, e.g., in \\"critiques and self-criticism sessions\\" and fighting the guerrilla war, left him little time for \\"personal philosophizing\\". When asked to join the party, Ch√¢u realized that, like most Vietnamese people in the Vi·ªát Minh, \\"I really knew little about communism.\\"Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at pp. 79‚Äì80, 84‚Äì87; two quotes at 79‚Äì80, \\"about communism\\" quote p. 92. Ch√¢u settled on an army career (p. 116). After four years spent mostly in the countryside and forest; the soldier Ch√¢u, eventually came to a state of disagreement with the resistance leadership when he learned of its half-hidden politics, and what he took to be the communist vision for Vietnam's future. Although the Vi·ªát Minh was then widely considered to represent a popular nationalism, Ch√¢u objected to its core communist ideology which rejected many Vietnamese customs, traditional family ties, and the Buddhist religion.E.g., Halberstam (1971) pp. 92‚Äì93. Peasants were advised by the Vi·ªát Minh that their political duties overrode the traditional duty of filial piety to their family.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at pp. 98‚Äì100: Several experience turned Ch√¢u. For one, he witnessed a Vi·ªát Minh revolutionary trial of an older French governor of \\"honorable service\\" Ho Ngan (p. 91: \\"a mandarin of integrity\\"), whose son was a now communist leader (at 87, 90‚Äì92). The trial's guilty verdict and sentence of 20 years detention clarified Ch√¢u's own \\"change of heart\\". The mandarin official's son was Ch√¢u's former comrade Ho Ba. He quit the Vi·ªát Minh in 1949. Although remaining a nationalist in favor of step-by- step independence, he severed his ties, and began his outright opposition to communism.Lansdale (1972) pp. 152‚Äì153. Such a switch in political sides was not uncommon among Vietnamese during that era. Each of the semi-independent armed sects (the religious cults the H√≤a H·∫£o and the Cao ƒê√†i, and the criminal B√¨nh Xuy√™n) first joined, then decisively broke with, the Vi·ªát Minh in the late 1940s.Grant (1991): Tran Ngoc Ch√¢u at 69‚Äì76 (Vi·ªát Minh defection, becomes anti-communist). Grant's 1991 account here differs in detail from Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012). \\"I realized my devotion to Buddhism distanced me from Communist ideology\\", Ch√¢u wrote decades later in his memoirs.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) p. 102 (Buddhism vs. Communism quote).Cf., Sheehan, (1988) at p. 609. Sheehan amply notes Ch√¢u's \\"winning qualities\\" stating that \\"Ch√¢u proved himself an able Vi·ªát Minh fighter, rising from squad leader to acting battalion commander.\\" Yet Sheehan, often a harsh skeptic of political explanation, evidently thought he detected another, more ambiguous reason why Ch√¢u left the Vi·ªát Minh. Ch√¢u's \\"dilemma was that he was too temperamental to endure the self-effacement and group discipline the Vietnamese Communist Party demanded of its cadres... .\\" Sheehan records in his book (p. 796) his interview of Ch√¢u.Grant (1991) comments on Ch√¢u's defection (p. 84) from the Vi·ªát Minh. > Ch√¢u and the United States shared the same dilemma. Neither liked French > colonialism, but both were opposed to communism. In its way, Washington's > decision was as tortured bureaucratically as Ch√¢u's was personally. The > difference was that many of the communists were Ch√¢u's friends, including > his brothers and sisters, and however misguided he considered their > ideology, he knew them as patriots ‚Äì not as faceless members of a Moscow- > directed conspiracy, as Washington saw them. (Grant (1991) p. 87.) Ellsberg (2002, 2003) at pp. 116‚Äì117: meeting Ch√¢u in 1965; Ch√¢u's earlier decisive choice for Buddhism and nationalism versus his respect for some facets of Vi·ªát Minh ideology. \\"Like other [Americans] who knew him, I found his commitment reassuring.\\" In the army of B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i France reinstalled B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, 1949‚Äì55, last sovereign of the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty.Tucker (2000) pp. 34‚Äì35. Crowned in 1926 at age 13, his 1930s reform efforts were stymied by the French; he later became known as a playboy and preferred living in France. Yet his new situation \\"between the lines of war\\" was precarious; it could prove to be fatal if he was captured by either the French or the Vi·ªát Minh.Cf., Lansdale (1972; 1991). Then independent Vietnamese nationalists \\"risked both arrest by the French as subversives and murder by the rival Communists\\" (p. 146). Ch√¢u's precarious situation was not very unusual, e.g., \\"the legendary rebel guerrilla chief\\" Tr√¨nh Minh Th·∫ø. He had fought both the French colonialists and the Vi·ªát Minh communists. Both then \\"wanted him dead\\" (p. 184, quote). Eventually, Th·∫ø did join his forces to the national army in 1955 (pp. 192, 199), but then a sniper killed him while fighting against the B√¨nh Xuy√™n in Saigon (p. 308).Cf. Phillips (2008) pp. 23, 323 n5 (former Vi·ªát Minh who joined the ARVN). Soon Ch√¢u, unarmed, wearing khakis and a Vi·ªát Minh fatigue cap, carefully approached H·ªôi An provincial headquarters in French- controlled Vietnam and cried, \\"I'm a Vi·ªát Minh officer and I want to talk... .\\" He was interrogated by civil administrators, S√ªret√©, and the military, both French nationals and Vietnamese. Later Ch√¢u shared his traditional nationalism with an elder Vietnamese leader, Governor Phan Van Giao, whose strategy was to outlast the French and then reconcile with the Vi·ªát Minh.Cf. Fall (1966) p. 148: 1954 letter of Cao ƒê√†i nationalist leader to Ho Chi Minh urging \\"reconciliation\\" with the emperor Bao-Dai, following the French defeat. At a caf√© he recognized the young waitress as a former, or current, Vi·ªát Minh. Ch√¢u's Buddhist father, Tran Dao Te, suggested he seek religious guidance through prayer and meditation to aid him in his decision making. Two brothers, and a sister with her husband remained Vi·ªát Minh; yet Ch√¢u came to confirm his traditional nationalism, and his career as a soldier.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), at pp. 104‚Äì108 (danger crossing lines, \\"debriefing\\"); 108 (Vi·ªát Minh waitress); 108‚Äì109, 115 (inner conflict); 109‚Äì110, 115 (father's counsel), 110‚Äì111, 113‚Äì114, 114‚Äì115 (Phan Van Giao). > I had quit the Vi·ªát Minh because I wanted independence for my country, but > not with its traditional society and roots totally destroyed, which was the > Communists' goal. I wanted to preserve the value of our culture and my > religion, to see peace and social justice for everyone, but without > unnecessary class struggle.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle at 115 (quote); cf., 85‚Äì87, > 113. Nonetheless, Ch√¢u's family had divided loyalties. Two brothers, and a > sister with her husband, remained with the communist side throughout the > war; Ch√¢u and a younger brother chose to serve South Vietnam. Chau (2012) at > pp. 109, 317‚Äì318.Grant (1991) p. 74: After leaving the Vi·ªát Minh, Ch√¢u > started the short-lived magazine Fatherland to promote reconciliation. In 1950, Ch√¢u entered a military academy at Dalat (north of Saigon) established by the French to train officers for the Vietnamese National Army, nominally under the emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i. By then America, Britain, and Thailand recognized Vietnam's 'independence'. Graduating as a lieutenant he was assigned to teach at the academy. Ch√¢u then married Bich Nhan whom he had met in Hu·∫ø. The couple shared a villa and became friends with another young army couple, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu and his wife. Thi·ªáu also had served in the Vi·ªát Minh, during 1945‚Äì46, before crossing over to the other side.Prados (2009) p. 343. Later Thi·ªáu became President (1967‚Äì75) of the Republic of Vietnam. In 1953 Ch√¢u traveled to Hanoi (Vietnam being not yet divided) for advanced military study. On his next assignment near H·ªôi An his battalion was surprised by a Vi·ªát Minh ambush. His unit's survival was in doubt. For his conduct in battle Ch√¢u was awarded the highest medal. He was also promoted to captain. Following French defeat in 1954, full independence, and partition of Vietnam into north and south, Ch√¢u served in the military of the southern government, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN).Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), at pp. 114 (Vietnamese Army, Vietnam as independent 1950); 112‚Äì113, 116‚Äì117 (military academy, army career [& p. 278]); 118 (his marriage, and Thi·ªáu); 130‚Äì131 (Hanoi); 131‚Äì135 (H·ªôi An: battle, commendation and promotion).Grant (1991) at 21, 75, 133‚Äì135 (Ch√¢u's early army career).Lansdale (1972) pp. 129‚Äì130, 143‚Äì146 (political status of Vietnam 1945‚Äì1954).Halberstam (1971) 104. The journalist author comments: by the victory of 1954, Ho became a \\"national hero\\" and his army of \\"tough Communist peasants\\" had worked not just a defeat of the French, but of \\"the mandarin order\\". Division of the country resulted in massive population shifts, with most Vi·ªát Minh soldiers and cadre (90,000) heading north,Fitzgerald (1972) p. 69 (soldiers and cadres to the north). and some Buddhists (300,000) and many Catholics (800,000) heading south.Venerable Giac Duc, \\"Buddhists and Catholics, the beginning\\" pp. 38‚Äì42, at 39 (Buddhists going south), in Chanoff and Toai (1986).Tucker (2000) p. 360. Northern Catholics going south, with 600,000 remaining in the north.Gheddo (1968; 1970) pp. 58 (Catholics [and Buddhists] going south), 66 (many prevented from leaving the north).Huntington (1968) pp. 310‚Äì311. Forcing \\"unassimilable elements\\" into exile creates in those remaining a \\"new homogenous community\\" and hence strengthens the ruling party, e.g., Turkey, North Vietnam, Cuba, and East Germany. The Vi·ªát Minh remnant and 'stay behinds' in the south used \\"armed propanganda\\" to recruit new followers.Duncanson (1978) pp. 11‚Äì17. The quoted phrase (p. 14) is attributed to writings of their party leader Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh and General V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p. Duncanson comments that \\"if propaganda is armed its cogency is more likely to repose in the weapon than in the argument\\" (p. 14). The pre-1954 conflict was \\"fought mainly in North Vietnam\\" (p. 11).Cf., Warner (1964) pp. 142‚Äì144, 191‚Äì192: 'speech only' tactics of Vi·ªát Minh/Viet Cong in the south after 1954, often centered on talking to peasant farmers about the control of the land. Eventually they formed the National Liberation Front (NLF), which soon came to be \\"known as the Viet Cong by its enemies\\" (and by the press corps and politicians of America). It fought against the Republic of Vietnam (capital: Saigon), in a continuation of its national struggle for communist revolution and control. By 1960 use of armed violence became the practical policy of the communist party that dominated the NLF, both supported by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 132, 399 note 10 (re Vi·ªát Minh and NLF or Viet Cong).Tucker (2000), \\"National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam\\" at 284‚Äì285. The Viet Cong was supplied and reinforced by the North.Truong Nhu Tang (1985) pp. 128‚Äì129: COSVN was run by the North's Lao Dong Party; it worked to coordinate the communist-directed efforts in the south; pp. 146‚Äì147: the NLF founded its Provisional Revolutionary Government in 1969. Service in the Di·ªám regime During the transition from French rule to full independence Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám,Warner (1963) pp. 84‚Äì92 (Di·ªám s background). In 1933 Diem, then Interior Minister, had resigned because of French restrictions on his authority, thus gaining stature as a nationalist. In 1945 he declined the office of prime minister offered by the Japanese. the President of the Republic, although making costly mistakes managed to lead the southern state through a precarious stage in the establishment of its sovereignty.Cf., Karnow (1983) at pp. 213‚Äì239, e.g., blocking a coup, disarming the militant sects (Cao ƒê√†i and H√≤a H·∫£o), and defeat of criminal syndicate (B√¨nh Xuy√™n), pp. 219‚Äì223; Diem's character and background, pp. 213‚Äì218. Meanwhile, Ch√¢u in 1955 became commandant of cadets, director of instruction, at his alma mater the Vietnamese military academy at Dalat. He recommended curriculum changes, e.g., inclusion of Vietnamese history and guerrilla warfare, yet the American advisor resisted. For a time he also ran afoul of the secretive C·∫ßn Lao political party, a major support of the Di·ªám regime.Tucker (2000), \\"C·∫ßn Lao... \\" at pp. 59‚Äì60.Joiner (1974) pp. 41‚Äì44: C·∫ßn Lao. The American military sponsored special training at Fort Benning, Georgia, for a group of Vietnamese Army officers including Ch√¢u. Later, after transferring from the Fourth Infantry Division, he became chief of staff at Quang Trung Training Center, a large Vietnamese Army facility. There Ch√¢u discovered corruption among suppliers.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at pp. 142‚Äì144 (Fort Benning); pp. 140, 145‚Äì150 (Dalat); pp. 148‚Äì150, 151 (C·∫ßn Lao); 151‚Äì155 (Quang Trung); cf., 231 (positions).Grant (1991) at pp. 131, 133‚Äì134 (Dalet military academy); 132 (Fort Benning).Cf. Valentine (1990) at 49‚Äì50. Ch√¢u is described as a \\"graduate of Fort Bragg\\" where he roomed with future President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu. Valentine also states that in 1962 Ch√¢u completed \\"a six year tour as chief of the GSV's Psychological Warfare Service\\". These descriptions differ somewhat from Grant (1991) and Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012). Valentine here mentions Ch√¢u in connection with several USG agents in Vietnam in 1962 and, without more, denominates Ch√¢u as \\"a CIA asset\\". President Di·ªám In 1959, at the request of his commanding officer, Ch√¢u prepared a report for the president's eyes. Unexpectedly, President Di·ªám then scheduled a meeting with Ch√¢u ostensibly to discuss his well-prepared report. Instead Di·ªám spoke at length of his high regard for Ch√¢u's mandarin grandfather the state minister Tran Tram, for his father and his accomplished family in Hu·∫ø, the former Vietnamese capital.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at pp. 156‚Äì157 (report for Di·ªám, interview); at p. 278: > \\"When President Di·ªám called on me to work in his government, I felt I owed > him both respect and gratitude for selecting me, though I knew his esteem > for my family was at least partially responsible for my appointment.\\" Ch√¢u's grandfather, the scholar and imperial minister, was Tran Tram (p. 79).Cf., Ch√¢u with Sturdevant (2001) p. 195. The President, himself of a mandarin family, cultivated a formal Confucian style.Cf., Warner (1963; 1964) at p. 87, on Di·ªám's family's mandarin status and his father Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh·∫£. \\"The Ng√¥ Dinhs were one of the great families of Vietnam.\\"Grant (1991) at 69: Grant reports that Ch√¢u's father thought his Buddhist family enjoyed superior status to Di·ªám's which, although also mandarin, had become Catholic.Joiner (1974) p. 36. Diem was seen as a \\"scholar-patriot\\" with the two prized political virtues of the Vietnamese, \\"virtue and ability\\". His \\"personal incorruptibility\\" allowed him to appear \\"the recipient of the Mandate of Heaven\\". Au contraire, Ho Chi Minh, also from a mandarin family, preferred instead a villager identity, being popularly known as \\"Uncle Ho\\" [Bac Ho in Vietnamese].Tr∆∞∆°ng Nh∆∞ T·∫£ng (1985) pp. 10‚Äì17, at 12 (Bac Ho or \\"uncle Ho\\"). In Paris in 1946 the youthful author met President Ho who wore native clothes and sandals. Ho communicated \\"wisdom and caring\\" like the author's Confucian grandfather.FitzGerald (1972): Ho Chi Minh's father was a mandarin of Ngh·ªá An (p. 60). Yet the austere Ho, in adopting a western social ideology (communism), consciously discarded the mandarin's formal leadership image, adopting instead the more inviting public persona of a village uncle (224‚Äì225).Woodside (1976) pp. 234‚Äì239: \\"The Triumph of the Mandarin Proletatrians\\" wherein the author describes \\"the determination of a part of the old elite to change its own 'class' postures in order to salvage its leadership mission.\\"Cf., Joiner (1974) pp. 62‚Äì63: The mandarin figure in Vietnam also had \\"unfavorable characteristics\\", e.g., officials concerned with their \\"prestige and authority\\" rather than \\"the people's needs and wants\\", and civil servants who were obsequious toward superiors and harsh to subordinates. It was said, \\"In every Vietnamese there is a mandarin.\\" The time-honored Confucian philosophyIn Vietnamese: \\"Nho Giao\\". behind the traditional mandarin ethic, remains in Vietnamese culture and elsewhere.Duiker (1989), pp. 36‚Äì37. Yet it had been challenged in East Asia, methodically and decisively, since the arrival of western culture.Cf., Furth (in Goldman and Lee 2002) pp. 15‚Äì16, 41‚Äì42; Schwartz, ibid., pp. 113‚Äì118. Confucian social philosophy in China passed through a severe iconoclastic crisis in the late 19th century. By 1905 its imperial examination system sponsored by the government for millennia had come to a halt (Schwartz, p. 112). During this crisis its historical and natural orientations were thoroughly transformed, in various ways, by those neo-traditionalists who still maintained their confucian allegiance (e.g., Furth, 48‚Äì50, 63‚Äì65). Nonetheless many Chinese, including in particular the communists, abandoned Confucius altogether for a more radical philosophic change, in order to better acculturate to modernism and western science and technology (cf., Furth, 40‚Äì41, 65, 70‚Äì71, and 92‚Äì96).de Bary (1991) pp. 103‚Äì104. During the May Fourth Movement of 1919, \\"Confucianism was made to stand for all that was backward and benighted in China. ...policital corruption and repression, the suppression of women, concubinage, female infanticide, illiteracy, etcetera, etcetera.\\"Pham Van Minh (2002) pp. 156‚Äì161. A similar cultural process occurred in Vietnam, where Confucian exams were also halted (p. 159). According to Pham Van Minh, a Vietnamese Buddhist, \\"Confucianism collapsed at the beginning of the twentieth century\\" (p. 238). The revolutionary Chinese Communist Party had vilified it.Cf., Yang Jung-kuo, \\"Confucius--a thinker who stubbornly supported the slave system\\" pp. 1‚Äì24, and Feng Yu-lan, \\"A criticism of Confucius... \\" pp. 88‚Äì106, in Selected Articles Criticizing Lin Piao and Confucius (Peking: Foreign Languages Press 1974). Here the celebrated exemplar of Confucian virtue is unmasked to be an ideology sourced in ruling class privilege, which it effectly propagates and enforces.Cf., Schram (in Goldman and Lee 2002): Although \\"Mao Tse-tung also found positive elements in Confucian philosophy\\" (p. 327), from the beginning \\"Mao saw China's ancient and rigid thought-patterns as an obstacle to progress\\" (p. 272).Mao, \\"Beat back the attack of the bourgeois rightists\\" (1957) in Mao Tse-tung, Selected Works, 5 vols. (Peking 1960‚Äì1965, 1970) cited in Schram, The Thought of Mao Tse-tung (Cambridge University 1989, 1999) p. 125. Mao lumped together \\"Confucian classics and capitalist rubbish\\" (5.469‚Äì470) and saw \\"ghosts and monsters opposed to the Communist Party and the people\\" (5.444). Modified teachings of the ancient sage continue, however, and across East Asia Confucian influence has increased markedly during the 21st century.Confucian traditions subsist today, e.g., in Taiwan, Singapore, Korea, and Japan, and ironically are resurgent in the PRC. Cf., de Bary ( 1991) pp. x‚Äìxi.Pankaj Mishra (2012), p. 257 (quote): Until 1980 \\"the Chinese Communists tried to root out Confucianism from China... . But as the appeal of communism has declined, party officials have returned to upholding Confucianism.\\" Recently, the Chinese government has founded hundreds of Confucius Institutes throughout the world.Goldman (in Goldman and Lee 2002) p. 505, on China: \\"A revival of Confucianism was another effort to close the wounds inflicted by Mao's class struggle and anti-intellectualism.\\"A leading Confucian political leader was Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, under whose guidance (1959‚Äì1990) the city rose to prosperity and prominence. His authoritarian Confucianism was included as Asian values. By 1978 its economic success had drawn interest and praise from Deng Xiaoping, who then led China to emulate its market inclusive economy. Orville Schell, \\"Lee Kuan Yew, the Man who remade Asia\\" in the Wall Street Journal March 28, 2015. For Di·ªám and Ch√¢u, its values served as a major reference held in common.Cf., Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) pp. 115, 157, 203, 278, 295. Investigating the Civil Guard Soon after Di·ªám assigned Ch√¢u to the Civil Guard and Self-Defense Corps as inspector for 'psychological and social conditions'. Following Di·ªám's instructions Ch√¢u investigated the Guard's interaction with the people and its military effectiveness.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at pp. 158‚Äì159 (Civil Guard). Di·ªám had told Ch√¢u that his job was extremely important as the popular reputation of the Civil Guard in the countryside largely influenced how most people thought about the entire military.Grant (1991) at pp. 134 (job importance, different version of Ch√¢u's interview with Di·ªám).Andrad√© (1990) at 35. Under the Interior Ministry, the Civil Guard \\"consisted of forty thousand lightly armed soldiers organized into mobile companies\\" to counter Communist violence. \\"A hamlet militia called the Self-Defense Corps was also formed and dispersed in ten man squads.\\" The Civil Guard (Bao An) was ineffective, poorly paid and poorly trained. Moreover, they preyed on the peasants whom they were supposed to protect. The Guard's political superiors, the provincial and local officials, were \\"holdovers from the French\\". To them, anyone who had participated in the independence struggle against France was suspected of being 'Viet Cong'. Ch√¢u recommended general reforms: elimination of bribery and corruption, land reform, education, and the cultivation of a nationalist spirit among the people. Ch√¢u noted that the Americans aided only the military, ignoring the Civil Guard despite its daily contact with rural people and the Viet Cong.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 158‚Äì167 (as Civil Guard inspector); p. 159 (quote).Cf., Karnow (1983) at 227, 229. President Di·ªám instructed Ch√¢u to develop a \\"refresher course\\" for the Guard. In doing so Ch√¢u addressed such content as: increased motivation, efforts to \\"earn the trust\\" of the people, better intelligence gathering, \\"interactive self- critical sessions\\", and the protection of civilians. Thereafter, Di·ªám appointed Ch√¢u as a regional commander of the Civil Guard for seven provinces of the Mekong Delta. American officials, military and CIA, began to show interest in Ch√¢u's work.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), p. 166 (American visitors [also British counterinsurgency expert Robert Thompson from Malaysia]); quotes: 162, 163. Journalist Grant writes that in the Mekong \\"Ch√¢u's job was to set an example that could be followed throughout the country.\\"Grant (1991) at p. 135 (quote). American visitors were taken to see Ch√¢u's project by William Colby, then CIA station chief in Saigon. Yet despite the efforts made, Ch√¢u sensed that a \\"great opportunity\\" was being missed: to build a national √©lan among the country people of South Vietnam that would supplant the vapid air of the French holdovers, and to reach out to former Vi·ªát Minh in order to rally them to the government's side.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012): here Di·ªám, his regime, and American advisors, being too rigid in their anti-communist aims, \\"missed a great opportunity\\" to reconcile with former Vi·ªát Minh and to convert rural villagers to the national cause (p. 161).Ch√¢u with Sturdevant (2001) p. 189. \\"Instead, Diem's police persecuted [former Vi·ªát Minh] and drove them back into the arms of the communists.\\"Tr∆∞∆°ng Nh∆∞ T·∫£ng (1985): Diem's attempt to eliminate rivals by attacking the \\"anti-French guerrilla fighters\\" was a \\"disastrous tactic\\". It resulted in his \\"irrevocably alienating himself from the emotional nationalism that had been the most potent force in Vietnam for a decade\\" (p. 38). Also \\"the established nationalist parties were furious\\" when the 1959 assembly elections were completely taken by Diem candidates; later decrees \\"shut off the possibility of a loyal opposition\\" (p. 40).Cf., Karnow (1983) pp. 224‚Äì226. In the north, the communist regime also moved to silence opposition. A land reform program based on class warfare, with liquidation quotas for village landlords, \\"touched off atrocities throughout the country.\\" Party cadres themselves \\"seized the property of the condemned\\". Facing province-wide peasant uprisings, Ho stepped in, and communist rule survived. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was removed as head of the party. Later Chinese communist advisors were blamed. Following up on Ch√¢u's Civil Guard experience, Di·ªám sent him to troubled Malaysia to study the pacification programs there. Among other things, Ch√¢u found that, in contrast to Vietnam, in Malaysia (a) civilian officials controlled pacification rather than the military, (b) when arresting quasi-guerrillas certain legal procedures were followed, and (c) government broadcasts were more often true than not. When he returned to Saigon during 1962, his personal meeting with the president lasted a whole day. Yet a subsequent meeting with the president's brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu disappointed Ch√¢u's hopes. Then President Di·ªám appointed Ch√¢u the provincial governor of Ki·∫øn H√≤a in the Mekong Delta. Ch√¢u objected that as a military officer he was not suited to be a civil administrator, but Di·ªám insisted.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 167‚Äì170.See \\"Ki·∫øn H√≤a\\" subsection below. ƒê√† N·∫µng: Buddhist crisis Buddhist flag In the meantime, the Di·ªám regime in early 1963 issued an order banning display of all non-state flags throughout South Vietnam. By its timing the order would first apply to the Buddhist flag during the celebration of Buddha's Birthday (Le Ph√°t Dan) in May. Ch√¢u and many Buddhists were \\"outraged\\" and he called the President's office. Di·ªám's family was Catholic. Ch√¢u held not Di·ªám himself, but his influential brothers, responsible for the regime's \\"oppressive policies toward Buddhists\\".Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at 203 (Di·ªám's brothers).Ch√¢u with Sturdevant (2001) pp. 196‚Äì198. It was a \\"monumental blunder\\". Diem later considered dismissing his brother Nhu and Madame Nhu, yet he resisted American pressure.Warner (1964), pp. 116, 120. Among Di·ªám's brothers: Nhu (chief advisor, head of C·∫ßn Lao party, police and special forces), C·∫©n (civil leader in central Vietnam), Th·ª•c (Catholic archbishop of Hu·∫ø), and Luy·ªán (ambassador to Britain). The eldest brother Khoi had been a governor, but was killed by the Vi·ªát Minh in the mid-1940s (p. 85). The next morning a small plane arrived in Ki·∫øn H√≤a Province to take Ch√¢u to Saigon to meet with Di·ªám. After discussion, Di·ªám in effect gave Ch√¢u complete discretion as province chief in Ki·∫øn H√≤a. But soon in Hu·∫ø, violence erupted: nine Buddhists were killed. Then \\"fiery suicides\\" by Buddhist monks made headlines and stirred the Vietnamese.Fitzgerald (1972) pp. 74, 129‚Äì130.Halberstam (1972) at 307. The Diem regime had been \\"tainted by the foreign touch\\". The Buddhists in 1963 appeared to champion a thoroughly independent Vietnamese nationalism \\"which had no contact with the Americans, did not take their money... or visit their ambassador.\\" Neither was it communist. Di·ªám then quite abruptly appointed Ch√¢u mayor of the large city of ƒê√† N·∫µng near Hu·∫ø. At the time Da Nang had also entered a severe civil crisis involving an intense, local conflict between Buddhists and Catholics. These emergencies were a seminal part of what became the nationwide Buddhist crisis. From Di·ªám's instructions, Ch√¢u understood that as mayor he would have \\"complete authority to do what [he] thought was right\\". During the troubles in Da Nang, Ch√¢u met with Di·ªám in Saigon nearly every week.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 185‚Äì188 (quotes); 199 (Di·ªám meetings).Ch√¢u with Sturdevant (2001) pp. 196‚Äì197: Ch√¢u given \\"complete authority\\" to \\"do the right thing\\" in Da Nang, where he is appointed mayor and governor.Valentine (1990), p. 305. In parallel with Ch√¢u, at the same time Diem appointed Nguyen Mau as mayor of nearby Hue with a similar mission. Mau, also a graduate of Dalat Military Academy (1954), later became chief of the Special Branch of the National Police.Tucker (2000), Buddhists at pp. 48‚Äì49.Karnow (1983) at pp. 279‚Äì281 (Buddhists; Buddha's Birthday in 1963).Warner (1964) at pp. 225‚Äì234. Pagoda in Hu·∫ø Arriving in Da Nang, Ch√¢u consulted separately first with the Buddhist monks, and then later with units of the army stationed in Da Nang (most of whose soldiers Ch√¢u describes as Catholics originally from northern VietnamTucker (2000) p. 360. Catholics both supported and resisted the French. Yet the Vi·ªát Minh accused all Catholics of collaboration, attacked their villages and persecuted them. 800,000 Catholics fled to the south after 1954, although 600,000 remained in the north. and anti-Buddhist). A Buddhist elder who arrived from Hu·∫ø (Ch√¢u's hometown, about 100 km. north of Da Nang) endorsed Ch√¢u to his co-religionists as a loyal Buddhist. As Da Nang mayor he ordered the release of Buddhists held in detention by the army. When an army colonel refused to obey Ch√¢u, he called President Di·ªám who quickly replaced the rebellious colonel. \\"The city returned to near-normal.\\"Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 190‚Äì191, 192‚Äì193; quote at 193. Yet that August, instigated by Di·ªám's brother Nhu, armed forces of the Saigon regime conducted the infamous pagoda raids throughout Vietnam, which left many Buddhist monks in jail.Colby (1978) at 208‚Äì210. Nhu was \\"the devil behind the pagoda raids\\" (p. 209). Colby had been the CIA's station chief in Saigon until 1962; in 1963 he headed the CIA's \\"Far East Division\\".Cf., Karnow (1983) at pp. 285‚Äì286 (temple raids). In Da Nang, Ch√¢u rescued an elderly monk from police custody. Then Ch√¢u met with hostile Buddhists in a \\"stormy session\\". The Buddhist wanted to stage a large demonstration in Da Nang, to which Ch√¢u agreed, but he got a fixed route, security, and assurances. During the parade, however, the Catholic Cathedral in Da Nang was stoned. Ch√¢u met with protesting Vietnamese Catholics, especially with Father An. He reminded them that \\"Di·ªám, a devout Catholic\\" had appointed him mayor of Da Nang. Accordingly, it was his duty to \\"be fair to everyone\\" and to favor no one. \\"Passions subsided gradually on all sides, and relative calm returned to the city\\" of Da Nang by late October.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 193‚Äì197. Quotes: at p. 194, two at 197.Cf., Topmiller (2002), pp. 2‚Äì6: difficulties and tragedies met by Buddhists in Vietnamese politics, 1963‚Äì1966. A few days later Ch√¢u heard fresh rumors of a military plot against Di·ªám.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 197‚Äì198 (rumors). Senior elements in the military, encouraged by the American embassy (yet American support vacillated), had been meeting. They began to plan the 1963 coup d'√©tat, which occurred on November 1.Karnow (1983) at pp. 304‚Äì311 (coup).Tucker (2000), p. 291: Di·ªám's fall, from conflicts over Buddha's birthday to the 1963 military coup. Di·ªám's fall, aftermath Di·ªám was shot inside an Army vehicle.right200pxthumb When Ch√¢u arrived at the Saigon airport from Da Nang for another routine meeting with President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, gunfire could be heard. Speculation about the military coup was rife, causing widespread disorder and urban panic. As the military-controlled radio carried news about the ongoing coup, Ch√¢u telephoned the president's office (the \\"line suddenly went dead\\"), and then officer colleagues‚Äîin the process Ch√¢u declined an invitation to join the coup. At a friend's home he waited, apprehensive of the outcome. Di·ªám and his brother Nhu were both killed early the next morning, November 2, 1963.Bui Diem (1987), p. 105: Diem was killed \\"on personal order of Big Minh\\" (unverified account). Bui Diem (no relation to the President) was later the South Vietnamese ambassador in Washington, D.C.Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n (1978) pp. 110‚Äì113. D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh [aka 'Big Minh'], a general and coup leader, was responsible for the murders, according to author Don (also a top coup leader, and later a leading Senator).Accord: Colby (1978) p. 215: D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, known as \\"Big Minh\\", ordered the killings. Colby had been the CIA's COS in Saigon, was then head of its Far East division.Sheehan (1988), p. 371: Minh ordered Diem's murder.Topmiller (2002), p. 4, says merely \\"executed by rebellious troops\\". The author describes General Minh, the new head of state, as political Buddhism's point man to end the war (pp. 15‚Äì16; cf., 21, 150). It was Ch√¢u's frank appraisal of the conspiring generals, e.g., D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, that these prospective new rulers were Di·ªám's inferiors, in moral character, education, patriotic standing, and leadership ability.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 199‚Äì204 (telephone at 201; Minh at 201, cf., 208). Di·ªám \\"was a true nationalist and resisted U.S. efforts to turn his administration into a puppet regime\\" (p. 203). Di·ªám provided \\"incorruptible, highly moral leadership\\" (p. 295). About the 1963 coup leaders, Ch√¢u at times could express harsh views. He observed: > Unlike Di·ªám, who had confidence in himself, our current opportunistic > Vietnamese generals in power are insecure men. They fear... that they are > not capable of or qualified for their positions.\\" Ch√¢u with Fermoyle at p. > 278. The Americans staged the coup \\"with a group of generals who would > welcome any power that could provide them with more opportunity for higher > positions and material gains. They are the same opportunists who dealt with > the French... .\\" (Ch√¢u at p. 261.) Ch√¢u also wrote of the generals (at 271), \\"Many, if not most, of our leaders are sincere, honest, and patriotic, but... .\\" They did not have president Di·ªám's \\"training and background\\" and were prone to taking \\"the path of least resistance\\". Career military then often had started as N.C.O.s for the French (cf., p. 116). The coup remains controversial.Nguyen Cong Luan (2012) p. 280. \\"After President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám was slain, no political leader of his caliber could restore the central power... .\\"Sheehan (1988), p. 610: the author critically comments that Ch√¢u had been \\"an ardent Diemist\\". At p. 502: American ambassador Lodge, who had pushed hard for the anti-Diem coup, soon \\"had despaired of the lackadaisical junta that had overthrown Diem and permitted them to be overthrown in turn... \\".FitzGerald (1972). The overthrow of Di·ªám by ARVN generals resulted in \\"the replacement of bad leadership with no leadership at all. The generals stepped into a vacuum of power they could not fill\\". For the next decade the American military would complain about Vietnamese \\"lack of leadership\\" (p. 263, quotes). Ironically, after the 1966 Buddhist crisis, a Vietnamese explained dryly, \\"The Americans don't like the Buddhists for the same reasons they did not like Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. The Buddhists are too Vietnamese for them\\" (p. 285, quote).Colby (1978) pp. 206‚Äì207, 216. Before the coup, several top American leaders, e.g., John McCone and Maxwell Taylor, supported President Di·ªám, some considering him \\"better than anyone on the horizon\\".Colby (1989), p. 158. About the fall of Di·ªám, \\"The leader of the National Liberation Front, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªç, later called it a 'gift from Heaven for us'.\\" Vietnamese Communist representatives in Paris had thought Di·ªám their \\"strongest and most effective opponent\\".Nguyen Duy Hinh & Tran Dinh Tho (1984) pp. 134, 139‚Äì140; \\"finding a better national leader than Diem proved to be totally illusive\\" (quote at 140).Warner (1963) at p. 307 makes the admittedly inexact comparison of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám and Chiang Kai-shek: \\"both Christians and Confucians\\".Yet Prados (2009) p. 60, discusses anti-Di·ªám sentiment, quoting a Vietnamese army general, who joined no coup, but whose \\"original excitement and hope for Mr. Di·ªám vanished.\\" General L√¢m Quang Thi continued, > The problem was, he acted like an emperor. He tolerated no organized > opposition; his critics were harassed or arrested. His decrees became laws. > He gradually transformed South Vietnam into a quasi-police state. Fall (1966) p. 112: A year before the coup, with his communist President Ho Chi Minh listening, Premier Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng said of the southern President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám: > \\"Monsieur Di·ªám's position is quite difficult. He is unpopular, and the more > unpopular he is the more American aid he will require to stay in power. And > the more American aid he receives, the more he will look like a puppet of > the Americans and the less likely he is to win popular support for his side. Ch√¢u arranged to fly immediately back to Da Nang, which remained calm. Yet his sense of honor caused him to persist in his loyalty to the murdered president. His attitude was not welcome among some top generals who led the coup. Under political pressure Ch√¢u resigned as mayor of Da Nang. Nonetheless, Ch√¢u for a while held positions under the new interior minister (and a coup leader), T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, and under the new mayor of Saigon, Duong Ngoc Lam.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 204‚Äì213, Da Nang (204‚Äì209), Dinh (207‚Äì211), Lam (211‚Äì212). Ch√¢u (p. 209) told Dinh, \\"I don't want to appear a turncoat [to Di·ªám], someone who shifts with the wind to save his own hide. That seems shameful to me.\\"Cf., U.S. Dept. of Defense (1971; The New York Times 1971, reprint) at pp. 188, 189, re General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n's late recruitment of General T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh for the coup. Meanwhile, a second coup of January 29, 1964, staged by General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh, succeeded in forcing a further regime change.FitzGerald (1972) p. 247. Joining in the second coup was a younger group of army officers (p. 249). Yet a year later, by February 1965, the \\"end of the Kh√°nh regime left the political situation more confused than ever\\" (p. 260).Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n (1978) pp. 121‚Äì141. For months Kh√°nh held the leading generals of the first coup under arrest, then forced their military retirement. Regarding the war, the American advisors were then \\"more concerned with security in the provinces\\" and in 1964 Ch√¢u was sent back to Ki·∫øn H√≤a as province chief. Returning to a familiar setting, his 'homecoming' went well. Ch√¢u was comforted to leave Saigon, capital of the \\"new 'coup-driven' army, with all its intrigues and politics.\\" Vietnamese generals then took little notice of him, but the American CIA remained interested in Ch√¢u's work. Subsequently, the Minister of Rural Development in Saigon, Nguyen ƒê·ª©c Thang, appointed Ch√¢u as national director of the Pacification Cadre Program in 1965.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012): Ch√¢u's return to Ki·∫øn H√≤a (213‚Äì225), Saigon quote (213), as national director (225).Grant (1991) pp. 287 (national director).Cf., Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n (1978) p. 159 re Thang as pacification minister, and Phoenix. Innovative counterinsurgency In the Vietnam War pacification, a technical term of art,Cf., Grant (1991) p. 113: \\"Pacification was a term the Americans were never happy with... .\\" Alternatives were rural construction and revolutionary development, or simply the other war.Ellsberg (2003) pp. 105‚Äì106. Originally a French term, pacification was still used by the Vietnamese military. Some Americans preferred \\"revolutionary development\\" which term was anathema to local \\"landowning elites\\". So the ministry in Vietnamese was called \\"Rural Construction\\" but translated for Americans as RD. became a nagging source of policy disagreement in the American government between its military establishment and civilian leadership. Initially avoided by the military, later, as merely a low-level professional issue, the Army debated its practical value, i.e., the comparative results obtained by (a) employing counterinsurgency techniques to directly pacify a populated territory, versus (b) the much more familiar techniques of conventional warfare used successfully in Europe, then in Korea. The later strategy sought simply to eliminate the enemy's regular army as a fighting force, after which civic security in the villages and towns was expected to be the normal result. Not considered apparently was the sudden disappearance of guerrilla fighters, who then survived in the countryside with local support. later launching an ambush. From the mid-1950s the American strategy of choice in Vietnam was conventional warfare, a contested decision, considered in hindsight a fatal mistake.Krepinevich (1986), pp. 7‚Äì16, 19‚Äì26; 66, 75. About the mid-1950s U.S. Army, Krepinevich states (at p. 21): > It was easier for the [American] military to envision a Korea-type threat in > [South] Vietnam ‚Äì a cross-border invasion of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN) > by North Vietnam ‚Äì than the insurgency threat which posed a dramatically > different conflict environment than the Army was used to and which it was > unprepared to address. In Vietnam, conventional warfare remained the primary focus of the Army into the mid 1960s (cf., 138, 260).Phillips (2008) pp. xiii, xiv‚Äìxv; 151‚Äì153. The Defense Department and the Army misunderstood the Vietnamese situation, and from the start failed to focus on pacification.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) p. 229. If the \\"nature of the insurgency\\" had been understood by the early 1960s \\"the war would not have escalated to the scale it reached in 1965.\\" CIDG in training, early U.S. Army and CIA effort in remote regions.In 1961, as an auxiliary force, CIBG was set up and trained by U.S. Army Special Forces, first in the Central Highlands; they were paid by CIA. Rural recruits, officered by the ARVN, they numbered 45,000 at their peak (in the mid-1960s). Tucker (2000) at 74‚Äì75.Cf., Valentine (1990) p. 36, re CIDG and CIA in 1960. The Army rebuffed President Kennedy's efforts to develop a strong American counterinsurgency capability in general.Krepinevich (1986), pp. 27‚Äì37 (JFK rebuffed). The Army also declined regarding Vietnam in particular.Cf., Ricks (2012) pp. 219‚Äì220 (in 1961 U.S. Army rejects counterinsurgency and pacification, in favor of conventional warfare), 261 (U.S. Army's earlier misuse as a 'conventional warfare' tactic of the CIA's \\"village defense\\" pacification program in Vietnam), 267‚Äì274 (Marines successfully used small teams in counterinsurgency, occupied villages, and built intelligence networks, but Army in 1965 \\"objected vigorously to the Marine programs\\" at 268‚Äì269, yet both methods criticized at 272).Cassidy (2006) p. 116. Focused on conventional warfare in Europoe, the Army considered the Vietnam War to be an \\"aberration\\" and \\"irrelevant\\" to the Army as an \\"institution\\". Marine Lt. Gen. Victor Krulak, however, in Vietnam early favored pacification and opposed conventional attrition strategy. Yet Krulak had failed to convince first Gen. Westmoreland, then McNamara at Defense, and ultimately President Johnson.Sheehan (1988), pp. 629‚Äì631, 634 (Krulak strategy); 632‚Äì633,636 (failed to convince Westmoreland and Johnson).Cf., Ricks (2012) pp. 267‚Äì274. Krulak and Johnson (268). Marine Lt.Gen. John Cushman twice briefed Westmoreland, without result (p. 267). Ch√¢u, too, spoke with Westmoreland, unsuccessfully.Ch√¢u with Sturdevant (2001) pp. 199‚Äì200. General Westmoreland was one of several VIP military officers to visit Ch√¢u during his second term as governor of Ki·∫øn H√≤a. See section below. The Viet Cong generally avoided fielding regular army units until late in the war. The Viet Cong (supported by the National Liberation Front (NLF) and the North Vietnamese regime), continued through the 1960s to chiefly employ guerrilla warfare in their insurgency to gain political control of South Vietnam.Cf., Summers ([1981]) at pp. 47‚Äì48, 54‚Äì55. Summers describes the changing conflict: the communists began the war against South Vietnam mostly with the tactics of an insurgency using guerrilla forces (1950s, 1960s), yet gained the strategic victory in 1974‚Äì1975 with a conventional attack using regular Army units invading from North Vietnam. Viet Cong tactics included deadly assaults against civilian officials of the Government of South Vietnam (GSV).Pike (1966), pp. 102, 246‚Äì249: targets included village leaders, religious figures, and school teachers (p. 248).Hunt (1995) p. 41, opines that \\"communist terror in the early 1960s had nearly wiped out a generation of local officials.\\"FitzGerald (1972) at 174, writes: \\"Political assassination, after all, formed a basic ingredient of Front strategy... . It \\"did not kill indiscriminately, but carefully calculated... for maximum political effect.\\" The early pacification efforts of Di·ªám were later overtaken by the American war of attrition strategy, as hundreds of thousands of American soldiers with advanced weaponry arrived in 1965 and dominated the battlefield. Yet after several years the \\"other war\\" (pacification) was revived with the initiation of CORDS. By 1967 the military value, as auxiliaries, of American-led pacification teams, became accommodated by the MACV.Hunt (1995) pp. 31‚Äì35 (war of attrition), 35‚Äì42 (GSV pacification efforts), 82‚Äì98 (Office of Civil Operations (OCO) and early CORDS). Earlier under Diem the GSV itself worked at counterinsurgency. Yet pacification sometimes prompted the return of landlords to former Viet Cong- held villages. Then the demand for past rent from resistant peasants could defeat the program's purpose. Hunt (1995) pp. 14‚Äì15.Tucker (2000), \\"Pacification\\", pp. 313‚Äì316; \\"Counterinsurgency Warfare\\", pp. 85‚Äì87.Moyar (1997), pp. 3‚Äì8 (guerrilla and conventional warfare), 35‚Äì46 (pre-Phoenix, e.g., at 36: agrovilles and strategic hamlets); 47‚Äì55 CORDS and IBEX [Intelligence Coordination and Exploitation], Phoenix Program. \\"Di·ªám's successors showed that they could not fight the insurgents as well as he had\\" (p. 39). Some critics view the initial inability of the U.S. Army command to properly evaluate pacification strategy as symptomatic of its global stature and general overconfidence.E.g., Sheehan (1988) pp. 285‚Äì287. Sheehan compares unfavorably the hungry and humble U.S. Army of World War II with that of the Vietnam War. By then \\"the dominant characteristics of the senior leadership of the American armed forces had become professional arrogance, lack of imagination, and moral and intellectual insensitivity.\\"Cf., Ricks (2012) pp. 252‚Äì284, 325‚Äì326. President Johnson himself was suspicious of his military's advice. \\"They're so narrow in their appraisal of everything\\", Ricks at 252 quoting from Goodwin, Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream (1976) p. 252. Ricks at pp. 253‚Äì254 writes that after the war many American Army generals considered the early strategy of \\"attrition, body count, and 'search and destroy'\\" was mistaken. Yet Ricks also narrates events showing that the Army brass in Vietnam fought a war circumscribed by politicians, in which mutual communication could break down (pp. 215, 253, 257‚Äì259).Cf., Fulbright (1966), pp. 15‚Äì18, 106‚Äì108, 132‚Äì138, 185‚Äì186. Civilian direction of American foreign policy in Southeast Asia has also been pointedly criticized. In the meantime, first under Di·ªám, the GSV with participation by the CIA had contrived to improvise and field various responses to the assaults by the Viet Cong. Ch√¢u's contributions to counterinsurgency then were original and significant. Later, heated political controversy would arise over the social ethics and legality of the eventual means developed to \\"pacify\\" the countryside.See section below: \\"CIA and CORDS: redesign\\" re political controversy. In Ki·∫øn H√≤a Province Ki·∫øn H√≤a Province (also called B·∫øn Tre Province) today.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) p. 170. B·∫øn Tre was the provincial capital of Ki·∫øn H√≤a. Ch√¢u served as the province chief (governor) of Ki·∫øn H√≤a Province in the Mekong Delta south of Saigon, 1962‚Äì1963 and 1964‚Äì1965. Ch√¢u had focused \\"his efforts to devise programs to beat the communists at their own game\\", in the description of journalist Zalin Grant. At the time Ki·∫øn H√≤a Province was considered \\"one of the most communist-dominated\\" in South Vietnam. In the event, his efforts netted surprising results. Ch√¢u's innovative methods and practices proved able to win over the hearts and minds of the people, eventually turning the tide against Viet Cong activity in Ki·∫øn H√≤a.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), Chapter 14 \\"In Kien Hoa province, the VC 'Cradle of Revolution' (1962)\\" at pp. 170‚Äì184; Ch√¢u's Consensus Grievance (CG) program (179‚Äì183).Grant (1991) p. 25 (quotes: \\"his efforts\\" and \\"communist-dominated\\").Cf. Fall (1966) pp. 142 n2, 143 (map). Three provinces of the Mekong delta (B·∫øn Tre, Vƒ©nh Long, Tr√† Vinh) were considered in 1955 by the journalist Fall to be semi-autonomous \\"Catholic bishoprics\\". > \\"Give me a budget that equals the cost of only one American helicopter\\", > Ch√¢u would say, \\"and I'll give you a pacified province. With that much money > I can raise the standard of living of the rice farmers, and government > officials in the province can be paid enough so that they won't think it > necessary to steal.\\"Grant (1991) p. 25 (quote: \\"Give me a budget\\").Cf., > O'Donnell (2001) pp. 219‚Äì223 in Ki·∫øn H√≤a: Ch√¢u's personal involvement in the > selection and training of small teams (221), interviewing villagers, > complaint-and-action techniques to weed out abusive officials, social- > economic projects to improve farming, schools, and health (221‚Äì222, 223). From his own experiences with guerrilla tactics and strategy, and drawing on his recent investigations of the Civil Guard, Ch√¢u developed a novel blend of procedures for counterinsurgency warfare. President Di·ªám encouraged and supported his experimental approaches to pacification teams and his efforts to implement them in the field.Valentine (1990) p. 71‚Äì72. In Ki·∫øn H√≤a Province, Ch√¢u began to personally train several different kinds of civil-military teams in the skills needed to put the procedures into practice. The purpose of the teams was to first identify and then combat those communist party cadres in the villages who provided civil support for the armed guerrillas in the countryside. The party apparatus of civilian cadres thus facilitated 'the water' in which the \\"Viet Cong fish\\" could swim. Ch√¢u's teams were instructed how to learn from villagers about the details and identities of their security concerns, and then to work to turn the allegiance or to neutralize the communist party apparatus, which harbored the VC fighters.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) pp. 170‚Äì175 (Ch√¢u's first survey of Ki·∫øn H√≤a); 166, 228, 270 (fish and water).Cf., re fish analogy, Griffith (1940; 1961), pp. 1‚Äì34 at 8. These quasi-civilian networks, which could be urban as well as rural, were called by counterinsurgency analysts the Viet Cong Infrastructure (VCI), which formed a \\"shadow government\\" in South Vietnam.Moyar (1997) at pp. 9‚Äì34 (Viet Cong's shadow government).Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) p. 166 (VCI), 174 (\\"shadow government\\").Cf., Pike (1966) at pp. 77‚Äì84 (NLF organized as \\"communist- front\\"), 99‚Äì104 (violent attacks), 114‚Äì118 (farmer associations, People's Revolutionary Party). The Viet Cong apparatus was constructed slowly, year by year, village by village, so that by the mid-1960s it permeated the entire countryside of South Vietnam. When working as an instructor of the Civil Guard, Ch√¢u's innovations had already drawn the interest of several high-level American military officers. Among the first to visit him here in Ki·∫øn H√≤a was the counterinsurgency expert, Colonel Edward Lansdale.\\"Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), prior American interest (p. 166), Lansdale's visit (p. 183). Visitors included the Robert Thompson, an expert on guerrilla warfare.Grant (1991), pp. 111‚Äì113 (Lansdale); 26 (Ch√¢u and Lansdale).Cf., Lansdale (1972; 1991), e.g., Lansdale's 1954 arrival in Vietnam at pp. 128‚Äì142. Lansdale, ostensibly an Air Force officer, often doubled as a CIA agent. Cecil B. Currey, \\"Introduction\\" p. xi.Prados (2003, 2009), pp. 64‚Äì65: Lansdale in the 1950s headed the Saigon Military Mission (psywar and political action), which functioned as a second CIA station in Vietnam.Karnow (1986), at pp. 220‚Äì221, gives an ambivalent introduction to Lansdale, indicating why the conventional Army would remain skeptical of him. Later General Westmoreland, commander of MACV, came to listen to Ch√¢u's views, but without positive result.Ch√¢u with Sturdevant (2001) pp. 199‚Äì200. Ch√¢u here comments that regarding pacification Westmoreland \\"seemed to lack a basic understanding of what the war in South Vietnam was all about\\" nor learning it.Phillips (2008) p. 256 re Westmoreland's visit to Ch√¢u. Eventually, CIA officer Stewart Methven began working directly with Ch√¢u. Pacification methods were adopted by CIA Saigon station chief Peer De Silva, and supported by his superior William Colby who then led CIA's Far East Division.Grant (1991), re Methven and Ch√¢u: pp. 171‚Äì172, 173, 174.Prados (2003, 2009). Ch√¢u's innovations, CIA station chief De Salvo and officer Methven: pp. 139‚Äì140. The CIA's Colby as earlier chief of station in Saigon (p. 69), later division chief (p. 128). Colby and early pacification: e.g., pp. 144‚Äì145, 179‚Äì180.Cf., Valentine (1990) at 49‚Äì50: American \\"Lansdale disciples\\" and John Paul Vann, a friend of Ch√¢u.O'Donnell (2001) pp. 212, 213, 219 re United States Operations Mission (USOM) and Ch√¢u in Ki·∫øn H√≤a. Census Grievance program Ch√¢u first began to experiment with counterinsurgency tactics while commander of the Civil Guard and Self- Defense Forces in the eastern Mekong delta. President Di·ªám here backed his work.Valentine (1990) 71‚Äì72. A major spur to his development of a new approach was the sorry state of South Vietnamese intelligence about the Viet Cong. Apparently the communists cadres already knew most GSV agents who were attempting to spy on them. The VC either fed them misinformation, converted them into double agents, or compromised or killed those few GSV agents who were effective. Ch√¢u had to start again, by trial-and-error practice, to construct better village intelligence. Not only, but also better use of information to deliver effective security for the peasant villagers.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), p. 179.Yet cf. Moyar (1997), who at p. 35 credits Di·ªám's Cong An, a \\"direct descendant of the colonial-era secret police\\", with the elimination of \\"most of the communist infrastructure\\" existing in the South during the mid-1950s. In doing so Ch√¢u combined his idea of village census takers (better intelligence and better use of it) with that of \\"people's action teams\\" (PAT) to form a complete pacification program.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), p. 235 re disagreement with CIA over composition of PATs. \\"Ch√¢u apparently had what the Americans with their splintered programs lacked: an overall plan.\\"Grant (1991), p. 26, p. 172 (quote).Cf., Krepinevich (1986). Krepinevich presents a bleak picture of an American Army that was \\"unprepared\\" for the style of fighting required in Vietnam (p. 55). Regarding the development of specific counterinsurgency strategy and tactics, in late 1964 American military doctrine comprised only a \\"patchwork formulation\\" that indicated the Army was \\"going through the motions\\" of churning out work \\"it did not really understand\\" (p. 40). NLF or the Viet Cong In Ki·∫øn H√≤a Province, Ch√¢u begin to train five types of specialized teams: census grievance (interviews), social development, open arms (Viet Cong recruitment), security, and counterterror. First, the \\"census grievance\\" teams gathered from villagers local information, political and social; such intelligence operations were \\"critical to the success of the program\\" and included social justice issues. To compose the 'census grievance' teams, he carefully selected from the Civil Guard individuals for small squads of three to five. \\"They interviewed every member of the village or hamlet in which they were operating every day without exception.\\" Second, in follow-up responses that used this information, the \\"social development\\" teams set priorities and worked to achieve village improvements: bridges, wells, schools, clinics. Third, were the \\"open arms\\" teams [Vietnamese: Chieu Hoi],Nguyen Cong Luan (2012), p. 304. Chieu Hoi is a Sino-Viet term that means \\"calling the enemy to return to the right cause\\". Starting on January 1, 1967, the author Luan was ranking commander of the national Chieu Hoi program, in charge of the Reception Directorate (p. 305, cf., 434). 160,000 communists 'defected' to Chieu Hoi-type programs from 1962 to 1975; included were hundreds of army officers (p. 342). which used village intelligence to counter Viet Cong indoctrination, persuading those supporting the Viet Cong, such as family members and part-time soldiers, that \\"it was in their interest to join the government side.\\" Fourth, a \\"security\\" team composed of \\"six to twelve armed men\\" might work with ten villages at a time, in order to provide protection for the other pacification teams and their efforts. Fifth, the \\"counterterror\\" teams were a \\"weapon of last resort.\\"Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 180‚Äì181 (quotes).Cf., Andrad√© (1990) at 44. Andrad√© discusses the CIA's incorporation by 1966 of a \\"new touch\\", i.e., the \\"Census/Grievance\\" program. Here the author does not mention Tran Ngoc Ch√¢u. A merit of the interview procedure was said to be that, as every villager was regularly interviewed, the Viet Cong could not easily determine who might be 'fingering' them.Valentine (1990) at pp. 55 (Ch√¢u's \\"innovative census grievance teams\\" in Ki·∫øn H√≤a), 71‚Äì72 (Ch√¢u's \\"pet project\\" the \\"Census Grievance\\"), 73‚Äì74 (Ch√¢u may have adopted elements of the \\"Family Census program\\" used by Thompson against the insurgency in Malaya).Cf. Moyar (1997), p. 36 re the \\"open arms\\" teams. Moyar states, \\"In early 1963, at the suggestion of the CIA, Di·ªám created the Chieu Hoi program, which offered amnesty to members of the Viet Cong... .\\" Without mention of Ch√¢u, Moyar also writes (at p. 37): > One innovation of the CIA was the Static Census Grievance program, which > sent people into the villages to survey one member of each family in order > to identify the villagers' grievances against the government and to gather > intelligence. Moyar continues (at 37‚Äì38) with other \\"CIA initiatives\\" which follow pacification techniques similar or parallel to Ch√¢u's, e.g., the \\"Armed Propaganda Team\\", the \\"Province Interrogation Center\\", and the highly touted \\"Revolutionary Development (RD) cadres program, which imitated the Viet Cong\\" as well as \\"Counter-Terror Teams\\".Phillips (2008) pp. 131‚Äì132: Ch√¢u's innovative Census Grievance program described. From the intelligence that was obtained from the entire Census Grievance program, \\"we were able to build a rather clear picture of Viet Cong influence in a given area.\\" Identified were people or whole families supporting the Viet Cong out of fear or coercion, as well as at the other end \\"hard-core VC who participated and directed the most virulent activities.\\" Evidence about hard-core VC was thoroughly screened and \\"confirmed at the province level.\\" Only in the presence of active \\"terrorists\\" would the 'counterterror' team arrive to \\"arrest\\" the suspect for interrogation, and where \\"not feasible... the ultimate saction [was] invoked: assassination.\\" Ch√¢u emphasized the care and skill which must be given to each step in order to succeed in such a delicate political task. He notes his negative opinion about the somewhat similar Phoenix Program that was later established, inferring that mistakes, and worse, eventually corrupted its operation, which became notorious to its critics.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at p. 181 (quotes); at p. 408 n11; cf., p. 332 (Phoenix distinguished and disapproved).Tucker (2000), \\"Phoenix Program\\", p. 329. Phoenix was directed by CORDS and included police and other forces of the Republic of Vietnam, the CIA and the American military. The country people were naturally very suspicious at first, and reluctant to respond to any questions asked by the \\"census grievance\\" teams. Each interview was set to last five minutes. Gradually, however, the people \\"began to see that we were serious about stopping abuses not only by the Viet Cong but by the government officials and the military as well.\\" Villagers made complaints about thing like sexual abuse and thieving. Charges were investigated, and if proven true, the official or tribal chief was punished by loss of job or by prison. Once in a village the Civil Guard was found to have faked Viet Cong raids in order to steal fish from a family pond. The family was reimbursed. People slowly became convinced of the sincerity of the pacification teams and then \\"rallied to the government side.\\"Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) at pp. 181‚Äì183 (quotes). Ch√¢u earlier had noted that local politicians can negatively interfere (p. 165).Cf., Grant (1991), pp. 22‚Äì23, 171, 172‚Äì173, 286. Such success carried risk, as \\"the census grievance teams became prime targets for assassination by the Viet Cong.\\" Information was key. \\"As our intelligence grew in volume and accuracy, Viet Cong members no longer found it easy to blend into the general populace during the day and commit terrorist acts by night.\\" The 'open arms' teams had started to win back Viet Cong supporters, who might then \\"convince family members to leave the VC ranks.\\" Other Viet Cong fighters began to fear being captured or killed by the 'counterterror' teams. During Ch√¢u's first year a thousand \\"active Viet Cong guerrillas fled\\" Ki·∫øn H√≤a Province.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), pp. 183 (quotes); cf., 165 (local politicians). Some disputed the comparative success of Ch√¢u and his methods,Sheehan (1988) at p. 610. \\"While he was no more successful when the results were counted than other province chiefs..., Ch√¢u was the exception in that he seriously tried to pacify his province.\\" but his reputation spread as an innovator who could get results.Phillips (2008) p. 140: In Kien Hoa, despite historical Communist Party entrenchment, Colonel Ch√¢u was gradually winning support.\\"Valentine (1990) at 55. \\"[D]eveloped in Kien Hoa Province by Tran Ngoc Chau [the] innovative census grievance programs were proving quite successful.\\"Prados (2003, 2009), pp. 139‚Äì140: counterinsurgency innovations by \\"a dynamic Vietnamese officer, Tran Ngoc Chau\\". As national director Ch√¢u's operational program for counterinsurgency, the 'Census Grievance', was observed and studied by interested South Vietnamese and American officials. Many of his tactical elements were adopted by the CIA and later used by CORDS in the creation of the controversial Phoenix Program. Formerly of the CIA and then as head of CORDS which supervised Phoenix, William Colby \\"knew that Ch√¢u had probably contributed more to pacification than any other single Vietnamese.\\"Grant (1991) at p. 302 (quote re Colby on Ch√¢u). Grant opines at p. 161: > William Colby was the most effective American political action operative to > serve in Vietnam. ... Like Ch√¢u, Colby also realized that the most important > target in the country was not the guerrillas fighters but the political and > administrative apparatus of the Viet Cong... which he called the Viet Cong > Infrastructure (VCI). Yet Ch√¢u became highly critical of what the Phoenix Program eventually became, in effect disowning it. See section, \\"CIA and CORDS: redesign\\". may reflect the Qi√°n Kwai (\\"Heaven\\" trigram) of the I Ching. of the Republic of Vietnam > Ch√¢u did not want to kill the Viet Cong guerrillas. He wanted to win them > over to the government side. After all most of them were young men, often > teenagers, poorly educated, and not really communists....Grant (1991) at 22 > (quote: Ch√¢u winning over the guerrillas).Cf., [Thich] Nhat Hanh (1967), > \\"The war has consistently seen more civilians killed than Viet Cong.\\" Cited > by Buttinger (1977), p. 84. Ch√¢u developed ideas, e.g., about subverting the semi-civilian networks that supported the Viet Cong, that were little understood by many American military. However, a small group of dissident officers, often led by Colonel Lansdale, appreciated Ch√¢u's work in pacification. These officers, and also CIA agents, opposed the Pentagon's conventional Vietnam strategy of attrition warfare and instead persisted in advocating counterinsurgency methods.Cf., Krepinevich (1986) pp. 27‚Äì37. Most Army leaders were then convinced that a war of attrition using regular army units would win in Vietnam. In the early 1960s counterinsurgency, although pushed by President Kennedy, was often approached by the Army brass as a paper controversy initiated by ill-informed, civilian politicians.Grant (1991) pp. 26, 332 (Lansdale); at p. 129: > Instead of preparing the South Vietnamese to face a communist-inspired > guerrilla war inside their country at the village level, the Americans > trained them to oppose an invasion of conventional forces from North > Vietnam. Compare: United States Dept. of the Army (2006; 2007). The dissidents understood the worth of Ch√¢u's appeal to the rural people of Vietnam. As a consequence, over time \\"a number of the programs Ch√¢u had developed in his province were started countrywide.\\"Grant (1991) at p. 26 (quote re Ch√¢u's programs countrywide). A major motivation for Ch√¢u's approach to counterinsurgency was his nationalism. He favored Vietnamese values, that could inspire the government's pacification efforts and gain the allegiance of the farmers and villagers. Accordingly, Ch√¢u voiced some criticism of the 1965 'take-over' of the Vietnam War by the enormously powerful American military. He remembered approvingly that the former President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám (1901‚Äì63) had warned him that it was the Vietnamese themselves who had to enlist their people and manage their war to victory.Cf., \\"Interview with Tran Ngoc Chau\\" circa 1981‚Äì1982, WGBH Open Vault , transcript of video interview.Cf., Karnow (1984): In 1964 the Johnson administration \\"took over the management of the war\\" (p. 378), choosing to \\"Americanize\\" it (p. 386); cf., p. 342 (America's \\"strategic goals\\" redefined in 1964).Cf., Komer (1986) at 14, who describes another view. The original American policy was the employment of the French, and later of the South Vietnamese, as proxies against the communists. Only when North Vietnam by the mid 1960s, substantially infiltrated its forces south to seize control, did America directly intervene with massive military \\"as a last resort\\" because South Vietnam was on the \\"brink of collapse\\". Yet American policy sought to avoid \\"any risk of a direct confrontation with Peking or Moscow\\". Later Komer (at p. 24) describes \\"the 1965‚Äì1968 period of direct U.S. intervention and escalation, in which we largely pushed the South Vietnamese to one side and tried to win the war for them.\\" Ch√¢u's insistence that Vietnamese officers and agents take leadership positions in the field, and that Americans stay in the background, agreed with Lansdale's view of Vietnamese participation.Cf., Lansdale (1972; 1991), e.g., pp. 191, 233‚Äì234.Prados (2003, 2009) at 223: \\"Ch√¢u believed [the pacification program] could not succeed if identified as a CIA, or even an American, program.\\" In 1966 in Saigon the new interior minister in charge of pacification, General Nguyen ƒê·ª©c Thang, whose American advisor was Lansdale, appointed Ch√¢u as national director of the Pacification Cadre Program in Saigon.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), as national director pp. 225, 227, 237. Ch√¢u hoped the program could help \\"revolutionize Vietnamese society\\" (p. 238).Grant (1991), p. 287 (Lansdale as the General Thang's senior advisor).Valentine (1990) at pp. 71‚Äì72. According to CIA agent Donohue, when Thang had asked for a Vietnamese to run it, Donohue replied, \\"Ch√¢u\\". After Lansdale arrived, Thang \\"advocated transferring the entire Revolutionary Development program to the Defense Ministry\\" thus attenuating CIA centrality. Later Ch√¢u became marginalized by CIA administration of the V≈©ng T√†u training center.Hunt (1995) pp. 36‚Äì37. Maj. Gen. Thang was an ally of K·ª≥. \\"No single South Vietnamese official since Di·ªám's brother Nhu had exercised such broad authority over pacification.\\" In Jan. 1968 Thang, frustrated by Pres. Thi·ªáu, resigned from the Joint General Staff. Ch√¢u cautiously welcomed the challenging assignment. He realized that Lansdale, Lt. Colonel Vann, and others (dissidents at CIA) had pushed his selection and wanted him to succeed in the job. Unfortunately Ch√¢u was ultimately not given the discretion and scope of authority he sought in order to properly lead the national pacification efforts in the direction he advocated. He met opposition from the Americans, i.e., the CIA Saigon leadership, and from his own government.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), at p. 225 (help from Lansdale, Vann); at pp. 234, 237, 244, 266 (difficulty re Thang); 244 (CIA troubles). Ch√¢u laments (at p. 228): \\"Little did I realize that it wasn't just the enemy that was capable of sabotage. I had no inkling of the political infighting and backstabbing that would complicate my new job.\\"Prados (2009) p. 128. Following their coup against Di·ªám, the generals heading the Vietnamese military government became even more reliant on their American allies and the CIA. His apparent agreement with the CIA station chief on \\"technical facets\\" fell short. Ch√¢u later wrote: > We never got to the cardinal point I considered so essential: devotion to > the nationalist image and resulting motivation of the cadres. ... Such > nationalistic motivation could only be successful if the program appeared to > be run by Vietnamese; the CIA would have to operate remotely, covertly, and > sensitively, so that the project would be seen and felt to be a totally > Vietnamese program, without foreign influence.Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012) p. > 232 (quote). The CIA station chief Gordon Jorgenson \\"obviously did not grasp > that point\\" (p. 233), rather he had wanted Ch√¢u \\"to work more closely with > the military\\" and \\"to coordinate with other U.S. agencies\\" (p. 231). Ch√¢u's > discussions with Jorgenson's assistant, Tom Donohue, also failed to reach > agreement (pp. 234‚Äì235). At the CIA compound in Saigon its leadership, joined there by other American officials from various government agencies, were apparently already satisfied with their approach to running pacification operations in Vietnam.Valentine (1991) pp. 71‚Äì72. Valentine relies here on CIA agent Tom Donohue, who characterized as \\"forced\\" Ch√¢u's appointment to be national director. Donohue later became deputy to George Carver as SAVA (special assistant for Vietnamese affairs) within the CIA (p. 159).Grant (1991) opines at p. 287, \\"With Ch√¢u in charge, the CIA men knew they would have to salute him, not vice versa.\\" Ch√¢u then appeared to lack bureaucratic support to implement his innovations.Cf., Sheehan (1988), p. 612: e.g., Lansdale's current mission to Vietnam had been undermined in a bureaucratic shuffle.Cf., Ellsberg (2003) p. 105. The CIA's Saigon station chief felt threatened by Lansdale's mystique. Lansdale was then \\"outmaneuvered bureaucratically\\".Ricks (2012): the U.S. Army then generally opposed a counterinsurgency focus, at pp. 261‚Äì262 (per CIA, and Lt.Col. Vann), 262‚Äì266, 269‚Äì271, 273‚Äì274 (Gen. Westmoreland), and U.S. Marines). Ch√¢u relocated to V≈©ng T√†u (a peninsula south of Saigon) in order to take charge of its National Training Center. A large institution (5,000 trainees for various pacification programs), until 1966 it had been run by Captain Le Xuan Mai. Mai also worked for the CIA and was a ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát proponent. Ch√¢u wanted to change the curriculum, but his difficulties with Mai led to a long and bitter struggle before the deceptive Mai left. The dispute came to involve Lt. Colonel Vann, Ambassador William J. Porter, the CIA station chief Gordon Jorgenson, pacification minister Thang, and Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥. During the personality and political dispute, which grew in complexity, Ch√¢u sensed that he had \\"lost CIA support.\\"Ch√¢u with Fermoyle (2012), at V≈©ng T√†u (239‚Äì247); Mai (241‚Äì244, 246); K·ª≥ (244); Ch√¢u quote (244).Grant (1991) pp. 286‚Äì289 (V≈©ng T√†u).Prados (2003, 2009) at 184‚Äì185 (Ch√¢u and CIA control of National Training Center at V≈©ng T√†u, and Vietnamese demands).Sheehan (1988) pp. 611‚Äì613 (Mai, Ch√¢u, Vann, Porter, Jorgenson). Ultimately, Ch√¢u resigned from the army to enter politics, which had been refashioned under the terms of the new constitution.Valentine, The Phoenix Program (1990), re Ch√¢u: at pp. 71‚Äì72 (V≈©ng T√†u), p. 159 (National Assembly). The CIA had brought in \\"another talented Vietnamese officer, Nguyen Be\\" who, after working alongside Ch√¢u, \\"took over the V≈©ng T√†u center\\" after Ch√¢u left. According to journalist Zalin Grant, Be was later given credit by CIA officials (e.g., by Colby) in written accounts as \\"the imaginative force\\" instead of Ch√¢u, who was \\"conveniently forgotten\\".Grant (1991) p. 289 (quotes). Lansdale encouraged Ch√¢u to enter politics. Colby's 1986 book did spotlight \\"an imaginative provincial chief\\" in the Delta, but failed to name him.Cf., Colby (1986) pp. 232‚Äì233, 262 (re Nguyen Be). Colby went to state: > The chief \\"started a program of sending teams to the area's villages to > interview the inhabitants about their greivances and used the information to > correct local abuses and failings. Once the villagers were convinced that > the process produced results, the teams proceeded to [ask] about local > Communist activities and identities to help the province's intelligence > service to combat the Viet Cong infrastructure. This program too spread > gradually to other areas, thanks to CIA's support.\\" Colby (1986) pp. 32‚Äì33. > CIA & CORDS: redesign Phoenix Program, Vietnamese patch Civil > Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS), an American > agency, was conceived in 1967 by Robert Komer, who was selected by President > Johnson to supervise the pacification efforts in Vietnam.

Everyone talked about it but actually making the arrangements was a dangerous business. ... A host of unsavory elements discovered they could profit from what rapidly turned into a mass movement. ... The seas were infested with pirates, and beyond the pirates lay a string of squalid refugee camps... . ¬∂ Escape was truly a decision that could only be made out of desperation.Truong Nhu Tang (1985) pp. 292‚Äì293. Tang and his wife escaped from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam by boat in 1978, arriving in Paris six months later (pp. 296, 309). > > The new Communist regime began to question Buddhist monks and laity about > their loyalty to its official ideology.

Due to its geographic features and climate, the Japanese temperate rainforest is very different from other temperate rainforests in the world. The islands in the Japanese archipelago comprise about 1/400 of the world‚Äôs land. The islands are located on a latitude that is normally dry; desert can be found elsewhere in the world at this latitude. However, the oceans surrounding Japan provide enough precipitation to maintain a temperate rainforest. General description The Japanese temperate rainforest can be classified into three types: the warm temperate zone found in the southern islands and lower elevations in the north, the cool temperate zone found in the northern islands and higher elevations in the south, and the subalpine forest in the higher elevations of northern Honshu and Hokkaido. The distribution of the Japanese temperate rainforest is also highly dependent on altitude; one may see all of three types of temperate rainforest on the higher mountains such as Mt. Fuji or Mt. Miyanouradake. Climate The climate of this region is warm and wet. The mean annual temperature is 6 ‚Äì 13 ¬∞C in the cool temperate zone and 13 ‚Äì 23 ¬∞C in the warm temperate zone. Annual precipitation is 1,200 ‚Äì 1,800 mm. Some regions have an annual precipitation of more than 2,800 mm. The precipitation pattern of cool and warm temperate zones is almost opposite: the southern warm temperate rainforest has higher precipitation in summer and less precipitation in winter, and the northern cool temperate rainforest has lower precipitation in summer and higher in winter with the snowfall. High precipitation is caused by oceanic circulation and the rain shadow effect. Summer typhoons from the tropics bring warm; moist air to the southern islands, especially on the Pacific Ocean side. Westerly from Siberian high and Tsushima Current cause heavy snowfall on the Sea of Japan side of northern Japan. Flora The Japanese temperate rainforest is home to about 5300 plant species, 40 percent of which are unique to Japan. The Japanese archipelago was not influenced by the glacier extension in the last ice age; therefore, it provided refugia for many species. Also, there is no dry, desert area within the islands; thus, flora moved fluently between north and south after the last ice age. In addition, the Japanese islands are isolated, reducing immigration of organisms from the Eurasian continent. The subalpine (cold) temperate rainforests are dominated by tsuga and fir. Veitch‚Äôs fir (Abies veitchii), Maries‚Äô fir (Abies mariesii) and northern Japanese hemlock are commonly seen. Also, Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis), Thujopsis (also called hiba) can be found there. Other than those trees, broad-leaf trees such as Japanese beech (Fagus crenata) and oak are co- dominant canopy trees in this area. The understory is dominated by the bamboo Sasa veitchii in most lower elevation sites in western Hokkaido. Ferns, sedges (Carex), and shrubs are co-dominant understory species in this area. The cool temperate rainforest is dominated by Japanese beech (Fagus crenata). Also, Marie's fir, (Abies mariesii), Pinus pumila, oak (Quercus crispula), and Japanese cypress are commonly seen in the cool temperate zone. The understory is dominated by another bamboo species called Chisimazasa (Sasa kurilensis); willow and shrubs such as (Camellia rusticana) are also common in this zone. The warm temperate rainforest is dominated by Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria), Japanese stone oak (Lithocarpus edulis), and Castanopsis sieboldii. Trochodendron, Isu tree (Distylium racemosum), oak (Quercus crispula), and Machilus thunbergii are co-dominant trees in the warm temperate zone. The understory is dominated by another Sasa species called moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), and Rhododendron, and Rhododendron subg. Hymenanthes. The warm temperate rainforest is home to a great diversity of lichen and mosses due to the warm temperature and high precipitation. Fauna Temperate rainforests, especially old-growth forests, provide quality habitat for many species, including natural monument animals or those on the IUCN Red List‚Äîspecies such as the black woodpecker, Japanese black bear, Japanese dormouse, Japanese giant salamander, Japanese serow, Japanese macaque, Japanese golden eagle, sika deer, Japanese grass lizard, and Japanese rat snake. Larger mammals, such as sika deer and Japanese macaque, are commonly seen in all of the temperate zones, but most amphibians and small mammals are unique to each zone. Some species, such as the black woodpecker, live in only old-growth forests and the ongoing loss of their habitat is a serious problem for these species. Historical usage Most of the Japanese temperate rainforest has been logged and used as fuel and building materials over time. Before industrial development, people lived with the forest; they respected the forest and mountains. Mountain worship and mountain asceticism have been very common in Japan through the ages. However, industry and war have forced people to cut the forest. The natural old-growth forest has declined rapidly with economic development and the government's policies. Some areas are turned into plantation forest (secondary forest) of Japanese cedar, Quercus serrate, and sawtooth oak (Quercus acutissime). These forests are known as Satoyama and were well-managed until the government changed its policies again. Takeuchi explains Satoyama as ‚Äúsecondary woodlands and grassland near human settlements that have traditionally used these lands as coppices and meadows for fuel, fertilizer, and fodder.‚Äù Increased importing of fossil fuel and timber changed the value of Satoyama in the 1960s. The Japanese forest industry was reduced and people lost interest in forest management and timber harvesting. The population‚Äôs aging and loss of timber jobs caused a population decrease in a rural area, which made it difficult to maintain the Satoyama area. Today, however, society‚Äôs attention is being pulled back to the function of Satoyama and people have started to maintain the forest again. Disturbance and conservation Common disturbances in Japanese temperate rainforests are triggered by typhoons that have a strong influence on both the forests and human populations. Typhoons cause trees to fall as well as floods and landslides. Although some trees falling is a normal part of the forest lifecycle, large numbers of trees falling all at once can alter or damage the ecosystem. Other recent concerns include damage by animals. Insect infestation and sika deer foraging have become big issues. Infestations by insects have increased rapidly since the 1980s, especially in the last decade, and have impacted the forestry industry. The sika deer's foraging has a less direct impact on the forest itself; however, it represents about 60% of all damage from animals. The deer also eat seedlings, which increases the risk of future canopy decline. Occasionally, sika deer attack orchards in search of food; this may suggest overpopulation of sika deer, possibly due to human impact on their habitat. Ongoing losses from land conversion and climate change also represent serious threats to the conservation of Japanese temperate rainforests.

It was established in 1990, and became fully affiliated to the International Rugby Board (IRB) in 2012. The ASRU is also a full member of the Federation of Oceania Rugby Unions (FORU), which is the regional governing body for rugby in Oceania. It was chaired by Republican politician Te'o J. Fuavai for several decades. History Rugby union has been played in American Samoa since the 1920s, but no governing body existed for the sport for more than 60 years thereafter. When American football was introduced to high schools in the 1970s it became the dominant game, while rugby union was only played in village competitions. The ASRU was formally incorporated in 1990, but it took more than 20 years before the union applied for full membership of the IRB in 2011. The Executive Council of the IRB granted American Samoa full membership in 2012. As of 2015 American Samoa's Rugby team has been ranked 102nd best team in the world, therefore making it the worst team in the world. National teams American Samoa's national team, known as the Talavalu, has not competed in a Rugby World Cup but has competed at the South Pacific Games, including winning a silver medal for rugby 15s in 1991.

She was sentenced to life imprisonment but paroled after 15 years. During her time in prison she escaped once and evaded recapture for a week. It is suspected that she killed her first husband, Robert Gibson, as well. She was \\"considered one of the most daring woman criminals in the country,\\" earning the nickname \\"feminine Bluebeard.\\" History Green and her childhood sweetheart, Gibson, eloped on March 14, 1908 at Covington, Kentucky, and moved to Cleveland where he worked as a teacher while she became a writer for a newspaper. The couple came up with a get-rich-quick scheme where they travelled from town to town, writing and selling books of local historic areas. Their plan failed. While in Huntsville, Missouri, Gibson became ill with an unusual illness. He died March 18, 1920, leaving Clara a widow and the sole beneficiary of a $3,000 life insurance policy. A few months after her first husband's death, Green met and married Frank Carl on September 14, 1920, with the impression that he was wealthy. This was a tumultuous relationship, and at one point Mrs. Carl filed a complaint for divorce against her husband in the Hancock Circuit Court. When asked by Mrs. Lizzie Maynard what her grounds for divorce were, Clara replied that \\"if the law did not provide a way there was always some way.\\" In order to get her to drop the divorce lawsuit, Frank made her the sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy, worth $2,000. In 1921, Clara and Frank invited Frank's elderly father, Alonzo Carl, 85, to come live with them in Philadelphia, Indiana. According to Frank's brother, Herman Carl, his father was in good health when he went to live with the couple. Like Clara's first husband, Alonzo became gravely ill by an unknown illness and died in August 1921. Expecting property from her father-in-law, Clara was furious to find that it had been given to her husband's brother-in-law Dr. Iles. Two months later, Frank was dead, suffering the same illness. The day after her husband's funeral, Clara asked Herman to meet with her to discuss obtaining Alonzo's property from Dr. Iles. Her suspicious actions aroused skepticism among her neighbors who demanded an investigation. Frank and Alonzo's bodies were exhumed, revealing that each man had enough arsenic in his system \\"'to kill a dozen men,' according to the prosecutor.\\" Clara was arrested and charged in January 1922. During her trial, Miss Rhoda Loehr testified that in July 1921, Clara bought arsenic citing that \\"neighborhood cats had been stealing her chickens [and] she said she wanted to kill the cats.\\" Evidence of arsenic in her second husband and father-in-law revealed this to be true. An investigation into her first husband's death revealed the same results. Clara was found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to life in prison at the Indiana Women's Prison at Indianapolis. She was \\"considered one of the most daring woman criminals in the country\\" earning the nickname \\"feminine Bluebeard.\\" While in prison, Clara made a daring and cunning escape in early October 1925. She was assigned outdoor work due to ill health and became a \\"trusty,\\" earning the trust of prison guards after three years of good behavior. Clara was assigned to feeding the prison-yard chickens. One evening, she climbed up one of the chicken coops, hopped the prison wall and escaped. She evaded police for about a week before her re-capture. At aged 54, Clara was paroled on May 26, 1937, 15 years after she was convicted of murder.

In 1874, a single Cape gauge saddle-tank locomotive with a 0-4-0 wheel arrangement was placed in service by the contractors to the Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage Railway Company for the construction of railway lines into the interior. When construction work was completed, the locomotive was taken onto the roster of the Midland System of the Cape Government Railways.C.G.R. Numbering Revised, Article by Dave Littley, SA Rail May‚ÄìJune 1993, pp. 94-95.Pioneer, Little Bess & Mliss Manufacturer In 1874, a third Cape gauge locomotive was delivered through the London agents W. Bailey Hawkins & Company to the contractors to the Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage Railway Company in Port Elizabeth. The locomotive, built by Manning Wardle & Company and dispatched from the builders on 10 March 1874, was of a smaller design than the earlier two locomotives of 1873.Railway History of South Africa no. 2 - Early Locomotives of the Cape Government Railway, Article by Leith Paxton, The Uloliwe, Vol 4 no 1, January 2013, pp. 62-63.Harman, Fred W. (no date shown). The Locomotives Built By Manning Wardle & Company - Volume 3 - Broad Gauge & Works List. Century Locoprints. Characteristics The locomotive was a Manning Wardle Class B engine with diameter coupled wheels and cylinders with a bore and stroke. Service Work on railway expansion from Port Elizabeth into the interior was already underway in 1874. The locomotive was put to work as construction engine on the northern mainline which was being built northwards from Swartkops via Barkly Bridge, Addo, Alicedale and Cookhouse to Cradock.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 12. At some stage around April 1876, when construction work was completed to Sandflats between Coerney and Alicedale, the locomotive, along with six other contractor's locomotives, was taken over from the contractors by the Cape Government Railways and numbered M14 on the Midland System. In 1877, when Swallow's Cutting was being excavated near Middleton on the section north of Alicedale, the locomotive was transported to the construction site by government bullock cart. This line reached Cookhouse in 1880.p. 144 of \\"Uitenhage Past and Present\\" Engine Mliss Reference has been made in literature to a locomotive named Mliss. In an Uitenhage centenary publication, the first three construction locomotives on the Midland System are described as two engines named Pioneer and Little Bess which each weighed 14 tons, and a third engine named Mliss after \\"one of Bret Harte's charming heroines\\", which was imported at about the same time and which weighed only eight tons.p. 145 of \\"Uitenhage Past and Present\\"Uitenhage Past and Present - Souvenir of the Centenary - 1804-1904.

M14 is the most likely candidate, too little is known as yet about the engine itself to positively identify it as the engine Mliss.

It is useful in studying plant development requiring destructive measurement on multiple individuals. By measuring a metric against morphological age, instead of chronological time, one can reduce variations occurring between individuals, thus allowing greater focus on variations due to development.Meicenheimer, R. D. (2014). The plastochron index: Still useful after nearly six decades. American Journal of Botany, 101(11), 1821-1835. What is the leaf plastochron index? The leaf plastochron index, also referred to simply as the plastochron index (PI) as it is derived from, is a demography formula used to determine the developmental age and growing rate of a leaf or other growing plant organ.Erickson, R. and Michelini, F., 1957. THE PLASTOCHRON INDEX. American Journal of Botany, 44(4), pp.297-305. This formula was useful when first introduced as it allowed scientists to be able to track the progression and growth of a plant. According to American Journal of Botany, the typical variation of the formula for the plastochron index is as follows; P.I.=n+{(1nL_n-1nR)\\\\over (1nL_n-1nL_{n+1}) }Meicenheimer, R., 2014. The plastochron index: Still useful after nearly six decades. American Journal of Botany, 101(11), pp.1821-1835. However, another common variation as according to Hans Burstr√∂m‚Äôs book Growth and Growth Substances/Wachstum und Wuchsstoffe, the leaf plastochron index for a certain leaf on a plant is as follows; (L.P.I)_a=(P.I.)-a=n-a+{logL_n-log_10 \\\\over logL_n-logL_{n+1}} This is derived from Burstr√∂m‚Äôs variation of the plastochron index which is as follows; P.I.=n+{logL_n-log_{10} \\\\over logL_n- logL_{n+1}} Other data, not including morphological features, that can be used to determine the leaf‚Äôs developmental age include uptake of oxygen, weight, chlorophyll, etc.Burstr√∂m, H., 1961. Growth And Growth Substances / Wachstum Und Wuchsstoffe. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, p.86. How to use the leaf plastochron index To use the plastochron index, it is important to be able to understand how to use the formula. The following is the key to use the typical variation of the formula; ‚Äún‚Äù is the leaf‚Äôs sequential index (or serial) number. This number is increasing but if the seedling‚Äôs leaves of the organ are the source of study, n = 0. ‚ÄúR‚Äù is the reference length of the leaf. ‚ÄúL_n ‚Äù is the length of the leaf that is longer, or equal, to the reference length. ‚ÄúL_{n+1} ‚Äù is the length of which is shorter than the reference length. However, when using the formula supplied by the American Journal of Botany there are multiple assumptions or requirements of the leaf that is being studied for the calculation to be accurate. Erickson and Michelini dictate that the ‚Äúorgan growth must be exponential‚Äù meaning the leaf must be growing. Also, ‚Äúsuccessive organs must be growing at the same relative rates‚Äù meaning the measurement will not equate to other plant growth unless they share the same growth rate even if they are co-dependently growing. Finally, ‚ÄúSuccessive plastochrons must be equal, where here, plastochrons are defined as the time intervals between the attainment of length R by successive organs‚Äù meaning that some research of the leaf‚Äôs reference length is needed for the formula to be verifiable. In Burstr√∂m‚Äôs variation, he uses a Xanthium plant as an example which was 10 mm (thus, why 10 was used as the reference unit). This was used to show that the plastochron age of this plant is 0. A plant longer than this would have a positive number for its plastochron age and an organ shorter than the reference unit of 10 mm will have a negative plastochron age. Leaf plastochron index in action An example of the leaf plastochron index in action is Philip R. Larson and J. G. Isebrands‚Äô article The Plastochron Index as Applied to Developmental Studies of Cottonwood. A cottonwood leaf was the organ used for this research as this plant has uniform rates of growth, meaning it falls under the requirements needed for the formula‚Äôs verifiability. Two tests were conducted; the first test showed the results of the plastochron intervals ranging between 2-2.76 days but the second test was to calculate the statistical models of the leaf plastochron indexes for all 5 size classes. The five size classes were directly related to the five dependent variables of their study; leaf length, leaf area, vessels per internode, vessels per petiole and leaf weight (dry). This study shows how the leaf plastochron index can be used within scientific research to explore and predict certain developmental events of a leaf or other plant organ‚Äôs life cycle through a non destructive method of morphological feature identification.Larson, P. and Isebrands, J., 1971. The Plastochron Index as Applied to Developmental Studies of Cottonwood. Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 1(1), pp.1-11. Another example of the leaf plastochron index in action is O.E. Ade-Ademilua C.E.J. Botha and R.J. Strasser‚Äôs South African Journal of Botany article A re-evaluation of plastochron index determination in peas -- a case for using leaflet length. For this study the following variation of the leaf plastochron index formula was used; P.I.=n+{logL_n-log\\\\lambda \\\\over logL_n-logL_{n+1}} This study was conducted in order to determine whether the leaf plastochron index works for pea plants (Pisum sativum).The researchers‚Äô results showed that the pea plant (Pisum sativum) met all the requirements needed to use the leaf plastochron index formula in a verifiable manner when finding plastochron age through leaf length. However, these results can only be deduced if early development is measured successfully. This shows that the leaf plastochron index can measure successive pairs of leaflets in pea plants (Pisum sativum).Ade-Ademilua, O., Botha, C. and Strasser, R., 2005. A re-evaluation of plastochron index determination in peas ‚Äî a case for using leaflet length. South African Journal of Botany, 71(1), pp.76-80. Creators of leaf plastochron index This formula was introduced in 1957 by scientists Ralph O. Erickson and Francis J. Michelini, making this scientific formula over 60 years old. Erickson and Michelini‚Äôs formula was first published for The Journal of March in the American Journal of Botany. Although Erickson and Michelini were responsible for introducing the formula, the concept of the plastochron being used as a unit of measurement was inspired by scientist Askenasy originally in 1880. Other names that have contributed to the use of the plastochron are Schmidt in 1924 and Esau in 1953 and again in 1965. Dr. Ralph O. Erickson was born in Duluth, Minnesota in 1914.Sprugel, D., 2015. Ralph O. Erickson ‚Äì The Ecological Society Of America's History And Records. [online] Esa.org. Available at: [Accessed 27 May 2020]. He received an education from Gustavus Adolphus College (St. Peter) in 1939 and Washington University (St. Louis) where he inevitably attained his Ph.D. in 1944. Although he first began teaching at Rochester in 1944 until 1947, much of his career was spent at the University of Pennsylvania where he received his professorship between 1949 until 1985. His primary focus of study was on plant morphology, which he stated in his autobiography that developmental plant morphology was actually one of his most enjoyable courses to teach. Erickson went on to write in his autobiography that when conversing with Michelini that he ‚ÄúFound [himself] writing the formula for the plastochron index on the blackboard, as if by inspiration. The plastochron index has now been used by many authors, including [themselves], in a variety of ways.‚Äù He later went on to receive his Guggenheim Fellowship for his work in plant physiology where he used the plastochron index in order to determine and assess the temperature and light effects on the developmental growth of the plants.Erickson, R., 1988. Growth And Development Of A Botanist. Philadelphia, pp.4-16. Erickson passed away in March of 2006. Dr. Francis J. Michelini was born in Clifton, New Jersey in 1925. He received an education at Seton Hall College, the University of Delaware and the University of Pennsylvania where he received his Doctorate of Philosophy degree in Biological science. This was where he met Ralph O. Erickson.Obits.pennlive.com. 2019. Francis Michelini Obituary - Mechanicsburg, PA  Patriot-News. [online] Available at: [Accessed 27 May 2020]. He began his teaching career at Wilkes College and received his Professorship of Biology in 1963. He was announced as the second President of Wilkes College in 1970 and later served as President of the Commission for Independent Colleges and Universities. In 1957, Michelini published his article The Plastochron Index with Ralph O. Erickson. Michelini passed away in September of 2019.Wilkes.edu. 2020. Dr. Francis J. Michelini - Wilkes University.

It is part of Framingham State University.  History  The museum's original building on Union Avenue The Danforth Museum Corporation was established on August 9, 1973 as a 501 non-profit institution by a local group of community activists, educators, and art lovers. The Art Museum was opened to the public on May 24, 1975 at 123 Union Avenue, Framingham, featuring galleries for temporary exhibitions and a community art school. In February 2013, the Museum purchased the Jonathan Maynard Building on Framingham's Centre Common, anticipating future renovation, as the institution's facilities on Union Avenue were increasingly outdated. The purchase proved timely; in May 2016, the building failed inspection and the Museum was evicted from its location. In 2016, the Museum began negotiations with its neighbor, Framingham State University (FSU), to form a partnership to preserve the Museum for the benefit and enrichment of the community at large‚Äîthe culmination of 40 years of collaboration. In March 2018, the partnership with FSU was finalized. The Framingham State University Foundation assumed the care and ownership of the Museum's permanent collection. The Museum temporarily relocated so that construction to reopen the Museum's galleries could begin immediately. The Museum was closed to the public in August 2016. In early 2017, the Museum offices and school reopened in the Maynard building; its collection was placed into storage for safekeeping, and select exhibitions were moved off-site. The newly renovated Art Museum reopened in April 2019, featuring exhibitions that reflect on the Museum's history and its role within the greater Boston and MetroWest communities. Collections The museum's permanent collection focuses on American Art from the 19th-century to the present, and includes work by Gilbert Stuart, Charles Sprague Pearce, Eastman Johnson, Albert Bierstadt, and Thomas Hart Benton, as well as work by the Boston Expressionists and contemporary artists such as Faith Ringgold, Richard Yarde, Barbara Grad, Andrew Stevovich, and Jason Berger.

Prelude Battle of the Bridge was a decisive Sasanian victory which gave them a huge boost to expel invading Arabs from Mesopotamia. Thus, they advanced with a huge army to fight the remnants of the Muslim army near Kufa on the Euphrates. Caliph Umar sent reinforcements to the region which were mainly the people who were fighting Muslims during the Ridda wars. Battle Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha managed to force the upcoming Persian army to cross the river to a place where his soldiers, who were divided into Brigades, could encircle their numerically superior opponents. The war ended with a huge success for the Muslims, thanks in no small part to the help of local Christian Arab tribes who decided to help the Muslim army. According to Tabari, the Persian leader Mihran bin Badhan was killed by a slave who belonged to the Taghlib tribe and two masters, Jarir and Ibn Hober (later, a dispute ensued between the masters regarding the sharing of Mehran's weapons and clothings which had to be resolved by Al-Muthanna). The Arabs gained the momentum to further expand their wars against the Sassanids and their allies.

The term became popular in the 1800s to describe a victory in which the opposition is \\"buried\\", similar to the way in which a geological landslide buries whatever is in its path. What constitutes a landslide varies by the type of electoral system. Even within an electoral system, there is no consensus on what sized margin makes for a landslide.  Barbados  In Barbadian general elections, a landslide victory involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurres after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood. * 2018 Barbadian general election ‚Äì The Barbados Labour Party led by Opposition Leader Mia Mottley won all 30 seats in the House of Assembly and 74.6% of the popular vote.  Canada  A map of the vote by province in 1940 shows the scale of the Liberals' landslide victory.

Landslide victories may also occur during provincial elections, and territorial elections in Yukon. Landslide victories are not possible for territorial elections in the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, as its members are elected without reference to political parties, operating as a consensus government.

New Zealand  Before 1993, New Zealand used the traditional first-past-the-post system as in the U.K. to determine representation in its Parliament. Thus, landslide elections at that time were defined in an identical fashion, i.e. where one party got an overwhelming majority of the seats. Since 1993, New Zealand has used the mixed member proportional system as in Germany, making landslides much less likely. First past the post * ‚Äì The Liberals won 51 seats and 57.8% of the vote while the Conservatives won 13 seats and just 24.5% of the vote. * ‚Äì The Liberals won 49 seats and 52.7% of the vote while the Conservatives won 19 seats and just 36.6% of the vote. * ‚Äì The Liberals won 58 seats and 53.1% of the vote while the Conservatives won 16 seats and just 29.7% of the vote. * ‚Äì The Reform Party won 55 seats while the Labour & Liberal parties won just 23 seats combined. * ‚Äì The Labour Party won 53 seats while the Coalition won just 19 seats. * ‚Äì The Labour Party won 53 seats while the National Party won just 25 seats. * ‚Äì The Labour Party won 55 seats while the National Party won just 32 seats. * ‚Äì The National Party won 55 seats while the Labour Party won just 32 seats. * ‚Äì The Labour Party won 56 seats while the National Party won just 37 seats. * ‚Äì The National Party won 67 seats while the Labour Party won just 29 seats.

This was the biggest landslide in Philippine history. The legislators won't serve until 1945 though, due to World War II. Starting in 1987, the Philippines evolved into a multi-party system, and coupled with the introduction of party-list elections in 1998, no party was able to win a landslide, much less a majority of seats, in the House of Representatives since then. This has also meant that no presidential and vice presidential election winner won a majority of votes, although, in 1998, the winners were described as having landslide victories, despite winning less than a majority of votes, due to large winning margins. Senatorial landslides are more possible though in midterm elections, as voters are usually presented with two distinct choices.  Presidential and vice presidential elections  In the Philippines, while there are presidential tickets, the positions of president and vice president are elected separately. * 1935 election ‚Äì Manuel L.
