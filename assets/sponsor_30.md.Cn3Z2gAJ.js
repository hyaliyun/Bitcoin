Turner's batting and bowling styles are unknown. He was born in Gringley-on-the-Hill, Nottinghamshire and died at Thatcham House, Thatcham, Berkshire. Cricket Turner made his first-class debut for Gloucestershire against Nottinghamshire in 1886. He played a further first- class match in 1886 against Sussex, before making a final appearance in 1889 against Middlesex.

Personal life Prior to playing cricket, Turner was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Berkshire Regiment. Turner was a proficient sketcher and reporter, as reported by his commanding officer on 29 November 1882. The same year he served in the Egyptian campaign. The following year he undertook training at the School of Musketry in Hythe, Kent, where he became qualified to instruct the theory and practice of Musketry. He was promoted Major in 1901 and retired from the army in 1902. It was in the latter year that he purchased Thatcham House which was to be his home for the remainder of his life. He was re-employed in the First World War as Railway Transport Officer at Aldershot from 1914 to 1917. He served in local government in Berkshire. He was a Deputy Lieutenant, was appointed JP for the county in 1905, and was elected to its County Council in 1907, becoming County Alderman in 1923. Turner was twice married. His first marriage, in 1886, was to Ella, daughter of Charles James Thornton, of St Petersburg, Russia. She died in 1887. He remarried, in 1892, to Jane Elizabeth, only daughter of Admiral Sir Alexander Buller. The couple had five children: Alexander, born on 22 May 1893, Victor, born on 17 January 1900, Cecil, Mark and Jane. Two of their sons who served in the British Army, with both having the distinction of being awarded the Victoria Cross. Alexander was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry while serving with the Royal Berkshire Regiment during the Battle of Loos in September 1915 in World War I. He was wounded during the course of his actions, and succumbed to his wounds days later on 1 October 1915. Victor was awarded his Victoria Cross for gallantry while serving with the Rifle Brigade during the Second Battle of El Alamein in World War II, when he was the Commanding Officer (CO) of his regiment's 2nd Battalion. Under his command the battalion fought off desperate counterattacks by 90 tanks, destroying or immobilising more than 50 of them. During the action, one of the 6-pounder guns was left with only one officer and a sergeant, so Colonel Turner joined them as loader, and between them they destroyed another five tanks. Only on three other occasions have brothers been recipients of the Victoria Cross.

It is an active parish church in the Diocese of Liverpool and the archdeaconry of Warrington. The oldest parts of the church date from the 14th century and there have been several alterations and additions. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History and administration The ecclesiastical parish of Halsall originally included the townships of Halsall, Lydiate, Downholland, Melling and Maghull. The oldest part of the building‚Äîthe chancel‚Äîdates from the early 14th century. The chancel was restored in 1873 at a cost of ¬£2,000 by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. In 1886 the same architects largely rebuilt the nave and aisles, re-roofed and reseated the church, and rebuilt the south porch at a cost of ¬£7,000. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 23 September 1950. The Grade I designation‚Äîthe highest of the three grades‚Äîis for buildings \\"of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important\\". An active church in the Church of England, St Cuthbert's is part of the diocese of Liverpool, which is in the Province of York. It is in the archdeaconry of Warrington and the deanery of Ormskirk. Notably, Arthur Vaughn Williams, father of composer Ralph Vaughn Williams served at St Cuthberts before he was ordained as a vicar in 1868. Architecture =Exterior= St Cuthbert's is constructed of squared sandstone and has stone slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave with a tower to the west, north and south aisles, a south porch, a chancel to the east and a vestry north of the chancel. In the south-west corner, between the tower and south aisle, there is a room that was originally built as a grammar school. The tower is tall and has three stages. The lower stage is square with corner buttresses. There is a flat-headed, two-light west window with tracery. The second stage is octagonal, with flat-headed, two-light belfry louvres. It is topped with a stone spire that has lucarnes (windows). Between the belfry stage and the spire, there is an octagonal parapet with four gargoyles. The roof of the nave has a flat parapet. The former grammar school that projects south of the building, has a crenellated parapet and its roof is gabled. Above the doorway are the Halsall family arms and an inscription that reads \\"E. H. 1593\\". The grammar school has two-light, pointed windows. The windows of the aisles have flat heads and Perpendicular style tracery. The east window in the chancel has five lights with tracery. =Interior and fittings= The nave is separated from the tower by a pointed arch. Between the nave and aisles there are arcades of four bays that have octagonal piers and pointed arches with wave moulding. There is a piscina (basin) in the south wall of the south aisle, and another in the north aisle. The chancel measures by . There are triple-sedilia (priest's seats) and a piscina, all in the Decorated style . The three seats and piscina date from the 14th century and all have arches with cinquefoils. There is a reredos from 1886, painted by Shrigley and Hunt. Stained glass in the church includes work by Harry Harvey and Hardman & Co. External features Sundial and baptismal font in the churchyard. In the churchyard, there are some grave slabs from the Middle Ages that were originally inside the church. There is a sandstone sundial in the churchyard, dating from 1725. Its base has two square steps and there is a baluster stem; the gnomon is probably modern. The sundial has been given a Grade II designation by English Heritage. There is also an octagonal sandstone baptismal font in the churchyard from the 19th century. The font has also received a Grade II listing. Notable interments at St Cuthbert's include Henry Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell (1831‚Äì1906), a British Army officer and Conservative politician, and the English footballer Billy Ayre (1952‚Äì2002). In addition the churchyard contains the war graves of four soldiers of World War I, and two of World War II.

On 30 October 2012, it was reported that BBC One had cancelled In With The Flynns.

Pat and Alan live in Spain. Reception The first episode brought mixed reviews from television critics. The Telegraph‚Ä≤s James Walton commented negatively \\"this is exactly the kind of sitcom that comedies such as The Royle Family and Outnumbered are meant to have seen off long ago - and whose strange persistence traditionally fills critics with a mixture of puzzlement and dismay\\". However he went on to praise the performances of the cast, and called it \\"a perfectly acceptable 30 minutes of undemanding television\\". In much the same way, the Guardian's reviewer Zoe Williams called it \\"bland, smooth and unremarkable\\" and \\"the acting is not great\\" but she also acknowledged that the problem was the set-up: \\"if they want us to fall in love with the Flynns...they need to be a bit more like actual people\\". One more positive review came from Metro, who said \\"Don't set your expectations too high. It's not completely terrible, and has a decent cast...Maybe it‚Äôll settle into a more chucklesome formula once this set-up episode‚Äôs out of the way. Series two of the show was also criticized by some commentators. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote, \\"The BBC's In With the Flynns feels like a tired, lame sitcom because it is a tired, lame sitcom.\\", while Phil Harrison of Time Out wrote, \\"Sky has thrown down the gauntlet to the BBC lately. Daring dramas, comedies that actually raise a chuckle and even the annexation of one of the Beeb's comedy crown jewels in Alan Partridge. How will Auntie respond? With a second series of piss-weak sitcom In With The Flynns, that's how.... the dialogue is flat, the jokes telegraphed and the characterisation superficial\\". However, Emma Sturgess, also writing for The Guardian, was more positive; \\"...although In with the Flynns is pretty broad, it's not total carp\\".

Life Fisher was born in Rochester, Kent in or about 1781, the younger of the two sons of Thomas Fisher, printer, bookseller, and alderman of Rochester. In 1786 Fisher entered the India House as an extra clerk; in April 1816 he was appointed searcher of records. He retired on a pension in June 1834, after having spent in different offices under the company altogether forty-six years. He died unmarried on 20 July 1836, in his sixty-fifth year, at his lodgings in Church Street, Stoke Newington, and was buried on the 26th in Bunhill Fields. From the time of his coming to London he had resided at Gloucester Terrace, Hoxton, in the parish of Shoreditch. Before he left Rochester Fisher's work as a draughtsman attracted the attention of Isaac Taylor the engraver. He was also eminent as an antiquary. Fisher was in 1821 elected F.S.A. of Perth, and on 5 May 1836 F.S.A. of London, an honour from which he had been hitherto debarred, as a dissenter. His collections of topographical drawings and prints, portraits and miscellaneous prints, books, and manuscripts, were sold by Evans on 30 May 1837 and two following days. Works Some plates in the Custumale Roffense, published by John Thorpe in 1788, are from drawings by Fisher; while the same work states that he had helped Samuel Denne, one of the promoters of the undertaking, in examining the architecture and monuments of Rochester Cathedral. His first literary effort, a description of the Crown Inn at Rochester and its cellars, was printed with a view and plan in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1789, under the pseudonym of 'Antiquitatis Conservator'. Cites: Gentleman's Magazine vol. lix. pt. ii. p. 1185 He had previously contributed drawings for one or two plates. In 1795 Denne communicated to the Society of Antiquaries a letter on the subject of watermarks in paper, enclosing drawings by Fisher of sixty-four specimens, together with copies of several autographs and documents discovered by him in a room over the town hall at Rochester. Notes: The letter, accompanied by the drawings, is printed in Arch√¶ologia, xii. 114-31. By Fisher's care the records were afterwards placed in proper custody. His next publications were \\"An Engraving of a fragment of Jasper found near Hillah, bearing part of an inscription in the cuneiform character\\" (1802), Notes: s. sh. 4to, London, 1802 and \\"An Inscription [in cuneiform characters] of the size of the original, copied from a stone lately found among the ruins of ancient Babylon\\" (1803), Cites: s. sh. fol., London, 1803 In 1806 and 1807 Fisher helped preserve two specimens of Roman mosaic discovered in the city of London, one in front of East India House in Leadenhall Street, and the other, which was presented to the British Museum, in digging foundations for the enlargement of the Bank of England. These he had engraved from drawings made by himself, and he published a description of them in the Gentleman's Magazine.c Gentleman's Magazine vol. lxxvii. pt. i. p. 415. In the summer of 1804 Fisher discovered some legendary paintings on the roof and walls of the chapel belonging to the ancient Guild of Holy Cross in Stratford-on-Avon. Notes: A work based upon this and muniments lent to Fisher by the corporation appeared in 1807 as \\"A Series of antient Allegorical, Historical, and Legendary Paintings . . . discovered . . . on the walls of the Chapel of the Trinity at Stratford-upon-Avon . . . also Views and Sections illustrative of the Architecture of the Chapel\\", parts i-iv.

Between 1812 and 1816 Fisher published ninety-five plates from his drawings of monumental and other remains in Bedfordshire. Cites: Collections Historical, Genealogical, and Topographical for Bedfordshire, London, 1812-16. A second part, consisting of 114 folio plates, appeared only a few weeks before his death in 1836. In 1838 John Gough Nichols added descriptions to a new edition. Meanwhile, Fisher had printed at the lithographic press of D. J. Redman thirty-seven drawings of 'Monumental Remains and Antiquities in the county of Bedford,' of which fifty copies were issued in 1828. Fisher was one of the first to welcome lithography in the UK. As early as 1808 he published an account of it, under the title of 'Polyantography,' with a portrait of Philip H. Andr√©, its first introducer into England, in the 'Gentleman's Magazine,' vol. lxxviii. pt. i. p. 193\\\\. In 1807 he published in four lithographic plates. lists them as: # \\"A Collection of all the Characters . . . which appear in the Inscription on a Stone found among the Ruins of ancient Babylon . . . now deposited in the East Indian Company's Library at Leadenhall Street.\\" # \\"A Pedestal, and Fragment of a Statue of Hercules . . . dug out of the Foundations of the Wall of the City of London.\\" # \\"Ichnography, with Architectural Illustrations of the old Church of St. Peter le Poor in Broad Street, London.\\" # \\"Sir W. Pickering, from his Tomb in St. Helen's Church, London\\". Shortly afterwards he issued several plates of monumental brasses to illustrate Edward Hasted's 'Kent' and Daniel Lysons's 'Environs of London.' In order to encourage the artist Hilkiah Burgess, Fisher had ten plates etched of 'Sepulchral Monuments in Oxford.' These were issued in 1836. Many of the biographies of distinguished Anglo-Indians in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' were contributed by Fisher. That of Charles Grant, father of Lord Glenelg, was afterwards enlarged and printed for private circulation, London, 1833. He also likewise a contributor to the European Magazine, the Asiatic Journal, and to religious periodicals. He was one of the projectors of the Congregational Magazine, and from 1818 to 1823 ran its statistical department of that serial. When elected a guardian of Shoreditch, where he lived, he assisted John Ware, the vestry clerk, in the compilation of 'An Account of the several Charities and Estates held in trust for the use of the Poor of the Parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Middlesex, and of Benefactors to the same,' 1836.

Architecture Panoramic view of Expo 98 and the Vasco da Gama Bridge The work of √Ålvaro Siza Vieira looms large in the 1970s, '80s and the '90s. Other architects considered influential are Manuel Ta√≠nha, Jorge Ferreira Chaves, Fernando T√°vora, Eduardo Souto Moura and Nuno Teot√≥nio Pereira. The emergence of the new architect generations that came to succeed the referred architects introduced a progressive expansion of the arquitectonic tendencies. Tom√°s Taveira gains fame and renown through his personal exhibition, which took place at the Amoreiras Shopping Center (Centro Comercial das Amoreiras), in Lisbon. √Ålvaro Siza Vieira, already known for the rebuild of Chiado (traditional Lisbon neighbourhood on the left side of Rua Augusta), after being destroyed by a fire, designed the Portugal Pavilion for Expo 98 with his friend, Eduardo Souto Moura. This contemporary architecture sample graced with worldwide exposure in 1998 stood out as a landmark for 20th century Portuguese history, promoting Portuguese works recognized national and internationally, such as the Vasco da Gama tower, Pavilh√£o Atl√¢ntico, Lisbon oceanarium or the Portugal Pavilion. The theme was ‚Äúthe oceans‚Äù, very adequate for the event as Portugal is historically known for sailing throughout unknown oceans, and reaching some remote places such as Sri Lank, India, Macau or Brazil. Accompanied by its sea tradition, Portugal has come back to its roots, turning what is now Parque das Na√ß√µes into the biggest site for contemporary architecture sample in Lisbon. Another important landmark was also built in 1998: the second longest bridge in Europe - the Vasco da Gama Bridge. Casa da M√∫sica (House of Music), built in Oporto and designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, has brought new life to contemporary Portuguese architecture. It was built as part of the project of Porto - European Capital of Culture. Painting, sculpture and ceramics In the mid '70s, right after the Carnation Revolution, Portuguese painting and sculpture started giving their first steps towards contemporaneity firstly by exploring Pop Art (although late when compared to the rest of Europe), not leaving behind Op Art. Maria Helena Vieira da Silva, an artist that lived during modernism and then during contemporary art, chose painting as her main focus. However, she also works in azuleijaria (painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework). The Lisbon Metropolitan has some of her works decorating its walls. Other artists that work in contemporary azulejaria are J√∫lio Pomar and J√∫lio Resende, artists who are becoming references in contemporary European painting. Minimalism enters the contemporary Portuguese art scene definitely in the '80s. It first reveals itself shyly in erudite music and then spreads out in other art forms such as painting and sculpture. Although in painting the minimalist movement remains discreet, with an oversimplified design deriving from abstractionism and a limited number of colours, in sculpture it extends itself as a hallmark of the minimalistic movement. In minimalistic sculpture, detail isn't left behind, but rather ostensible shown off allied with colours and artificial light games installed on the sculpture exhibition space. Engraving follows the same process. It is during this period that Vitor Pomar, who had already made his debut in the '70s, achieves a higher place on the artistic Portuguese scene. Pedro Cabrita Reis' Cabinet d‚ÄôAmateur -2 (Stockholm version) Joana Vasconcelos' N√©ctar , at the entrance of the Berardo Museum. Photography becomes a well-respected art, forgotten since the surrealism period and brought back to Portugal on the '80s. Minimalist photography encompasses common elements of sculpture and painting of the same style. Later on the Portuguese artistic scene, names like Paula Rego and Jorge Martins begin to make an impact. Although with apparently different styles, they both manage to disturb and interact directly with the viewer through their paintings. Paula Rego, even though not being the most international Portuguese artist, she is the most internationally known painter. Many of her works belong to private collections like the Berardo Collection, an immensely important and valuable modern Portuguese contemporary art collection (evaluated by Christies in 316 million dollars), which also has valuable paintings by Jorge Martins. The artist explores the deep, the space through the colour contrast. Another important scene on the contemporary Portuguese art is the Azulejaria (already mentioned previously), where Manuel Cargaleiro and Querubin Lapa stand as its flagship, innovating it by creating a new style based on contrasts ‚Äì since the azulejo allows it - and popularizing geometrical figures in art. Another artist to make a statement is Barahona Possollo, one of the most famous contemporary Portuguese artists. His work is characterized by a richness of warm colours, nuances of velvet shadows, and an almost photographical detail of great technical quality. Alberto Lume is also a prominent Portuguese artist. In 2006, CCB presented a retrospective exhibit of his work. Some time before, also Serralves did organize a Paula Rego's exhibit, in which around 200.000 people joined. Portugal, nowadays, performs a more and more important role in contemporary painting and sculpture. Joana Vasconcelos is one of the most famous Portuguese contemporary artists of the final 80's generation. In 2007, Portugal strengthened its presence on the art scene with the opening of the Berardo Collection Museum on the Cultural Center of Bel√©m, in Lisbon. Funda√ß√£o Serralves, in Oporto, is another international renowned art institution. In 2012, the modern art collection ‚ÄúPortugal Telecom Foundation‚Äù continues to be one of the only collections that has been touring around the country during the last years, promoting some of the most important modern Portuguese artists from the 1960s and onwards, like Joaquim Rodrigo, Lourdes Castro, Paula Rego, Alberto Carneiro, Eduardo Batarda, Jo√£o Vieira, Jorge Vieira, Jorge Molder, J√∫lia Ventura, Helena Almeida, Fernando Brito, Manuel Jo√£o Vieira, Marta Wengorovius, Rita Barros, Eva Mota, √Ålvaro Lapa, Sara Anathory, Miguel Soares, Joana Rosa, Ant√≥nio Palopo, Gerardo Burmester, Joaquim Bravo, Maria Jos√© Oliveira or Joao Vilhena. Installation art Although still not quite known among the Portuguese public or widely acknowledged on a European level, ‚Äúinstallation art‚Äù is, however, beginning to take its first steps. Quite a few artists are working hard to achieve the recognition of this art, which sprung in Portugal, during the 1990s, at the core of a well-rooted rock culture. Joana Vasconcelos is one of the most famous artists using pop culture elements on a large scale as well as everyday objects when building her sculptures. In 2005, she presented \\"A Noiva\\" (‚ÄúThe Bride‚Äù) during Veneza's Bienniel, with √Çngela Ferreira as the official representative (project commissioned by Jurgen Bock). N√©ctar is a batch composed of two sculptures comprised in Colec√ß√£o Berardo, headquartered in CCB, along with its Aladino installation. Contemporary fashion Back then, runways were no more than a confection's display, and any dressmaker who dared to venture and be innovative was set aside. However, there have been some designers who did not let this happen and fought through all criticism aimed at them, such as Ana Salazar. She carried out the work in Portugal which Chanel had done decades ago in France: breaking with the canons and granting women more freedom. Furthermore, her originality combined with the irreverence of her various styles have made her the most eccentric female Portuguese designer in European History. She has gained fame and remarkable success in the Portuguese spectrum, an artist which many had called ‚Äúunaesthetic‚Äù. Ana Salazar became the great exponent of Portuguese contemporary fashion, being the first Portuguese fashion designer to ever go international. Nonetheless, her days of glory are gone and her creations are no longer unique nor the newest. Many other designers emerged on the scene in the late eighties and nineties, such as Miguel Vieira. This designer, whose collections are made out of black and white (and out of grey as well, at a later stage), stands out due to his creations‚Äô perfect, classic and rather flexible shapes, specially made for the modern executive woman. His glamorous style is called city chick. Jo√£o R√¥lo becomes an ‚Äúelite designer‚Äù, claiming to be the only Haute-Couture Portuguese designer, which is far from the truth... The revival of Jos√© Ant√≥nio Tenente, the man who dressed Maria Jos√© Ritta, the former first lady, in international events, and who does also explore city chick is known for his flushing evening gowns and their perfect cut, many of whose were worn by B√°rbara Guimar√£es during the Golden Globes awards. Not to mention Manuel Alves and Jos√© Manuel Gon√ßalves whose creations never fail to amaze us and are the ones favored by the high Portuguese society. F√°tima Lopes appears in the nineties and becomes Ana Salazar's rival, and is the most international Portuguese designer to date, sponsored by Joe Berardo. One of her creations, and one of the best-known Portuguese pieces of art in the world, is a rather small bikini made out of gold and diamonds, priced 500.000 euros, having been worn by its very own designer on a runway in Paris. Nowadays, Portugal can be said to be a medium-sized star in the narrow and competitive Fashion World thanks to new designers such as Maria Gambina, Katty Xiomara, and Dino Alves, known as \\"l'enfant terrible de la mode\\", among others. Although there have been a few endeavors such as Portugal Fashion, in Porto, and Moda Lisboa, in the capital, the general public still fails to see the excellence in fashion as an art form, when they really should. They see the creations as a product, not as a piece of art, or a painting or an installation. Therefore, the investment is still little and the little there is, is simply not enough, leading some designers to abandon their career in favor of something more profitable and less expensive, as did Miguel Flor, a promising designer who ran out of funds to keep his fashion company alive. Despite that, the investment is rising and the interest follows, as well as the praise that Portuguese fashion designers are conquering. Music Contemporary music in Europe is estimated to have begun in the mid-'50s. If we take into account the pop sensations that Madalena Iglesias and Simone de Oliveira were, contemporary Portuguese music should have started around the same time. And it should have happened in a rather jovial way as the young pop environment was breaking ground in society through the youngsters. Electronic music, which was rising in Germany, was then exported to Portugal, revealing itself as a success in the '80s. The pop fever got stronger in the '70s, also known as the ‚Äúroaring years‚Äù along with the '20s, with the growth of equally fulminating nightclubs largely situated on the coastline. It should be mentioned that the settling of this music genre had a very uneven growth between the coastline and the midland, the north and mid-north, and the south and mid-south. Whilst coastal and cosmopolitan Lisbon was following trends, even if discretely when compared to other European capitals, the midland was still completely clueless, remaining behind its time even today. The Hippie era strikes the country with its relaxed and urban style, and Portugal adapts itself deeply to this new trend. The Disco fever emerges and with it, the nightclubs. While in a corruptible dictatorship regime, responsible for years of cultural delay in comparison to the rest of Europe, the voice of artists like that of Ant√≥nio Varia√ß√µes and Carlos Pai√£o's, among others, started to become popular. Both had an enormous success. Songs like Playback and P√≥ de Arroz (Rice powder) from Pai√£o, and O Corpo √© que paga (The Body pays it) from Varia√ß√µes, are unforgettable. The death of Ant√≥nio Varia√ß√µes, in 1984 was a great loss for contemporary music. However, ten years earlier, in 1974, when Portugal was still testing the waters of this new cool disco look, peaceful revolution took place on 25 April, which defined the Portuguese way of being. The most interesting part is that the Carnation Revolution (Revolu√ß√£o dos Cravos), as it would later be called, started with a song: Gr√¢ndola, Vila Morena, an intervention song which derived from intervention poetry. The intervention song got popular and its grieving content was a success, notwithstanding its hopeful and dreamy side, in the history of European contemporary music. Fado is put on the backburner, as it was considered to bring back memories from Salazar's dictatorship, and brought back up only in mid-‚Äò90s. In the ‚Äò80s, electronic music became popular and was broadcast on radio and played in nightclubs in Lisbon. The rural midland finally starts to take its first steps on catching on to its contemporaries. Electronic music begins to conquer listeners from remote areas. Portugal also joins a rather eccentric and unusual age. It‚Äôs the beginning of the age of rock music. Punk and dark rock derived from it shortly after, among others, and later on, metal and heavy metal did too. These are still conquering new listeners nowadays. By the ‚Äò90s Xutos e Pontap√©s had started performing, and Rui Veloso became the best Portuguese Rock artist to date. Paulo Gonzo, Jorge Palma, Silence 4, GNR and others were also popular. Rui Veloso. As for erudite music, somewhat hidden until mid-‚Äò80s, several talented composers, pianists and orchestra conductors stood out as they did everything to make this genre last through the European erudite musical scene. M√°rio Laginha and Maria Jo√£o Pires were amongst the most talented. Carlos T√™ becomes Rui Veloso‚Äôs favorite composer. In the beginning of the Portuguese pop scene, Dulce Pontes, an artist with un unmatchable voice, makes her debut and renews Fado by giving it a new voice, bringing a new life to it. She also plays around with folklore and pop (Lusitana Paix√£o -Lusitanian Passion- being her major pop hit), but it was thanks to Fado that she became a breakthrough in music (Can√ß√£o do Mar being her major Fado hit). Sara Tavares and her ballads, together with Anabela Pires‚Äô brilliant voice, result as two of the best voices of Portugal. Morna music's diva, Ces√°ria √âvora, also gave her contribution with her remarkable voice. Fado is finally brought back by Dulce Pontes. And a new wave of Fado singers re-emerge in a revival fashion, surging into the ‚Äúplaza‚Äù, making Fado the most popular kind of music in Portugal. This wave started with Mariza, which became the diva of Fado, since the death of Am√°lia Rodrigues, beating Dulce Pontes by far. Gon√ßalo Salgueiro, Ana Moura, K√°tia Guerreiro, among others, followed their steps. The Gift. In 2004, Rock in Rio Lisbon happens for the first time, catapulting Portugal to top place in worldwide music. Around this time, the hip hop generation was taking over the worldwide market, and Portugal was no exception, becoming one of the four countries with the widest hip hop production, right after USA, France and Italy. Da Weasel becomes then the most popular Portuguese hip-hop band. In 2005, the MTV Europe Music Awards Lisbon were broadcast in Lisbon. This European event brings to Lisbon some of the most important faces of worldwide contemporary music, such as Madonna, Robbie Williams, Craid David and others. The Gift won the ‚ÄúBest Portuguese Band‚Äù category. As a band it made a huge difference by introducing something remarkably new which was making a transvestite from Lisbon the main character of their first music video. In 2006, Sam the Kid makes his commercial music a bit more Portuguese, and leaves his rebel-ish mark with a kind of music that became known as a symbol of scandal for defending the Portuguese language in an irreverent way. Fado strikes again and becomes more international. Mariza finally detaches herself from Am√°lia Rodrigues and records her new album, Transparente, in Brazil, and importing new and tropical MPB (Brazilian popular music) sounds strengthening the cultural connections between Portugal and Brazil. The disc was hailed by the critics. Still during this year, the actress Maria de Medeiros, one of the best in Portugal, records her first album, exploring Jazz, with a Brazilian touch ‚Äì its accent. MPB influences the Portuguese music more each day passed which is seen as a positive thing by the critics and the general public. Jacinta stands out as one of the best female voices in worldwide Jazz. Maria Jo√£o also chose Jazz to explore her tender and warm voice. Literature and poetry Miguel Torga. Literature, and especially poetry, were among the few art forms that developed during the Portuguese dictatorship, thanks to a movement we call today ‚ÄúIntervention Poetry‚Äù. With the inexistence of freedom of speech, writers and poets had to develop new and original forms of poetry and literature writing. What would happen at the time was that whenever an author touched a forbidden theme according to the regime, they were ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù by the famous ‚Äúlapis- azul‚Äù (Blue-Pencil in Portuguese, symbolic pen color that was used to cross out undesirable content), hence forcing writers to adopt a subtly revolutionary style, that would become one of the most remarkable artistic movements of the 20th century Intervention Poetry. Intervention Poetry scraps out the sonnets and easily done rhymes, as well as the metric syllables in literature poetry, developing a completely innovative movement that disrespects and breaks with every poetical convention. However, Intervention Poetry is not yet officially regarded as a literary artistic movement. Zeca Afonso, with his mysterious look and creative genius; Manuel Alegre, rocked back and forth in an eternal ‚Äúgreen pine ship‚Äù that stood against the dictatorship; and Ary dos Santos, the great vice and bohemia's icon from Lisbon's traditional neighborhoods and a merciless theorist, were some of the most important names of this movement. Alexandre O‚ÄôNeill was also a reference on the contemporary Portuguese poetry. His ‚ÄúAdeus Portugal‚Äù (Goodbye Portugal) and ‚ÄúH√° palavras que nos Beijam‚Äù (There are words that kiss us) are influential Portuguese poems. In more recent times, one can watch Mariza giving voice to this last poem on her musical shows worldwide. She sang it at the Carnegie Hall, in New York, on the Royal Albert Hall in London and on the Sydney Opera among other places around the world. His poetry shows the grief brought to him by his lovers, as well as by the whole world. Pedro Homem de Melo comes off as yet another great artist from that time, even if he is slightly forgotten nowadays. It was he who wrote ‚Äúpovo que lavas no rio‚Äù (You People, who wash by the river), performed by Am√°lia Rodriges. His innovative yet ideologically conservative writing supported the regime. Coming from aristocratic families who were supporters of the Salazar's dictatorship, Homem de Melo showed his sympathy to the authoritarian government through his poetry, perhaps being the reason why he is so forgotten in our days, despite his rich and recognized career. Eug√©nio de Andrade and Ant√≥nio Gede√£o are two of the greatest contemporary poetry geniuses. Eug√©nio de Andrade struggled to get in the highly restrictive literary vanguard circles: his seemingly nonsensical poetry was hardly accepted, and his genius remained unseen on the eyes of the intellectual society. Only in the ‚Äò70s, with the implantation of the democratic liberal regime, was his talent finally recognized being awarded the Cam√µes Prize. Sophia de Mello Breyner, another author being distinguished, in 1999, with the Cam√µes Prize, becomes the most famous Portuguese poet of the 20th century. She also wrote several tales for children taught nowadays in Portuguese primary schools, A Fada Oriana being an example. Her creative intellect is disturbing and impetuous, her plots memorable and transmit her outstanding imagination. Sophia de Mello Breyner Ant√≥nio Gede√£o is one of the most creative intervention poets, author of the renowned Pedra Filosofal. David Mour√£o-Ferreira, Fiama Hasse Pais Brand√£o, Ruy Belo and others are also included in the restricted elitist group of Portuguese contemporary writers. Jo√£o Apolin√°rio, also linked to the intervention poetry, emerges in the Portuguese and Brazilian literary background, with important and valuable contributions to the cultures of both countries. His work is the stage of a notable exchange between the Brazilian culture and the Portuguese one, adapting them both mutually. He was also an honourable journalist in S√£o Paulo. In the literary background, Maria Aliete Galhoz, Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s, Jos√© R√©gio, Maria Velho da Costa, Miguel Torga (also in poetry) and Ant√≥nio Lobo Antunes emerged. Miguel Torga, exploring poetry and prose, created his own revolution, a ‚Äúrural revolution‚Äù, since he lively portraits the rural background that was one of his and Portugal's realities. Aiming to become deputy of the Republic Assembly, Nat√°lia Correia defended the cultural and historic Azorean heritage insistently, becoming one of the main figures of Portuguese contemporary literature and poetry. It is impossible to not mention Jos√© Saramago, the ‚Äúgiant‚Äù of Portuguese literature, and the only Portuguese author winning the Nobel Prize for Literature thanks to the incorruptible and memorable Memorial do Convento. L√≠dia Jorge, with several novels that became very successful, like a Costa dos Murm√∫rios, adapted into a film, is considered one of the elitists of present literature. Her books reveal several ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù of the Algarve region where she was born and humbly raised. Her work is also stage of an enormous feminine sensitivity. Ana Maria Magalh√£es, Isabel Al√ßada and Alice Vieira helped renewing literature, adapting it, as well as History, for young people. The first two, wrote together the Uma Aventura collection, counting now with more than a million of sold books. Joel Lira also makes his way through poetry, a writer from Seixal, known by his fertile and ambitious imagination. Sombras do Meu Sentir is his most popular book, which takes the reader to an abyss between the sadness and the happiness of the main character. Theatre and cinema Dramaturgy is not left behind; however it is more forgotten with each year. Society's evils and flaws became drama's main focus. This art form was only born in Portugal around the time Salazar was head of state, namely ‚ÄúTeatro de Revista‚Äù, or ‚ÄúRevista √† portuguesa‚Äù, whose social criticism was seen as light and cheerful. Nowadays, the theatre has its days counted, having already handed its pedestal over to the cinema, which has become today's \\"worship art\\"; the most famous Portuguese director is Filipe La F√©ria, although much of his art is deemed as commercial. As for the cinema, which in time gathers more and more awards, it is pushing Portugal further and beyond its borders, collecting renowned directors such as Manuel de Oliveira and Jo√£o Botelho, among others. Among the best of Portuguese contemporary actors are Ruy de Carvalho, Raul Solnado, Eunice Mu√±oz, and from a later generation, Alexandra Lencastre, Jos√© Raposo, Beatriz Batarda, Jo√£o Villaret, Herman Jos√©, Joaquim de Almeida and Maria de Medeiros, some of which had their careers pass through Hollywood.

Early life He was of obscure origin and was usually known by the name of Fisher, because his father was a fishmonger in Warwick. His ability recommended him to John Dudley, Viscount Lisle,The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558, ed. S.T. Bindoff, 1982 who took him into his service, and on 4 May 1542 constituted him high steward and bailiff of his manor of Kibworth Beauchamp, Leicestershire. For his exercise of that office during life Fisher had an annuity granted to him, which was confirmed in the reign of Mary I. He became one of the two Members of Parliament for Warwick. Dissolution of the monasteries He contrived to accumulate a vast estate in monastery and church lands. In 1546 he obtained the site of St Sepulchre's Priory, Warwick, with the lands adjacent, and proceeded to pull the monastery to the ground, raising in the place of it a house Hawkyns-nest, or Hawks-nest, also the 'Priory'; now the estate is Priory Park. In 1547, Bishop's Itchington, Warwickshire, being alienated to him from the see of Coventry and Lichfield,For the acquisition, see Warwickshire County Record Office (Landor of Rugely (Staffs) and Bishops Tachbrook collection), National Archives Online Catalogue 1908/72/1-4, dates 1546-47, 1548, 1549, 1558. he made an 'absolute depopulation' of that part called Nether Itchington, and demolished the church for the purpose of building a large manor-house on its site. He also changed the name of the village to Fisher's Itchington. Secretary to Somerset and Scottish war Fisher, who was now the chief citizen of Warwick, was secretary to the Duke of Somerset, protector of England. There is a tradition that he was colonel of a regiment in the English army at the battle of Pinkie, on 10 September 1547. Towards the end of June 1548 he was commissioned by Somerset to travel north to Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury and William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton, with instructions for the defence of Haddington, and for the other manoeuvres of the army in Scotland. He was also to go to Sir John Luttrell at Broughty, and with him and Patrick Gray, 4th Lord Gray of Scotland to devise a means of communicating with Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll for negotiations. He was told to take the assured Scots Alexander Crichton of Brunstane and John Cockburn of Ormiston into his confidence, and reward the Scottish Lord Gray with a gold chain and money. Fisher reported what he had accomplished to Somerset and William Cecil from Berwick upon Tweed on 30 July.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (1898), pp. 129‚Äì131 Fisher's instructions, 27 June 1548, pp. 152‚Äì4. In March 1549 he was appointed along with John Luttrell to confer with the Earls of Argyll, Atholl, Errol and other Scottish nobles for the return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France and 'accomplishment of the godly purpose of marriage'. On 17 September 1549 he complained in letter to William Cecil, dated from Innerwick, about the abandonment of Haddington and his own eyes and legs swollen with the rheum.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (1898), 173, 178-80 In 1552 he had a grant of the bailiwick of Banbury, Oxfordshire. He was also made collector of the king's revenue within the borough and hundred, and governor of Banbury Castle. Under Mary I It was rumoured that the Duke of Northumberland, anticipating want of money to pay the forces which would be required in the event of his daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey being proclaimed queen, gave a large sum to Fisher's keeping, which was hidden by him in Bishop's Itchington pool. After the attainder and execution of the Duke in 1553, Fisher was questioned about the money by orders from the queen, but he refused to deliver it up; his fingers were pulled out of joint by the rack. Fisher represented Warwick in the second parliament of Mary, 1554, and in the first (1554), second (1555), and third (1557-8) of Philip and Mary. Under Elizabeth I In 1571, when Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, celebrated the Order of St Michael in the collegiate church of Warwick, the bailiff and burgesses of the borough were invited to attend the Earl from the Priory, where he was Fisher's guest for six or seven days; and from there they went in grand procession to the church. Just after the ceremony, at which he had been present, William Parr, marquis of Northampton died suddenly at the Priory. The following year Elizabeth I paid a sudden visit to the Priory, when returning to Warwick from Kenilworth, on Saturday night, 17 August. She had dined with Fisher's son, Edward, at his house at Itchington on the Monday previously. After supping with Mrs. Fisher and her company, her majesty withdrew for to visiting Fisher, afflicted with gout. He vowed to be on horseback when she travelled on. He attended the queen on her return to Kenilworth and rode in company with Lord Burghley. Death Fisher died 12 January 1577, and was buried at the upper end of the north aisle in St Mary's Church, Warwick. His tomb, which bore the recumbent effigies of himself and his first wife Winifred, daughter of William Holt, probably perished in the fire of 1694; it was engraved by Wenceslas Hollar. Fisher is sometimes mistaken for the John Fisher who compiled the 'Black Book of Warwick.' The latter was in all probability John Fisher, bailiff of Warwick, in 1565. Family He married Katherine, daughter of Sir Richard Longe, by whom he had issue, Thomas, John, Dorothy, and Katherine. His son and heir, Edward Fisher, was thirty years old at the time of his father's death. His inheritance, William Dugdale states, was then worth ¬£3,000 a year, but he soon squandered it, and hastened his ruin by making a fraudulent conveyance to deceive Serjeant John Puckering, to whom in 1581 he sold the Priory and lands adjoining. The serjeant commenced a prosecution against him in the Star Chamber; in which the Earl of Leicester interposed. Fisher ultimately consented that an act of parliament should be made to confirm the estate to Puckering, but being encumbered with debts he was committed to the Fleet Prison, where he spent the rest of his life.

For a state of the art discussion of its merits and drawbacks, see . The central thesis of skeptical theism is that it would not be surprising for an infinitely intelligent and knowledgeable being's reasons for permitting evils to be beyond human comprehension. That is, what may seem like pointless evils may be necessary for a greater good or to prevent equal or even greater evils. This central thesis may be argued from a theistic perspective, but is also argued to defend positions of agnosticism. Skeptical theism can be an informally held belief based on theistic doctrine, but the origin of the term skeptical theist is the 1996 paper \\"The Skeptical Theist\\" by philosopher Paul Draper. Following Draper's publication, the term skeptical theism was adopted in academic philosophy and has developed into a family of positions supporting skeptical theism's central skeptical thesis; we should remain skeptical of claims that human beings can discern God's reasons for evils. One argument is based on analogy, likening our understanding of God's motives to those of a child grasping a parent's reasons for seeking painful medical treatment, for example. Other approaches are the limitations on the human ability to understand the moral realm, and appeals to epistemic factors such as sensitivity or contextual requirements. In the philosophy of religion, skeptical theism is not a broad skepticism toward human knowledge of God, but is instead putatively presented as a response to philosophical propositions, such as those focused on drawing \\"all things considered\\" inductive conclusions about God's motives from perceived circumstances. Additionally, skeptical theism is not a position used to defend all forms of theism, though it is most often presented in the defense of orthodox Christian theism. Moreover, skeptical theism is not supported by all theists and some who support its skeptical positions are not theists. In philosophy, skeptical theism is a defense of theistic or agnostic positions argued to undercut a crucial premise in atheological arguments from evil, a claim that God could have no good reasons for allowing certain types of evil. It is also presented in response to other atheological arguments claiming to know God's purposes based on circumstances, such as the argument from divine hiddenness. Draper's skeptical theism In the philosophy of religion, skeptical theism is the position that we should be skeptical of our ability to assess God's motivations or lack of motivation from our perceptions of the circumstances we observe in the world. The view is a response to the atheological argument from evil, which asserts that some evils in the world are gratuitous, pointless, or inscrutable evils, and that they thus represent evidence against the existence of the God of orthodox Christianity. God, by the orthodox view, is thought to be omniscient (all-knowing), omnibenevolent (all-good) and omnipotent (all- powerful). Insofar as it tries to reconcile this conception of God with concerns about gratuitous evils (evils that do occur in the world, but which God is argued to have no morally sufficient reason for permitting), skeptical theism can be considered a form of theodicy. As originally proposed by agnostic philosopher Paul Draper, the view is intended to undercut a key premise in the argument from evil by suggesting that human cognitive faculties could be insufficient to permit drawing inductive inferences concerning God's reasons or lack of reasons for permitting perceived evils. The evidential argument from evil The evidential argument from evil asserts that the amount, types, or distribution of evils, provide an evidential basis for concluding that God's existence is improbable. The argument has a number of formulation, but can be stated in the Modus ponens logical form: # If an omniscient, omnibenevolent and omnipotent God exists, there should be no gratuitous evil. # There exists instances of gratuitous evil. # Therefore, an omniscient, omnibenevolent and omnipotent God does not exist. In this logical form the conclusion (3) is true, if both the major premise (1) and minor premise (2) are true. Philosophers have challenged both premises, but skeptical theism focuses on the minor premise (2). In 1979, philosopher William Rowe provided a defense of the minor premise (2). He argued that no state of affairs we know of is such that an omnipotent, omniscient being‚Äôs obtaining it would morally justify that being‚Äôs permitting some instances of horrific suffering. Therefore, Rowe concludes, it is likely that no state of affairs exists that would morally justify that being in permitting such suffering. In other words, Rowe argues that his inability to think of a good reason why God would allow a particular evil justifies the conclusion that there is no such reason, and the conclusion that God does not exist. =The \\"noseeum\\" inference= The philosophers Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea described William Rowe's justification for the second premise of the argument from evil: > Some evidential arguments from evil ... rely on a ‚Äúnoseeum‚Äù inference of the > following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can‚Äôt think of any God- > justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then it is likely that > there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a ‚Äònoseeum‚Äô inference is > that it says, more or less, that because we don‚Äôt see ‚Äòum, they probably > ain‚Äôt there.) Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically dubious. For example, a novice chess player's inability to discern a chess master's choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move. =The skeptical theist's response= Skeptical theism provides a defense against the evidential argument from evil, but does not take a position on God‚Äôs actual reason for allowing a particular instance of evil. The defense seeks to show that there are good reasons to believe that God could have justified reasons for allowing a particular evil that we cannot discern. Consequently, we are in no position to endorse the minor premise (2) of the argument from evil because we cannot be more than agnostic about the accuracy of the premise. This conclusion would be an undercutting defeater for the premise because there would be no justification for the conclusion that evils in our world are gratuitous. To justify this conclusion, the skeptical theist argues that the limits of human cognitive faculties are grounds for skepticism about our ability to draw conclusions about God's motives or lack of motives; it is therefore reasonable to doubt the second premise.Skeptical Theism, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Formerly part of the Leven Valley benefice, together with St Anne Haverthwaite and St Mary Staveley-in-Cartmel, it is now part of the Cartmel Peninsula Team Ministry. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. St Peter's was designed by the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin. They were the winners of a competition to design \\"mountain chapels\\" organised by the Carlisle Church Extension Society in 1873. The authors of the Buildings of England series describe the church as \\"a brilliant essay\\", and write that \\"one would have to search far and search long in England to find village churches to vie with\\" this and two other Austin and Paley churches, Torver and Dolphinholme. The church stands to the southeast of the village. History The church was built in 1873‚Äì74 to replace a chapel dating from 1724‚Äì25. It was paid for by Thomas Newby Wilson of Newby Bridge, the proprietor of the Stott Park Bobbin Mill. The church provided seating for 200 people, and cost ¬£4,170 (). Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in coursed stone rubble with sandstone dressings. It has a slate roof and tiles on the ridges. Its architectural style is Norman. The plan consists of a four-bay nave, a north porch and a chancel. Between the nave and chancel is a tower. To the north of the tower is an organ chamber and a vestry. Along the side of the nave are round-headed lancet windows. At the west end are two windows, with a lancet window above them. The porch is timber framed on stone walls and has a gable. It leads to the round-headed entrance to the church. On the north and south sides of the tower are buttresses, and between them are projections. In the south projection is a lancet window, with a small window above it. There are two windows in the vestry. At the east end of the chancel are three windows, the central one being wider than the others, and a lancet window above them. On the gable of the east end is a cross finial. There are two windows on the south side of the chancel. On the upper part of the tower is a diamond-shaped clock face. The tower has a high pyramidal roof. On the north and south sides of the roof are louvred dormer windows, and on the east and west sides are stone dormers containing round-headed louvred bell openings. =Interior= The ceiling is painted with scrollwork, and with angels carrying copies of the Beatitudes. Around the nave and window arches are a stencilled frieze, part of which has been covered with whitewash. The reredos is made from alabaster and mosaic, it dates from 1883, and was made by Salviati. The rest of the furnishings were designed by the architects. These include the altar rails, the chancel floor, the pulpit, the lectern, and the font, which is made from fossiliferous marble. There is stained glass in the east and west windows by Shrigley and Hunt, that in the west windows containing musical quotations from Handel's Messiah. The two-manual organ was made by Jardine and company of Manchester in 1875.

Robert C. Reinehr and Jon D. Swartz, in their book, The A to Z of Old Time Radio, noted that the program differed from most others in its genre: \\"It was a more hard-boiled program than many of the other private detective shows of the time, containing few quips or quaint characters.\\" The program first aired 17 June 1947 on NBC radio under the title The New Adventures of Philip Marlowe, with Van Heflin playing Marlowe. The show was a summer replacement for Bob Hope. The first episode adapted Chandler's short story \\"Red Wind\\". The NBC series ended 9 September 1947. In 1948, the series moved to CBS, where it was called The Adventure of Philip Marlowe, with Gerald Mohr playing Marlowe. This series also began with an adaptation of \\"Red Wind\\", using a script different from the NBC adaptation. By 1949, it had the largest audience in radio. The CBS version ran for 114 episodes. That series ran 26 September 1948 ‚Äì 29 September 1950. From 7 July 1951 to 15 September 1951, the program was a summer replacement for Hopalong Cassidy. Mohr played Marlowe in all but one of the CBS shows. He was replaced by William Conrad in the 1950 episode, \\"The Anniversary Gift\\". The episode \\"The Birds On The Wing\\" (aired 11-26-49) is especially notable for its beginning and ending, both uncharacteristically breaking the fourth wall. It opens with Marlowe saying he is currently reading \\"Chandler's latest The Little Sister\\" ‚Äì thus a fictional character claims to be reading an actual book in which he is the main character. Even more surreal was the ending, in which Marlowe returns to his apartment to find Gracie Allen ‚Äì who asks Marlowe to find her husband George Burns a radio show on which he can sing! The program's composer was Lyn Murray, who worked in both film and radio at the time. Curiously enough, the musical cue that plays over the opening narration in the series' first two episodes (where Marlowe recites the opening sentences of Chandler's original story \\"Red Wind\\") is a theme that would reappear prominently in Murray's 1954 score for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"To Catch a Thief\\". Despite the program's popularity, it had no sponsor for most of its time on the air. The lone exceptions were when Ford Motor Company and, subsequently, Wrigley's Gum sponsored it during part of 1950.Dunning, John. (1976). Tune in Yesterday: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, 1925‚Äì1976. Prentice- Hall, Inc. . p. 12. Gene D. Phillips, in the book Creatures of Darkness: Raymond Chandler, Detective Fiction, and Film Noir, reported Chandler's lack of involvement with the program: \\"Initially Chandler had considered asking for script approval for the Marlowe radio series, but ultimately he decided to have no connection with the scripting of the programs. He contented himself with the weekly royalties he received for the use of his character, while professing himself 'moderately pleased' with Gerald Mohr's portrayal of Marlowe.\\" Cast and crew The first NBC episode had a script by Milton Geiger. Chandler, in a letter to Erle Stanley Gardner, commented about his version, \\"It was thoroughly flat.\\" The CBS version had a better reception. Norman Macdonnell was producer/director; Gene Levitt, Robert Mitchell, Mel Dinelli, and Kathleen Hite wrote the scripts; and Richard Aurandt was responsible for the music. Roy Rowan was announcer.

Her co-stars are James Craig and Jean Rogers. Plot Maisie Ravier loses her job as an assistant in Horatio Curley's dog act as a result of a minor quarrel with test pilot \\"Breezy\\" McLaughlin. Breezy gets Curley a job at the Victory Aircraft factory where he works and offers to use his influence on Maisie's behalf too. However, she insists she can get a job there on her own merits. She lands on the swing shift at the factory. Breezy does, however, get her a room at the boarding house owned by Maw Lustvogel. Despite her initial dislike for him, Maisie starts falling in love. Maisie stops a suicide attempt by failed actress Iris Reed, who lives across the hall, and persuades her to get a job in the same place. Her kindness backfires on her when Breezy is more attracted to Iris. The two soon become engaged. When Breezy gets his wish to join the United States Army Air Forces, he asks Maisie to look after Iris while he is away being trained. Maisie finds this a difficult task, as Iris turns out to like men altogether too much. When Iris gets fired, she uses her feminine charms to get Judd Evans, a factory clerk, to pay the rent for an apartment in his building. She skips out without paying Maw the back rent she owes, even though Maisie gives her $20 to do so, and she has just received a $100 money order from Breezy. Maisie finds Judd comforting Iris after another \\"suicide attempt\\". She orders Iris to tell Breezy that she no longer loves him when he comes home on leave to marry her. However, Iris secretly accuses Maisie of suspicious behavior to the factory's security department. While Maisie is being questioned, Iris and Breezy drive to Yuma, Arizona to get married. Maisie cleverly confesses to being a saboteur and implicates Iris and Breezy as fellow agents. They are stopped by the police, but let go after Breezy produces his identification. However, Breezy learns that Maisie is being held, even though Iris told him that she left to attend the funeral of an aunt. Having learned of Iris's shady character, Breezy goes back to Maisie. She is initially unwilling to take him back, but eventually gives in.

Unlike aircraft factory settings for other wartime films such as Captains of the Clouds (1942) that used the Lockheed Vega Burbank factory, Swing Shift Maisie was set in a fictitious \\"Victory Aircraft\\". MGM studios had bought two Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft for a film project on the air war in North Africa, simply titled \\"P-38\\". The project was never realized but one of the aircraft was featured in A Guy Named Joe (1943). The other P-38 appears in the factory scene in Swing Shift Maisie.

Her taste is not precisely refined. It runs to furbelows, bric-a-brac and ugly little dogs. Her conversation is not always as elegant as it aspires to be.

Early life Born in Poland, she moved to New Zealand at the age of eight and has lived in New York since 1998. Works Martynka Wawrzyniak's artistic evolution has drifted from photography and video to performance and installations, often bringing the viewer into a deeply intimate rapport with the artist-cum-subject. She is known for work that engages the senses, often while incorporating experimental techniques. Ziemia: Our Stories Are Written in Soil, 2018 Ziemia is a public-art project created in collaboration with residents of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY that was completed and installed in June 2018. In the form of a ceramic sphere atop a native meadow in McGolrick Park, the piece bridges divides between the neighborhood's disparate subcultures by serving as a collective portrait of the community through embodying residents' personal homelands and migration stories. Greenpoint is experiencing a demographic transformation as gentrification pushes out many longtime residents. With the rising displacement and relocation of peoples across the world, Ziemia responds to the need for collective reflection in communities on migration as not merely a global phenomenon, but as a local, micro experience that unites us all. The ceramic orb is glazed with a mixture of clay excavated in Greenpoint and soils contributed by participating residents from places that are symbolically representative of their identities, including: The United States, Poland, Ukraine, Germany, France, Japan, Serbia, Nepal, the United Kingdom, Ecuador, Mexico, and Namibia. The project includes many Poles who have lived in Greenpoint for generations, and Wawrzyniak personally traveled to Poland to collect soil on behalf of Polish residents who were unable to make the journey. With soil‚Äîuniversally symbolic for one's roots and identity‚Äîas the medium, Ziemia gestures to the primal connection to Earth that underlies each individual's migratory experience. As the transitional phase in nature between death and life, soil refers to the cyclical patterns of neighborhood growth and change. Wawrzyniak chose the materials specifically for their significance in Greenpoint's history. The meadow, composed of native and doppelg√§nger plant species, references Greenpoint's pastoral past as the once fertile land that sustained Native Americans and settlers. The international soil was imported with an official USDA soil importing permit and heat treated by a team of chemistry research students at Lehman College. The students have been important partners in the project and are conducting tests on the soils for mineral content as well as traces of pollution. The public art piece serves as a central location for events to encourage cross-cultural exchange and initiate dialog about immigration and the human relationship with the natural world. Ultimately, the project aims to bring attention to the ties, both sentimental and vital, that we have to the land we call home. Feed, 2014 For her Feed exhibition, at envoy enterprises, New York in September 2014 Wawrzyniak committed to a year-long daily exercise which involved the use of one identical 20 x 20 -inch white cloth dinner napkin to wipe her mouth each night at dinner. She then proceeded to file the napkins with a detailed record of the ingredients of what she ate. The project culminated in an exhibition of the 365 soiled napkins sewn together in chronological order in the form of an interlocking, two-spiral 100-foot walk-in structure hanging from the gallery ceiling. The sculpture was accompanied by a limited edition book in which a photograph of each soiled napkin is accompanied by a detailed list of ingredients. Elaborate three-course meals are boiled down to a scientific index, leaving the taste and visual image of the meal up to the viewer's imagination. The artist simultaneously collected 365 6 x 6 -inch paper lunch napkins, which she used to dab her mouth after her daily morning green juice. These paper napkins are arranged in twelve framed calendar formations, creating a visual record of time passing, much like a prisoner keeping track of time by drawing lines on the cell wall. Both pieces are tactile recordings of a daily performance, and in speaking about the months-long process, Wawrzyniak says: \\"I felt like I was sharing my meals with the public every day and made a conscious effort to be creative in my choice of ingredients. It was like having a daily dinner party. It becomes a tactile self-portrait, representing a year of my life recorded through the food that nourished me.\\" Furthermore, also included in the Feed exhibition were two small-scale sculptures: a casting of the negative space of the inside of the artist's mouth out of edible golden candy and the hollow of her abdomen out of confectionery gum paste. Like the stains left over from meals on the napkins these pieces are negative imprints of a living, breathing body. Smell Me, 2012 In her Smell Me exhibition at envoy enterprises, New York in fall 2012, Wawrzyniak created an installation reflecting a year-long project where she acted as both investigator and subject exploring and capturing her biological essence. Working with a research team of Hunter College Chemistry students: Paul Kozlowski, Charles Paszkowski, and Paul Tewfik, under the guidance of Professor Donna McGregor, the artist underwent multiple experiments to collect aromatic elements from her body. She was subject to rigorous sessions to extract the concentrated essence of her sweat, tears, and hair to create an olfactory-based self-portrait that would engage visitors in a visceral form of communication without visuality as primary form. In order to fully immerse the installation space with the scent of her bodily aromas, Wawrzyniak collaborated with the renowned professional perfumer Yann Vasnier of Givaudan and scent director Dawn Goldworm of 12.29 on synthetically reconstituting the organic essences for diffusion. These aromas were released inside a specially designed scent chamber into which visitors entered to partake in a solitary experience. A limited edition of the original organic essences were displayed in tear shaped chemistry vials as well as three candles that were made of paraffin that was scraped off Wawrzyniak's body then melted into 250 ml chemistry beakers. In an interview with New York Times Magazine, Wawrzyniak explains, \\"In today's society we do everything we can to mask the natural scent of our bodies, thus forgoing an ancient form of animal communication. I wanted to isolate these primal human essences and deliver them in an environment devoid of other sensual distractions. The piece represents the true essence of a woman - free of visual prejudice.\\" Eau De M, 2014 In 2014 she expanded the Smell Me olfactory self-portrait concept by exposing it to the wider public through guerilla advertising. The resultant piece, Eau De M, which consisted of the artist's sweat essence delivered by way of a magazine scent-strip fragrance advertisement, appeared as a double-sided insert in the full print run of the May 2014 issue of Harper's Bazaar. The advertisement became a vehicle for spreading her essence, letting the mass market consume her artwork unwittingly. Chocolate, 2011 In 2011, Wawyrzyniak released Chocolate, a 9-and-a-half minute performance video in which the artist's face is slowly submerged in 16 gallons of chocolate syrup. 4 Sale, 2010 In November 2010, she contributed to 4 Sale, a collaboration of four female artists exploring conceptions of eroticism using themselves as the subjects. Wawrzyniak's contribution was a photo series of the four artists naked except for a camera, and a video of the four applying lipstick first conventionally to their lips and then in deranged fashion to the rest of their faces. In a review of the show, Artinfo described Wawrzyniak as owing \\"an allegiance both to the vamping of pinup girls and straightforward commercial portraiture\\", and praised the project as a \\"serious, well-crafted, yet approachable work that isn't afraid to handle sexuality with a mix of humor, drama, and the occasional dash of mysticism\\". W magazine commented that Wawrzyniak \\"explores femininity with both brutality and warmth\\". your bitcoinKetchup, 2009 In 2009 Wawrzyniak performed Ketchup, in which she stood blind folded as four 10-year-old boys armed with water guns filled with ketchup fired at her as she stood against a gallery wall.

He was shot to death by motorcycle-borne sharpshooters on 11 June 2011. Career Dey started his career with Hindustan Times. A wildlife enthusiast, he first started writing on forest encroachment and the man-animal conflict in Borivali National Park. A story about government departments taking away land in the reserved national park created a furore in the state legislature. He started his journalistic career as a freelancer with Afternoon Despatch and Courier writing about crime in the wildlife areas. He also dabbled in photojournalism. He then started free lancing for Mid Day before joining them full-time. He joined Indian Express in 1996 and soon switched to covering crime stories, especially on Mumbai underworld. In 2005, he joined Hindustan Times. He later re-joined MiD Day as crime and investigations editor. Dey had authored two books on underworld activities, Zero Dial: The Dangerous World of Informers and Khallas. He has done many reports on underworld dons Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan. Personal life He is survived by his wife Shubha Sharma, also a journalist, and his mother Bina Dey.  Death  J Dey was returning to his home on his motorcycle from Ghatkopar after meeting his mother Bina Dey on 11 June 2011. Around 3 PM of the same day, four unidentified men on motorcycles opened fire on him at Hiranandani Gardens, Powai, Mumbai. He was taken to Powai Hospital, but they did not have the proper facilities to attend to him. Dey was later rushed to Hiranandani hospital. He was reported dead on arrival at the Hiranandani hospital, with nine exit wounds on his body. Mumbai Police speculated the murder was a professional job, and may be related to his reporting on the oil mafia. The oil mafia, which pilfers oil being transported and also dilutes it before sale, has been under pressure since the killing of Yashwant Sonawane in January 2011. Dey had also recently reported that Chhota Rajan was the mastermind behind a recent shooting involving Dawood Ibrahim‚Äôs brother Iqbal Kaskar in Mumbai. The murder was widely denounced by the press and the local government. BBC News Jun 13,2011 \\"underlines the increasing threat investigative journalists are being subjected to by powerful political and business interests indulging in illegal acts\\", the Mumbai Press Club said in a statement.  Police investigation  The investigation of J Dey's murder was handed over to the Crime Branch Department of Mumbai Police. Media persons from across different sections demanded that the investigations should be handed over to the CBI. Several media persons met the state's chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, to put forth their demand of handing over the case to the CBI. The chief minister remained adamant that the integrity of Mumbai Police should not be underestimated and the police should be given time to crack the case. On 27 June 2011, after sixteen days of investigations, the Crime Branch declared they have cracked the case. Police officials caught seven people from different locations of India. Of which three were detained from Chembur, in Mumbai; one in Solapur; and remaining two from Rameshwaram, in Tamil Nadu.http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/story/j-dey-murder-case-cracked-mumbai- police/1/142827.html All the suspects reside in different parts of Mumbai except Satish Kalia, who settled down in Trivandrum after the birth of his daughter and cases against him were cleared. After the shootout they fled to evade arrest. All the seven suspects Rohit Thangappan Joseph alias Satish Kalia, Arun Dake, Anil Waghmode, Bablu, Sachin Gaikwad, Mangesh Agawane and Chotu are history-sheeters. The suspects were allegedly from Chhota Rajan gang. Additional Police Commissioner (Crime) Himanshu Roy, who was supervising the case said in a press conference that Chhota Rajan approached Satish Kalia who in turn organised the team to carry the shootout. Satish Kalia was the man who shot J Dey, said the police. The commissioner also added the shootout was carried out on the behest of Chhota Rajan, and the shooters were allegedly kept in dark about the profession of Jyotirmoy Dey.http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=local&newsid;=247655 On 21 February 2012, Mumbai Crime Branch chargesheeted journalist Jigna Vora (Deputy Chief of Bureau of Asian Age) under stringent provisions of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) and various other penal offences for her alleged role in the sensational murder. Besides the stringent provisions of MCOCA and the Arms Act she has also been charged under various sections of IPC including criminal conspiracy, murder and destruction of evidence. Jigna Vora had been under the Mumbai police's radar since 4 July 2011 after the police intercepted a conversation between Manoj, brother of Vinod Asrani, who has also been arrested and the gangster Chhota Rajan. The police alleged that Vora had supplied address and licence plate number of Dey's motorcycle to Chhota Rajan. Police claimed Vora's professional rivalry was the reason for Dey's murder. On 27 July 2012, Jigna Vora was granted bail by a special court reasoning that she has a child to look after and is a single parent and that she had no previous criminal record.

The film stars Connor Jessup as a socially isolated and bullied goth teenager who befriends his \\"puck bunny\\" classmate (Alexia Fast), but is falsely accused of plotting a school shooting after he makes a threat against her boyfriend in an online chat session.\\"TIFF Preview #1\\". Cinemascope. Plot Sean Randall (Connor Jessup), a goth teenager, is a friend of classmate Deanna (Alexia Fast), with whom he rides the bus every day. Her boyfriend plays in an ice hockey team and she is friends with the team's other members. Sean's father has a gun collection, and Sean sometimes joins him when he goes hunting. Sean films his father shooting a deer and shows the footage to his schoolmates, which (when combined with his goth fashion sense) makes them think that he is creepy. The members of the hockey team bully Sean for being weird and for being friends with Deanna, which angers Sean. Sean's teacher advises him to write down his feelings. He writes a revenge story about using his father's guns on the hockey team and Deanna, which he publishes on the Internet, although he has no real intention to harm anybody. He is put into a youth detention center, where inmates also bully him especially Trevor (Alex Ozerov), who has served the longest time there after an incident as a child in which he killed a Santa Claus impersonator who displayed an inappropriate sexual interest in him. Sean is punished for lying about why he is in jail; the others steal his food and he is forced to fetch the ball whenever Trevor plays ping pong with the others. Tired of Trevor, Sean crushes the ping pong ball and Trevor threatens to kill him. Sean then deliberately commits an offence by withholding some cutlery in order to be put in the isolation ward. To be released from the jail sooner, he reluctantly follows his lawyer's advice to plead guilty for planning a school shooting, even though he had no such plans. He is indeed released, under the condition that he does not have any contact with Deanna or the hockey team members. He avoids his previous goth look, but people still consider him weird and dangerous, and his car is vandalized. Sean violates the condition of having no contact with Deanna and is arrested again. With his father's support, he decides to dismiss his lawyer and tell the truth, after which he is sentenced for perjury in the previous trial. He is returned to juvenile jail, where Trevor convinces one of his friends to murder Sean, but the attempt fails. Later on, it is Christmas time, which makes Trevor uncomfortable. Sean angers Trevor by suggesting that the Santa Claus he killed might have thought that Trevor looked gay. This results in a fight, after which both of them are put in the isolation ward. Trevor is still very angry and hurts himself, causing increasing security measures by prison staff. Sean is relieved that Trevor is no longer in a position to bully him. One day, he does not have to stay in the isolation ward any longer, but prefers to and is allowed to stay while Trevor is still there. Sean begins to feel sympathy for him, and they reconcile.

It inhabits shallow pools, including the highest body of water ever to have yielded a crustacean, at an altitude of in the Andes. It was described independently by two scientists in 1955, using material brought back by different European expeditions to the same region. Description Males of B. palustris are long, and females . The antennules are relatively short. B. palustris can be distinguished from other members of the genus Boeckella by the form of the fifth leg in males. Distribution and ecology Boeckella palustris has a P√°ramo‚ÄìPunan distribution, being found in southern Peru, and close to the border between Bolivia and Chile. It lives in \\"small, shallow bodies of water\\", a habitat it shares with Boeckella calcaris. Boeckella palustris shares the record for the crustacean living at the highest altitude with the fairy shrimp Branchinecta brushi; both were found on December 13, 1988 in the same pool at an altitude of near the summit of the stratovolcano Cerro Paniri () in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. The only higher record, which claimed that Branchinecta paludosa occurred at is \\"almost certainly a typographical error\\". Taxonomy Boeckella palustris was originally described as Pseudoboeckella palustris by John Philip Harding in 1955, using material gathered by the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition to Lake Titicaca in 1937. The genus Pseudoboeckella was subsumed into Boeckella in 1992 by Ian A. E. Bayly of Monash University, Australia, as no reliable character could be found to distinguish the two. The species was independently described as Pseudoboeckella peruviensis in 1955 by Heinz L√∂ffler using material from a 1953‚Äì1954 expedition to the Andes under Hans Kinzl, but Harding's description has priority, having been published on July 29, 1955, eleven weeks before L√∂ffler's paper was read, on October 13, 1955.

He was Deputy Premier of Victoria in John Cain's government from 1982 to 1989.Fordham, Robert Clive, Re-Member, Parliament of Victoria. Early life and education Fordham was born in Melbourne and attended Footscray North Primary School and Essendon High School before studying commerce and arts at the University of Melbourne. He worked as an accountant, and joined the Commonwealth Public Service Board in 1968. He is the brother of Jan Friedl (1947‚Äì2017), an actress known for her work as Matron Gribble on Round the Twist. Political career Fordham unsuccessfully ran as a candidate for the electorate of Syndal in the 1967 Victorian election, but was elected as member for Footscray in the subsequent election in 1970. In that same year, he was made parliamentary spokesperson on fuel, power and the arts; later, for education and federal affairs. In 1977, he was made deputy leader of the Labor Party in Victoria and deputy opposition leader under Frank Wilkes and John Cain. In the 1982 election, John Cain led Labor to victory after thirty years in opposition. Fordham became Deputy Premier, and was also given the portfolios of education and educational services in Cain's cabinet. After the 1985 election, Fordham and Ian Cathie swapped portfolios, with Fordham becoming Minister for Industry, Technology and Resources. =VEDC affair= As industry minister, Fordham oversaw the operation of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (VEDC), a government agency originally established by Rupert Hamer's Liberal government in 1981, but which was restructured by the Labor government in 1984 to stimulate economic activity in Victoria by providing loan and equity funds to certain companies. In October 1987, the VEDC became involved in the proposed public float of Wallace International, a pharmaceutical company. Despite a global stock market slump following \\"Black Monday\\", Wallace proceeded with its float, which then failed, causing the float's underwriters to withdraw from their commitment. In early November 1987, Wallace applied to the VEDC to sub-underwrite the float, and received correspondence from Fordham agreeing to the VEDC acting as sub-underwriter, making further loans to the company, and purchasing $2 million worth of shares. By the close of the float in January 1989, Wallace's failure to attract investors saw the company call up the VEDC's sub-underwriting agreement in February. The VEDC board met on 19 February, where they were informed of Fordham's agreement with the company for the first time, which it was required to endorse. Despite the funding injection from VEDC, Wallace recorded a loss of around $17.5 million, and in November 1988 the VEDC instituted legal action alleging misleading and deceptive conduct, and seeking the recovery of the $15 million it had invested. The problems continued with several other VEDC clients going into receivership. The opposition seized upon the agency's failures, and called for Fordham's resignation and a royal commission into the affair. The government appointed accountant Fergus Ryan to conduct an inquiry into the VEDC's finances, management and investments. Ryan's report was released on 21 December 1988, finding that the VEDC had accumulated bad debts of $112 million. Fordham's appointments to the VEDC board were criticised, as were his agreements with Wallace which were seen to have caused the agency to have \\"entered into an agreement beyond its powers\\". An election had been held in October 1988 in which Cain's government had been re-elected, losing one lower house seat and control of the upper house. Cain re-shuffled his cabinet, moving Fordham to the Agriculture and Rural Affairs, and Arts portfolios. Despite further opposition pressure over the VEDC affair, and speculation that Fordham would be forced to resign, Premier Cain backed his deputy, as did the Labor Unity faction of which Fordham was a member. During January, however, Fordham's support within the party dissipated. In particular, the Socialist Left faction had a cross-faction agreement to provide the next deputy premier, and worked actively to force Fordham to resign. He stood down on 31 January 1989, and a week later the caucus elected Joan Kirner to replace him as Deputy Premier. Fordham served out the rest of his parliamentary term on the backbench, and did not contest the 1992 election. After politics Since leaving politics, Fordham has worked as a consultant and has been active in several organisations in the East Gippsland region, including as Chairperson of East Gippsland WaterWater Plant Council, WIN News, 25 June 2010. and a council member of East Gippsland Institute of TAFE.Membership: Ministerial Advisory Committee on the TAFE Development Centre, TAFE Development Centre.

Bevan now lives in Nesodden, Akershus, Norway. John Bevan was born in Catshill, England, and showed interest for music at the early age of eight years, starting on the violin at Catshill Junior school. After a 3-year period, his interests were directed to the clarinet. At 12 years old, he was accepted as a part-time student at the Birmingham School of Music. He was fortunate to have received professional tuition from members of both Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (James Mathewson) and BBC Light Orchestra (Michael Saxton). His initial interests were directed towards classical music, and he was very active with several local amateur orchestras and also a regular feature in the theatre pit orchestras in the Birmingham area. Achievements At the age of 14, John was an original member of the newly formed Worcestershire County Youth Orchestra under the batons of Eric Holt and Arther Benoy. At the age of 19 he was performed solo with the orchestra Concertino for Clarinet and Strings by Gorden Jacob at Kidderminster Town Hall. During this period, John also showed interest in the lighter side of music; he purchased his first alto saxophone at the age of 16. This was unique as it was an instrument made with plastic by the name of Grafton Acrylic. This was soon traded in after a 2-year period for the best instrument on the market at the time ‚Äì a Selmer Mark VI Alto which he still owns. This instrument is now rated as the Stradivarius of saxophones by experienced players. A Dearmann baritone saxophone was also added to his collection of instruments which opened the market for him in many big bands of the time. Conscription In 1959, he was conscripted into the army stationed at Woolwich, London, as a musician in the Royal Artillery Staff Band. This was short-lived due to a compassionate discharge owing to the unexpected death of his father at a very early age. This did not quell his interest for music, however, and he formed the John Bevan Quartet, which became popular in the Birmingham area and also was the regular feature at the Perry Hall Hotel, Bromsgrove for many years. Classical music at this time was not the forefront of his musical activities but an opportunity presented itself in 1962 when the Bromsgrove Music Festival invited him to perform. With able assistance from the Bromsgrove String Orchestra under the conductorship of Joseph Stones he performed Richard Strauss's Duo Concerto for Bassoon and Clarinet'.' John was honored to partner with Harold Evans, principle bassoonist with the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Move to Norway After an 8-year period living at Windmill Avenue, Rubery, John and his wife, Joan, left England in 1969 with their two children, Andrew and Colin, and took up residence in Norway. Within a short period he was invited to join the Nesodden Amateur Orchestra. Within a four-year period he conducted the local youth and school bands and also the Oslo Post Office orchestra. From the connections he had established with local musicians he formed an eighteen piece combination which later became known as the John Bevan Big Band. From these very basic beginnings the band enjoyed a great deal of success in a relatively short time. It established a working arrangement with NADU (Norway's Amateur Dancing Association) and performed on several occasions for their National Championships. In 1978 Norway was allocated the World Championship in Latin American Dancing and the Bevan band were honoured to be chosen for this prestigious arrangement. Norway took both second and third places in this competition. In 1980 Norway hosted the Paralympic Winter Games where the orchestra once again showed its skills in the international field. In August 1986 the band was dealt a terrible blow. On returning from vacation after celebrating their Silver Wedding anniversary they were informed that Oslo's Rainbow Restaurant, the building where they would usually rehearse, had a serious fire which virtually damaged everything within. The band's library of music was completely destroyed with the exception of the performing folders which were located at another store. This saved them and they got many new engagements. The library at that time had a total of 750 arrangements which is now somewhat depleted to a total of 550. Due to their constant achievements the orchestra became very much in demand and developed to become one of Norway's leading and most extensively used orchestras. With this success it captivated the interest of many professional musicians, and the quality of the band also benefited from this. Many of the top Norwegian and international artists were accompanied; Georgie Fame, Vera Lynn, Kenny Clare, Jack Dailey, Jan Harrington, Lill Babs, Lennart Hyland, Garry Allcock and Putte Wickman are just some of the artists who performed with the band. Jimmy Staples, correspondent with the English jazz magazine Crescendo, was not only performing himself but also provided some excellent scores for the orchestra. The orchestra was constantly engaged for dance occasions and broadcast transmissions for Norwegian radio and TV. In cooperation with arranger Erling Wicklund, the John Bevan Big Band produced their one and only LP entitled \\"The Great Walt Disney Film Tunes.\\" This was extremely well received due to the professional expertise of Erling Wicklund, and Norway's leading jazz critic, Stein Kagge, gave the record top marks for the final production with the heading \\"a Norwegian Big Band in an international class\\". Another milestone in their history was in 1984, when they were invited to perform for the Istanbul Music Festival accompanying the local Turkish vocalist IBO in the Istanbul Opera House.

Plot Countess Tanya Vronsky acts as bait for notorious jewel thief Andre Desormeaux and his assistant, Polo, on their tour through Europe. Everything goes according to plan until Tanya falls in love with their next target, Paul Vernay. Still, the gang manages to victimize Paul. After the heist, Tanya announces that she is retiring and goes on to marry Paul. Desormeaux tries to convince her to change her mind, but in vain. They meet again months later in Paris, and Desormeaux makes another attempt at persuading the countess to work with them again. In order to get rid of them for good, she pretends to go along with their plans, but instead sets them up to be caught. However, her plan is thwarted, and her two accomplices come to her home during a party and pretend to be guests. They manage to steal the guests' jewels and escape. Before they leave, Desormeaux blackmails Tanya, threatening to tell Paul about her past if he does not get 200,000 francs. The theft is soon discovered, and Paul and Tanya go after the thieves in their car. On the way, Paul learns about Tanya's background and forgives her. While they are away, Polo returns to their house in a sudden change of heart, and gives back the jewels. Meanwhile, Desormeaux is boarding a ship to America.

Biography He studied at the T√ºbinger Stift in T√ºbingen, and from 1840 to 1847 served as an assistant pastor in Dettingen an der Erms and as a pastor in H√ºlben.ADB:Zimmermann, Wilhelm at Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie From 1847 to 1850, Zimmermann taught history at the Oberrealscule in Stuttgart. He was a democrat in philosophy and belief. Accordingly, he took part in the revolutionary uprising in Germany in 1848 through 1849. In 1848, he was elected as a deputy to the Frankfurt National Assembly. At assembly, he caucused with the \\"Left wing\\" deputies. In 1850, Zimmermann was dismissed from his position as a teacher at the Oberrealschule because of his participation in the revolution of 1848-1849 and because of his caucusing with the Left wing in the Frankfurt Assembly. Zimmermann died in 1878.Biographical note contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels (International Publishers: New York, 1978) p. 739. In 1841‚Äì1843, he published the 3-volume Allgemeine Geschichte des gro√üen Bauernkrieges (General History of the Great Peasant War). Vegetarianism Zimmermann became a vegetarian in 1839 and lived at Alcott House, a vegetarian and utopian socialist community in 1840.Treitel, Corinna. (2017). Eating Nature in Modern Germany: Food, Agriculture and Environment, c.1870 to 2000. Cambridge University Press. pp. 41-42. In 1843, he authored the book Der Weg zum Paradies (The Way to Paradise). The book argued that Europe had fallen in moral and physical decline because people had broken the \\"laws of nature\\" by consuming meat, overdressing and treating disease with poisons. To reverse the process, Zimmermann recommended people to \\"return to nature\\" by eating natural plant foods. The book introduced German readers to ancient and modern vegetarian literature. It sold well and went through four editions by the end of the century.

The Simon Power Plant is the principal energy provider to the 45,000-student main campus, meeting approximately 97% of all energy demand. Pressurized steam is distributed throughout the campus through an extensive network of tunnels to provide both heating and cooling to approximately 500 instructional, research, and residential buildings located on more than . Electrical power is distributed through the same tunnels, making the campus relatively immune from outages due to weather. The primary fuel for T. B. Simon is natural gas; with the 1993 addition of Unit No. 4 the plant acquired the capability of burning biofuel. Simon's east smokestack identifies its operator with the letters M S U in white brick.  History  The Simon facility is the fifth power plant to be located on the Michigan State campus. Its six generating units were built in four stages:http://pp.msu.edu/index.cfm/power-and-water/a-brief-history-of- the-tb-simon-power-plant/ * 1965 - Units No. 1 and No. 2 - Dry bottom, wall- fired (coal, natural gas) * 1973 - Unit No. 3 - Dry bottom, wall-fired (coal, natural gas) * 1993 - Unit No. 4 - Circulating fluidized bed (coal, natural gas, blended coal/biofuel) * 2006 - Unit No. 5 - Dry bottom, wall-fired (coal, natural gas) * 2006 - Unit No. 6 - Natural Gas fired turbine with dry low-NOx burner (natural gas)2009 EIA-860 http://www.eia.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/eia860.html The $23 million 2006 addition was a Best In Class combined cycle plant consisting of a conventional pulverized-coal steam turbine/generator (Unit 5) and a natural gas combustion turbine with heat-recovery steam turbine (Unit 6). Unit 6 gives the Simon plant Black start capability in the event of a general power outage.http://www.christmanco.com/portfolio.asp?id=68&cat;_id=30  Capacity  Each successive cogeneration unit has been of higher electrical generating capacity than its predecessors. Unless otherwise noted, nameplate, summer, and winter capacities are the same: * Unit 1 - 12.5 MWh * Unit 2 - 12.5 MWh * Unit 3 - 15 MWh * Unit 4 - 21 MWh * Unit 5 - nameplate 24 MWh, summer/winter 23.8 MWh * Unit 6 - nameplate/winter 14.3 MWh, summer 12.6 MWh Total nameplate capacity is 99.3 MWh.  Fuel  As of 2016, MSU's Simon Plant no longer burns coal, but operates entirely on natural gas. Prior to 2016, MSU's Simon plant burned approximately 250,000 tons of low-sulfur Eastern coal, principally from Kentucky, and also burned biofuels to supplement coal.  Technology  Units 1-5 are cogeneration units, which produced superheated steam at 900 psi which is used to drive a turbine/generator, emerging at 90 psi for distribution to campus buildings through a system of tunnels. Steam condensate is returned from campus to the plant via the same tunnels to be cleaned and reused. Since both usable steam and electricity are produced in a single process, the combined energy efficiency is approximately 60 percent, twice that of an electric-only unit.http://pp.msu.edu/index.cfm/power-and-water/green-issues/ Unit 6 is an electric generator only with no cogeneration capacity.  Steam tunnels  There are more than of steam tunnels under the MSU campus. Access points are locked and unmarked, and University Ordinance 15.09 bans anyone from entering except for \\"performance of assigned university duties.\\" James Dallas Egbert III, a gifted but troubled 16-year-old MSU student, entered the steam tunnels on August 15, 1979 with the intention of committing suicide there. News reports of his disappearance erroneously claimed that Egbert had gotten lost in the tunnels while playing a real-life version of Dungeons & Dragons. Portions of the 2003 independent film Terror at Baxter U, written by MSU professor Bill Vincent, were filmed in the steam tunnels below Berkey Hall.  Emissions and environment  The Simon plant is operated under permits from the Michigan Department of Environment Quality.http://www.deq.state.mi.us/maers/emissions_query_results.asp?SRN=k3249&Facility;_Name=michigan+state+university&EI;_Year=&City;=&County;=&AQD;_District=&cmdSubmit;=Submit+Query Though Unit 4's fluidized bed combustion produces more efficient burning at a lower temperature and Units No. z5 and 6 only burn natural gas, the plant remains a significant emitter of several pollutants, and the principal source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on campus: * CO2 (Carbon dioxide) - 542,606 tons (2009) * SOx (sulfur oxides) - 2,812 tons (2009) * NOx (nitrogen oxides) - 811 (2009) * PM10 (particulates) - 12 tons (2009)http://pp.msu.edu/index.cfm/power-and-water/energy-sources/facts-and- statistics/ with MSU receiving a 2009 permit to burn up to 4,000 tons of wood and switchgrass annually. In 2011, the university requested permits covering an additional 24,000 tons of biofuel per year.http://pp.msu.edu/index.cfm/power-and-water/green-issues/#sustainability In 2010, MSU was fined $27,000 by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) for two 2008 violations of its operating permit: the burning of wet coal, which resulted in excessive NOx emissions; and the improper blending of coal, which resulted in excess sulfur dioxide emissions. \\"MSU Beyond Coal,\\" a campaign launched in 2010 in association with the Sierra Club, is lobbying the university to transition \\"away from coal to 100% clean, renewable energy sources.\\"http://msubeyondcoal.wordpress.com/ Student activists are trying to leverage the school's own \\"Be Spartan Green\\" environmental-consciousness initiativehttp://www.bespartangreen.msu.edu/ to pressure the university into committing to a target date for giving up coal.The Green and the Black http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-5519-the-green-and-the- black.html MSU joined the Chicago Climate Exchange in 2006, promising a 6% decrease in emissions by 2010 and a 15% decrease by 2015 (versus a 2000 benchmark). The plant receives emissions credits when operating Units 5 and 6 due to their clean-burning natural-gas boilers.http://www.bespartangreen.msu.edu/content/documents/decisionaidtoreduceghgs.pdf While emission targets can also be addressed by managing demand, as of 2006 the MSU campus already had the lowest per-capita and per-square foot energy consumption in the Big Ten.http://news.jrn.msu.edu/ejmagazine/2011/05/02/big- ten-mini-cities-create-big-impact/ \\"Green\\" power initiatives on the MSU campus include solar panels on the new MSU Surplus and Recycling Center (2009) and geothermal heating for the Life Sciences Addition (2010).http://www.energytransition.msu.edu/documents/EnergyInitiatives_History.pdf  Predecessors  The Simon plant supplanted the smaller Shaw Lane Power Plant, built in 1948 and located adjacent to Spartan Stadium. Coal was delivered to Shaw via a Pere Marquette railroad spur on the west side of the building. Shaw Lane was deactivated as a power plant in 1975, though it continued to house an electrical substation. The plant's smokestack bearing the letters M S C (for Michigan State College) in white brick was a campus landmark until it was deemed unsafe and demolished between May and June 2011. It was announced in June 2018 that the remaining part of the plant would be reused as part of the construction of the $72.5 million STEM Teaching and Learning Facility. The North Campus Power Plant, which stood on what is now the lawn of the Administration Building, was built in 1921 and razed in 1966 after the Simon plant became operational. Its smokestack bore the letters M A C, for Michigan Agricultural College. The 1904 Boiler House was the first designed from the outset to provide both steam and electric power (the MSU campus was electrified beginning in 1895). Some of underground steam and power distribution tunnels were built at the same time, the beginning of the infrastructure still in use. The 1904 Boiler House had a round, tall smokestack, and received its coal by means of a trestle over the Red Cedar River. MSU's original 1882 Boiler House was built in the wake of a series of fires caused by the wood-fired stoves and furnaces used to heat early campus buildings. Electrical generation equipment was added in 1894. The 1882 Boiler House had a square, tall smokestack.http://kevinforsyth.net/ELMI/power.htm See also * List of power stations in Michigan * Global warming  References   External links  * MSU Physical Plant - Power & Water * MDEQ 2008 Facility Report for Michigan State University * Be Spartan Green * Energy Transition Plan Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1965 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1973 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1993 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2006 Category:Coal-fired power stations in Michigan Category:Michigan State University ","title":"T.

With a fiscal horsepower of 10 CV, and a wheel base of 2670 mm, it competed in the same sector as the Citro√´n B2 and Renault KZ. The car was derived from the Peugeot Type 173, from which it inherited its mechanical components and with which it shared both its overall dimensions and, when launched in 1924, its 1,525 cc ohv in-line four-cylinder engine. Claimed maximum power output was 29 hp at 1,900 rpm. The car was available in three different equipment levels, designated B, BH and BL. A year after the launch, in 1925, of the Type 177, the Type 173 was delisted and the newer model took its place. Also in 1925 the company launched the Peugeot Type 181, broadly similar to the 177, but with a slightly larger 1,615 cc engine for which a maximum power output of 30 hp and maximum speed of 75 km/h (47 mph) were given. At the end of 1926 production of the three original versions of the 177 B came to an end. 16,039 had been produced. A replacement 177 was launched at the start of 1927, in the shape of the 177 M. The 177 M of 1927 was of particular interest because of its transparent roof, a feature which would become widespread as an option on many cars only some fifty years later. This was replaced for the 1929 model year at the 22nd Paris Motor Show in October 1928 by the 177 R. The wheelbase was slightly longer at 2695 mm. Shortly afterwards the power unit was also changed, new cars featuring a smaller engine of 1,393 cc. This distanced the 177 from the more powerful Peugeot 181, leaving the new Type 177 with a maximum power output of only 25 hp, which was nevertheless sufficient to support a listed top speed of 70 km/h (44 mph). The 177 and more powerful 181 were commercially successful, with more than 40,000 177s produced. The 100,000th Peugeot produced was a Type 181, which was one of the last cars produced at the company‚Äôs Audincourt plant. Type 181 production continued until 1928, by when 9,259 had been produced. The Type 177 continued to be offered for one more year, powered in its final year by larger the 1,615 cc engine hitherto reserved for the Type 181. By the time Type 177 production ended in 1929, a further 18,202 had been built. References and sources * Wolfgang Schmarbeck: Alle Peugeot Automobile 1890-1990. Motorbuch-Verlag. Stuttgart 1990.

Based on the Australian SBS One series of the same name, it stars Elijah Wood and series co-creator Jason Gann, reprising his role of the eponymous dog. The series was adapted for the American television channel FX by Family Guy veteran David Zuckerman, and moved to FXX for its fourth and final season. Episodes The show follows a young man named Ryan (Elijah Wood) and his neighbor's dog Wilfred (Jason Gann). In the opening episode, Ryan concocts a drug cocktail to commit suicide. After this failed attempt, Ryan's neighbor, Jenna (Fiona Gubelmann), knocks on his door to ask him to look after Wilfred, whom Ryan sees and hears as a man in a dog costume. Cast =Main= * Elijah Wood as Ryan Newman; a timid ex-shark lawyer. He begins the series with harsh depression and suicidal thoughts. He continues to be clingy and dependent with Wilfred, and harbors an unrequited love for Jenna. Ryan often does things that Wilfred encourages him to do. * Jason Gann as Wilfred; a foul mouthed and blunt Australian accented shepherd dog that Ryan sees as a man in a dog suit but everyone else sees as a real dog, loves his owner Jenna, and is cocky and jealous of well-behaved dogs. He has a love of stuffed animals, in particular Bear & Raffi. Bear is his codependent giant stuffed teddy bear in Ryan's basement. Raffi is a stuffed giraffe that Wilfred courts by conning Ryan into whoring himself to a desperate executive woman whose car he hit. As the series progresses, Wilfred is often torn between his love for Bear and his lust for Raffi. In the series final he dies and is revealed to be made up in Ryan‚Äôs head. * Fiona Gubelmann as Jenna Mueller. A charming TV personality, she sometimes gets caught in the cross hairs of Wilfred and Ryan's shenanigans. She is constantly trying to make things work out with her on-again-off-again beau Drew. * Dorian Brown as Kristen Newman; Ryan's sister, single mom, seemingly dependent on Ryan, as pointed out by Wilfred. She is hostile and rude towards people, especially Ryan. She gets pregnant and has a baby named Joffrey in the second season. =Recurring= * Chris Klein as Drew, Jenna‚Äôs easygoing and lighthearted but competitive boyfriend and later husband. Wilfred despises him despite his good relationship with Ryan. * Allison Mack as Amanda (season 2; guest season 4), Ryan's co-worker and love interest. * Gerry Bednob as Mr. Patel (season 1; guest season 3), Ryan‚Äôs Indian neighbor who is rude. * J. P. Manoux as Leo (season 1), Kristen‚Äôs obnoxious and estranged husband who disapproves of her job as a Doctor who leaves her when she tells him of her affair with Dr. Ramos. * Rodney To as Dr. Bangachon * Rob Riggle as Kevin (season 2), Ryan‚Äôs friendly and easygoing co-worker. * Steven Weber as Jeremy (season 2), Ryan‚Äôs boss at his new job who kills himself after their secrets are stolen by a rival company. * Harriet Sansom Harris as Lonnie Goldsmith (season 4) Production =Development= Wilfred is based on the critically acclaimed Australian series of the same name and was adapted for FX by Family Guy veteran David Zuckerman. Wilfred is produced by FX Productions while the executive producers include: Zuckerman; Rich and Paul Frank; Jeff Kwatinetz; and Joe and Ken Connor from the original Australian series. Wilfred co-creator Jason Gann and Randall Einhorn serve as co-executive producers. Einhorn directed 10 episodes of the first season and Victor Nelli, Jr. directed three. The pilot episode was filmed in summer 2010, written by Zuckerman, and directed by Einhorn. Unlike the Australian version‚Äîwhich concentrated equally on Wilfred, his owner, and her boyfriend‚Äîthe American version is presented as a buddy comedy between Wilfred and Ryan. =Adapting the Australian series= There was interest in continuing the series on SBS, including talk about a possible film. However, Renegade Film, the company that produced the original Australian series, was unable to sell it in its original version to any other countries. Gann left to create an entirely new series for the US that used the format of the original and additional Australian seasons were not pursued. Gann was initially hesitant to make a US series stating, \\"I had no interest in making the same show again, just surrounded by people with different accents.\\" However, the show in the US differed greatly from the original series. When the show moved to the US, head writer and show creator Jason Gann took a more advisory role in the writers room, only writing six episodes of the show's four season run. Gann has noted that writing the US version was more taxing than writing the Australian version. His pitches often got rejected and ultimately in the transition he gave up a lot of creative control. This resulted in departing from the Australian series in several ways. When David Zuckerman took over the series he expressed that the show's lack of international appeal was due to a lack of clear rules that the fantasy elements of the show could follow. He made it a priority to set and follow certain rules in the new series. In reworking the character of Wilfred and his relationship with Ryan for an American audience, Gann used the film My Bodyguard as a reference point. The show took on a much more lighthearted and hopeful tone as the original series was often cited as being extremely cynical. The show was pitched to Gann as a different vehicle for the same character he played in the Australian version. Because the character was so crude, and because he'd have to be in a dog suit all the time, Gann originally didn‚Äôt want to play Wilfred. However, he feels the character is actually very different from Australian version having a lot more sides and overall \\"more fun.\\" On more than one occasion Gann has suggested that part of the reason the show had poor ratings in the US was because the show got bogged down in mythology and at times made comedy secondary stating, \\"Season Three, we really tried to steer it back closer to where we were Season One, and make it really comedically satisfying. I really felt we achieved that, but it wasn‚Äôt enough, I guess.\\" After the close of the final season in the US, Gann has considered going back and doing a third Australian season. =Casting= The casting of Elijah Wood as Ryan was announced on June 29, 2010. Ryan is described as \\"an introverted and troubled young man struggling unsuccessfully to make his way in the world until he forms a unique friendship with Wilfred, his neighbor's canine pet.\\" Series co-creator Jason Gann also reprises his role of the eponymous dog Wilfred, a character described by Zuckerman as being a mixed breed dog who is \\"part Labrador Retriever and part Russell Crowe on a bender\\". Fiona Gubelmann stars as Jenna, Wilfred's owner and Ryan's next-door neighbor, who works as a local news producer. Dorian Brown was then cast as Kristen, Ryan's controlling and condescending older sister. =Filming= Wilfred was initially shot using a DSLR, the Canon 7D, using a three camera setup. The show was later shot with a DSLR, the Nikon D800.\\"Wilfred adds Nikon D800 it's hdslr mix\\" on Creativeplanetnetwork.com, article of 17 September 2012, online the 8 January 2014 Reception Critical reception of the US adaptation of Wilfred was comparable to that of the original Australian series, with generally positive reviews. Review aggregation website Metacritic gives season 1 of the series an average score of 67 out of 100 based on reviews from 25 critics. Curt Wagner, writing in Redeye (The Chicago Tribune), said \\"Stuffed with absurd situations and piles of bad taste, Wilfred is the strangest new show on TV. And the funniest.\\" David Wiegand, in the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote, \\"Wilfred works on many levels, something that may not become apparent until after you stop laughing.\\" Some of the less positive reviews included Mike Hale, who wrote in The New York Times: \\"Some shows aspire to cult status; this one goes straight there, practically bypassing the need to be broadcast at all,\\" but concluded: \\"Gann's bits of doggie business ... are reliably humorous, but beyond that the show doesn‚Äôt offer a lot of bark or bite.\\" Tom Gliatto of People Magazine also gave a less positive review, calling the show \\"The Odd Couple redefined by psychosis and whimsy. I'm not wagging my tail.\\" The series premiere hit a positive note with viewers as it became the highest- ranking debut sitcom ever for FX Networks. It continued to remain in the top 10 shows for Thursday night cable television throughout the first season. It was picked up for a second season on August 6, 2011. The second season aired from June 21 to September 20, 2012. On October 31, 2012, Wilfred was renewed for Season 3, which aired from June 20 to September 5, 2013. On October 2, Wilfred was renewed for a fourth and final season, which aired from June 25 to August 13, 2014. Possible film In an October 2013 interview, Jason Gann noted that a possible film is out of his hands, but if fans wanted it, he could see the show coming back in a streaming capacity much like Arrested Development. In a June 2014 interview, Gann stated that he and Elijah Wood would be interested in a Wilfred film \\"if the story is there‚Ä¶\\" International broadcast *Australia ‚Äì Premiered on Eleven, June 28, 2011, in the Tuesday 9:30 timeslot, and currently repeated on The Comedy Channel in the Monday 9pm slot.

Hosted by former Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman,, along with keyboardist Tony Ashton, the show featured a mix of interviews with 1970s musicians and impromptu performances where the guest artist would join Wakeman and his house band in playing re-arranged versions of their classic songs or entirely new pieces, created for the show. The format was very informal with the setting likened to a bar, where Wakeman would interview the guest over a drink or two, followed by their performance, in front of a small studio audience, sitting in groups at tables. Wakeman would frequently cite the show as an opportunity for musicians from different bands to get the opportunity to work together. During its run, the show featured guests as diverse as Ian Paice, Steve Hackett, Andy Fairweather Low, John Entwistle, Godley and Creme, Eric Burdon and Phil Lynott.

The history of rail transport in Zambia began at the start of the twentieth century. Northern Rhodesia The British South Africa Company (BSAC) was responsible for building the Rhodesian railway system in the period of primary construction which ended in 1911, when the main line through Northern Rhodesia reached the Congo border and the Katanga copper mines. Railway construction in British South Africa Company- administered Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) was undertaken by Rhodesian Railways, established in 1899, as an extension of the system in Southern Rhodesia. Railway development was driven by Cecil Rhodes, whose original intention was for a railway extending across the Zambesi to Lake Tanganyika, popularly considered as part of a great Cape-Cairo railway linking all the British colonies of Africa. However, Rhodes was as much a capitalist in his motivation as a visionary, and when little gold was found in Mashonaland in Southern Rhodesia, he accepted that the scheme to reach Lake Tanganyika had no economic justification. Railways built by private companies without government subsidies need enough of the type of traffic that can pay high freight rates to recover their construction costs. The agricultural products that fueled much of Rhodesia's early economic growth could not provide this traffic; large quantities of minerals could. Most early railways in Africa were built by the British government rather than Chartered Companies. The need to raise capital and produce dividends prevented most Chartered Companies from undertaking such infrastructure investments. However, in the early period of railway construction, BSAC obtained finance from South African companies including Consolidated Gold Fields and De Beers in which Rhodes was a dominant force. BSAC also benefited from the personal fortunes of Rhodes before his death.J Lunn, (1992). The Political Economy of Primary Railway Construction in the Rhodesias, 1890-1911, pp. 239, 244.S Katzenellenbogen, (1974). Zambia and Rhodesia: Prisoners of the Past: A Note on the History of Railway Politics in Central Africa, pp. 63-4. The railway reached Bulawayo in 1897, and was extended to the Victoria Falls in 1902. Lines were built in the or Cape gauge. The railway arrived in the future Zambia early in 1905, when the long Livingstone‚ÄìKalomo line was built in advance of completion in September of that year of the Victoria Falls Bridge from the then Southern Rhodesia to Livingstone. The first wagons on the line were hauled by oxen, then a single locomotive was conveyed in pieces by cableway across the gorge where the bridge was being built to start up operations to Kalomo in advance of the main line connection.Horizon magazine: \\"Zambia's Second Industry\\", February 1965, pp4-11. The next section was to Broken Hill, (now Kabwe), which the railway reached in 1906. BSAC was assured that there would be much traffic from its lead and zinc mines, but this did not materialize because technical mining problems. The railway could not meet the costs of the construction loans, and the company faced major financial problems. The only area likely to generate sufficient mineral traffic to relieve these debts was Katanga. Another major bridge was required to cross the Kafue River and the long Kafue Railway Bridge, the longest on the Rhodesian Railways or Zambian Railways network, was completed in 1906. Initially, the Congo Free State had concluded that Katanga's copper deposits were not rich enough to justify the capital cost of building a railway to the coast, but expeditions between 1899 and 1901 proved their value. Copper deposits found in Northern Rhodesia before the First World War proved uneconomic to develop. In Zambia more lines were built. In the Copperbelt, a connection from Ndola to Chingola via Kitwe was opened approximately parallel to the line in the Belgian Congo. In 1923 to 1924, the Zambezi Sawmills Railway - later Mulobezi Railway - was built as a private railway for the extraction of teak from Mulobezi and Kataba to its north. It linked with several branch lines, and also operated passenger services as far as Kataba. A line from Choma to Masuku was also built in the southwest of the country and three short branch lines in the Copperbelt, leading to Chililabombwe, Mufulira and Luanshya. Until the mid-1960s, sleeper trains went from Ndola via Livingstone to Bulawayo in what was then Southern Rhodesia. In 1906 Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga was formed to exploit the Katanga mines. King Leopold favoured a railway route entirely in Congolese territory, linked to the Congo River. However, in 1908, BSAC agreed with Leopold to continue the Rhodesian railway to Elizabethville and the mines. Between 1912, when full- scale copper production began, until 1928 when a Congolese line was completed, almost all of Katanga's copper was shipped over the Rhodesian network to Beira. Even after the Congo route was opened, up to a third of Katanga's copper went to Beira, and the mine's supply of coal and coke mostly came from Wankie, the cheapest available source. This railway's revenue from Katanga enabled it to carry agricultural produce at low rates. Large-scale development of the Copperbelt only began in the late 1920s, with an increasing world market for copper. Transport was no problem as only short branches had to be built to connect the Copperbelt to the main line. In 1929, the Benguela Railway was completed, giving access to the Atlantic port of Benguela. The Benguela Railway provided the shortest, most direct route for copper from both Katanga and Northern Rhodesia, but it was never used to full capacity because both the Congo and the Rhodesias restricted its traffic in favour of their own lines.S Katzenellenbogen, (1974). Zambia and Rhodesia: Prisoners of the Past: A Note on the History of Railway Politics in Central Africa, pp. 65-6. When the BSAC administration of the Rhodesias was terminated, an agreement between the Colonial Secretary and the company of 29 September 1923 recognised that BSAC was entitled to protection because of the size of its railway investment in Northern and Southern Rhodesia. The agreement required the governors of each territory to refer any Bill authorizing the construction of new railways or altering the rates that the existing railways charged to the Colonial Secretary. This prevented the legislatures of Northern or Southern Rhodesia from introducing competition or exerting pressure on the BSAC-controlled railways to reduce rates without British government sanction.G. D. Clough, (1924). The Constitutional Changes in Northern Rhodesia and Matters Incidental to the Transition, p. 282. European settlers in Northern Rhodesia had two main criticisms of British South Africa Company railway policy. Firstly, that its financial arrangements unfairly benefited the company and its shareholders, and secondly, that the settlers paid for these benefits through exorbitant railway rates. Although the allegations were probably ill-founded, from 1914 onwards, the European settlers called for the replacement of BSAC control of the railways through nationalisation. In 1923 responsible government was achieved, but rather outright nationalisation, the settler government opted for a form of public control under the Railway Act of 1926. This left BSAC as owner of the railways, which were called Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways until 1927, and Rhodesia Railways Limited after. This remained the situation until 1947, when the Rhodesian Government acquired the assets of Rhodesia Railways Limited.J Lunn, (1992).

Sharp, Stewart and Company built Zambezi Sawmills Railway Class 8A No 1126, at the Railway Museum (Zambia), 31 May 1990. Zambia In 1964, Northern Rhodesia became independent under the name Zambia. The railway company was divided, and the part belonging to Zambia was renamed Zambia Railways. Traffic between Zambia and Southern Rhodesia - which renamed itself as Rhodesia in November 1965 - was suspended until the foundation of the state of Zimbabwe in April 1980. TAZARA Railway New Kapiri Mposhi railway station, TAZARA Railway, 2009. From 1964, discussions took place about a proposed railway line between Tanzania and Zambia. As Great Britain had not shown any interest in the proposal, the People's Republic of China joined in. The PRC government sponsored construction of the railway specifically to eliminate Zambia's economic dependence on Rhodesia and South Africa.Thomas W. Robinson and David L. Shambaugh. Chinese Foreign Policy: theory and practice, 1994. Page 287. The contractual foundations were closed in 1967, and one year later, the Tanzania- Zambia Railway (TAZARA) was established, as a condominial railway:de:Kondominalbahn owned by Tanzania and Zambia. The TAZARA was built in the or Cape gauge, which was common in southern Africa, but new to Tanzania. The line was handed over to the company as it was completed in sections in 1973 and 1974. The TAZARA has been a major economic conduit in the region. However, it has never been profitable and more recently it has suffered from competition from road transport (such as the Trans‚ÄìCaprivi Highway and Walvis Bay Corridor to Namibia) and the re-orientation of Zambia's economic links towards South Africa after the end of apartheid.Seat 61 website accessed 20 February 2007 As of October 2008, a Tanzanian newspaper described the TAZARA's condition as being \\"on the verge of collapse due to financial crisis\\", with the operator being three months late on paying worker's wages and most of its 12 locomotives being out of service.\\"Save the 'Uhuru Railway' from collapse\\" \\"This Day\\", Wednesday, October 29, 2008.

Biography He was born in Arendal, the son of Christian Fredrik Iuell (1858‚Äì1922) and Mathilde Fredrikke Augusta Hoyer (1864-1937). His brothers were prison director Niels Iuell and judge Torolf Juell. He attended Kristiania Commerce School (Oslo handelsgymnasium) from 1910 to 1912. He graduated from the Sorbonne in 1916. He studied at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes Commerciales and at the Facult√© de Droit in Paris from 1916 to 1918. He became a certified translator in French and English. From 1914 to 1916, Juell was a secretary at the Norwegian Consulate in Algiers before studying in France. In 1922, he was hired in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and worked there the rest of the interwar period, except for the years 1929 to 1932 when he worked for French mining companies in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia. In 1932 he returned to the foreign service and became secretary of the Norwegian delegation which negotiated trade treaty with the United Kingdom. In 1938 he became legation secretary in London, and in 1941 he became consul in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Education and career Fisken, the son of a farmer, was born on Gelleyburn farm, near Crieff, Perthshire. After attending school at the neighbouring village of Muthill, he was sent to St. Andrews College to study for the ministry under Professor Duncan. Subsequently he removed to the University of Glasgow, and thence to the Divinity Hall of the United Secession Church. While there he taught a school at Alyth, near his birthplace. Upon receiving license in the presbytery of Dundee, he commenced his career as a preacher in the Secession church. He visited various places throughout the country, including the Orkney Islands. He was sent to the presbytery at Newcastle upon Tyne, and preached as a probationer at the adjoining village of Stamfordham, where in 1847 he was ordained into the priesthood. In the double capacity of governor and secretary he did much towards promoting the success of the scheme of the endowed schools at Stamfordham. Inventions William Fisken, along with his brothers, Thomas and David, had a keen interest in mechanics, and in 1855 were granted a patent for an innovative new steam plough. The brothers were subsequently involved in a lawsuit with John Fowler, who was widely credited with the invention. The jury found that the Fiskens were the original discoverers.Beadel et al. v. Howard et al., Newton's London Journal of Arts and Sciences, Volume 17. Newton and Son, 1863. Fisken also invented a potato-sowing machine, a safety steam boiler, a propeller, an apparatus for heating churches, which worked excellently, and the 'steam tackle' which, patented in July 1855, helped to render the steam plough of practical use. This system of haulage, which obtained second prize at the royal show at Wolverhampton, has undergone great modifications since its early appearance in Scotland in 1852, its exhibition at Carlisle in 1855, and at the show of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1863. Fisken also worked on the fly-rope system; an endless rope set into motion by the flywheel of the engine drove windlasses by which the plough or other implement was put in motion. A great deal of excellent work was done on this system, especially with tackle made by Messrs. Barford & Perkins of Peterborough, but for some reason the system never took with farmers, and very few sets of Fisken's tackle are now in use.Engineer, 11 January 1884, p. 37. Fisken was the author of a pamphlet on 'The Cheapest System of Steam Cultivation and Steam Cartage,' and of another 'On the Comparative Methods of Steam Tackle,' which gained the prize of the Royal Bath and West of England Society. Death He died at his manse in Stamfordham, on 28 December 1883, aged upwards of seventy.

He was a leading African-American preacher and activist for equality before the American Civil War,Brown, William Wells. \\"J. Sella Martin\\", The Black Man: His Antecedents, His Genius, and his achievements, Boston: J. Redpath, 1863, pp. 241-245, edition online at Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina traveling to England to lecture against slavery. When he returned, he preached in Presbyterian churches in Washington, DC. After the American Civil War, Martin returned to the South, working during the Reconstruction era in education in Alabama and Mississippi. He became a politician in Louisiana and in 1872 was elected to the state legislature from Caddo Parish. In that year, the gubernatorial election was fiercely disputed, and the state legislature was ultimately taken over by the Democrats, en route to regaining control of the state government. Martin had an appointed position with the US Post Office and also wrote for the Louisianian newspaper. Early years John Sella Martin was born into slavery in 1832 in Charlotte, North Carolina. His mother was a slave, and his father was her white master. Under the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, adopted by Virginia in 1662 and later other colonies in slave law, children of slave mothers took her status and were born into slavery, regardless of who their father was and what proportion of European ancestry they had. this gave rise to many mixed-race slaves, some of majority-white ancestry. At the age of six Martin, his mother and his only sister were taken to Columbus, Georgia where they were sold. His mother and sister were purchased by one man and John Sella Martin was purchased by a free black man named Horace King.Freedom and Slavery in the United States of America, 162 His new owner was an old bachelor. Martin served him in the capacity of a valet de chambre until the age of eighteen. They resided together in one of the principal hotels in Columbus, and Martin was given the opportunity to learn how to read and write, as well as be exposed to a more worldly view (as opposed to being an agricultural worker). He met travelers from throughout the United States and Canada staying at the hotel, as well as their servants. =False freedom= When Martin was sixteen his owner went blind, and Martin was entrusted with helping him carry out his personal affairs; he gave the youth a home-school type education. When his master died, Martin (then eighteen), was set free by his will. But his master's relatives successfully contested the will, forcing Martin to remain in bondage. They had him sold during settlement of the estate, and he was taken to Mobile, Alabama. Escape to new life After escaping slavery in Alabama in 1856 at the age of 24, Martin made his way to the North, first reaching Canada. He finally settled in Boston, Massachusetts, considered a center of freedom for blacks. It had a strong, biracial abolitionist movement. He entered the ministry and became minister of the First Independent Baptist Church (1860-1862) in the Beacon Hill section of that city.Philip Sheldon Foner, Robert J. Branham: Lift Every Voice: African American Oratory, 1787-1900 p.452; University Alabama Press; (1997) He was active in the abolitionist movement and worked to achieve equality of the races. Martin was well received by abolitionist leaders and admired for his speaking skills. He was selected to represent the American Missionary Association in England, where he lectured widely in London against slavery and helped raise funds for education of African Americans. On his return, he joined the Presbyterian Church and was a popular preacher in Washington, DC. After the American Civil War, Martin returned to the South, working in education in Alabama and Mississippi. He went into politics in Louisiana. In 1872 he was elected to the state legislature as a fusion candidate from Caddo Parish, Louisiana. In that year, the gubernatorial election was so fiercely disputed that the federal government had to get involved, deciding in favor of the Republican candidate. But, the state legislature had several seats that were contested; Democrats ultimately took control and Martin lost his seat. Martin was appointed as an agent of the US Post Office, and also wrote for the Louisianian newspaper. Martin's death Martin died in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1876 by an overdose of laudanum, which he was known to use for \\"his nerves\\". He left no suicide note, so it was not known if the overdose was accidental or intentional. He had developed a drinking problem in his later years, and was reported to be unemployed and despondent at the time of his death. He left behind a wife and a daughter. He had a national reputation and his death was covered sympathetically by The New York Times. They concluded their obituary saying: > Because, reared as a slave he made a man of himself, and for the good work > he had done in the church when he was at his best, for the long years when > he had eloquently and earnestly labored for the advancement of his race, he > is kindly remembered by the colored people of the United States. If he > faltered on the good road before his work was completed, others have also > given up in weakness to an enemy that slays thousands.

The track \\"Squeezebox Days\\" featured on the soundtrack to the 1997 film All Over Me. The track \\"Sleepless Commotion\\" was written by Heather, about the murder of her mother, who was killed by her husband. Release and reception The album was poorly promoted by the band's label, MCA Records, who were going through staff changes at the time. In a review for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave Pristine Smut a star rating of four out of five. He noted that the album had a rhythm section added to the \\"folk pop\\" of its predecessor, 1994's Murmurs. He praised producers Klein and Lang for steering the band towards \\"adult alternative rock\\" but said that the sound was \\"clean and pristine ... shined and polished and now ready for radio\\". He said, however, that the songs on Pristine Smut were stronger than those of the previous album. Robert Christgau gave the album an A- rating and praised it as an improvement on their previous album. He said of Pristine Smut, \\"not since Liz Phair's \\"Flower\\", Janet's \\"Throb\\", and Madonna's Erotica has pop softcore attended so sweetly to the erogenous zones.\\" In a review for The Advocate, Barry Walters also noted the \\"rockin' rhythm section\\" of the second album.

Later the incidence became in the name of Koothuparambu town. Kerala, India. The incident happened at Tellicherry Road in Kannur. (the district of Kerala). The firing happened after the inauguration of the Co- operative Urban Bank‚Äôs evening branch. It happened when the DYFI [Democratic Youth Federation of India] had organised a protest against the educational policy ‚Äì of granting government quota seats to the management ‚Äì of the then United Democratic Front government led by the Congress. Police resorted to firing when the protesters blocked minister MV Raghavan, who was in town to inaugurate an event However, the inauguration was ensued in chaos and agitation, which the DYFI termed as \\"a protest against M.V. Raghavan, Communist Marxist Party (CMP) leader and Kerala‚Äôs Minister, for starting the medical college as a self-financing institution at Pariyaram, Kannur\\", and \\"Granting government quota seats to the management.\\", The police fired at the crowd for both the protection of the Minister and public and private property. Five DYFI activists were dead and six people were injured. Those who were facing criminal proceedings included the then sub-divisional magistrate Antony, DySP Abdul Hakkim Bathery, and constables P K Lukose, Sivadasan and Balachandran. They were charged with murder, attempted murder and conspiracy by a magistrate court based on a private complaint.  Cause and the Incident The political party called C.P.I.(M)‚Äì The Communist Party of India (Marxist) was dominant in the Kannur District of the State of Kerala. One of its leaders called M.V. Raghavan, broke away from the party after 15 years and formed a new political party called ‚Äì CMP (The Communist Marxist Party). The CMP soon became a constituent of the United Democratic Front, which formed the Government that came in power in the State of Kerala. Raghavan became a minister in the UDF Government, in charge of Co-operation and Ports. The Youth Wing of the C.P.I.(M) became greatly offended by this and took matters into their own hands by ensuring Raghavan was prevented from entering the Kannur District. In January 1993, Raghavan made a visit to Kannur District and the members of CPI(M) made a few country-made bombs and hurled at him. Following that incident, the Government arranged for extra security measures to be taken during Raghavan‚Äôs visits to Kannur District. Contrary to the advice given by the district administration, on 25 November 1994, Raghavan made plans to visit and attend the inauguration of the ‚Äòevening branch of the Co-operative Urban Bank‚Äô, located in the Alakkandy Complex at Kuthuparamba ‚Äì Tellicherry Road, Kannur District. The first firing occurred in the proximity of the town hall, on the orders of the Executive Magistrate and the Deputy Superintendent of Police. The second firing occurred in vicinity of Kuthuparamba‚Äôs police station on the orders of the Superintendent of Police. Five people were killed and six injured, followed by more than a hundred, also injured (including a few police personnel) by the use of a lathi (a heavy bamboo stick often used as a weapon by the police in South Asia). Pushpan of Chokli in Kannur survived the firing. But for the past 24 years he hasn‚Äôt been able to move from his bed by his own. A bullet hit his spinal cord during the firing, which has rendered him paralysed and bedridden since then. In June 2012, the Kerala High Court quashed the murder charges framed against deputy collector TT Antony, IPS officer Ravada Chandrasekhar and four other police officials in connection with the firing. The court quashed the case on the grounds that necessary government sanction for prosecuting public officials was not obtained in the case. Victims The Koothuparamba firing resulted in the immediate death of five activists from the DYFI. Six more activists were injured at the hands of the police. These five youth were K.K. Rajeevan, Madhu, Shibulal, Babu and Roshan. After the death of the youth, a larger scale firing took place. Leaving hundreds of people injured. The court proceeded to hear the case. The shooting was argued to be unprovoked by the Solicitor General. Since the protesters did not pose a threat to the life of the Minister, it was argued that the shooting was unnecessary. Many articles consider these students martyrs for sacrificing their lives. The cause that the victims are fighting for is a concern that is spread all over India. In a study by L J Perry, it is found that India has the highest involvement of strikes and shortages. Take note, L. J. Perry studies the difference between four countries including India, Indonesia, United States and Australia. Case Proceedings There were two firings that took place on 25 November 1994. The first firing took place in the vicinity of the town hall, where Minister M.V. Raghavan (Minister of Co-operatives and Ports) was inaugurating the Co-operative Urban Bank. The second firing took place in the vicinity of the Koothuparamba Police Station. . T.T Anthony (Deputy Collector and Executive Magistrate), M.V. Raghavan, and A.H Bathery (Deputy Superintendent of Police) were accused for the initiation of the firing and the death of five DYFI members. Two FIRs were lodged on the day of the incident, and an Inquiry Commission report was sent to the Government. On 30 June 1997, the report was accepted by the government and directions for taking legal actions against the accused were given. On 2 July 1997 the Director General of police, sent instructions to Inspector General of Police (North Zone) to file a case and have it investigated by a senior officer. The Inspector General of Police said that \\"firing without justifications by which people were killed amounted to murder.\\" He later told the Station House Officer to register file a case and send a copy of the FIR to the Deputy Superintendent of Police. An interim report was filed by the DIG of Police on 29 September 1998 in the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate. Three Writ Petitions were filed by, T.T Anthony, ASP R.A Chandrashekhar, and Police Constable Damodaran who fired the shot at the incident. The Single Judge of High Court decided to discard the Writs and ordered for further C.B.I investigation. At this stage, six other Writ petitions were filed, three by the three accused and the other three by the state of Kerala. The Division Bench of the High Court ordered that the ASP should be relieved of the charged and the FIR be quashed. At the same time the Division Bench ordered a further investigation by the Kerala State Police to be conducted instead of C.B.I. The senior counsel of the Executive Magistrate pleaded that the actions of Mr. T.T Anthony did not constitute offense as that action was a part of his duty. He supported his pleading by quoting the Inquiry Commission Report, which stated that the DYFI were behaving in an unruly and uncivilized manner. The solicitor brought in the Legislative provisions that supported that the Executive Magistrate had the powers and reiterated that it would be illegal to treat a rightfully made executive order as an offense. The solicitor general pointed out to the fact that the Divisional Bench order to get the matter investigated by the police was not challenged by all accused and therefore the accused party cannot challenge the findings of the investigation report. This being a cognizable offense should have gone before the court. According to the Solicitor General, the F.I.R still stays because an offense was indeed done which resulted in the death of five persons. Since the place where the DYFI members were killed was far from where the Minister was, the DYFI members could not have posed a threat to the Minister‚Äôs life. The Solicitor General referred to the conclusion of previous proceedings, in which the ASP was already released as per the order of the Divisional Bench and could not be counted among the accused. It is argued that the Inquiry Commission report has no evidential value and it is only of recommendation value. According to the Solicitor General, the High Court Judge erred in determining that the ASP be exonerated based on the commission report.  Conclusion The court will not interfere with the decision that the ASP is to be exonerated. However, to throw more light on the facts surrounding the matter, further investigation could still be pursued by the agencies with the leave of the court. The reasons given for the decision by the Bench are based on the constitutional provisions that allow the Commissioner of Police to follow the law of the land. The interpretation of this being that the executive magistrate's order was as per the law of land, and all the police staff was duty bound to follow it.

He was the 2nd Attorney General of Wisconsin and served as a Union Army officer in the American Civil War. Early life and career Coon was born on March 28, 1820, in Covington, New York. He was educated at Alexander Academy and Norwich University and then studied law in New York. In 1843, Coon moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin Territory, where he set up a legal practice. He rose in prominence in the new state and, in 1849, he was elected the 2nd Attorney General of Wisconsin running on the Democratic ticket alongside incumbent Governor Nelson Dewey. After one term in office however, Coon announced that he would not be a candidate for renomination at the 1851 Democratic state convention. Coon continued to work as a lawyer in Milwaukee, but was one of several early Wisconsin politicians caught up in scandals related to misappropriations of state funds. For Coon, he was granted about $667 (about $19,000 adjusted for inflation to 2019) for collection of funds associated with canal mortgages. Nevertheless, Coon remained a leading member of the Democratic Party in Milwaukee and was an outspoken supporter of Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 United States presidential election. He also undertook a years long unsuccessful crusade in the legislature and courts to secure relief for farmers who had mortgaged their land to aid in building railroads in the state. Civil War service At the outbreak of the American Civil War, despite his politics, Coon was commissioned colonel of the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry Regiment by Governor Alexander Randall. The regiment was organized in May 1861 at Camp Randall, in Madison, Wisconsin, and mustered into service June 11. Colonel Coon led the regiment to Washington where they camped briefly on Meridian Hill. However, shortly after their arrival, Colonel Coon was removed from command and given an assignment by the War Department to oversee the mustering of additional Wisconsin regiments. Aside from the official explanation, there were other theories as to his dismissal, ranging from rumors about his alcoholism to allegations of Republicans in the War Department attempting to oust prominent Democrats from command positions. Nevertheless, when the Army marched toward battle on July 16, Colonel Coon requested to accompany them as a volunteer advisor to Colonel William Tecumseh Sherman, who commanded the brigade to which the 2nd Wisconsin was attached. Accounts of the First Battle of Bull Run, including remarks attributed to Colonel Sherman, describe that Colonel Coon briefly attempted to rally the regiment during the disorganized retreat from the Bull Run field, and may have managed to cover some of the retreat. Colonel Coon formally resigned from command of the 2nd Wisconsin on July 30, 1861, along with Lt. Colonel Peck, who had commanded the regiment on the Manassas campaign. Although he was officially planning to raise a company of cavalry to join the new brigade being mustered under General Rufus King, he ultimately did not return to military service. Later years Coon resumed his law practice in Milwaukee, and, in 1862, was elected district attorney for Milwaukee County. Though he sought renomination for another term as district attorney, the Milwaukee county democrats instead nominated Jedd P. C. Cottrill. Coon's legal career declined amidst worsening alcoholism. He was sustained through his later years by the charity of friends and former colleagues. He died of Tuberculosis on October 12, 1883, at Passavant hospital in Milwaukee. Personal life and family Coon married Sarah Vincent and had at least three children, though their two daughters died as infants. At the time of his death, he was estranged from his family, with his wife having returned to New York and his son living in Chicago.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Furness, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of four other local parishes. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1874 to a design by the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin. Holy Trinity was built on the site of an earlier church. For 67 years the curate of that church had been Robert Walker, who was made famous by the poet William Wordsworth. Wordsworth called him \\"Wonderful Walker\\", and made reference to him in his Duddon Sonnets and in the poem The Excursion. It was paid for mainly by the industrialist H. W. Schneider. Architecture =Exterior= Holy Trinity is constructed in coursed slate rubble and has a slate roof. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel in one range, with an organ loft and vestry to the north, and a south porch. At the west end is a gabled bellcote. All the windows are lancets. There are wide buttresses externally between the nave and the chancel. A stone is attached to the porch incorporating a sundial; this had formerly been the shearing stool of Walker. =Interior= Inside the church is a stoup with a trefoil arcade. Painted on the wall of the chancel are the Ten Commandments. Also in the church is a brass. This had formerly been on a gravestone; it is to the memory of Walker, who died in 1802, and his wife, Anne, who had died two years previously. The stained glass, dating from 1897, is by Kempe. The two-manual organ was built in 1902 by Young.

Katouzian is an associate professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, specializing in Biomechanics at Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran. Katouzian is married and has two sons. Political career As a pro-democracy advocate, Katouzian has continually defended freedom of speech and press. He was one of the major opponents and critics of president Ahmadinejad's policies and behaviors. He was the first politician who after the 2009 election publicly stated that Ahmadinejad does not have the competence, character, and quality to be the president of Iran and must be evicted and dismissed. He supported Mir-Hossein Mousavi. Katouzian's emphasis and views on accountability, transparency, and human rights as major components of a good governance, was not tolerable for high rank authorities in Iran. He was elected as a member of the parliament in the 2004 election from his home town Tehran as a conservative candidate after receiving 502,872 votes. He was later reelected in 2008 but did not seek re-election in 2012.

It was the last depot commissioned by railroad magnate James J. Hill. The depot served passengers until the late 1950s and continued as a freight depot until the mid-1980s, when it was closed, boarded up, and abandoned. In 1988 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Great Northern Depot for its local significance in the themes of exploration/settlement and transportation. It was nominated for being Bemidji's only intact early-20th-century railroad building, symbolizing the rail access that transformed the settlement into a logging boomtown and regional trade center. With Empty and deteriorating, the building was slated for demolition in the late 20th century. It was saved by a nearly $2 million adaptive reuse effort and now houses the Beltrami County History Center, operated by the Beltrami County Historical Society. Description The building is a one-story structure of brick and limestone, with a hip roof. The architecture is generally neoclassical, as evoked by the arched windows, doors, and fa√ßade, but it also has influences of the Arts and Crafts style, as shown by the wide eaves and the design of the windows. The interior, measuring , contained separate waiting areas for men and women. Each waiting room had settees, and the ladies' room had several rocking chairs. The center of the building housed the ticket office, and the east end had baggage rooms and a freight room. A small, windowed projection on the south side allowed views of the tracks from both directions. All wires entered the new structure from the rear, so as not to distract from the aesthetics of the building. Origin Bemidji's first Great Northern Depot was a wooden structure built in 1898 and enlarged in 1901. In 1903, electricity was added, and in 1905, a baggage room, but the old depot was still insufficient. By 1907, the Bemidji Commercial Club had started a push for a new station. The old depot was too small, not well ventilated, and couldn't handle the traffic that was coming through Bemidji. In June 1911, pleas went out to the Great Northern Railway to build a new depot. Governor Adolph Olson Eberhart and Louis W. Hill, president of the railway and son of James J. Hill, visited Bemidji. The Bemidji Commercial Club treated them to dinner at the Markham Hotel and took them by boat around Lake Bemidji. Afterward, local businessmen rode with Louis Hill in his private coach on the train for further discussion. In January 1912, James J. Hill, chairman of the board of the Great Northern Railway, came to Bemidji. He spoke at the Armory on Bemidji Avenue; the Commercial Club entertained him at the Markham Hotel and escorted him around the city. On April 25, 1912, a headline in the Bemidji Daily Pioneer announced: \\"Hill Promises a New Brick Building\\". Work was to start immediately. Plans that had been drawn up the previous year were re-examined because they called for an expensive \\"Permanent Type A depot, usually built for towns of 20,000 or more.\\" But when Hill visited Bemidji, the first thing he noticed when he stepped off the train was an impressive new brick Minnesota and International Railway depot just down the tracks to the east. \\"We will build a depot and a good one,\\" he said. The original plans were approved for a , building with a red brick and sandstone exterior. Most of the work on the depot was completed before the end of 1912. Thousands of people toured the depot for its grand opening on January 16, 1913. Hill returned to Bemidji by train for the grand opening and spoke at a banquet at the Markham Hotel that evening. He told the crowd he'd taken special care to see to the depot's completion since it would be his last. Beltrami County History Center The depot served passengers until the late 1950s and continued as a freight depot until the mid-1980s, when it was closed, boarded up, and abandoned. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, but without a tenant, the building was damaged by water seepage and vandals and dirtied by pigeons, bats, and rodents. The depot had become a liability to the railroad company, by then the Burlington Northern Railroad. Orders were sent to demolish the building. Thanks to railroad superintendent Roger Mackenroth who put the demolition orders on hold, the hard work and fundraising of a devoted Historical Society Museum Committee, and a state capital bonding bill for $650,000, the building was saved and renovated at a cost of nearly two million dollars. It reopened as the home of the Beltrami County Historical Society in October 2000. The rail line is still in active use by the BNSF Railway.

Biography Coin of Shapur II. In the Middle Persian Bundahishn, Adurbad's lineage is traced back to the legendary Dursarw, a son of the Pishdadian king Manuchehr. In al-Biruni's The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries, he is also mentioned as the descendant of Dursarw. According to the Denkard, Adurbad was from the \\"village Kuran\\", which may be a corruption of \\"a village of Makran\\", a province in southeastern Iran. The place may also refer to a place in Pars. According to Zoroastrian traditions, a proof of the validity of his line of religious traditions was that he underwent the ordeal of molten bronze. That is metal was poured on his chest and he emerged as unscathed. According to Iranica, \\"In keeping with his religious zeal, ƒÄdurbƒÅd was a force in the enactment and implementing of decrees against non-Zoroastrians; the established church is described as having then fallen on evil days, plagued by doubt and infidelity.\\". Various andarz texts (collection of wise counsels) are attributed to him. The Denkard ascribes admonitions to Adurbad; and an Arabic version of these admonitions occur in the work of Miskawayh's . Two groups of his counsels occur in extant Middle Persian text. The first group of counsels contain his addresses to his and is in part translated by Miskawayh in Arabic. The second group comprises his supposed deathbed utterances. A collection of questions addressed to him by a disciple and his responses are found in the Pahlavi Rivayat. A translation of some of the Middle Persian counsels exist in the book: R. C. Zaehner, The Teachings of the Magi, London, 1956. Some Counsels *Do not tell a lie to anyone. *Do not take an oath on either what is true or what is false. *Do not consciously wager on anything at all. *Do not seduce other men's wives, for that is a grievous sin for thy soul. *My son, think upon virtue and do not turn your thoughts to sin, for man does not live eternally and the things of the spirit are the more greatly to be desired. *Be single- minded among rulers and friends. *Do not be violent or ill-considered in your speech, for the man who is violent or ill-considered in his speech is like a fire that falls upon a forest and burns up all birds and fish and creeping things. *If you would not be abused by others, do not abuse anyone *Renew your friendship with old friends, for an old friend is like old wine which becomes better and more fit for the consumption of princes the older it is. *Keep your hands from stealing, your feet from treading the path of undutifulness, and your mind from unlawful desires (varan), for whoso practices virtue obtains his reward, and whoso commits sin receives his *Whoso digs a pit for his enemies will fall into it himself. *Do not deliver yourself up as a slave to any man. *Do not mock at anyone. *Listen to all that you hear and do not repeat it at random. *Hold a wise man whose position is exalted in high esteem, ask his opinion and listen to it. *Cherish a wise and modest woman and ask her in marriage. *Be of good repute so that you may live at ease. *Do not destroy your own soul for the sake of anger or vengeance *Honour your father and mother, listen to them and obey them, for so long as a man's father and mother live, he is like a lion in the jungle which has no fear of anyone at all; but he who has neither father nor mother is like a widowed woman who is despoiled by men and can do nothing about it and whom all men despise. *Do good and keep your doors open to any who may come from far or near, for he who does not do good and does not keep his doors open, will find the door of Heaven and of Paradise closed. *Do not be unduly glad when good fortune attends you, and do not be unduly downcast when misfortune befalls you.

The town hosts the headquarters of British companies and the UK offices of foreign multinationals, as well as being a major retail centre. Whilst located close enough to London to be sometimes regarded as part of the London commuter belt, Reading is a net inward destination for commuters. During the morning peak period, there are some 30,000 inward arrivals in the town, compared to 24,000 departures. Industry The Oracle Corporation campus in Thames Valley Business Park Reading has a significant historical involvement in the information technology industry, largely as a result of the early presence in the town of sites of International Computers Limited and Digital. Whilst both these companies have been swallowed by other groups, their respective descendants in Fujitsu and Hewlett-Packard both still have local operations. More recently Microsoft and Oracle have established multi-building campuses in the town. Procter & Gamble also has an innovation centre in the town, which is active in the production of Gillette razors, and is the second largest in the world of its kind. Other technology companies with a significant presence in the town include Huawei Technologies, Access IS, Agilent Technologies, Audio & Design (Recording) Ltd, Bang & Olufsen, Cisco, Ericsson, Harris Corporation, Intel, Nvidia, Sage, Sagem Orga, SGI, Symantec, Symbol Technologies, Verizon Business, Virgin Media, Websense, Xansa (now Steria), and Xerox. Yell HQ The financial company ING Direct had its headquarters in Reading, as does the directories company Yell Group and the natural gas major BG Group. The insurance company Prudential has an administration centre in the town, whilst PepsiCo and Holiday Inn have offices. Like most major cities, Reading has offices of the Big Four accounting firms Deloitte, PwC, Ernst & Young and KPMG. These companies are distributed around Reading, including in business parks just inside or outside the borough boundary. Prudential and Yell, together with most of the accountancy companies, have their offices in central Reading. Thames Valley Business Park is home to the Microsoft and Oracle campuses, as well as BG Group and ING Direct. Green Park Business Park is home to Huawei Technologies, Symantec, Logica and Cisco, whilst the nearby Reading International Business Park is home to Verizon Business. Winnersh Triangle Business Park is home to technology companies, whilst Arlington Business Park is home to KPMG, Nvidia and PepsiCo. Examples of long-standing industrial companies originating in Reading include Kee Klamp. Retail The Oracle Reading town centre is a major shopping centre. The primary catchment area for the town centre (the area for which the centre attracts the largest single flow of generated expenditure) for non-bulky comparison goods extends as far as Goring-on-Thames, Henley-on-Thames, Pangbourne and Wokingham. The secondary catchment area (the area where the centre attracts 10% or more of generated expenditure) also includes Ascot, Bracknell, Sandhurst, Camberley, Didcot, Farnborough, Fleet, High Wycombe, Maidenhead, Newbury, Slough, Tadley, Thatcham, Wallingford and Windsor. In 2007 an independent poll placed Reading as one of the top ten retail destinations in the UK. The principal town centre shopping area is around Broad Street, which was pedestrianised in 1995. Broad Street is anchored at its east and west ends respectively by The Oracle and Broad Street Mall enclosed shopping centres. In 2007 14.4 million people visited the covered part of the Oracle shopping centre. Broad Street looking east There are three major department stores in Reading: John Lewis & Partners (formerly known as Heelas), Debenhams and House of Fraser. There are also branches of chain stores, including Virgin Media, Boots, fcuk, H&M;, Marks and Spencers, Thorntons, Next, Primark and W H Smith. The booksellers Waterstone's have two branches in Reading.http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/displayFindBranch.do Besides the two major shopping malls, Reading has three smaller shopping arcades, the Bristol and West Arcade, Harris Arcade and The Walk, which contain smaller specialist stores. An older form of retail facility is represented by Union Street, popularly known as Smelly Alley, due to the former presence of many open-fronted fishmongers and butchers. The occupancy has shifted towards major retail chains, although a few of independent shops, including a fishmonger and butcher remain. Unlike many cities, Reading has no indoor market, but there is a street market at Hosier Street in the town centre, open from Wednesday to Saturday, with 60 stalls selling a mixture of food, flowers and plants, cultural goods, and household goods. A farmers' market operates on two Saturdays a month at the cattle market.

Biography In Babylonia, he lived in a place called Sikara on the shore of the Tigris river, near Mahuza,Babylonian Talmud, Hullin 94b and had served as the city sage instituting measures. He mainly studied under Rav and frequently quotes his teachings.Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 7a; Yebamot 92b; Ketuvot 50b, and more. He would sometimes go to Samuel's school and submit secondhand reports of Rav, and get Samuel's response.Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 53a; Hullin 45b; In both cases, Samuel responded harshly, \\"If he said so - then we do not know anything about the laws of Shabbat Trefah\\", an expression that is unmatched in the Talmud, and he may have thought that R. Hiyya misunderstood the second hand reports ('◊ô◊ë◊ï◊ê ◊î◊ú◊ï◊ô', Hullin, p. 187) He was also a student of Samuel (probably after the death of Rav, like some other of Rav's students), and addressed him with questions,Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 58a and would sometimes dispute him.Babylonian Talmud, Eruvin 95a; Jerusalem Talmud, Ma'aser Sheni 1:3. In the Babylonian Talmud (Beitzah 32b) it is said: \\"R. Hiyya bar Joseph recited in the presence of Rav Nachman\\", which is inconsistent with the order of time. hence, in \\"Halakhot Gedolot\\" (\\"Halakhot Yom-Tov\\") and in Asher ben Jehiel (on Beitzah 4:8) the version is: \\"in the presence of R. Yochanan\\". Later on he made Aliyah to the Land of Israel. Here he made his livelihood from salt trading.Babylonian Talmud, Bava Metzia 48b; according to an equivalent story in the Jerusalem Talmud, Bava Metzia 4:2, Hiyya bar Joseph was the buyer not the seller. Little is known about his family, except that after immigrating to the Land of Israel alone, he sent someone to bring his wife.Jerusalem Talmud, Sotah 1:3; Commentators of the Jerusalem Talmud interpreted, in that context, that he was a Kohen and his wife fell in captivity, though Aaron Hyman in Toldot Tan·∫öim ·πøe- æAmor·∫öim opines that this is not true and interpreted the context of the story differently. Upon arrival to the Land of Israel he studied with R. Yochanan bar Nafcha and Shimon ben Lakish,Babylonian Talmud, Hullin 54a; Temurah 7a and submitted to them rulings by Rav.Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 39a Even with Yochanan bar Nafcha he disputed on various matters.Babylonian Talmud, Zevachim 20b; Menachot 90a; Jerusalem Talmud, Bava Metzia 4:2 He also studied under R. Hiyya bar Abba.Jerusalem Talmud, Kil'ayim 4:4 The Talmud also mentions that Hiyya bar Joseph is addressing Yochanan bar Nafcha with questions, however, he was probably not considered Yochanan's pupil: in a dispute among them, Hiyya bar Joseph is mentioned first, and various doubts on halachic matters were brought before both of them as one.Jerusalem Talmud, Bava Metzia 4:2, Bava Batra 9:6 At times, Hiyya bar Joseph also delivers statements in the name of Hoshaiah Rabbah.Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 16b; Avodah Zarah 51b Pupils Rav Giddel studied under him when he was still in Babylonia, and delivers statements in his name that are secondhand statements made by Rav.Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat, 7a; Yebamot, 92b; Avodah Zarah, 50a The rabbis of Caesarea, the students of Caesarean academy, also cite laws in his name.Jerusalem Talmud, Yoma 1:1 References Category:Talmud rabbis of Babylonia Category:Talmud rabbis of the Land of Israel ","title":"Hiyya bar Joseph"},{"id":"32050230","text":"Pia Ranslet (born 3 July 1956, Allinge, Bornholm, Denmark) is a Danish painter and sculptor.

It transforms manufacturing resources and manufacturing capabilities into manufacturing services, which can be managed and operated in an intelligent and unified way to enable the full sharing and circulating of manufacturing resources and manufacturing capabilities. CMfg can provide safe and reliable, high quality, cheap and on-demand manufacturing services for the whole lifecycle of manufacturing. The concept of manufacturing here refers to big manufacturing that includes the whole lifecycle of a product (e.g. design, simulation, production, test, maintenance). The concept of Cloud manufacturing was initially proposed by the research group led by Prof. Bo Hu Li and Prof. Lin Zhang in China in 2009. Lin Zhang, Yongliang Luo, Wenhui Fan, Fei Tao, Lei Ren, Analyses of cloud manufacturing and related advanced manufacturing models, Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 2011, 17(3):458-468. Related discussions and research were conducted hereafter, and some similar definitions (e.g. Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing (CBDM). Wu, D., Thames, J.L., Rosen, D.W., & Schaefer, D. (2012). Towards a Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing Paradigm: Looking Backward, Looking Forward. Proceedings of the ASME 2012 International Design Engineering Technical Conference & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE12), Paper Number: DETC2012-70780, Chicago, U.S.) to cloud manufacturing were introduced. Cloud manufacturing is a type of parallel, networked, and distributed system consisting of an integrated and inter-connected virtualized service pool (manufacturing cloud) of manufacturing resources and capabilities as well as capabilities of intelligent management and on-demand use of services to provide solutions for all kinds of users involved in the whole lifecycle of manufacturing.

Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 17(3):449-457  Types  Cloud Manufacturing can be divided into two categories. Jingeng Mai, Lin Zhang, Fei Tao, Lei Ren. Architecture of hybrid cloud for manufacturing enterprise [C], Asia Simulation Conference (AsiaSim'2012) & the International Conference on System Simulation and Scientific Computing (ICSC'2012), Shanghai, China, October 27‚Äì29, 2012, pp. 365-372. * The first category concerns deploying manufacturing software on the Cloud, i.e. a ‚Äúmanufacturing version‚Äù of Computing. CAx software can be supplied as a service on the Manufacturing Cloud (MCloud). * The second category has a broader scope, cutting across production, management, design and engineering abilities in a manufacturing business. Unlike with computing and data storage, manufacturing involves physical equipment, monitors, materials and so on. In this kind of Cloud Manufacturing system, both material and non-material facilities are implemented on the Manufacturing Cloud to support the whole supply chain. Costly resources are shared on the network. This means that the utilisation rate of rarely used equipment rises and the cost of expensive equipment is reduced. According to the concept of Cloud technology, there will not be direct interaction between Cloud Users and Service Providers. The Cloud User should neither manage nor control the infrastructure and manufacturing applications. As a matter of fact, the former can be considered part of the latter. In CMfg system, various manufacturing resources and abilities can be intelligently sensed and connected into wider Internet, and automatically managed and controlled using IoT technologies (e.g., RFID, wired and wireless sensor network, embedded system). Then the manufacturing resources and abilities are virtualized and encapsulated into different manufacturing cloud services (MCSs), that can be accessed, invoked, and deployed based on knowledge by using virtualization technologies, service- oriented technologies, and cloud computing technologies. The MCSs are classified and aggregated according to specific rules and algorithms, and different kinds of manufacturing clouds are constructed. Different users can search and invoke the qualified MCSs from related manufacturing cloud according to their needs, and assemble them to be a virtual manufacturing environment or solution to complete their manufacturing task involved in the whole life cycle of manufacturing processes under the support of cloud computing, service-oriented technologies, and advanced computing technologies. Four types of cloud deployment modes (public, private, community and hybrid clouds) are ubiquitous as a single point of access. * Private cloud refers to a centralized management effort in which manufacturing services are shared within one company or its subsidiaries. Enterprises' mission-critical and core-business applications are often kept in a private cloud. * Community cloud is a collaborative effort in which manufacturing services are shared between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns. * Public cloud realizes the key concept of sharing services with the general public in a multi-tenant environment. * Hybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain distinct entities but are also bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment modes.  Resources  From the resource‚Äôs perspective, each kind of manufacturing capability requires support from the related manufacturing resource. For each type of manufacturing capability, its related manufacturing resource comes in two forms, soft resources and hard resources. = Soft resources = * Software: software applications throughout the product lifecycle including design, analysis, simulation, process planning, and are only beginning to be embraced by the electronics manufacturing industry. * Knowledge: experience and know-how needed to complete a production task, i.e. engineering knowledge, product models, standards, evaluation procedures and results, customer feedback, and manufacturing in the cloud provides just as many solutions as the number of questions it also raises for manufacturing executives wanting to make the best possible decision. * Skill: expertise in performing a specific manufacturing task. * Personnel: human resource engaged in the manufacturing process, i.e. designers, operators, managers, technicians, project teams, customer service, etc. * Experience: performance, quality, client evaluation, etc. * Business Network: business relationships and business opportunity networks that exist in an enterprise. = Hard resources = * Manufacturing Equipment: facilities needed for completing a manufacturing task, e.g. machine tools, cutters, test and monitoring equipment and other fabrication tools. * Monitoring/Control Resource: devices used to identify and control other manufacturing resource, for instance, RFID (Radio- Frequency IDentification), WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), virtual managers and remote controllers. * Computational Resource: computing devices to support production process, e.g. servers, computers, storage media, control devices, etc. * Materials: inputs and outputs in a production system, e.g. raw material, product-in-progress, finished product, power, water, lubricants, etc. * Storage: automated storage and retrieval systems, logic controllers, location of warehouses, volume capacity and schedule/optimization methods. * Transportation: movement of manufacturing inputs/outputs from one location to another. It includes the modes of transport, e.g. air, rail, road, water, cable, pipeline and space, and the related price, and time taken.

Its parent entity, Dee Valley Group PLC had shares listed on the FTSE Fledgling Index on the London Stock Exchange, but was purchased by Severn Trent in February 2017. The company is regulated under the Water Industry Act 1991. On 1 July 2018, all of the water service area of Dee Valley Water and Severn Trent lying in Wales became part of the Dee Valley Water company, which was granted a new wastewater appointment and renamed as Hafren Dyfrdwy, Welsh for 'Severn Dee'.https://www.hdcymru.co.uk/about-us/overview/https://www.ofwat.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/2017/12/Proposal-to-vary-the-appointments-of-Severn-Trent- Water-and-Dee-Valley-Water- cons.pdfhttps://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03527628 The residue of Dee Valley Water lying in England (at Chester) was taken over by sister company Severn Trent Water. History =Wrexham Waterworks Company= After Wrexham achieved its Charter of Incorporation in 1857, attentions turned to a proper water supply for the town, as residents relied on wells and the River Gwenfro for their water supply, which contained trade effluence from the many breweries, leatherworks and brickworks present. In 1863, the Wrexham Waterworks Company was first established with the aim of pumping water from nearby Pentrebychan, West enough of the town to not be influenced by pollution. The first works, opened in the same year, were primitive, with only a reservoir and slow sand filter for water treatment, these were made obsolete by the construction of an impounding reservoir further upstream in 1878, this reservoir, named Cae Llwyd, has a capacity of . In 1904, demand had again increased, and the company now supplied parts of Cheshire as well as Wrexham. To meet this increased demand, a new, larger reservoir was built, named Ty Mawr, which opened in 1907. The same Act of Parliament that allowed the construction also authorised the name change of Wrexham Waterworks Company to the Wrexham and East Denbighshire Water Company. The construction of these works also enabled the construction and expansion of the treatment works at Legacy in 1921, as well as the construction of legacy water tower by 1934. Pumps had also been installed at disused mines, notably at Minera Lead Mines, to extract water in times of drought. Legacy Water Tower During the 1950s, there was a period of consolidation. The company acquired several other local water supply companies, including those at nearby Ruabon and Brymbo, as well as undertakings previously run by district councils. The company also took possession of the large water extraction works at Sesswick built by the Ministry of Works to supply ROF Wrexham during World War II. In 1983, the expansion of the company dictated that larger offices were required. The headquarters at Egerton Street were sold and the company moved to new, purpose built offices at Packsaddle, Rhostyllen.Dee Valley Water History =Chester Waterworks Company= A water supply system has been present in Chester since Roman times with water taken from the River Dee and small local sources.A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 part 2: The City of Chester: Culture, Buildings, Institutions There certainly appears to have been a well at Christleton to the east of the city in the 14th centuryA History of water in Chester and by 1537 records reveal a conduit being built from Broughton to convey water into the city. In 1838 the City of Chester Waterworks Company was established inheriting an intake at the causeway ‚Äì now called Chester Weir. The Chester Weir intake remains in use. =Merger= In 1994, the Wrexham and East Denbighshire Water Company was re-organised into a PLC, known as Wrexham Water, and the new parent company Dee Valley Group was established to act as a holding company to the new company. In 1997, the group purchased Chester Waterworks, and over the next year, combined operations from both entities into Dee Valley Water. In 2002, Dee Valley Group was listed on the London Stock Exchange with the ticker code DVW. = Montgomeryshire area = In 1974 the functions of Montgomeryshire Water Board and local authority wastewater functions in Montgomeryshire became part of Severn Trent Water Authority. Upon privatisation in 1989 these were transferred to the licensed water and sewerage company Severn Trent Water. This area is now part of Powys. =2016 takeover bids= In October 2016 the board of Dee Valley Water announced that they had agreed a takeover of the company by Ancala Fornia Limited.Title Ancala Fornia Offer This offer would have allowed the company to remain as an independent water company.

During his career he made some 30 to 40 captures of enemy, chiefly French, vessels. Despite his notable victory over the French privateer Superbe in 1806, for which he received various honours, including a medal, and his earlier successes, Fitton never received a promotion beyond the rank of lieutenant. Not only did he lack a powerful patron but there is some suggestion that he may, by injudicious conduct early in his naval career, have made a powerful enemy. He died in 1852. Origins Fitton was born at Gawsworth in Cheshire, the ancient seat of his family. Naval career He entered the navy in June 1780, on board , with Captain George Keppel. On 10 September Vestal gave chase to and captured the Mercury packet, having on board Henry Laurens, previously president of Congress, on his way to the Netherlands as ambassador of the revolted American colonies. During the chase young Fitton, being on the foretop-gallant yard, hailed the deck to say that there was a man overboard from the enemy. When Vestal sent a boat to pick him up, the man turned out to be a bag of papers, which being insufficiently weighted, was recovered. These papers compromised the Dutch government and led Britain to declare war against the Netherlands a few months afterwards. Fitton continued with Captain Keppel during the war in different ships, and as midshipman on was present at the relief of Gibraltar in 1782. =French Revolutionary Wars= In 1793 Fitton was again with Captain Keppel as a master's mate in the 74-gun third rate . In 1796 he was appointed purser of the sloop in the West Indies, and in 1799 was acting lieutenant of the 54-gun fourth rate on the Jamaica station, from which he was detached in command of one or another of her tenders. In 1800 Fitton commanded the 8-gun schooner Active. She assisted at the capitulation of Cura√ßao on 13 September 1800. As captain of the schooner Ferret he cruised the Mona Passage, in company with the cutter , commanded by Mr. Whylie. The two accidentally separated for a few days. On rejoining, Fitton invited Whylie by signal to come to breakfast, and while waiting caught a large shark that was under the stern. In its stomach was found a packet of papers relating to an American brig Nancy. When Whylie came on board, he mentioned that he had detained an American brig called Nancy. Fitton then said that he had her papers. 'Papers?' answered Whylie; 'why, I sealed up her papers and sent them in with her.' 'Just so,' replied Fitton; 'those were her false papers; here are her real ones.' And so it proved. The papers were lodged in the Admiralty Court at Port Royal, and by them the brig was condemned. The shark's jaws were set up on shore, with the inscription, 'Lieut. Fitton recommends these jaws for a collar for neutrals to swear through.' The papers were preserved in the museum of the Royal United Service Institution. Fitton's whole service during the three years in which he commanded the Abergavennys tenders was marked by daring and good fortune. Several privateers of superior force he captured or beat off. One, which he drove ashore, he boarded by swimming, himself and the greater part of his men plunging into the sea with their swords in their mouths. =Napoleonic Wars= When war with France resumed in 1803, Fitton was again sent out to Abergavenny and appointed to command her tender, the schooner . At the attack on Cura√ßao in 1804, Fitton was the only officer in the squadron who was acquainted with the island. The therefore piloted the ships in and had virtually the direction of the landing. On the failure of the expedition Gipsy carried the despatches to the admiral, and Fitton, in accordance with the senior officer's recommendation, received a promotion to lieutenant. In Gipsy and afterwards in , a similar schooner, he continued to pursue French privateers. On 6 January 1806, Fitton and Pitt captured the George. Later that year, on 26 October, after a weary chase of sixty-seven hours, Pitt engaged the French privateer schooner Superbe. came on the scene shortly before the denouement of the action, with the result that the French commander drove his vessel on shore at Ocoa Bay (now in the Dominican Republic), enabling him and his surviving crew to flee before the British retrieved their quarry. Superbe was armed with two 9-pounder and twelve 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 94 men under the command of M. Dominique Houx. In the engagement the French lost at least four dead and 10 wounded (three of whom were so badly wounded they remained on Superbe), while the British suffered eight wounded. Houx had on board a list of captures that showed a value of ¬£147,000. Houx afterwards equipped a brig, which he named Revanche de la Superbe, and sent an invitation to Fitton to meet him at a place named; however, before the message arrived Fitton had been superseded as captain by the 17-year-old Thomas John Cochrane, son of admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, who was then commanding officer of the Leeward Islands station. Fitton had the thanks of the Admiralty, a sword valued at ¬£50 from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund, and his share of the prize-money, but no command. Fitton remained unemployed till 1811, when he was appointed to command the gunbrig for the Channel. In Archer, Fitton captured the Danish schooner Thisted. In February 1812 he took command of the gunbrig for service in the North Sea and Baltic. In Cracker, Fitton captured the American ship America on 1 August. Then on 26 August, Fitton captured the American ship Dido, and shared the prize money, by agreement, with . Cracker was sold for breaking up in November 1815. Post-war In 1831 Fitton was appointed a lieutenant of the ordinary at Plymouth, and in 1835 was admitted to Greenwich Hospital. He stayed there until his death, which took place at Peckham on 31 December 1852. Fictional appearance The real-life Fitton was featured as the principal character in a series of eleven novels by the Welsh author Showell Styles, portraying actual events in the life of this naval officer.

France would retain its position as Europe‚Äôs leading automobile producer until 1932, and as a significant player Peugeot at this time offered a range of small, medium-sized and large cars. Nevertheless, the 183 marked Peugeot‚Äôs return to the two litre sedan/saloon class after an absence of 15 years. The company‚Äôs last offering at this level had been the Type 143, discontinued in 1913. The Type 183‚Äôs six cylinder 1,991 cc engine delivered a claimed 38 hp on the ‚Äúbase‚Äù 183 model and 183 A, 42 hp on the more powerful 183 C and 47 hp on the 183 D. The engine was mounted ahead of the driver and power was delivered to the rear wheels. The 183 and 183 A models came with a 2992 mm wheelbase, supporting an overall length of 4580 mm and a width of 1600 mm. Several body forms were offered including a saloon/sedan and a ‚Äútorpedo‚Äùwhich could seat up to seven people, while even the cabriolet version was able to accommodate four or five people. The car's roomy interior made the 183 a favourite with the Paris taxi trade. By the time the car was delisted, in 1932, 12,636 had been produced. Setting a path that the company‚Äôs marketeers would often follow in the decades to come, the Type 183 was replaced not by a car in the same class, but by two models of which one, the 1.7 litre Peugeot 401, could be seen as half a class down and the other, the 2.2 litre Peugeot 601, was half a class up.

The Ozieri culture (or San Michele culture) was a prehistoric pre-Nuragic culture that occupied Sardinia from c. 3200 to 2800 BC. The Ozieri was the culmination of the island's Neolithic culture and takes its name from the locality where early findings connected with it have been found, the cave of San Michele near Ozieri, in northern Sardinia. The Ozieri existed contemporaneously with the Arzachena culture, sharing some similarities, and its influence also extended to nearby Corsica. History Archeological excavations have identified some 200 Ozieri sites, located both in plain and mountain areas, but with a preference for low ridges, and largely organized around an economy of Hunter- gatherers mixed with an initial presence of husbandry and agriculture. The settlements consisted of small stone huts, with a circular (rarely rectangular) wall supporting a wooden frame with a ceiling of boughs. One, near Sestu, consisted of 60 huts. Another, near Mogoro, included 267 huts, perhaps also erected on poles driven into the ground, with pavements composed of limestone slabs, basalt cobbles or clay. Su Coddu, the largest known settlement, consisted of more complex structures and multiple room dwellings; located near Selargius, it has been partially built over by modern development, limiting the present understanding of its size. The finding of unique tools and objects in individual huts, and early evidence of metal- working, suggests the Ozieri culture was well organized and specialized. The villages had no walls, and findings of weapons in the tombs are scarce, indicating the Ozieri civilization was perhaps a peaceful one, very different from the later Nuragic civilization. The tombs consisted of rock-cut hypogeous structures that later became known as domus de janas, which were built underground or in rock faces, with the largest example being the Necropolis of Anghelu Ruju. Some tombs, of more monumental appearance, belonged perhaps to chiefs, in the fashion of those in Crete. The Ozieri burial practices differ from what is found in the region of Gallura (as a feature of the contemporaneous Arzachena culture), where the dead were interred in Megalithic circles. Ozieri pottery in its characteristic forms The Ozieri produced finely made ceramic pottery with complex patterns, incisions and surface decoration. Archaeological excavations held in 1914 and 1949 found fine worked vases with geometrical motifs carved in the clay and colored with red ochre. The oldest ones were still rather crude, while the more recent examples were more refined and slender. Such ceramics were a novelty for prehistoric Sardinia, since up to that point they had been considered typical of the Cyclades and Crete. The development of the Ozieri culture, therefore, probably stemmed from contacts with other eastern Mediterranean civilizations, in particular from the area of Neolithic Greece. The Ozieri culture appears to have been much involved in the obsidian trade, due to rich deposits on the island, which may have led to increased trading contact. Figurines recovered indicate the Ozieri may have worshiped a mother goddess, with the most well known example being an alabaster statuette found at Ponto Ferro Tomb, Senorb√¨, and sharing some stylistic characteristics with later Cycladic figures. Female statuettes similar to those of the Ozieri culture have also been found in Malta. Bull horns were recovered from tombs and elsewhere, indicating the sacred bull was also an important concept. The religious center of the Ozieri culture may have been the Monte d'Accoddi, a massive stone structure that was probably an altar, and has been called \\"the most singular cultic monument in the early Western Mediterranean.\\" Gallery File:Neolitico, cultura di ozieri, idolo femminile di tipo cicladico conbtraforo, 3200-2700 ac ca., da monte d'accoddi, tomba II (SS).JPGFemale statuette found at Monte d'Accoddi File:Neolitico, cultura di ozieri, idoletti femminili a forma cicladica e a placchetta, 3200-2700 ac., da thiesi SS.JPGFemale statuettes at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale G.A.

It began operating on 15 January 1973. Accounting standards All non-government business entities in Tanzania have been required to use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) since 2004, while until May 2010 government business entities were required to use International Public Sector Accounting Standards. As of May 2010, the NBAA clarified that some government- owned entities was now required to use full IFRS and others were allowed to use IFRS for SMEs. When using the IFRS standards, the entities had to use them in full and without modification from the form issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Professional qualifications The NBAA is an examining body for professional accountancy qualifications, but does not train candidates seeking to qualify as accountants. Instead, it works with various public and private training institutions. The NBAA serves both the public and the private sectors, although there have been weaknesses in its support for public financial managers. To address this, the NBAA worked with the Eastern and Southern Africa Association of Accountants General, the Federation of Accountants and Auditors General of West Africa and the English Speaking African Association of Supreme Audit Institutions to develop a PFM Qualifications Framework for Tanzania, which would be used as a pilot for the region. After evaluating and rejecting several options, the NBAA appeared to be leaning towards a mixed public/private sector curriculum for all candidates. However, there has been resistance to implementing this compromise. Associated bodies The NBAA is a member body of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). It was a charter member of the Pan African Federation of Accountants (PAFA). Dr. Mussa J. Assad of the NBAA was named vice president of PAFA at its inaugural meeting on 5 May 2011.

Plot A divorced socialite and daughter - Jo McBain (Rosalind Russell) - of a United States Senator - senator Reynolds- would like to join her boyfriend, who just left for Paris, where he has been transferred, with two other military comrades. After speaking with her father, he has the idea of her joining the army and getting her an officer's commission in the Women's Army Corps, so that she can be near her officer boyfriend and thereby be transferred to Paris. He sells her this idea, telling her that she would start as a general. Her wealthy and spoiled manners are crushed immediately, when arriving at basic training camp she is told that she would have to start at the bottom. Her father is involved in the telephone chain of people making the decision. Her ex-husband - Andrew McBain (Paul Douglas) - is working as an Army uniforms designer, and he uses his position to disrupt her romantic plans by making her join a group of girls who are testing polar equipment. After she has had enough of her ex-husband's silly pranks, she blows up at her commanding officers and is to be dismissed from the Army. Her contrite ex-husband admit his faults to the disciplinary hearing, but Jo confesses that she was faking being a good soldier so she could go to Paris and be with her boyfriend. She leaves the Army, but she made a lifelong friend in Clara, who tells Jo she will ask her boyfriend to marry her. When she leaves the Army, Jo watches as new recruits are brought in. She realizes that she's still in love with her ex-husband (and he with her). She decides to enroll back into the Army, a genuine attempt at being a good soldier this time, willing to do what the Army ask her to do.

Shape of the coalition =Overview= The INCEPR conducts eportfolio research through a series of staggered and overlapping cohorts serving three-year terms. Each cohort is formed, through an application process, by select faculty, staff, and administrators from approximately ten colleges or universities either in the US or abroad. Each cohort has its own research agenda, and each member institution proposes an appropriate study, provides updates on their progress, and reports findings to the other members of the cohort throughout the term. There have been six Cohorts thus far. =Focused agendas= Four of the six INCEPR cohorts have had research agendas that were focused in a particular area. Cohort I and Cohort II focused on reflection in eportfolios, Cohort III focused on integrative learning and student/academic affairs, Cohort IV focused on the relationship between personal development plans and eportfolios, and Cohort VI focused on assessment. Steven J. Corbett, a member of Cohort I with the University of Washington, reported on his team's findings for Inside Higher Ed: > In short, our findings suggest: most students take to writing with > technology quite well, and those who do not usually benefit from the > practice and explicit instruction; instructors and administrators sometimes > need just as much help learning about technological choices and options (let > alone teaching them) as students; and online writing environments do not > magically produce better student writing ‚Äî or better teaching practices ‚Äî > but can allow for practice with different composing and teaching skills, > which can lead to better writing, teaching, and administering depending on > the form (for example awareness of audio, visual, and design > considerations). =Partners= The coalition works with partner organizations, including the Center for Recording Achievement and the Higher Education Academy in the UK.

It houses three performance spaces and is home to The Rep, Point Park's resident professional theatre company, as well as three student companies‚ÄîConservatory Theatre Company, Conservatory Dance Company, and Playhouse Jr. The Conservatory Theatre Company offers five productions each year that are performed by undergraduate students at Point Park; each season consists of a mixture of established plays and musicals, as well as occasional new works. The Conservatory Dance Company offers ballet, modern, and jazz dance productions featuring Point Park undergraduates; these consist of works by established choreographers as well as new pieces choreographed by both students and professionals. The Playhouse, Jr. offers children's theatre performed by Point Park undergraduates; it is the second oldest continually running children's theatre in the United States. Playhouse, Jr. has also participated in the Pittsburgh New Works Festival. The Rep offers four productions performed by professional actors; the season usually consists of a mixture of established and new plays. The Rep has hosted regional premieres by such playwrights as Amy Hartman, Tammy Ryan, and Edward J. Delaney. The Playhouse moved from its longtime location on Craft Avenue in Oakland into a new complex on Forbes Avenue in Downtown Pittsburgh, adjoining Point Park University's campus in 2018.The complex features three public performance spaces; the 560 seat PNC Theatre, the 200 seat Highmark Studio Theatre, and the 99 seat Rauh Theatre. History The Pittsburgh Civic Playhouse was founded in 1933 as a non-profit community theater. The company organized a complete season for 1934 including The Silver Wedding, Morning Becomes Electra, and The Female of the Species. Although successful, the Playhouse had a deficit and recruited Richard S Rauh to provide guidance. Rauh was respected as a board member of the Pittsburgh Symphony and Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh. Richard S Rauh and Helen Wayne lead the formation of a seven- person executive board including Leon Falk Jr. and Charles Rosenbloom, creating the non-profit Pittsburgh Playhouse in December 1934. The executive board would oversee the financial and administrative affairs, both hired directors and stage managers, and a cast that would embody the community. Pittsburgh Playhouse was a civic theater company that was open to the community to perform alongside professional and semiprofessional actors. In December 1934, the first production of the Pittsburgh Playhouse, Art and Mrs. Bottle, was held in the Frick School. In December 1935, the group hosted its first theatrical production, The Wind and the Rain in a newly rented vacant building on Craft Avenue which would become their long term home. The first years of the Playhouse were led by director Herbert Gellendre. Although the Playhouse was having success, Gallendre had added an increasing number of professional actors to the company. His staging more challenging works such as From Morning to Midnight lead to an \\"art versus box office\\" argument with the executive board and led to Gallende's firing in 1937. Fred Burleigh was recruited from the Indianapolis Playhouse, the new director would remain with the company for the next thirty years not only bringing in a ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù filled with prosperity and professional actors but also expanded into a school and added two new theaters, Craft Avenue and Upstairs Theater. In the 1950s the Craft Avenue location housed the 250 seat Playhouse Restaurant in the buildings basement. It had its own water features, meat locker, onion-and- potato cellar and ice-cream parlor. =Rauh Family= The Rauh family were significant benefactors of the arts in Pittsburgh. Supporting the establishment of the Pittsburgh Symphony and a dozen other social/cultural organizations by his parents, Enoch and Bertha, Richard Solomon Rauh (1893-1954) was heir to a substantial fortune from his family's men's clothing business. During his time in New York, he met and fell in love with an actress, Helen Wayne. Shortly after graduating in 1933 from Carnegie Mellon with a degree in performance, Helen Wayne became a founding member of the Pittsburgh Civic Playhouse, where Richard S Rauh (1893-1954) first saw her. By 1934, Helen Wayne had become the ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù of the radio as an actress on the weekly show, The Charm Lady. Smitten by her, Rauh had promised to find her a stage to act on if she would not leave for Pittsburgh. The couple were married in 1935, Helen becoming Helen Wayne Rauh. Over the following four decades, Helen Wayne Rauh performed in 38 productions at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. Helen and Richard were married until his death in 1954. Helen and Richard S. Rauh's son, Richard E. Rauh has been involved with the theater for many years, leading the film series in the 1990s. The families continued support resulted in the black box theater in the new playhouse being named the Rauh Theatre. =Pittsburgh Playhouse Jr.= The success from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s brought an opportunity to William Leech an instructor for adult amateur actors to instruct children. The additional program to the Pittsburgh Playhouse was Playhouse Jr. Since its creation in 1949, the Playhouse Jr. has remained an educational opportunity for children to receive professional instruction on acting as well as perform on an actual stage. =American Conservatory Theater and Financial Crisis= By the 1960s economic pressures began to threaten the continuation of the Playhouse as an independent organization. In 1965 William Ball joined with the Pittsburgh Playhouse and founded the American Conservatory Theater with support from Carnegie Mellon University, and the Rockefeller Foundation. ACT was a fully professional theater, replacing the community theater model in use for 28 years at the playhouse. The ambitious 1965-1966 first season of ACT consisted of 12 productions in 4 months, all staged at the Playhouse. Some plays were Tartuffe, Six Characters in Search of an Author, Under Milk Wood and Tiny Alice. The change was dramatic, the plays were considered controversial, and Ball lost support of his Pittsburgh backers regarding the direction of the theater company. Long time supporters of the playhouse preferred the community, regional theater model of light comedies such as those featuring amateur actress and co-founder Helen Wayne Rauh in contrast to outside, professional actors. Ball and the ACT departed Pittsburgh, touring their productions after the 1965‚Äì1966 season, eventually finding a permanent home for the company in San Francisco in 1967. With the departure of ACT, John Hancock, an ambitious 27-year old from New York, was brought in as director for the 1966‚Äì1967 season. Attendance and subscriptions had dropped off significantly and the ambitious seasons had increased expenses and driven away corporate support, leaving the Playhouse in a tenuous financial position. Loti Falk (wife of Leon Falk Jr.) and Theodore Hazlett Jr. led a successful emergency effort to raise $300,000 in order for the 1966-1967 Playhouse season to continue. Hancock organized another ambitious season, staging Bertolt Brecht's A Man's a Man, Tennessee Williams A Streetcar Named Desire Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and six other plays, each of which were deemed challenging and controversial, in particular by some directors of the Playhouse board. The financial crisis and the perceived reduction in community support for the theater lead the Playhouse's executive committee to not extend Hancock's contract for the 1967‚Äì1968 season. As part of the decision to not extend Hancock's contract, 8 of the 40 directors on the Playhouse board resigned. After two seasons of conflict and financial emergencies, the Playhouse was in dire straits and looking for a change in direction and strategy. =Point Park University= After years of struggling for proper funding and the crisis of the two previous seasons, the Playhouse was acquired by Point Park University (then Point Park College) in 1968. As part of the purchase, Point Park also acquired the Playhouse School, which grew into the University's musical theater program, now ranked among the Top 10 colleges represented on Broadway. The support of Point Park has enabled the Pittsburgh Playhouse to remain a cultural entity even with the financial setbacks, including the downsizing of much of the tradition of Pittsburgh Playhouse. The company was able to include a ballet company in addition to director's hour. Locations =Craft Avenue= The first production of the Pittsburgh Playhouse, Art and Mrs. Bottle, was held at the Frick School. Shortly after, the Playhouse rented a 19th-century German social club building at the corner of Hamlet Street and Craft Avenue in the Oakland neighborhood. The first production was held here in 1934 with additional productions continuing at this location for the next seventy years. The Playhouse eventually expanded to three buildings around the corner onto Craft Avenue. The original building became the Rauh Theater. An adjacent house, purchase in 1951, became the lobby and theater offices. When the Tree of Life synagogue moved to Squirrel Hill in 1952 the synagogue building was added, becoming the Rockwell Theatre. The third theater was the black box Studio Theatre, entered via an alleyway on Craft Avenue. =New Pittsburgh Playhouse= Construction on a new theater complex on Forbes Avenue to replace the Craft Avenue location was announced in 2014. The original Pittsburgh Playhouse complex had many limitations, including being a converted set of buildings located far from the Point Park University campus. A new building would provide convenience to students, staff and audience as well as being purpose built as a theater. The new playhouse includes 3 stages: * PNC Theatre: the main stage, seating 550 * Highmark Theatre: a 200-seat space which can open to an outdoor courtyard on Forbes Avenue. * Rauh Theatre: a 99-seat black box theater name for long time benefactor Richard E. Rauh Preservation Concerns The project was criticized by some preservationists for removing terra cotta facades from three turn-of-the-century buildings at 320, 322 and 330 Forbes Avenue to clear space for the playhouse. One building, the Royal at 320 Forbes Ave., was the home of Honus Wagner Sporting Goods for over 60 years. About 95 percent of the fa√ßade pieces were salvaged. Point Park agreed to deconstruct the Forbes Avenue facades and feature them in a two-story outdoor plaza after determining that integrating the facades into the new building would be impractical and add $2 million to the project. One facade serves as the entrance to the Stock Exchange Building and cafe from the plaza's second level. The new playhouse integrated the former Pittsburgh Stock Exchange Building at 333 Fourth Ave. Built in 1903, the buildings covered and deteriorating three-story hall was renovated to reveal a series of stained glass skylights. The project renovated the hall to connect on three floors to the new playhouse along with the University Center and Library, a former bank complex.

It was created and written by its main star, actress Myrtle Vail. Characters and story The soap tracked the doings and undoings of the two close friends, Myrtle Spear (Myrtle Vail) and Marge Minter (Donna Damerel, later Helen Mack) with some of the usual soap opera twists (kidnappings, organized crime, murder) and injected a degree of comedy into a genre not usually known at the time for wit. Development and production Myrtle Vail thought of the idea while living in the Chicago area, after having spent several years as a vaudeville performer (often with her husband, George Damerel), basing it almost entirely on her own vaudeville experiences. She took the idea to the Wrigley chewing gum makers, who had yet to sponsor a radio show, naming her lead characters Myrtle Spear and Marge Minter (playing on the company's best- known gum), while casting herself as Myrtle and her real-life daughter Donna Damerel as Marge, with Myrt being the elder, experienced chorus girl taking young, inexperienced, and innocent Marge under her wing. (In the pilot, Marge was said to be Myrt's daughter.) Wrigley liked the idea and Myrt & Marge debuted in late 1931. Originally a prime-time entry, the show proved so popular with women that it was moved to daytime programming. The cast was described in a 1931 trade publication article as being \\"one of the largest casts in radio. Thirty actors and musicians take part in most of the presentations, and no member of the cast plays a double role.\\" In later years the show was sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive-Peet, who promoted its Super Suds laundry detergent among other products on the show. Tragedy struck Myrt & Marge first in 1933, when Vail was injured seriously in an automobile accident. This forced her to turn the show's writing over to a colleague named Charles Thomas, who wrote a storyline in which Myrt was kidnapped by gangsters, allowing Vail to recuperate completely. An even greater tragedy occurred when Donna Damerel died on February 15, 1941, aged 28, while giving birth to her third son. She had done a Myrt & Marge performance hours before going into labor. Vail was quoted (by Movie-Radio Guide) as saying she believed her daughter had wanted it that way and that the show should not die. She wrote Damerel's character out of the script for the interim, with the character of Marge hiding in the hills until a murder could be resolved, and set about casting a new Marge. The role finally went to film actress Helen Mack, but after just a few months with Mack playing the role, Myrt & Marge ended in 1942. Vail attempted to revive the show in 1946, in a syndicated version starring Vail and Mack, which sometimes included updated re-writes of the original scripts, according to radio historian John Dunning. However, the new show was a short-lived ratings failure, and the one-time favorite disappeared quietly in 1947. Approximately 110 episodes of Myrt & Marge survive, most from the 1946-47 syndication revival. Three ‚Äî including the show's pilot episode ‚Äî from its 1930s heyday are known to survive as well.Myrt and Marge, Archive.org; accessed December 14, 2014. Adaptations A film released by Universal Studios in 1933, starring Vail and her daughter, Donna Demerel, turned the show into a feature film vehicle for the Three Stooges, as well as their former front man Ted Healy. In the film, Myrt Spear's touring vaudeville revue is full of talent and bound for Broadway, but low on funds. Conniving and lecherous producer Mr. Jackson (played by actor Thomas E. Jackson) helps the show so he can romance the young star, Marge Minter. Myrt, and Marge's boyfriend Eddie Hanley (Eddie Foy Jr.), step in to save the revue and Marge. Ted Healy, Moe, Larry and Curly are stagehands with hopes to join the show, and deal with the antics of backstage crasher Bonnie Bonnell.

He is a chief of the Kayapo people, a Brazilian Indigenous group from the plain lands of the Mato Grosso and Par√° in Brazil, south of the Amazon River and along Xingu River and its tributaries. He is internationally famous as a living symbol of the fight for the preservation of the Amazon rainforest and indigenous culture. Early campaigns Cacique (a Native American word for chieftain) Raoni Metuktire was born in the State of Mato Grosso in 1932, in the heart of the Brazilian part of the Amazon rainforest, in a village called Krajmopyjakare (today called Kap√¥t). Born in the Metuktire family of Kayapo people, he is one of Cacique Umoro‚Äôs sons. As the Kayapo tribe is nomadic, his childhood was marked by continuous travel, during which he witnessed many tribal wars. Guided by his brother Motibau, at the age of 15 he chose to have a painted wooden lip plate (called ‚Äòbotoque‚Äô by the warriors of his tribe) placed under his lower lip. Raoni and other members of the Metuktire tribe encountered the Western World for the first time in 1954. Initiated into the Portuguese language by Orlando Villas-B√¥as, the eldest of the Villas-B√¥as brothers and a famous indigenous anthropologist in Brazil, the young Raoni was ready for the Kuben‚Äôs invasion (Kuben meaning ¬´ the others ¬ª, ¬´ white people ¬ª). In 1964, he met King Leopold III of Belgium while the latter was on an expedition into indigenous reservations in Mato Grosso. Deforestation was already a cause for concern when ‚ÄúRaoni‚Äù, a documentary film by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and narrated by Jacques Perrin was shot. Marlon Brando, known for his support of Native American people, had just been paid an unprecedented $3.7 million for his 10-minute part in Superman, but agreed to appear for no salary in \\"Raoni's\\" opening sequence. Brazilian media‚Äôs sudden interest made Raoni the banner- bearer of the fight for the preservation Amazon rainforest, which had been jeopardized by illegal deforestation, the increasing cultivation of soya beans, and the use of hydroelectric dams for the generation of electricity. 1989 international campaign Raoni with Sting in 1989 in Paris Raoni gained international attention thanks to musician Sting, who came to meet him in the Xingu in November 1987. On October 12, 1988, Sting participated with Raoni in a press conference prior to the Sao Paulo show of the ‚ÄòHuman Rights Now!‚Äô Amnesty International tour. After this event, Sting, his wife Trudie Styler, and Jean-Pierre Dutilleux founded the Rainforest Foundation. Its initial purpose was to support Raoni‚Äôs projects, the first being the demarcation of Kayapos territory threatened by invasion. In February 1989, Raoni became one of the fiercest opponents to the Belo Monte Dam project. Television broadcasts transmitted his opinions in Altamira during a large assembly of chiefs. Raoni in a conference in Brazil in April 2006 Raoni visited 17 countries with Sting from April to June 1989. The very successful campaign gave him the opportunity to raise awareness around the world about the deforestation. Twelve rainforest foundations were created to raise funds for the establishment of a huge national park in the Rio Xingu River region, in Para and Mato Grosso Brazilian states. Raoni's dream was to unite the five demarcated indigenous territories (Ba√∫, Kaiap√≥, Panar√°, Kap√¥t Jarina, B√†djumk√¥re) with then undemarcated Mekragnotire lands. Along with the adjoining Xingu National Park, the united indigenous lands would cover approximately 180000 km¬≤ (nearly one-third the area of France). In 1993, funds raised worldwide helped to make Raoni's dream a reality. The Xingu indigenous lands were reunited, creating one of the world's most important rainforest reserves. International Ambassador for the preservation of the forest and Amazonian people's culture Raoni and former French President Jacques Chirac in May 2000 at The √âlys√©e Palace. French president Jacques Chirac declared Raoni a living symbol of the fight for the protection of the environment. Since 1989, the Kayapo leader has traveled to many places in the world, including the northeastern parts of Quebec, Canada, to visit the Innu people in August 2001; and to Japan in May 2007. His messages were particularly well received in European countries such as France, which he visited in 2000, 2001 and 2003. Isolated from the rest of the world until the twentieth century, the indigenous peoples of the Xingu region have fought to orally preserve their traditions for countless generations. Raoni found ways to connect these cultures with the world, while keeping appropriate stoicism, distance and dignity. Although he meets with prominent people in many countries, he lives in a simple hut and owns nothing. The gifts he receives are always redistributed. During his media appearances, he is almost always seen wearing a wreath of yellow feathers and arrayed with Kayapo earrings and necklaces. He is easily recognizable with his lip plate that stretches his lower lip. Subsequent generations have not kept this tradition; Raoni is one of the last men to wear a lower lip plate. In September 2011, Chief Raoni was made an honorary citizen of Paris by Paris mayor Bertrand Delano√´, and received the medal of the French National Assembly from Nicolas Perruchot of France's National Assembly. In 2019, a group of environmentalists and anthropologists put his name forward as a candidate for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize for his lifetime defense of the forest. Opposition to Belo Monte Dam Raoni holding his international petition against the Belo Monte Dam in Paris. In an interview on French TV channel TF1, during Raoni's 2010 European campaign to France, Belgium, Switzerland, Monaco and Luxembourg, he declared war on the Belo Monte Dam project, which jeopardized indigenous territories on the bank of the Xing√∫ river in the state of Par√° (Brazil). He also reaffirmed his determination to protect the Amazon rainforest from a major disaster: ‚ÄòI asked my warriors to be ready for the war. I told the tribes of the High Xing√∫ the same. We will not be pushed around.‚Äô.¬´ Le chef indien Raoni ¬´ pr√™t √† la guerre ¬ª contre le barrage de Belo Monte au Br√©sil ¬ª, France 24, May 2nd 2010. During the tour, he visited France where he promoted his memoirs Raoni, m√©moires d'un chef indien¬´ Le combat d'une vie ¬ª, CulturClub ‚Äî La Terre vue du sol. He was welcomed by former French president Jacques Chirac, and endorsed Fondation Chirac, whose purpose was to preserve the cultures of indigenous people and the rainforest's biodiversity, including the creation of an institute in the middle of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. During the tour, he was also welcomed by Albert II, Prince of Monaco, known as an advocate for the protection of nature. The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy declined to welcome Raoni during the tour, even though he invited Raoni to France in September 2009 during an official visit to Brazil.¬´ Rencontre avec Raoni, Grand chef du peuple des Kayapos au Br√©sil ¬ª, m√©diath√®que de l‚Äô√âlys√©e, September 8th 2009. The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), last defence against the construction of the Belo Monte dam, delivered the licence to the consortium of Brazilian companies Norte Energia on June 1, 2011. This information has been forwarded by the media and social networks all over the world with a picture of Raoni crying. The caption added that his tears were provoked by the announcement of the final validation of the project. Indignant, Chief Raoni denied on his official website: ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt cry because of the authorization of the construction of the Belo Monte dam and the beginning of the construction (‚Ä¶). President Dilma will cry but I will not. I want to know who gave this picture and spread this false information (‚Ä¶). President Dilma will have to kill me in front of the Planalto Palace (Pal√°cio do Planalto). Then you will be able to build the Belo Monte dam.¬´ La col√®re de Raoni ¬ª, Chief Raoni's official website, June 6, 2011. ¬ª According to Amazon Watch his crying had nothing to do with the dam or any news related to it; it is a custom among the Kayapo to cry when they greet an old acquaintance or relative that they have not seen for a long time, as was happening when this photo was taken. In September 2011, Chief Raoni went to the United Nations Human Right Council in Geneva and participated to Rio+20 in June 2012. Raoni is not disheartened. He recently received the support of famous people such as James Cameron, Sigourney Weaver, Arnold Schwarzenegger,video of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger visiting Kayapo territories amazonwatch.org, march 26, 2011.

However, the President Dilma Rousseff did not hear Chief Raoni appeal and made her decision with little apparent regard for dealing comprehensively with its anticipated severe economic, ecological and social impacts, and with minimal consultation of the indigenous populations. In fact, the building of the dam was later suggested as a part of a huge corruption scheme in the President Rousseff government and Chief Raoni considered the biggest symbol of opposition to the Belo Monte dam.

It stands adjacent to the mill pond of Nether Alderley Mill, a loop of which acts as a moat. The hall is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is constructed partly in brick, and partly in timber framing, and represents an addition to the original hall, which was lost in a fire. History The Hall was built in Alderley Park in the early 17th century for Sir Thomas Stanley, High Sheriff of Cheshire for 1571‚Äì72, who then made it his family seat. Stanley had purchased the manor of Nether Alderley and other lands from Sir Edward Fitton of Gawsworth for ¬£2,000. His son Sir Thomas Stanley, a barrister, was made a baronet at the Restoration, and was High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1630. He made many improvements to the hall, including the construction of a stone-arched gateway at the front, extensive stables and the planting of beech woods near the mere. Following a severe fire in 1779 the baroque frontage of the hall was demolished and a new hall constructed to the south of the park, which has also since been largely demolished. Alterations were made to the remains of the old hall in 1912 by Edmund Warre and the building remains occupied. In 2011 the owner committed suicide in the barn after an armed robbery at the premises and financial pressures. The property was valued at ¬£5m.

It is the follow-up to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis-exclusive Air Diver. Summary After a vicious warlord threatens the nations of the world with a massive military invasion, the United Nations have recruited an experienced pilot by the name of Jake Steel in order to bring peace back to the world. The player will participate in a variety of missions against both air and ground forces and can fly in four different aircraft (the British made Panavia Tornado ADV, the Japanese Mitsubishi F-2 fighter, the A-10 Thunderbolt II and the F-14 Tomcat). The player can use the strengths of each airplane to their advantage along with their powerful weaponry such as M61 Vulcans cannons and heat seeking missiles against enemy jet fighters, tanks and other various enemies scattered throughout each mission. This game supports Mode 7. A sequel Super Air Diver 2 was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom. Famitsu gave it a 26/40. Sequel is the Japan-exclusive sequel to the Super Famicom video game Super Air Diver. The general idea of the game is that the player is launched into a 3D war zone with the task of flying a fighter jet. The player must defeat enemies with various weapons like missiles and gunfire as quickly as possible while obtaining as little damage as possible. Altitude is judged in feet while speed is judged in the plane's Mach number. The player is given the choice between two Western-made aircraft: a F-15E Strike Eagle or a Mirage 2000. The game was also planned to be released in North America as Lock On 2, but was cancelled for unknown reasons. Famitsu gave it 22/40.

Originally located on the corner of 2nd and Putnam, the two-story Georgian style home was constructed for Frederick and Rosa Linsell in 1904, by architect John C. Stahl at a cost of $9,000. The Linsells lived there for 10 years before selling it. After serving as a home for two more families, the building was bought by the Detroit Board of Education in the 1930s. In 1939 the building became the Women‚Äôs Study Building for the university. It was the only building of 16 on its block that survived the expansion of Wayne State‚Äôs campus in the mid 1900s. In 1956 the Board of Education donated the Linsell House to the university and it became the office for the School of Business, and later the Biology Department. In 1987 the house was restored and turned into the Dean‚Äôs Office for the College of Fine Performing and Communication Arts. The thirteen-room house is now located at 5104 Gullen Mall, in the middle of the Wayne State campus. Frederick Linsell Frederick Linsell was Secretary Treasurer of the William Wright Company. As an officer of this furniture decorating firm Frederick earned a comfortable lifestyle. He and his wife Rosa valued fine woodwork, and Georgian qualities. In 1904 at the age of 57, Linsell built the two-story brick house with a stable. Frederick and his wife Rosa lived in their house for 10 years before they sold it. Frederick Linsell lived to be 91. (1847‚Äì1938) Architect John C. Stahl John C. Stahl was a German American who also enjoyed fine woods. Stahl graduated from Central High School (Old Main) and went on to night school to study building and design while working in architectural offices during the day. Stahl was only 28 years of age when he designed the Linsell House. He crafted the house just to the liking of Mr. Linsell by incorporating fine woods and Georgian style windows in his design. Stahl went on to establish a successful career by partnering up and starting his own company named Stahl & Kinsey Architects. Later Stahl went on to design many churches in Detroit. John Stahl enjoyed a length career and lived to be 76. (1874‚Äì1951) Linsell House (Exterior Features) The Linsell House is an example of 20th Century colonial architecture. The two-story brick structure has a Georgian style with its beautiful palladium window positioned over its front portico. The windows are framed in stone and it has 2 chimneys asymmetrically placed on its roof. The Georgian hip roof make the house seem much taller.

Raj goes to the police station and filed a complaint.But the secretary sweet talks to the police officers and they told Raj that it was necessary to make those noises for security.The secretary decided that the whistling will begin 11:00 pm to 11:30 pm, 12:00 am to 12:30 am,01:00 am to 01:30 am,etc. An issue that starts out lightly and amusingly trivial begins to escalate to take the shape of a serious problem for Raj. He begins to slowly go to pieces. Not being able to sleep at night begins to take a serious toll on him, both professionally and personally. At work, he becomes edgy and his usual smart sense of judgment suffers. At home, he becomes obsessed with any loud noises in the environment. His disgust at being unable to solve a seemingly simple problem such as this begins to drive him crazy. Moreover, to his great irritation, no-one really sympathizes with his problem - not Abha, not Dev (Vrajesh Hirjee) - his friend at work, not any of the neighbours. It annoys Raj immensely, because he genuinely believes that this nightly noise-making is an illogical, uncivilized act. He did a drastic act. At the end, Raj due to lack of sleep by mistake sells a share in bulk in which the secretary had invested and both incur heavy losses. It was shown that Raj was supposed to move to a new apartment with Abha but Abha was sad that she left the old apartment and she went to her dad's house. On their way to their destined place, the watchman is no longer a watchman and is now a beggar. But the secretary, who was living a hard life makes his life even worse. \\"Hulla\\" is story of a simple annoyance that destroyed few lives but fixed one life.

Life Little of Butchill's early life is known except that she came from Saffron Walden, Essex. In about 1777, Butchill‚Äîunmarried‚Äîmoved to Cambridge to live with her uncle and aunt, William and Esther Hall. Like her aunt, she worked as a college bed maker at Trinity College. On 6 January 1780 Butchill spent the day in bed groaning and complaining of colic. She was tended to by her aunt in the morning and later in the evening. On 7 January the body of a newborn girl was found in the river near the Halls' home on the grounds of the college. At an inquest, the coroner‚ÄîMr Bond‚Äîdetermined that the baby had died of a fractured skull. William Hall believed that the infant was Butchill's and arranged for a surgeon to examine her. On examination, she admitted that she had given birth to the baby. She said that the child was born alive and that she had thrown her down a \\"necessary\\" (toilet) into the river and buried the placenta. Butchill was charged by the coroner's jury with wilful murder. Unusually for an unmarried woman, she was not charged as the mother, that is, under the Concealment of Birth of Bastards Act 1623. Under this act, it was a capital offence for a mother to conceal the birth of a child. Butchill was simply tried for murder, and convicted. Despite pleading for mercy, she was sentenced to death and her body was to be anatomized. She was executed on 17 March 1780 at Cambridge. According to The Newgate Calendar, on the day of her death, she was \\"firm, resigned, and exemplary ... reconciled to her fate\\".

He left school in 1956 and worked in various jobs, ranging from City clerk to labourer, Brixham fish sorter to chainman on the new Victoria line. He studied Stage Management at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. It was in this city that he teamed up with life-time partner/wife, Claire. In 1963 they joined the Unity Theatre before setting up the legendary underground political theatre group CAST (Cartoon Archetypical Slogan Theatre). Their debut was at the Peanuts Club off Liverpool St set up by Jeff Nuttall. They claimed their work was Agit-Prop, frequently performing on the still existing folk club circuit. Their short fast moving plays would feature Muggins characters who invariable are trying to make sense of the capitalist world. Their anti Vietnam play John D Muggins is Dead played in the Festival Hall and appeared in Peter Brooks U. S at the Roundhouse. CAST took Trials of Horatio Muggins and Mr Oligarchy's Circus to the Nancy Festival in 1969 they played student and factory occupations s. In 1970 the group split one half left and set up the Kartoon Klowns and later were the drive behind Rock against Racism. Claire and Roland reformed CAST, rehearsing every evening while in the day time Roland helped set up C.I.S Counter Information Services where they exposed the goings on of major global companies. In 1976 CAST won an annual Arts Council Grant and they began a ten-year period of writing two plays a year; the most toured being The Return of Sam The Man M.P a comic tragedy of the decline of the Labour Party. 1980, Roland received a Village Voice Obie award for his one-man play, \\"Confessions of a Socialist\\". In 1981, CAST set down a marker for the emerging comedy scene with its Sedition 81, a cabaret which executed the Monarchy, leading trade unionist amongst others, Roland gave a joint to the audience as a rebate from the state anticipating the arts cuts that the Tories planned in 1982, CAST created the New Variety circuit in London promoting a new wave of alternative comedy. Which went on to receive support from the Greater London Council, enabling it to run eight venues throughout London and establish the first modern comedy circuit? With performers such as Paul Merton the Joeys, Harry Enfield, Jo Brand Julian Clary and others, too many to mention. In 1986, Roland, Claire and others from CAST took over the iconic Variety Theatre, the Hackney Empire. Setting about modernising and restoring this jewel in the crown of the East End. The 1300 seat Hackney Empire became a permanent base for their operations and ambitions. Roland became Theatre Director and the building was re-opened on 9 December 1986. It went on to establish itself as one of the leading comedy venues in Britain, where many of today's top comedians got their first break. Notably through the pivotal national comedy and new variety competition The Hackney Empire New Act of the Year (NATY) Roland went on to co-star in the US movie \\"Bucharest Express\\"\\"Bucharest Express\\". When they parted company with the Empire in 2005, Roland and Claire left behind a fully refurbished theatre. Their company CAST Presentations took over the Cock Tavern in London's Kilburn High Road and presented nights of Comedy, Music and New Variety. With the Cocks Logo designed and donated to the company by the artist Ralph Steadman.

It is signed \\"Ticianus Faciebat / MDXXII\\" on the column of the panel showing St. Sebastian. History The work was commissioned by Altobello Averoldi, papal legate to Venice, from Titian during the period when he was the official painter of the Republic of Venice. The work was delivered in 1522, as indicated by Titian's signature in the lower right panel. The large polyptych was placed behind the high altar of the church of Santi Nazaro e Celso of Brescia, replacing another altarpiece by Vincenzo Foppa (of which now a Nativity of Jesus remains in the church of Santa Maria Assunta at Chiesanuova, as well as two side panels in the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo). At this time Brescia formed part of Venice's mainland possessions. A first version of the St. Sebastian panel was offered to Duke Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara in compensation for Titian's late completion of his Bacchanalia. The Duke declined the offer, and the early St. Sebastian was perhaps sent to Mantua, where one such painting is mentioned among the works of art sold by the Gonzaga to Charles I of England. Its whereabouts after that are unknown. Averoldi subsequently also started to complain about Titian's late delivery. Description The use of a compartmentally-divided polyptych, a solution that must have been rather old-fashioned for the time, is likely to have followed a specific request from Averoldi. In any event, Titian managed to produce a certain degree of unity, although not spatially or architecturally, unlike 15th century polyptychs. Instead, the Veneto-born painter adopted a chromatic-dynamic, with a sense of light converging towards the central scene. The panels are: *Resurrection of Christ, 278x122 cm *Saints Nazarius and Celsus with Donor, 170x65 cm *Saint Sebastian, 170x65 *Angel of the Annunciation, 79x65 cm *Annunciation of the Virgin, 79x65 cm The work inspired several Renaissance painters from the Brescia area, including Savoldo and Moretto The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian =Resurrection= The central scene depicts a triumphant risen Christ, high above, in a dark yellow and grey dawn sky. He holds aloft the banner of the Crusader saint, St. George, as an emblem of the Christian Catholic church. Beneath him is a group of armour-clad soldiers. The work shows the influence of works by Raphael, such as the Transfiguration (the centripetal position of Christ) and the fresco of the Deliverance of Saint Peter for the quasi-night atmosphere. Another possible influence that has been suggested here is that of Danube school, in details such as the dramatic lighting effects on the landscape. A depiction of the ideal Jerusalem in the background was a Northern European fashion. =Saints Nazarius and Celsus with Donor= The left panel show the saints Nazarius and Celsus, to whom the church housing the altar was dedicated, on a gloomy background. Nazarius wears shining armor, his disciple, Celsus, behind him. The kneeling donor, Altobello Averoldi, the papal legate to Venice, is portrayed in profile, stylistically reminiscent of the depiction of Sigismondo de' Conti in Raphael's Madonna of Foligno. The influence of Giorgione, who before his death in 1510 had worked with Titian, may be discerned in the calm atmosphere and the dull colors. Preparatory drawing for St. Sebastian, now in Frankfurt's St√§del. =Saint Sebastian= The right-hand panel shows a traditional Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, although in this case the saint is depicted in a rather contorted position. This may be derived from Michelangelo's Punishment of Aman on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, or from Raphael's Fire in the Borgo also in the Vatican. The saint's arms are tied to a tree trunk at different heights; the legs are also differently articulated because Sebastian's right foot rests on a section of a fallen stone column. It has been suggested that the saint's face resembles that of the risen Christ in the central panel. Some resemblance has also been claimed to Titian himself; he was 30-years-old at the time. In the background of this panel is an announcing angel. His gaze is directed towards Sebastian and to Saint Roch whom she is attending: prayers to both saints were invoked as a protection against the plague, and Roch's uncovered legs show the characteristic lesions. Two preparatory drawings of the panel exist: one (16.2 x 13.6 cm) is at the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin, and another (18.3 x 11.5 cm) is in the St√§del in Frankfurt. Angel of the Annunciation =Annunciation= The two upper panels make up an Annunciation, with the announcing angel on the left and the Virgin on the right, according to a tradition dating from the Middle Ages. Titian represented the two figures in strong light, in particular the angel, which is illuminated from behind. His figure is unrolling a cartouche with the Gospel words Ave Gratia Plena, the salutation of the archangel Gabriel to the virgin Mary.

It was Peugeot‚Äôs first large car since before the First World War and its arrival recalled the Peugeot Type 135 which had ceased production in 1913. However, the 156 was larger and more powerful. Peugeot type 156 The six-cylinder sleeve-valve 5,954 cc engine was Peugeot‚Äôs first production sleeve-valve unit. It was positioned ahead of the driver and drove the rear wheels. A top speed of 90 km/h (56 mph) was claimed and slower than the 3L 175 torpedo sport The 156 featured a massive 3670 mm wheelbase, supporting an overall length of 4800 mm. Available bodies included a large ‚Äúlimousine‚Äù saloon/sedan, a ‚Äútorpedo‚Äù, a cabriolet and a ‚Äúcoup√©-landaulet‚Äù. The car could accommodate between four and six people, according to the body specified. It may, in part, be a mark of the impact of war and post war depression on the French economy that whereas Peugeot had sold 376 of their Type 135 model between 1911 and 1913, only 180 Type 156s were built between 1921 and 1923. Nevertheless, one of the car‚Äôs users was the French President. The Type 156 was also used by Peugeot themselves as a test-bed for experiments with diesel-powered cars. The significance of these activities for the company‚Äôs future was probably not widely appreciated at the time, however, and it would be nearly four decades before Peugeot would follow Mercedes-Benz in progressing to the use of diesel engines in production cars. The 156 was Peugeot‚Äôs last series production luxury car of this size. The company produced subsequent luxury cars, but when 156 production ended in 1923, the Peugeot Type 174 introduced also in 1923, was smaller than the Type 156, and its six-cylinder engine had a capacity of ‚Äúonly‚Äù 3,828 cc.

Description The five chapters of the book are fragments from the travel books Labels (1930), Remote People (1931), Ninety- Two Days (1934), and Waugh In Abyssinia (1936). The author writes that these pages are all that he wishes to preserve of the four books.Evelyn Waugh, When The Going Was Good, 1946. Summary =\\"A pleasure cruise in 1929\\" (from Labels)= Waugh begins the cruise at Monaco; he writes: \\"I soon found my fellow passengers and their behaviour in the different places we visited a far more absorbing study than the places themselves.\\" At Naples he visits the Church of Sansevero. The ship stops at Catania in Sicily, and at Haifa. It continues to Port Said, where he and two other passengers \\"spent two or three evenings investigating the night-town.... We set out... rather apprehensively, with a carefully calculated minimum of money, and life-preservers....\\" At Cairo he stays at the Mena House Hotel, and at Sakkara he visits the ancient tombs. He visits Malta and Crete, where he goes to the museum \\"to admire the barbarities of Minoan culture\\", and visits Cnossos, where Arthur Evans is reconstructing the palace. Continuing the tour, other places briefly described are Constantinople, Athens, Algiers, Gibraltar, Seville and Lisbon. =\\"A coronation in 1930\\" (from Remote People)= Waugh travels to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, to attend the coronation of Ras Tafari. At the hotel he meets Irene Ravensdale, a friend. Waugh writes: \\"It is to Alice in Wonderland that my thoughts recur in seeking some historical parallel for life in Addis Ababa.... the peculiar flavour of galvanised and translated reality....\\" He attends the ceremony. Delegations afterwards leave wreathes at the mausoleum of Menelik and Zauditu. Waugh and Irene Ravensdale are among about eighty guests imvited to lunch with the Emperor. At the suggestion of an American academic who is attending the events (named \\"Professor W\\" in the book: this was Thomas Whittemore\\"Whittemore, Thomas\\" Dictionary of Art Historians. Retrieved 8 August 2020.), he and Waugh visit Debra Lebanos, where there is a monastery. Waugh returns to Addis Ababa; he accompanies the British consul in Harar, Mr Plowman, to Harar, and there meets the bishop, who recalls Arthur Rimbaud living in the city. =\\"Globe-trotting in 1930‚Äì1\\" (from Remote People)= Waugh visits Aden, and studies the buildings and people. He meets a local businessman, and a walk with him turns out to involve strenuous rock-climbing. Waugh has an audience with the Sultan of Lahej. He sails to Zanzibar, where he stays at the English Club; he finds the heat intolerable. He visits Pemba Island. He leaves for Kenya; at Nairobi he is a temporary member of the Muthaiga Country Club, and goes to the races with other members. He drives through the Rift Valley, admiring the scenerery: \\"all around for immense distances successive crests of highland\\"; at Lake Naivasha he stays with a farmer at Njoro. He goes to Uganda and stays at Jinja. Conscious of an inclination to return to Europe, Waugh does not pause during the remaining journey. At Kigoma he travels on a steamer on Lake Tanganyika, enduring a thunderstorm, to Albertville (now Kalemie). At Kabalo he travels to Bukama along the river by paddle-steamer, then by train to Elizabethville. There is a six-day train journey to Cape Town, from where he sails to Southampton. =\\"A journey to Brazil in 1932\\" (from Ninety-two Days)= Waugh sails to Georgetown in South America, where he prepares a journey through Guyana. He accompanies Mr Bain, the District Commissoner, for part of the way, by train to New Amsterdam, up the Berbice River by paddle-steamer for three days, and on horseback through grassland and bush for six days to Bain's office in the only house at Kurupukari, a clearing by the Essequibo River. Across the river, Waugh continues with local assistants, until they reach the Ireng River at the border with Brazil; Waugh stays for ten days at the mission St Ignatius. After another four days' travelling Waugh crosses the Branco River and arrives at Boa Vista. He is disappointed: \\"The Boa Vista of my imagination had come to grief.... All that extravagant and highly improbable expectation had been obliterated like a sand castle beneath the encroaching tide.\\" He stays at the Benedictine Mission. He abandons his idea of continuing to Manaos, noticing that people are often in fever. \\"It seemed to me a poor gamble to risk becoming semi-invalid for life for the dubious interest of a voyage down the Rio Branco.\\" He recrosses the river to begin the return journey. =\\"A war in 1935\\" (from Waugh in Abyssinia)= Waugh is in Addis Abada as a war correspondent to cover the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. He is one of several journalists there including Patrick Balfour. There is nothing to report, so he travels with Balfour to Dirre-Dowa and Jijiga; there he finds minor stories which are ignored by his newspaper in London, who tells him he has missed something important in Addis Ababa. Returning there, he finds there are more journalists: \\"They showed almost every diversity which the human species produces.\\" An announcement from the palace, that Italy has dropped bombs on Adowa, turns out to be a mistake. An attempt to reach Dessye fails because he does not have permission; he later successfully arrives. There is nothing to do. \\"Several journalists had already been recalled... now a general retreat began.\\" His newspaper dismisses him, and he is able to fulfil his wish to spend Christmas in Bethlehem.

Beginnings The first evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century, where the town came to be known as Readingum. The name comes from the Readingas, an Anglo-Saxon tribe whose name means \\"Reada's People\\" in Old English. The name Reada is thought to literally mean \\"The Red One.\\"Cameron, K., (1961) English Place-names, Batsford, p. 64.Transactions of the Historical Society of Berks. County, By Historical Society of Berks. County, Published by The Society, 1910: v.2 (1905‚Äì10) p. 164 In late 870 an army of Danes invaded the then kingdom of Wessex and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, the first Battle of Reading took place, when an army led by King Ethelred and his brother Alfred the Great attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and this account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of the town of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to winter quarters in London. After the Battle of Hastings and the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror gave land in and around Reading to his foundation of Battle Abbey. In its 1086 Domesday Book listing, the town was explicitly described as a borough. The presence of six mills is recorded, with four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle Abbey. Time of the Abbey Reading Abbey Reading Abbey was founded by Henry I in 1121, and he is buried within the Abbey grounds. As part of his endowments, he gave the abbey his lands within Reading, along with land at Cholsey. He also arranged for the land previously owned by Battle Abbey to be transferred to Reading Abbey, in return for some of his land at Appledram in Sussex. The foundation of Reading Abbey led to the town becoming a place of pilgrimage and enhanced the town's prosperity. However the relationship between already established borough's burgesses and the Abbey was to prove strained at times. In 1253 Reading's Merchant Guild successfully petitioned for the grant of a charter from the King and negotiated a division of authority with the Abbey. However disputes continued over the Abbey's powers to raise taxes and appoint the Guild's officers. Even the title of the Guild's first officer was open to dispute, with the Guild and, on occasion, the King referring to him as the Mayor, whilst the Abbey continued to call him the Guild Warden. It is not known exactly how badly Reading was affected by the Black Death that swept through England in the 14th century. But it is known that the abbot of Reading Abbey, Henry of Appleford, was one of its victims in 1361, and that nearby Henley lost 60% of its population. In 1487, Henry VII granted a further charter that went further than previous charters, although still leaving the appointment of the Mayor/Warden in the hands of the Abbey. This charter, and a subsequent judicial arbitration in 1499, confirmed the Guild as a body corporate in perpetuity. Dissolution and war The Abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot, Hugh Cook Faringdon, was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered in front of the Abbey Church. The dissolution initially saw the Mayor appointed by the King's officers administering the dismemberment of the abbey properties. However, in 1542 Henry VIII granted the Guild a new charter that permitted the burgesses to elect the Mayor. The earliest map of Reading, published in 1611 by John Speed. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England followed closely by Colchester and Leicester, based on taxable wealth. By 1611, Reading had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth, as instanced by the fortune made by local merchant John Kendrick. At this time, Reading had mostly traditional timber framed houses, a few examples of which still exist in Castle Street, Market Place and other places. Often the front ground floor of the house was given over to retail activities, with family and lodgers living in the rooms behind and above. The town played an important role during the English Civil War; it changed hands a number of times. Despite its fortifications, it had a Royalist garrison imposed on it in 1642. The subsequent Siege of Reading by the Parliamentary forces succeeded in April 1643.Barr√®s-Baker, Malcolm: The Siege of Reading: The Failure of the Earl of Essex's 1643 Spring Offensive. Ottawa, EbooksLib, 2004 However, the taxes levied by the various parties left Berkshire 'in a miserable condition, hardly a sheep, hen, hog, oats, wheat, or any other thing for man or beast to feed upon'. The town's cloth trade was especially badly damaged, and the town's economy did not fully recover until the 20th century. Reading played a significant role during the Revolution of 1688, with the second Battle of Reading being the only substantial military action of the campaign. James II had stationed an advance guard of 600, largely Irish, troops in Reading to stop the march of William's army towards London. Seeing these troops as an occupying force, the people of Reading requested help from William, informing him of the Royalist positions in the town. As a result, a relief force of about 250 troops attacked from an unexpected direction, and forced the Irish troops to abandon the town. This defeat of James' troops by an inferior force, together the willingness of the people of Reading to support William, convinced James of the insecurity of his position and he fled the country. 18th century Caversham by Joseph Farington in 1793. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. Agricultural products from the surrounding area still used Reading as a market place, especially at the famous Reading cheese fair but now trade was coming in from a wider area. Reading's trade benefited from better designed turnpike roads which helped it establish its location on the major coaching routes from London to Oxford and the west country. It also gained from increasing river traffic on both the Thames and Kennet. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened the River Kennet to boats as far as Newbury. This opposition stopped when it became apparent the new route benefited the town. The opening of the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1810 made it possible to go by barge from Reading to the Bristol Channel. From 1714, and probably earlier, the role of county town for Berkshire was shared between Reading and Abingdon. The Assize and Quarter Sessions courts met in both towns, with the Lenten Assizes traditional held in Reading and the Summer Assizes in Abingdon. The county gaol was at Reading, but both had a house of correction, also known as a Bridewell, that held prisoners from various parts of the county. Towards the end of the century, Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth, lived at Bulmershe Court, in what is now the Reading suburb of Woodley. Although he moved to Richmond when he was appointed prime minister, he retained his local connections. He donated to the town of Reading the four acres (16,000 m¬≤) of land that is today the Royal Berkshire Hospital, and his name is commemorated in the town's Sidmouth Street and Addington Road. 19th century Map of Reading from 1830 by Ordnance Survey. In 1801, the population of Reading was about 9,400. During the 19th century, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre. Reading maintained its representation by two members of parliament with the Reform Act 1832, and the borough was one of the ones reformed as a municipal borough by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. In 1836 the Reading Borough Police were founded. The Great Western Railway arrived in 1841, followed by the South Eastern Railway, in 1849, and the London and South Western Railway, in 1856. The Reading Establishment, an early commercial photographic studio, operated in Reading from 1844‚Äì47 and was managed by Nicholaas Henneman, a Dutchman and former valet of William Henry Fox Talbot (a pioneer of photography). Many of the images for The Pencil of Nature by Fox Talbot, the first book to be illustrated with photographic prints, were printed in Reading. London Street in Reading, centre: Lovejoy's Library George Palmer, Broad Street looking westwards, c. 1890. By 1851 the population was 21,500. The previous year, the Reading Union Water Company had started construction of the works to resolve the shortage of safe drinking water that was affecting the growing town. Untreated water was pumped to the Bath Road Reservoir by a pumping station at Southcote Lock on the River Kennet, and filtered there before being gravity fed to consumers. The works were completed by 1852. The Summer Assizes were moved from Abingdon to Reading in 1867, effectively making Reading the sole county town of Berkshire, a decision that was officially approved by the privy council in 1869. The town became a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of Brock Barracks in 1881. By 1900, the population was 59,000‚Äîlarge sections of the housing in Reading are terraced, reflecting its 19th-century growth. The town has been famous for the Three Bs of beer (1785‚Äì2010, Simonds' Brewery), bulbs (1837‚Äì1974, Suttons Seeds), and biscuits (1822‚Äì1976, Huntley and Palmers). In the 19th century the town also made 'Reading Sauce', described as a sharp sauce flavoured with onions, spices, and herbs, very much like Worcestershire Sauce. 20th and 21st centuries Kings Road in 1979, on the right is the demolished Huntley & Palmers building. Compared to many other English towns and cities, Reading suffered little physical damage during either of the two World Wars that afflicted the 20th century, although many of its citizens lost their lives, or were injured, in the conflicts. The names of the dead are remembered on the Berkshire War Memorial at the entrance to Forbury Gardens, or on various suburban war memorials. One significant air raid occurred on 10 February 1943, when a single Luftwaffe plane machine-gunned and bombed the town centre, resulting in 41 deaths and over 100 injuries. Most of these were accounted for by a single bomb, which struck the crowded People's Pantry restaurant in the Market Arcade. In 1947, Phoebe Cusden, the then Mayor of Reading, travelled to D√ºsseldorf, Germany, in response to a request by the colonel of the Royal Berkshire Regiment stationed there. Discovering that the city was suffering extreme privation, she rallied support from residents and arranged food parcels clothing and toys to go to the area. In the year after her mayoralty she invited six D√ºsseldorf children to stay in Reading for three months, and set up the Reading-D√ºsseldorf Association to continue the connection, which has continued to this day. The town continued to expand in the 20th century, annexing Caversham across the River Thames in Oxfordshire in 1911. This expansion can be seen in the number of 1920s built semi-detached properties, and the 1950s expansion that joined Woodley, Earley and Tilehurst into Reading. Miles Aircraft in Woodley was an important local firm from the 1930s to 1950s. The Lower Earley development, started in the 1970s, was the largest private housing development in Europe. This extended the urban area of Reading up to the M4 motorway, which acts as the southern boundary to the town. Further housing developments have increased the number of modern commuter houses in the surrounding parts of Reading, and 'out-of-town' shopping hypermarkets. At the end of 1966 the Yield Hall multi-storey car park was opened, providing covered space for 522 cars. It was noted that the ramps were arranged to segregate up-traffic from down-traffic, with \\"one-way circulation\\" through most of the building. The local shopping centre, The Oracle, built in 1999, is named after the 17th century Oracle workhouse with funds bequeathed by John Kendrick, which once occupied a small part of the site. It provides three storeys of shopping and boosted the local economy by providing 4,000 jobs. As the largest settlement in the United Kingdom to be without city status, Reading has bid for city status on three recent occasions ‚Äì in 2000 to celebrate the new millennium; in 2002 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II; and 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee. All three bids were unsuccessful.http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key- statistics/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales- ks01-usual-resident-population.xls The murder of Mary-Ann Leneghan occurred in Prospect Park on 7 May 2005.

The Ural Mountains played a prominent role in Nazi planning. Adolf Hitler and the rest of the Nazi German leadership made many references to them as a strategic objective of the Third Reich to follow a decisive victory on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. As a geographic concept In 1725, Philip Johan von Strahlenberg first used the Ural Mountains as part of the eastern demarcation of Europe. Since c. 1850 most cartographers have regarded the Urals and the Ural River to the south of them as the eastern boundary of Europe, geographically recognized as a subcontinent of Eurasia. The Nazis rejected the notion that these mountains demarcated the border of Europe, at least in a cultural if not in a geographic sense. Nazi propaganda and Nazi leaders repeatedly labelled the Soviet Union as an \\"Asiatic state\\" and equated the Russians both with the HunsHitler, 5‚Äì6 January 1942 and with the Mongols,Kater, Michael H. (2004) Hitler Youth, p. 174. Harvard University Press describing them as Untermenschen (\\"sub-humans\\").

In a major conference on 16 July 1941, where chief aspects of German rule in the occupied territories of Eastern Europe were laid out, Hitler emphasized to the attendees (Martin Bormann, Hermann G√∂ring, Alfred Rosenberg, and Hans Lammers) that \\"the Europe of today was nothing but a geographical term; in reality Asia extended up to our frontiers\\".Martin Bormann's Minutes of a Meeting at Hitler's Headquarters (July 16, 1941). German History in Documents and Images. Retrieved 11 June 2011. Hitler also expressed his belief that in ancient times the concept of \\"Europe\\" was limited to the southern tip of the Greek peninsula, and was then \\"brought into confusion\\" by the expanding borders of the Roman Empire. He stated that if Germany won the war, the boundary of Europe \\"would extend eastward to the furthest German colony\\".Hitler, Adolf (2000). Bormann, Martin. ed. Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944, trans. Cameron, Norman; Stevens, R.H. (3rd ed.) Enigma Books. . In an attempt to influence Nazi policy, the Norwegian fascist politician Vidkun Quisling produced a memorandum for the Germans - \\"Aide- m√©moire on the Russian Question\\" (Denkschrift √ºber die russische Frage) - which expressed his own ideas on the \\"Russian question\\", which he described as \\"the main problem in world politics today\\".Dahl, Hans Fredrik (1999). Quisling: A Study in Treachery, p. 294. Cambridge University Press. He advocated the Dnieper River as a general division-line between Western Europe (\\"Germania\\") and Russia. This would necessitate the division of Ukraine, but he argued that this \\"could be defended from geographical and historical perspectives\\". Planning for a border Albert Speer recounted a 1941 episode in his post-war memoirs wherein he observed Hitler's early ruminations about the Urals.Speer, Albert (1970). Inside the Third Reich, p. 257. Macmillan Company, New York. The Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, traveled to Berlin in mid-November 1940 to discuss German‚ÄìSoviet relations with Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop. Already before this meeting Hitler determined that he would attack the Soviet Union the following spring, ordering the Wehrmacht to draw up a military plan which would later become Operation Barbarossa.Boog, Horst (1996). Germany and the Second World War: The attack on the Soviet Union, p. 45. Oxford University Press/Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt GmbH, Stuttgart. A few months later an army adjutant pointed out to Speer an ordinary pencil line which Hitler had drawn on his globe at the Berghof, running north-south along the Ural mountains, signifying the future boundary of Germany's sphere of influence with that of Japan. Hitler also mentioned the Urals in his recorded table talks several times; on one occasion he recounts how others questioned him if they were a sufficiently eastward boundary for the Germans to advance to.Hitler (2000), 5‚Äì6 July 1941. He confirmed this objective, but emphasized that the primary goal was to \\"eradicate Bolshevism\\", and that, if necessary, further military campaigns would be carried out to ensure this. He later stated that Joseph Stalin would be prepared to lose European Russia if he did not succeed at \\"solving its problems\\" and thereby \\"risked losing everything\\".Hitler (2000), 12‚Äì13 July 1941. He expressed his belief that it would be impossible for Stalin to retake Europe from Siberia, comparing it to himself hypothetically retaking Germany if he were driven back to Slovakia, and that the German invasion of the Soviet Union which was then under way would \\"bring about the downfall of the Soviet Empire\\". In a discussion with the Danish Foreign Minister Scavenius on 2 November 1942, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop stated that the Germans expected Asian Russia to eventually split up into several harmless \\"peasant republics\\" after Germany had occupied the country's European parts. On 16 September 1941, Hitler mentioned to Otto Abetz, the German ambassador in Paris, that \\"the new Russia as far as the Urals\\" would become Germany's India, but that due to its geographic proximity to Germany was far more favorably located for the Germans than India was for Britain.Kay, Alex J. (2006). Exploitation, Resettlement, Mass Murder: Political and Economic Planning for German Occupation Policy in the Soviet Union, 1940-1941\\", p. 80. Berghahn Books. In the above-mentioned conference of 16 July 1941, it was codified as policy that in order to \\"secure the safety of the Reich\\" no non-German military power would ever again be allowed west of the Urals (including non-Russian native militias), even if it meant war for the next hundred years. Hitler's future successors were to be instructed of this, if necessary. This was to be done to prevent any western powers hostile to Germany from conspiring against it with its eastern neighbors in the future, like the French had supposedly done with the Turks, and which the British were alleged to be doing with the Soviets.Hitler, 27 July 1941. No organized Russian state would also be allowed to exist west of this line, which Hitler clarified as actually meaning a line 200‚Äì300 km east of the mountains, approaching the 70¬∞ east longitude line the Japanese had proposed as the westernmost limit of their own influence. Heinrich Himmler went into some effect about how he envisaged the mountains during the 1943 Posen speeches. He stated that the \\"Germanic race\\" would have to gradually expand to this border so that in several generations time this \\"master race\\", as the leader of Europe, would again be ready to \\"resume the battles of destiny against Asia\\", which were \\"sure to break out again\\". He stated that Europe's defeat would mean \\"the destruction of the creative power of the earth\\". The Urals were noted as a distant objective of Generalplan Ost, the overall Nazi colonization scheme of Eastern Europe.Madajczyk, Czeslaw (1962). General Plan East: Hitler's Master Plan For Expansion. Polish Western Affairs, Vol. III No 2. =\\"Living wall\\"= Hitler later rejected the mountains as an adequate border, calling it absurd that \\"these middle-sized mountains\\" represented the boundary between the \\"European and Asiatic worlds\\", stating that one might as well accord that title to one of the large Russian rivers.Hitler (2000), 23 September 1941. He explained that only a \\"living [racial] wall\\" of Aryan fighters would do as a frontier, and to keep a permanent state of war present in the east in order to \\"preserve the vitality of the race\\". The theme of a \\"living wall\\" was used by Hitler as early as Mein Kampf (published 1925‚Äì1926). In it he presented the future German state under National Socialist rule as a \\"father's house\\" (Vaterhaus), a safe place which would keep in the \\"right human elements\\", and keep out those which were undesirable. This metaphorical building was to have solid and supportive foundations (Fundamente) and walls (Mauern), and could only be protected by a living wall (lebendige Mauer) of patriotic and fanatically devoted German people. The idea became more prominent in Hitler's mind as the war went on.Mineau, Andr√© (2004). Operation Barbarossa: Ideology and Ethic against Human Dignity, p. 36. Editions Rodopi B.V., Amsterdam ‚Äì New York. . On 10 December 1942 (as the Battle of Stalingrad was turning unfavourably against the Germans), he told Anton Mussert, a Dutch Nazi collaborator, that the \\"Asiatic waves were threatening to overrun Europe and exterminate the higher races\\", and that this threat could only be countered by wall-building and long-term fighting. On 20 April 1943 (Hitler's birthday), he had a discussion with Albert Speer and Karl-Otto Saur on a design he had personally drawn for a six-person bunker that was to be used in the Atlantic Wall, featuring machine guns, an anti-tank gun, and flame throwers.Speer, Albert (1976). Spandau: The Secret Diaries Macmillan Company, p. 58 He indicated that this design was also to be used for defence purposes at Germany's \\"ultimate eastern border deep within Russia\\" ‚Äî if the Axis had completely defeated the Soviets, there might have existed the possibility of either only any remnant Soviet forces, or the northwesterly mainland Siberian-located extremities of Imperial Japan's Co- Prosperity Sphere territories, going eastwards beyond such a frontier. Related plans Various German agencies assumed a number of different boundaries in the east. The administrative planning carried out by Alfred Rosenberg from April to June 1941 in his capacity as Plenipotentiary for the Central Treatment of Questions of the Eastern European Space (basis of the future Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories) for the territories that were to be conquered in the Soviet Union based the envisaged civil districts of the Reichskommissariate to a large extent on the borders of the pre-existing Soviet oblasts and autonomous republics, particularly in Reichskommissariat Moskowien.(German) Dallin, Alexander (1958). Deutsche Herrschaft in Russland 1941‚Äì1945: Eine Studie √ºber Besatzungspolitik, p. 67. Droste Verlag GmbH, D√ºsseldorf. This included even territory to the east of the mountains, such as the Sverdlovsk (Yekaterinburg) region. The German Wehrmacht assumed an eastern boundary at the A-A line (a limit along the Volga river between the cities of Archangelsk and Astrakhan), which was the military objective of Operation Barbarossa. In the later treaty with Japan, the Japanese proposed allocating all of Afro-Eurasia west of the 70th meridian east to the Germans and Italians in the case of a total Soviet collapse, but after negotiations the boundary was changed to the Yenisey river.

It was produced by Nordisk Film and broadcast by Sveriges Television in the series Dokument inifr√•n on 15 and 22 May 2005. The Gender War was also part of Evin Rubar being awarded the TV award Kristallen and Sveriges Television's equality award the same year. The documentary focuses on the national organisation for women‚Äôs and young women's shelters in Sweden, ROKS, an organisation helping young female victims of sexual abuse called Friends of Bella, former Minister of Gender Equality Margareta Winberg and Professor Eva Lundgren. Effects The documentary made a big impact on the debate in the Swedish mainstream media and had several major consequences. Uppsala University decided to make an inquiry into Eva Lundgren's research. Lundgren was freed from the official accusations but received severe criticism in the media; later the university increased her funding in compensation for the unjustified inquiry and stated their support for her in 2007. However, in 2011 she resigned from her chair and criticized the university for not doing enough to clear her reputation. The Riksdag discussed withdrawing funding of ROKS. Gudrun Schyman, spokesperson for the Feminist Initiative, questioned Rubar's main argument in an article in the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper on May 24, 2005. Some women's shelters announced that they will be leaving the central organisation ROKS because of the controversy. Ireen von Wachenfeldt announced her resignation as the chairperson of ROKS on July 6, 2005. The New York Times wrote that the film showed that militant feminism was widespread in Sweden and reached into official circles, and quoted von Wachenfeldt, who said that \\"men are animals\\" in the document. Swedish Broadcasting Commission complaints The aired program received a record number of complaints to the regulatory body Swedish Broadcasting Commission (a total of 174). The first complaints did not lead to a conviction and the commission report stated the film is aligned neutrally, but in one respect lacking in the requirement for objectivity. However, after another complaint by two of the other women that were part of the events described in the first part of the show, this part of the film was convicted of non-neutrality since their version of events was not requested \\"in time\\" and was not presented in the show. This decision led the makers of the documentary to file an appeal of the Swedish Broadcasting Commission to the Parliamentary Ombudsman for a conflict of interest, since one of the commissioners in the board, Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth, had been active in one of the women's shelters connected to ROKS. Their report has not yet provoked a response from the Parliamentary Ombudsman.

Biography John Carpenter was born in 1729 in Dublin. His father was a merchant tailor, of Chancery Lane, a respectable residential area near the law courts.Ph√°draig, Brian Mac Giolla. ‚ÄúDr. John Carpenter: Archbishop of Dublin, 1760-1786.‚Äù Dublin Historical Record, vol. 30, no. 1, 1976, pp. 2‚Äì17. His early schooling took place at South Earl Street, where, between the years 1744‚Äì1747, he \\"was associated with the Gaelic language and cultural circle which had formed around Tadhg √ì Neachtain, scion of a Connacht bardic family who had settled in Dublin.John Carpenter (1770‚Äì1786),Archdiocese of Dublin/Ard-Deoise Bhaile √Åtha Cliath: accessed 7 January 2012. It was probably under √ì Neachtain's influence that he compiled an Irish grammar, a miscellany of prose and poetry and a book of devotion for his personal use which included part of the Imitatio Christi in Ulster Irish. He also collected manuscripts written in Irish, particularly those of a devotional nature.Catalogue of Irish Manuscripts in Cambridge Libraries, (P√°draig de Br√∫n, M√°ire Herbert, eds.), Cambridge University Press, 1986, , p. xix In 1729, at the age of eighteen, he became a student at the Irish College of Lisbon in 1747, and was ordained a priest five years later. He successfully studied for a doctorate in theology, returning to Dublin in 1754 to begin his ministry at St. Mary's Chapel on Liffey Street. =Early ministry= During his early pastoral career, he gained a reputation as an elegant preacher and a zealous catechist who had built three schools for the poor and orphaned and managed to stay above diocesan party politics. He was not afraid, however, to challenge established, diocesan custom. In 1763, for instance, he put his name to a complaint that many parish priests were cheating their assistant priests regarding the chapel door collections.O'Connor, Thomas. \\"Carpenter, John (1729‚Äì86)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, http://eprints.nuim.ie/379/,PDF at http://eprints.nuim.ie/379/1/Carpenter.pdf, accessed 7 January 2012. In 1756 Archbishop Patrick Fitzsimons appointed him prebendary of Cullen. Fitzsimons and his colleagues bore enough confidence in his abilities to send him to the royal court of Portugal on behalf of Lisbon's Irish College, which had been confiscated by the government in 1759. During the 1760s he joined the Catholic Committee, becoming associated with John Curry and Charles O'Conor of Belanagare, in their efforts to reverse the Penal Laws. With O'Conor, he shared an abiding interest in the Irish language and its attendant culture. In 1767 Fitzsimons sent him to London as secretary to Nicholas Taaffe, Viscount Taaffe, who sought to negotiate the wording of the Test Oath. Taffe was impressed with Carpenter, and recommended him to his superiors for promotion. Archbishop of Dublin In late 1769, Archbishop Fitzsimons was described in a letter as \\"old, blind, hors de combat and perhaps already dead.\\" On 15 April 1770, Carpenter was appointed his successor, and was consecrated on 3 June of that year. Mindful of the limits of Catholic practise in Ireland under the Ascendancy, the latter ceremony had to take place in a private house. In 1773 he was invited to join the Dublin Society (now the Royal Dublin Society), an act of unofficial recognition that in the context of the penal laws was described by Charles O'Conor of Belanagare as: \\"...a revolution in our moral and civil affairs the more extraordinary, as in my own days such a man would only be spoken to through the medium of a warrant and constable.\\"√ì Cath√°in, D. Charles O‚ÄôConor of Belanagare: antiquary and Irish scholar. Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, 119 (1989), p. 154. Archbishop Carpenter held the parish of St Nicholas as his mensal, and \\"resided in a large house on Usher's Island...[saying] Mass in Francis Street every Sunday at eight o'clock.\\" Enjoying the support of his clergy, Archbishop Carpenter's first act was \\"to ensure that collections taken up at the church door were properly divided between parish priests and assistants.\\" Commenting further on these aspects of his ministry, his entry in the 2004 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says of him: > \\"An assiduous administrator, Archbishop Carpenter visited his diocese > regularly and his first publication was a set of provincial and synodal > constitutions. This appeared in 1770. His pastoral priority was to improve > standards of religious and moral practice among clergy and laity alike. In > this context, he was especially concerned about clerical drunkenness. His > social concerns were part of a broader political vision for he was convinced > that the maintenance of moral and social order was the best way to persuade > the government to relax anti-Catholic legislation. He enjoyed good relations > with Protestants. In 1773 he was admitted to the Royal Dublin Society, an > event described by Charles O'Conor as 'a revolution in our moral and civil > affairs the more extraordinary, as in my own days such a man would only be > spoken to through the medium of a warrant and constable.' This was an > indication not only of changing religious attitudes in the establishment, > but also of the widespread esteem for Carpenter's character and learning.\\" In related areas, he aided the publication of Alban Butler's anonymous catechism of 1777, while in 1780 he himself produced Butler's revised Lives of the Saints, which featured Irish saints prominently. He also oversaw the continuing of primary education for Catholics in his diocese. His work lessened from c. 1780 due to increasing ill health, but he was still able to continue lobbying for the repeal of the Penal Laws, a test-oath acceptable to Catholics, and gradually re-establishing the Irish Catholic church's link with the Irish government. A firm defender of property, and law and order, he denounced oath-bound secret societies such as those of Dublin workers who used industrial strife to gain concessions and working rights. Archbishop Carpenter died on 29 October 1786, and was buried in the graveyard of Saint Michan'sWebb, Alfred. \\"Archbishop John Carpenter\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, 1878, accessed 7 January 2012. in a plot owned by his brother-in- law, Thomas Lee.

He reigned from 1417 until his death in 1457 and he married to Sophia of Saxe- Lauenburg-Ratzeburg in 1420. She was the daughter of Eric IV, Duke of Saxe- Lauenburg. They had 4 children: Eric II, Wartislav X, Elizabeth and Christopher (who died young). In his youth, Wartislaw IX had some bad experiences. The High Marshall of Pomerania-Wolgast, Degener Buggenhagen was killed before his eyes in 1417 or 1419 by Henneke von Behr, the favorite of the Duchess Agnes, widow of his uncle Wartislav VIII. He did this because Buggenhagen had previously killed Curdt Bonow, another of the duchess's favorite. Henneke von Behr was prosecuted. Some sources say he drowned trying to escape from Usedom Castle; other sources say he was taken prisoner in his castle at Nustrow and executed in Stralsund. Probably influenced by these events, Wartislav IX agreed with the cities and nobility of his country on the establishment of a Quatember Court, to ensure the rule of law. From 1425, Wartislav had to share power in Western Pomerania north of the Peene river with his brother Barnim VII and his cousins Barnim VIII and Swantibor IV. However, he outlived them all and at the end of his life he ruled Pomerania- Wolgast west of Swine river alone. Like his cousins in Stettin, he had to deal with the ambitions of the House of Hohenzollern, who ruled neighbouring Brandenburg from 1411 onwards. His worries focused on the Brandenburger estates of Torgelow and Pasewalk, which the Dukes of Wolgast held since 1369 as securities for a loan. A peace treaty of 1448 transferred ownership of these estates to Pomerania. In the so-called Golden Privilege of 1452, Wartislav granted extensive concessions to the cities, especially the powerful city of Stralsund (led by mayor Otto Voge). A lasting legacy was the founding of the University of Greifswald in 1456. He died just six months after the formal opening of the , but he had arranged numerous grants and the fledgling university was financially secure.

The monastery with its church was built in the 16th century, with the monastery secularized later. The church retains its original function. The building with two courtyards was restored between 1999 and 2002 to become a community and cultural center, with the Museo de la Laca, founded in 1952, moved inside to take up much of the upper floor. This museum contains about 450 pieces from various parts of Mexico and Asia, mostly made in the 20th century. The complex also contains halls with permanent and temporary exhibits along with an auditorium and various types of workshops. The former monastery of Santo Domingo View inside the former monastery The former monastery complex was built along with the Santo Domingo church on a small hill overlooking the Grijalva River, in the second half of the 16th century, attributed to Pedro de Barrientos and Juan Alonso. The church portion is one of the best preserved from the 16th century in Chiapas. The former monastery is behind the large church with two main courtyards. It was secularized during the Reform War with the church retaining its original function. It underwent its most recent restoration between 1999 and 2002 in order to make it a community and cultural center for the city of Chiapa de Corzo, with the Museo de la Laca moving into it. It, along with other facilities and operations, is managed by the Consejo Estatal para la Cultura y la Artes of Chiapas (CONECULTA). The entire building is officially called the Casa Escuela de Tradiciones but it is most commonly called the Museo de la Laca, although this museum only takes up most of the upper floor. Mexican lacquer ware and the museum Display of lacquered bowls and gourds in the museum The Museo de la Laca (Lacquerware Museum) was founded in 1952 and is the only one of its type. It contains a collection of 450 pieces which were made between 1906 and 1980, from P√°tzcuaro, Quiroga, Uruapan, Olinal√°, Guerrero as well as Chiapas. There are foreign pieces from Guatemala, China, Thailand and Japan. There are demonstrations on the lacquering process. Lacquerware has a double history in Mexico. There was a form of it in the pre Hispanic period called ‚Äúmaque‚Äù ‚Äù evidence of which was found in the La Garrafa Cave in Chiapas. However, the Spanish also brought their version which had come to Europe from Asia earlier. Painting ceramics and other household items in bright colors and intricate designs did have a long history in the Mesoamerican period. The change brought about after the Conquest was in style with floral and bird patterns coming to dominate. Later, Asian imports brought via the Manila Galleon would also have an effect on style. Traditional Mexican lacquerware is based on the oil of a seed called chia as well as that of a plant called chicalote. This seed is toasted and ground then pressed for its oil, which is then mixed with a waxy substance from the female of the Coccus axin insect species. The mixture is colored with dyes of mineral, vegetable and animal origin and used like paint on the objects. Lacquered items include gourds (often used as bowls or storage containers), toys, wood boxes and furniture as shown in the museum. Other facilities in the monastery building In addition to this museum there are various other halls and spaces. Next to the halls dedicated to lacquer ware is a hall dedicated to Chiapa de Corzo artist Franco L√°zaro G√≥mez. This exhibition includes many of his lithographs and other graphic arts as well as some early murals for a total of forty five pieces. His works focus on the legends, daily life, and people of his hometown. The Alejandrino Nandayapa Ralda Hall hosts temporary events such as exhibitions of art, photography and more. Matias de Cordova Auditorium accommodates eighty people and hosts a film club on Saturdays. There is also a hall dedicated to the history of the building, and one to a permanent display of photographs, as well as a store selling local crafts including lacquered items. These halls surround two main patios, and fronted by various corridors built from the 16th and 17th centuries. Regular events include workshops for children and adults in folk dance, marimba, painting, writings and recycling. There are also guided tours available. The museum also participates in exchanges with other cultural institutions nationally and internationally. It offers workshops in lacquer, Parachico masks, woodcrafts, pottery, embroidery and more.

As part of the dark web, it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. The website was launched in February 2011; development had begun six months prior.Public statement from a Silk Road spokesperson 1 March 2011. Initially there were a limited number of new seller accounts available; new sellers had to purchase an account in an auction. Later, a fixed fee was charged for each new seller account. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation, \\"Silk Road emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet at the time, serving as a sprawling black market bazaar where unlawful goods and services, including illegal drugs of virtually all varieties, were bought and sold regularly by the site‚Äôs users. While in operation, Silk Road was used by thousands of drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and other unlawful goods and services to well over 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from these unlawful transactions.\\"Mulvey, Erin (January 30, 2020) \\"Senior advisor of the 'Silk Road' website pleads guilty in Manhattan Federal Court.\\" Drug Enforcement Administration press release. (Retrieved July 10, 2020). In October 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shut down the website and arrested Ross Ulbricht under charges of being the site's pseudonymous founder \\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\".Ars Technica, How the feds took down the Dread Pirate Roberts, 3 October 2013 On 6 November 2013, Silk Road 2.0 came online, run by former administrators of Silk Road. It was also shut down, and the alleged operator was arrested on 6 November 2014 as part of the so-called \\"Operation Onymous\\". Ulbricht was convicted of seven charges related to Silk Road in the U.S. Federal Court in Manhattan and was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.Benjamin Weiser, \\"Man Behind Silk Road Website Is Convicted on All Counts\\", New York Times, 4 February 2015. History =Operations= Silk Road was founded in February 2011. The name \\"Silk Road\\" comes from a historical network of trade routes started during the Han Dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD) between Europe, India, China, and many other countries on the Afro-Eurasian landmass. Silk Road was operated by the pseudonymous \\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\" (named after the fictional character from The Princess Bride), who was known for espousing libertarian ideals and criticizing regulation. Two other individuals were also closely involved in the site's growth and success, known as Variety Jones and Smedley. In June 2011, Gawker published an article about the site which led to \\"Internet buzz\\" and an increase in website traffic. Once the site was known publicly, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer asked federal law enforcement authorities to shut it down, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of Justice. In May 2013, Silk Road was taken down for a short period of time by a sustained DDoS attack. On 23 June 2013, it was first reported that the DEA seized 11.02 bitcoins, then worth a total of $814, which the media suspected was a result of a Silk Road honeypot sting. The FBI has claimed that the real IP address of the Silk Road server was found via data leaked directly from the site's CAPTCHA and it was located in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. Henry Farrell, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, analyzed Silk Road in an essay for Aeon in 2015. He noted that Ulbricht created the marketplace to function without government oversight but found it difficult to verify anonymous transactions. To sustain a steady stream of revenue, he started increasing oversight to ensure low transaction costs. To do this, he added measures to ensure trustworthiness with implementation of an automated escrow payment system and automated review system. =Arrest and trial of Ross Ulbricht= FBI Impact of the seizure on the USD/Bitcoin exchange rate Due, in part, to off-duty research conducted by IRS criminal investigator Gary Alford, Ross Ulbricht was alleged by the FBI to be the founder and owner of Silk Road and the person behind the pseudonym \\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\" (DPR). He was arrested on 2 October 2013 in San Francisco at 3:15 p.m. PDT in Glen Park Library, a branch of the San Francisco Public Library. Ulbricht was indicted on charges of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics, and attempting to have six people killed. Prosecutors alleged that Ulbricht paid $730,000 to others to commit the murders, although none of the murders actually occurred. Ulbricht ultimately was not prosecuted for any of the alleged murder attempts. The FBI initially seized 26,000 bitcoins from accounts on Silk Road, worth approximately $3.6 million at the time. An FBI spokesperson said that the agency would hold the bitcoins until Ulbricht's trial finished, after which the bitcoins would be liquidated. In October 2013, the FBI reported that it had seized 144,000 bitcoins, worth $28.5 million, and that the bitcoins belonged to Ulbricht. On 27 June 2014, the U.S. Marshals Service sold 29,657 bitcoins in 10 blocks in an online auction, estimated to be worth $18 million at contemporary rates and only about a quarter of the seized bitcoins. Another 144,342 bitcoins were kept which had been found on Ulbricht's computer, roughly $87 million. Tim Draper bought the bitcoins at the auction with an estimated worth of $17 million, to lend them to a bitcoin start-up called Vaurum which is working in developing economies of emerging markets. Ulbricht's trial began on 13 January 2015 in federal court in Manhattan. At the start of the trial, Ulbricht admitted to founding the Silk Road website, but claimed to have transferred control of the site to other people soon after he founded it. Ulbricht's lawyers contended that Dread Pirate Roberts was really Mark Karpel√®s, and that Karpel√®s set up Ulbricht as a fall guy. However, Judge Katherine B. Forrest ruled that any speculative statements regarding whether Karpel√®s or anyone else ran Silk Road would not be allowed, and statements already made would be stricken from the record.Bush, John (28 January 2015) \\"Recapping Week Two of the Silk Road Trial\\". TechCrunch. (Retrieved 30 Jan 2015). In the second week of the trial, prosecutors presented documents and chat logs from Ulbricht's computer that, they said, demonstrated how Ulbricht had administered the site for many months, which contradicted the defense's claim that Ulbricht had relinquished control of Silk Road. Ulbricht's attorney suggested that the documents and chat logs were planted there by way of BitTorrent, which was running on Ulbricht's computer at the time of his arrest. On 4 February 2015, the jury convicted Ulbricht of seven charges, including charges of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and computer hacking. He faced 30 years to life in prison. The government also accused Ulbricht of paying for the murders of at least five people, but there is no evidence that the murders were actually carried out, and the accusations never became formal charges against Ulbricht.Nicole Hong, \\"Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht Sentenced to Life in Prison\\", Wall Street Journal, 29 May 2015.Andy Greenberg, \\"Silk Road Creator Ross Ulbricht Sentenced to Life in Prison\\", Wired, 29 May 2015. During the trial, Judge Forrest received death threats. Users of an underground site called The Hidden Wiki posted her personal information there, including her address and Social Security number. Ulbricht's lawyer Joshua Dratel said that he and his client \\"obviously, and as strongly as possible, condemn\\" the anonymous postings against the judge. \\"They do not in any way have anything to do with Ross Ulbricht or anyone associated with him or reflect his views or those of anyone associated with him\\", Dratel said. In late March 2015, a criminal complaint issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California led to the arrest of two former federal agents who had worked undercover in the Baltimore Silk Road investigation of Ulbricht, former Drug Enforcement Administration agent Carl Mark Force IV and Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges.Two US agents charged over Silk Road.

In late November 2016, Ulbricht's lawyers brought forward a case on a third DEA agent, who they claim was leaking information about the investigation and tampered with evidence to omit chat logs showing conversations with him. In a letter to Judge Forrest before his sentencing, Ulbricht stated that his actions through Silk Road were committed through libertarian idealism and that \\"Silk Road was supposed to be about giving people the freedom to make their own choices\\" and admitted that he made a \\"terrible mistake\\" that \\"ruined his life\\". On 29 May 2015, Ulbricht was given five sentences to be served concurrently, including two of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.Sam Thielman, \\"Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht sentenced to life in prison\\", The Guardian, 29 May 2015. He was also ordered to forfeit $183 million. Ulbricht's lawyer Joshua Dratel said that he would appeal the sentencing and the original guilty verdict. On 31 May 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Ulbricht's appeal, and affirmed the judgment of conviction and life sentence, in a written opinion authored by the Gerard E. Lynch, United States circuit judge.http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/cc930aab-c965-4744-936c-acf7d41bc1c3/1/doc/15-1815_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/cc930aab-c965-4744-936c-acf7d41bc1c3/1/hilite/ The Supreme Court declined to review the case. = Other trials = In February 2013, an Australian cocaine and MDMA (\\"ecstasy\\") dealer became the first person to be convicted of crimes directly related to Silk Road, after authorities intercepted drugs that he was importing through the mail, searched his premises, and discovered his Silk Road alias in an image file on his personal computer. Australian police and the DEA have targeted Silk Road users and made arrests, albeit with limited success at reaching convictions. In December 2013, a New Zealand man was sentenced to two years and four months in jail after being convicted of importing 15 grams of methamphetamine that he had bought on Silk Road. Twenty-three-year-old Dutch drug dealer Cornelis Jan \\"Maikel\\" Slomp pled guilty to large-scale selling of drugs through the Silk Road website, and was sentenced in Chicago to 10 years in prison on 29 May 2015 with his attorney, Paul Petruzzi, present. Dealer Steven Sadler was sentenced to five years in prison. There have been over 130 other arrests connected with Silk Road, although some of these arrests may not be directly related to Silk Road, and may not be public information due to legal reasons. Products In March 2013, the site had 10,000 products for sale by vendors, 70% of which were drugs. (Archive) Drugs were grouped under the headings stimulants, psychedelics, prescription, precursors, other, opioids, ecstasy, dissociatives, and steroids/PEDs. Fake driver's licenses were also offered for sale. The site's terms of service prohibited the sale of certain items. When the Silk Road marketplace first began the creator and administrators instituted terms of service that prohibited the sale of anything whose purpose was to \\"harm or defraud\\". This included child pornography, stolen credit cards, assassinations, and weapons of any type; other darknet markets such as Black Market Reloaded gained user notoriety because they were not as restrictive on these items as the Silk Road incarnations were. There were also legal goods and services for sale, such as apparel, art, books, cigarettes, erotica, jewellery, and writing services. A sister site, called \\"The Armoury\\", sold weapons (primarily firearms) during 2012, but was shut down, due to a lack of demand. Buyers were able to leave reviews of sellers' products on the site and in an associated forum, where crowdsourcing provided information about the best sellers and worst scammers. Most products were delivered through the mail, with the site's seller's guide instructing sellers how to vacuum-seal their products to escape detection. Sales A flowchart depicting Silk Road's payment system. Exhibit 113 A, entered into evidence at Ulbricht's trial Based on data from 3 February 2012 to 24 July 2012, an estimated $15 million in transactions were made annually on Silk Road. Twelve months later, Nicolas Christin, the study's author, said in an interview that a major increase in volume to \\"somewhere between $30 million and $45 million\\" would not surprise him. Buyers and sellers conducted all transactions with bitcoins (BTC), a cryptocurrency that provides a certain degree of anonymity. Silk Road held buyers' bitcoins in escrow until the order had been received and a hedging mechanism allowed sellers to opt for the value of bitcoins held in escrow to be fixed to their value in US$ at the time of the sale to mitigate against Bitcoin's volatility. Any changes in the price of bitcoins during transit were covered by Dread Pirate Roberts. The complaint published when Ulbricht was arrested included information the FBI gained from a system image of the Silk Road server collected on 23 July 2013. It noted that, \\"From February 6, 2011 to July 23, 2013 there were approximately 1,229,465 transactions completed on the site. The total revenue generated from these sales was 9,519,664 Bitcoins, and the total commissions collected by Silk Road from the sales amounted to 614,305 Bitcoins. According to the government, total sales were equivalent to roughly $183 million and involved 146,946 buyers and 3,877 vendors. According to information users provided upon registering, 30 percent were from the United States, 27 percent chose to be \\"undeclared\\", and beyond that, in descending order of prevalence: the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Canada, Sweden, France, Russia, Italy, and the Netherlands. During the 60-day period from 24 May to 23 July, there were 1,217,218 messages sent over Silk Road's private messaging system. Similar sites The Farmer's Market was a Tor site similar to Silk Road, but which did not use bitcoins. It has been considered a 'proto-Silk Road' but the use of payment services such as PayPal and Western Union allowed law enforcement to trace payments and it was subsequently shut down by the FBI in 2012. Other sites already existed when Silk Road was shut down and The Guardian predicted that these would take over the market that Silk Road previously dominated. Sites named 'Atlantis', closing in September 2013, and Project Black Flag, closing in October 2013, each stole their users' bitcoins. In October 2013, the site named Black Market Reloaded closed down temporarily after the site's source code was leaked. The market shares of various Silk Road successor sites were described by The Economist in May 2015. On 3 May 2019 a similar website was shut down, and three German men were arrested by the FBI and DEA agents. The website, called Wall Street Market, allowed for the illegal sale of drugs and fake documents such as driver's licenses. Book club Silk Road had a Tor-based book club that continued to operate following the initial site's closure and even following the arrest of one of its members. Reading material included conspiracy theories and computer hacking. Some of the titles included mainstream books as well as books such as The Anarchist Cookbook and Defeating Electromagnetic Door Locks. Most of the titles on this book club were pirated. This book club still exists as a private Tor based chatroom. Direct successors =Silk Road 2.0= Alert placed on the Silk Road's homepage following its seizure by the U.S. government and European law enforcement On 6 November 2013, administrators from the closed Silk Road relaunched the site, led by a new pseudonymous Dread Pirate Roberts, and dubbed it \\"Silk Road 2.0\\". It recreated the original site's setup and promised improved security. The new DPR took the precaution of distributing encrypted copies of the site's source code to allow the site to be quickly recreated in the event of another shutdown. On 20 December 2013, it was announced that three alleged Silk Road 2.0 administrators had been arrested; two of these suspects, Andrew Michael Jones and Gary Davis, were named as the administrators \\"Inigo\\" and \\"Libertas\\" who had continued their work on Silk Road 2.0. Around this time, the new Dread Pirate Roberts abruptly surrendered control of the site and froze its activity, including its escrow system. A new temporary administrator under the screenname \\"Defcon\\" took over and promised to bring the site back to working order. On 13 February 2014, Defcon announced that Silk Road 2.0's escrow accounts had been compromised through a vulnerability in Bitcoin protocol called \\"transaction malleability\\". While the site remained online, all the bitcoins in its escrow accounts, valued at $2.7 million, were reported stolen. It was later reported that the vulnerability was in the site's \\"Refresh Deposits\\" function, and that the Silk Road administrators had used their commissions on sales since 15 February to refund users who lost money, with 50 percent of the hack victims being completely repaid as of 8 April. On 6 November 2014, authorities with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Europol, and Eurojust announced the arrest of Blake Benthall, allegedly the owner and operator of Silk Road 2.0 under the pseudonym \\"Defcon\\", the previous day in San Francisco as part of Operation Onymous. The creator of the relaunched website‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äî‚Å† ‚Å†an English computer programmer named Thomas White‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äî‚Å† ‚Å†was also arrested in the course of the shutdown, but his arrest was not made public until 2019 after he pled guilty to charges stemming from running the website and was sentenced to five years in prison. Among the charges White admitted to was creating child pornography, and chat logs recovered by police showed White discussing the possibility of launching a website to host such material. =Others= Following the closure of Silk Road 2.0 in November 2014, Diabolus Market renamed itself to 'Silk Road 3 Reloaded' in order to capitalise on the brand. In January 2015, Silk Road Reloaded launched on I2P with multiple cryptocurrency support and similar listing restrictions to the original Silk Road market. This website is also defunct.  Advocates of deep web drug sales  Meghan Ralston, a former harm reduction manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, was quoted as saying that the Silk Road was \\"a peaceable alternative to the often deadly violence so commonly associated with the global drug war, and street drug transactions, in particular\\". Proponents of the Silk Road and similar sites argue that buying illegal narcotics from the safety of your home is better than buying them in person from criminals on the streets.

Toxic workplaces are often considered the result of toxic employers and/or toxic employees who are motivated by personal gain (power, money, fame or special status), use unethical, mean-spirited and sometimes illegal means to manipulate and annoy those around them; and whose motives are to maintain or increase power, money or special status or divert attention away from their performance shortfalls and misdeeds. Toxic workers do not recognize a duty to the organization for which they work or their co-workers in terms of ethics or professional conduct toward others. Toxic workers define relationships with co-workers, not by organizational structure but by co-workers they favour and those they do not like or trust.Benoit, Suzanne (2011) \\"Toxic Employees: great companies resolve this problem, you can too!\\" Falmouth, Maine: BCSPublishing Quite similarly, Harder et al. (2014) define a toxic work environment as an environment that negatively impacts the viability of an organization. They specify: \\"It is reasonable to conclude that an organization can be considered toxic if it is ineffective as well as destructive to its employees\\". In the United States, the issue of workplace bullying is getting increasing attention from state governments; twenty-six states have introduced a version of the Healthy Workplace Bill which provides a definition of this conduct and support for employers to address the behaviour through discipline.The Healthy Workplace Campaign accessed June 14, 2011 at: http://www.healthyworkplacebill.org/ Studies by National Occupational Safety and Health found toxic workplace environments a leading cause of workplace violence such as ‚Äúviolent acts, including physical assaults and threats of assault, directed toward persons at work or on duty.‚Äù Studies on this issue include verbal violence (threats, verbal abuse, hostility, harassment, and the like) can cause significant psychological trauma and stress, even if no physical injury takes place. Verbal assaults and hostility can also escalate to physical violence. Corporate and organizational results This phenomenon harms both the company and the other employees, including those who are not direct targets. Co-workers are distracted by drama, gossip and by choosing sides in the ongoing animosity. This can translate into lost productivity.Bitting, Robert. \\"Using Effective Leadership Strategies in the Workplace\\". . Retrieved May 13, 2011. While employees are distracted by this activity, they cannot devote time and attention to the achievement of business goals. Positively motivated and ethical employees may try to speak up to a toxic employee but this can make them a target (see whistleblower). Managers of toxic employees can feel intimidated by a toxic employee and try to appease the employee in an effort to avoid confrontation. Over time, positively motivated employees drift away from the workplace and may begin to view management as inept and ineffective. This can result in poor job performance as they begin to feel less valued, therefore less loyal to the company. Fellow employees may begin to experience physical symptoms from the stress and worry over whether they or someone they care about in the work place may be targeted. This can even develop into a clinical depression requiring treatment.Davies, Andrews and Smith. \\"Do You Have a Toxic Employee in Your Workplace?\\" Retrieved May 13, 2011 Prevention and resolution Interventions to address this negative behaviour in the workplace should be undertaken carefully.

With its bolometric luminosity of at least 2,240,000 times that of the Sun (4,500,000 in some estimates), it was described as \\"the brightest nonstable star in M33\\" and is one of the most luminous stars known. The brightness varies slowly and unpredictably over a 1-2 magnitude visual range and can remain approximately constant for many years. These variations, combined with the high luminosity and temperature of the star, caused it to be grouped with the Hubble-Sandage variables even before the term \\"Luminous blue variable\\" was more than a simple description. Despite widespread agreement that it is an LBV it has yet to be observed in outburst, although the temperature has been observed to change in tandem with the brightness variations. Temperature estimates for the star range from around 18,000K to well over 30,000K. The hotter temperatures found from fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) are consistent with the calculated luminosity of an LBV in the quiescent stage, but the spectrum is that of a cooler star.

As a result, the 160 had a wingspan of just . The 160 was an all-metal design, with the wing skins, spar webs and ribs made from magnesium. The forward fuselage was built from a Lockheed P-38 Lightning drop tank. The wing employed a symmetrical NACA 0018 airfoil at the wing root, that transitioned to a NACA 0009 section at the wing tip. The aircraft had flaps that were mounted external to the wing and airfoil-shaped. The aircraft's empty weight was very light at . Only one Prue 160 was built. Operational history The Prue 160 was flown by Harold Huber in the 1947 US Nationals. It was later owned by Roger Freeman of San Antonio, Texas and James F. Jenista Jr.of Boulder City, Nevada. While owned by Jenista the aircraft was destroyed in an accident on 11 June 1994 at the Jean Airport in Jean, Nevada.

Retrieved 13 May 2011. Initially a hobby site, it became his full-time occupation after three years. Opera magazine describes the Operabase website as \\"the most comprehensive source of data on operatic activity\\". The public site By its tenth anniversary, in 2006, the site received \\"about 10,000 visitors a day to the public site, who look at over four million pages a month between them. Of these, fewer than half use English, 17% use German, 12% Italian, 10% French, 9% Spanish.\\" In autumn of that year the British magazine Opera Now reported that \\"Operabase has taken on the Herculean task of making [the site] available to every European Union citizen in their own language ‚Äì not only the 21 (as at January 2007) official languages of the EU, but Catalan, Icelandic and Norwegian as well.\\" As of November 2012, the free public area of the site is available in 22 languages, and includes 37,000 performances, 40,000 artists, 700 opera companies, festivals and theatres, and the contact details and rosters of 400 artist managers. The Operabase professional section Seven years after the public site was launched, a professional site followed and within three years, \\"200 opera houses from the Met to La Scala\\" were subscribers. The initial service offering for the 750 euro annual subscription fee had increased artist information and an opera casting tool. The casting tool was used for researching singers for a given role, but was particularly valued for finding replacement singers when there were emergency cancellations. The tool could not only put forward the names of all of the singers who had sung that role, but the artist schedules could be used to find if they were available, and the artists management and contact information could be used to make contact. The professional services now also include a global database of opera productions available to rent or buy. The database is now operated by Gibb and Muriel Denzler, who provide services to opera professionals for a fee, although the site is searchable by any web user at no charge. As has been noted by Gibb and Denzler in an article on the website of Opera Europa (the European opera service organisation similar to those which exist in the US and Canada, OPERA America and Opera.ca) they provide specialised services to opera professionals, with the site including \\"casting tools, artist records, management details, productions information\\". But they emphasise that \\"the site was originally created for the general public, who still provide 96% of its users\\". Opera statistics In autumn 2010, Operabase produced a set of statistics for the opera world to mark the 250,000th performance on file. These statistics were presented at the third European Opera Forum, organised by Opera Europa in London in March 2011. In autumn 2013, the statistics were updated to show the 2012/13 season figures. The Operabase rankings of the most performed operas formed the basis of a set of music questions in an edition of the BBC's University Challenge, broadcast in July 2014. Competitors were asked to identify three operas in the Operabase list from sound clips of Maria Callas. =Most played composers= In the five seasons 2008/09 to 2012/13, 2415 different works from 1161 different composers were played. The most popular composers were: # Giuseppe Verdi, with 2,586 performances of 28 operas # Giacomo Puccini, with 1,893 performances of 12 operas # Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart # Richard Wagner # Gioachino Rossini More than 600 of the composers played in this period were still alive.

Littlewood, who denoted it by {Œª} ‚äó {Œº}. The word \\"plethysm\\" for this operation (after the Greek word œÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏œÖœÉŒºœåœÇ meaning \\"multiplication\\") was introduced later by , who said that the name was suggested by M. L. Clark. If symmetric functions are identified with operations in lambda rings, then plethysm corresponds to composition of operations. In representation theory Let V be a vector space over the complex numbers, considered as a representation of the general linear group GL(V). Each Young diagram Œª corresponds to a Schur functor LŒª(-) on the category of GL(V)-representations. Given two Young diagrams Œª and Œº, consider the decomposition of LŒª(LŒº(V)) into a direct sum of irreducible representations of the group. By the representation theory of the general linear group we know that each summand is isomorphic to L_ u(V) for a Young diagram u. So for some nonnegative multiplicities a_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu, u} there is an isomorphism :L_\\\\lambda(L_\\\\mu(V)) = \\\\bigoplus_{ u} L_ u(V)^{\\\\oplus a_{\\\\lambda, \\\\mu, u}}. The problem of (outer) plethysm is to find an expression for the multiplicities a_{\\\\lambda, \\\\mu, u}. This formulation is closely related to the classical question. The character of the GL(V)-representation LŒª(V) is a symmetric function in dim(V) variables, known as the Schur polynomial sŒª corresponding to the Young diagram Œª. Schur polynomials form a basis in the space of symmetric functions. Hence to understand the plethysm of two symmetric functions it would be enough to know their expressions in that basis and an expression for a plethysm of two arbitrary Schur polynomials {sŒª}‚äó{sŒº} . The second piece of data is precisely the character of LŒª(LŒº(V)).

This cityscape was painted in traditions of the Leningrad School of Painting and Soviet figurative painting of late socialist realism with their typical synthesis of realistic and impressionistic traditions to create an image of modernity.  History  The painting is of special importance to the artistic reputation of Alexander Semionov. Created on the apex of his artistic career, five years before his death, it became one of his most famous works. In Malaya Sadovaya Street the artist presents the image of one of the most beautiful streets in the city, as well as a romantic and extremely attractive image of the Leningrad of the late of 1970s as at whole. In the painting Semionov convincingly conveyed a sense of time and place, the unhurried flow of Leningrad life. In the late 1970s Alexander Semionov - a recognized master of the Leningrad landscape, with his recognizable handwriting. This genre took a leading place in his work in the 1960s. The artist invariably painted his works from nature as sketches-pictures, seeking the transmission of a live direct impression, working with the same success brush and palette knife.–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –°. –í. –û –ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–µ–π–∑–∞–∂–∞—Ö –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –°–µ–º—ë–Ω–æ–≤–∞. // –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–∏–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–µ–¥—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Ç–µ—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏. –í—ã–ø. 23. –°–ü–±, 2012. –°.44. Semionov liked to painted the city in rainy weather, doing it with a special mood, masterfully passing the game of reflections on the wet asphalt, the shiny roofs of buses and cars, pedestrians under umbrellas, which are so consonant with our image of the city on the Neva. This theme was developed by him for decades and is reflected in the works Rainy Day (1958), Rainy Day in the Summer Garden (1961), On the Palace Square, On Kirov Prospekt (both 1965), Nevsky Prospekt (1977), Nevsky Prospekt in the Rain (1983), and others. In 1979, in Leningrad, with great success, the first solo exhibition of the works of Semionov was held, which opened of this original master to the Leningrad audience. Most of the works shown at the exhibition belonged to the genre of the urban lyrical landscape. The warm response that met his creativity, inspired the artist, he experienced a sense of recovery and genuine inspiration, the need to express himself and his attitude towards Leningrad in new perfect forms. Thus, the motif with Malaya Sadova was born, which the artist had long to seek. The classic proportions of the city-museum and the distinctive signs of the present, the recognizable architectural scenery and the city's equally obligatory signs, like rain, umbrellas and wet asphalt, the brightly drawn painter's picturesque accents and the general muffled palette, filled the entire composition with special Leningrad scattered light. So thanks to the inspiration of the master was created one of the most recognizable lyrical images of Leningrad in the 1970s.  Showing and publications  In the early 1980s a reproduction of this painting was printed by the state publishing house \\"Artist of the RSFSR\\" for mass distribution in the USSR. After the death of Alexander Semionov in 1984, the painting Malaya Sadovaya Street was kept by the artist's widow, and in the early 1990s was sold into the private collection. Malaya Sadovaya Street was exhibited for the first time in 1987 at a posthumous exhibition of works by Alexander Semionov in the exhibition halls of the Leningrad Union of Artists.Alexander Mikhailovich Semionov.

It ended when anti-Gaddafi soldiers secured Zliten to the west and Tawergha to the south, establishing a significant buffer zone around the city. Background Following the Battle of Misrata in mid-May 2011, rebel forces retook the large parts of the city, which had been under pro-Gaddafi control, and established a defence line on Misrata's western outskirts at the small town of Dafniya, 35 kilometers from the centre of the city, and on the southwestern outskirts near Tawergha, which was still loyalist-held. What followed was more than a month of heavy frontline fighting and shelling. The aim of the rebels was to keep Misrata out of the artillery range of loyalist forces and to eventually make a breakthrough to the west toward the town of Zliten and then ultimately to the capital of Tripoli. Battle =Frontline fighting and stalemate= On 16 May, NATO warships chased away two inflatable boats near Misrata's port, one boat was left abandoned with explosives and mannequins on board. \\"They were there to look like people and draw ships in and the explosives could be detonated,\\" The boat was destroyed by gunfire. On 17 May, seven people were killed and 32 wounded, mostly rebels, during clashes between opposition and loyalist forces on the eastern and western edges of the city. The same day, Libyan state television claimed that Gaddafi's forces attacked a NATO warship off the coast of Misrata, this however was denied by NATO officials, stating that \\"It's a totally fabricated allegation\\". On 19 May, one rebel was killed and 10 were wounded by loyalist artillery fire in Dafniya, Zreig and Abu Rwea, on Misrata's western outskirts. On 23 May, two more people were killed and several wounded in fighting on the city's outskirts. During the fighting, a column of five loyalist tanks, accompanied by 50 infantry, advanced on rebel positions at Dafniya, on Misrata's western outskirts. During the advance, opposition forces were hit by heavy artillery shelling and rocket fire. The shelling also hit some of Misrata's neighbourhoods in the western and southern suburbs. On 26 May, three rebels were killed and 20 wounded by mortar fire on the frontlines near Misrata. On 27 May, Gaddafi's forces laid landmines in the Misrata area, according to the commander of the NATO mission. \\"This morning reports showed that a minefield was laid in the Misrata area,\\" Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard told a news conference. Also, rebels and loyalists engaged in fierce fighting for a second straight day on the western outskirts of the city in which five more rebels were killed and more than a dozen wounded.NATO says destroyed Gaddafi compound guard towers 1 On 28 May, rebels and loyalists fought at Tawergha, 40 kilometres south of Misrata, where rebels claimed to had captured a hospital which contained numerous weapons and tanks. Fighting also raged 25 kilometres east of Misrata. In all, 8-10 rebels were reported to have died in the fighting and 15-40 were wounded. Two loyalist soldiers were captured and an unknown number killed.NATO says destroyed Gaddafi compound guard towers 2 On 29 May, two rebels were killed and 28 wounded after loyalists attempted an attack against Dafniya. The rebels claimed to have killed several soldiers, captured a tank and repelled the attack.Britain readies \\"bunker-busting\\" bombs for Libya On 31 May, opposition forces attempted to advance from Dafniya toward loyalist lines but were pushed back in fighting that left one rebel dead and 29 wounded. On 1 June, a rebel spokesman from Zliten claimed that the Gaddafi regime was arming criminals in order to use them to crush an anti-Gaddafi rebellion in that city. The regime flatly denied these reports, labelling them unverified and \\"completely false\\". On 2 June, shelling at the frontline left one person dead and three wounded. On 3 June, more fighting killed one rebel and wounded two at the frontline. On 4 June, in fighting on both the western and eastern outskirts of Misrata, four rebels were killed and one wounded.Britain says rebels must plan for post- Gaddafi Libya On 6 June, loyalist forces pushed two kilometers into Dafniya, on the western side of Misrata, firing Grad rockets, before being pushed back by three kilometers. Two people were killed and 17 wounded during the fighting and the main station supplying electricity to Misrata had been hit leaving some areas of the city without power. At the same time, there was also fighting on the eastern side of the town. On 8 June, loyalist forces launched a massive offensive on Misrata, shelling the city from three sides and trying to enter the city. After the loyalist attack, the rebels attempted a counter- attack and they also advanced to the west, south and east. But their advance was stopped and they suffered heavy casualties. In total, 14 rebels were killed and 35 wounded. One rebel claimed that 70 loyalist soldiers were killed during the fighting, but no other source confirmed the claim. On 10 June, loyalist forces shelled Misrata and made a ground attack against opposition lines killing 31 rebels and wounding 160. Several loyalist soldiers were also killed and at least two tanks destroyed. A rebel spokesman stated that during the previous week of fighting 120 people had been killed at Misrata's fontline and 350 wounded, most of them rebels. Libya State TV reported that government forces shot down a NATO helicopter near Zliten. NATO denied this. At the same time, heavy fighting had reportedly broken out in Zliten, due to an uprising from rebels within the city. By 12 June, the rebel death toll from three days of shelling had reached nearly 40.Libyan Forces Shell Rebel Port City In West The same day, seven rebels fighters were killed and 49 wounded in the Dafniya district. The rebels also claimed to have captured 10 loyalist soldiers after an ambush. The Misrata refinery was damaged after six rockets hit its power generators. On 17 June, loyalists and rebels exchanged artillery fire killing ten rebels and one civilian. 39 opposition fighters and two children were wounded. Rebels fired rockets aiming for government tanks and ammo stockpiles in Naimah. The next day, 18 June, Gaddafi's forces withdrew from Naimah, with minimal fighting, prompting rebels to take the area. Al Jazeera correspondent Tony Birtley said the rebels were now aiming to take the village of Majer, southwest of Naimah, and southeast of Zliten. On 19 June, 10 rebels were killed and 54 wounded in shelling and an ambush conducted by Gaddafi forces,Libya says NATO airstrike kills 9 civilians who advanced one kilometer toward rebel lines, making the total casualties for just over a week at more than 40 dead and around 200 wounded. Reuters reporter Matt Robinson analyzed that the rebels small gains were made with heavy casualties due to their inexperience in battles in open areas. Rebels also admitted of doing tactical mistakes such as ruining surprise attacks. One rebel also complained that it was always the same units fighting on the frontline.

Also, a loyalist rocket attack on a residential area near Misrata's port killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded six of his relatives, including his mother and brother.NATO loses contact with drone chopper over Libya On 21 June, during another round of fighting, four rebels were killed and 60 wounded. Loyalist forces had managed to advance one kilometer which led to rebel mortar units falling back slightly. Four loyalist long-range rockets hit Misrata's city center, but there were no casualties. On 22 June, more loyalist artillery bombardment at the frontline killed four rebels and wounded 12. Earlier in the day, NATO air-strikes and ship shelling hit a loyalist military compound in Zliten, which was allegedly used for artillery attacks against rebel positions near Misrata. NATO stated that they destroyed 13 technicals, one armored personnel carrier and one mobile rocket launcher. In addition, a rebel spokesman claimed that over 200 loyalist soldiers were killed in the attack. However, there was no independent verification of the number of dead and previous rebel claims of loyalist death tolls were known to be inflated. The loyalists, for their part, claimed that dozens of people were killed. As of 24 June, information coming from the battlefield became almost non-existent, since rebels initiated a media clampdown on the press with the introduction of official minders, vetted translators and no more free trips to the frontline, citing setbacks on the front. On 26 June, an AP reporter from Misrata stated that one person was killed and seven wounded by two shells.Libya bombing campaign enters 100th day On 2 July, it was reported that shelling at Dafniya left 11 rebels wounded. On 3 July, two rebels were killed and 12 wounded during fighting on the frontline. On 4 July, six rebels were killed and 22 wounded in a loyalist ambush south of Misrata. The next day, another 11 rebels were killed and 42 others wounded in the heaviest artillery bombardment of rebel positions by Gaddafi's forces in weeks. On 6 July, 19 rebels were killed and 42 others wounded in fighting near Misrata, as well as 10 loyalist soldiers. Three civilians were also killed in loyalist rocket attacks. Among the rebels killed was Air Marshal Brigadier Ali Attalah Obeidi, who defected in April to the opposition forces.Libya rebels battle in plains south of Tripoli Earlier in the day, rebels said that they advanced 20 km toward the west but a Reuters reporter who later reached the new front line said the rebel positions had moved forward by seven kilometers.Libyan rebels push towards Tripoli on two fronts =Rebel advance on Suq Al Thulatha= On 8 July, after heavy fighting which continued since 6 July, the rebels claimed that they managed to capture the village Suq Al Thulatha on the outskirts of Zliten, about away from the city center. Seven rebels died and more than 30 were wounded in the fighting. Another 500 rebel fighters from other parts of rebel-held Libya also reinforced Misrata fighters the same day.Rebels advance to Tripoli, the UN is preparing to ease sanctions On 10 July, rebels encountered several minefields in Suq Al Thulatha, in which one rebel died and 32 were injured.Kadhafi forces counterattack southwest of Tripoli Rebels had also shelled the coastal road near Zliten, in the early hours, killing seven people. On 11 July, 11 rebels were killed and 25 wounded in more fighting in the area of Suq Al Thulatha after loyalist forces attempted to take a hill which had a strategic overlook of Misrata in the distance. They advance 300 meters before being pushed back. On 12 July, 19 rebels were killed and 22 wounded in heavy frontline shelling by loyalist forces. The next day, 13 July, more fighting left five rebels dead and 17 wounded. On 16 July, six rebels were killed and four wounded in fighting on the frontline. On 18 July, 23 rebel fighters were wounded during fighting in the region of Dafniya. On 20 July, seven rebels were killed and 13 wounded when they started a new offensive towards Zliten that they claimed had put them within 1.5 kilometers of the city. Three wounded loyalist soldiers were captured by the rebels during the fighting, of which one died later of his wounds. Rebel forces attempting to advance towards Zliten managed to capture General Abdul Nahib Zayid, who had been commanding pro-Gaddafi forces in Zliten and who had been heavily involved in the Battle of Misrata. Between 25 and 26 July, three rebels were killed and 11 others wounded in fighting on the frontline. On 27 July, four rebels were killed and 14 wounded in fighting west and south of Misrata. = Battle of Zliten = Rebels launched an offensive into Zliten on 21 July, but on 22 July, loyalists appeared to gain the upper hand, forcing them back into the outskirts of the city.Libya rebel casualties mount in battle for Zliten On 25 July, government forces destroyed a giant fuel tank in Misrata with Grad rockets causing most stations to close. On 30 July, loyalists launched a big attack on Dafniyah from its south with tanks and infantry, breaking through rebel lines and inflicting major casualties before being forced back.Libyan rebel commander killed by allied militia The rebel counteroffensive made it to Souk al Talak, west of Souk al Thulatha, before the anti-Gaddafi forces were pushed back to Souk al Thulatha. They reportedly mulled bypassing Zliten in favor of an offensive against Khoms, but they continued to advance toward Zliten. On 1 August, rebels said they had seized the city centre of Zliten, but fighting continued and the rebels reportedly had difficulty in securing the support of local tribes. Though the government claimed it had full control of Zliten on 3 August, journalists reported fighting continued in the city. On 2 August, Gaddafi forces attacked the rebels, reinforced by a brigade from Benghazi, in the farms north of Zliten, taking them by surprise and killing at least eight rebels and wounding 65. One of the opposition commanders leading the assault stated that earlier in the day rebels had made some gains on the eastern outskirts of Zliten, but following the loyalist counter-attack they were pushed back to their starting positions. On 3 August, the Libyan government said that they pushed back the rebels to Dafniyah after having beaten the rebels at the entrance to Zliten. The rebels denied these claims and stated that they had repelled the attempted offensive and had not retreated. Still, fighting appeared to be mostly centered in the eastern suburbs of the town, contradicting earlier rebel reports that they reached the city center. The rebel offensive in Zliten stalled by 7 August, and opposition forces were trying to hold on to positions in Suq Al Thulatha after their advance into Zliten was halted due to the loyalist counter-attack and a lack of ammunition. On 9 August, the Libyan government claimed that 85 civilians were killed in NATO airstrikes on Majer, a village near Zliten. A NATO spokesman said the sites struck were legitimate military targets and they had no evidence of civilian casualties. Reporters viewed at least 30 bodies, several of them the bodies of women and children. Rebels made a major push into Zliten on 19 August, and in the evening, Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons reported from Zliten that the city was under rebel control and people were celebrating in the streets. Loyalist forces reportedly retreated to Khoms. =Battle of Tawergha= On 11 August, six rebels were killed and 70 wounded as the rebels attempted to push toward Tawargha where they later that day claimed victory over loyalist forces. Fighting continued at Tawargha the next day with another three rebels being killed and another three opposition fighters were killed in clashes at Zliten. =End of the battle= On 13 August rebels claimed to have taken a bridge over the Sawfajjin valley which links Misrata and Sirte. On 13 August, a governmental spokesman claimed that loyalist forces had defeated an attempt by rebels to take the city of Bani Walid, southwest of Misrata. No other sources have reported on the claimed battle at Bani Walid. On 17 August, rebels stated that they had reached the outskirts of Al Hayshah, north of a major crossroads. Misrata radio reported that a column of rebel vehicles advanced southwards from Misrata, taking the town of Bir Durfan, and intended to capture the city of Bani Walid within days. On 23 August, the city of Khoms and the coastline towards Tripoli were captured by rebel forces.

It was released on September 5, 2009 by Telarc label. The album features eight original compositions plus two covers which are intended to musically describe Hiromi's travels around the world.

Uehara's next solo album Spectrum will be released only 10 years later, in October 2019. Reception Jeff Winbush of All About Jazz stated \\"By its nature, solo piano has a degree of self- interest, but Hiromi is never a narcissist. She thoroughly enjoys what she does and at no time does the recording come off as a vanity project by a self- centered egotist. Place To Be is an exciting and brilliant romp through the life, time, and travels of Hiromi, one of the most consistently innovative and impressive artists in jazz today.\\" Steve Greenlee of JazzTimes commented \\"She has a deep affinity for the blues and loves the lower end of the register but isn‚Äôt afraid to throw in some dissonant non-chords either... It‚Äôs sheer delight, then, to hear Place to Be, a collection of 12 solos that run the gamut.\\" Alex Henderson of AllMusic added \\"As it turns out, playing unaccompanied is perfect for Hiromi; the acoustic solo-piano format gives her plenty of room to explore her creative impulses. Hiromi can be quite self- indulgent at times, but she is never self-indulgent in a bad way -- and the lack of accompaniment yields excellent results for her on Place to Be.\\" Track listing All tracks written and composed by Hiromi Uehara, except \\"Berne, Baby, Berne!\\" (written and composed by Louie Bellson and Remo Palmier), and \\"Pachelbel's Canon\\" (written and composed by Johann Pachelbel). # BQE (5:57) # Choux √† la Cr√®me (5:30) # Sicilian Blue (8:27) # Berne, Baby, Berne!

Although frequently dated as 1424, most historians believe it was probably composed a half century later. The author is unknown, although said to be a member of the Freducci family of cartographers of Ancona, most probably Conte di Ottomano Freducci. Faint and fragile, the Weimar map is rarely photographed and has been hard to decipher.  Date and author  The exact date and author of the map is contentious. The faint legend has been read (narrowly) as \\"Contes..........conposuit ancone anno d√±i mcccc...\\".Winter, 1938: p.151 One of the first to examine it, Alexander von Humboldt, tentatively dated the map as early as 1424.Alexander von Humboldt (Examen critique, Vol. 2, pp.180-86). However, in subsequent correspondence with the Weimar librarian, Humboldt revised his estimation of the date as late as 1481 or 1491, on account of it containing features that were probably copied from later portolans.Babcock (1917: p.478) A later examination by Walter Ruge (1904) read the legend more expansively as \\"Contes he........conposuit ancone anno d√±i mcccclx...\\",Ruge, 1904:p.3. with the significant addition of the LX to the date bringing it forward a half century (in Ruge's estimation to the 1470s). Ruge also contended that the \\"he\\" and the large space after it is enough to fit hectomanni Fredutijs, thereby proposing its author was the cartographer Conte di Ottomano Freducci of Ancona (fl. 1497-1539), author of the 1497 Wolfenb√ºttel map.Ruge(1904: p.4) However, Heinrich Winter (1938), one of the few scholars to have had direct access to the fragile map, believes Humboldt's original 1424 date has merit and casts doubt on Ruge's identification of its author, although reserving the possibility that it might have been made by another member of the Freducci family.Winter (1938: p.152). Caraci (1953: p.24), in his review of the Freducci family, is unable to identify whom it might be, and sets the Weimar map aside as indeterminate. In his review, Cortes√£o sides with Ruge and suggests the date of composition was sometime between 1460 and 1469, either by Conte di Ottomano or one of his relatives.Cortes√£o (p.109) More recently, Astengo also says the attribution to Conte di Ottomano \\"seems reasonable\\" and that the dating can be anywhere between 1460 and 1499.Astengo (2007: 220-21)  Features  The Weimar map is a typical 15th-century Italian portolan chart (Mediterranean and Black Seas) that also covers the Atlantic to the Baltic sea. W.H. Babcock, 1917) The islands of the Madeira archipelago are depicted and inscribed as INsule fortunate sancti brandani (the mythical islands of Saint Brendan).Babcock (1917: p.478) notes that if this was done in 1424, it would probably have been spelled \\"Insulle\\" rather than \\"Insule\\". Islands that seem like the Azores are depicted and named as (corvi) marini, I conilli, San gior(gio), Isola de uentura, colonbi, Isole de bra.ill, chapraria and louo.Winter (1938: p.151) It is notable that bra.il, presumed to be the mythical Brasil island, is located in this central Atlantic cluster, and not (as is usual in early maps) west of Ireland. On the extreme left, partially cut off by the narrow neck of the map, is the legendary large Antillia island.Babcock (1917: p.478); Winter (1938). Although its lower part is severed, the label Antilia is clear; there are also indications of cities whose faint letters are evocative of Grazioso Benincasa's maps.,Babcock, 1917: p.478 and a small legend which has been variously read as \\"Sebil\\" or, more probably, \\"Septa\\" (for the Seven Cities).,Winter, 1938 Of its companion islands, Satanazes is shown in full (spelled Salvagio here), and there also seems to be a tiny fragment of Royllo and traces of a legend for Tanmar.Winter, 1938 If the Weimar map were truly made in 1424, then it would be the first map to depict Antillia cartographically (or at least place it on an equal footing with the 1424 nautical map of Zuane Pizzigano).

It is a Be star, rotating rapidly, and at times surrounded by a disk of expelled material. This qualifies it as a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable, and the visual range is magnitude 6 - 7. In 1989 and 1990, the spectrum of X Persei changed from a Be star to a normal B class star while it faded significantly. This appears to have been caused by the loss of the accretion disk. The disk has since reformed and shows strong emission lines. The system also contains a neutron star which is a pulsar with an unusually long period of 837 seconds. The pulsar has shown period changes that are associated with mass transfer from the more massive primary star. Between 1973 and 1979 it was seen to increase its rate of spin, associated with a strong x-ray flare and presumed strong mass transfer. Since then the spin has been slowing despite small x-ray flares. The combination of a neutron star and OB emission line star places X Persei in the Be/X-ray binary class of stars. There is a faint optical companion separated by 22.5\\" which the Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars refers to as X Persei B. It is a background red giant and a candidate long period variable with the variable star designation V397 Persei.

Biography =Early life and education= Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Bartchak is the 5th of eight children. He attended Catholic elementary and secondary schools, graduating in 1973 from Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, Pennsylvania, in the Diocese of Erie. His college studies were at St. Mark Seminary and Gannon University, Erie, PA, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy in 1977. He also studied for the priesthood at Christ the King Seminary, East Aurora, NY, receiving a Master of Arts degree in Theology in 1981. He studied canon law at The Catholic University of America School of Canon Law in Washington, DC where he received the Licentiate degree in 1989 and the Doctorate degree in 1992. =Ordination and ministry= Bartchak was ordained a deacon at Christ the King Seminary on September 22, 1980, and served as deacon at St. Joseph Parish, Warren, Pennsylvania. He was ordained a priest for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania on May 15, 1981, by the late Bishop Michael J. Murphy at St. Peter Cathedral, Erie. Immediately after ordination to the priesthood, Bishop Bartchak was assigned as temporary parochial vicar at St. Joseph Parish, Warren, Pennsylvania. In August 1981, he was assigned as parochial vicar at St. Francis Parish, Clearfield, Pennsylvania. He was also assistant principal and theology teacher at St. Francis High School and part- time chaplain at the Clearfield Hospital. He was transferred to St. Leo Magnus Parish, Ridgway, Pennsylvania, to serve as administrator of the parish for several months when the pastor became ill. He was then appointed parochial vicar at St. Leo Magnus Parish. His duties included pastoral care at the Elk County General Hospital and the Elk County Prison. In these early parish assignments he was active in local ecumenical clergy associations. He was a speaker at ecumenical and civic gatherings. In 1982 Bartchak was appointed part-time Defender of the Bond, and in 1986 he was assigned full-time to the Tribunal of the Diocese of Erie. During his time in Washington, Bartchak assisted as a confessor at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. In August, 1991, Bartchak was assigned to reside at St. Stanislaus Parish in Erie and provide weekend assistance. In 1992 Bartchak was appointed by Bishop Donald Trautman as Judicial Vicar and Director of the Office of Conciliation & Arbitration of the Diocese of Erie. In 2000 he received papal honours from Pope John Paul II with the title of Chaplain to His Holiness. In addition to these duties, he was named Vicar for Canonical Affairs of the Diocese of Erie in 2004.

In 2007 he was appointed as a consultant for the USCCB Committee on Canonical Affairs and Church Governance. Handling of sexual abuse in Erie Diocese In a grand jury report published by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro on August 14, 2018, Bartchak was criticized for his handling of a 2005 investigation against former Erie priest William Presley. Bartchak was assigned by the Vatican during this time to investigate claims against Presley, who served in the Erie Diocese between 1963 and 1986, and he re-interviewed a male victim who previously disclosed his alleged abuse to the diocese in 1982, 1987 and 2002. On Aug. 25, 2005, Bartchak sent a secret memo to then-Erie Bishop Donald Trautman. Parts of the memo read \\"I was not surprised to learn from other witnesses from the Elk County area that there are likely to be other victims\\" and that \\"it is likely that there may be others who were also of the age for the offenses to be considered delicts, but to what end is it necessary to follow every lead?\\" Trautman demised that it was \\"not likely that they will lead to information concerning delicts involving minors under 16 years of age,\\" Bartchak wrote. =Bishop of Altoona-Johnstown= On January 14, 2011, Bartchak was appointed bishop of the Altoona-Johnstown Diocese and was consecrated bishop on April 19, 2011.Bishop Mark Leonard Bartchak See also * Catholic Church hierarchy * Catholic Church in the United States * Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States * List of Catholic bishops of the United States * Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops References  External links  *Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown Home Page *HISTORY OF SAINT STANISLAUS CATHOLIC CHURCH ERIE, PA Episcopal succession Category:Religious leaders from Cleveland Category:American Roman Catholic bishops Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Catholic University of America School of Canon Law alumni Category:21st-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Mark Bartchak"},{"id":"32052705","text":"Sir Patrick Walsh (fl. 1580 ‚Äì c.1610) was an Irish ambassador and friar. Patrick Walsh was a knight and wealthy merchant in the city of Waterford, becoming Mayor of Waterford in 1578. He was an older half-brother of Thomas Walsh, Archbishop of Cashel 1626‚Äì54. Another brother, Richard Walsh, was a Jesuit. (1992, n. 28, p. 191). Biography It was in his capacity as Mayor that Walsh first came to notice, acting as a ‚Äúrepresentative from the ‚Äò‚ÄôUrbs Intacta‚Äô‚Äô to Queen Elizabeth‚Äù. Marmaduke Middleton, Protestant Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, wrote of Walsh in a letter to Sir Francis Walsingham dated 29 June 1580, describing the citizens of Waterford as ‚Äústiffnecked, stubborn, papistical and incorrigible‚Äô‚Äô. He attributed their stance to Walsh, saying of him: ‚Äò‚Äôthe greatest support of this is he, which was the last year mayor, whose name is Sir Patrick Walsh, a counterfeit Christian, and a great enemy of God‚Äôs truth. And [he] is coming over to obtain something of her Majesty to maintain his knighthood withal ... Wherein I dare be bold to say, no man exceedeth the said Sir Patrick, with whom, the living God knoweth, the whole city are partakers.‚Äô‚Äô (State papers concerning the Irish Church in the time of Queen Elizabeth, p. 41, W. M. Brady, ed. (and 1992, p. 10) Walsh was married. However, he and his wife entered into a pact that upon the death of one of them, the survivor could enter a religious order. In 1598, after the death of his wife, Walsh sailed to France, joining the Capuchin order at Paris, where he died about 1610. Yet even up to the time of his death his advice was regularly sought by citizens of Waterford on municipal matters, such was his esteem in the town. F. X. Martin writes ‚ÄúThough it is probable that Walsh knew Francis Lavalin Nugent at Paris he did not join the Irish mission. Like Patrick Bath he died before it became a reality in 1615 with the acquisition of a friary at Charleville in northern France as headquarters for the Irish Capuchins.‚Äù *‚ÄôSo Manie in the Verie Prime and Spring of their Youth, Manie of them Heirs of Lande‚Äô: The Friars of the Irish Capuchin Mission in Northern France and the Low Countries, 1591‚Äì1641‚Äù, p. 10, F.

River River Thames from Caversham Bridge The town grew up as a river port at the confluence of the Thames and Kennet. Both of these rivers are navigable, and the locks of Caversham Lock, Blake's Lock, County Lock, Fobney Lock and Southcote Lock are all within the borough. Today navigation is exclusively leisure oriented, with private and hire boats dominating traffic. Scheduled boat services operate on the Thames, operating from wharves on the Reading side of the river near Caversham Bridge. Salters Steamers operate a summer daily service from just downstream of the bridge to Henley-on-Thames, taking around two hours in each direction and calling at the riverside villages of Sonning and Shiplake. Thames River Cruises operate trips from just upstream of the bridge, including a service on summer weekends and bank holidays to Mapledurham, taking 45 minutes in each direction and allowing two hours ashore for visits to Mapledurham Watermill and Mapledurham House. Road Looking west from Junction 11 of the M4 motorway near Green Park Business Park Reading was a major staging point on the old Bath Road (A4) from London to Bath and Bristol. This road still carries local traffic, but has now been replaced for long distance traffic by the M4 motorway, which closely skirts the borough and serves it with three junctions (J10-J12). Other main roads serving Reading include the A33 from Basingstoke, the A327 from Farnborough, the A329 from Bracknell to Thame, the A4074 to Oxford, and the A4155 to Henley-on-Thames. Within Reading there is the Inner Distribution Road (IDR), a ring road for local traffic movements. The A329(M), A33 and A4 national routes link the town with junctions 10, 11 and 12 of the M4 motorway respectively. The IDR is linked with the M4 by the A33 relief road, which runs past the Madejski Stadium and Green Park Business complex. National Express Coaches run out of Mereoak park and Ride, at Junction 11 of the M4. The Thames is crossed by both Reading and Caversham road bridges, while several road bridges cross the Kennet. There is a long-running debate about constructing a third bridge across the Thames, to the east of the existing bridges. Some people believe that this will remove one of the town's bottlenecks and ease traffic congestion. Others believe that it will induce more traffic, move bottle necks and open up swathes of South Oxfordshire to unwanted development. However, the proximity of the county border means that any such route will have to pass through South Oxfordshire, and this development has so far been blocked by its residents and politicians. Rail  Reading station. The original GWR building is now a pub called The Three Guineas Reading is a major junction point on the National Rail system, and as a consequence Reading station is a major transfer point as well as serving heavy originating and terminating traffic. Plans have been agreed to rebuild Reading station, with grade separation of some conflicting traffic flows and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. The route to Paddington offers both non-stop (taking around 30 minutes) and stopping services, whilst that to Waterloo offers only a stopping service, however this service does give Reading direct links with Richmond and Clapham Junction. Inter-city services also link Reading to , Bristol, Cardiff, , Exeter, , Birmingham and the North of England as well as and . Local services link Reading to , , , , and . Other stations in the Reading area are Reading West, Tilehurst and Earley, but all serve local trains only. Green Park railway station is planned on the Reading to Basingstoke Line to serve Green Park Business Park. Reading will serve as the western terminus of Crossrail, with services running to London, Shenfield and Abbey Wood. Since December 2019, passengers are able to use contactless payments between Reading and London Paddington. Air RailAir coaches on the service to London Heathrow Airport outside Reading station There have been two airfields in Reading, one at Coley Park and one at Woodley, but these have both closed. Today Reading is within reach of several international airports. The nearest airport is London Heathrow, which is away by road. An express bus service named RailAir links Reading with Heathrow, or the airport can be accessed by changing at Hayes and Harlington railway station from the local rail service to Paddington to the Heathrow Connect rail service. London Gatwick is away by road and is served by direct trains from Reading. London Luton is also away by road, whilst London Stansted is away; both can be reached by rail by changing stations in central London. The airport at London City can also be reached by a combination of rail services. Away from London, Southampton Airport and Birmingham Airport are both served by direct trains from Reading and can be faster to reach than the more distant of the London airports. Southampton is away by road, whilst Birmingham is distant. Public transport Horse tram in Broad Street, c. 1900 The first local public transport started in 1878 with the Reading Tramways Company then (part of the Imperial Tramways Company) operating a horse tram route on an east-west alignment from Oxford Road through Broad Street in the town centre to Cemetery Junction. Significantly, this route formed the core of what became known as the main line of the network. The new electric trams started operating in July 1903. Extensions were constructed to the Wokingham Road and London Road (both from Cemetery Junction), and new routes added to Whitley, Caversham Road, Erleigh Road and Bath Road. The trams operated from a new depot in Mill Lane, a site that was to remain Reading Buses' main depot until it was demolished to make way for The Oracle shopping mall in 1998. The first trolleybus wiring erected was a training loop on Erleigh Road, which opened in early 1936. During World War II a trolleybus branch was constructed from the Oxford Road to Kentwood Hill, enabling trolleybuses to replace motor buses with a consequential saving in precious oil based fuel. Reading Corporation decided to abandon the trolleybus system, and the routes were phased out between January 1967 and November 1968. Today local public transport is largely road- based, and can be affected by peak hour congestion in the borough. A frequent local bus network within the borough, and a less frequent network in the surrounding area, is provided by Reading Buses. Other bus operators include First, Arriva South East and Thames Travel. ReadiBus provides an on-demand transport service for people with restricted mobility in the area. Since 2004, Reading Transport and Reading Borough Council have made a significant investment in upgrading the quality of Reading's main urban bus routes. In late 2007, Reading Buses placed an order with Scania for 14 new ethanol fuelled double decker buses to replace the existing fleet of biodiesel powered vehicles operating premier route 17. At the time the order was placed, this was the largest order for ethanol fuelled buses in the UK. These buses started work on 26 May 2008. Cycling The OYBike bicycle sharing system operates in Reading, with approximately 15 bicycles with docking stations at Reading station, Holiday Inn (Basingstoke Road) and Green Park. In March 2011 Reading Borough Council approved a larger scheme similar to the Barclays Cycle Hire in London, with 1,000 bicycles available at up to 150 docking stations across Reading.

Lo√´ had the distinction of being one of the few Roman Catholics to reach the rank of Generalfeldmarschall, or field marshal.  Early life and military career  Lo√´ was born into the Westphalian aristocracy on September 9, 1828 in Schloss Allner, in Hennef. His wealthy Catholic family held a baronial title, and his father sent him to be educated at the Ritterakademie in Bedburg. In 1845, Lo√´ served his required year in the military, allowing him to enter the reserves. After graduating from the academy, he studied at Bonn University. Lo√´ was not to stay at the university for long, however, as war with Denmark broke out over a border dispute known as the Schleswig-Holstein Question. The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, located along the Danish border, were claimed by both Prussia and Denmark. When German Schleswig-Holsteiners rebelled, Prussia and other German states sent forces to intervene. Lo√´ served as a lieutenant of German cavalry during the conflict, eventually transferring to the Prussian Third Hussars. In 1851, the war with Denmark concluded with an agreement, the 1852 London Protocol, which allowed the Danes to retain Schleswig-Holstein. Lo√´ remained in the military, however, fighting rebels in Baden before becoming adjutant of Prussia's Army Riding School. A major by 1861, Lo√´ became an aide to William I of Prussia, serving in this capacity for one year, upon which he accompanied the King's brother Albert to the Caucasus. In 1863, Lo√´ was appointed military attach√© to the French army in Algeria. While in North Africa, he participated in a French campaign against Arab rebels. Returning to Prussia, Lo√´ was promoted, first to lieutenant colonel (1867) and then to full colonel (1868), and commanded the Seventh Hussars during the Franco-Prussian War, after which Germany was united under King William, now Emperor of the entire German nation. Lo√´'s forces performed satisfactorily during the war, and he advanced to the level of brigade commander. Serving in both command and staff roles, Lo√´ (now Baron Lo√´ after succeeding to his father's title) rose to major general and then to lieutenant general. He became the commander of the 5th Division in 1879. From 1880 to 1884, Lo√´ was the Prussian adjutant general. After leaving this position in 1884, he was given command of the VIII Army Corps. In 1893, Lo√´ was sent to Rome in a diplomatic capacity. While in the Italian city, he met with Pope Leo XIII. Upon successful completion of this mission, Lo√´ was made Colonel General of the Cavalry. After spending two years in charge of the cavalry branch, he was promoted to field marshal, becoming one of the few Catholics to receive this highest rank after service in the Protestant-dominated Prussian army. Lo√´ was given the position of Governor of Berlin along with his new rank. In 1897, the ailing field marshal submitted his resignation, although he accepted a diplomatic mission in 1900. He died on July 6, 1908 in the city of Bonn.  Personal life  In 1859, Lo√´ married Countess Franziska von Hatzfeldt zu Trachenberg, who had three children of her own from a previous marriage. The couple had three children of their own: Helen and twins Margaret and Hubert. Lo√´'s brother was Otto von Lo√´, a legislator. Lo√´ was given an honorary doctorate by the Rheinische Friedrich- Wilhelms University in 1907.  Catholic faith  Lo√´'s promotion to field marshal was exceptional in that this honor was rarely given to Catholics. Traditionally a Protestant state, Prussia allowed few Catholics to rise that high in rank. Although a believer in Catholicism, Lo√´ supported practices such as dueling, often embracing the traditions of Prussian Protestant officers.

Beer production commenced in 1936, and Ewo Breweries became a public company under Jardines' management in 1940 with Chinese investors buying up 75% of the stock. The brewery, built in the Yangpu District then on the Eastern outskirts of Shanghai, was commandeered by the Japanese at the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) but passed unscathed through the conflict despite its location at the centre of hostilities. Pilsner and Munich types of beers were produced, both being considered suitable to the Far Eastern climate. Following the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, new government regulations were introduced the following year which increased taxes, restricted currency exchanges and banned redundancies. The brewery was forced to reduce its prices by 17 per cent and lost $4 million annually. p.60 Online version at Google Books. In March 1952, the British consul-general in Shanghai reported that EWO Brewery chairman Robin Gordon had been arrested by the Chinese authorities. p. 136 Gordon was brought before a People's Court and accused of failing to pay the wages of 240 workers. He was eventually released from prison on 20 March. Jardines withdrew from China in 1954, selling the brewery at a loss.

This astrapothere differs from its coeval, the uruguaytheriine astrapotheriid Xenastrapotherium by their larger size, between 2.5 and 3.5 tonnes, with tusks about one meter long, making it one of the largest representatives of Astrapotheria, only surpassed by some species of Parastrapotherium. Other differences include the presence of only one premolar, the lack of incisors in both jaws and the disposition of the canine tooth, which are very large and horizontal, which reminds much less of those of hippos and more of the tusks of some ancient relatives of elephants (such as Palaeomastodon), although the defences in elephants and their relatives are not formed by the canines but the incisors. Similarly, the large nostrils appear extremely withdrawn on the skull, so this creature had to have a larger trunk than other astrapotheres. Most likely, like elephants, this animal used its muscular proboscis together with its tusks to cut leaves off trees and shrubs.Johnson, Steven C. & Madden, Richard H. 1997.

The oldest remaining pieces in the late 19th century bore only the words \\"Darby\\" and \\"Darbishire\\" and the years 1751-2-3 as proof of place and year of manufacture. More important is the fact that the production of porcelain in Derby predates the commencement of the works of William Duesbury, started in 1756 when he joined Andrew Planche and John Heath to create the Nottingham Road factory, which later became the Royal Crown Derby.„ÄÇ  History  Site of Woodward's pipe kiln, where Andr√© Planch√® fired his birds, cats, dogs, and sheep. 85-piece porcelain dinner service crafted by Derby and Duesbury for the 8th Duke of Hamilton, circa 1780-90 Figure of Britannia made around 1780. It is known by William Duesbury's own notes, that Derby had a solid production of exceptional quality porcelain in early 1750s. The proof of the quality of locally produced material is evidenced by the fact that Duesbury, then a known enameller in London, have paid considerably more for pieces manufactured in Derby than for figurines made by rival factories in Bow and Chelsea. It was common at the time that dealers purchased white glazed porcelain from various manufacturers, and send it to enamelists like Duesbury to do the final finishing (enamelling and colouring). The first printed mention about the Derby factory, however, dates only from December 1756, when an advertisement in the Public Advertiser, republished several times throughout the month, urged readers to participate in a sale by auction in London, sponsored by the Derby Porcelain Manufactory. Curiously, there are no other references to this supposed Derby Porcelain Manufactory, which suggests that the name was specifically invented for the occasion. Although it can be seen only as boasting, the advertisement calls the factory a \\"second Dresden\\", showing the good quality of their products. Of course, such perfection represented the culmination of a lengthy manufacturing process, and nothing in this announcement indicates that this annual sales had been the first of the factory, unlike what would occur with similar advertisements from manufacturers of Bow and Longton Hall in 1757. The potter Andrew Planche is often cited as a forerunner of the Derby china factory. Reports about a \\"foreigner in very poor circumstances\\" who lived in Lodge Lane and produced small porcelain figures around 1745, may refer to Planch√®. However, as pointed out by a researcher, in 1745 Planch√® was only 17 years old. The very importance of Planch√® to the constitution of the future Royal Crown Derby was minimized by some (as the granddaughter of William Duesbury, Sarah Duesbury, who died in 1876), and contested by others, who doubt his existence. However, there is evidence that Planch√® was really a historical figure, although he certainly has not taught the craft of enamelling to William Duesbury. A serious contender for the title of maker of the porcelain pieces of the second Dresden is the Cockpit Hill Potworks. Historians deduce that this \\"Derby Pot Works\\" was already in full operation around 1708, on behalf of a slipware tyg, containing the inscription John Meir made this cup 1708. It is known that the Pot Works produced china, due to the announcement of an auction held in 1780, when the company went bankrupt. No mention is made of enamelled figures, but it is quite likely that they were also built, at a time when demand for these items was high. Or, perhaps, this branch of the works has been fully assimilated by the Duesbury's factory from the second half of 1750s on. Because of an arrest warrant drawn up in 1758 against a certain John Lovegrove, we know that the owners of the Cockpit Hill Potworks were William Butts, Thomas Rivett and John Heath. Heath was the banker who later would finance the construction of the Nottingham Road factory, and Rivett was Member of Parliament and Mayor of Derby in 1761, where one finds that Potworks' partners were wealthy and influential men in local society. However, competition with the Nottingham Road factory seems to have been fatal. Already in 1772, the quality of Potworks' production had fallen to the point where a visitor does classify it as ¬´imitation of the Queen's ware, but it does not come up to the original, the produce of Staffordshire.¬ª In 1785, the factory closed its doors permanently.

The name Pintorp origins from Ericsberg Castle, which was originally called Pinntorpa. The legend as social criticism Sweden was at war during most of the 17th century. This meant that many men were absent serving in warfare abroad, and the responsibility of their estates in Sweden fell upon their wives who were left behind at home. Because of gender roles expecting a different behavior from a female, female landowners were regarded to be more cruel than males when taking the role of the manager of an estate. Tales of former landowners haunting their estates after death out of remorse for their repression therefore became a way of tenants to indirectly criticize their own living landowners. The folk tale According to an old folk-tale from the 17th-century, Pintorpafrun starved her workers and whipped them when they could not met up to her demand and imprisoned them in her private dungeons. As punishment for this, she was one day called upon by Satan, who danced her to death in a walz and thereafter dragged her down to hell. Song Many songs were made about Pintorpafrun, inspired by the old tale. The perhaps most known one was a song named Pintorpa-frun, which were written by the poet Wilhelm von Braun and widely spread by Broadside (music) during the 19th century. Potential Ladies of Pintorp Many different female landowners during the 16th-and 17th-century has been pointed out as the role model behind the legend of Pintorpafrun. The most known ones are as follows: =Anna Karlsdotter (d. 1552)= Anna was the maternal grandmother of queen Margaret Leijonhufvud. As a widow, she managed the estate Pintorp from 1508 to 1552. She is described as willful and powerful, but no sources point her out as cruel. =Beata von Yxkull (1618‚Äì1667)= Beata von Yxkull married the owner of Pintorp in 1636, and managed the estate during the absence of her spouse and after his death in 1657. In popular legend, she is the one most frequently mentioned as Pintorpafrun, but in reality, she is not considered to be a likely role model. No contemporary sources describes her as cruel. =Anna Oxenstierna (1585-1656)= Anna Oxenstierna was pointed out as Pintorpafrun in the famous song by Wilhelm von Braun, but in fact, she had no connection to the Pintorp estate. =Barbro P√•le (d. 1553)= Barbro P√•le, or Barbro Eriksdotter (Bielke), married the owner of Brokind manor in 1524, and managed the estate during the absence of her spouse. Though not a manager of Pintorp, the legend of her are in many ways similar to that of Beata von Yxkull and Pintorpafrun, and she has been referred to as the Pintorpafrun p√• Brokind (The Pintorpafrun of Brokind).

He is best known for his work on the Batman franchise at DC Comics and the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers franchise at Boom! Studios. Early life Kyle Higgins was born June 12, 1985, and grew up in Homer Glen, Illinois. At the age of seven Higgins saw the 1978 feature film Superman, which began his passion for both comic books and filmmaking.\\"Filmmakers\\". theleaguefilm.com. Retrieved June 23, 2014. After two years of studying film and creative writing at the University of Iowa, Higgins transferred to the Film Production program of Chapman University in Orange, California, from which he would graduate. In late 2006, he began an unpaid internship with The Donners' Company, which provided him with the opportunity to work with Richard Donner, who directed the film that introduced Higgins to comics and filmmaking. Career After writing and directing his college thesis film titled The League, about the superhero labor union of 1960's Chicago, Higgins spent a year writing for Marvel Comics before authoring the back-up features for the 2010 editions of Detective Comics Annual and Batman Annual. The stories introduced the Franco-Islamic character Nightrunner, who he co-created with David Hine and caused some controversy. Higgins stayed on the Batman brand, co-writing the five-issue Batman: Gates of Gotham with Detective Comics scribe Scott Snyder which delved into the history of Gotham City. When DC rebooted their entire line in 2011 with The New 52, Higgins wrote Nightwing, often interlinking arcs with Snyder, who moved to Batman. Higgins also wrote the first eight issues of Deathstroke in September 2011.Vaneta Rogers (June 23, 2011). \\"HIGGINS: DCnU DEATHSTROKE Will Be a BADASS Again\\". Newsarama. Higgins began writing Batman Beyond 2.0, a DCU version of the character from the DCAU animated series Batman Beyond, for DC's digital-first line. In January 2014, it was announced that Higgins had joined the writing team for Batman Eternal following his work on Nightwing, which ended in March 2014. In January 2014, Higgins announced C.O.W.L., his first creator-owned ongoing series with Image Comics. The series, co-written by Alec Siegel and featuring art by Rod Reis, revisited the world created by Higgins in The League. C.O.W.L. explored superheroes from the lens of union organization, and featured an early-1960s aesthetic, noir overtones, and political drama. The series debuted in May 2014 and its first issue sold out of its initial print run. The series concluded in July 2015, with issue 11. Announced at Image Expo 2015, their next collaboration was the eight-issue sci-fi murder mystery Hadrian's Wall, which debuted in September 2016, which he will direct the film adaptation for the sci-fi label Dust. In late 2015, Higgins was announced as the writer of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, an ongoing comic based on the show of the same name. Issue 9 of the comic introduced \\"the first new official Mighty Morphin Power Ranger created in over 20 years\\", Lord Drakkon. The character's popularity soon led to inclusion in mobile fighting game Power Rangers: Legacy Wars, an exclusive action figure, and other merchandise. Beginning in March 2018, Higgins wrote the first Power Rangers comic book event in \\"Shattered Grid\\", incorporating a range of characters from across the show's history, to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary. Higgins later wrote the story for the video game Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid, also acting as the game's voice director and providing the voice of the Mastadon Sentry. Higgins' next short film, The Shadow Hours, premiered in August 2016. Starring Tom Riley and Britt Lower, the award-winning neo-noir follows twin private investigators born with a mysterious medical condition where only one of them can be awake at a time. In March 2017, Dynamite Entertainment announced a reboot of the Magnus, Robot Fighter franchise, written by Higgins with art by Jorge Forn√©s. Although released to strong reviews, the series was ultimately cancelled at issue 5. Higgins also reunited with his Gates of Gotham collaborator Trevor McCarthy for Nightwing: The New Order, an Elseworlds-style miniseries set in an alternate universe in which superpowers have been eliminated and outlawed. Despite initial fan criticism of the premise, the series was ultimately well-received, with many reviewers comparing the book positively to Marvel's concurrent Secret Empire event. In early 2018, Higgins announced The Dead Hand, a creator-owned series for Image Comics with art by Stephen Mooney. A spy comic about a Cold War secret that returns to threaten the world, the series is set to debut in April 2018. In March 2020, It was announced that Higgins and Mat Groom would be writing a new Ultraman ongoing series, titled The Rise of Ultraman, with art by Michael Cho, Francesco Manna.

Born Alison Bools in Dublin to an English mother and Irish father, raised in Dalkey and educated at Holy Child Killiney. Biography =Childhood= O'Donnell grew up in Dalkey and Killiney in south County Dublin, where she had a daily view of Dalkey Island (which was to provide inspiration for song writing in her teens and early 20s). Ballet and sporting activities were early interests until the age of 11 when music became her abiding passion. Her commitment was sealed when she took Cecilia as her Confirmation name (Saint Cecilia being the Patron saint of musicians). At the age of 11 she co-founded the progressive folk rock band Mellow Candle with school friends Clodagh Simonds and Maria White.Seasons They Change: The Story of Acid and Psychedelic Folk Jeanette Leech (Jawbone, 2010). (Chapter about Mellow Candle) They released their first single, Feeling High on SNB Records (Simon Napier-Bell) in 1968. =Early career= On leaving school, O'Donnell attended Art College in D√∫n Laoghaire (now D√∫n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology) and briefly joined Blue Tint, a covers band, where she met her first husband, guitarist Dave Williams, who was studying at Trinity College, Dublin. This was followed by a secretarial course and employment until a full electric line-up of Mellow Candle reformed. The band lived and worked in Ireland and England between 1969 and 1973 managed by Thin Lizzy manager, Ted Carroll. O'Donnell and Williams spent their wedding evening in concert with Thin Lizzy at the National Stadium in Dublin. Bob Geldof, Luke Kelly and members of Clannad were amongst early spectators at Irish concerts, and several members of the group participated in house sessions with pioneering traditional musicians, D√≥nal Lunny and Andy Irvine. The band released their latterly highly acclaimed, cult album, Swaddling Songs on Decca Records's Deram subsidiary in 1972. The untimely and unhappy demise of Mellow CandleIrish Folk, Trad and Blues: A Secret History, Colin Harper & Trevor Hodgett, 2005.Seasons They Change (The Story of Acid and Psychedelic Folk) Jeanette Leech, 2010 and the tough economic climate of the Three-Day Week in 1973/74 London sent O'Donnell and Williams to Johannesburg, South Africa. Simonds and Murray ultimately went to New York, and Boylan joined The Gary Moore Band for a time. In the year before their departure they played Belgian bars as a folk duo and formed a short-lived band with legendary guitarist Jimmy Faulkner, who died in 2008. Disenchanted by hard drug use backstage, they abandoned the project. Two years after their arrival in South Africa the couple participated in Palet, an Afrikaans music and poetry programme in 1976 for the fledgling South African Broadcasting Corporation's television service. The show was considered too radical and highbrow, and never aired, resulting in the producer's resignation. They formed traditional group Flibbertigibbet in 1977 with Barrie Glenn and Jo Dudding whom they met at Mangles Folk Club. The band recorded their vinyl album, Whistling Jigs to the Moon in 1978 in South Africa for a slim, niche market, and made several appearances on SATV. The recording was more fully appreciated and reissued in 1996. After the break-up of Flibbertigibbet in 1979 O'Donnell worked as a session singer for singer-songwriters and advertising agency recordings, toured in the musical I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It on the Road produced by Des and Dawn Lindberg, and performed in a series of satirical revues in 1980/81 with South African actors and musicians: Tortue Revues I and II in Rockey Street's famed 80s clubs, and Fool Marks and Commit No Nuisance at the Chelsea Hotel Hillbrow with music by David Marks (songwriter, producer and archivist), who had earlier given Flibbertigibbet their first run at The Market Theatre in Johannesburg. In the early to mid-80s O'Donnell appeared briefly with jazz group Theta and an early incarnation of the popular rock group Ella Mental at Sun City. She recorded an album with writer/producer Terry Dempsey's band, Plastik Mak, which included his hit song Daydreamer and performed in after- show cabaret with musician/actress Michelle Maxwell and on the folk club stage with blues/folk guitarist Mike Dickman. She also appeared regularly with singer-songwriters Colin Shamley and Roger Lucey, guesting on their respective albums. During this period she assisted in running the door for Club Le Chaim, which featured musicians opposed to the Apartheid regime. In the year before she departed Johannesburg for London in early 1986, O'Donnell co-wrote the repertoire and performed with contemporary jazz group Earthlings at night. By day she worked for South African Associated Newspapers, which at that time included The Rand Daily Mail and The Sunday Times. =Later music career= Between 1986 and 1996 O'Donnell worked in public sector administration in London. At this time interest in Mellow Candle was gathering pace. The pre- drums demos were released as The Virgin Prophet and the re-mastered Swaddling Songs has been reissued on vinyl and CD regularly since then. In 2006 a Mojo magazine poll Beyond Folk the group was listed in the top 50 genre-bending folk classics of the last forty years. The band features in a number of Top Ten lists in Galactic Ramble (a complete study of 60s and 70s music in the UK). Tracks are regularly licensed out to compilations, amongst them, O'Donnell's Messenger Birds for The Story of British Folk (a double CD collection covering British folk music from the early 60s to modern day contemporaries), the co-written Sheep Season on Early Morning Hush, Notes from the Folk Underground 1969‚Äì1976, and Heaven Heath on Legends of Ireland.Compilation: The Story of British Folk from Fairport Convention to Johnny Flynn, Spectrum Music (Mellow Candle, Messenger Birds) 2010 ‚Äì Compilation: Early Morning Hush ‚Äì Compilation: Legends of Ireland (Rhino Records E2 75202 1998) In 2007 an original vinyl copy of Swaddling Songs sold to a Canadian eBay bidder for $2,650. In 1997 after leaving an administrative post with the London School of Economics, O'Donnell moved to Brussels, working with jazz and folk musicians, in pantomime, and giving voice coaching lessons and workshops. O'Donnell's own vocal training had included a period at the Leinster School of Music & Drama in Dublin in her teens, in Johannesburg during the mid-1970s for a six-month period with a teacher specialising in syncopation, and a further three months with a former opera singer. Traditional group √âishtlinn was formed by O'Donnell with Flemish guitarist Philip Masure in 1998. The band played in Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, releasing the album, √âist Linn in 2001. O'Donnell returned to Ireland in 2001 but continued to work with three Flemish women singers in French, Flemish and English in the band Oeda, which came joint second in the nationwide Belgian band competition Nekka-contest 2001‚Äì2002. Soetkin Collier, of Oeda, is more frequently associated with the Belgian folk group Urban Trad, who finished second in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003. O'Donnell's repatriation after 28 years away from the Irish music scene meant that she had to embark on a steep learning curve. She sings and plays bodhr√°n in sessions, festivals, gigs and charity events in Ireland and abroad, mostly collaborating with other artists. O'Donnell and a male entrant won a medal each for a \\"Newly Composed Song in English\\" at the Dublin Fleadh in 2004, they being the only two entrants in the category that year. Aside from her concert repertoire of original psych folk and trad rock songs, she has a wide repertoire of traditional, folk and jazz songs. She is a member of An G√≥il√≠n (a traditional singers' club) TAC (Traditional Arts Collective) and was part of the Howth Singing Circle. With instrumentalist Isabel N√≠ Chuire√°in, she released the album Mise agus Ise in 2006. From 2007 there were collaborations and contributions to recordings with Dave Colohan of Agitated Radio Pilot, Canadian psych folk band, Mr. Pine, Colin Harper's collective The Field Mouse conspiracy and The Guessing Game, the 9th album from the Doom metal band Cathedral. In 2008 O'Donnell featured on a vinyl double A-Side single of Nick Drake's Day is Done and Nico's Frozen Warnings with Graeme Lockett of Head South By Weaving and an EP, The Fabric of Folk, with The Owl Service. They appeared together at the Green Man Festival. O'Donnell and Steven Collins of The Owl Service have collaborated regularly, including on several tracks for her first solo album, Hey Hey Hippy Witch, released in 2010. Other contributors and collaborators on this project are Michael Tyack of the psychedelic folk rock band Circulus, Kevin Scott of Mr. Pine, Head South By Weaving and Gavin Prior and Dave Colohan of United Bible Studies. In 2008 O'Donnell became a member of United Bible Studies, an experimental psych folk collective which draws on students from a number of countriesArticle on United Bible Studies The Wire, issue 382, December 2015. and has contributed to a prolific output of albums and recording projects since that time.Irish acts making their way in the ‚ÄòNew Weird‚Äô scene - Offbeat and hard to categorise, the music movement is being led by labels around the country By Ed Power, The Sunday Times (August 16 2020) She contributed to their 2009 album The Jonah and a UBS/Jozef Van Wissem vinyl album, Downland, in 2011.

She has one daughter, Kate Brower, born London 1988. O'Donnell has worked under her mother's maiden name since 1980. O'Donnell developed an interest in Genealogy in 1996, working extensively on her family tree. This led to an appearance in the BBC Four documentary series Family Ties (a precursor to Who Do You Think You Are?) in 2004. The programme focused on her grandmother Nina, a singer who, long after her death, was revealed to be a secret bigamist with another family living in Scotland (the two branches of the family are now in contact). O'Donnell's musical heritage hails from her English maternal granny, Irish great grandfather Peter, and her grandfather P.S.G. O'Donnell and his two brothers Rudolph Peter and Bertram Walton, military musicians with distinguished careers with the Royal Marines Band Service during the first half of the twentieth century. O'Donnell is an animal-lover, particularly of cats and dogs. She lives in Dublin.

By her daughter Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa, she was the maternal grandmother of Queen Margaret Leijonhufvud and thereby great grandmother of King John III of Sweden and King Charles IX of Sweden. She is remembered as one of several possible people later identified with the famous legend of Pintorpafrun. Biography Anna Karlsdotter was the daughter of noble riksr√•d Karl Bengtsson (1454-1495) of the Vinstorpa family and Katarina \\"Karin\\" Lagesdotter Sparre (d. 1493), and sister of knight and riksr√•d √ñrjan Karlsson (d. 1500). In 1488, she married to riksr√•d lord Erik Karlsson Vasa of St√§keholm and Rumlaborg, a cousin of Erik Johansson Vasa, father of Gustav I of Sweden. She became a widow when her husband was shot in 1491 for harassing a priest. In 1492, she remarried Erik Eriksson Gyllenstierna the Younger, who was lynched in 1502 for having capitulated to the Danes at √Ñlvsborg. She had many children, among them Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa and Margareta von Melen. Upon the death of her childless brother, she became the last descendant of the Vinstorpa family III, and the heir of the family estates. After having been widowed a second time, she bought the manor Pinntorp in Sudermannia in 1508, and devoted the rest of her life to the management of her estates. In addition to the estates she inherited, she expanded her lands by acquired more and more land in V√§sterg√∂tland over a period of almost fifty years, and became a very substantial, rich and noted landowner. In 1520, for example, her son-in-law borrowed money from her to be able to lodge her daughter Ebba and their children in V√§ster√•s Abbey while he attended the coronation in Stockholm, something that saved them from the Stockholm Bloodbath.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi √∂ver Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016 Upon the marriage of her granddaughter Margaret Leijonhufvud to the king in 1536, she benefited as did all the relatives of Margaret and was granted land and privileges such as the right to certain taxes and fines from the king.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi √∂ver Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016 As a landowner, Anna has been pointed out as one of the possible people identified with pintorpafrun, the infamous \\"Pintorpa lady\\" known for torturing her tenants to death. While she did own the estate Pintorpa, there are no sources which portray her as cruel, and a more likely person behind the pintorpafrun is Barbro Eriksdotter (Bielke). She was however known for being a firm and tough businessperson, who did not hesitate to involve in conflict and court cases over inheritance and land disputes in her accumulation of land, and during the 1520s, she was reportedly involved in a number of court cases over land with several members of the royal council.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi √∂ver Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016 In contrast to her daughter Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa and granddaughter Margaret Leijonhufvud, lady Anna does not appear to have been a supporter of the Catholic church. In her business ambitions, she took advantage of the new law introduced by the Swedish Reformation, which allowed for people to retract property donated to the church by their ancestors in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden, and confiscated property from the Skara Church by retracting the donation letters, on her own accord and without asking for the necessary permit from the king, \\"more or less by force, but was ordered in a strict letter from the King to give it back to His Majesty\\".Wilhelmina St√•lberg and P.

It is considered the highest honor an American thoroughbred broodmare can receive, as the majority of American breeding stock resides in Kentucky. It is a subjective vote, as opposed to the title for leading sire in North America that looks strictly at the earnings of the stallion's progeny in the given year. The current criteria are that the mare be evaluated on the success of one particular offspring, conceived and foaled in Kentucky and a winner of a grade 1 stakes race in the award year. Consideration may also be given to previous foals, specifically the number of stakes winners produced and their earnings. The rules were more relaxed in the past, essentially requiring only that \\"the mare be boarded in Kentucky.\\" Regardless, the list of honorees is highly distinguished.

It was established in 1849 as a community for and by former African- American slaves who escaped to Canada to gain freedom. Rev. William King, a Scots-Irish/American Presbyterian minister and abolitionist, had organized the Elgin Association to buy 9,000 acres of land for resettlement of the refugees, to give them a start in Canada. Within a few years, numerous families were living here, having cleared land, built houses, and developed crops. They established schools and churches, and were thriving before the American Civil War. There was great interest in the settlement among Americans. Buxton was visited by a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune in 1857, and by the head of the American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission in the summer of 1863, established after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation had freed many slaves in the American South during the Civil War. These reports praised the achievements of the people of Buxton and other African Americans in Canada. The community is within the Chatham-Kent municipality, at the junction of Chatham-Kent Roads 6 and 14. Its population in the early 21st century is approximately 250, over half of whom are Black Canadians. North Buxton's historic population peaked at more than 2000, almost exclusively descendants of free blacks and fugitive slaves who had escaped the United States via the Underground Railroad. Upper Canada (i.e. the province of Ontario after the Dominion of Canada was confederated in 1867) was the first jurisdiction in the world to abolish slavery, in 1793. Great Britain abolished slavery in its colonies in 1838, and it had never been widespread in Canada. The related community is South Buxton. History The North Buxton community was established in 1849 by Rev. William King, a Scots-Irish/American abolitionist. He had immigrated from Scotland to the United States as a young man, worked as a teacher and tutor to planters' families for years in Louisiana, and married into a planter family. After his wife died, he inherited her estate, including 15 slaves.\\"History of Elgin\\", Buxton Museum He initially allowed the slaves to keep fees earned after being hired out. After becoming a Presbyterian minister and missionary in Canada, King decided to free his slaves and relocate them to that free country. He worked with the Governor General, Lord Elgin, to create the Elgin Association, to manage development of a 9,000-acre parcel near Lake Erie for a community where freedmen and fugitive slaves, known as Negro refugees in Canada, might settle. The Elgin Settlement eventually was organized as the communities of North and South Buxton. The Association provided land at low cost, and financing for those who would build a house and develop the land, to aid the African Americans. In the years before the American Civil War, these refugee slaves usually reached Canada via the Underground Railroad from the United States. Thousands had been settling in southwest Ontario, as it was easily reached from a number of midwestern states and western New York. Among the notable residents was William Parker, a leader of the Christiana Resistance in 1851 in the free state of Pennsylvania, where he and his neighbors fought off a party trying to capture four fugitive slaves from Maryland. From Buxton, he became a correspondent of Frederick Douglass' newspaper, The North Star. He was active in the community and was elected to local office for many years. The growing population was visited by Americans, in addition to Canadians interested in its progress. A reporter from the New York Herald Tribune wrote admiringly about it in 1857. During the late years of the American Civil War, after the Emancipation Proclamation in early 1863 freed many slaves in the South, a Freedmen's Inquiry Commission was established by the Secretary of War to gather information about the \\"condition and capacity\\" of the \\"population just set free.\\" On its behalf, Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe and J.M.W. Yerrinton, as secretary and reporter, visited numerous communities in Canada West (present- day Ontario) during the summer of 1863 to gather information about the many former American slaves who had gained freedom and settled there. Among those communities was Buxton. He wrote, > Buxton is certainly a very interesting place. Sixteen years ago it was a > wilderness ... Twenty years ago most of them [inhabitants] were slaves, who > owned nothing, not even their children. Now they own themselves; they own > their houses and farms; they have their wives and children about them. They > are the enfranchised citizens of a government that protects their rights ... > The present condition of all these colonists as compared with their former > one is remarkable ... This settlement is a perfect success ...Howe (1864), > Refugees from Slavery in Canada West, pp. 70-71 In the 1860s, there was a fire at their local pearlash factory. As the bell rang to warn the citizens, many men gathered to stop the fire, but the factory could not be saved. Thus, a source of income was lost from the community. However, Buxton was doing well in other aspects and managed to stick through the situation. In the nineteenth century, the community operated three schools; the former slaves placed emphasis on education and literacy for adults and children as the key to progress. Its education was considered so superior that nearby whites sent their children to attend these schools.\\"Underground Railroad and North Buxton\\", Singing Quilter Blog Over time, descendants have moved from these rural communities to cities for urban opportunities, and the population has declined. Legacy *The Buxton National Historic Site and Museum is dedicated to the African Americans and their Black Canadian descendants, who found freedom in Canada via the Underground Railroad. The museum complex includes an historic schoolhouse, residence and barn.
